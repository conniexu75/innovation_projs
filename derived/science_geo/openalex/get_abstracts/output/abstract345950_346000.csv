https://openalex.org/W2148927308,"For accurate and reliable gene expression analysis, normalization of gene expression data against housekeeping genes (reference or internal control genes) is required. It is known that commonly used housekeeping genes (e.g. ACTB, GAPDH, HPRT1, and B2M) vary considerably under different experimental conditions and therefore their use for normalization is limited. We performed a meta-analysis of 13,629 human gene array samples in order to identify the most stable expressed genes. Here we show novel candidate housekeeping genes (e.g. RPS13, RPL27, RPS20 and OAZ1) with enhanced stability among a multitude of different cell types and varying experimental conditions. None of the commonly used housekeeping genes were present in the top 50 of the most stable expressed genes. In addition, using 2,543 diverse mouse gene array samples we were able to confirm the enhanced stability of the candidate novel housekeeping genes in another mammalian species. Therefore, the identified novel candidate housekeeping genes seem to be the most appropriate choice for normalizing gene expression data."
https://openalex.org/W2053901332,"The role of DNA cytosine methylation, an epigenetic regulator of chromatin structure and function, during normal and pathological brain development and aging remains unclear. Here, we examined by MethyLight PCR the DNA methylation status at 50 loci, encompassing primarily 5' CpG islands of genes related to CNS growth and development, in temporal neocortex of 125 subjects ranging in age from 17 weeks of gestation to 104 years old. Two psychiatric disease cohorts--defined by chronic neurodegeneration (Alzheimer's) or lack thereof (schizophrenia)--were included. A robust and progressive rise in DNA methylation levels across the lifespan was observed for 8/50 loci (GABRA2, GAD1, HOXA1, NEUROD1, NEUROD2, PGR, STK11, SYK) typically in conjunction with declining levels of the corresponding mRNAs. Another 16 loci were defined by a sharp rise in DNA methylation levels within the first few months or years after birth. Disease-associated changes were limited to 2/50 loci in the Alzheimer's cohort, which appeared to reflect an acceleration of the age-related change in normal brain. Additionally, methylation studies on sorted nuclei provided evidence for bidirectional methylation events in cortical neurons during the transition from childhood to advanced age, as reflected by significant increases at 3, and a decrease at 1 of 10 loci. Furthermore, the DNMT3a de novo DNA methyl-transferase was expressed across all ages, including a subset of neurons residing in layers III and V of the mature cortex. Therefore, DNA methylation is dynamically regulated in the human cerebral cortex throughout the lifespan, involves differentiated neurons, and affects a substantial portion of genes predominantly by an age-related increase."
https://openalex.org/W2015144766,"Near coincidental pre- and postsynaptic action potentials induce associative long-term potentiation (LTP) or long-term depression (LTD), depending on the order of their timing. Here, we show that in visual cortex the rules of this spike-timing-dependent plasticity are not rigid, but shaped by neuromodulator receptors coupled to adenylyl cyclase (AC) and phospholipase C (PLC) signaling cascades. Activation of the AC and PLC cascades results in phosphorylation of postsynaptic glutamate receptors at sites that serve as specific ""tags"" for LTP and LTD. As a consequence, the outcome (i.e., whether LTP or LTD) of a given pattern of pre- and postsynaptic firing depends not only on the order of the timing, but also on the relative activation of neuromodulator receptors coupled to AC and PLC. These findings indicate that cholinergic and adrenergic neuromodulation associated with the behavioral state of the animal can control the gating and the polarity of cortical plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W1997282555,"Endocytosis of AMPA receptors and other postsynaptic cargo occurs at endocytic zones (EZs), stably positioned sites of clathrin adjacent to the postsynaptic density (PSD). The tight localization of postsynaptic endocytosis is thought to control spine composition and regulate synaptic transmission. However, the mechanisms that situate the EZ near the PSD and the role of spine endocytosis in synaptic transmission are unknown. Here, we report that a physical link between dynamin-3 and the postsynaptic adaptor Homer positions the EZ near the PSD. Disruption of dynamin-3 or its interaction with Homer uncouples the PSD from the EZ, resulting in synapses lacking postsynaptic clathrin. Loss of the EZ leads to a loss of synaptic AMPA receptors and reduced excitatory synaptic transmission that corresponds with impaired synaptic recycling. Thus, a physical link between the PSD and the EZ ensures localized endocytosis and recycling by recapturing and maintaining a proximate pool of cycling AMPA receptors.

Thus, a physical link between the PSD and the EZ ensures localized endocytosis and recycling by recapturing and maintaining a proximate pool of cycling AMPA receptors. Rapid excitatory synaptic transmission at glutamatergic synapses is mediated by AMPA receptors, which are highly mobile at the postsynaptic membrane (Derkach et al., 2007Derkach V.A. Oh M.C.

AMPA receptors, along with other postsynaptic membrane proteins, can diffuse out of the postsynaptic density (Tardin et al., 2003Tardin C. Cognet L. Bats C. Lounis B. Choquet D.

Such endocytic trafficking is regulated by neuronal activity and mediates diverse forms of synaptic plasticity (Park et al., 2004Park M. Penick E.C. Edwards J.G. Kauer J.A.

Recent studies have found that the endocytosis of postsynaptic cargo occurs at endocytic zones (EZs), stably positioned sites of clathrin assembly adjacent to the postsynaptic density (PSD) (Blanpied et al., 2002Blanpied T.A.

Blanpied T.A. Ehlers M.D. Weinberg R.J. Lateral organization of endocytic machinery in dendritic spines.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 917-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The tight localization of postsynaptic endocytosis is thought to control postsynaptic membrane composition and regulate diverse aspects of synaptic transmission and plasticity (Kennedy and Ehlers, 2006Kennedy M.J. Ehlers M.D. Organelles and trafficking machinery for postsynaptic plasticity.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 29: 325-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms that position the endocytic machinery near the PSD, and the role of spine-localized endocytosis in synaptic transmission, are unknown. In model mammalian cell lines, clathrin-mediated endocytosis occurs at discrete clathrin coat domains, uniformly distributed over the cell membrane with no known spatial relationship to other cellular structures (Gaidarov et al., 1999Gaidarov I.

In contrast, clathrin puncta and coated pits on hippocampal neuron dendrites exhibit a highly specific localization a few hundred nanometers adjacent to the PSD (Blanpied et al., 2002Blanpied T.A.

At the postsynaptic membrane, endocytic proteins such as clathrin and dynamin form part of the NMDAR/PSD-95 protein complex (Tu et al., 1998Tu J.C. Xiao B. Yuan J.P. Lanahan A.A. Leoffert K. Li M.

In addition, both the PSD and the clathrin endocytic apparatus share common linkages to the actin cytoskeleton (Naisbitt et al., 1999Naisbitt S. Kim E. Tu J.C. Xiao B. Sala C. Valtschanoff J. Weinberg R.J. Worley P.F. Sheng M.

Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 404-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Such studies suggest a molecular interface that directly or indirectly connects the PSD to endocytic structures. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is initiated by the recruitment of clathrin coat components to the plasma membrane, followed by invagination of the membrane to form a clathrin-coated pit (Kaksonen et al., 2006Kaksonen M. Toret C.P. Drubin D.G. Harnessing actin dynamics for clathrin-mediated endocytosis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 404-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Fission of clathrin-coated pits is mediated by large GTPases of the dynamin family, which oligomerize around the necks of invaginated pits (Praefcke and McMahon, 2004Praefcke G.J. McMahon H.T. The dynamin superfamily: universal membrane tubulation and fission molecules?.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated an expanded role for dynamin as a scaffold that coordinates membrane dynamics and cytoskeletal reorganization at actin-rich regions of cells, including membrane ruffles, podosomes, actin comets, mitotic cleavage furrows, and growth cones (Schafer, 2004Schafer D.A. Regulating actin dynamics at membranes: a focus on dynamin.Traffic. 2004; 5: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, Kruchten and McNiven, 2006Kruchten A.E. McNiven M.A. Dynamin as a mover and pincher during cell migration and invasion.J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1683-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Dynamins are targeted to these subcellular domains by protein interactions involving their C-terminal proline-rich domain (PRD) (Praefcke and McMahon, 2004Praefcke G.J. McMahon H.T. The dynamin superfamily: universal membrane tubulation and fission molecules?.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). Such targeting may couple endocytosis to cytoskeletal remodeling at defined zones on the plasma membrane (Kruchten and McNiven, 2006Kruchten A.E. McNiven M.A. Dynamin as a mover and pincher during cell migration and invasion.J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1683-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Three different vertebrate dynamin genes have been identified (Cao et al., 1998Cao H. Garcia F. McNiven M.A. Differential distribution of dynamin isoforms in mammalian cells.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2595-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The brain-enriched dynamin-1 concentrates in presynaptic terminals and plays a dominant role in synaptic vesicle endocytosis (Nakata et al., 1991Nakata T. Iwamoto A. Noda Y. Takemura R. Yoshikura H. Hirokawa N. Predominant and developmentally regulated expression of dynamin in neurons.Neuron. 1991; 7: 461-469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Dynamin-2 is expressed ubiquitously and similarly participates in membrane fission (Cook et al., 1994Cook T.A. Urrutia R. McNiven M.A. Identification of dynamin 2, an isoform ubiquitously expressed in rat tissues.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1994; 91: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In contrast, dynamin-3 is enriched in the brain and has been localized postsynaptically (Gray et al., 2003Gray N.W. Fourgeaud L. Huang B. Chen J. Cao H. Oswald B.J. Hemar A. McNiven M.A. Dynamin 3 is a component of the postsynapse, where it interacts with mGluR5 and Homer.Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 510-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Whereas dynamin-1 and -2 play important roles in membrane scission during endocytosis, the precise function of dynamin-3 is still undefined. Notably, dynamin-3 is the only dynamin isoform known to bind the postsynaptic adaptor Homer (Gray et al., 2003Gray N.W. Fourgeaud L. Huang B. Chen J. Cao H. Oswald B.J. Hemar A. McNiven M.A. Dynamin 3 is a component of the postsynapse, where it interacts with mGluR5 and Homer.Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 510-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), potentially linking dynamin-3 to the PSD scaffold. At the core of the dense postsynaptic protein network reside multivalent scaffolds of the Shank/ProSAP family (Naisbitt et al., 1999Naisbitt S. Kim E. Tu J.C. Xiao B. Sala C. Valtschanoff J. Weinberg R.J. Worley P.F. Sheng M.

Hoogenraad C.C. The postsynaptic architecture of excitatory synapses: A more quantitative view.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 823-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Shank interacts with numerous partners, including GKAP/SAPAP adaptor proteins that couple Shank to the NMDA receptor/PSD-95 complex (Naisbitt et al., 1999Naisbitt S. Kim E. Tu J.C. Xiao B. Sala C.

Biol. 2003; 13: 510-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Formation of a Shank-Homer complex promotes maturation of glutamatergic synapses, triggers the recruitment of synaptic AMPA receptors, and increases synaptic strength (Sala et al., 2001Sala C. Piech V. Wilson N.R. Passafaro M. Liu G. Sheng M. Regulation of dendritic spine morphology and synaptic function by Shank and Homer.Neuron. 2001; 31: 115-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Yet, little is known about the downstream effectors of Homer that regulate AMPA receptor abundance at the postsynaptic membrane. In the present study, we have investigated the molecular mechanisms that link the EZ to the PSD and the function of spatially localized endocytosis in excitatory synaptic transmission. Using a combination of live-cell imaging, electrophysiology, and quantitative light and electron microscopy, we demonstrate that dynamin-3 positions the clathrin endocytic machinery near the PSD through interaction with the postsynaptic scaffold complex Homer/Shank. Disruption of dynamin-3 uncouples the PSD from the EZ, leading to a loss of synaptic AMPA receptors, and depresses excitatory synaptic transmission due to a failure of endocytosed receptors to locally recycle back to the synapse. These results define a direct physical link between the postsynaptic scaffold and spine trafficking machinery and demonstrate a novel requirement for localized endocytosis and recycling in maintaining a synaptically proximate pool of cycling AMPA receptors. Establishment of local endocytic cycling thereby links spatially delimited membrane trafficking to synapse-specific signaling. To examine the persistence and mobility of coated pits at PSD-associated endocytic zones (EZs), we monitored clathrin puncta in dendrites by confocal time-lapse imaging. In the dendrites of cultured hippocampal neurons expressing PSD-95-GFP and clathrin-DsRed (17 days in vitro [DIV]), clathrin-DsRed was distributed in a punctate pattern in the dendritic shaft and at sites adjacent to individual PSDs labeled by PSD-95-GFP (Figure 1A). To monitor the behavior of clathrin puncta, we used kymograph analysis to plot the fluorescence intensity of a line in the dendrite over time. Kymographs of clathrin spots near PSD-95 puncta consisted almost entirely of vertical bands stretching the duration of the time lapse, indicating that clusters of PSD-95-GFP and clathrin remain tightly associated with each other and are nearly immobile (Figure 1B and Movie S1 [see the Supplemental Data available with this article online]). In contrast, clathrin puncta at sites distant from the PSD were considerably more mobile (Figure 1B and Movie S1). We occasionally observed mobile PSD-95 puncta moving along the dendrite at an average rate of 0.2 μm/min. Similar to previous observations (Gerrow et al., 2006Gerrow K. Romorini S. Nabi S.M. Colicos M.A. Sala C. El-Husseini A. A preformed complex of postsynaptic proteins is involved in excitatory synapse development.Neuron. 2006; 49: 547-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), these mobile PSD-95 puncta contained Shank, Homer, and GKAP and likely represent a preformed complex. Surprisingly, mobile PSD-95 clusters continued to have an associated clathrin punctum (Figure 1C and Movie S2). In addition, some PSDs underwent significant time-dependent changes in size and morphology, yet clathrin puncta always remained physically proximate (Figure 1D and Movie S3). These data show that, unlike coated pits away from synapses, clathrin near the PSD is stable and remains in close proximity to the PSD. Requisite for a molecule linking the PSD with the EZ is the ability to associate with components of the postsynaptic scaffold and with organizing proteins of the endocytic apparatus. We took advantage of the fact that 10%–15% of dendritic spines in mature hippocampal neurons lack an EZ (Blanpied et al., 2002Blanpied T.A. Scott D.B. Ehlers M.D. Dynamics and regulation of clathrin coats at specialized endocytic zones of dendrites and spines.Neuron. 2002; 36: 435-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) to search for PSD scaffolds and endocytic proteins whose abundance in spines correlated with the presence of an EZ. From this, we identified dynamin-3, a member of the dynamin family of large GTPases. We selected dynamin-3 among candidate proteins for several reasons. First, dynamin-3 has been found to reside in postsynaptic compartments, and a specific splice variant of dynamin-3 regulates dendritic spines (Gray et al., 2003Gray N.W. Fourgeaud L. Huang B. Chen J. Cao H. Oswald B.J. Hemar A. McNiven M.A. Dynamin 3 is a component of the postsynapse, where it interacts with mGluR5 and Homer.Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 510-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, Gray et al., 2005Gray N.W. Kruchten A.E. Chen J. McNiven M.A. A dynamin-3 spliced variant modulates the actin/cortactin-dependent morphogenesis of dendritic spines.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Second, dynamin-3 binds to the postsynaptic adaptor protein Homer1 (Gray et al., 2003Gray N.W. Fourgeaud L. Huang B. Chen J. Cao H. Oswald B.J. Hemar A. McNiven M.A. Dynamin 3 is a component of the postsynapse, where it interacts with mGluR5 and Homer.Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 510-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Third, dynamin-3 is homologous to, and may oligomerize with, dynamin-1 and dynamin-2, which are well-studied components of the clathrin endocytic machinery (Praefcke and McMahon, 2004Praefcke G.J. McMahon H.T. The dynamin superfamily: universal membrane tubulation and fission molecules?.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar, Kruchten and McNiven, 2006Kruchten A.E. McNiven M.A. Dynamin as a mover and pincher during cell migration and invasion.J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1683-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Fourth, dynamin-3 expression is largely restricted to brain and is upregulated during developmental periods of synapse formation (Gray et al., 2003Gray N.W. Fourgeaud L. Huang B. Chen J. Cao H. Oswald B.J. Hemar A. McNiven M.A. Dynamin 3 is a component of the postsynapse, where it interacts with mGluR5 and Homer.Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 510-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, Gray et al., 2005Gray N.W. Kruchten A.E. Chen J. McNiven M.A. A dynamin-3 spliced variant modulates the actin/cortactin-dependent morphogenesis of dendritic spines.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous studies (Gray et al., 2003Gray N.W. Fourgeaud L. Huang B. Chen J. Cao H. Oswald B.J. Hemar A. McNiven M.A. Dynamin 3 is a component of the postsynapse, where it interacts with mGluR5 and Homer.Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 510-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), immunostaining of cultured hippocampal neurons showed that dynamin-3 is highly enriched in dendritic spines (Figures 2A), and double labeling for dynamin-3 and PSD-95 revealed a partial overlap between these two proteins (data not shown) (Gray et al., 2003Gray N.W. Fourgeaud L. Huang B. Chen J. Cao H. Oswald B.J. Hemar A. McNiven M.A. Dynamin 3 is a component of the postsynapse, where it interacts with mGluR5 and Homer.Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 510-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To obtain a numerical index of spine targeting, we measured the ratio of fluorescence intensity between the spine head and the dendritic shaft and found the spine/shaft ratio of endogenous dynamin-3 to be 2.8-fold higher than GFP (Figure 2B; n = 8 neurons, 270 spines, p < 0.001). To ensure that spine-localized dynamin-3 was postsynaptic and did not reflect presynaptic dynamin-3, we expressed dynamin-3-EGFP selectively in postsynaptic neurons. Under these conditions, Dyn3-EGFP strongly localized to dendritic spines (Figure S1A). Because 10%–15% of spines do not contain clathrin puncta (Blanpied et al., 2002Blanpied T.A. Scott D.B. Ehlers M.D. Dynamics and regulation of clathrin coats at specialized endocytic zones of dendrites and spines.Neuron. 2002; 36: 435-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), we wondered whether the presence of dynamin-3 correlated with the presence of EZ in spines. Hippocampal neurons expressing GFP and clathrin-DsRed were fixed and stained for dynamin-3, and the integrated fluorescent intensity was measured in spines separated into two groups according to the presence (EZ+) or absence (EZ−) of clathrin-DsRed. Visual inspection indicated that spines lacking dynamin-3 also lacked clathrin puncta (Figure 2C). Quantitative analysis revealed that spines containing endocytic zones (EZ+) had nearly 2.5-fold higher levels of dynamin-3 than EZ-negative spines (Figure 2D). Thus, the presence of dynamin-3 correlates with the presence of a spine EZ. To determine the precise subcellular localization of dynamin-3 within spines, we performed immunogold electron microscopy on CA1 hippocampus stratum radiatum from adult rat. Consistent with previous studies (Gray et al., 2003Gray N.W. Fourgeaud L. Huang B. Chen J. Cao H. Oswald B.J. Hemar A. McNiven M.A. Dynamin 3 is a component of the postsynapse, where it interacts with mGluR5 and Homer.Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 510-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), gold particles corresponding to dynamin-3 were localized to postsynaptic compartments of asymmetric synapses (Figure 3A). Presynaptic labeling was also observed (data not shown) but was not analyzed further. Within dendritic spines, dynamin-3 was sparse within the PSD but was frequently observed at membrane domains lateral to the peripheral edge of the PSD (Figure 3A). To quantify the lateral position of dynamin-3, we measured the tangential distance of each particle away from the edge of the PSD along the plasma membrane (Racz et al., 2004Racz B. Blanpied T.A. Ehlers M.D. Weinberg R.J. Lateral organization of endocytic machinery in dendritic spines.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 917-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) (see Experimental Procedures for details). Measurement of absolute distance showed that dynamin-3 was situated 324 ± 32 nm lateral to the PSD on average. To control for variation in spine size, particle positions were normalized such that 0 corresponded to the PSD edge and 1.0 to the point along the perimeter of the spine equidistant from both edges of the PSD. This analysis revealed that dynamin-3 concentrates at lateral spine membrane domains midway between the PSD edge and the furthest tangential point (normalized tangential position: 0.51 ± 0.03; Figure 3B). The observed lateral distribution of dynamin-3 was similar to that for clathrin (0.48 ± 0.02, 340 ± 15 nm) and the clathrin adaptor AP-2 (0.41 ± 0.02, 302 ± 24 nm) (Racz et al., 2004Racz B. Blanpied T.A. Ehlers M.D. Weinberg R.J. Lateral organization of endocytic machinery in dendritic spines.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 917-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), defining the components of the spine EZ. Thus, dynamin-3 is properly situated to link the PSD and EZ. Members of the dynamin family interact with diverse proteins through their C-terminal proline-rich domains (PRDs), which are highly divergent among family members (Praefcke and McMahon, 2004Praefcke G.J. McMahon H.T. The dynamin superfamily: universal membrane tubulation and fission molecules?.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar) (Figure 4A). To test whether protein interactions involving dynamin-3 couple the EZ to the PSD, we first employed a dominant inhibitory strategy. Flag-tagged proline-rich domains (PRDs) of dynamins-1, -2, and -3 were expressed in hippocampal neurons to disrupt PRD-dependent interactions, together with PSD-95-GFP and clathrin-DsRed to mark the PSD and EZ, respectively. In control neurons, PSD-95-GFP puncta were nearly always associated with clathrin-DsRed (Figure 4B). In contrast, expression of the dynamin-3 proline-rich domain (Dyn3-PRD) resulted in a marked loss of PSD-associated clathrin puncta (Figure 4B). Expression of Dyn3-PRD did not change the total number of clathrin-positive puncta over dendrites (data not shown), supporting a selective defect in clathrin localization rather than clathrin coat formation. For quantitative analysis, we measured the percentage of PSD-95-GFP puncta that lacked an EZ. Whereas normally very few PSDs lack an associated EZ (8.4% ± 1.8%, n = 134), expression of Dyn3-PRD caused a 5-fold increase in the fraction of EZ-negative synapses (45.3% ± 3.7% EZ-negative synapses, n = 20, p < 0.001 relative to control, t test; Figure 4F). On the other hand, expression of Dyn1-PRD or Dyn2-PRD, both of which inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Luscher et al., 1999Luscher C. Xia H. Beattie E.C. Carroll R.C. von Zastrow M. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Role of AMPA receptor cycling in synaptic transmission and plasticity.Neuron. 1999; 24: 649-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, Praefcke and McMahon, 2004Praefcke G.J. McMahon H.T. The dynamin superfamily: universal membrane tubulation and fission molecules?.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar), had minimal effect on the spatial positioning of clathrin puncta adjacent to the PSD (percent EZ-negative synapses: Dyn1-PRD, 13.3% ± 2.2%, n = 20; Dyn2-PRD, 13.0% ± 1.7%, n = 16; p > 0.05 relative to control, t test; Figures 4B and 4F). Thus, protein interactions involving the PRD of dynamin-3 couple the EZ to the PSD, while dynamin-dependent endocytosis per se is not required for localizing the spine endocytic machinery. Conspicuous among proteins that uniquely bind the PRD of dynamin-3 is the postsynaptic adaptor Homer1b/c (Gray et al., 2003Gray N.W. Fourgeaud L. Huang B. Chen J. Cao H. Oswald"
https://openalex.org/W1987874272,"Previously formed memories are susceptible to disruption immediately after recall due to a necessity to be reconsolidated after retrieval. Protein translation mechanisms have been widely implicated as being necessary for memory reconsolidation, but gene transcription mechanisms have been much less extensively studied in this context. We found that retrieval of contextual conditioned fear memories activates the NF-kappaB pathway to regulate histone H3 phosphorylation and acetylation at specific gene promoters in hippocampus, specifically via IKKalpha and not the NF-kappaB DNA-binding complex. Behaviorally, we found that inhibition of IKKalpha regulation of either chromatin structure or NF-kappaB DNA-binding complex activity leads to impairments in fear memory reconsolidation, and that elevating histone acetylation rescues this memory deficit in the face of IKK blockade. These data provide insights into IKK-regulated transcriptional mechanisms in hippocampus that are necessary for memory reconsolidation."
https://openalex.org/W2161367071,"Ripples are sharp-wave-associated field oscillations (100-300 Hz) recorded in the hippocampus during behavioral immobility and slow-wave sleep. In epileptic rats and humans, a different and faster oscillation (200-600 Hz), termed fast ripples, has been described. However, the basic mechanisms are unknown. Here, we propose that fast ripples emerge from a disorganized ripple pattern caused by unreliable firing in the epileptic hippocampus. Enhanced synaptic activity is responsible for the irregular bursting of CA3 pyramidal cells due to large membrane potential fluctuations. Lower field interactions and a reduced spike-timing reliability concur with decreased spatial synchronization and the emergence of fast ripples. Reducing synaptically driven membrane potential fluctuations improves both spike-timing reliability and spatial synchronization and restores ripples in the epileptic hippocampus. Conversely, a lower spike-timing reliability, with reduced potassium currents, is associated with ripple shuffling in normal hippocampus. Therefore, fast ripples may reflect a pathological desynchronization of the normal ripple pattern."
https://openalex.org/W2084203472,"Metagenomics is emerging as a powerful method to study the function and physiology of the unexplored microbial biosphere, and is causing us to re-evaluate basic precepts of microbial ecology and evolution. Most marine metagenomic analyses have been nearly exclusively devoted to photic waters.We constructed a metagenomic fosmid library from 3,000 m-deep Mediterranean plankton, which is much warmer (approximately 14 degrees C) than waters of similar depth in open oceans (approximately 2 degrees C). We analyzed the library both by phylogenetic screening based on 16S rRNA gene amplification from clone pools and by sequencing both insert extremities of ca. 5,000 fosmids. Genome recruitment strategies showed that the majority of high scoring pairs corresponded to genomes from Rhizobiales within the Alphaproteobacteria, Cenarchaeum symbiosum, Planctomycetes, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi and Gammaproteobacteria. We have found a community structure similar to that found in the aphotic zone of the Pacific. However, the similarities were significantly higher to the mesopelagic (500-700 m deep) in the Pacific than to the single 4000 m deep sample studied at this location. Metabolic genes were mostly related to catabolism, transport and degradation of complex organic molecules, in agreement with a prevalent heterotrophic lifestyle for deep-sea microbes. However, we observed a high percentage of genes encoding dehydrogenases and, among them, cox genes, suggesting that aerobic carbon monoxide oxidation may be important in the deep ocean as an additional energy source.The comparison of metagenomic libraries from the deep Mediterranean and the Pacific ALOHA water column showed that bathypelagic Mediterranean communities resemble more mesopelagic communities in the Pacific, and suggests that, in the absence of light, temperature is a major stratifying factor in the oceanic water column, overriding pressure at least over 4000 m deep. Several chemolithotrophic metabolic pathways could supplement organic matter degradation in this most depleted habitat."
https://openalex.org/W2025761802,"Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling is known to involve interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs), however the particular role of IRAK-2 has remained unclear. Further, although IRAK-1 was originally thought to be central for the TLR-NFκB signaling axis, recent data have shown that it is dispensable for NFκB activation for some TLRs and demonstrated an alternative role for it in interferon regulatory factor activation. Here we show that IRAK-2 is critical for the TLR-mediated NFκB activation pathway. The poxviral TLR antagonist A52 inhibited NFκB activation by TLR2, -3, -4, -5, -7, and -9 ligands, via its interaction with IRAK-2, while not affecting interferon regulatory factor activation. Knockdown of IRAK-2 expression by small interfering RNA suppressed TLR3, TLR4, and TLR8 signaling to NFκB in human cell lines, and importantly, TLR4-mediated chemokine production in primary human cells. IRAK-2 usage by different TLRs was distinct, because it acted downstream of the TLR adaptors MyD88 and Mal but upstream of TRIF. Expression of IRAK-2, but not IRAK-1, led to TRAF6 ubiquitination, an event critical for NFκB activation. Further, IRAK-2 loss-of-function mutants, which could not activate NFκB, were incapable of promoting TRAF6 ubiquitination.

Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2006; 311: 1-16PubMed Google Scholar). TLRs are part of the larger IL-1R/TLR superfamily, defined by the presence of a cytoplasmic Toll-IL-1R-resistance (TIR) signaling domain, which also includes the IL-1, IL-18, and IL-33 receptors. Upon engagement of distinct TLRs by specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such as bacterial lipoprotein (for TLR2), viral dsRNA (for TLR3), or LPS (for TLR4), intracellular signaling cascades mediate activation of transcription factors such as NFκB and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) leading to gene induction and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and interferons. Upon activation, IL-1R and all of the TLRs, excluding only TLR3, recruit the TIR domain-containing adaptor molecule myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) through a TIR-TIR homotypic protein interaction, leading to NFκB activation (2Medzhitov R.

TLR3 utilizes another TIR adaptor known as TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon β (TRIF) (5Oshiumi H. Matsumoto M. Funami K. Akazawa T. Seya T. Nat.

TLR4 can also signal through TRIF, via a bridging adaptor called TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM), resulting in a delayed MyD88-independent NFκB response (7Oshiumi H. Sasai M. Shida K. Fujita T.

Both IRAK-1 and IRAK-4 are active Ser/Thr kinases, and phosphorylation of IRAK-1 by IRAK-4 is crucial for IRAK-1 activation during TLR signaling (9Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X.

Cell. 2002; 110: 191-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar). Previous studies have implicated IRAK-2 in IL-1R and TLR4 signaling by showing that IRAK-2 can associate with MyD88 and Mal (3Fitzgerald K.A. Palsson-McDermott E.M. Bowie A.G. Jefferies C.A.

Furthermore, the poxvirus protein A52, which interacts with both IRAK-2 and TRAF6, can inhibit TLR-induced NFκB activation (17Bowie A. Kiss-Toth E. Symons J.A. Smith G.L. Dower S.K. O'Neill L.A.

Here we present evidence that A52 inhibits NFκB solely via its interaction with IRAK-2 and not TRAF6, and that IRAK-2 is required for all TLR-mediated pathways to NFκB. We show that IRAK-2, but not IRAK-1 causes TRAF6 ubiquitination, a critical step in the activation of NFκB by TLRs. Thus we propose that IRAK-2 has a more fundamental role than IRAK-1, in the TLR-NFκB axis. Expression Vectors—Generation of the A52 and ΔA52 expression vectors has been described previously (17Bowie A. Kiss-Toth E. Symons J.A. Smith G.L. Dower S.K. O'Neill L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Muzio, Mario Negri Institute, Milan, Italy), TLR3-FLAG (D. Golenbock, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worchester, MA), CD4-TLR4 (R.

Fitzgerald, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worchester, MA), TRIF (C. Basler, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY), and HA-ubiquitin (A. Mansell, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia). Antibodies and Reagents—Antibodies used were: anti-Myc mAb, anti-β-actin mAb, and anti-FLAG mAb (Sigma); anti-HA mAb (Covance); anti-IRAK-1 mAb and anti-TRAF6 polyclonal Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); and anti-IRAK-2 polyclonal Ab (Upstate Biotechnologies). Human recombinant IL-1α was from NCI, National Institutes of Health (Frederick, MD). TLR agonists used were synthetic tripalmitoyl lipopeptide Pam3Cys-Ser-(Lys)4 (Pam3CSK4, InvivoGen), 2-kDa macrophage-activating lipopeptide (MALP-2; Alexis), poly(I:C) (Amersham Biosciences), LPS (Alexis), flagellin (a gift from A. Gewirtz, Emory University, Atlanta, GA), R-848 and CL075 (InvivoGen), and phosphothioate CpG (Sigma). Reporter Gene Assays—NFκB, p38 MAP kinase, IRF3, IRF5, and IRF7 activation as well as IL-8 promoter induction were measured by reporter gene assay. HEK293 or RAW264.7 cells were seeded into 96-well plates at 2 × 104 and 4 × 104 cells per well, respectively, and co-transfected with luciferase reporter gene plasmids and expression plasmids 24 h later using the Genejuice® transfection reagent (Novagen) as described previously (20Stack J. Haga I.R. Schroder M. Bartlett N.W. Maloney G. Reading P.C. Fitzgerald K.A. Smith G.L. Bowie A.G. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 1007-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 21Carty M. Goodbody R.

For all assays, 20 ng of phRL-TK reporter (Promega) per transfection was included to normalize data for transfection efficiency, and total DNA concentrations were kept constant at 230 ng (for HEK293) or 200 ng (for RAW264.7) by the addition of pcDNA3.1 empty vector (Invitrogen). For measurement of NFκB activity, 60 ng of a κB-luciferase reporter gene was used. The Pathdetect System (Stratagene) was used to assess p38 MAP kinase activity with 0.25 ng of a CHOP-Gal4 fusion protein expression vector co-transfected with 60 ng of the pFR-luciferase reporter plasmid. IRF activity was determined by co-transfection of 3 ng of either IRF3-, IRF5-, or IRF7-Gal4 fusion protein expression vectors as required in conjunction with the pFR-luciferase reporter plasmid (60 ng). Cells were stimulated with TLR agonists for 6 h prior to lysis and measurement of luciferase activity 24 h following transfection. All transfections were done in triplicate, and data are expressed as -fold induction (mean ± S.D.) relative to control levels for a representative experiment of a minimum of three separate experiments. ELISA—IL-8 was measured by ELISA (20Stack J. Haga I.R. Schroder M. Bartlett N.W. Maloney G. Reading P.C. Fitzgerald K.A. Smith G.L. Bowie A.G. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 1007-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Each experiment was done in triplicate, and data are expressed as picograms/ml IL8 (mean ± S.D.) for a representative of at least three independent experiments. siRNA Gene Silencing—siRNA duplexes targeting the human Irak-2 gene (Qiagen) targeted the following sites: IRAK-2A, 5′-CAGCAACGTCAAGAGCTCTAA; IRAK-2B, 5′-CCAGATCATCCTGAACTGGAA. To confirm knockdown of IRAK-2-Myc expression, HEK293 cells (3 × 105 cells) were transfected with siRNA duplexes using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), followed by transfection with IRAK-2-Myc and a second siRNA transfection 24 h later. After a further 24 h, cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For reporter gene assays, HEK293 cells in 96-well plates (3 × 104 cells per well) were transfected with siRNA duplexes and then co-transfected with reporter constructs and a second dose of siRNA 24 h later prior to stimulation with 25 μg/ml poly(I:C) or 100 ng/ml LPS for 6 h. For siRNA experiments in primary human cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from healthy donor whole blood using Lymphoprep reagent (Axis-shield), seeded in 96-well plates (8 × 104 cells per well) at 37 °C for 2 h, and transfected with siRNA as above. A second siRNA transfection was delivered 24 h later, and cells were treated for 24 h with 10 ng/ml LPS 48 h following initial transfection. Cell supernatants were harvested and IL-8 cytokine production analyzed by ELISA. Co-immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Proteins were co-immunoprecipitated from transfected HEK293T cells as previously described (20Stack J. Haga I.R. Schroder M. Bartlett N.W. Maloney G. Reading P.C. Fitzgerald K.A. Smith G.L. Bowie A.G. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 1007-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation of ubiquitinated proteins, lysis buffer was supplemented with 10 mm iodoacetamide. Target proteins were immunoprecipitated by incubating 400 μl of lysate with the relevant antibody, precoupled to protein A- or G-Sepharose beads, for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Site-directed Mutagenesis of IRAK-2—Point mutations were introduced into the IRAK-2 gene sequence using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to manufacturerŉs instructions. A52 Specifically Targets IRAK-2 to Inhibit Signal Transduction from TLRs to NFκB—Previously we showed that poxvirus protein A52 could inhibit NFκB activation by TLR2, -3, -4, or -5 in human HEK293 cells, and associate with both TRAF6 and IRAK-2 (18Harte M.T. Haga I.R. Maloney G. Gray P. Reading P.C. Bartlett N.W. Smith G.L. Bowie A. O'Neill L.A. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Here, we extended this observation to demonstrate that A52 expression antagonized ligand-induced NFκB activation through all TLRs tested, including TLR7 and TLR9, in murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 1a). Further A52 substantially reduced MALP-2- and R848-mediated NFκB induction in HEK293 cells stably expressing TLR2 and TLR8, respectively (data not shown). Thus, it appeared that A52 was capable of inhibiting all TLR pathways to NFκB, both in human and murine cells. We therefore next determined whether the ability of A52 to inhibit NFκB depended on its interaction with TRAF6 and/or IRAK-2. Previously, the A52-TRAF6 interaction has been shown to induce MAP kinase activation, whereas ΔA52, a truncated A52 protein (comprising amino acids 1–144 of the 190-residue protein) could no longer associate with TRAF6 nor induce MAP kinase activation (19Maloney G.

Because ΔA52 could still interact with IRAK-2, it provided a useful tool to investigate IRAK-2 involvement in NFκB activation. Fig. 1 (b–d) shows that A52 substantially reduced the induction of an NFκB-dependent reporter gene stimulated by exogenous treatment of IL-1R-expressing cells with IL-1α, co-expression of TLR3 and simultaneous poly(I:C) treatment or introduction of a constitutively active CD4-TLR4 chimera and compellingly, ΔA52 was as powerful a suppressor of NFκB activation via IL-1R, TLR3, and TLR4 as wild-type A52. Thus the interaction of A52 with TRAF6 is dispensable for inhibition of IL-1R- and TLR-induced NFκB activation, suggesting that it is via its association with IRAK-2 that A52 can potently antagonize TLR signaling to NFκB, thus pointing to IRAK-2 as a critical downstream component of these signaling cascades. IRAK-2 Induces NFκB and p38 MAP Kinase—As previously shown (16Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar) IRAK-2 expression, like IRAK-1, led to NFκB activation (Fig. 1e). To determine the effect of IRAK-2 on p38 MAP kinase activation, another downstream event in TLR signaling, a reporter gene assay based on the phosphorylation of the p38 substrate CHOP was utilized (20Stack J. Haga I.R. Schroder M. Bartlett N.W. Maloney G. Reading P.C. Fitzgerald K.A. Smith G.L. Bowie A.G. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 1007-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). IRAK-2 induced substantial transactivation of the reporter, to levels comparable to those seen for MyD88 expression (Fig. 1f). Although IRAK-1 failed to stimulate p38 MAP kinase activation in these assays, IRAK-1 has previously been implicated in the induction of p38 MAP kinase by IL-1 (12Kanakaraj P. Schafer P.H. Cavender D.E. Wu Y. Ngo K. Grealish P.F. Wadsworth S.A. Peterson P.A. Siekierka J.J. Harris C.A. Fung-Leung W.P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 2073-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and overexpression of IRAK-1 has been shown to induce phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase (22Schmidt A. Caron E. Hall A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 438-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). IL-8 gene induction is NFκB- and MAP kinase-dependent, and consistent with this, expression of IRAK-2 resulted in strong IL-8 promoter induction (Fig. 1g) and in the production of IL-8 (Fig. 1h), in both cases to levels comparable to those seen for IRAK-1. IRF Activation by TLRs Is Not Inhibited by the IRAK-2 Inhibitor A52—We have previously shown that, although the poxvirus protein A46, which antagonizes both MyD88- and TRIF-dependent signaling, could potently block the induction of IRF3 via TLR3, A52 could not (20Stack J. Haga I.R. Schroder M. Bartlett N.W. Maloney G. Reading P.C. Fitzgerald K.A. Smith G.L. Bowie A.G. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 1007-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). This suggested that IRAK-2 is not required for IRF3 stimulation by TLR3. To investigate the role of IRAK-2 in TLR-mediated IRF activation in a broader sense, the ability of A52 to inhibit other TLR pathways to IRFs was examined. In these assays, the IRF subunit of interest was overexpressed as a Gal4 fusion protein, and its phosphorylation, dimerization, and DNA-binding activity was assessed using a luciferase reporter construct regulated by tandem Gal4 DNA-binding sequences. A52 had no effect on the activation of IRF3 by TLR4 (Fig. 2a) or by the TLR3- and TLR4-specific downstream adaptor, TRIF (Fig. 2b). Apart from the TLR3/4-TRIF-IRF3 pathway, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 can also induce IRF5 and IRF7 activation via MyD88 (23Schoenemeyer A. Barnes B.J. Mancl M.E. Latz E. Goutagny N. Pitha P.M.

Takaoka A. Yeh W.C. Taniguchi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15416-15421Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), and similar to the TRIF-IRF3 pathway, activation of IRF5 and IRF7 by MyD88 was not blocked by A52 expression (Fig. 2, c and d), yet these signals were potently blocked by A46 (Fig. 2, e and f). Thus IRAK-2 is unlikely to be a downstream component of TLR-induced IRF3, IRF5, or IRF7 activation. In keeping with this, although IRAK-2 overexpression led to NFκB induction (Fig. 1e), this failed to trigger IRF3 or IRF5 activation in these experiments (Fig. 1, g and h). Similarly, IRF7 was not stimulated by IRAK2 (data not shown). Inhibition of IRAK-2 Suppresses TLR-induced NFκB Activation—We next took a more direct approach to investigate the potential role of IRAK-2 in the TLR-NFκB signaling axis. An IRAK-2-truncated protein (with amino acids 97–590, termed kIRAK-2) has been shown to act as a dominant negative, abolishing the induction of NFκB by the IL-1R (16Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar), and here we also found that kIRAK-2 inhibited ligand-induced TLR3-, TLR4-, and TLR8-mediated NFκB activation, whereas NFκB activation induced through ectopically expressed retinoic acid-inducible gene-I was not blocked (Fig. 3a). Like TLR3, retinoic acid-inducible gene-I is a viral RNA pattern recognition receptor that mediates NFκB activation (28Yoneyama M. Kikuchi M. Natsukawa T. Shinobu N. Imaizumi T. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Akira S. Fujita T. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (3136) Google Scholar). To obtain independent evidence for a role for IRAK-2 in signal transduction from TLR3, TLR4, and TLR8 to NFκB, siRNA gene silencing was used to “knock down” IRAK-2 expression. The efficacy of two IRAK-2 sequence-specific siRNA oligonucleotides was confirmed by showing that IRAK-2 protein expression from a transfected expression vector was completely ablated in the presence of either IRAK-2 siRNA compared with cells treated with a non-silencing control siRNA (Fig. 3b), and that NFκB activation by expression of IRAK-2 was also blocked (Fig. 3c). Crucially, while treatment of cells with the negative control siRNA had no effect on poly(I:C)-, LPS-, or CL075-induced NFκB activity, the siRNA sequences targeting IRAK-2 diminished stimulation of the NFκB reporter gene by these TLR agonists by almost 50% (Fig. 3, d–f). Importantly, the requirement for IRAK-2 in NFκB-dependent TLR4 signaling was confirmed in primary human cells by analyzing the effect of IRAK-2 siRNA on LPS-induced IL-8 cytokine production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Here, negative control siRNA treatment did not alter LPS-induced IL-8 production, whereas IRAK-2 siRNA specifically reduced IL-8 release by almost 40% (Fig. 3g). IRAK-2 Functions Downstream of MyD88 but Upstream of TRIF—We next utilized IRAK-2 siRNA to determine where in TLR signaling cascades to NFκB IRAK-2 functioned. Signaling to NFκB for TLR4 involves the adaptors MyD88, Mal, TRIF, and TRAM, whereas TLR3 uses only TRIF and TLR8 signals solely through MyD88 (29Akira S. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8899) Google Scholar). Hence, the effect of IRAK-2 siRNA on the induction of NFκB by MyD88, Mal, TRIF, and TRAM was investigated. IRAK-2 siRNA clearly inhibited MyD88 signaling to NFκB (Fig. 4a), and in particular IRAK-2B diminished MyD88-induced NFκB activity by almost 50%. NFκB activity induced by Mal was potently blocked in cells treated with both siRNAs (Fig. 4b). These data are consistent with previous proposals of IRAK-2 acting downstream of MyD88 (16Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar) and Mal (3Fitzgerald K.A. Palsson-McDermott E.M. Bowie A.G. Jefferies C.A. Mansell A.S. Brady G. Brint E. Dunne A. Gray P. Harte M.T. McMurray D. Smith D.E. Sims J.E. Bird T.A. O'Neill L.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, although NFκB activation by poly(I:C)/TLR3 was sensitive to IRAK-2 siRNAs (Fig. 3d), no inhibition of TRIF-induced NFκB activation was observed (Fig. 4c). Equally, TRAM, which is upstream of TRIF in the TLR4 pathway, was unaffected (Fig. 4d). These data suggested alternative usage of IRAK-2 in the MyD88- and TRIF-dependent pathways to NFκB activation. The fact that TLR3 signals independently of MyD88 and Mal and solely utilizes TRIF, yet has a requirement for IRAK-2, suggested that IRAK-2 might be recruited into the TLR3 signaling complex upstream of TRIF. IRAK-2 Associates with TLR3—Because IRAK-2 can associate with Mal (3Fitzgerald K.A. Palsson-McDermott E.M. Bowie A.G. Jefferies C.A. Mansell A.S. Brady G. Brint E. Dunne A. Gray P. Harte M.T. McMurray D. Smith D.E. Sims J.E. Bird T.A. O'Neill L.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar) and form a complex with the IL-1R (16Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar), we reasoned that IRAK-2 could interact with TIR domain-containing proteins, in contrast to IRAK-1, which accesses IL-1R·TLR complexes via a death domain interaction with MyD88. We therefore tested whether IRAK-2 could associate with the TLR3 receptor complex. Fig. 4e demonstrates by co-immunoprecipitation an association between ectopically expressed TLR3 and IRAK-2. This complex was detectable in the absence of poly(I:C) treatment, and the intensity of the receptor-IRAK-2 interaction was unchanged following stimulation of TLR3 by poly(I:C). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments carried out with ectopically expressed TLR3 and endogenous IRAK-2 confirmed the ability of IRAK-2 to physically associate with TLR3 (Fig. 4f). Again, the IRAK-2·TLR3 receptor complex was detectable in the absence of poly(I:C) treatment, which may reflect the strength of the association between these two molecules. IRAK-2 Activates NFκB by Stimulating TRAF6 Ubiquination—IRAK-2 can also interact with the non-TIR domain-containing protein TRAF6 (16Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar), which is an important downstream effector molecule for transcription factor and MAP kinase activation by IL-1 and TLRs. Fig. 5a shows a sequence alignment of mammalian IRAK-2 orthologs indicating the position of two putative consensus TRAF6 binding motifs within IRAK-2, as previously noted by Ye et al. (30Ye H. Arron J.R. Lamothe B. Cirilli M. Kobayashi T. Shevde N.K. Segal D. Dzivenu O.K. Vologodskaia M. Yim M. Du K. Singh S. Pike J.W. Darnay B.G. Choi Y. Wu H. Nature. 2002; 418: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). These motifs were mutated to explore the importance of TRAF6 as an effector of IRAK-2 function. The central Glu residues of both sites were mutated concurrently to Ala, because mutation of this residue within the single TRAF6 binding motif of CD40 severely impaired its function (30Ye H. Arron J.R. Lamothe B. Cirilli M. Kobayashi T. Shevde N.K. Segal D. Dzivenu O.K. Vologodskaia M. Yim M. Du K. Singh S. Pike J.W. Darnay B.G. Choi Y. Wu H. Nature. 2002; 418: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Fig. 5b shows that this mutant, IRAK-2DM, was no longer able to activate NFκB (left panel), p38 MAP kinase activation (middle panel), or to induce the IL-8 promoter (right panel). Thus, mutation of the two putative TRAF6 binding motifs within IRAK-2 completely silenced all IRAK-2 functions tested suggesting that TRAF6 is a critical effector for IRAK-2-induced NFκB and MAP kinase activation. The relative contribution of each TRAF6 binding motif to IRAK-2 function was examined by mutating each central Glu independently to generate two distinct mutants, E528A and E559A. IRAK-2E559A induced signal transduction pathways as potently as the wild-type protein (Fig. 5, compare c to b). Surprisingly, IRAK-2E528A was entirely inert, unable to induce NFκB or p38 MAP kinase activation, or to up-regulate the IL-8 promoter (Fig. 5c). Both mutant proteins were expressed at comparable levels (Fig. 5d). Hence a single amino acid (Glu-528), in the first TRAF6 binding motif is essential for IRAK-2 function, whereas the second putative TRAF6 binding motif does not appear to be important for IRAK-2 signaling to NFκB or p38 MAP kinase activation. Because mutation of the central Glu residue within the TRAF6 binding motif of CD40 abolished its ability to interact with TRAF6 in an in vitro binding assay, thus accounting for the ensuing loss of activity (30Ye H. Arron J.R. Lamothe B. Cirilli M. Kobayashi T. Shevde N.K. Segal D. Dzivenu O.K. Vologodskaia M. Yim M. Du K. Singh S. Pike J.W. Darnay B.G. Choi Y. Wu H. Nature. 2002; 418: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), we compared the ability of the mutants to interact with TRAF6. Surprisingly, when IRAK-2E528A was expressed in cells it was still capable of interacting with TRAF6 (Fig. 5d, left panels). As expected, the functionally active IRAK-2E559A also associated with TRAF6 (Fig. 5d, middlepanels). Notably, the IRAK-2DM mutant similarly bound to TRAF6 in co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 5d, right panels) confirming that the association of IRAK-2E528A with TRAF6 was not simply through the Glu-559-containing TRAF6 binding motif. Thus, other essential residues within these motifs are likely sufficient to facilitate binding. TRAF6 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and TRAF6 autoubiquitination is a critical step in the activation of NFκB by TLRs (31Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that expression of wild-type IRAK-2 is sufficient to trigger polyubiquitination of TRAF6. Further, although the IRAK-2 loss-of-function mutants could still interact with TRAF6 they could no longer stimulate TRAF6 polyubiquitination. Fig. 5e shows an ubiquitination assay where conjugation of HA-ubiquitin to endogenous TRAF6 was clearly induced in the presence of IRAK2 (lane 4, upper panel) and similarly by IRAK-2E559A (lane 6), but not by IRAK-2E528A (lane 5) nor IRAK-2DM (lane 7). Thus the ability of the IRAK-2 mutants to activate downstream signaling directly correlated with their ability to stimulate TRAF6 polyubiquitination. The detection of immunoprecipitated TRAF6 was reduced upon triggering of TRAF6 ubiquitination (second panel), likely due to the presence of conjugated ubiquitin blocking antibody recognition of TRAF6 epitopes. Interestingly, immunoprecipitation of TRAF6 was also reduced in the presence of IRAK-2 alone (second panel, lane 3) likely indicating the conjugation of endogenous ubiquitin to TRAF6 when IRAK-2 is introduced into cells. Although it has been assumed that IRAK1 causes TRAF6 polyubiquitination, here comparison of IRAK-2 to IRAK-1 in the ubiquitination assay revealed that IRAK-1 lacked the ability of IRAK-2 to initiate TRAF6 polyubiquitination (compare lane 4 to lane 6; Fig. 5f, upper panel). Critically, given the essential requirement for this key step in the induction of NFκB in response to TLR signal transduction, this functional difference between IRAK-1 and IRAK-2 provides strong evidence for a more central role for IRAK-2 in TLR signaling to NFκB compared with IRAK-1. Although identified 10 years ago (16Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar), the exact role of IRAK-2 in TLR signaling has remained unclear, as has the extent of its involvement in different TLR pathways. Here, we have exploited the ability of the poxvirus protein A52 to inhibit TLR signaling to implicate IRAK-2 as having a central role in NFκB activation. Like other known virulence factors, A52 seems to have multiple effects on the host immune response, and the availability of an A52 mutant, which only interacted with IRAK-2 and not its other target TRAF6, allowed us to map the inhibitory effect of A52 on NFκB to an association with IRAK-2. How exactly A52 disrupts IRAK-2 function remains to be determined, but previous work suggests that it may sequester IRAK-2 out of signaling complexes and prevent it interacting with other signaling molecules (18Harte M.T. Haga I.R. Maloney G. Gray P. Reading P.C. Bartlett N.W. Smith G.L. Bowie A. O'Neill L.A. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Having shown that A52 inhibited NFκB activation induced by TLR2-, -3, -4, -5, -7, -8, and -9, we focused on the TLR3 pathways, because IRAK-1 had been clearly shown to have no role in TLR3-mediated NFκB activation. NFκB activation by poly(I:C)/TLR3 was normal in IRAK-1-deficient cells, and neither IRAK-1 nor IRAK-4 was recruited to the TLR3 receptor complex following ligand engagement (32Jiang Z. Zamanian-Daryoush M. Nie H. Silva A.M. Williams B.R. Li X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16713-16719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In contrast, we showed here that IRAK-2 is part of the unstimulated TLR3 receptor complex (Fig. 4, e and f). Crucially, knockdown of endogenous IRAK-2 expression by siRNA suppressed poly(I: C)/TLR3-mediated NFκB activation (Fig. 3d). Further knockdown experiments showed that, in contrast to MyD88- and Mal-dependent pathways to NFκB, IRAK-2 seems to act upstream of the TRIF-dependent pathway (Fig. 4, a–c), consistent with the interaction of IRAK-2 with TLR3. A model for IRAK2 involvement in TLR signaling pathways to NFκB is shown in Fig. 6. It is currently unclear how exactly TRIF is involved in IRAK-2-mediated NFκB activation by TLR3. Given that, in the absence of TRIF, signaling to NFκB from TLR3 is disrupted (6Hoebe K. Du X. Georgel P. Janssen E. Tabeta K. Kim S.O. Goode J. Lin P. Mann N. Mudd S. Crozat K. Sovath S. Han J. Beutler B. Nature. 2003; 424: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar, 33Yamamoto M. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Sanjo H. Takeuchi O. Sugiyama M. Okabe M. Takeda K. Akira S. Science. 2003; 301: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (2527) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that IRAK-2 controls a dominant TLR3 pathway to NFκB independently of TRIF. However, because these studies utilized knock-out mouse models, it remains to be seen whether TRIF functions identically in TLR3 signaling in humans. Recent studies have questioned the originally proposed central role of IRAK-1 in NFκB activation. For TLR9 in dendritic cells, IRAK-1 was dispensable for NFκB activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production (34Uematsu S. Sato S. Yamamoto M. Hirotani T. Kato H. Takeshita F. Matsuda M. Coban C. Ishii K.J. Kawai T. Takeuchi O. Akira S. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 915-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). TLR9 is thought to signal in a similar manner to TLR8, and herein, we show that IRAK2 siRNA inhibited TLR8-mediated NFκB activation. Further, alternative NFκB-independent functions for IRAK-1 have emerged, such as TLR4-mediated STAT3 activation and upregulation of the NFκB-independent gene, IL-10 (35Huang Y. Li T. Sane D.C. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51697-51703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In that study, absence of IRAK-1 had no effect on LPS induction of the NFκB-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL1-β. In our study, IRAK-2 siRNA inhibited LPS-induced NFκB activation, and, in primary human cells, LPS stimulated production of the NFκB-dependent chemokine IL-8. Moreover, IRF7 has recently been identified as a target of IRAK-1 kinase activity (34Uematsu S. Sato S. Yamamoto M. Hirotani T. Kato H. Takeshita F. Matsuda M. Coban C. Ishii K.J. Kawai T. Takeuchi O. Akira S. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 915-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The formation of an IRF7·IRAK-1 complex followed by IRAK-1-mediated phosphorylation of IRF7 appeared to be a prerequisite for interferon-α induction by TLR7 and TLR9. In contrast, the lack of any effect of A52 or IRAK2 expression on IRF3, -5, and -7 activation suggests that IRAK-2 has no role in IRF activation. Hence IRAK-1, although involved in some pathways to NFκB, may be more fundamentally important for TLR signaling to IRFs. Here, the observation that IRAK-2 but not IRAK-1 could trigger TRAF6 ubiquitination provides direct evidence for the importance of IRAK-2 over IRAK-1 in TLR-mediated NFκB activation, because the autoubiquitinating E3 ligase activity of TRAF6 is essential for IL-1R/TLR signaling to NFκB (36Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar, 37Chen H. Wu Y. Zhang Y. Jin L. Luo L. Xue B. Lu C. Zhang X. Yin Z. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 3145-3152Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), although how exactly this activity of TRAF6 is turned on by IRAK-2 is yet to be established. Although it had been assumed that IRAK-1 could stimulate TRAF6 ubiquitination, a recent study demonstrated that the Epstein-Barr virus protein LMP1 could cause TRAF6 polyubiquitination in the absence of IRAK-1 (38Song Y.J. Jen K.Y. Soni V. Kieff E. Cahir-McFarland E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2689-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus we have defined a dichotomy in IRAK-1 and IRAK-2 function, which suggests that these proteins are not simply functionally redundant but rather fulfill separate roles in TLR signaling. Despite two potential TRAF6-binding motifs being previously identified in IRAK-2 (30Ye H. Arron J.R. Lamothe B. Cirilli M. Kobayashi T. Shevde N.K. Segal D. Dzivenu O.K. Vologodskaia M. Yim M. Du K. Singh S. Pike J.W. Darnay B.G. Choi Y. Wu H. Nature. 2002; 418: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), their functional significance had not been tested until now. The site containing Glu-528 is conserved among mammalian IRAK-2 orthologs, whereas the second putative TRAF6 binding site containing residue Glu-559 is not, consistent with the functional relevance of the Glu-528-containing site, which when mutated abolished the ability of IRAK-2 expression to induce NFκB and MAP kinase activation and IL-8 promoter induction. The fact that IRAK-2E528A still binds to TRAF6 and yet cannot activate NFκB suggests that Glu-528 is in fact critical for signal transduction, and consistent with this, IRAK-2E528A no longer induced TRAF6 polyubiquitination. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that IRAK-2 has a central role in TLR signaling pathways to NFκB activation, and in contrast to IRAK-1, is likely utilized by all TLRs for this purpose. IRAK-2 can interact with at least one TLR, namely TLR3, and TRAF6 is a critical downstream mediator of IRAK-2 function. Given that IRAK-2 is unlikely to be involved in IRF activation, selectively targeting IRAK-2 may be a useful therapeutic strategy to block pro-inflammatory TLR signals via NFκB, while preserving IRF-regulated pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2027077811,"Background The potential medical applications of nanomaterials are shaping the landscape of the nanobiotechnology field and driving it forward. A key factor in determining the suitability of these nanomaterials must be how they interface with biological systems. Single walled carbon nanotubes (CNT) are being investigated as platforms for the delivery of biological, radiological, and chemical payloads to target tissues. CNT are mechanically robust graphene cylinders comprised of sp2-bonded carbon atoms and possessing highly regular structures with defined periodicity. CNT exhibit unique mechanochemical properties that can be exploited for the development of novel drug delivery platforms. In order to evaluate the potential usefulness of this CNT scaffold, we undertook an imaging study to determine the tissue biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of prototypical DOTA-functionalized CNT labeled with yttrium-86 and indium-111 (86Y-CNT and 111In-CNT, respectively) in a mouse model. Methodology and Principal Findings The 86Y-CNT construct was synthesized from amine-functionalized, water-soluble CNT by covalently attaching multiple copies of DOTA chelates and then radiolabeling with the positron-emitting metal-ion, yttrium-86. A gamma-emitting 111In-CNT construct was similarly prepared and purified. The constructs were characterized spectroscopically, microscopically, and chromatographically. The whole-body distribution and clearance of yttrium-86 was characterized at 3 and 24 hours post-injection using positron emission tomography (PET). The yttrium-86 cleared the blood within 3 hours and distributed predominantly to the kidneys, liver, spleen and bone. Although the activity that accumulated in the kidney cleared with time, the whole-body clearance was slow. Differential uptake in these target tissues was observed following intraveneous or intraperitoneal injection. Conclusions The whole-body PET images indicated that the major sites of accumulation of activity resulting from the administration of 86Y-CNT were the kidney, liver, spleen, and to a much less extent the bone. Blood clearance was rapid and could be beneficial in the use of short-lived radionuclides in diagnostic applications."
https://openalex.org/W2159263888,"The potential impact of pre-exposure chemoprophylaxis (PrEP) on heterosexual transmission of HIV-1 infection in resource-limited settings is uncertain.A deterministic mathematical model was used to simulate the effects of antiretroviral PrEP on an HIV-1 epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa under different scenarios (optimistic, neutral and pessimistic) both with and without sexual disinhibition. Sensitivity analyses were used to evaluate the effect of uncertainty in input parameters on model output and included calculation of partial rank correlations and standardized rank regressions. In the scenario without sexual disinhibition after PrEP initiation, key parameters influencing infections prevented were effectiveness of PrEP (partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) = 0.94), PrEP discontinuation rate (PRCC = -0.94), level of coverage (PRCC = 0.92), and time to achieve target coverage (PRCC = -0.82). In the scenario with sexual disinhibition, PrEP effectiveness and the extent of sexual disinhibition had the greatest impact on prevention. An optimistic scenario of PrEP with 90% effectiveness and 75% coverage of the general population predicted a 74% decline in cumulative HIV-1 infections after 10 years, and a 28.8% decline with PrEP targeted to the highest risk groups (16% of the population). Even with a 100% increase in at-risk behavior from sexual disinhibition, a beneficial effect (23.4%-62.7% decrease in infections) was seen with 90% effective PrEP across a broad range of coverage (25%-75%). Similar disinhibition led to a rise in infections with lower effectiveness of PrEP (< or = 50%).Mathematical modeling supports the potential public health benefit of PrEP. Approximately 2.7 to 3.2 million new HIV-1 infections could be averted in southern sub-Saharan Africa over 10 years by targeting PrEP (having 90% effectiveness) to those at highest behavioral risk and by preventing sexual disinhibition. This benefit could be lost, however, by sexual disinhibition and by high PrEP discontinuation, especially with lower PrEP effectiveness (< or = 50%)."
https://openalex.org/W2028185267,"Transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs) are auxiliary AMPA receptor subunits that regulate both the trafficking and gating properties of AMPA receptors, and different TARP isoforms display distinct expression patterns in brain. Here, we compared the effects of four TARP isoforms on the kinetics of AMPA receptor currents. Each isoform slowed the deactivation of GluR1 currents, but the slowing was greatest with gamma-4 and gamma-8. Isoform-specific differences in desensitization were also observed that correlated with effects on deactivation. TARP isoforms also differentially modulated responses to trains of glutamate applications designed to mimic high-frequency presynaptic firing. Importantly, whereas both stargazin and gamma-4 rescued excitatory synaptic transmission in cerebellar granule cells from stargazer mice, the decay of miniature EPSCs was 2-fold slower in neurons expressing gamma-4. The results show that heterogeneity in the composition of AMPA receptor/TARP complexes contributes to synapse-specific differences in EPSC decays and frequency-dependent modulation of neurotransmission."
https://openalex.org/W1978603749,"Functional diversity has been postulated to be critical for the maintenance of ecosystem functioning, but the way it can be disrupted by human-related disturbances remains poorly investigated. Here we test the hypothesis that habitat fragmentation changes the relative contribution of tree species within categories of reproductive traits (frequency of traits) and reduces the functional diversity of tree assemblages. The study was carried out in an old and severely fragmented landscape of the Brazilian Atlantic forest. We used published information and field observations to obtain the frequency of tree species and individuals within 50 categories of reproductive traits (distributed in four major classes: pollination systems, floral biology, sexual systems, and reproductive systems) in 10 fragments and 10 tracts of forest interior (control plots). As hypothesized, populations in fragments and control plots differed substantially in the representation of the four major classes of reproductive traits (more than 50% of the categories investigated). The most conspicuous differences were the lack of three pollination systems in fragments--pollination by birds, flies and non-flying mammals--and that fragments had a higher frequency of both species and individuals pollinated by generalist vectors. Hermaphroditic species predominate in both habitats, although their relative abundances were higher in fragments. On the contrary, self-incompatible species were underrepresented in fragments. Moreover, fragments showed lower functional diversity (H' scores) for pollination systems (-30.3%), floral types (-23.6%), and floral sizes (-20.8%) in comparison to control plots. In contrast to the overwhelming effect of fragmentation, patch and landscape metrics such as patch size and forest cover played a minor role on the frequency of traits. Our results suggest that habitat fragmentation promotes a marked shift in the relative abundance of tree reproductive traits and greatly reduces the functional diversity of tree assemblages in fragmented landscapes."
https://openalex.org/W2068344177,"The past few years have seen a vast increase in the amount of genomic data available for a growing number of taxa, including sets of full length cDNA clones and cis-regulatory sequences. Large scale cross-species comparisons of protein function and cis-regulatory sequences may help to understand the emergence of specific traits during evolution.To facilitate such comparisons, we developed a Gateway compatible vector set, which can be used to systematically dissect cis-regulatory sequences, and overexpress wild type or tagged proteins in a variety of chordate systems. It was developed and first characterised in the embryos of the ascidian Ciona intestinalis, in which large scale analyses are easier to perform than in vertebrates, owing to the very efficient embryo electroporation protocol available in this organism. Its use was then extended to fish embryos and cultured mammalian cells.This versatile vector set opens the way to the mid- to large-scale comparative analyses of protein function and cis-regulatory sequences across chordate evolution.

ADNP immunore-activity was shown to localize to the astrocyte nucleus as well as to the cytoplasm and to the extracellular space, where the protein enhances neuronal survival (3Furman S.

Further studies suggested very high gene conservation in mammals including humans, increased expression in malignant cells, and close association with cellular survival (5Zamostiano R. Pinhasov A.

In the mature brain, ADNP expression was modulated by injury, suggesting a potential protective effect for the protein in vivo (6Gozes I. Zaltzman R. Hauser J. Brenneman D.E. Shohami E. Hill J.M.

Additionally, ADNP expression shows sexual dichotomy and is modulated during the estrous cycle in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (8Furman S. Hill J.M. Vulih I. Zaltzman R. Hauser J.M. Brenneman D.E. Gozes I. Neurosci. Lett. 2005; 373: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and in the vagina (9Gozes I. Morimoto B.H. Tiong J. Fox A. Sutherland K. Dangoor D.

CNS Drug Rev. 2005; 11: 353-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), suggesting a potential neurotrophic/plasticity-associated effect for the protein. Importantly, complete deficiency in ADNP results in neural tube closure defects and death at gestation day 9 in mice (10Pinhasov A. Mandel S. Torchinsky A. Giladi E. Pittel Z. Goldsweig A.M. Servoss S.J. Brenneman D.E. Gozes I. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2003; 144: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). ADNP-deficient embryos exhibit dramatic increases in gene transcripts associated with lipid metabolism coupled to a reduction in organogenesis/neurogenesis related transcripts (11Mandel S. Rechavi G. Gozes I. Dev. Biol. 2007; 303: 814-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In pluripotent P19 cells, ADNP was shown to interact with specific chromatin regions in the neuro-differentiated state, which was associated with binding to heterochromatin protein 1 (11Mandel S. Rechavi G. Gozes I. Dev. Biol. 2007; 303: 814-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To further understand ADNP function, the HEK293 human embryonic kidney cell line that allows efficient transfection with recombinant DNA was used as a model for the identification of ADNP-interacting proteins and cellular function, suggesting that ADNP interacts with several major proteins of the essential SWI/SNF (mating type switching/sucrose nonfermenting) chromatin remodeling complex. HEK293 Cell Culture and Transfection with Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)-ADNP—Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2. HEK293 cells were transfected using the transfection reagent Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with a pEGFP-C1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) expression vector carrying the human ADNP gene transcript. The ADNP construct (named 2S) contained the full-length ADNP transcript without the first and second untranslated exons (NCBI accession code NM_015339) (5Zamostiano R. Pinhasov A. Gelber E. Steingart R.A. Seroussi E. Giladi E. Bassan M. Wollman Y. Eyre H.J. Mulley J.C. Brenneman D.E. Gozes I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 708-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Selection for transfected cells was achieved using G418 neomycin antibiotics (Roche Applied Science) as the plasmid contained a neomycin resistance epitope. Monoclonal Stable Cell Line Formation—A monoclonal stable cell line was established by dilution of transfected cells. Under G418 antibiotic selection, individual colonies grew from individual cells. The cells assimilated the GFP-ADNP construct into their genome by non-homologous recombination, and two stable cell lines were formed, a GFP-ADNP stable cell line HEK293-2S and a control stable cell line HEK293-5S containing GFP with a 20-kDa ADNP N-terminal fragment that resulted from non-homologous recombination and was identified by Western blot analysis (see below). Controls for Specificity—The recombinant ADNP is a fused protein containing an additional 28-kDa protein fragment that constitutes a functional GFP tag. Thus, the discrimination between endogenous and recombinant ADNP relies on both size differences as well as on antibody specificity with GFP antibodies recognizing only the recombinant protein. Three sets of antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation experiments; 1) GFP antibodies recognizing the fused GFP-ADNP, 2) antibodies against ADNP, recognizing both endogenous and recombinant ADNP, which can be differentiated by size, and 3) nonspecific preimmune serum verifying specificity. As an additional control, a truncated recombinant GFP-ADNP including only the 20-kDa-terminal portion of ADNP (5S, described above) was used to ascertain specific binding to ADNP. ADNP, BRG1 Co-immunoprecipitation—Nuclear proteins were extracted from HEK293-2S GFP-ADNP transfected stable cell line and from a control stable cell line HEK293-5S. Protein extraction was performed using Pierce NE-PER nuclear extraction buffer (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol and supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). 300 μg of nuclear proteins were used for ADNP/BRG1 immunoprecipitation using anti-ADNP (BD Biosciences), anti-BRG1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Delaware, CA), anti-GFP beads (MBL International, Woburn, MA), or nonspecific rabbit IgG antibodies (Sigma). 2 μg of each of the antibodies or 30 μl of the anti-GFP beads were added to the nuclear extracts, and the sample was rotated overnight at 4 °C in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxychloric acid) with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). For the ADNP precipitation pre-cleared slurry (30 min of rotation with beads at 4 °C before antibody addition) was supplemented with protein A/G Plus-agarose beads (30 μl; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The protein sample was then subjected to centrifugation at 2000 × g for 30 s to pellet the beads, and the supernatant was removed. The beads were then washed four times with wash buffer (radioimmune precipitation binding buffer, as above) followed by a wash with phosphate-buffered saline. SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the beads, and the proteins were boiled for 5 min. Proteins were separated by a gradient SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis (NuPAGE, Invitrogen) as described below. Western Analysis—SDS-PAGE for GFP-ADNP, ADNP, and BRG1 was performed essentially as described (5Zamostiano R. Pinhasov A. Gelber E. Steingart R.A. Seroussi E. Giladi E. Bassan M. Wollman Y. Eyre H.J. Mulley J.C. Brenneman D.E. Gozes I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 708-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In brief, proteins were separated by electrophoresis on a 4-12% (w/v) gradient NuPAGE Mops gel (Invitrogen). Molecular weights were determined using Wide Range (6-250 kDa) Multicolored Protein Markers (see Blue, Invitrogen). The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), and nonspecific antigen sites were blocked using a solution containing 5% nonfat dried milk (w/v) in 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20. Antigen detection was performed using anti Bethyl-ADNP 1:2,000 (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX) or anti-BRG1 (1:200). Antibody-antigen complexes were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit 1:25,000 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) and visualized by ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Staining and Protein Sequencing—Staining of the protein gel was performed using “SeeBand Forte” following the manufacturer's guidelines (GeBA, Kfar Hanagid, Israel). The bands of interest were cut from the gel, digested by trypsin, analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) on DECA/LCQ, and identified by Pep-Miner and Sequest software against a non-redundant data base of human, mouse, rat, bovine, and rabbit. A peptide was considered high quality if its Pep-Miner identification score was greater than 80 and the Sequest Xcore was 1.5 for single-charged peptides, 2.5 for double-charged peptides, and 3 for triple-charged peptides. Short Hairpin RNAs (shRNA) Constructs and Transfection—ADNP shRNA (Sigma) clones were used for ADNP silencing in HEK293 cells. Three hairpin forming fragments were used in a pLKO.1<-puro vector: SH1, CCGGGCCCGAGAAGAGAGTAGTATTCTCGAGAATACTACTCTCTTCTCGGGCTTTTT; SH3, CCGGGCCATGATTGGGCACACAAATCTCGAGATTTGTGTGCCCAATCATGGCTTTTT, SH5, CCGGCGCACTTACGAGCAAATGGAACTCGAGTTCCATTTGCTCGTAAGTGCGTTTTT. The control shRNA vector contained a nonspecific sequence that does not have a match in the human genome (GFP fragment): GATCCCCGGAGCGCACCATCTTCTTCTTCAAGAGAGAAGAAGATGGTGCGCTCCTTTTTGGAAA. Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen), and cells were selected for positive transfection with 2-5 μg/ml puromycin (in accordance with the manufacturer instructions (Sigma). ADNP reduction was shown both by quantitative real time PCR analysis (described below) as well as by Western analysis as described above. To control for nonspecific effects by puromycin, GFP shRNA was used side by side with different ADNP shRNA species, and cells transfected with GFP shRNA (controls) were also treated with puromycin. RNA Extraction and Quantitative Real Time PCR Assay—Total RNA was extracted from ADNP shRNA-transfected and shRNA control HEK293 cells. RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). ADNP RNA expression levels were determined using specific primers for ADNP (sense, 5′-ACTTACGAAAAACCAGGACTATC-3′; antisense-5′-GACATTGCGGAAATGATC-3′). HPRT control primers were 5′-TATGGACAGGACTGAACGTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-ATCCAGCAGGTCAGCAAA-3′ (antisense). After being treated by DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX), 0.2 μg of RNA/sample was reverse-transcribed by SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (200 units, Invitrogen) using random hexamer primers (10 min at 25 °C, 50 min at 50 °C, 5 min at 85 °C). Real time reverse transcription-PCR was performed using the SYBER GREEN PCR Master mix and ABI PRISM 7900 Sequence Detection System instrument and software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal C-terminal-ADNP (BL1034) antibodies were obtained from Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX), and mouse monoclonal tubulin antibodies (TUB2.5) were used as before (12Gozes I. Barnstable C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2579-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Rabbit BRG1 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-GFP covalently conjugated to agarose beads was from MBL International (Woburn, MA). Other antibodies included mouse monoclonal anti-C-terminal-ADNP (BD Biosciences) and nonspecific IgG from rabbit serum (Sigma). Secondary antibodies were goat anti-mouse-HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and goat anti-rabbit-HRP (Sigma). Immunocytochemistry and Confocal Microscopy—HEK293 cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde. Immunostaining was performed as follows. Triton X-100 (0.2%) was added for 5 min at room temperature. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline followed by washing with 2% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, nonspecific antibody binding was blocked using 50 μg/ml goat IgG (Sigma). The cells were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the primary mouse monoclonal ADNP antibody (1:60), rabbit BRG1 polyclonal antibodies (1:200), or tubulin mouse monoclonal antibodies, TUB2.5 (1:20), followed by a 30-min incubation with affinity-purified Cy3-labeled secondary goat-anti-mouse IgG (1:200) or Cy2 goat anti rabbit IgG (1:300). Slides were then washed twice (5 min/wash) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100, stained for DNA with Hoechst 33258 at 2 mg/ml, and mounted. Fluorescently stained cells were analyzed using the Zeiss confocal laser-scanning microscope. Zeiss LSM 410 inverted microscope (Oberkochen) equipped with a 25-milliwatt krypton-argon laser (488- and 568-nm maximum lines). A 40 × 1.2-watt Apochromat water immersion lens (Axiovert 135M; Zeiss) was used for all imaging. Metabolic Activity Measurements—Metabolic activity of shRNA-transfected HEK293 viable cells was measured by the Cell-Titer 96 kit in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). The assay uses a colorimetric method employing a tetrazolium compound (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H tetrazolium, (MTS)) and electron-coupling reagent phenazine methasulfate. MTS is bio-reduced by the living cells to the formazan form that is detected at 490 nm. GFP-ADNP Stable Cell Line Formation—ADNP is known to localize mostly to the nucleus and in some cases to the cell cytoplasm (3Furman S. Steingart R.A. Mandel S. Hauser J.M. Brenneman D.E. Gozes I. Neuron Glia Biol. 2004; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To trace ADNP in the cell and to broaden our understanding regarding its mechanism of action, GFP was attached to ADNP to form a GFP-ADNP chimeric protein. The construct was formed and used to transfect HEK293 human kidney cell line. The cells with the attained construct resistance to G418 neomycin antibiotics were diluted and grown separately to form monoclonal GFP-ADNP overexpressing colonies (Fig. 1). This model enabled real time detection of ADNP localization in the cell as well as precipitation of the protein from its N-terminal GFP tag in addition to ADNP antibodies against the ADNP C-terminal domain. The GFP-ADNP protein showed the expected increase of 27 kDa in its molecular mass compared with endogenous ADNP due to the N-terminal GFP addition (Fig. 1A) and also showed distinct localization to the nuclei (Fig. 1B). ADNP Co-precipitates with the SWI/SNF Complex through ADNP C-terminal Interaction—Immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments of GFP-ADNP were performed using two antibodies, anti-GFP and anti-C-terminal ADNP. Anti-GFP co-immunoprecipitated GFP-ADNP with other proteins (Fig. 2A, lane 1). Control IP of a GFP 20-kDa N-terminal-truncated ADNP chimera (see the “Experimental Procedures”) was performed (Fig. 2A, lane 2) to indicate that the interaction with other proteins was neither with the GFP region nor with the N-terminal ADNP region of the chimeric GFP-ADNP. A second IP assay was preformed using C-terminal ADNP antibody that recognize a 136-amino acid region on the ADNP C terminus (Fig. 2A, lane 3). The C-terminal ADNP antibody precipitated both endogenous ADNP (150 kDa) and chimeric GFP-ADNP (∼180 kDa). However, no proteins co-precipitated with ADNP when using this antibody. Protein-A/G beads were used as a nonspecific control (Fig. 2A, lane 4). Four bands obtained by the anti-GFP antibody co-IP (Fig. 2A, lane 1, arrows) were analyzed using trypsin digestion and LC-MS. Results of the protein analysis showed that of the four bands, one belonged to the GFP-ADNP chimeric protein (∼180 kDa) and the other three to components of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex: BAF170, BRG1, and BAF250a (13Simone C. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 207: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, A and B). This result indicates interaction between ADNP and the SWI/SNF complex through the ADNP C-terminal region. When precipitated with anti-C-terminal ADNP, both endogenous ADNP and GFP-ADNP precipitated, but the interaction with the SWI/SNF proteins was abolished (Fig. 2A). Validation of Co-immunoprecipitation Results—To validate the LC-MS results, Western analysis was performed on the immunoprecipitated proteins from nuclear extracts of GFP-ADNP HEK293 stable cells (2S, see “Experimental Procedures”) and control GFP-truncated ADNP cells (5S, see “Experimental Procedures”) using anti-GFP and anti-C-terminal ADNP (Fig. 2, C and D). Results showed that GFP-ADNP (Fig. 2C, lane 1, left membrane) precipitated with anti-GFP and that mostly endogenous ADNP as well as GFP-ADNP was precipitated with anti C-terminal ADNP (Fig. 2C, lane 3, left membrane). BRG1 was selected as a SWI/SNF representative component, and its presence was validated using Western analysis on the same IP results (Fig. 2C, lane 1, right membrane). These results also showed that co-precipitation with BRG1 was eliminated when precipitation was performed with C-terminal ADNP antibodies (Fig. 2C, lane 3, right membrane). This reinforces the fact that ADNP and SWI/SNF complex-related proteins interact through the ADNP C-terminal region. Interaction between BRG1 and Endogenous ADNP—IP with anti-BRG1 was performed to reinforce the ADNP/BRG1 interaction results and to show that not only recombinant GFP-ADNP is involved in this interaction but also endogenous ADNP. HEK293 nuclear extract was used for anti-BRG1 IP. Nonspecific rabbit serum was used as control antibody. Results showed that endogenous ADNP (Fig. 2D, lane 2, right membrane) precipitates with BRG1 (Fig. 2D, lane 5, right membrane). In particular, BRG1 was shown here to co-precipitate with full-length GFP-ADNP (2S) (Fig. 2D, lane 1, left membrane) and not with the truncated GFP-ADNP control (5S) when GFP antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2D, lane 2, left membrane). Nuclear extract (without immunoprecipitation) showed detectable levels of endogenous BRG1. On the right membrane (Fig. 2D) we show immunoprecipitation with BRG1 antibodies and detection with ADNP antibodies (lanes 1-3) and BRG1 antibodies to validate the above results (lanes 4 and 5). To further substantiate the interaction between ADNP and BRG1 at the cellular level, we have performed triple cellular staining. Results in blue (Fig. 2E) indicate Hoechst nuclear staining, in red indicate ADNP staining, and in green indicate BRG1 staining. Yellow indicates co-localization of BRG1 and ADNP immunostaining (Fig. 2E). Double-immunohistochemistry of ADNP and BRG1 in HEK293 cells showed similar patterns of nuclear staining, reinforcing co-localization and interaction of both proteins. shRNA ADNP Down-regulation Affects Cell Viability and Causes Morphological Changes—A cellular system for ADNP knock-down was established. Transient knock-down of the proteins was obtained by transfecting HEK293 cells with retroviral vectors expressing two different ADNP shRNAs under puromycin selection (SH1 and SH3 are defined under “Experimental Procedures”). The two shRNA constructs showed efficient reduction of the levels of ADNP RNA and protein as confirmed by using both quantitative real time PCR (Fig. 3A) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 3B). A control for the experiment was cells transfected with a vector carrying shRNA against GFP, which has no significant homology to any human gene. Cells transfected with the control shRNA were also treated with puromycin and served as a control also for puromycin treatment. All shRNA transfections were performed in cells that express only endogenous ADNP. The down-regulation of ADNP had a significant effect on cell morphology, which progressed with time in culture. 72 h after transfection with the shRNA constructs and 48 h after puromycin selection, the cells exhibited differences in number and shape. ADNP-deficient abnormal cells showed undefined edges, a round shape, and lack of extensions as compared with cells transfected with the control shRNA vector (Fig. 4, A versus B). A significant increase (more than 60%) in abnormally shaped cells was found in ADNP down-regulated cells (Fig. 4C, left graph). Also, the number of surface-attached cells was significantly reduced (∼50%) in the ADNP down-regulated cells (Fig. 4C, right graph). Cell counting results were corroborated using MTS metabolic activity measurements, indicating a significant ∼15% decrease in cell viability in the SH3 ADNP shRNA-treated cells in comparison to the GFP shRNA-treated cells (Fig. 4D). These results indicate that the lower cell density measured in the SH3-treated cells (Fig. 4C) was associated at least in part with decreased metabolic activity. Changes in cell shape and the ADNP potential downstream mechanisms were addressed using monoclonal anti-tubulin antibodies and triple immunofluorescence staining as follows. Fig. 5A shows nuclear localization for ADNP (green) together with Hoechst staining (blue). Tubulin staining was dispersed in the cytoplasm (red) of the control shRNA-transfected cells. In contrast, ADNP shRNA treatment (SH3) resulted in almost complete disappearance of ADNP immunostaining (attesting to the specificity of the antibody) coupled to microtubule “shrinkage” and changes of cellular condensation and shape (Fig. 5B). Fig. 5C shows that the degree of cell shape changes may depend on the degree of the reduction in ADNP as follows. A 50% reduction in ADNP expression resulted in a similar morphology to control cells, whereas an 80% reduction in ADNP was correlated with distinct morphological changes. The current study shows for the first time interaction between ADNP and three members of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex: BAF250a, BRG1, and BAF170. Furthermore, this paper shows that ADNP expression is associated with cell shape determination. Mammalian SWI/SNF is a multiprotein chromatin-remodeling complex that is composed of at least 10 elements. Two distinct SWI/SNF complexes were described, each characterized by the presence of a unique subunit, either BAF250 or BAF180, defined as BAF and PBAF, respectively. In addition, BAF can contain either BRG1 or BRM as the core motor subunit, whereas PBAF only contains BRG1 (13Simone C. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 207: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Here, ADNP precipitated with the BAF250a subunit as well as with the BRG1 subunit, suggesting that ADNP associates with the BAF complex containing the BRG1 core motor subunit. To ascertain specificity for the ADNP BRG1 interaction and given that the endogenous expression of ADNP in HEK293 is high, we have taken the following measures. 1) We have performed repeated immunoprecipitation experiments using antibodies against the GFP portion of the recombinant ADNP fused to GFP resulting in BRG1 co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2, A-D). The recombinant ADNP is a fused protein containing an additional 28-kDa protein fragment constituting a functional GFP tag. Thus, the discrimination between endogenous and recombinant ADNP relies on both size differences as well as on antibody specificity with GFP antibodies recognizing only the recombinant protein. 2) Antibodies against the endogenous ADNP C terminus, although precipitating endogenous ADNP, did not co-precipitate BRG1, suggesting that a free ADNP C terminus is required for interaction with BRG1 (Fig. 2C). 3) Precipitation with BRG1 antibodies showed co-precipitation with endogenous ADNP (Fig. 2D). 4) Nonspecific serum precipitation verified specificity (Fig. 2D, - indicates control non-specific serum). 5) We have also performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments with truncated ADNP fused to GFP, including only the 20-kDa N-terminal portion of ADNP (5S, described above) to ascertain specific binding to ADNP, showing that the full-length ADNP is required for BRG1 interaction and co-immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, we performed triple-labeling experiments with Hoechst nuclear staining, ADNP and BRG1 showing co-localization at the nuclear level (Fig. 2E). Previously, complete ADNP deficiency was shown to block neurogenesis in the mouse embryo (10Pinhasov A. Mandel S. Torchinsky A. Giladi E. Pittel Z. Goldsweig A.M. Servoss S.J. Brenneman D.E. Gozes I. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2003; 144: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) in parallel with specific inhibition of Neurogenin1 and Neurod1 (11Mandel S. Rechavi G. Gozes I. Dev. Biol. 2007; 303: 814-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) (genes that are associated with neuronal fate determination (14Bertrand N. Castro D.S. Guillemot F. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar)). In addition, ADNP was shown to be associated with neuronal maturation through differential interaction with chromatin in the pluripotent p19 cells that were differentiated into neuronal/glial phenotype (11Mandel S. Rechavi G. Gozes I. Dev. Biol. 2007; 303: 814-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These previous results correlate well with the fact that BRG1 (and by inference the SWI/SNF complex) is an essential regulator of neuronal differentiation during vertebrate nervous system formation (15Eroglu B. Wang G. Tu N. Sun X. Mivechi N.F. Dev. Dyn. 2006; 235: 2722-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) with direct interaction with Neurogenin1 and Neurod (16Seo S. Richardson G.A. Kroll K.L. Development. 2005; 132: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). ADNP was also associated with repression of lipid transport and metabolism-related genes (11Mandel S. Rechavi G. Gozes I. Dev. Biol. 2007; 303: 814-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This functional group of genes was significantly up-regulated in the ADNP knock-out embryos. Promoter analysis of this group of genes revealed a significant enrichment in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) transcription factor binding site, indicating ADNP/PPARγ co-regulatory properties (11Mandel S. Rechavi G. Gozes I. Dev. Biol. 2007; 303: 814-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Intact SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes are essential for the activation of adipogenic genes as well as for the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) (17Salma N. Xiao H. Mueller E. Imbalzano A.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4651-4663Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) reinforcing and explaining the ADNP/PPARγ effect on embryonic lipid transport and metabolism. SWI/SNF is a multiprotein complex able to remodel chromatin toward cellular and environmental requirements. In addition to its transcriptional activator functions, it was described also as a transcription repressive element in concert with the SUV39H1/HP1 complex (18Nielsen S.J. Schneider R. Bauer U.M. Bannister A.J. Morrison A. O'Carroll D. Firestein R. Cleary M. Jenuwein T. Herrera R.E. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2001; 412: 561-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 19Siddiqui H. Fox S.R. Gunawardena R.W. Knudsen E.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 2007; 211: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). An interaction between ADNP and HP1α through the ADNP conserved PXVXL HP1α biding motif (11Mandel S. Rechavi G. Gozes I. Dev. Biol. 2007; 303: 814-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) may explain some of the SWI/SNF-HP1α repressive association. Down-regulation of ADNP by shRNA resulted in morphological changes that are in line with the fact that ADNP contains a homeodomain profile (2Bassan M. Zamostiano R. Davidson A. Pinhasov A. Giladi E. Perl O. Bassan H. Blat C. Gibney G. Glazner G. Brenneman D.E. Gozes I. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1283-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) and with the SWI/SNF complex function that is associated with cellular differentiation. Indeed, previous studies have shown that BRG1 loss induces an altered cellular morphology and disruption in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton (20Rosson G.B. Bartlett C. Reed W. Weissman B.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 2005; 205: 286-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and mutations in the SWI/SNF complex resulted in changes in cell size and attachment area (21Hill D.A. Chiosea S. Jamaluddin S. Roy K. Fischer A.H. Boyd D.D. Nickerson J.A. Imbalzano A.N. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5847-5854Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that ADNP functionality plays a role in these changes. In addition, in the current studies, changes in cell morphology as a result of decreased ADNP expression may have further led to cellular death and detachment from the cell culture plate. Cell counting as well as metabolic activity measurements indicated a 15-50% decrease in cell viability in the SH3 ADNP shRNA-treated cells in comparison to the GFP shRNA-treated cells. Previous results have indicated that ADNP down-regulation in cancer cell lines result in cell death that was associated with an increase in the expression of the proapoptotic protein p53 (5Zamostiano R. Pinhasov A. Gelber E. Steingart R.A. Seroussi E. Giladi E. Bassan M. Wollman Y. Eyre H.J. Mulley J.C. Brenneman D.E. Gozes I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 708-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In line with this finding, the addition of recombinant ADNP to pheochromocytoma cells under severe oxidative stress resulted in increased cellular survival coupled to decreases in p53 (4Steingart R.A. Gozes I. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2006; 252: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). ADNP may be involved in the p53 pathway by mediating the recruitment of SWI/SNF to the chromatin of genes implicated in growth suppression and apoptosis in response to several cell stress-dependent pathways (22Lee D. Kim J.W. Seo T. Hwang S.G. Choi E.J. Choe J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22330-22337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Other studies have suggested shuttling for ADNP between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, where ADNP-like immunoreactivity may interact with the microtubule cytoskeleton (3Furman S. Steingart R.A. Mandel S. Hauser J.M. Brenneman D.E. Gozes I. Neuron Glia Biol. 2004; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) that is associated with determination of cellular structure in combination with other cytoskeletal elements, including actin micro-filaments and intermediate filaments (23Gozes I. Littauer U.Z. Geiger B. Fuchs S. FEBS Lett. 1977; 73: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Here, microtubule reorganization paralleled changes in cellular morphology. Interestingly, BAF53, an actin-related protein that also shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm, constitutes an integral component of many chromatin-modifying complexes including SWI/SNF as well as TIP60, TRRAP, and TIP48/49. Furthermore, recent studies have associated BAF53 with p53-dependent transcription (24Roy S. Zhang B. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Acta Neuropathol (Berl.). 2005; 109: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). shRNA constructs were used to target endogenous ADNP and as control a GFP shRNA was used. From our shRNA experiments it was apparent that the amount of ADNP in the cell is important for cell morphology and survival. Indeed, when we partially reduced ADNP mRNA by 50%, (SH5, Fig. 5C), we did not see the obvious changes in cell morphology observed with 80% (SH3) ADNP mRNA reduction (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, our in vivo data suggest that complete knock-out of ADNP is lethal, whereas the ADNP heterozygous mice survive but show multiple deficits (25Vulih-Shultzman I. Pinhasov A. Mandel S. Grigoriadis N. Touloumi O. Pittel Z. Gozes I. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, partial reduction in ADNP expression in vivo in ADNP+/- mice results in multiple changes in gene expression, decreased cellular activity, and a tauopathy-like phenotype (25Vulih-Shultzman I. Pinhasov A. Mandel S. Grigoriadis N. Touloumi O. Pittel Z. Gozes I. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), in agreement with the current data that suggest ADNP-related multigene regulation through the SWI/SNF complex that affects cytoskeletal organization and cell shape determination. Comprehensive work performed by Taylor and Knipe (26Taylor T.J. Knipe D.M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 5856-5866Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) revealed BRG1 to be exploited by the herpes simplex virus as part of its mechanisms of replication and infection in the mammalian cell. In this work the authors did not detect ADNP in the viral-associated complex containing BRG1. The lack of ADNP co-interaction in the viral BRG1 complex could be trivial and related to the antibodies used or may suggest that ADNP is not utilized by the herpes simplex virus like many other known BRG1 co-interacting proteins. Taken together, the current results lead to the uncovering of the molecular basis for ADNP as a vital gene important for cellular differentiation and cellular protection (Scheme 1), paving the path for novel drug design. In this respect the ADNP-derived eight-amino acid peptide fragment, NAP (NAPVSIPQ) (27Gozes I. Morimoto B.H. Tiong J. Fox A.W. Sutherland K. Dangoor D. Holtser-Cochav M. Vered K. Newton P. Aisen P.S.

Steingart R.A. Gozes I. J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 973-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and reduces p53 expression (29Gozes I. Steingart R.A. Spier A.D. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 67-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) without affecting cell division (10Pinhasov A. Mandel S. Torchinsky A. Giladi E. Pittel Z. Goldsweig A.M. Servoss S.J. Brenneman D.E. Gozes I. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2003; 144: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), is currently in phase II clinical development.

https://openalex.org/W1975267282,"FOXP2 is a transcription factor implicated in the development and neural control of orofacial coordination, particularly with respect to vocalisation. Observations that orthologues show almost no variation across vertebrates yet differ by two amino acids between humans and chimpanzees have led to speculation that recent evolutionary changes might relate to the emergence of language. Echolocating bats face especially challenging sensorimotor demands, using vocal signals for orientation and often for prey capture. To determine whether mutations in the FoxP2 gene could be associated with echolocation, we sequenced FoxP2 from echolocating and non-echolocating bats as well as a range of other mammal species. We found that contrary to previous reports, FoxP2 is not highly conserved across all nonhuman mammals but is extremely diverse in echolocating bats. We detected divergent selection (a change in selective pressure) at FoxP2 between bats with contrasting sonar systems, suggesting the intriguing possibility of a role for FoxP2 in the evolution and development of echolocation. We speculate that observed accelerated evolution of FoxP2 in bats supports a previously proposed function in sensorimotor coordination."

Phosphorylation of EGFR is negatively regulated by PTPs, but details of the mechanism by which 1,2-NQ inhibits PTPs have not been elucidated. Results described in this report demonstrate that 1,2-NQ forms covalent bonds with PTP1B after exposure to human epithelial A431 cells. In this study, a concentration-dependent phosphorylation of EGFR was found to be coupled to the reduction of PTP activity in the cells. The reduction in PTP activity was due to the irreversible modification of PTP1B, and when PTP1B was overexpressed by the cells, the 1,2-NQ-mediated EGFR phosphorylation was suppressed. Studies with purified PTP1B and 1,2-NQ showed that the reduction in enzyme activity was due to a nucleophilic attack by the quinone on the enzyme, to form covalent bonds. Matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis and mutation experiments revealed that PTP1B inactivation was primarily due to covalent attachment of the quinone to Cys-121 of the enzyme, with binding to His-25 and Cys-215 as well. Collectively, the results show that covalent attachment of 1,2-NQ to PTP1B is at least partially responsible for the reduction of PTP activity, which leads to prolonged transactivation of EGFR in the cells. 1,2-Naphthoquinone (1,2-NQ), an atmospheric contaminant, causes the contraction of guinea pig trachea through the activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by inhibiting protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs).

Most intracellular signaling cascades are mediated by receptor tyrosine kinases, and the activated signals are transmitted to downstream proteins by sequential phosphorylation.

PTPs are a diverse family of enzymes that can be divided into several subgroups, including receptor PTPs and non-receptor PTPs. All PTPs contain an essential cysteine residue in the active site motif, HCX5R(S/T) (1Zhang Z.Y. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 209-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). This sulfhydryl group, as thiolate anion, contributes to the formation of a thiol-phosphate intermediate in the dephosphorylation reaction and is therefore essential for enzyme activity (2Barford D. Jia Z. Tonks N.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Because of the low pKa of the catalytic cysteine (e.g. ∼5.4 for mammalian PTPs) (3Lohse D.L. Denu J.M. Santoro N. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4568-4575Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), PTP thiols are readily oxidized to their sulfenic acid (-SOH) state by reactive oxygen species (ROS) (4Claiborne A.

Yim M.B. Chock P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34543-34546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), thereby decreasing dephosphorylation activity. Current consensus is that PTP activity is regulated by endogenous oxidant such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in cells (6Caselli A. Marzocchini R. Camici G. Manao G. Moneti G. Pieraccini G. Ramponi G.

The decreased PTP activity associated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation caused by H2O2 is transient and restored by cellular reduction systems (8Tonks N.K. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). However, if reactive thiols of PTPs undergo covalent modification by exogenous electrophiles, irreversible inactivation of PTPs, resulting in prolonged phosphorylation of EGFR, would occur. We have been examining the reactivity and toxicology of selected quinones (9Kumagai Y. Koide S. Taguchi K. Endo A. Nakai Y. Yoshikawa T. Shimojo N. Chem. Res.

Quinones, including 1,2-NQ of this study, have been found at significant concentrations in vehicle exhaust particles and in ambient air samples (14Chung M.Y. Lazaro R.A. Lim D. Jackson J. Lyon J.

Pantikaki V. Environ. Chem. 2006; 3: 118-123Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar), so their toxic actions have considerable relevance to understanding air pollution toxicity. Quinones are a class of organic compounds that undergo two toxicologically relevant reactions (9Kumagai Y. Koide S. Taguchi K. Endo A. Nakai Y. Yoshikawa T. Shimojo N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 17Bolton J.L. Trush M.A. Penning T.M. Dryhurst G. Monks T.J. Chem. Res.

One is as an electrophile, forming covalent bonds with tissue nucleophiles to irreversibly alter key cellular proteins. In the second reaction the quinone acts as an electron transfer agent, transferring electrons from a reducing source such as NADPH to oxygen, generating ROS such as H2O2. We recently reported that 1,2-NQ elicits a contraction of smooth muscle in guinea pig tracheal preparations under conditions that indicated transactivation of EGFR was involved in the contraction process (19Kikuno S. Taguchi K. Iwamoto N. Yamano S. Cho A.K. Froines J.R. Kumagai Y. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2006; 210: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These studies also suggested that 1,2-NQ-induced EGFR activation was caused, at least partially, by covalent modification and/or thiol oxidation of PTP1B, leading to the reduction of its dephosphorylation activity. Of the multiple PTPs, PTP1B is ubiquitously expressed (20Tonks N.K. Diltz C.D. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6722-6730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and negatively regulates receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR (21Haj F.G. Markova B. Klaman L.D. Bohmer F.D. Neel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 739-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), so that inhibition of this PTP would lead to EGFR activation. Although 1,2- and 1,4-NQ and their derivatives are reported to be potent inhibitors for PTP1B (22Urbanek R.A. Suchard S.J. Steelman G.B. Knappenberger K.S. Sygowski L.A. Veale C.A. Chapdelaine M.J.

This report describes results of a study of 1,2-NQ-PTP1B interaction, which demonstrates that 1,2-NQ-mediated covalent modification of PTP1B, accompanied by reduction of its enzyme activity, results in the transactivation of EGFR in human epithelial A431 cells. The results also show that arylation of PTP1B through Cys-121 is the predominant event in the loss of enzyme activity caused by 1,2-NQ.

EGFR-neutralizing antibody LA-1 was purchased from Upstate (Lake Placid, NY). All other reagents used were of the highest purity available. Preparation of Anti-1,2-NQ—The polyclonal antibody against 1,2-NQ was prepared by a modification of the method of Zheng and Hammock (24Zheng J. Hammock B.D. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 904-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Water-soluble keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH, 20 mg) was dissolved in 3.5 ml of 4 m guanidinium chloride, followed by addition of 20 mg of dithiothreitol (DTT) to reduce oxidized thiol groups of the KLH. The mixture was stirred under argon at room temperature in the dark for 2 h. The reduced proteins were loaded to an Econo-Pac 10 DG column (Bio-Rad), which had been equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm EDTA to remove DTT. Then the KLH solution (equivalent to 10 mg) was mixed with 1,2-NQ (1 mg dissolved in Me2SO) under argon at 25 °C for 20 min, and the mixture was dialyzed against the equilibrated buffer described above. The binding efficiency of 1,2-NQ to KLH was measured using a Shimadzu high-performance liquid chromatography system (Kyoto, Japan). An aliquot (40 μl) of the reaction mixture was applied to an AM-type YMC-ODS column (250 × 4.6-mm inner diameter, 5-μm particle size, Yamamura Labs, Kyoto, Japan), at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Water/acetonitrile (3:2, v/v) was used as the mobile phase, and detection was performed at 255 nm. Under these conditions, the retention time of 1,2-NQ was 7.9 min. Final preparation of KLH-1,2-NQ adduct was 0.33 mg of 1,2-NQ bound per milligram of KLH. Antibodies against 1,2-NQ were raised in male New Zealand White rabbits. The IgG fraction was isolated from the serum obtained according to previously described methods (25Kumagai Y. Lin L.Y. Hiratsuka A. Narimatsu S. Suzuki T. Yamada H. Oguri K. Yoshimura H. Cho A.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 359-365PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—Human epidermoid carcinoma cell line A431 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm Gluta Max-1 and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin). A431 cells were grown to ∼70% confluency on 35-mm plates. Transfection was performed with FuGENE HD transfection reagent according to manufacturerŉs instructions. A431 cells were transfected with lacZ (pcDNA/His-lacZ) or PTP1B (pcDNA/His-PTP1B) for 48 h. Western Blotting—Cells were extracted with radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EGTA, 0.4 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture. Each sample was normalized to a protein content of 20 μg then mixed with half the volume of SDS-PAGE loading buffer consisting of 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 24% glycerol, 6% SDS, 15% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.015% bromphenol blue. The samples were heated at 95 °C for 1 min and were separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5 or 12% acrylamide) (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206977) Google Scholar). Electrophoresed proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Blots were blocked for 12 h with 5% skim milk in TTBS (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Tween 20), washed briefly and incubated with the indicated primary antibodies. Anti-EGFR (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY), anti-phospho EGFR that recognized Tyr-1068 (Sigma), anti-PTP1B (see below), and anti-1,2-NQ were used as primary antibodies. HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-sheep that recognized anti-phospho EGFR, HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, and HRP-conjugated horse anti-mouse (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) were used as secondary antibodies. For immunoprecipitation studies, cell lysates were incubated with Affi-gel 10 (Bio-Rad) cross-linked with anti-37-kDa PTP1B IgG (8.2 mg of protein/ml of gel) which was prepared according to the manufacturerŉs instructions. The gels were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 1 min and then washed with 1 ml of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer three times, and the PTP1B from the cell lysates was eluted with 20 μl of 0.1 m glycine-HCl (pH 3.0) at 25 °C. Proteins were detected by immunoblot analysis as described above. Protein bands on the membrane were detected by using chemiluminescence reagents and film according to the manufacturerŉs instructions (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp.) and exposed on high-performance chemiluminescence film (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp.) (27Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2157) Google Scholar). Data for Western blotting are representative of three or more experiments. Protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad Protein assay kit (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215535) Google Scholar) or the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce), with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Mutagenesis and Protein Expression—Complementary DNA, corresponding to the 37-kDa form (NH2-terminal 321 residues) of PTP1B, was obtained by PCR, placed downstream of the phage T7 RNA polymerase promoter at the NdeI site of pET15b. A plasmid containing the isolated catalytic domain of human 37-kDa PTP1B in a pET15b vector was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis. Cys-to-Ser and His-to-Ala mutations were introduced using a PCR-based approach following established procedures (29Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. Green Publishing Associates/Jhon Wiley & Sons, Inc, New York1992: 8.1-8.19Google Scholar). The resulting construct was verified by DNA sequencing on an ABI 310 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The resulting plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21 cells for protein expression. The bacterial cultures were grown in LB broth at 37 °C with shaking at 120 rpm (TAITEC, Saitama, Japan) to 0.6 absorbance units at 600 nm. The cultures were then induced by the addition of 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown for an additional 20 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the cell lysates were analyzed by electrophoresis and immunoblotting using the protocol outlined above. Purification of 37-kDa PTP1B and Its Mutants—All steps during purification were performed at 4 °C. E. coli BL21 cells transformed with the expression vector were suspended in lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol. The supernatant was retained following centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h of the sonicated-cell lysates, and then applied to a Ni-IDA ProBond (Invitrogen) column (4 × 1 cm inner diameter), which had been equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol solution. The affinity column was extensively washed with the equilibrated buffer, and then 37-kDa PTP1B and its mutants were eluted with the buffer containing 100 mm imidazole. The purity of the PTP1B preparations, as assessed by SDS-PAGE, was >90%. Thiol groups oxidized during purification were reduced by incubation with 20 mm DTT for 1 h, and the DTT was removed by an Econo-Pac 10 DG column. Each enzyme preparation was stored in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) at–80 °C before use. The polyclonal antibody against 37-kDa PTP1B was prepared by the same method used for anti-1,2-NQ. Dephosphorylation Activity—Cultured cells were treated with different concentrations of 1,2-NQ for 10 min. Then, the medium was removed, and cell radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer was added to the culture dish. The cell extracts were scraped from the dish and transferred to microcentrifuge tubes. Supernatants obtained from centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min were used for phosphatase assays. Phosphatase Assay—Briefly, cell lysate (100 μg) was incubated with 4 mm pNPP and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, bovine serum albumin (0.1 mg/ml). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 min at 37 °C and terminated by addition of 1.8 ml of 1 m NaOH. The pNP formed was determined at 400 nm using a Hitachi U-1500 spectrophotometer (Tokyo, Japan). A two-stage incubation method was employed to monitor the effect of 1,2-NQ on PTP1B activity. The incubation mixture (0.2 ml) for the first stage consisted of 37-kDa PTP1B (0.1 mg), different concentrations of 1,2-NQ and 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, unless other noted. Reactions were initiated by addition of 1,2-NQ. After incubation at 25 °C for various times, aliquots (1 μl) were transferred to the second incubation mixture (1 ml) to determine PTP1B activity. The second incubation reaction mixture consisted of the aliquot, 4 mm pNPP, 100 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.5), and 0.1 mm EDTA. Incubations were carried out at 25 °C for 10 min and terminated by addition of NaOH to make a final concentration of 1 m. Under these conditions, dephosphorylation of pNPP was linear with time and protein concentration. Determination of Free SH Groups—PTP1B was incubated at 25 °C with 50 μm 1,2-NQ in a total volume of 200 μl containing 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). After 10 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 300 μl of 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.2), 20 mm EDTA. The reaction mixture and control untreated enzymes were mixed with solution containing 20 μl of 10 mm DTNB, 150 μl of 5% SDS, and 830 μl of H2O. After 2 min, the concentration of thionitrobenzoic acid released was determined spectrophotometrically using a molar extinction coefficient of 13,600 at 412 nm (30Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)—PTP1B was incubated with 0 or 50 μm 1,2-NQ for 10 min at 25 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) and then dialyzed into 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) using an Econo-Pac 10 DG column to remove free 1,2-NQ. The trypsin-digested PTP1B were mixed with DTT and trifluoroacetic acid. To improve the ionization efficiency of mass spectrometry, samples were purified with Zip-tip C4 or C18 (Millipore, Bed-ford, MA) before MS and MS/MS analysis. Peptides were mixed with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (2.5 mg/ml) containing 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and dried on stainless steel targets at room temperature and pressure. The analyses were performed using an Ultraflex MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics Japan, Ltd., Tokyo) with a nitrogen laser. All analyses were in the positive ion mode, and the instrument was calibrated immediately prior to each series of studies. Data Analysis—All data were expressed as means ± S.E. from at least three independent experiments. Statistical significance was considered at p < 0.05. Data were fitted by nonlinear regression analysis according to a Michaelis-Menten kinetic model (GraphPad Prism version 4.0, San Diego, CA). Phosphorylation of EGFR Coupled to Reduction of PTP Activity by 1,2-NQ in the Cellular System—Exposure of A431 cells to 1,2-NQ for 10 min caused a concentration-dependent phosphorylation of EGFR (Fig. 1A). Under these conditions, 1,2-NQ also inhibited cellular PTP activity in a concentration-dependent manner, but the reduction of PTP activity by 1,2-NQ reached a plateau at 50 μm (Fig. 1A). To examine whether or not 1,2-NQ-induced EGFR phosphorylation is ligand-dependent, we pretreated the cells with a EGFR-neutralizing antibody LA-1 for EGFR prior to exposure of A431 cells to 1,2-NQ. As shown in Fig. 1B, A431 cells subjected to the EGFR-neutralizing antibody LA-1 exhibited a complete inhibition of EGF-induced EGFR phosphorylation, whereas only a slight suppression of 1,2-NQ-induced EGFR phosphorylation was detected. These results suggested that a ligand-independent EGFR phosphorylation through the inhibition of PTP activity occurs during exposure of A431 cells to 1,2-NQ. In temporal experiments conducted over 720 min, EGFR phosphorylation by EGF in A431 cells was seen up to 180 min, after which it declined (Fig. 1C). In contrast, EGFR activation caused by 1,2-NQ was persistent even at 720 min but with a biphasic transactivation of EGFR phosphorylation (see Fig. 1C). Because PTP inactivation by 1,2-NQ could be due to either thiolate oxidation or arylation, we examined the effect of ROS-scavenging agents on the transactivation. H2O2-mediated phosphorylation of EGFR was blocked by pretreatment of A431 cells with either catalase conjugated with polyethylene glycol or Trolox, a scavenging agent for ROS, whereas EGFR activation caused by 1,2-NQ was not (supplemental Fig. S1). These results suggest that such a prolonged phosphorylation of EGFR during exposure of A431 cells to 1,2-NQ was not due to thiol oxidation and could be due to covalent binding of this quinone to cellular PTPs. If PTP1B is responsible for the transactivation of EGFR caused by 1,2-NQ, overexpression of PTP1B in A431 cells should diminish EGFR phosphorylation by overwhelming the 1,2-NQ. Consistent with this notion, 1,2-NQ (20 μm)-induced activation of EGFR was suppressed by increasing PTP1B levels in the cells (Fig. 2A). To identify whether or not PTP1B is one of the molecular targets for irreversible modification by 1,2-NQ, we prepared a specific antibody against 1,2-NQ as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 2B, immunoprecipitation with anti-PTP1B, followed by Western blotting analysis with the anti-1,2-NQ, revealed that 1,2-NQ was covalently bound to PTP1B in A431 cells. To explore the mechanistic details of the covalent modification of PTP1B by 1,2-NQ further, we worked with purified 37-kDa PTP1B in subsequent experiments. Involvement of Covalent Binding of 1,2-NQ in Decreased 37-kDa PTP1B Activity—As shown in Fig. 3A, 37-kDa PTP1B activity was inhibited by 1,2-NQ in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The apparent first order decay rates were linear with concentration with a slope of 0.014 μm –1 min–1. When fixed concentrations of 1,2-NQ were incubated with PTP1B for 10 min, the reduction of PTP1B activity caused by 1,2-NQ paralleled the increase in covalent modification of this quinone to PTP1B (Fig. 3B). H2O2 is reported to inhibit PTP1B activity through the oxidation of Cys-215 presumably to the corresponding sulfenic acid (7Lee S.R. Kwon K.S. Kim S.R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15366-15372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar), but the decreased PTP1B activity was readily restored by addition of 4 mm DTT through reduction of the oxidized thiol groups (Fig. 3C). However, DTT had no effect on the loss of PTP1B activity caused by 1,2-NQ (Fig. 3C), supporting the notion that an irreversible or covalent bond-based inactivation rather than thiol oxidation of 1,2-NQ is occurring. To further characterize the covalent modification of PTP1B by 1,2-NQ, we compared 1,2-NQ with the other naphthalene derivatives shown in Fig. 4A. In earlier studies we observed guinea pig tracheal contraction caused by 1,2-NQ by EGFR phosphorylation, whereas trans-1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene and naphthalene (see Fig. 4A) were without effect on the contractile action and activation of EGFR (19Kikuno S. Taguchi K. Iwamoto N. Yamano S. Cho A.K. Froines J.R. Kumagai Y. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2006; 210: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This suggests an obligatory role of an electrophilic function in the contraction of guinea pig trachea. As shown in Fig. 4B, the extent of covalent binding of 1,2-NQ (5 and 50 μm) increased with a corresponding reduction of 37-kDa PTP1B activity. However, trans-1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene and naphthalene, which are incapable of binding to PTP1B, did not exhibit any inhibitory action on PTP1B (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that the decreased PTP1B activity was dependent on the electrophilic property of 1,2-NQ. Modification Sites of 1,2-NQ—We then measured the thiol content of 37-kDa PTP1B after reaction with 1,2-NQ. Although there are six equivalents of cysteine residues in 37-kDa PTP1B (Cys-32, Cys-92, Cys-121, Cys-215, Cys-226, and Cys-231), the thiol content of the PTP1B prepared in the present study was 5.41 ± 0.28 equivalents of thiol per mol of molecule (n = 6). When we determined the stoichiometry of the interaction of 50 μm 1,2-NQ with 13 μm 37-kDa PTP1B, as determined by the consumption of reactive thiols and remaining 1,2-NQ during a 10-min reaction of the protein with 1,2-NQ at 25 °C, it was suggested that approximately two equivalents of thiols in PTP1B underwent chemical modification by 1,2-NQ. MALDI-TOF MS Analysis of Arylated 37-kDa PTP1B—To determine the modification sites in 1,2-NQ, the native and 1,2-NQ-treated PTP1B were digested with trypsin and then analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. Peptide mass mapping by MALDI-TOF MS analysis of the tryptic fragments from the native PTP1B accounted for ∼70% of the protein sequence (Fig. 5 and Table 1). Compared with the calculated mass of the unmodified peptides, modified peptides P-1 to P-4, showed an increased mass of +156 Da, corresponding to the addition of a single equivalent of 1,2-NQ. The peptides, their sequence and masses are: P-1 (CAQYWPQK, m/z = 1179.6), P-2 (HEASDFPCR, m/z = 1217.6), P-3 (GSLKCAQYWPQK, m/z = 1564.6), and P-4 (ESGSLSPEHGPVVVHCSAGIGR, m/z = 2330.1) (Fig. 5 and Table 1). These peptides were also detected in the selective ion monitoring analysis of tryptic peptides from the 1,2-NQ-treated PTP1B using electrospray ionization-liquid chromatography-MS (supplemental Fig. S2).

https://openalex.org/W2064141839,"Background Most animal species display Sexual Size Dimorphism (SSD): males and females consistently attain different sizes, most frequently with females being larger than males. However the selective mechanisms driving patterns of SSD remain controversial. ‘Rensch's rule’ proposes a general scaling phenomenon for all taxa, whereby SSD increases with average body size when males are larger than females, and decreases with body size when females are larger than males. Rensch's rule appears to be general in the former case, but there is little evidence for the rule when females are larger then males. Methodology/Principal Findings Using comprehensive data for 1291 species of birds across 30 families, we find strong support for Rensch's rule in families where males are typically larger than females, but no overall support for the rule in families with female-biased SSD. Reviewing previous studies of a broad range of taxa (arthropods, reptiles, fish and birds) showing predominantly female-biased SSD, we conclude that Rensch's conjecture is the exception rather than the rule in such species. Conclusions/Significance The absence of consistent scaling of SSD in taxa with female-biased SSD, the most prevalent direction of dimorphism, calls into question previous general evolutionary explanations for Rensch's rule. We propose that, unlike several other ecological scaling relationships, Rensch's rule does not exist as an independent scaling phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2113613707,"Background The mechanism behind the association between human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules and the rate of HIV-1 disease progression is still poorly understood. Recent data suggest that “protective” HLA molecules, i.e. those associated with a low HIV-1 viral load and relatively slow disease progression, tend to present epitopes from the Gag capsid protein. Although this suggests that preferential targeting of Gag delays disease progression, the apparent preference for Gag could also be a side-effect of the relatively high immunogenicity of the protein. Methods and Findings To separate cause and effect, we predicted HIV-1 epitopes from the whole genome of HIV-1, and found that protective HLA alleles have a true preference for the p24 Gag protein, while non-protective HLA alleles preferentially target HIV-1 Nef. In line with this, we found a significant negative correlation between the predicted affinity of the best-binding p24 epitopes and the relative hazard of HIV-1 disease progression for a large number of HLA molecules. When the epitopes targeted by protective HLA alleles were mapped to the known p24 structure, we found that mutations in these epitopes are likely to disturb the p24 dimer structure, which is expected to severely reduce the fitness of the virus. Conclusions Our results suggest that the intrinsic preference of different HLA molecules to present p24 peptides explains why some HLA molecules are more protective than others."
https://openalex.org/W2060921177,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric enzyme that is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals and functions to maintain cellular and whole body energy homeostasis. Studies in experimental animals demonstrate that activation of AMPK in skeletal muscle protects against insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and obesity. The regulatory gamma(3) subunit of AMPK is expressed exclusively in skeletal muscle; however, its importance in controlling overall AMPK activity is unknown. While evidence is emerging that gamma subunit mutations interfere specifically with AMP activation, there remains some controversy regarding the impact of gamma subunit mutations. Here we report the first gain-of-function mutation in the muscle-specific regulatory gamma(3) subunit in humans.We sequenced the exons and splice junctions of the AMPK gamma(3) gene (PRKAG3) in 761 obese and 759 lean individuals, identifying 87 sequence variants including a novel R225W mutation in subjects from two unrelated families. The gamma(3) R225W mutation is homologous in location to the gamma(2)R302Q mutation in patients with Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome and to the gamma(3)R225Q mutation originally linked to an increase in muscle glycogen content in purebred Hampshire Rendement Napole (RN-) pigs. We demonstrate in differentiated muscle satellite cells obtained from the vastus lateralis of R225W carriers that the mutation is associated with an approximate doubling of both basal and AMP-activated AMPK activities. Moreover, subjects bearing the R225W mutation exhibit a approximately 90% increase of skeletal muscle glycogen content and a approximately 30% decrease in intramuscular triglyceride (IMTG).We have identified for the first time a mutation in the skeletal muscle-specific regulatory gamma(3) subunit of AMPK in humans. The gamma(3)R225W mutation has significant functional effects as demonstrated by increases in basal and AMP-activated AMPK activities, increased muscle glycogen and decreased IMTG. Overall, these findings are consistent with an important regulatory role for AMPK gamma(3) in human muscle energy metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2116307430,"An experienced car mechanic can often deduce what's wrong with a car by carefully listening to the sound of the ailing engine, despite the presence of multiple sources of noise. Indeed, the ability to select task-relevant sounds for awareness, whilst ignoring irrelevant ones, constitutes one of the most fundamental of human faculties, but the underlying neural mechanisms have remained elusive. While most of the literature explains the neural basis of selective attention by means of an increase in neural gain, a number of papers propose enhancement in neural selectivity as an alternative or a complementary mechanism.Here, to address the question whether pure gain increase alone can explain auditory selective attention in humans, we quantified the auditory cortex frequency selectivity in 20 healthy subjects by masking 1000-Hz tones by continuous noise masker with parametrically varying frequency notches around the tone frequency (i.e., a notched-noise masker). The task of the subjects was, in different conditions, to selectively attend to either occasionally occurring slight increments in tone frequency (1020 Hz), tones of slightly longer duration, or ignore the sounds. In line with previous studies, in the ignore condition, the global field power (GFP) of event-related brain responses at 100 ms from the stimulus onset to the 1000-Hz tones was suppressed as a function of the narrowing of the notch width. During the selective attention conditions, the suppressant effect of the noise notch width on GFP was decreased, but as a function significantly different from a multiplicative one expected on the basis of simple gain model of selective attention.Our results suggest that auditory selective attention in humans cannot be explained by a gain model, where only the neural activity level is increased, but rather that selective attention additionally enhances auditory cortex frequency selectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2114442515,"Activation of caspase-1 through the inflammasome protein Nalp1b controls anthrax lethal toxin (LT)-induced necrosis in murine macrophages. In this study we analyzed physiological changes controlled by caspase-1 in LT-treated murine macrophages. The caspase-1 inhibitor Boc-D-cmk blocked caspase-1 activity and membrane impairment in LT-treated cells. To determine the relationship between caspase-1 activation and membrane integrity, we added Boc-D-cmk to J774A.1 macrophages at different time points following LT exposure. Remarkably, Boc-D-cmk rescued LT-treated macrophages, even when added at the peak of caspase-1 activation. Late addition of the caspase-1 inhibitor reversed the losses of plasma membrane integrity and metabolic activity in these cells. Similar results were obtained with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, one of the most potent inhibitors of LT toxicity. LT-treated macrophages displaying evidence of membrane impairment recovered upon the addition of MG132, mirroring the Boc-D-cmk response. Strikingly, late addition of proteasome inhibitors also abrogated caspase-1 activity in LT-treated macrophages. Proteasomal control of caspase-1 activity and membrane impairment, however, was restricted to LT-induced cytolysis, because proteasome inhibitors did not block caspase-1 activation and cell death triggered by lipopolysaccharide and nigericin. Our findings indicate that proteasome inhibitors do not target caspase-1 directly but instead control an upstream event in LT-treated macrophages leading to caspase-1 activation. Taken together, caspase-1-mediated necrosis appears to be tightly controlled and differentially regulated by proteasomes depending on the source of caspase-1 induction.

Although LT uptake and subsequent MAPKK cleavage occur in all mammalian cells, LT is lethal to just a few targets, including antigen-presenting cells (11Hanna P.C. Acosta D. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl.

Therefore, MAPKK cleavage is insufficient for LT killing and is possibly not even required for this process (17Kim S.O. Jing Q. Hoebe K. Beutler B. Duesbery N.S. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7413-7421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the mouse model, the susceptibility of antigen-presenting cells to LT killing is strain-dependent. For example, BALB/c-derived macrophages and dendritic cells undergo rapid cytolysis following LT exposure, whereas those from C57BL/6 mice are resistant to rapid LT killing (12Alileche A.

The strain-specific sensitivity to LT is controlled by a dominant isoform of the inflammasome protein Nalp1b (22Boyden E.D. Dietrich W.F. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Nalp1b belongs to the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor (NLR) family of intracellular surveillance receptors. Upon recognition of pathogen-associated molecules, NLR proteins recruit downstream factors, resulting in the formation of the inflammasome complex (23Tschopp J. Martinon F. Burns K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 24Martinon F. Burns K. Tschopp J. Mol.

Trends Immunol. 2005; 26: 447-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). This complex includes caspase-1, a well characterized inflammatory caspase, which is activated through oligomerization (26Martinon F. Tschopp J. Cell. 2004; 117: 561-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Activated caspase-1 then goes on to process the constitutively expressed cytokines pro-interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18, generating an inflammatory response (27Mariathasan S. Monack D.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Caspase-1 activity is central to LT killing of BALB/c-derived macrophages. Cells harboring the dominant isoform of Nalp1b but deficient in caspase-1 are resistant to the toxin (22Boyden E.D. Dietrich W.F. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we recently found that specific caspase-1 inhibition by small peptides efficiently blocks LT-mediated necrosis in murine macrophages (21Muehlbauer S.M. Evering T.H. Bonuccelli G. Squires R.C. Ashton A.W. Porcelli S.A. Lisanti M.P. Brojatsch J. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Caspase-1 has also been implicated in mediating killing of immune cells infected with several microbial pathogens. Infection of macrophages by Salmonella enterica (28Fink S.L. Cookson B.T. Cell.

Microbiol. 2005; 7: 1447-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) triggers cell death in a caspase-1-dependent fashion. The mechanism of cell death induction by these pathogens remains to be shown. Several reports suggest that caspase-1-mediated cell death is independent of interleukin processing and release (21Muehlbauer S.M. Evering T.H. Bonuccelli G. Squires R.C. Ashton A.W. Porcelli S.A.

Therefore, caspase-1 appears to target cellular proteins other than IL-1β and IL-18 to mediate cytopathic effects. Here we report that caspase-1 activity correlates with impairment of the plasma membrane in macrophages undergoing LT-induced necrosis. We found that caspase-1 inhibitors reversed membrane perturbation and restored metabolic function in LT-treated macrophages, even when added at the peak of caspase-1 activity. These results point to a remarkable capacity for repair in these cells. Caspase-1 inhibitor studies mirrored those obtained with proteasome inhibitors, which also abolished caspase-1 activity in LT-treated macrophages. However, caspase-1 is not directly controlled by the proteasome, because proteasome inhibition had no effect on caspase-1 activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and nigericin. Taken together, we demonstrate differential regulation of caspase-1-mediated necrosis in murine macrophages. Animals, Cell Culture, and Materials—C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, MN). Murine J774A.1 and RAW264.7 macrophages (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and RPMI medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 IU/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Mediatech, Herndon, VA). Recombinant anthrax PA and LF (List Biological Laboratories, Campbell, CA) were reconstituted in sterile water and used at 500 ng/ml PA and 250 ng/ml LF. The ionophore nigericin, the proteasome inhibitor MG132, and the caspase inhibitory peptides Boc-D-cmk, z-VAD-fmk, and Ac-YVAD-cmk were purchased from Calbiochem and used at the concentrations indicated. LPS (Sigma-Aldrich) was applied to cells at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. Generation of Murine Bone Marrow-derived Macrophages (BMMs)—BMMs were prepared from C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice and maintained as described previously (21Muehlbauer S.M. Evering T.H. Bonuccelli G. Squires R.C. Ashton A.W. Porcelli S.A. Lisanti M.P. Brojatsch J. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, bone marrow cells were flushed from tibias and femurs and differentiated into BMMs by incubation for 6 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES, 2.0 mm l-glutamine, 0.05 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm minimum essential medium nonessential amino acids, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 20% conditioned medium from a confluent culture of L929 fibroblasts as a source of CSF-1. After removal of nonadherent cells, macrophages were recovered by washing plates with cold PBS containing 5 mm EDTA. BMMs were routinely assayed by flow cytometry and were positive for surface markers F4/80 and CD-11b. The medium for BMM maintenance was as above but with 10% conditioned L929 medium. Propidium Iodide Uptake Assays—Macrophages were seeded on 96-well plates and exposed to LT or to LPS and nigericin, in the presence or absence of Boc-D-cmk or MG132. Cytopathic effects following toxin challenge were assessed by propidium iodide (PI) uptake. At the end of the assay, 25 μm PI was added to each well. The fluorescence was then read in a Wallac Victor II multi-titer plate reader at 590 nm (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Membrane Permeability by Flow Cytometry—J774A.1 macrophages were seeded on 24-well plates and exposed to LT in the presence or absence of 40 μm Boc-D-cmk, z-VAD-fmk, or Ac-YVAD-cmk. At different time points post-treatment, the cells were detached in PBS containing 2.6 μm TO-PRO-3 (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA). The membrane permeability of TO-PRO-3 was detected in the FL-4 channel on a FACS-Calibur running CellQuest Pro software (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Cell Viability by Water-soluble Tetrazolium Assay—Cell viability was measured by analysis of the cleavage of the water-soluble tetrazolium (WST) salt WST-1 to formazan by cellular redox enzymes (37Berridge M.V. Herst P.M. Tan A.S. Biotechnol. Annu. Rev. 2005; 11: 127-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). RAW 264.7 macrophages were cultured in 96-well plates and treated with LT in the presence or absence of 10 μm MG132 and 80 μm Boc-D-cmk. Following treatment, 10 μl of WST-1 solution (BioVision, Mountain View, CA) was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. The colorimetric reading of the WST-1 signal was determined in a Wallac Victor II multi-titer plate reader at 450 nm (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Western Blotting—Macrophages were cultured in 24-well plates and treated with LT or with LPS and nigericin, in the presence or absence of 40 μm Boc-D-cmk, z-VAD-cmk, Ac-YVAD-cmk, or 10 μm MG132. For Western blotting, culture medium was removed, and the cells were lysed in the wells with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Boston BioProducts, Worcester, MA) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The supernatants were cleared by centrifugation, and the sample concentration was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). The samples were then mixed with SDS buffer and denatured at 100 °C for 3 min. Equivalent amounts of protein were size-fractionated on 15-well SDS-Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were probed with primary anti-murine polyclonal antibodies against IL-18 (BioVision, Mountain View, CA), actin (Sigma-Aldrich), or ubiquitin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). We used a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The blots were developed using ECL Plus solution (Amersham Biosciences). Fluorescence Microscopy—J774A.1 macrophages were cultured on Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nunc, Rochester, NY) and exposed to LT in the presence or absence of 9 or 40 μm Boc-D-cmk. At different time points post-treatment, the cells were washed in PBS and stained with 0.5 μm PI for 5 min before fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were washed again in PBS and then permeabilized in ice-cold PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 40 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 nuclear counter-stain (Invitrogen). The coverslips were mounted using Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The experiments were performed with an Olympus IX81 electronically motorized microscope (Center Valley, PA). Caspase-1 Activity Controls Membrane Integrity in LT-treated Macrophages—Nalp1b was recently identified as the genetic factor responsible for induction of LT-induced necrosis in BALB/c macrophages (22Boyden E.D. Dietrich W.F. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). A component of the murine inflammasome complex, Nalp1b presumably activates caspase-1, which has been linked to LT-induced necrosis (21Muehlbauer S.M. Evering T.H. Bonuccelli G. Squires R.C. Ashton A.W. Porcelli S.A. Lisanti M.P. Brojatsch J. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 22Boyden E.D. Dietrich W.F. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). To explore the connection between caspase-1 activation and necrosis in LT toxicity, we challenged J774A.1 macrophages with a cytotoxic dose of LT (500 ng/ml PA and 250 ng/ml LF) (20Alileche A. Squires R.C. Muehlbauer S.M. Lisanti M.P. Brojatsch J. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 21Muehlbauer S.M. Evering T.H. Bonuccelli G. Squires R.C. Ashton A.W. Porcelli S.A. Lisanti M.P. Brojatsch J. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 38Tang G. Leppla S.H. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3055-3060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence of caspase-1 inhibitors: Boc-D-cmk, Ac-YVAD-cmk, and z-VAD-fmk. Caspase-1 activation was monitored by analysis of the cleavage of IL-18, and cytotoxic effects were determined by TOPRO-3 dye uptake using flow cytometry. The 18-kDa band of mature IL-18 was detected 60 min post-LT exposure and reached peak levels at 90 min (Fig. 1A). Consistent with the role of caspase-1 in LT killing (21Muehlbauer S.M. Evering T.H. Bonuccelli G. Squires R.C. Ashton A.W. Porcelli S.A. Lisanti M.P. Brojatsch J. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 22Boyden E.D. Dietrich W.F. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar), the caspase-1 inhibitor Boc-D-cmk (40 μm) completely blocked caspase-1 activity and cell killing in LT-treated J774A.1 macrophages (Fig. 1). However, we detected IL-18 processing and membrane impairment in LT-treated macrophages in the presence of 40 μm Ac-YVAD-cmk and z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 1) or with concentrations of Boc-D-cmk 9 μm or below (data not shown). Cytopathic effects in these cells were associated with residual caspase-1 activity (Fig. 1), suggesting that low levels of activated caspase-1 are toxic to macrophages. To further analyze the efficiency of caspase-1 inhibition in blocking LT toxicity, we subjected LT-treated macrophages to increasing concentrations of Boc-D-cmk. Induction of necrosis was monitored using PI uptake assays. As expected, 40 μm Boc-D-cmk completely prevented PI uptake in LT-treated J774A.1 macrophages (Fig. 2). However, we detected transient membrane impairment in LT-treated J774A.1 cells in the presence of suboptimal (9 μm) Boc-D-cmk concentrations. The PI signal in these cells peaked 120 min following Boc-D-cmk exposure, before decreasing to background levels 150 and 180 min post-Boc-D-cmk (Fig. 2). Likewise, temporary membrane impairment also occurred in LT-treated BALB/c-derived RAW 264.7 macrophages in the presence of suboptimal (2 μm) Boc-D-cmk concentrations, as analyzed by PI uptake assays (see supplemental Fig. S1). In these cells, PI uptake peaked at 180 min before rapidly decreasing to background levels. As described for J774A.1 cells, 40 μm Boc-D-cmk completely prevented dye uptake in LT-treated RAW 264.7 cells (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1). Similar results were obtained when we monitored lactate dehydrogenase release in lieu of PI uptake (data not shown). Inhibitor efficiency was also examined by PI staining using fluorescence microscopy. As in Fig. 2, J774A.1 macrophages were treated with LT and either 9 or 40 μm Boc-D-cmk. A 79% increase in PI fluorescence over background was visible in J774A.1 cells 90 min after toxin exposure, approaching 98% PI-positive cells by 120 min (Fig. 3). The suboptimal dose of 9 μm Boc-D-cmk permitted a similar increase in membrane perturbation by 90 min post-LT exposure, reaching ∼87% PI-positive cells by 120 min (Fig. 3). In agreement with findings in Fig. 2, membrane impairment in the presence of 9 μm Boc-D-cmk was transient, because PI-fluorescence in these cells rapidly returned to control levels by 150 min post-LT. As expected, 40 μm Boc-D-cmk completely prevented any increase in membrane perturbation and PI uptake in LT-treated J774A.1 macrophages (Fig. 3). Taken together our results suggested that complete inhibition of caspase-1 is delayed in cells treated with suboptimal Boc-D-cmk concentrations, resulting in transient membrane impairment. Caspase-1 Controls Membrane Integrity and Cell Viability—Our findings provide evidence that LT-treated macrophages can recover from transient membrane impairment. To further characterize the correlation between membrane repair and caspase-1 inhibition, we added the caspase-1 inhibitor Boc-D-cmk to macrophages at different time points following LT exposure. J774A.1 macrophages were incubated with 40 μm Boc-D-cmk at 0, 90, and 120 min post-LT exposure, and membrane integrity was determined by PI uptake assays. As expected, Boc-D-cmk fully inhibited lysis of J774A.1 cells when added simultaneously with LT (Fig. 4). Remarkably, macrophages showed significant recovery when Boc-D-cmk was added as late as 90-120 min after LT exposure (Fig. 4). This recovery was preceded by a transient increase in membrane perturbation following addition of Boc-D-cmk, presumably because of a delay in complete caspase-1 inhibition (Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained in LT-treated RAW 264.7 macrophages following late addition of Boc-D-cmk (see supplemental Fig. S2), albeit with slower kinetics than observed in J774A.1 cells. Membrane integrity recovered in RAW 264.7 cells when 80 μm Boc-D-cmk was added as late as 120 and 150 min after LT exposure. These experiments indicate that caspase-1 inhibitors can rescue LT-treated macrophages at multiple late time points with nearly complete cell recovery. We also monitored cell viability in LT-treated RAW 264.7 cells by WST-1 assay, which is based on the reduction of a tetrazolium compound by cellular oxidoreductases utilizing mitochondria-generated NADH as the primary reductant (37Berridge M.V. Herst P.M. Tan A.S. Biotechnol. Annu. Rev. 2005; 11: 127-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar, 39Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45064) Google Scholar). A loss of WST signal indicates impairment of cellular and mitochondrial function. The WST signal dropped precipitously in the presence of LT, indicating severe metabolic impairment. This decrease was prevented when 80 μm Boc-D-cmk was added simultaneously with LT (Fig. 5). Similar to membrane rescue, WST activity recovered rapidly in RAW 264.7 macrophages following the addition of Boc-D-cmk at 120 and 150 min post-LT exposure (Fig. 5). These findings indicated that caspase-1 plays a role in metabolic impairment in LT killing. Taken together, our data point to the involvement of caspase-1 in the concurrent losses of cell metabolism and membrane integrity in LT-treated macrophages. Proteasomes Control Caspase-1 Activity in LT-treated Macrophages—The recovery of LT-treated macrophages following late addition of caspase-1 inhibitors mimics earlier findings with proteasome inhibitors (20Alileche A. Squires R.C. Muehlbauer S.M. Lisanti M.P. Brojatsch J. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that proteasome inhibitors efficiently block LT toxicity, even when added late to LT-treated macrophages or dendritic cells (12Alileche A. Serfass E.R. Muehlbauer S.M. Porcelli S.A. Brojatsch J. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: e19Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 20Alileche A. Squires R.C. Muehlbauer S.M. Lisanti M.P. Brojatsch J. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 38Tang G. Leppla S.H. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3055-3060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To directly compare the effects of caspase-1 and proteasome inhibition on LT killing, we treated J774A.1 macrophages with 40 μm of the caspase-1 inhibitor Boc-D-cmk or 10 μm of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 at 0, 60, 90, and 120 min post-LT exposure. By 60 min, cells exposed to LT alone had already undergone significant membrane perturbation (Fig. 6). Strikingly, membrane integrity completely recovered when the caspase-1 inhibitor Boc-D-cmk was added to macrophages 60 and 90 min post-LT exposure (PI uptake was tested at 180 min; Fig. 6A). Remarkably similar results were obtained following late addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 6B). The addition of Boc-D-cmk or MG132 120 min post-LT exposure, however, resulted only in limited recovery, indicating that the majority of cells had accumulated too much damage by that time (Fig. 6). Because both inhibitors exhibited similar kinetics and efficacy in rescuing membrane integrity in LT-treated macrophages, we tested whether proteasome inhibitors, like caspase-1 inhibitors, blocked caspase-1 activity. We added 40 μm Boc-D-cmk or 10 μm MG132 to J774A.1 macrophages at different time points following LT exposure and determined caspase-1 activity by analysis of IL-18 cleavage 180 min post-LT. Despite evidence of significant IL-18 processing 60 and 90 min into toxin treatment, no cleaved IL-18 was observed following late addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 7). Late MG132 addition efficiently blocked caspase-1 activation as well as cytolysis in LT-treated macrophages. The absence of processed IL-18 in the MG132-treated macrophages 180 min post-LT suggested that the inhibitor blocked further IL-18 processing but did not interfere with the release of already processed IL-18. As expected, no IL-18 cleavage products were detected 180 min post-LT following addition of the caspase-1 inhibitor Boc-D-cmk 60 min into toxin treatment (Fig. 7). Residual processed IL-18, however, was detected when the caspase-1 inhibitor was added 90 min post-LT exposure. Taken together, caspase-1 and proteasome inhibitors blocked IL-18 processing and LT killing even when added at the peak of caspase-1 activation. This remarkable similarity suggested that both inhibitors block caspase-1 activation in LT-treated macrophages. To rule out the possibility that Boc-D-cmk interfered with LT toxicity by inhibiting the proteasome, we probed lysates of Boc-D-cmk- and MG132-treated J774A.1 macrophages for levels of ubiquitinated proteins by Western blot. Inhibition of the proteasome leads to accumulat"
https://openalex.org/W2092145673,"Infection with Plasmodium falciparum during pregnancy is one of the major causes of malaria related morbidity and mortality in newborn and mothers. The complications of pregnancy-associated malaria result mainly from massive adhesion of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (IE) to chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) present in the placental intervillous blood spaces. Var2CSA, a member of the P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) family is the predominant parasite ligand mediating CSA binding. However, experimental evidence suggests that other host receptors, such as hyaluronic acid (HA) and the neonatal Fc receptor, may also support placental binding. Here we used parasites in which var2csa was genetically disrupted to evaluate the contribution of these receptors to placental sequestration and to identify additional adhesion receptors that may be involved in pregnancy-associated malaria. By comparison to the wild-type parasites, the FCR3delta var2csa mutants could not be selected for HA adhesion, indicating that var2csa is not only essential for IE cytoadhesion to the placental receptor CSA, but also to HA. However, further studies using different pure sources of HA revealed that the previously observed binding results from CSA contamination in the bovine vitreous humor HA preparation. To identify CSA-independent placental interactions, FCR3delta var2csa mutant parasites were selected for adhesion to the human placental trophoblastic BeWo cell line. BeWo selected parasites revealed a multi-phenotypic adhesion population expressing multiple var genes. However, these parasites did not cytoadhere specifically to the syncytiotrophoblast lining of placental cryosections and were not recognized by sera from malaria-exposed women in a parity dependent manner, indicating that the surface molecules present on the surface of the BeWo selected population are not specifically expressed during the course of pregnancy-associated malaria. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the placental malaria associated phenotype can not be restored in FCR3delta var2csa mutant parasites and highlight the key role of var2CSA in pregnancy malaria pathogenesis and for vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W2064196828,"NF-κB signaling has been implicated in neurodegenerative disease, epilepsy, and neuronal plasticity. However, the cellular and molecular activity of NF-κB signaling within the nervous system remains to be clearly defined. Here, we show that the NF-κB and IκB homologs Dorsal and Cactus surround postsynaptic glutamate receptor (GluR) clusters at the Drosophila NMJ. We then show that mutations in dorsal, cactus, and IRAK/pelle kinase specifically impair GluR levels, assayed immunohistochemically and electrophysiologically, without affecting NMJ growth, the size of the postsynaptic density, or homeostatic plasticity. Additional genetic experiments support the conclusion that cactus functions in concert with, rather than in opposition to, dorsal and pelle in this process. Finally, we provide evidence that Dorsal and Cactus act posttranscriptionally, outside the nucleus, to control GluR density. Based upon our data we speculate that Dorsal, Cactus, and Pelle could function together, locally at the postsynaptic density, to specify GluR levels.

NF-κB is the founding member of a highly conserved family of Rel-homology domain containing transcription factors that have been ascribed diverse functions ranging from immunity and host defense to apoptosis, embryonic patterning and neural plasticity (Ghosh et al., 1998Ghosh S.

Physiological functions for brain NF-kappaB.Trends Neurosci. 2005; 28: 37-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The NF-κB transcription factor is embedded within a signaling cascade that conveys receptor signaling at the cell surface to NF-κB-dependent gene regulation in the cell nucleus. At the heart of the NF-κB signaling system is a core group of proteins that control NF-κB activity including the IκB/Cactus family of inhibitory molecules and the IRAK/Pelle protein kinase. The basic organization of NF-κB signaling is conserved from fly to human (Ghosh et al., 1998Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. NF-kappa B and Rel proteins: evolutionarily conserved mediators of immune responses.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4455) Google Scholar). Signaling is induced by ligand binding to cell surface receptors such as the Toll-like receptors involved in recognition of microbes, antigen receptors (B cell and T cell receptors), and cytokine receptors such as the TNF-α superfamily receptors (Baker and Reddy, 1998Baker S.J. Reddy E.P. Modulation of life and death by the TNF receptor superfamily.Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3261-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). In general, receptor activation initiates receptor-associated intracellular signaling, including activation of IRAK/Pelle kinase, followed by phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκB/Cactus (Hacker and Karin, 2006Hacker H. Karin M. Regulation and function of IKK and IKK-related kinases.Sci. STKE. 2006; 2006: re13Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). In the absence of signaling, IκB/Cactus binds and sequesters cytoplasmic NF-κB. In response to signaling activation, the degradation of IκB/Cactus releases NF-κB/Dorsal into the cytoplasm allowing it to translocate into the cell nucleus where it functions as a transcriptional regulator capable of increasing or decreasing target gene transcription. Although NF-κB has been studied intensively in the context of immunity, inflammation, and cancer, far less is understood about the function of NF-κB in the nervous system. NF-κB is highly expressed in both the vertebrate and invertebrate central and peripheral nervous systems. The function of NF-κB in the vertebrate central nervous system can be divided into two categories. In the first category, NF-κB is thought to regulate processes related to disease and injury. For example, NF-κB has been implicated in the cellular response to brain injury, seizure, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's (Mattson and Camandola, 2001Mattson M.P. Camandola S. NF-kappaB in neuronal plasticity and neurodegenerative disorders.J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, Mattson et al., 2000aMattson M.P. Culmsee C. Yu Z. Camandola S. Roles of nuclear factor kappaB in neuronal survival and plasticity.J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 443-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Additional related functions could include the regulation of cellular anti-oxidation and neuronal apoptosis (Mattson and Camandola, 2001Mattson M.P. Camandola S. NF-kappaB in neuronal plasticity and neurodegenerative disorders.J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Second, NF-κB has been suggested to function during neural development and synaptic plasticity (Meffert and Baltimore, 2005Meffert M.K. Baltimore D. Physiological functions for brain NF-kappaB.Trends Neurosci. 2005; 28: 37-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, Meffert et al., 2003Meffert M.K. Chang J.M.

NF-kappaB activity in transgenic mice: developmental regulation and tissue specificity.Development. 1996; 122: 2117-2128PubMed Google Scholar). For example, NF-κB knockout mice have behavioral learning deficits (Meffert et al., 2003Meffert M.K. Chang J.M. Wiltgen B.J. Fanselow M.S. Baltimore D. NF-kappa B functions in synaptic signaling and behavior.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 1072-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) and NF-κB has been suggested to play a role in the mechanisms of long-term synaptic plasticity (Albensi and Mattson; Mattson and Camandola, 2001Mattson M.P.

Biol. 2006; 26: 7283-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). NF-κB is also highly expressed at the vertebrate and invertebrate neuromuscular junctions (Baghdiguian et al., 1999Baghdiguian S. Martin M. Richard I. Pons F. Astier C. Bourg N. Hay R.T. Chemaly R. Halaby G. Loiselet J. et al.Calpain 3 deficiency is associated with myonuclear apoptosis and profound perturbation of the IkappaB alpha/NF-kappaB pathway in limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A.Nat.

Muscles and innveravtion are affected by loss of Dorsal in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). At the vertebrate NMJ, activation of NF-κB has been implicated in mechanisms of muscle wasting associated with disease (dystrophies and cachexia) and denervation (Cai et al., 2004Cai D. Frantz J.D. Tawa Jr., N.E. Melendez P.A. Oh B.C. Lidov H.G. Hasselgren P.O. Frontera W.R. Lee J. Glass D.J. Shoelson S.E.

NF-kappaB-induced loss of MyoD messenger RNA: possible role in muscle decay and cachexia.Science. 2000; 289: 2363-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). In these studies, enhanced NF-κB signaling has been shown to be deleterious. However, in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, the function of endogenous NF-κB is not well understood. To date, studies of NF-κB signaling in the nervous system have highlighted a transcriptional function for NF-κB signaling that is consistent with the known activity of this signaling pathway in other systems. Core components of the NF-κB signaling system are present both pre- and postsynaptically and it is hypothesized that NF-κB/Dorsal can translocate from the synapse to the neuronal nucleus to control gene expression (Albensi and Mattson; Furukawa and Mattson, 1998Furukawa K. Mattson M.P. The transcription factor NF-kappaB mediates increases in calcium currents and decreases in NMDA- and AMPA/kainate-induced currents induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha in hippocampal neurons.J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1876-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, Meffert and Baltimore, 2005Meffert M.K. Baltimore D. Physiological functions for brain NF-kappaB.Trends Neurosci. 2005; 28: 37-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, Meffert et al., 2003Meffert M.K. Chang J.M. Wiltgen B.J. Fanselow M.S. Baltimore D. NF-kappa B functions in synaptic signaling and behavior.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 1072-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that NF-κB could also function locally at the synapse (Meffert and Baltimore, 2005Meffert M.K. Baltimore D. Physiological functions for brain NF-kappaB.Trends Neurosci. 2005; 28: 37-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). However, despite being an attractive hypothesis, direct experimental evidence in favor of a local synaptic function for NF-κB has yet to be defined. We have performed a genetic analysis of NF-κB signaling at the Drosophila NMJ and provide evidence that NF-κB/Dorsal, IκB/Cactus and IRAK/Pelle are necessary to control glutamate receptor density at the postsynaptic muscle membrane. Remarkably, we failed to find evidence in support of a nuclear function of NF-κB/Dorsal. Rather, our data suggest that NF-κB/Dorsal, IκB/Cactus and IRAK/Pelle function locally, at the postsynaptic NMJ to specify GluR density. It was previously shown that NF-κB/Dorsal and IκB/Cactus are present postsynaptically at the Drosophila NMJ (Cantera et al., 1999aCantera R. Kozlova T. Barillas-Mury C. Kafatos F.C. Muscles and innveravtion are affected by loss of Dorsal in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We have confirmed and extended this finding. First, we demonstrate the specificity of the Cactus and Dorsal antibodies at the NMJ (Gillespie and Wasserman, 1994Gillespie S.K. Wasserman S.A. Dorsal, a Drosophila Rel-like protein, is phosphorylated upon activation of the transmembrane protein Toll.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3559-3568Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, Reach et al., 1996Reach M. Galindo R.L. Towb P. Allen J.L. Karin M. Wasserman S.A. A gradient of Cactus protein degradation establishes dorsoventral polarity in the Drosophila embryo.Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar; see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Next, we show that Dorsal immunoreactivity surrounds presynaptic markers that delineate the neuronal membrane (anti-HRP) and define the presynaptic vesicle pool (anti-synapsin) (Figures 1A–1F). In addition, Dorsal staining is absent from presynaptic axons just prior to entry into the muscle field, indicating that Dorsal protein is absent from the presynaptic motor axons (Figures 1D–1F, arrow). A similar analysis demonstrates that Cactus, like Dorsal, is localized postsynaptically and is absent from presynaptic axons prior to muscle innervation (Figure S1, arrow, and data not shown). Interestingly, 3D confocal imaging of synaptic boutons at the third instar NMJ demonstrates that Cactus immunoreactivity surrounds postsynaptic GluR clusters within the muscle (Figures 1G–1I). Dorsal immunoreactivity shows a similar distribution and both Cactus and Dorsal colocalize with an independent postsynaptic marker Discs-Large (Dlg) (data not shown). Based on these data and data from previously published reports (Cantera et al., 1999aCantera R. Kozlova T. Barillas-Mury C. Kafatos F.C. Muscles and innveravtion are affected by loss of Dorsal in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we conclude that Dorsal and Cactus are concentrated within the same postsynaptic domain surrounding the GluR clusters. This is in contrast to the general cytoplasmic localization of these proteins in other cell types. In addition, consistent with another report (Cantera et al., 1999bCantera R. Roos E. Engstrom Y. DIF and Cactus are colocalized in the larval nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster.J. Neurobiol. 1999; 38: 16-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we find no evidence for expression of either Dif or Relish, two additional Rel homology domain transcription factors, at the Drosophila NMJ (data not shown). To study the function of Dorsal at the NMJ, we have taken advantage of a series of mutations that have been previously shown to disrupt the dorsal gene during embryonic patterning and innate immunity (Table 1). Importantly, homozygous dorsal mutants derived from heterozygous females have sufficient quantities of maternally supplied Dorsal protein to allow for normal embryonic development. This allows us to analyze the function of dorsal mutations during larval development.Table 1Molecular Characterization of dorsal, pelle, and cactus AllelesAlleleDescriptionMolecular LesionReferencesDorsaldlHProtein nullX-ray rearrangementRoth et al., 1989Roth S.

All dorsal mutations analyzed in this study, including null mutant combinations, survive as healthy, normally sized third-instar animals. We quantified bouton numbers at the NMJ of muscles 6 and 7 as done previously (Eaton and Davis, 2005Eaton B.A. Davis G.W. LIM Kinase1 controls synaptic stability downstream of the type II BMP receptor.Neuron. 2005; 47: 695-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Bouton numbers are normal in a dorsal trans-heterozygous zygotic null mutant combination (dorsal1/dorsalH) and in a second trans-heterozygous mutant combination (dorsal2/doralH) compared to wild-type controls (wild-type = 100 ± 7.8, n = 19; dl1/dlH = 109 ± 6.3, n = 28; dl2/dlH = 98 ± 6.7, n = 17; data represent % wild-type bouton number on muscles 6/7). In the vertebrate nervous system, NF-κB signaling has been implicated in forms of neuronal plasticity that are typically associated with changes in the abundance of postsynaptic GluRs (Furukawa and Mattson, 1998Furukawa K. Mattson M.P. The transcription factor NF-kappaB mediates increases in calcium currents and decreases in NMDA- and AMPA/kainate-induced currents induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha in hippocampal neurons.J.

Greene W.C. NF-kappaB/Rel regulates inhibitory and excitatory neuronal function and synaptic plasticity.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 7283-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assayed GluR abundance at the NMJ of dorsal mutant animals. To do so, we quantified the fluorescence intensity of GluRs at the NMJ using previously published methodology (Albin and Davis, 2004Albin S.D. Davis G.W. Coordinating structural and functional synapse development: postsynaptic p21-activated kinase independently specifies glutamate receptor abundance and postsynaptic morphology.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6871-6879Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). GluRIIA levels are significantly decreased in dorsal null mutant animals (dl1/dlH) compared to wild-type and heterozygous controls (Figure 2). A similar decrease in GluRIIA levels is also observed in a second strong loss-of-function dorsal mutant, dlPZ/dlPZ (Figure 2; Table 1; Isoda et al., 1992Isoda K. Roth S. Nusslein-Volhard C. The functional domains of the Drosophila morphogen dorsal: evidence from the analysis of mutants.Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, Norris and Manley, 1992Norris J.L. Manley J.L. Selective nuclear transport of the Drosophila morphogen dorsal can be established by a signaling pathway involving the transmembrane protein Toll and protein kinase A.Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1654-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Next, we expressed UAS-dorsal-RNAi specifically in muscle. Dorsal protein levels, assayed by synaptic immunostaining, were decreased to 38% ± 3.4% (n = 8) of control levels demonstrating a significant protein knockdown in muscle. In these animals, we find a statistically significant decrease in GluRIIA levels (66% ± 4.8% of wild-type GluRIIA levels; n = 8, p < 0.001 compared to control). These data support the conclusion that dorsal is required in muscle for normal GluRIIA abundance. Finally, overexpression of dorsal in muscle did not change GluRIIA levels compared to wild-type indicating that increased Dorsal protein levels are not sufficient to enhance GluRIIA abundance beyond that observed in wild-type (Figure 2D). In all experiments, the level of a control antigen, anti-HRP, did not consistently differ between genotypes (Figure 2E). Additionally, we find a small but statistically significant change in Dlg levels (wild-type = 100 ± 0.9, n = 19; dl1/dlH = 93+/− 0.9, n = 18, p < 0.05, data represent % wild-type synaptic anti-DLG fluorescence). The change in synaptic Dlg is far less than that observed in other mutations that control postsynaptic morphology, suggesting that Dorsal is primarily required for normal GluR abundance (Albin and Davis, 2004Albin S.D. Davis G.W. Coordinating structural and functional synapse development: postsynaptic p21-activated kinase independently specifies glutamate receptor abundance and postsynaptic morphology.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6871-6879Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Next, we took advantage of existing mutations to examine the domain requirements of Dorsal/NF-κB for the regulation of GluR abundance. All NF-κB family members contain a highly conserved Rel-homology domain (RHD). The RHD of Dorsal mediates signal-dependent phosphorylation, homodimerization, DNA binding, nuclear localization, as well as interaction with other NF-κB signaling proteins such as Cactus and Pelle (Ghosh et al., 1998Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. NF-kappa B and Rel proteins: evolutionarily conserved mediators of immune responses.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4455) Google Scholar, Govind, 1999Govind S. Control of development and immunity by rel transcription factors in Drosophila.Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6875-6887Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, Isoda et al., 1992Isoda K. Roth S. Nusslein-Volhard C. The functional domains of the Drosophila morphogen dorsal: evidence from the analysis of mutants.Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The dorsal2 allele (dl2) harbors a point mutation that specifically disrupts the RHD (Figure 3E; Table 1). Mutant Dorsal protein in the dl2 background remains concentrated at the NMJ (Figure 3F). Quantification of GluRIIA fluorescent intensity demonstrates that GluRIIA levels are strongly reduced in the dl2 mutant (Figures 2B and 2D; p < 0.001 compared to WT). Surprisingly, we also observe a significant decrease in GluRIIA levels in the dl2/+ heterozygous animal (Figure 2D). Since the heterozygous null mutations show normal GluRIIA levels (dlH/+; Figure 2D), our data demonstrate that the dl2 mutation acts in a dominant-negative manner to impair GluR abundance. This is consistent with Dorsal functioning as part of a protein complex that controls GluR levels. Dorsal also contains a transactivation domain (Figure 3E) that mediates interactions between Dorsal and nuclear cofactors that are required for Dorsal-dependent transcriptional regulation (Flores-Saaib et al., 2001Flores-Saaib R.D. Jia S. Courey A.J. Activation and repression by the C-terminal domain of Dorsal.Development. 2001; 128: 1869-1879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Isoda et al., 1992Isoda K. Roth S. Nusslein-Volhard C. The functional domains of the Drosophila morphogen dorsal: evidence from the analysis of mutants.Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The dlU5 mutation truncates the transactivation domain and disrupts Dorsal-dependent transcriptional regulation in the embryo (Isoda et al., 1992Isoda K. Roth S. Nusslein-Volhard C. The functional domains of the Drosophila morphogen dorsal: evidence from the analysis of mutants.Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). First, we demonstrate that mutant protein remains at the NMJ in dlU5 animals (Figures 3C and 3F). However, unlike dl2 mutants, GluRIIA levels are not decreased in dlU5 mutants (indeed there is a statistically significant increase in abundance compared to wild-type, p < 0.05; Figures 3A–3D and 3G). These data are surprising since both the dl2 and dlU5 mutations cause mutant phenotypes in embryonic patterning consistent with disrupted Dorsal-mediated transcription (Isoda et al., 1992Isoda K. Roth S. Nusslein-Volhard C. The functional domains of the Drosophila morphogen dorsal: evidence from the analysis of mutants.Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). At a minimum, our data demonstrate that mutation of protein domains necessary for Dorsal-dependent transcription in the embryo do not always correlate with decreased GluR abundance. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that there are other mechanisms of Dorsal-mediated transactivation in the context of the larval NMJ. To determine whether the observed changes in receptor abundance correlate with altered synaptic efficacy, we performed an electrophysiological analysis of synaptic function in dorsal mutants. We find a significant reduction in the average amplitude of spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic amplitudes (mEPSP) in the dorsal null mutation (dl1/dl1) compared to wild-type (Figures 4A, 4B, and 4G). Importantly, there was no change in the average resting membrane potential or the average muscle input resistance (Figures 4C and 4D). Similar observations were made for a separate allele (dlPZ/dlPZ; data not shown). Thus, the observed decrease in GluR abundance assayed by fluorescence microscopy is correlated with decreased GluR sensitivity assayed electrophysiologically. At least five different subunits can contribute to the composition of multimeric GluR complexes at the Drosophila NMJ (Featherstone et al., 2005Featherstone D.E. Rushton E. Rohrhough J. Liebl F.

Although it is evident that the earliest developmental stages have large effects on fitness, other developmental stages, such as the period when secondary sexual characters develop, might also exert a profound effect on fitness components. Here we show experimentally in male zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, that nutritional conditions during this later period have immediate effects on male plumage ornaments and on their attractiveness as adults. Males that had received high quality food during the second month of life, a period when secondary sexual characteristics develop, were significantly more attractive as adults in mate choice tests than siblings supplied with standard food during this period. Preferred males that had experienced better nutritional conditions had larger orange cheek patches when nutritional treatments ended than did unpreferred males. Sexual plumage ornaments of young males thus are honest indicators of nutritional conditions during this period. The mate choice tests with adult birds indicate that nutritional conditions during the period of song learning, brain and gonad development, and moult into adult plumage have persisting effects on male attractiveness. This suggests that the developmental period following nutritional dependence from the parents is just as important in affecting adult attractiveness as are much earlier developmental periods. These findings thus contribute to understanding the origin and consequences of environmentally determined fitness components."
https://openalex.org/W2093789041,"Predicting RNA secondary structure is often the first step to determining the structure of RNA. Prediction approaches have historically avoided searching for pseudoknots because of the extreme combinatorial and time complexity of the problem. Yet neglecting pseudoknots limits the utility of such approaches. Here, an algorithm utilizing structure mapping and thermodynamics is introduced for RNA pseudoknot prediction that finds the minimum free energy and identifies information about the flexibility of the RNA. The heuristic approach takes advantage of the 5' to 3' folding direction of many biological RNA molecules and is consistent with the hierarchical folding hypothesis and the contact order model. Mapping methods are used to build and analyze the folded structure for pseudoknots and to add important 3D structural considerations. The program can predict some well known pseudoknot structures correctly. The results of this study suggest that many functional RNA sequences are optimized for proper folding. They also suggest directions we can proceed in the future to achieve even better results."
https://openalex.org/W1992495580,"High-grade glioma cells express subunits of the ENaC/Deg superfamily, including members of ASIC subfamily. Our previous work has shown that glioma cells exhibit a basally active cation current, which is not present in low-grade tumor cells or normal astrocytes, and that can be blocked by amiloride. When ASIC2 is present within the channel complex in the plasma membrane, the channel is rendered non-functional because of inherent negative effectors that require ASIC2. We have previously shown that high-grade glioma cells functionally express this current because of the lack of ASIC2 in the plasma membrane. We now hypothesize that ASIC2 trafficking in glioma cells is regulated by a specific chaperone protein, namely Hsc70. Our results demonstrated that Hsc70 co-immunoprecipitates with ASIC2 and that it is overexpressed in glioma cells as compared with normal astrocytes. In contrast, there was no difference in the expression of calnexin, which also co-immunoprecipitates with ASIC2. In addition, glycerol and sodium 4-phenylbutyrate reduced the amount of Hsc70 expressed in glioma cells to levels found in normal astrocytes. Transfection of Hsc70 siRNA inhibited the constitutively activated amiloride-sensitive current, decreased migration, and increased ASIC2 surface expression in glioma cells. These results support an association between Hsc70 and ASIC2 that may underlie the increased retention of ASIC2 in the endoplasmic reticulum of glioma cells. The data also suggest that decreasing Hsc70 expression promotes reversion of a high-grade glioma cell to a more normal astrocytic phenotype.

These tumors arise either from astrocytes or their progenitor cells (1Maher E.A. Furnari F.B. Bachoo R.M. Rowitch D.H. Louis D.N. Cavenee W.K. DePinho R.A. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1311-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). Gliomas have escaped most normal cell growth and cell death control mechanisms. In addition, GBMs possess an astounding ability to invade normal brain parenchyma over very long distances (2Giese A. Acta Neurochir. 2003; 88: 153-162Google Scholar). Our laboratory has proposed that members of the epithelial Na+ channel and degenerin (ENaC/Deg) superfamily are important in the pathophysiology of high-grade, astrocyte-derived brain tumors, as we have found that cells derived from high-grade gliomas express a basally active, cation-selective current that is sensitive to amiloride. ENaC/Deg family members include the ASIC (acid-sensing ion channels) subfamily. We postulated that the glioma cation current is mediated by mixed ASIC and ENaC components, including ASIC2 (3Berdiev B.K. Xia J. McLean L.A. Markert J.M. Gillespie G.Y. Mapstone T.B. Naren A.P.

The constitutive amiloride-sensitive cation channel activity is a specific feature of high-grade gliomas. In normal human astrocytes, no amiloride-sensitive current can be recorded, although we have shown that ASIC and ENaC subunits are expressed.In our search for the key difference between glioma cells and normal astrocytes, we have previously shown that the increased current in gliomas is due to the loss of plasma membrane expression of ASIC2 (4Vila-Carriles W.H.

This failure in plasma membrane ASIC2 expression is manifested either as an absence in mRNA for ASIC2, because we can only detect ASIC2 mRNA in ∼50% of the glioma cell lines/tissue that we have examined or as a failure in trafficking of this subunit to its correct functional location in the plasma membrane, as ASIC2 protein can be detected in whole cell lysates, but is not found at the plasma membrane (4Vila-Carriles W.H.

Therefore, the objective of this work was to understand and define the pathways that regulate ASIC2 trafficking, and why it is dysfunctional in gliomas.Our recent studies showed that addition of the chemical chaperone, glycerol, or the transcriptional regulator, sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (4PB), results in increased surface expression of ASIC2, a reduction in cell migration and proliferation, and loss of the amiloride-sensitive current in the glioma cell (4Vila-Carriles W.H. Kovacs G.G. Jovov B. Zhou Z.H. Pahwa A.K. Colby G. Esimai O. Gillespie G.Y. Mapstone T.B. Markert J.M. Fuller C.M. Bubien J.K. Benos D.J. J. Biol.

These data supported our previous hypothesis that a failure of ASIC2 to traffic to the surface underlies the constitutively active cation current in glioma cells and contributes to the increased proliferation and migration characteristic of the glioma cell phenotype.Previous studies of CFTR trafficking showed that glycerol and 4PB could rescue misfolded ΔF508-CFTR and deliver it to the membrane (5Rubenstein R.C. Zeitlin P.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C259-C267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Zeitlin P.L. Diener-West M. Rubenstein R.C. Boyle M.P. Lee C.K. Brass-Ernst L. Mol. Ther. 2002; 6: 119-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies revealed that the rescue effected by 4PB was due to down-regulation of the molecular chaperone, heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70) (5Rubenstein R.C. Zeitlin P.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C259-C267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Rubenstein R.C. Lyons B.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L43-L51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The data suggested that 4PB improves trafficking of ΔF508-CFTR by allowing it to escape association with Hsc70.Hsc70 resides in the nucleus and cytosol and is released as the proteins achieve their native conformation. Hsc70 remains attached to misfolded proteins where it can recruit the ubiquitin ligase CHIP, to facilitate proteasome-mediated degradation. Hsc70 overexpression causes a prolonged association with the client proteins and promotes their ubiquitination and degradation (8Bercovich B. Stancovski I. Mayer A. Blumenfeld N. Laszlo A. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9002-9010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Hsc70 binds directly to membrane channel proteins such as K+ channels and CFTR, and mediates their trafficking via multiple steps, including intracellular transport, endocytosis, and exocytosis (9Meacham G.C.

Our results demonstrated that down-regulation of Hsc70 is associated with increased delivery of ASIC2 to the cell surface, decreased glioma cell migration, and loss of the constitutively active amiloride-sensitive cation current.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Primary cultures of normal human astrocytes, primary cultured human glioblastoma cells (GBM), and U251-MG cells were obtained from the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Neurosurgery Brain Tissue Bank (Institutional Review Board approval X030403011). U87-MG cells were purchased from ATCC. SK-MG and D54-MG cells were gifts from Dr. Gregory Cairncross, University of Calgary, and Dr. Darell Bigner, Duke University, respectively. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 95% O2 and 5% CO2 humidified incubator.Transient Transfections—Glioblastoma cell lines were either transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen) for 48 h following the manufacturer's instructions or electroporated using the Electroporation Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) and the following parameters: cuvette gap 0.4 cm, voltage 0.3 kV, time constant 35 ms, and capacitor 960 μF. D54-MG and GBM cells were transfected with an annealed pre-designed siRNA targeting the human Hsc70 gene, HSPA8 (heat shock protein A8), with the following sequence: 5′-CCUAAAUUCGUAGCAAAUU-3′, or a customized scrambled siRNA, 5′-CACUAAUUGCAUCGAUAUA-3′ (Ambion) at a final concentration of 100 nm. Normal human astrocytes were transfected with an annealed pre-designed siRNA targeting the human ASIC2 gene, ACCN1 (amiloride-sensitive cation channel 1), with the following sequence: 5′-GCUCUCAAUUAUGAGACAA-3′, or a customized scrambled siRNA, 5′-AAAUUUAAGGGCCUUCCAA-3′ (Ambion) at a final concentration of 100 nm.Antibodies, Immunoprecipitation, SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis, and Western Blots—Rabbit anti-ASIC1 antibody raised against the peptide sequence DVKRHNPCESL-RGHP or the rabbit anti-ASIC2 antibody (Alomone) were used for immunoprecipitation. The rat anti-Hsc70 monoclonal (1B5) antibody, mouse anti-actin monoclonal antibody (Abcam), rabbit anti-calnexin polyclonal antibody, rabbit anti-Grp78 polyclonal antibody, rat anti-Grp94 monoclonal antibody, mouse anti-Hsp70 monoclonal antibody, and mouse anti-Hsp90 monoclonal antibody (Stressgen) were used for Western blot detection. Briefly, for immunoprecipitation, 100-mm plates of confluent normal astrocytes, GBM, and glioblastoma cell lines were washed twice with PBS (138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm MgCl, and 0.1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4). The cells were then lysed with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS supplemented with Complete Protease Inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The lysate was placed into microcen-trifuge tubes and sheared with a 23-gauge needle. 500 μg of supernatant from the lysate after centrifugation (15,800 × g for 20 min at 4 °C) was incubated with 2 μg of the corresponding antibody overnight at 4 °C on a rotator, followed by the addition of 50 μl of protein A-agarose beads. Beads were washed with PBS and pelleted five times. Samples were resuspended 1:1 (v/v) with Laemmli sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 25% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 5% β-mercaptoethanol) and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Specificity of the antibodies for immunoprecipitation was demonstrated by substitution of ChromoPure non-immune IgGs (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for the primary antibodies. Standard electrophoresis and blotting protocols were followed. Briefly, proteins were run on 8% SDS-PAGE mini-gels with 4% stacking gels. Gels were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Blots were blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk/Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C and probed with the appropriate antibody in Tris-buffered saline-Tween-20 for 1 h. After washing, blots were reacted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and visualized using chemiluminescent reagents (Super Signal West Pico, Pierce) imaged onto Kodak X-Omat AR film. Gel analysis was done by obtaining the integrated density of each band using the Eagle Sight software (Stratagene).Plasma Membrane Preparation—D54-MG cells were seeded in 100-mm culture dishes and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 48 h with either Hsc70 siRNA or scrambled Hsc70 siRNA. Cells were scraped and collected by centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. A plasma membrane protein extraction kit (BioVision) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol to isolate specifically the plasma membrane from the total cellular membranes. We have previously shown that this method results in a glial membrane fraction enriched in plasma membrane markers (4Vila-Carriles W.H. Kovacs G.G. Jovov B. Zhou Z.H. Pahwa A.K. Colby G. Esimai O. Gillespie G.Y. Mapstone T.B. Markert J.M. Fuller C.M. Bubien J.K. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19220-19232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The plasma membrane fraction was dissolved in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS and plasma membrane protein concentration was measured using the BCA protein assay (Pierce).Whole Cell Patch Clamp—GBM or D54-MG cells were electroporated with either Hsc70 or scrambled Hsc70 siRNA. Normal human astrocytes were electroporated with ASIC2 siRNA or scrambled ASIC2 siRNA for 48 h. Cells were placed in a chamber filled with RPMI 1640 culture medium (133 mm Na+, 5.3 mm K+, and 108.3 mm Cl−) and mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope. Once the cells adhered to the glass bottom of the chamber, micropipettes connected to an Axon 200A patch clamp amplifier and filled with an electrolyte solution containing (in mm) 100 K-gluconate, 30 KCl, 10 NaCl, 20 HEPES, 0.5 EGTA, <10 free Ca2+, and 4 ATP at pH 7.2 were abutted against the plasma membrane of individual cells. For whole cell patch clamping of normal human astrocytes, 100 nm LY379196 (Eli Lilly Research Laboratories), a PKCβ inhibitor, was added to the pipette solution. Giga-ohm resistance seals between the pipette tips and the cells were obtained by applying suction to the pipettes. Once the pipette tips were sealed to the cells, a sharp suction pulse was applied to rupture the membrane within the sealed area, leaving the seal intact. This procedure produced a low resistance electrical connection to the cellular interior. Once the whole cell configuration had been achieved, the stability of each preparation was monitored between voltage clamp protocols and during drug superfusions by clamping the membrane to positive and negative potentials continuously. The cells were held at a membrane potential of -60 mV and clamped sequentially for 800 ms each to membrane potentials of -160 to +40 mV at intervals of 20 mV, returning to the holding potential of -60 mV for 800 ms between each test voltage. The continuous monitoring shows, in real time, the effects of inhibitors, such as amiloride, and acts as a quality control for the stability of the preparations. The currents were recorded digitally and filed in real time using the pCLAMP 6 software (Axon Instruments). Each recording under a given experimental condition was done on at least three different cells.FluoroBlock Migration Assay—D54-MG cells and normal human astrocytes were seeded in 100-mm culture dishes and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with 1 μg of pCMV-eGFP and either Hsc70 or ASIC2 siRNA, scrambled Hsc70, or ASIC2 siRNA for 48 h prior to FluoroBlock migration assay. Transfection efficiency was determined by GFP expression before the cells were harvested. The average transfection efficiency was ∼30% in all experiments. Filters were coated overnight with 5 μg/ml vitronectin (BIOSOURCE) in PBS 24 h before the assay. HTS FluoroBlock™ inserts (BD Falcon Lab-ware) contain fluorescence blocking PET track-etched membranes with 8-μm pores. This migration assay allows for real-time viewing of cell migration without the need to end the experiment and process the membranes. The FluoroBlock membrane prevents the transmission of light to cells on top of the membrane, thus only GFP-expressing cells migrating through the vitronectin-coated membrane can be viewed. Briefly, cells were lifted from their culture dishes, pelleted, and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium with 1% bovine serum albumin. 150,000 cells were added to the upper chamber. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. LY379196 (100 nM) was added to the normal human astrocyte medium. GFP-expressing cells that had migrated through the pores to the lower side of the filter were counted in five random fields per filter using a Nikon TE200V microscope equipped for epifluorescence. Three filters equal an n of 1. This experiment was repeated three times.RESULTSAssociation between ASICs and Chaperone Proteins—We have previously shown that glioma cells exhibit a basally active cation current because trafficking of ASIC2, but not ASIC1, to the membrane is compromised (4Vila-Carriles W.H. Kovacs G.G. Jovov B. Zhou Z.H. Pahwa A.K. Colby G. Esimai O. Gillespie G.Y. Mapstone T.B. Markert J.M. Fuller C.M. Bubien J.K. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19220-19232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). ASIC1 and ASIC2 are closely related proteins that exhibit an overall identity of 68% (14Garcia-Anoveros J. Derfler B. Neville-Golden J. Hyman B.T. Corey D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1459-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Therefore, we needed to determine whether any chaperone proteins specifically interacted with ASIC2 but not ASIC1. Fig. 1 shows that chaperones exhibit varying specificities for both ASIC1 and ASIC2. Whereas Grp78 and calnexin interact with both ASIC subunits (Fig. 1C), Grp94 and Hsp90 appear to interact preferentially with ASIC1 (Fig. 1A). Importantly, only ASIC2 co-immunoprecipitated Hsc70; this chaperone does not seem to bind to ASIC1 (Fig. 1B). Somewhat surprisingly, Hsp70 did not co-precipitate with either ASIC1 or ASIC2 (Fig. 1D).Hsc70 Is Overexpressed in Glioma Cells—Because ASIC2 specifically co-immunoprecipitated with Hsc70, we studied Hsc70 expression in glioma cells compared with normal astrocytes. Semiquantitative immunoblotting of lysates from glioma cell lines, GBM cells maintained in primary culture, and normal astrocytes using rat anti-Hsc70 and mouse anti-actin antibodies were done. The ratio of Hsc70 density to actin showed that Hsc70 is overexpressed in glioma and primary GBM cells as compared with normal astrocytes (Fig. 2A). In contrast, levels of an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone, calnexin, are similar in all cell types (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Hsc70 is overexpressed in glioma cells. A, immunoblot showing increased expression of Hsc70 in glioma cells as compared with normal astrocytes. 50 μg of cell lysate were immunoblotted with rat anti-Hsc70 and mouse anti-actin antibodies.

Lyons B.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L43-L51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If this also occurs in glioma cells, we should be able to detect this effect in immunoblots of Hsc70. Therefore, immunoblotting of normal astrocytes, primary cultures of GBM, and D54-MG cells following 48 h incubation with 5 mm 4PB and 500 mm glycerol were done. The ratio of Hsc70 density to actin showed that Hsc70 expression was markedly decreased by 4PB and glycerol. In contrast, levels of calnexin were not affected by either of these drugs (Fig. 3A). We have previously shown that 4PB and glycerol increase ASIC2 trafficking to the membrane and inhibit the constitutive current of glioma cells (4Vila-Carriles W.H. Kovacs G.G. Jovov B. Zhou Z.H. Pahwa A.K. Colby G. Esimai O. Gillespie G.Y. Mapstone T.B. Markert J.M. Fuller C.M. Bubien J.K. Benos D.J. J. Biol.

Thus, immunoprecipitation with anti-ASIC2 antibody and immunoblotting with anti-Hsc70 antibody of normal astrocytes, D54-MG cells, and primary cultures of GBM cells following 48 h incubation with 5 mm 4PB and 500 mm glycerol were done. Incubation with 4PB and glycerol reduced the amount of Hsc70 that was detected following co-immunoprecipitation with anti-ASIC2 (Fig. 3B). In both D54-MG cells and in the primary GBM cells, the extent of ASIC2/Hsc70 interaction in the presence of 4PB and glycerol was decreased to similar levels found in normal astrocytes.FIGURE 34PB and glycerol decrease expression of Hsc70 in D54-MG and GBM cells to the same level as that seen in normal astrocytes without affecting expression of calnexin. A, immunoblotting with rabbit anti-calnexin (top panels) or rat anti-Hsc70 (bottom panels) and mouse anti-actin antibodies were done with 50 μg of cell lysate. On the left, lane 1, D54-MG; lane 2, normal astrocytes; lane 3, D54-MG treated with 5 mm 4PB; lane 4, D54-MG treated with 500 mm glycerol.

We wanted to test the hypothesis that the specific inhibition of Hsc70 expression would increase plasma membrane expression of ASIC2 and inhibit the amiloride-sensitive current as well as glioma cell migration. Thus, D54-MG and primary GBM cells were transfected with Hsc70 siRNA, and a scrambled Hsc70 siRNA as a negative control, and immunoblotted with rat anti-Hsc70 antibody and mouse anti-actin antibody. Hsc70 siRNA markedly reduced expression of Hsc70 protein, whereas the scrambled Hsc70 control siRNA had no effect (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Hsc70 siRNA in glioma cells.

https://openalex.org/W2047288355,"The serine and cysteine proteases SspA and SspB of Staphylococcus aureus are secreted as inactive zymogens, zSspA and zSspB. Mature SspA is a trypsin-like glutamyl endopeptidase and is required to activate zSspB. Although a metalloprotease Aureolysin (Aur) is in turn thought to contribute to activation of zSspA, a specific role has not been demonstrated. We found that pre-zSspA is processed by signal peptidase at ANA29 ↓, releasing a Leu30 isoform that is first processed exclusively through autocatalytic intramolecular cleavage within a glutamine-rich propeptide segment, 40QQTQSSKQQTPKIQ53. The preferred site is Gln43 with secondary processing at Gln47 and Gln53. This initial processing is necessary for optimal and subsequent Aur-dependent processing at Leu58 and then Val69 to release mature SspA. Although processing by Aur is rate-limiting in zSspA activation, the first active molecules of Val69SspA promote rapid intermolecular processing of remaining zSspA at Glu65, producing an N-terminal 66HANVILP isoform that is inactive until removal of the HAN tripeptide by Aur. Modeling indicated that His66 of this penultimate isoform blocks the active site by hydrogen bonding to Ser237 and occlusion of substrate. Binding of glutamate within the active site of zSspA is energetically unfavorable, but glutamine fits into the primary specificity pocket and is predicted to hydrogen bond to Thr232 proximal to Ser237, permitting autocatalytic cleavage of the glutamine-rich propeptide segment. These and other observations suggest that zSspA is activated through a trypsinogen-like mechanism where supplementary features of the propeptide must be sequentially processed in the correct order to allow efficient activation.

Staphylococcus aureus can colonize and infect virtually every tissue and organ system of the body (1Archer G.L. Clin. Infect.

A key factor in these defining traits is its ability to sustain bacteremia and adhere to tissues. Consequently it has adapted to growth in blood by subversion of plasma proteins (3Chavakis T. Wiechmann K. Preissner K.T. Herrmann M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2005; 94: 278-285PubMed Google Scholar) and the tissue extracellular matrix (4Patti J.M. Allen B.L. McGavin M.J. Hook M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 585-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Members of the MSCRAMM (microbial extracellular matrix-binding protein) family of adhesion proteins bind extracellular matrix ligands such as collagen, fibronectin, and fibrinogen (4Patti J.M.

SspA is expressed in an operon with a cysteine protease, SspB, and activates the zSspB zymogen by removing its N-terminal propeptide (10Massimi I. Park E. Rice K. Muller-Esterl W. Sauder D.

Mature 20-kDa SspB mimics plasma serine proteases as noted by its ability to (i) convert high molecular weight kininogen into heavy and light chains, (ii) hydrolyze the Bz-Pro-Phe-Arg substrate of kallikrein, a serine protease that processes single chain kininogen by excision of the vasoactive peptide bradykinin (RPPGFSPFR), (iii) process the N terminus of the fibrinogen β-chain at the same site as plasmin, and (iv) remove the N-terminal domain of fibronectin with a specificity equivalent to plasminogen activator (10Massimi I.

We have also found that antibodies to SspB are produced when mice are challenged with hypervirulent strains of community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus and that SspA and SspB are rapidly expressed in neutrophil vacuoles following phagocytosis (11Burlak C.

Cell Microbiol. 2007; 9: 1172-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), alluding to a role in modifying vacuolar proteins. A third gene in the ssp operon encodes a small protein, SspC, now commonly referred to as Staphostatin B, which we identified as an inhibitor of SspB (10Massimi I. Park E. Rice K. Muller-Esterl W. Sauder D. McGavin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41770-41777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and for which others defined the structural basis of inhibition (12Filipek R. Rzychon M. Oleksy A. Gruca M. Dubin A. Potempa J. Bochtler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40959-40966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The need for an inhibitor is supported by the finding that expression of SspB in Escherichia coli is lethal unless accompanied by Staphostatin B or a Cys → Ser active site mutant in SspB. Moreover inactivation of sspCin S. aureus promotes a gross disturbance in growth and protein export, supporting a role for Staphostatin B in protecting against activation of zSspB during protein export (13Potempa J. Golonka E. Filipek R. Shaw L.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 14Rzychon M. Sabat A. Kosowska K. Potempa J. Dubin A. Mol.

Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1751-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). One means by which this could occur would be if zSspA were also activated prematurely. However, although it has long been thought that the metalloprotease Aureolysin is in turn essential for activation of zSspA (16Drapeau G.R. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 136: 607-613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), one study found that zSspA was correctly activated albeit with reduced efficiency in an aur-deficient strain (17Shaw L. Golonka E. Potempa J. Foster S.J. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In the present study, we elucidated a novel stepwise process for activation of zSspA that minimizes the possibility of its untimely activation. We found that although Aureolysin is essential for activation of zSspA the first step in processing of the N-terminal propeptide requires autocatalytic intramolecular cleavage at glutamine. Aureolysin then processes at Leu58 and then Val69 to produce the first active molecules of mature SspA, which then feed back to promote efficient autocatalytic intermolecular processing of remaining zSspA at Glu65. This exposes an N-terminal 66HAN tripeptide that blocks the active site until final Aur-dependent processing exposes the hydrophobic N terminus (69VIL) that is common in the trypsin family proteases. These events must occur in the proper sequence for efficient activation. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—Bacterial strains and recombinant plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. S. aureus and E. coli were cultured at 37 °C in tryptic soy broth (Becton Dickinson and Company) and LB medium (Invitrogen), respectively. Medium was supplemented with agar (15 g·liter−1; Difco) or antibiotic (ampicillin, 100 μg·ml−1; erythromycin, 10 μg·ml−1; chloramphenicol, 10 μg·ml−1;or kanamycin, 25 μg·ml−1) as required. For production of secreted proteins, cultures were grown for 18 h in tryptic soy broth with vigorous aeration. E. coli DH5α (Invitrogen) was used as a host for construction of shuttle vectors that were transferred to S. aureus RN4220 by electroporation (18Novick R.P.

Plasmid DNA was isolated using the GenElute Plasmid Miniprep kit (Sigma) following recommended protocols. Polymerase chain reaction was performed with Biotools DNA polymerase (Interscience) in the buffer supplied or with the Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche Applied Science) for products larger than 2 kb. PCR products used in cloning were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen) or Concert Rapid Gel Extraction System (Invitrogen). All plasmids harboring cloned DNA fragments were submitted to the Center for Applied Genomics at the Toronto Hospital for Sick Children for verification of the expected nucleotide sequences. Purification of Proteases from S. aureus—Mature SspA and SspB were purified from culture supernatant of S. aureus RN6390sarA::km, which expresses high levels of secreted protease due to a defect in SarA, which is a repressor of protease gene expression (53Chan P.F. Foster S.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6232-6241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 40-kDa SspB zymogen zSspB was purified from culture supernatant of S. aureus RN6390sspA::erm, which cannot activate zSspB due to a defect in production of the SspA serine protease. The purification schemes were as described previously (10Massimi I. Park E. Rice K. Muller-Esterl W. Sauder D. McGavin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41770-41777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Aureolysin was purified from a sarA::km derivative of RN6390. Protein in stationary phase culture supernatant was precipitated with 80% saturation of ammonium sulfate followed by dialysis into 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, containing 5 mm CaCl2. Aur was then purified by successive anion exchange steps on HiLoad 16/10 Q Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) and Tricorn Mono Q medium (Amersham Biosciences). Protein was eluted in linear ascending NaCl gradients. The concentration of purified proteins was determined using the absorbance at 280 nm (A280) combined with extension coefficients calculated using the ExPASy ProtParam tool (ca.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html).

The primers incorporate HindIII and PstI sites (in italic lowercase), respectively, and the underlined sequence in the reverse primer incorporates a His6 tag prior to the stop codon at the 3′-end of sspA.

Peralta R. Bast D. de Azavedo J. McGavin M.J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and 6390aur::lacZ. To substitute the active site serine of SspA, we first excised sspA from pV8H and ligated it into the complementary HindIII and PstI sites of pUC18. PCR-directed mutagenesis was performed on the ligation mixture using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis strategy (Stratagene) together with the complementary primers GTACAACTGGTGGTAATGCAGGTTCACCTGTATTTAATG and CATTAAATACAGGTGAACCTGCATTACCACCAGTTGTAC, which alters (TCA)Ser237 to (GCA)Ala237. The mutagenized plasmid was transformed into E. coli, and after sequencing to confirm the desired substitution, the 3′-end of sspA containing the Ser237 → Ala substitution was excised by digestion with PspGI and PstI and then used to substitute for the same fragment of the wild type pV8H plasmid from S. aureus SP6391. The resulting pV8H-S237A was then transformed into SP6391 and 6390aur::lacZ genetic backgrounds. The expected nucleotide changes and integrity of the sspA gene was confirmed by nucleotide sequence analyses. Purification of His6-SspA Variants—His-tagged SspA variants were isolated from culture supernatant using magnetic Ni-NTA (Fe-Ni2+) beads (Qiagen) for SDS-PAGE and N-terminal sequence analysis or Ni-NTA-agarose slurry (Qiagen) for purification of larger quantities of protein. Briefly the supernatant from a late exponential phase culture (5 h) was mixed with an equal volume of ice-cold 40 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 m NaCl and 40 mm imidazole, and rocked with Ni-NTA beads for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing the magnetic beads three times in phosphate buffer containing 20 mm imidazole and 500 mm NaCl, bound protein was eluted by boiling in 1× SDS-PAGE reducing buffer. Alternately Ni-NTA-agarose slurry was mixed with culture supernatant and packed into a disposable 5-ml polypropylene column (Pierce) followed by application of 50 ml of wash buffer and elution with 500 mm imidazole elution buffer. Samples were desalted into 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, using either PD-10 columns (Amersham Biosciences) or Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassettes (Pierce). Purification of zSspA—The zSspA zymogen was purified from 4-h culture supernatant of RN6390aur::lacZ harboring pV8H. Protein was precipitated from culture supernatant with 80% ammonium sulfate saturation and purified using a 1-ml HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences) in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl buffer with a linear gradient from 10 to 500 mm imidazole. Eluted fractions were exchanged into 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, containing 150 mm NaCl using the HiPrep 26/10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences). Where indicated, zSspA was processed with either Aureolysin (1:1 zSspA:Aur) or native SspA (50:1 zSspA:native SspA) by incubation for 1 h at 37 °C in 40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, with 5 mm CaCl2 for Aur or without calcium for SspA. The in vitro processed zSspA was then separated from the non-His-tagged proteases by capture on Ni-NTA magnetic beads and eluted with 500 mm imidazole. Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassettes (Pierce) were used to dialyze samples into 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 25 mm NaCl. Enzyme Assays and Substrates—SspA glutamyl endopeptidase activity was measured by monitoring the release of p-nitroaniline (pNA) from Z-Phe-Leu-Glu-pNA (Bachem) at 37 °C. Assays were conducted in triplicate wells of a microtiter plate in a 100-μl volume containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.4 mm substrate. Absorbances were read at defined time points on a Bio-Rad model 3550 microplate reader equipped with a 405-nm filter. Stock solutions of 4-nitroaniline (Sigma) were used to create a standard of absorbance versus nmol of pNA to allow calculation of specific activity. Production of Antibodies—Purified SspB zymogen, native SspA, or Aureolysin were emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant (Sigma) and administered by subcutaneous injection of 100 μg of protein in New Zealand White rabbits. Booster injections administered at 2-week intervals consisted of 100 μg of protein emulsified in Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Sigma). Antibodies were affinity-purified from the respective antisera obtained after the second boost using the reagents and protocols provided with the AminoLink Plus Immobilization kit (Pierce). SDS-PAGE, Western Blotting, and N-terminal Sequencing—Proteins in cell-free culture supernatant were precipitated with an equal volume of ice-cold 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. After washing with 70% ethanol, the pellets were air-dried and then solubilized in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were either visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) using standard buffer and transfer conditions for Western immunoblots or CAPS transfer buffer using modified conditions (22Yuen S.W. Chui A.H. Wilson K.J. Yuan P.M. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 74-83PubMed Google Scholar) when required for N-terminal sequence analysis. Western blot procedures followed standard blocking and washing protocols. Primary antibodies were antigen-specific, and secondary antibody was alkaline phosphatase-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-rabbit (heavy and light chains) IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). For N-terminal sequence analysis, blotted proteins were visualized by brief staining with 0.1% Coomassie Blue in 40% methanol. The appropriate bands were excised and submitted to the Advanced Protein Technology Center at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada for N-terminal sequence determination. Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectrometry was conducted at the Toronto Angiogenesis Research Center Proteomics Core Facility in the Sunnybrook Research Institute. For mass determination, purified protein samples were exchanged into 5% formic acid by ultrafiltration, then diluted 20-fold in 50% acetonitrile and 2% formic acid, and analyzed by electrospray ionization-hybrid quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (QStar-XL, Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex) through infusion at 6 μl·min−1 flow rate. The machine was cleaned by infusing 100 μl of 50% trifluoroethanol to eliminate carryover between samples and was calibrated immediately before each sample. Spectra obtained over 3 min of steady spray were accumulated and used for molecular weight reconstruction with “Bayesian Protein Reconstruct” in the BioAnalyst 1.1.5 software package (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex) using default settings unless otherwise indicated. For protein identification, proteins were digested with trypsin (Promega) using the in-gel digestion protocol (23Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). Peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using the Agilent 1100 nanoflow high pressure liquid chromatography system with Agilent XCT-Plus ion trap (Agilent Technologies), and the data base search against NCBInr was performed by Spectrum Mill software (Agilent Technologies). Bioinformatics and Protein Modeling—Domain identity and organization of the preprozymogen forms of the Aur and SspA proteases were obtained from the Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool web server interface provided by the European Molecular Biology Laboratory at smart.embl-heidel-berg.de (24Letunic I. Copley R.R. Pils B. Pinkert S. Schultz J. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D257-D260Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). To model the penultimate intermediate in activation of zSspA, the amino acid residues HAN were first built onto the N terminus of mature V8 protease with the modeling program TURBO-FRODO (25Roussel A. Cambilleau C. TURBO-FRODO. Biographics, LaboratoÀre de Cristallographie et Cristallisation des Macromolecules Biologiques, Marseille, France1992Google Scholar). The residues were positioned visually, and modeled protein was subjected to energy minimization using the program MacroModel (26Mohamadi F. Richards N. Guida W. Liskamp R. Lipton M. Caufield C. Chang G. Hendrickson T. Still W. J. Comput. Chem. 1990; 11: 440Crossref Scopus (3933) Google Scholar). The Merck molecular force field was used with water as the solvent medium, and the minimization was carried out by the molecular dynamics simulated annealing method. Temporal Analysis of Zymogen Activation—The 33-kDa zSspA has a predicted 29-amino acid signal peptide followed by a small N-terminal propeptide harboring a glutamine-rich segment that is predicted to be a region of intrinsic disorder (Fig. 1). The mature protease begins at Val69 and has a trypsin-like serine protease domain where His119, Asp161, and Ser237 form the catalytic triad. This is followed at the C terminus by another predicted disordered segment of unknown function consisting mainly of Pro, Asp, and Asn. Because the 53-kDa zAur and 40-kDa zSspB proteins have larger 20-kDa propeptides, we could determine the activation status of each protease in culture supernatant during growth of S. aureus RN6390 (Fig. 2). There was no evidence of zAur at any time point. Mature 40-kDa Aur appeared at 3 h, reached a maximum at 5–6 h, and then began to diminish. In contrast zSspA and zSspB were prominent at 5 h and were each converted to mature protease over a span of more than 3 h. Activation of zSspA proceeded through at least two intermediates, whereas zSspB was directly converted to mature protease, confirming our previous finding that in vitro processing by SspA at Glu177 alone was sufficient for activation (10Massimi I.

Therefore, secretion and maturation of Aur precedes the appearance of zSspA, which is activated by a mechanism that is distinct from zAur or zSspB.FIGURE 2Processing of protease zymogens in culture supernatant of S. aureus. Culture supernatant sampled at the indicated time points was processed immediately for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with antibodies specific for Aur, SspA, and SspB as indicated. The sample volume was adjusted in proportion to culture density at each time point, equivalent to 0.05 OD600 units. Arrows on the right margin identify the mature form of each protease.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Identification of Intermediates in zSspA Activation—The N-terminal Val69 of mature SspA suggests that maturation is synchronous with processing at REHAN ↓ 69VILP. This is consistent with a report that a metalloprotease was needed for activation of V8 protease (16Drapeau G.R. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 136: 607-613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that the metalloprotease Aureolysin cleaves peptide bonds where the amide nitrogen atom is contributed by a hydrophobic amino acid (27Banbula A. Potempa J. Travis J. Fernandez-Catalan C. Mann K. Huber R. Bode W. Medrano F. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 1185-1193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). As there are only a few such sites within the propeptide (Fig. 1), we sought to confirm these as activation intermediates by expressing zSspA with a C-terminal His6 tag in an sspA::erm derivative of S. aureus RN6390. When secreted proteins from a 5-h culture were immediately subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot, four immunoreactive polypeptides were evident (Fig. 3). Subsequent N-terminal sequencing established that the largest polypeptide corresponded to unprocessed zSspA, having been cleaved only at the predicted signal peptidase site ANA ↓ 30LSSKA. The two intermediate polypeptides had N-terminal sequences consistent with processing at QQTQ ↓ 44SSKQQ in the predicted disordered segment and at KGGN ↓ 58LKPLE, which complies with the specificity of Aur. The smallest isoform was processed at QRE ↓ 66HANV just proximal to Val69 of mature SspA. As this was unexpected, we performed mass spectrometry analysis on native SspA purified from S. aureus culture supernatant (Table 2). Three mass isoforms were evident in the purified SspA protein that by integration of peak areas in the mass spectrum were present in a 100:48:21 ratio. The most abundant corresponded to the expected mass of native SspA with an N-terminal Val69. The next most abundant appeared to be a variant of SspA that lacked two C-terminal alanine residues. The least abundant species corresponded to the expected mass of the N-terminal 66HANV isoform that was identified by N-terminal sequencing of the His6-polypeptides. Therefore, this is not an artifact of expressing recombinant His6-tagged proteins. As His66 is preceded by a glutamic acid, this finding alludes to the possibility of a role for autocatalytic processing.TABLE 2Mass values for isoforms of native SspA and self-processed His6"
https://openalex.org/W2089590499,"Recombination and reassortment of viral genomes are major processes contributing to the creation of new, emerging viruses. These processes are especially significant in long-term persistent infections where multiple viral genotypes co-replicate in a single host, generating abundant genotypic variants, some of which may possess novel host-colonizing and pathogenicity traits. In some plants, successive vegetative propagation of infected tissues and introduction of new genotypes of a virus by vector transmission allows for viral populations to increase in complexity for hundreds of years allowing co-replication and subsequent recombination of the multiple viral genotypes. Using a resequencing microarray, we examined a persistent infection by a Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) complex in citrus, a vegetatively propagated, globally important fruit crop, and found that the complex comprised three major and a number of minor genotypes. Subsequent deep sequencing analysis of the viral population confirmed the presence of the three major CTV genotypes and, in addition, revealed that the minor genotypes consisted of an extraordinarily large number of genetic variants generated by promiscuous recombination between the major genotypes. Further analysis provided evidence that some of the recombinants underwent subsequent divergence, further increasing the genotypic complexity. These data demonstrate that persistent infection of multiple viral genotypes within a host organism is sufficient to drive the large-scale production of viral genetic variants that may evolve into new and emerging viruses."
https://openalex.org/W1994016401,"Members of the guanine exchange factor (GEF) family of scaffold proteins are involved in the integration of signal flow downstream of many receptors in adaptive immunity. However, the full complement of GEFs that function downstream of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) requires further identification and functional understanding. By systematically integrating expression profiles from immune and epithelial cells with functional studies, we demonstrate that protein kinase A anchoring protein 13 (AKAP13), a scaffold protein with GEF activity, is an activator of NF-κB downstream of TLR2 signaling. Stimulation of the human macrophage cell line THP-1 and epithelial cells with a TLR2 ligand caused a significant up-regulation in AKAP13 mRNA, corresponding to an increase in protein expression. Analysis of TLR2 reporter cell lines deficient in AKAP13 expression revealed significantly reduced NF-κB activation and reduced secretion of interleukin-8 and MCP-1 in response to specific ligand stimulation. Furthermore, NF-κB activation was partially inhibited by a GEF-deficient AKAP13 mutant. AKAP13 was also involved in phosphorylation of JNK but not of extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK1 and -2 following ligand stimulation. Together, our results suggest that AKAP13 plays a role in TLR2-mediated NF-κB activation and suggest that GEF-containing scaffold proteins may confer specificity to innate immune responses downstream of TLRs.

Recent studies have demonstrated that the combinatorial recruitment of adaptor proteins provides an initial level of signaling specificity from the receptors. Uncontrolled activation of TLRs may be detrimental to the host and is therefore tightly regulated. Previous reports show that multiple inhibitory proteins are involved in down-regulating TLR signaling (1Liew F.Y. Xu D. Brint E.K. O'Neill L.A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 446-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). However, knowledge of the full spectrum of mechanisms that “fine tune” specific TLR activation is incomplete. TLRs can selectively activate the MyD88-dependent pathway (TLR1, -2, -5, -6, -7, -8, and -9), MyD88-independent pathway (TLR3), or both (TLR4) (2Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6617) Google Scholar) and are localized on intracellular organelles and/or the cell membrane (3Matsumoto M. Funami K. Tanabe M. Oshiumi H. Shingai M.

Chem. 2005; 280: 37107-37117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Another way of achieving TLR signaling specificity is through heterodimerization of receptors for optimal signal activation (e.g. with TLR2 and TLR1/6) (5Ozinsky A. Underhill D.M. Fontenot J.D. Hajjar A.M. Smith K.D. Wilson C.B. Schroeder L. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13766-13771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1668) Google Scholar). Utilization of members of the GTPase family that function as molecular switches is another potential mechanism for regulating TLR signal induction (6Ruse M. Knaus U.G. Immunol. Res. 2006; 34: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Rho family GTPases control multiple cellular processes and have been previously reported to regulate TLR signaling. GTPases in turn are controlled by GEFs and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) that activate and inactivate them, respectively (7Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3819) Google Scholar). However, only limited data connect GEFs to TLR signaling (8Hebeis B. Vigorito E. Kovesdi D. Turner M. Blood. 2005; 106: 635-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 9Stovall S.H. Yi A.K. Meals E.A. Talati A.J. Godambe S.A. English B.K. J. Biol.

Here we show that AKAP13, a scaffold protein that is a member of the A-kinase anchoring protein family and also has GEF activity, is induced by TLR2 ligands and mediates NF-κB activation via TLR2. We also demonstrate that this activation depends on the GEF function of AKAP13 and that AKAP13 knockdown reduces TLR2-induced JNK phosphorylation but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1 and -2) or p38. Computational Analysis—Utilizing the PFAM data base, we identified a nonredundant set of 76 genes, which encode for either the RhoGEF domain (PF00621) or dedicator of cytokinesis/DOCK (PF06920) domain in the human genome (supplemental Table 1). The DOCK domain was included because it has been shown to have GEF activity (10Meller N. Merlot S. Guda C. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4937-4946Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) site on the World Wide Web contains 70 clusters based on hierarchical clustering of 159,075 CAGE tag clusters across 23 tissue/cell type conditions (11Carninci P. Sandelin A. Lenhard B. Katayama S. Shimokawa K. Ponjavic J. Semple C.A. Taylor M.S. Engstrom P.G. Frith M.C. Forrest A.R. Alkema W.B. Tan S.L. Plessy C. Kodzius R. Ravasi T. Kasukawa T. Fukuda S. Kanamori-Katayama M. Kitazume Y. Kawaji H. Kai C. Nakamura M. Konno H. Nakano K. Mottagui-Tabar S. Arner P. Chesi A. Gustincich S. Persichetti F. Suzuki H. Grimmond S.M. Wells C.A. Orlando V.

The cluster ID = 64 contains 979 cluster tag IDs associated with the 5′ ends of genes that are expressed in immune cells, such as macrophages both at base line and upon activation with agents such as LPS and CpG. These 979 clusters mapped to 746 mouse genes with unique Entrez gene identifiers. In order to analyze the expression pattern of RhoGEF/DOCK genes in the human genome and assess which were enriched in the immune system, we analyzed a compendium of 79 human tissues/cells profiled by microarray technology. The public version of the GNF human expression atlas version 2 (12Su A.I. Wiltshire T. Batalov S. Lapp H. Ching K.A. Block D. Zhang J. Soden R. Hayakawa M. Kreiman G. Cooke M.P. Walker J.R. Hogenesch J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6062-6067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2842) Google Scholar) was obtained from Novartis (available on the World Wide Web), including the primary .cel files, which used the U133a Affymetrix chip and a custom chip (GNF1H). The data set was filtered by requiring that a probe set have a threshold value of >20 in at least one sample and a maximum-minimum expression value of >100. A total of 28,852 reliable probes met the above filtering criteria. For each, the corresponding UniGene ID and LocusLink ID were identified based on the combined annotation tables provided at the Novartis and NetAffyx sites on the World Wide Web. Of the 28,852 probe sets, 26,789 mapped to 16,811 UniGene IDs. To represent the human expression profiles of RhoGEF, hierarchical clustering with the centroid linkage method was performed using DCHIP using 1 - r as the distance metric, where r is the Pearson correlation coefficient, with relative expression levels displayed. For the 76 RhoGEF/DOCK genes that we identified based on their PFAM domains, at least one probe for 54 of the 76 genes was represented on the arrays and met our filtering criteria as well as the DCHIP default filtering criteria. Heat maps of hierarchical clustering of tissue expression and correlation values are based on a single probe set per gene chosen at random so as not to bias the visual presentation. To ascertain if any RhoGEF genes were enriched in the immune system of the normal tissue/cell compendium, we used the Wilcoxon rank sum test. To calculate the Wilcoxon statistic, we divided the 79 tissue/cell types into those of immune system origin (n = 22) and those that are not part of the immune system (n = 57), making two sample classes. The p values from the Wilcoxon test for each RhoGEF/DOCK gene were then calculated with a significance threshold considered (p < 0.05). As shown in supplemental Fig. 1, RhoGEF denoted by a Wilcoxon score of p < 0.05 identified by a tick mark on the left of the heat map. Cell Lines and Antibodies—HEK293 cells, stably transfected with TLR2, were a gift from Dr. Douglas Golenbock (University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA) and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 μg/ml ciprofloxacin (Sigma), and 10 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). 3T3 RelA-deficient fibroblasts were a gift from Dr. Thomas D. Gilmore (Biology Department, Boston University, Boston MA) and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a5%CO2 atmosphere within a humidified incubator. Polyclonal rabbit antiserum against AKAP13 was kindly provided by Dr. John Scott (Vollum Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR). Polyclonal rabbit antibodies against p65, GFP, and actin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal rabbit antibodies against phospho-JNK, phospho-ERK1/2, phospho-p38, total JNK, ERK1/2, and p38 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Monoclonal mouse antibodies against Tollip were purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA) (Axxora Platform). [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Plasmids and Small Interfering RNA—FLAG-GFP-tagged and GFP-tagged AKAP13 were a gift from Dr. John Scott (13Diviani D. Soderling J. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44247-44257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). All AKAP13 mutants were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX). For NF-κB activity determination, cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with 1 ng of Ig-κ pIV luciferase reporter plasmid and Renilla plasmid. Activity was measured using the Dual Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) in a BD moonlight 3010 luminometer (BD Biosciences) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and normalized to Renilla activity. siRNA to AKAP13 were purchased from Ambion Inc. (Austin, TX): 1) (ID1475) forward sequence (5′-GGAGAAGGAGAAAGATTCTTT) and reverse (5′-AGAATCTTTCTCCTTCTCCTT); 2) (ID1569) forward (5′-GGAGAAAGATTCTAAAGAC) and reverse (5′-GTCTTTAGAATCTTTCTCC). Several negative control siRNAs were purchased from Ambion Inc. and assessed for their ability to knock down AKAP13 expression. Negative control 1 siRNA (catalog number AM4611) had the least effect and was used in all experiments. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—HEK-TLR2 cells were grown in 6-cm dishes and transfected with AKAP13 siRNA or control siRNA. After 60 h, cells were stimulated with 1 μg/ml of palmitoyl-3-cysteine-serine-lysine 4 (pam3CSK4) (Invivogen, San Diego, CA) for 15, 30, or 60 min or with tumor necrosis factor-α for 30 min (R & D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) as a positive control. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to a protocol previously reported (14Furuta G.T. Turner J.R. Taylor C.T. Hershberg R.M. Comerford K. Narravula S. Podolsky D.K. Colgan S.P. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1027-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed in 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, collected by centrifugation (3000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C), and incubated in buffer A (10 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mm Na3VO4, protease inhibitor (complete Mini®; Roche Applied Science)) for 10 min. Cells were then lysed in 0.8% Nonidet P-40 (13,000 rpm for 30 s at 4 °C). The pellet was resuspended in buffer C (20 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mm NaVO4, 0.4 m NaCl, and 200 mm Pefabloc SC (Roche Applied Science)) rocked for 15 min at 4 °C, and then centrifuged (15,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C). Protein concentration in the supernatant was determined by the Bradford method. Consensus (5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C) and mutant (5′-AGT TGA GGC GAC TTT CCC AGG C) NF-κB oligonucleotides were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Double strand oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega Biosciences, San Luis Obispo, CA). The reaction was conducted in a total volume of 20 μl using 10 μg of nuclear protein extract, 1 μl of labeled oligonucleotide, 5 μl of EMSA buffer (20% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm DTT, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), poly(dI-dC) (0.25 μg/μl), and 4 μl of water. For competition assays, 1 μl of cold or mutant oligonucleotide was added to the reaction. The samples were loaded onto a 4% non-denaturating polyacrylamide/bisacrylamide gel and run in 0.5× TBE buffer. The gel was dried, and the resultant DNA-protein complexes were detected by autoradiography. Western Blot Analysis—For the detection of AKAP13, p38 JNK/SAPK, ERK1 and -2, actin, and Tollip, cells were seeded into 12-well dishes and transfected with either AKAP13 siRNA or control siRNA. After 60 h, cells were stimulated with pam3CSK4 as described above and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm Na2P2O4, and protease inhibitor), centrifuged (15,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was assayed for protein concentration using the Bradford method. Extraction of protein from human intestinal tissue samples was performed following homogenization using the same lysis buffer described above. Equal amounts of protein were solubilized in Tris-glycine SDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) and electrophoresed on 4-12% gradient Novex® Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen). Following electrophoresis, proteins were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes that were incubated with AKAP13- or phospho-MAPK-specific antibodies. Detection using horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody (Amersham Biosciences) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-total MAPK, anti-actin, or anti-Tollip to confirm equal loading. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—ELISA kits for the detection of IL-8 and MCP-1 were purchased from BD Biosciences. Cytokine concentrations in cell culture supernatants were determined in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse Transcription-PCR—THP-1 cells were seeded into 12-well plates at a density of 0.8 × 106 cells/well and stimulated with 160 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma) for 24 h followed by stimulation with 1 μg/ml pam3CSK4 or 100 ng/ml LPS (Invivogen) for varying times. For reverse transcription, 2 μg of total RNA were reverse-transcribed using an iScript™ cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Mouse tissues were obtained from naive C57/B6 mice. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines and protocols approved by the Subcommittee on Research Animal Care at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Human intestinal biopsies were obtained from noninflamed tissue from patients with inflammational bowel disease undergoing routine screening for cancer surveillance. Informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to the procedure, and the protocol was approved by the Human Studies Committee of the Massachusetts General Hospital. Extraction of RNA from mouse and human tissues was performed using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. AKAP13 was PCR-amplified from 2 μl of cDNA using the following PCR program: 95 °C for 120 s, followed by 35 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an internal control. The primer sequences for human AKAP13 (NM_007200) were 5′-CAGCAAGCTCCCTTATATGGTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGGAGGGTGGAACCCAAAA-3′ (reverse) (147-base pair amplicon), and sequences for GAPDH were 5′-TCATCTCTGCCCCCTCTGCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGACGCCTGCTTCACCACCT-3′ (reverse) (440-base pair amplicon). Negative controls included the amplification of samples without prior reverse transcription reaction. The primer sequences for mouse AKAP13 (XM_907140) were 5′-ATGGGGCGGATAGGAGAAGG-3′ (forward) and 3′-GCAAGGAGCAAGCACGGCGGT-5′ (reverse) (161-base pair amplicon), and sequences for mouse GAPDH were 5′-GGAGCCAAACGGGTCATCATCTC-3′ (forward) and 3′-GAGGGGCCATCCACAGTCTTCT-5′ (reverse) (211-base pair amplicon). Real time quantitative PCR was performed in the DNA Engine Opticon® 2 system (MJ Research, Boston, MA) using the iQ™SYBR®Green super mix (Bio-Rad). Briefly, 100 ng of reverse transcribed cDNA were used for each PCR with 250 nm forward and reverse primers. The thermal cycling conditions were composed of 4 min at 95 °C, followed by 35 cycles at 94 °C for 15 s, 58 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. The threshold cycle (CT) values were obtained for the reactions, reflecting the quantity of the template in the sample. AKAP13 ΔCT was calculated by subtracting the calibrator gene GAPDH CT value from the AKAP13 CT value and thus represented the relative quantity of the target mRNA normalized to GAPDH mRNA. The mRNA content of AKAP13 in untreated cells was defined as 1 arbitrary unit. Immunohistochemistry—HEK-TLR2 cells were seeded onto Lab Tek® chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) and transfected with AKAP13 siRNA or control siRNA or left untransfected. Sixty hours later, cells were either stimulated with specific ligands or left unstimulated and then washed and fixed in ice-cold 100% methanol. Following fixation, cells were blocked with PBS containing 5% serum of the secondary antibody host and incubated with primary antibody followed by washing and incubating with fluorescein isothiocyanate-secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA). Following three further washes, the slides were mounted using 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole containing mounting media (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories, Burlington, CA) and examined in an inverted microscope under a ×40 objective Olympus model AX70 (Olympus America Inc., Center Valley, PA) and a laser confocal microscope model Radiance 2000 (Bio-Rad) using multitracking (line switching) for two-color imaging (×40). Image acquisition was performed with LaserSharpScanning software (Bio-Rad). Rho-binding Domain Pull-down Assay—HEK-TLR2 cells transfected with the indicated plasmids were grown for 24 h in the presence of 10% serum and were serum-starved for an additional 24 h. Cells were then incubated for 2 and 5 min with 1 μg/ml pam3CSK4. Cells were lysed, and Rho-binding domain pull-down was performed using the EZ-Detect™ Rho activation kit (Pierce) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance between groups was assessed by Student's t test. Data are expressed as means ± S.D. Triplicate determinations were performed in the IL-8 ELISA experiments, and all experiments were repeated at least three times. A p value equal to or less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Two-way analysis of variance was used to compare multiple time/groups. A Combined Computational and Experimental Approach Suggests AKAP13 Is a Candidate TLR2 Signaling Cascade Regulator—A combined computational and experimental approach outlined in Fig. 1 was developed in order to identify GEFs in the human genome that might act as modulators of TLR signaling. In step 1, we utilized the PFAM protein domain data base to generate a compendium of genes that are capable of encoding proteins with known or potential RhoGEF/DOCK activity, ultimately identifying 76 genes in the human genome encoding Rho-GEF domains (Fig. 1 and supplemental Table 1; see “Experimental Procedures”). Next, we reasoned that, since a large proportion of TLR signaling components are enriched or selectively expressed in cells of the immune system or mucosal colonic epithelial cells, a bona fide TLR RhoGEF would share these characteristics (15Jenner R.G. Young R.A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Accordingly, in step 2, we systematically analyzed the expression profiles of the identified RhoGEF genes on a genome-wide scale utilizing two complementary data sources: microarrays (left) and CAGE technology (right) (11Carninci P. Sandelin A. Lenhard B. Katayama S. Shimokawa K. Ponjavic J. Semple C.A. Taylor M.S. Engstrom P.G. Frith M.C. Forrest A.R. Alkema W.B. Tan S.L. Plessy C. Kodzius R. Ravasi T. Kasukawa T. Fukuda S.

Analysis of the expression patterns of 54 of 76 RhoGEF genes across a compendium of 79 human tissues/cells, revealed a subset of RhoGEFs (n = 24) co-expressed and selectively enriched in the immune system based on hierarchical clustering and Wilcoxon rank sum testing (p < 0.05) (supplemental Fig. 1). In addition, clustering of CAGE data representing promoter activity across 23 different mouse tissues/cells under various conditions revealed a list of 746 gene signatures enriched for immune/macrophage expression. Among the 746 genes, there were eight RhoGEFs selectively expressed in immune/macrophages as compared with other tissues profiled in this data set. In step 3, we integrated these two data sources via an AND logic rule that candidate TLR RhoGEFs must be enriched in expression in the immune system based on the CAGE data AND microarray profiles. This resulted in the identification of a consensus set of five candidate TLR RhoGEFs. These included AKAP13, which functions as a protein kinase A (PKA)-anchoring protein, and a RhoA-specific GEF. In step 4, we analyzed the expression profile of these five RhoGEFs in an independent data set, since the above two data sets had not included colonic epithelium, identifying AKAP13 as not only enriched in immune cells but also expressed in colonic epithelial cells (step 4.1) (16Shyamsundar R. Kim Y.H. Higgins J.P. Montgomery K. Jorden M. Sethuraman A. van de Rijn M. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Pollack J.R. Genome Biol. 2005; 6: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We validated our search results by looking at AKAP13 expression in human and mouse colon and ileum. AKAP13 mRNA was expressed in human and murine intestinal tissue. AKAP13 protein was detected by Western blot analysis in human tissue. Currently, available AKAP13 antibodies do not reliably recognize murine AKAP13 (Fig. 1, 4.2). AKAP13 Is Expressed in Intestinal Epithelial and Immune Cell Lines—AKAP13 is a PKA-anchoring protein that also functions as a RhoA-specific GEF. Basal expression of AKAP13 in epithelial and immune cell lines was assessed by reverse transcription-PCR. mRNA encoding AKAP13 was detected in all cell lines examined (SW480, HEK293, HeLaS3, and THP-1) (Fig. 2A). Protein expression in these cell lines was shown using an AKAP13-specific rabbit antiserum (Fig. 2B). To further validate our computational mining and integration strategy, we sought to determine whether AKAP13 and other RhoGEF candidates (ARHGEF2 and DOCK11) were selectively modulated by TLR ligands, such as pam3CSK4 (TLR2) and LPS (TLR4) in a time-dependent manner. Importantly, stimulation of either THP-1 or SW480 cells with TLR2 but not TLR4 ligands resulted in an increase of AKAP13 mRNA expression starting as early as 1 h after stimulation, reaching a peak of 8.5 ± 1.0-fold increase at 3 h and returning to base-line levels at 5 h (Fig. 2C). Similar results were obtained when AKAP13 expression was assessed following TLR2 ligand stimulation in HEK293 cells stably transfected with TLR2 (HEK-TLR2) (data not shown). The induction of AKAP13 mRNA following TLR2 stimulation was also found to correlate over time with increasing AKAP13 protein in THP-1 (Fig. 2D). In contrast, ARHGEF2 mRNA peaked at only 2.5 ± 0.3-fold over base line after pam3CSK4 (supplemental Fig. 2A). In order to confirm that the cell lines we used were responsive to TLR ligand stimulation, interleukin-8 mRNA response, which is known to be strongly up-regulated in response to TLR stimulation, was used as a positive control (supplemental Fig. 2B). Thus, by integrating protein domain analysis and gene expression profiles on a genome-wide scale for RhoGEFs, we hypothesized that AKAP13 may be involved in TLR2 signaling, and we focused on elucidating its potential function. To assess subcellular localization of AKAP13, HeLa cells were transfected with an AKAP13-GFP plasmid and stained with a lipophilic dye (DiI) specific for lipid bilayers in cell membranes and organelles. AKAP13 was localized to the cytoplasm and excluded from the nucleus and cell membrane (Fig. 2E). AKAP13 Is an Activator of NF-κB—To determine whether AKAP13 activates NF-κB, we transfected increasing concentrations of AKAP13 expression plasmid into HEK293 and SW480 cell lines and assessed NF-κB activation using a luciferase reporter assay. AKAP13 caused a concentration-dependent activation of NF-κB in HEK293 (Fig. 3A) and SW480 epithelial cells (data not shown). In order to elucidate whether AKAP13 activates NF-κB via the canonical or alternative pathways, AKAP13 expression plasmid was transfected into RelA-deficient 3T3 fibroblasts or control 3T3 cells. AKAP13 did not activate NF-κB in the RelA-deficient cell line as compared with controls, suggesting that AKAP13 activates NF-κB via the canonical pathway (Fig. 3B). AKAP13 Mediates NF-κB Activation via TLR2 Signaling—The observation that AKAP13 expression is induced by TLR2 ligand stimulation and that AKAP13 activates NF-κB suggested that AKAP13 might function as a regulator of TLR signaling pathways, specifically TLR2. We used a siRNA based approach to determine whether AKAP13 is involved in TLR2-induced NF-κB activation in epithelial cells. siRNA treatment knocked down AKAP13 mRNA and protein by 90 and 80%, respectively (Fig. 4, A and B) in HeLaS3 cells. Since an association of AKAP13 with cytoskeletal actin has been previously described, we examined if AKAP13 silencing might disrupt the actin cytoskeleton and interfere with intracellular signaling. AKAP13 siRNA was cloned into a pSUPER expression plasmid expressing GFP. HeLaS3 cells were transfected and stained for actin and tubulin. Neither actin stress fibers nor tubulin were disrupted by AKAP13 knockdown (Fig. 4C; data not shown). We next assessed the effect of AKAP13 knockdown on TLR2-mediated NF-κB act"

It is characterized by airflow limitation and is principally associated with exposure to cigarette smoke. However, the link between cigarette smoke, bronchial inflammation, and the development of airflow limitation is not completely understood, as 15–20% of smokers develop COPD. One hypothesis is that individuals who develop exhibit an exaggerated inflammatory response to cigarette smoke COPD caused by an immune system that is already primed by previous infections or by the possession of inherited genetic polymorphisms. A number of investigators have shown an increased numbers of T cells in the lungs of patients with COPD (2Saetta M. Di Stefano A. Turato G. Facchini F.M. Corbino L. Mapp C.E. Maestrelli P. Ciaccia A.

CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are increased in the airways and lung parenchyma of COPD patients (4O'Shaughnessy T.C. Ansari T.W. Barnes N.C. Jeffery P.K. Am. J. Respir. Crit Care Med. 1997; 155: 852-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). In addition, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are activated with increased expression of IFN-γ in COPD patients (5Grumelli S. Corry D.B. Song L.Z. Song L. Green L. Huh J. Hacken J. Espada R. Bag R. Lewis D.E. Kheradmand F. PLoS Med. 2004; 1: e8Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). IFN-γ is produced by many cell types, including T-cells and B-cells, and is an important component of the antiviral response. It stimulates both macrophages and NK cells and is involved in the regulation of the immune and inflammatory responses. IFN-γ is also released predominantly by Th1 cells, and recruits leukocytes to a site of infection, resulting in increased inflammation. It activates macrophages for the expression of surface major histocompatibility class II antigens, costimulatory molecules, and inflammatory mediators for tumoricidal and antimicrobial activity. It regulates the proliferation and death of T lymphocytes, promotes the development of a type 1 T-helper cell response, and is essential for the control of many intracellular pathogens in vivo. IFN-γ mRNA or protein has been shown in mouse and human lung macrophages (6Fenton M.J. Vermeulen M.W. Kim S. Burdick M. Strieter R.M. Kornfeld H.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 3075-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The primary families of proteases released into the extracellular space following cell activation include members of the serine protease, matrix metalloprotease (MMP), and cysteinyl cathepsin groups of proteases. Proteases play important roles in numerous biological processes and are capable of degrading many extracellular matrix components and as such are regarded as pivotal in the pathogenesis of COPD. MMPs are produced by a wide variety of cell types including epithelium, fibroblasts, neutrophils, and macrophages. Several MMPs (including MMP-12) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic lung injury, particularly in emphysema. This is shown in MMP-12 knock-out mice, who do not develop air space enlargement in response to smoke exposure (12Hautamaki R.D. Kobayashi D.K. Senior R.M. Shapiro S.D. Science. 1997; 277: 2002-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). Macrophages also synthesize cysteinyl cathepsins, which are ubiquitous lysosomal proteases (13Nagler D.K. Zhang R. Tam W.

Cytokines and microbial products have previously been demonstrated to regulate cathepsin expression and activity (16Fiebiger E. Meraner P. Weber E. Fang I.F. Stingl G. Ploegh H. Maurer D. J. Exp.

Kalbacher H. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2002; 119: 44-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). IL-1 and TNF-α also induce cathepsin S activity, while exposure to IL-10 prevents conversion of procathepsin S into its mature form (16Fiebiger E. Meraner P. Weber E. Fang I.F. Stingl G. Ploegh H. Maurer D. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). IL-13 has been shown to induce cathepsins B, H, K, L, and S (19Zheng T. Zhu Z. Wang Z. Homer R.J. Ma B.

SLPI is an 11.7-kDa nonglycosylated protein produced at mucosal surfaces, primarily the upper respiratory tract (23Abe T. Kobayashi N. Yoshimura K. Trapnell B.C. Kim H. Hubbard R.C. Brewer M.T. Thompson R.C. Crystal R.G. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 87: 2207-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and is an important antiprotease (24Gauthier F. Fryksmark U. Ohlsson K. Bieth J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 700: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). SLPI suppresses LPS-induced activation of NF-κB, production of nitric oxide, and TNF-α (25Jin F.Y. Nathan C. Radzioch D. Ding A. Cell. 1997; 88: 417-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Interestingly, IFN-γ can suppress expression of SLPI (26Odaka C. Mizuochi T. Yang J. Ding A. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 1507-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In a model of acute lung injury, prior administration of SLPI attenuated pulmonary recruitment of neutrophils and decreased lung injury (27Lentsch A.B. Jordan J.A. Czermak B.J. Diehl K.M. Younkin E.M. Sarma V. Ward P.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 239-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that SLPI is taken up into monocytes and becomes distributed within the cytoplasm and nucleus and can bind NF-κB DNA binding regions within the IL-8 and TNF-α promoters (28Taggart C.C. Cryan S.A. Weldon S. Gibbons A. Greene C.M. Kelly E. Low T.B. O'Neill S.J. McElvaney N.G. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 1659-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). SLPI can also diminish p65 binding, thereby attenuating inflammation in monocytes (28Taggart C.C. Cryan S.A. Weldon S. Gibbons A. Greene C.M. Kelly E. Low T.B. O'Neill S.J. McElvaney N.G. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 1659-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We postulated that COPD is associated with a Th1 cytokine profile with IFN-γ plays a central role in activity of macrophages leading to proteolysis of lung tissue. We further propose that SLPI could dampen this protease burden not by its direct antiprotease effect but by its antiinflammatory effects. To test this theory we investigated cytokine and protease levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) fluid from control and COPD patients. Macrophage protease expression was also investigated following activation with IFN-γ stimuli and potential inhibition of protease expression induced by IFN-γ was evaluated in the presence of SLPI. The data from this study provide further evidence of an impaired protease/antiprotease balance in COPD patients because of a Th1 response that can be inhibited by SLPI. Culture and Stimulation of Monocyte Cells—Myelomonocytic cells (U937) (European Collection of Cell Cultures Health Protection Agency, Salisbury, Wiltshire, UK) (5 × 105 cells/ml) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) and were differentiated to macrophage-like cells with PMA for 48 h. The macrophage-like cells were incubated in fresh medium for a further 2 days before stimulation. Stimulation was performed with IFN-γ (R & D Systems, 10 units/ng) for 3 or 24 h before harvesting, for RNA or protein isolation, respectively. SLPI, α1-antitrypsin (A1AT), and Elafin (each at 10 μg/ml) stimulation was administered an hour prior to IFN-γ. Cells were also stimulated with BAL fluid from COPD patients for 2 h, washed three times, and resuspended in serum free medium for a further 48 h. Mouse anti-IFN-γ (R&D Systems) (500 ng/ml) or mouse IgG2A (R&D Systems) (500 ng/ml) was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with COPD BAL fluid prior to cell stimulation. Cells were also treated for 1 h with SN50 and its inactive control, SN50M (Calbiochem) prior to IFN-γ stimuli to block NF-κB activity. Isolation of PBMCs—Mononuclear cells were isolated from heparinized venous peripheral blood obtained from healthy volunteers using Lymphoprep™ (Nycomed, Norway). Briefly, freshly collected EDTA-peripheral blood samples (7.5 ml) were diluted 1:1 in 0.9% NaCl and 2 ml of 10% dextran (Sigma) was added and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Afterward the upper layer containing the mixed leukocyte fraction was removed and overlayered onto 5 ml of Lymphoprep™. The sample was then centrifuged at 200 × g for 10 min. The mononuclear cell interphase band was aspirated and washed three times in HBSS medium. Monocytes were purified to 97% cell purity using the EasySep human CD14 selection mixture as recommended by the manufacturers (StemCell Technologies, London England). Monocytes were then cultured in RPMI containing 40% autologous serum, penicillin G (final concentration 100 units/ml), and streptomycin sulfate (final concentration 100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 9 days (29Punturieri A. Filippov S. Allen E. Caras I. Murray R. Reddy V. Weiss S.J. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 789-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). An hour prior to stimulation, cells were washed and incubated in serum-free medium. BAL Fluid Samples—Samples of BAL fluid and serum were obtained from subjects with COPD (n = 17) and healthy volunteers (n = 15). Ethical approval was obtained from Beaumont Hospital Ethics Committee and informed consent from each of the patients undergoing bronchoscopy. Subjects underwent flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed. Samples were separated into cell suspension and supernatant. IFN-γ Levels Measured by Sandwich ELISA—The concentration of IFN-γ was measured by ELISA using cytokine-specific Abs (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK). Values are expressed as picograms per ml. Semiquantitative Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—After treatment with IFN-γ, cells were harvested in Tri reagent (Sigma-Ireland), and RNA was extracted as detailed in the manufacturerŉs protocol. Total RNA (2 μg) was reverse-transcribed at 37 °C with 1 mm deoxynucleotide mix (Promega, Southampton, UK), 1.6 μg of oligo-p[dT]15 primer (Roche, Lewes, UK), and 1 μl M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Southampton, UK) in a 20-μl volume as described in the manufacturerŉs protocol. 2 μl of each cDNA was amplified with 1.25 units of TaqDNA polymerase, 1× PCR buffer, and 10 mm dNTPs (Promega) in a 50 μl volume containing 100 pmol each of the following primers: 5′-ATG AAA CGG CTG GTT TGT GT-3′ and 5′-CTA GAT TTC TGG GTA AGA GGG AAA GCT AGC-3′ for cathepsin S; 5′-CTG GAC AAC TCA ACT CTG GCA A-3′ and 5′-ATT ATA GAT CCT GTA AGT GAG GTA CCG C-3′ for MMP-12; 5′-GAA GGT GAA GGT CGG AGT CA-3′ and 5′-TTC ACA CCC ATG ACG AAC AT-3′ for GAPDH; 5′-GCC GGG AAA TCG TGC GTG-3′ and 5′-GGG TAC ATG GTG GTG CCG-3′ for β-actin PCR products were quantified densitometrically at cycle numbers between 10 and 40 to determine the appropriate cycle number at which exponential amplification of products was occurring, and to identify the cycle number at which sufficient discrimination was possible to accurately quantify increases or decreases in gene expression. After a hot start, the amplification profile was 30 cycles of 1 min denaturation at 94 °C, 1 min annealing at 58 °C, and 1 min extension at 72 °C for cathepsin S, MMP-12. GAPDH, and β-actin gene amplification required only 20 cycles. RT-PCR amplification of cathepsin S, MMP-12, β-actin and GAPDH generated products of 1000, 703, 307, and 402 bp, respectively. PCR products were commercially sequenced (MWG Biotech AG, Ebersberg, Germany) to verify gene identity. PCR products were resolved on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide (Sigma). The ratio of PCR fragment intensities of each gene relative to GAPDH and β-actin was determined by densitometry. Presence of Cathepsin S—Cathepsin S activity was determined in supernatants from macrophage-like cells 24 h after stimulation with or without IFN-γ or BAL fluid. Cathepsin S activity was determined in 100 μl of each BAL sample using the substrate Z-Phe-Arg-pNA (0.1 mm). The reaction buffer used for cathepsin S activity estimation was 0.2 m sodium acetate, pH 7.5, 2 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm pepstatin, and 2 mm Pefabloc. The samples were incubated with substrate for 60 min at 37 °C, and fluorescence (substrate turnover) was determined by excitation at 355 nm and emission at 460 nm. Results were expressed as a change (delta) in fluorescence units over a 60-min period (FU). Western Blot—BAL fluid from healthy controls and COPD patients were investigated for the presence of MMP-12. Supernatant from U937 macrophages treated with IFN-γ were investigated for cathepsin S and MMP-12. BAL fluid or concentrated media from macrophage-like cells were separated by electrophoresis on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Sigma-Aldrich), which was probed using mouse anti-MMP-12 antibody (R&D Systems), rabbit anti-cathepsin B antibody (Calbiochem), or mouse anti-cathepsin S antibody (Calbiochem). A rabbit anti-MMP-12 (Calbiochem, Oncogene Research Products) antibody was used to detect MMP-12 from cells treated with COPD BAL fluid plus mouse anti-IFN-γ antibody or mouse IgG2A, to minimize antibody interaction. Binding was detected using the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized by chemiluminescence (Pierce). Preparation of Subcellular Fractions—U937 cells were activated with NE and nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were isolated. Briefly cells were washed and resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and kept on ice for 5 min. Cells were lifted from plates with a cell scraper and pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) (Sigma). Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and then lysed for 10 min on ice in 20 μl of hypotonic buffer containing 0.1% Igepal CA-630. Lysates were centrifuged as before, and the cytoplasmic extract was removed. The remaining nuclear pellet was lysed in 15 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (Sigma) for 15 min on ice. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, nuclear extracts were removed into 35 μl of storage buffer (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). Protein concentrations of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were determined, and extracts were stored at–80 °C until required for use. NF-κB Activity ELISA—The effect of IFN-γ and SLPI on NF-κB activity was determined using the TransAM NF-κB ELISA (Active Motif), using nuclear protein fractions. Densitometric Analysis—Gels were analyzed by densitometry and compared in a semiquantitative manner using the GeneGenius Gel Documentation and analysis system (Cambridge, UK) and GeneSnap and GeneTools software. All expression values were verified by at least three independent experiments. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed with the PRISM 3.0 software package (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. and were compared by Studentŉs t test. Differences were considered significant at p ≤ 0.05. IFN-γ in COPD and Effect on Protease Expression in Macrophages—IFN-γ levels in BAL fluid were determined by ELISA and were found to be significantly elevated in COPD individuals versus controls (72.85 ± 28.61 versus 11.16 ± 6.19 pg/ml, p = 0.0484) (Fig. 1A). IFN-γ-induced protease mRNA expression was examined in U937 macrophages. Macrophages were exposed to 25 ng/ml IFN-γ for 3 h. Cathepsin S and MMP-12 mRNA expression levels were investigated by RT-PCR (Fig. 1B). IFN-γ significantly increased expression of cathepsin S and MMP-12 in U937 macrophages (p = 0.0147 and 0.0049, respectively). The effect of IFN-γ stimulation on release of cathepsin S and MMP-12 from U937 macrophages was investigated. Elevated cathepsin S activity was observed when cells were stimulated with IFN-γ, using the cathepsin substrate Z-Phe-Arg-AMC, at pH 7.5 (Fig. 1C, panel i). A statistically significant difference for cathepsin S activity between the control and cells stimulated with 10 ng/ml IFN-γ was observed (p = 0.0013). This was further confirmed by Western blot, which demonstrated the increased production of cathepsin S by IFN-γ stimulated U937 macrophages (Fig. 1C, panel ii). Western blot demonstrated that there was increased MMP-12 release from IFN-γ stimulated U937 macrophages (Fig. 1C, panel ii). Increased MMP-9 activity was observed in U937 macrophages but was most likely due to the presence of small quantities of PMA in the cell medium (data not included). A change in MMP-9 activity was not observed when using similar experiments with PBM macrophages (data not included). IFN-γ-induced Protease Expression—Neutrophil elastase (NE), cathepsin, and MMP levels were measured in COPD and control BAL fluid. NE activity was not detected in COPD or control samples, however elevated cathepsin S activity was observed in COPD compared with control BAL fluid (Fig. 2A, p = 0.0268). Western blot demonstrated the presence of MMP-12 in COPD, but not control BAL fluid (Fig. 2B). Levels of cathepsin S and MMP-12 from U937 macrophages exposed to COPD BAL fluid were also evaluated. Elevated cathepsin S activity was observed when cells were stimulated with COPD BAL fluid compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2C) (p = 0.0011). An anti IFN-γ neutralizing antibody significantly inhibited this effect (p = 0.0073) (Fig. 2C). A mouse IgG2A antibody (isotype control) was also added to COPD BAL fluid and then to cells and was shown to have no inhibitory effects on the COPD BAL fluid induced cathepsin S production (p = 0.8495). The increase in cathepsin S by COPD BAL fluid was further demonstrated by Western blot (Fig. 2D, panel i). COPD BAL fluid exposure also increased MMP-12 protein levels, demonstrated by Western blot (Fig. 2D, panel ii). The anti-IFN-γ antibody had the same inhibition effect on MMP-12 expression in macrophages exposed to COPD BAL fluid. Effect of SLPI on IFN-γ-induced Protease Expression—IFN-γ-induced protease mRNA expression was further examined by the pretreatment of macrophages with SLPI prior to IFN-γ stimulation. U937 and PBM macrophages were exposed to 10 μg/ml SLPI followed by 10 ng/ml IFN-γ. Cathepsin S and 12 mRNA expression levels were investigated by RT-PCR from U937 macrophages (Fig. 3A). IFN-γ significantly increased expression of cathepsin S and MMP-12 even at 10 ng/ml IFN-γ. SLPI significantly decreased the gene expression of cathepsin S (p = 0.0061). A reduced level of cathepsin S activity was observed when U937 (Fig. 3B) and PBM (Fig. 3D) macrophages were incubated firstly with SPLI follow by IFN-γ, using the cathepsin substrate Z-Phe-Arg-AMC, at pH 7.5. A statistically significant decrease in cathepsin S activity was observed between cells stimulated with 10 ng/ml IFN-γ, and cells incubated with SLPI and IFN-γ (p = 0.0229 and 0.023 for U937s and PBM, respectively). Exposing U937 macrophages to A1AT or elafin prior to IFN-γ stimulation had no significant effect on IFN-γ-induced cathepsin S activity (Fig. 3B). No reduction in MMP-12 was observed when U937 (Fig. 3C) and PBM macrophages (Fig. 3D) were incubated firstly with SPLI follow by IFN-γ. Effect of SLPI on IFN-γ-signaling Pathways in Macrophages—SLPI inhibited IFN-γ-induced Iκ-Bβ degradation (Fig. 4A). Similarly NF-κB activation was observed after 3 h in the presence of IFN-γ (Fig. 4B) and IFN-γ-induced NF-κB nuclear translocation was increased 2-fold compared with control. IFN-γ-induced NF-κB activation was also inhibited by SLPI. SN50, a cell-permeable peptide that inhibits NF-κB nuclear translocation downstream of IKK, and its mutant peptide, NF-κB SN50M, were used to investigate whether inhibition of NF-κB could reduce IFN-γ-induced protease expression. SN50 was able to inhibit IFN-γ-induced cathepsin S (Fig. 4C, p = 0.022) demonstrating that IFN-γ signals via NF-κB to induce cathepsin S expression in macrophages. Proteases have been implicated in COPD as a cause of airway inflammation and parenchymal destruction (2Saetta M. Di Stefano A. Turato G. Facchini F.M. Corbino L. Mapp C.E. Maestrelli P. Ciaccia A.

Care Med. 1995; 152: 1666-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Although a prominent role for NE has been postulated in COPD for many years, recent work has demonstrated that cathepsins and matrix metalloproteases, produced primarily by macrophages, are also important (31Molet S. Belleguic C. Lena H. Germain N. Bertrand C.P. Shapiro S.D. Planquois J.M. Delaval P. Lagente V. Inflamm. Res. 2005; 54: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In addition to macrophages and neutrophils as modulators of inflammation in COPD, an increasing number of authors have described an important role for lymphocytes (2Saetta M. Di Stefano A. Turato G. Facchini F.M. Corbino L. Mapp C.E. Maestrelli P. Ciaccia A. Fabbri L.M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1998; 157: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 3Lams B.E. Sousa A.R. Rees P.J.

Pare P.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 2645-2653Crossref PubMed Scopus (2947) Google Scholar). We postulated that increased IFN-γ observed in COPD would induce expression of these proteases (cathepsins and MMPs). This study demonstrates significantly elevated levels of IFN-γ, cathepsin S, and MMP-12 in COPD BAL fluid compared with control BAL fluid We have further demonstrated that incubation of macrophages with IFN-γ leads to increased cathepsin S and MMP-12 expression and that the neutralization of IFN-γ activity in COPD BAL fluid decreases COPD BAL fluid-induced cathepsin S and MMP-12 expression by macrophages. Finally, we have demonstrated that SLPI can down-regulate IFN-γ-induced protease production, via inactivation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Therefore, these studies provide molecular and clinical data to support the view that IFN-γ up-regulation leads to expression of proteases responsible for lung tissue damage in COPD and that this is remediable by the anti-inflammatory effects of SLPI. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are increased in the COPD lung, with CD8+ cells being predominant (33Saetta M. Baraldo S. Corbino L. Turato G. Braccioni F. Rea F. Cavallesco G. Tropeano G. Mapp C.E. Maestrelli P. Ciaccia A. Fabbri L.M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1999; 160: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) evidence that COPD is predominantly a Th1 driven condition. In general, Th1 responses preferentially stimulate genes that are involved in apoptosis and tissue injury (34Sandler N.G. Mentink-Kane M.M. Cheever A.W. Wynn T.A. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 3655-3667Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The Th1 cells observed in COPD are the major potential source of IFN-γ in the lungs. It has been shown that some of the mediators involved in the inflammatory process observed in emphysematous tissues can directly induce emphysema. IFN-γ is one of those candidates. Transgenic overexpression of IFN-γ in the adult murine lung results in pulmonary emphysema (35Wang Z. Zheng T. Zhu Z. Homer R.J. Riese R.J. Chapman Jr., H.A. Shapiro S.D. Elias J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1587-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). BAL fluids from the overexpressing IFN-γ mice have increased neutrophil and lymphocyte levels and an exaggerated number of macrophages compared with controls (35Wang Z. Zheng T. Zhu Z. Homer R.J. Riese R.J. Chapman Jr., H.A. Shapiro S.D. Elias J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1587-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Elevated levels of IFN-γ alter the pulmonary protease/antiprotease balance in a proteolytic direction via the induction of MMPs and a variety of cathepsins (35Wang Z. Zheng T. Zhu Z. Homer R.J. Riese R.J. Chapman Jr., H.A. Shapiro S.D. Elias J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1587-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Production of high amounts of IFN-γ (∼20 ng/ml) has been reported with dendritic cell populations after stimulation with IL-12/IL-18 (7Ohteki T. Fukao T. Suzue K. Maki C. Ito M. Nakamura M. Koyasu S. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1981-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 36Schleicher U. Hesse A. Bogdan C. Blood. 2005; 105: 1319-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 37Hochrein H. Shortman K. Vremec D. Scott B. Hertzog P. O'Keeffe M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5448-5455Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). In this study cathepsin S and MMP-12 gene expressions and protein activity were increased in macrophages exposed to IFN-γ. This increase in proteases can have a major impact on innate host defenses in the lung, as we have previously shown that cathepsin S can cleave and inactivate human β-defensin 2 and 3 (21Taggart C.C. Lowe G.J. Greene C.M. Mulgrew A.T. O'Neill S.J. Levine R.L. McElvaney N.G. J. Biol.

Brewer M.T. Thompson R.C. Crystal R.G. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 87: 2207-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The cleavage of SLPI by cathepsin S results in the loss of the active site of SLPI and the inactivation of SLPI antineutrophil elastase capacity, further worsening the potential protease burden. IFN-γ also down-regulates SLPI (26Odaka C. Mizuochi T. Yang J. Ding A. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 1507-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 38Ma B. Kang M.J. Lee C.G. Chapoval S. Liu W.

Investig. 2005; 115: 3460-3472Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) via CCR-5, and we have previously shown decreased levels of SLPI in the COPD lung mediated in part by cathepsin degradation (21Taggart C.C. Lowe G.J. Greene C.M. Mulgrew A.T. O'Neill S.J. Levine R.L. McElvaney N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33345-33352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Cathepsin S has been identified as the dominant endocytic protease that is specifically up-regulated under inflammatory conditions in the presence of IFN-γ (39Wiendl H. Lautwein A. Mitsdorffer M. Krause S. Erfurth S. Wienhold W. Morgalla M. Weber E. Overkleeft H.S. Lochmuller H. Melms A. Tolosa E. Driessen C. J. Neuroimmunol. 2003; 138: 132-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cathepsin S up-regulation in COPD is extremely relevant in the context of recent data showing that cathepsin S inhibition (and a null mutation of cathepsin S) decreases IFN-γ-induced DNA injury, apoptosis, emphysema, inflammation, and protease accumulation in a murine pulmonary emphysema modeling system (40Zheng T. Kang M.J. Crothers K. Zhu Z. Liu W. Lee C.G. Rabach L.A. Chapman H.A. Homer R.J. Aldous D. Desanctis G. Underwood S. Graupe M. Flavell R.A. Schmidt J.A. Elias J.A. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 8106-8115Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). MMP-12 has also been implicated the pathogenesis of chronic lung injury, particularly emphysema. MMP–12 is elevated in the lungs of COPD patients (31Molet S. Belleguic C. Lena H. Germain N. Bertrand C.P. Shapiro S.D. Planquois J.M. Delaval P. Lagente V. Inflamm. Res. 2005; 54: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Interestingly, MMP-12 knock-out mice do not develop air space enlargement in response to smoke exposure, implicating MMP-12 in development of cigarette smoke induced emphysema (12Hautamaki R.D. Kobayashi D.K. Senior R.M. Shapiro S.D. Science. 1997; 277: 2002-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). The increased expression of this important MMP in our study driven by IFN-γ is therefore of interest. SLPI possesses anti-inflammatory activity (41Hiemstra P.S. Fernie-King B.A. McMichael J. Lachmann P.J. Sallenave J.M. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2004; 10: 2891-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). LPS hyporesponsive cells transcribe SLPI and transfection of macrophages with SLPI suppresses LPS-induced activation of NF-κB, production of nitric oxide and TNF-α by an unknown mechanism (25Jin F.Y. Nathan C. Radzioch D. Ding A. Cell. 1997; 88: 417-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). IFN-γ can suppress expression of SLPI and restore LPS responsiveness to SLPI-producing cells (25Jin F.Y. Nathan C. Radzioch D. Ding A. Cell. 1997; 88: 417-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that SLPI can inhibit LPS and lipoteichoic acid (LTA)-induced NF-κB activation in monocytic cells by preventing degradation of key regulatory proteins, like IκBα and IκBβ (42Taggart C.C. Greene C.M. McElvaney N.G. O'Neill S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33648-33653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 43Greene C.M. McElvaney N.G. O'Neill S.J. Taggart C.C. Infect Immun. 2004; 72: 3684-3687Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). SLPI prevents the degradation of IκBα and β without affecting IκBα phosphorylation and ubiquitination (42Taggart C.C. Greene C.M. McElvaney N.G. O'Neill S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33648-33653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). SLPI inhibition of IFN-γ-induced IκB β-degradation and NF-κB activation is due to the anti-inflammatory activity of SLPI (28Taggart C.C. Cryan S.A. Weldon S. Gibbons A. Greene C.M. Kelly E. Low T.B. O'Neill S.J. McElvaney N.G. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 1659-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). SLPI ability to inhibit IFN-γ-induced NF-kB activation also resulted in decreased cathepsin S expression but not MMP-12 production. The inability of SLPI to inhibit IFN-γ-induced MMP-12 may be due in part to activation of MMP-12 expression via another transcription factor pathway other than NF-κB. Recently, Churg et al. (44Churg A. Wang X. Wang R.D. Meixner S.C. Pryzdial E.L. Wright J.L. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2007; 37: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that another anti-protease, A1AT, can inhibit cigarette smoke induced MMP-12 and TNF-α via inactivation of PAR-1 by inhibiting thrombin and plasmin. This further demonstrates the important anti-inflammatory functions of classically described antiproteases. Further investigation of the interaction of SLPI with the IFN-γ pathway would be beneficial. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that a Th1 response leads to increased production of a spectrum of proteases driven by IFN-γ. Inhibition of IFN-γ in COPD BAL fluid inhibits this process. Therefore, by minimizing the IFN-induced protease expression, SLPI is of potential therapeutic relevance in the treatment of COPD."
https://openalex.org/W2150897994,"Psoriasis is a chronic skin disorder with multifactorial etiology. In a recent study, we reported results of a genome-wide scan on 46 French extended families presenting with plaque psoriasis. In addition to unambiguous linkage to the major susceptibility locus PSORS1 on Chromosome 6p21, we provided evidence for a susceptibility locus on Chromosome 20p13. To follow up this novel psoriasis susceptibility locus we used a family-based association test (FBAT) for an association scan over the 17 Mb candidate region. A total of 85 uncorrelated SNP markers located in 65 genes of the region were initially investigated in the same set of large families used for the genome wide search, which consisted of 295 nuclear families. When positive association was obtained for a SNP, candidate genes nearby were explored more in detail using a denser set of SNPs. Thus, the gene ADAM33 was found to be significantly associated with psoriasis in this family set (The best association was on a 3-SNP haplotype P = 0.00004, based on 1,000,000 permutations). This association was independent of PSORS1. ADAM33 has been previously associated with asthma, which demonstrates that immune system diseases may be controlled by common susceptibility genes with general effects on dermal inflammation and immunity. The identification of ADAM33 as a psoriasis susceptibility gene identified by positional cloning in an outbred population should provide insights into the pathogenesis and natural history of this common disease."

As a proof-of-concept, this novel method, which employs a Connector Inversion Probe (CIPer), was tested as a genetic tool for pathogen diagnosis, typing, and antibiotic resistance screening with two distinct systems: i) a conserved sequence primer system for genotyping Human Papillomavirus (HPV), a cancer-associated viral agent and ii) screening for antibiotic resistance mutations in the bacterial pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae. We also discuss future applications and advances of the CIPer technology such as integration with digital amplification and next-generation sequencing methods. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of two-dimension informational barcodes, i.e. “multiplex multiplexing padlocks” (MMPs). For the readers' convenience, we also provide an on-line tutorial with user-interface software application CIP creator 1.0.1, for custom probe generation from virtually any new or established primer-pairs."
https://openalex.org/W1995678871,"One of the most fascinating features of amyloid fibrils is their generic cross-β architecture that can be formed from many different and completely unrelated proteins. Nonetheless, amyloid fibrils with diverse structural and phenotypic properties can form, both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>, from the same protein sequence. Here, we have exploited the power of RNA selection techniques to isolate small, structured, single-stranded RNA molecules known as aptamers that were targeted specifically to amyloid-like fibrils formed <i>in vitro</i> from β<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin (β<sub>2</sub>m), the amyloid fibril protein associated with dialysis-related amyloidosis. The aptamers bind with high affinity (apparent <i>K<sub>D</sub></i> ∼ nm) to β<sub>2</sub>m fibrils with diverse morphologies generated under different conditions <i>in vitro</i>, as well as to amyloid fibrils isolated from tissues of dialysis-related amyloidosis patients, demonstrating that they can detect conserved epitopes between different fibrillar species of β<sub>2</sub>m. Interestingly, the aptamers also recognize some other, but not all, amyloid fibrils generated <i>in vitro</i> or isolated from <i>ex vivo</i> sources. Based on these observations, we have shown that although amyloid fibrils share many common structural properties, they also have features that are unique to individual fibril types."

We sought to explore the effectiveness of Naturopathic care on chronic low back pain.This study was a randomized clinical trial. We randomized 75 postal employees with low back pain of longer than six weeks duration to receive Naturopathic care (n = 39) or standardized physiotherapy (n = 36) over a period of 12 weeks. The study was conducted in clinics on-site in postal outlets. Participants in the Naturopathic care group received dietary counseling, deep breathing relaxation techniques and acupuncture. The control intervention received education and instruction on physiotherapy exercises using an approved education booklet. We measured low back pain using the Oswestry disability questionnaire as the primary outcome measure, and quality of life using the SF-36 in addition to low back range of motion, weight loss, and Body Mass Index as secondary outcomes.Sixty-nine participants (92%) completed eight weeks or greater of the trial. Participants in the Naturopathic care group reported significantly lower back pain (-6.89, 95% CI. -9.23 to -3.54, p = <0.0001) as measured by the Oswestry questionnaire. Quality of life was also significantly improved in the group receiving Naturopathic care in all domains except for vitality. Differences for the aggregate physical component of the SF-36 was 8.47 (95% CI, 5.05 to 11.87, p = <0.0001) and for the aggregate mental component was 7.0 (95% CI, 2.25 to 11.75, p = 0.0045).

https://openalex.org/W2015003693,"Gene expression programs are established by networks of interacting transcription factors. The basic helix-loop-helix factor SCL and the LIM-only protein LMO2 are components of transcription factor complexes that are essential for hematopoiesis. Here we show that LMO2 and SCL are predominant interaction partners in hematopoietic cells and that this interaction occurs through a conserved interface residing in the loop and helix 2 of SCL. This interaction nucleates the assembly of SCL complexes on DNA and is required for target gene induction and for the stimulation of erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation. We also demonstrate that SCL determines LMO2 protein levels in hematopoietic cells and reveal that interaction with SCL prevents LMO2 degradation by the proteasome. We propose that the SCL-LMO2 interaction couples protein stabilization with higher order protein complex assembly, thus providing a powerful means of modulating the stoichiometry and spatiotemporal activity of SCL complexes. This interaction likely provides a rate-limiting step in the transcriptional control of hematopoiesis and leukemia, and similar mechanisms may operate to control the assembly of diverse protein modules."
https://openalex.org/W2001897837,"Lily pollen tubes grow adhering to an extracellular matrix produced by the transmitting tract epidermis in a hollow style. SCA, a small (∼9.4 kDa), basic protein plus low esterified pectin from this extracellular matrix are involved in the pollen tube adhesion event. The mode of action for this adhesion event is unknown. We partially separated three SCA isoforms from the lily stigma in serial size exclusion column fractions (SCA1, 9370 Da; SCA2, 9384 Da; SCA3, 9484 Da). Peptide sequencing analysis allowed us to determine two amino acid variations in SCA3, compared with SCA1. For SCA2, however, there are more sequence variations yet to be identified. Our structural homology and molecular dynamics modeling results show that SCA isoforms have the plant nonspecific lipid transfer protein-like structure: a globular shape of the orthogonal 4-helix bundle architecture, four disulfide bonds, an internal hydrophobic and solvent-inaccessible cavity, and a long C-terminal tail. The Ala71 in SCA3, replacing the Gly71 in SCA1, has no predictable effect on structure. The Arg26 in SCA3, replacing the Gly26 in SCA1, is predicted to cause structural changes that result in a significantly reduced volume for the internal hydrophobic cavity in SCA3. The volume of the internal cavity fluctuates slightly during the molecular dynamics simulation, but overall, SCA1 displays a larger cavity than SCA3. SCA1 displays higher activity than SCA3 in the in vitro pollen tube adhesion assay. No differences were found between the two SCAs in a binding assay with pectin. The larger size of the hydrophobic cavity in SCA1 correlates with its higher adhesion activity. Lily pollen tubes grow adhering to an extracellular matrix produced by the transmitting tract epidermis in a hollow style.

Peptide sequencing analysis allowed us to determine two amino acid variations in SCA3, compared with SCA1. For SCA2, however, there are more sequence variations yet to be identified. Our structural homology and molecular dynamics modeling results show that SCA isoforms have the plant nonspecific lipid transfer protein-like structure: a globular shape of the orthogonal 4-helix bundle architecture, four disulfide bonds, an internal hydrophobic and solvent-inaccessible cavity, and a long C-terminal tail. The Ala71 in SCA3, replacing the Gly71 in SCA1, has no predictable effect on structure. The Arg26 in SCA3, replacing the Gly26 in SCA1, is predicted to cause structural changes that result in a significantly reduced volume for the internal hydrophobic cavity in SCA3. The volume of the internal cavity fluctuates slightly during the molecular dynamics simulation, but overall, SCA1 displays a larger cavity than SCA3. SCA1 displays higher activity than SCA3 in the in vitro pollen tube adhesion assay. No differences were found between the two SCAs in a binding assay with pectin. The larger size of the hydrophobic cavity in SCA1 correlates with its higher adhesion activity. During lily pollination, pollen tubes are guided to the ovary on an extracellular matrix (ECM) 2The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; MD, molecular dynamics; LTP, nonspecific lipid transfer protein; nsLTP, nonspecific lipid transfer protein; TTE, transmitting tract epidermis; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; ESI, electrospray ionization; MS, mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization; TOF, time-of-flight; SP, stigma protein; ddH2O, double-distilled H2O; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. produced by the specialized stylar transmitting tract epidermis (TTE). This guidance includes an adhesion event between the pollen tube and the TTE (1Lord E.

For the purpose of identifying molecular factors in lily pollen tube adhesion, Jauh et al. (5Jauh G.Y. Eckard K.J. Nothnagel E.A. Lord E.M. Sex Plant Rep. 1997; 10: 173-180Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) developed an in vitro bioassay using ECM molecules attached to a nitrocellulose membrane as an artificial style. Using this in vitro bioassay, two molecules from the style ECM, SCA (stigma/style cysteine-rich adhesin) and a low esterified pectic polysaccharide, were found to be responsible for pollen tube adhesion on the stylar matrix (6Mollet J.C. Park S.Y. Nothnagel E.A. Lord E.M. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1737-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 7Park S.Y. Jauh G.Y. Mollet J.C. Eckard K.J. Nothnagel E.A. Walling L.L. Lord E.M. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 151-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The level of SCA mRNA was high in stigma/style tissue, petal, and young leaf, but it was absent in pollen tubes (8Park S.Y. Lord E.M. Plant Mol. Biol. 2003; 51: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Localization of both SCA and the low esterified pectin on the surface of the stylar TTE supported their involvement in in vivo pollen tube adhesion. The mechanism of action for SCA and pectin in pollen tube adhesion is yet unknown. Neither of these molecules alone is active in the adhesion assay. Only when they were combined did SCA and pectin bind to each other in a pH-dependent manner and form the functional, adhesive matrix (6Mollet J.C. Park S.Y. Nothnagel E.A. Lord E.M. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1737-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The pH effect implies that a charge interaction occurs, rather than a tight cross-linking, between SCA and the low esterified pectin in lily pistils. SCA is a small (∼9.4 kDa), basic protein (pI ∼ 9.0) with around 50% amino acid sequence homology to plant nonspecific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs) (7Park S.Y. Jauh G.Y. Mollet J.C. Eckard K.J. Nothnagel E.A. Walling L.L. Lord E.M. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 151-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plant nsLTPs are small (9-10 kDa) in size, basic (pI 8.8-10) proteins (9Kader J.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 627-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 10Kader J.C. Trends Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 66-70Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (217) Google Scholar). They were named LTPs because of a presumed intracellular function in transport of lipids between organelles. The three-dimensional structures of several known plant nsLTPs show a globular molecule, composed of four α-helices, which are stabilized by four disulfide bridges, and a C-terminal tail (11Shin D.H. Lee J.Y. Hwang K.Y. Kim K.K. Suh S.W. Structure. 1995; 3: 189-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 12Gomar J. Petit M.C. Sodano P. Sy D. Marion D. Kader J.C.

Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The most out-standing feature of this hydrophilic molecule is a hydrophobic cavity that runs through the whole molecule and, in several known cases, is capable of interacting with the acyl-chain of a phospholipid molecule and fatty acids (14Zachowski A. Guerbette F. Grosbois M. Jolliot-Croquin A. Kader J.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 15Hamilton J.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 177-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Plant nsLTPs appear to have no specificity for binding lipids, and they even bind two monoacylated lipid monomers (16Charvolin D. Douliez J.P. Marion D. Cohen-Addad C. Pebay-Peyroula E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 562-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 17Douliez J.P. Michon T. Marion D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1467: 65-72Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 18Douliez J.P. Jegou S. Pato C. Molle D. Tran V. Marion D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) or a diacylated lipid (19Sodano P. Caille A. Sy D. dePerson G. Marion D. Ptak M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 130-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although many LTPs can bind lipids in vitro, no LTP has been shown to do so in vivo. In addition, plant nsLTP family members contain an N-terminal signal peptide that makes mature proteins enter the secretory pathway and be present in the extracellular space (20Bernhard W.R. Thoma S. Botella J. Somerville C.R. Plant Physiol. 1991; 95: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 21Thoma S. Hecht U. Kippers A. Botella J. Devries S. Somerville C. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Therefore, the early assumption that they function intracellularly in lipid transfer is now discredited, and a function in the extracellular matrix or wall is sought. Except for a few cases, the biological functions of plant nsLTPs are unknown. Some LTPs have been shown to have potent antimicrobial (22Molina A. GarciaOlmedo F. Plant J. 1997; 12: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) or antifungal activity (23Phillippe B. Cammue B.P.A. Thevissen K. Hendriks M. Eggermont K. Goderis I.J. Proost P. Vandamme J. Osborn R.W. Guerbette F. Kader J.C. Broekaert W.F. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 445-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). A putative lipid transfer protein, DIR-1, was recently shown to be involved in systemic resistance in Arabidopsis (24Maldonado A.M. Doerner P. Dixon R.A. Lamb C.J. Cameron R.K. Nature. 2002; 419: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). A tobacco LTP was shown to mediate cell wall loosening in vitro (25Nieuwland J. Feron R. Huisman B.A.H. Fasolino A. Hilbers C.W. Derksen J. Mariani C. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 2009-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In our work, SCA, a lily LTP, has been shown to act with pectin in forming an adhesive stigma/stylar matrix for pollen tube guidance (6Mollet J.C. Park S.Y. Nothnagel E.A. Lord E.M. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1737-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 7Park S.Y. Jauh G.Y. Mollet J.C. Eckard K.J. Nothnagel E.A. Walling L.L. Lord E.M. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 151-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Low molecular mass (7-10 kDa) lily stigma protein fractions (stigma proteins (SPs)) were previously prepared using ion exchange and size exclusion chromatography (7Park S.Y. Jauh G.Y. Mollet J.C. Eckard K.J. Nothnagel E.A. Walling L.L. Lord E.M. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 151-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kim S. Mollet J.C. Dong J. Zhang K.L. Park S.Y. Lord E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 16125-16130Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The major peak found in the HPLC profile of the SPs was identified as SCA (HPLC-SCA) (26Kim S. Mollet J.C. Dong J. Zhang K.L. Park S.Y. Lord E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 16125-16130Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The theoretical mass of SCA was calculated as 9371 Da, with eight cysteine residues in an oxidized status, based upon deduced peptide sequences from a previously cloned SCA cDNA from the lily stigma (7Park S.Y. Jauh G.Y. Mollet J.C. Eckard K.J. Nothnagel E.A. Walling L.L. Lord E.M. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 151-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ESI-MS analysis showed that the HPLC-SCA peak contained major masses of 9369.5 and 9385.3 Da (methionine-oxidized form of SCA with a 16-Da mass increase (MSO)). However, there were two other SCA-like masses also present in the HPLC-SCA peaks (9384 and 9484 Da) (26Kim S. Mollet J.C. Dong J. Zhang K.L. Park S.Y. Lord E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 16125-16130Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In addition to the three putative SCA isoforms identified, several other proteins with masses ranging between 5170 and 9898 Da were also found in the SPs. Among them, a small peak was identified as chemocyanin (9.8 kDa), another secreted protein in the lily stigma that functions in pollen tube guidance (26Kim S. Mollet J.C. Dong J. Zhang K.L. Park S.Y. Lord E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 16125-16130Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Although we have identified putative isoforms of SCA present in the lily stigma, we were not able to proceed further to identify their sequence differences from the originally sequenced SCA nor to do functional analysis of the isoforms using our adhesion assay. This was due to difficulties in separating the HPLC-SCA peaks. In the current study, we succeeded in partially separating SCA isoforms from the lily stigma using size exclusion chromatography and identifying them using ESI-MS analysis, following HPLC purification. Following the partial separation of isoforms, ESI-MS/MS analysis with trypsin digestion helped us to verify the amino acid differences among the isoforms. We were able to determine the primary sequence for SCA3, but we achieved complete sequences for only a signature peptide from SCA2. Complete sequencing of SCA2 remains to be accomplished. We used computational analyses to generate homology/MD structures for the two sequenced SCA isoforms (SCA1 and SCA3), demonstrating that one amino acid change can cause a significant structural change in the molecule, especially in the size of the internal hydrophobic cavity. This difference in structure correlates with a difference in activity of the two isoforms in the in vitro pollen tube adhesion assay. The significance of the structural change is discussed in light of our recent studies on the interaction between SCA and the pollen tube (27Kim S.T. Zhang K.L. Dong J. Lord E.M. Plant Physiol. 2006; 142: 1397-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Plants—Lilium longiflorum Thunb. plants (cvs. Nellie White and Snow Queen) were grown in the green house at the University of California, Riverside. Stigmas were collected within 5 days after anthesis and stored at -80 °C until used for protein preparation. For in vitro adhesion assays, fresh pollen was used from anthers at 2-3 days after anthesis. Preparation of Lily Stigma Proteins—The protein purification was done by the method previously described (26Kim S. Mollet J.C. Dong J. Zhang K.L. Park S.Y. Lord E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 16125-16130Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), with a few modifications. Briefly, 64 g of frozen stigmas were ground in phosphate-buffered saline (0.14 m NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, and 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4), and proteins were precipitated with a stepwise gradient of (NH4)2SO4 (25-90%). All precipitates were pooled and dialyzed against ddH2O (MilliQ; Millipore). The proteins were applied to a CM-Sephadex C-25 cation exchange column (20 mm MES buffer, pH 5.6) and serially eluted with 0.1, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 m NaCl in 20 mm MES buffer. The fractions containing SCA were identified by Western blots and further fractionated on an acrylamide Bio-gel P10 column (120 × 1 cm; Bio-Rad). We refer to these size column fractions as SPs, which mainly contain SCA (over 90%), with some other small, extracellular proteins. The crude stigma proteins were obtained from a single stigma of either Nellie White or Snow Queen at 3 days after anthesis. Fresh stigma tissue was ground in phosphate-buffered saline buffer (0.14 m NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, and 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4). Larger sized molecules were excluded by a precipitation with 70% methanol. The supernatant solution, containing relatively small sized molecules, was incubated with CM-Sephadex C-25 beads in 20 mm MES buffer, pH 5.6, at 4 °C for 30 min. Any unbound proteins were washed from the resins with 20 mm MES buffer, pH 5.6, and the bound proteins were eluted using 0.5 m NaCl. After dialysis against ddH2O, crude stigma protein samples were subjected to ESI-MS analysis. HPLC Purification of SCA—SPs were further purified by HPLC (Agilent 1100; Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA) with a Jupiter C4 microbore column (2 × 250 mm, 5-μm particle diameter, 100-Å pore size; Phenomenex, Belmont, CA) to obtain pure SCA proteins (referred to as HPLC-SCAs). SPs (∼50 μg), dissolved in water, were injected into the HPLC column, and proteins were eluted with a two-step linear gradient at a flow rate of 50 μl/min from a 5% mobile phase B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in CH3CN) to 45% B for 30 min, holding at 45% B for 5 min and then ramping to 90% B for another 50 min. The peaks corresponding to SCA were collected, evaporated, and then redissolved in 0.1% formic acid in an appropriate volume of acetonitrile/H2O (50:50, v/v) for mass spectrometric analysis of protein molecular weight. In addition, an aliquot of the fractions was dissolved in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate for enzymatic digestion and applied to mass spectrometric sequence analysis. HPLC-SCAs were used for production of polyclonal SCA antibodies as well as for all in vitro bioassays and mass spectrometry in this study. Purification of Low Esterified Pectins from the Lily Style—Lily stylar pectins, used for all in vitro bioassays, were prepared by following the previously established method (6Mollet J.C. Park S.Y. Nothnagel E.A. Lord E.M. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1737-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly, fresh lily styles were cut into 1.5-cm segments and then cut in half lengthwise to expose the TTE. The style segments were continuously stirred for 30 min at 70 °C with PAW reagent (250 ml of 80% phenol and 100 ml of acetic acid). The extract was filtered through a Büchner funnel (with filter paper) and discarded. The style fragments were recovered and rinsed serially with ddH2O, 95% EtOH, and ddH2O. The style segments were continuously stirred for 16 h at room temperature in 500 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.0 (0.02% NaN3) buffer. The extract was filtered and saved for a centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was dialyzed against ddH2O and added to imidazole-HCl, pH 7.0, buffer for a final concentration of 100 mm. The sample was then applied to an anion exchange column (Q-Sepharose) and eluted with a serial imidazole gradient (250 mm, 500 mm, 1 m, and 1.5 m). The elute, which was active in the in vitro bioassay, was further fractionated using a size exclusion column (Sepharose CL-6B). All fractions collected were applied for phenol sulfuric (28Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (40861) Google Scholar) and meta-hydroxybiphenyl (29Blumenkr N. Asboehan G. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 54: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (5967) Google Scholar) assays to determine the carbohydrate profile. The adhesive fractions were pooled. After dialysis against ddH2O and freeze-dry concentration, the 1-ml aliquots of low esterified pectin samples were kept at -20 °C, until used for the bioassay. In Vitro Pollen Tube Adhesion Assay—The pollen tube adhesion assay followed a previous method with a few modifications (7Park S.Y. Jauh G.Y. Mollet J.C. Eckard K.J. Nothnagel E.A. Walling L.L. Lord E.M. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 151-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HPLC-purified SCA proteins were vacuum-dried and redissolved in water. 10 μg of proteins, determined by the Lowry modified protein assay (Pierce), were combined with 40 μg of lily stylar pectin. SCA/pectin mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 15 min and transferred onto nitrocellulose using a dot blotter with six 0.8-mm diameter wells. The nitrocellulose membranes were air-dried, and pregerminated pollen tubes (2-3 h) in germination medium were laid on top of the SCA/pectin matrix in a Petri dish and incubated at room temperature in the dark for an additional 5 h without any disturbance. The membranes were gently washed with germination medium and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and the number of bound pollen tubes was counted under a dissecting microscope. In Vitro Pectin Binding Assay—5 μg of HPLC-SCA was incubated with 40 μg of stylar pectins at room temperature for 30 min in a total 100 μl of reaction volume. A 10-μl aliquot from each reaction sample was saved as a loading control, and 90 μl of the SCA/pectin mixture was applied to the 100 kDa cut-off spin column (Microcon; Millipore). Any proteins released from the pectin matrix were passed through the column by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min. Proteins that were tightly bound to pectins (retentates) and left over on top of the column were recovered by 90 μl of ddH2O. To ensure 100% recovery of the retentates, 90 μl of 1 m NaCl was used for the final elution (elutes). 10 μl of aliquots from the control, retentates, and elutes were applied to SDS-PAGE, and the amount of pectin-binding SCA was evaluated in Western blots using SCA antibodies. To determine what ionic strength is required for the interaction of SCA with pectin, Bio-gel P10 size column fractions 28 (SCA1-enriched SPs) and 31 (SCA3-enriched SPs) were mixed with stylar pectins, respectively. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, each SCA/pectin mixture was loaded on top of the 100 kDa cut-off spin column. Elutions were repeated using each NaCl (from 0 to 1000 mm) to determine at which ionic strength SCA proteins are eluted from the pectin matrices. The retentate after the final elution was also recovered by 90 μl of ddH2O to ensure that there is no protein left over on the pectin matrix. All serial elutes were applied to SDS-PAGE and SCA proteins that detached from the pectin matrix at a certain ionic strength were detected using Western blots. Production of Polyclonal Antibodies and Western Blotting—Highly specific antibodies against pure SCA were generated by an injection of HPLC-SCA into rabbits (Cocalico Biologicals Inc.). Chemocyanin antibodies were made against the recombinant His-tagged protein (30Dong J. Kim S.T. Lord E.M. Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 778-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Both antibodies have high specificity to each protein without showing any cross-reactivity (Fig. S1). Among several fractions of SPs obtained through ion and size columns, SCA-enriched fractions were identified by Western blotting using polyclonal SCA antibodies. Proteins, dissolved in ddH2O, were combined with an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% (v/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 10 mm dithiothreitol), boiled at 95 °C for 5 min, and separated by 15% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting. Nonspecific antibody interactions were preblocked by 5% (w/v) dry milk powder in Tris-buffered saline plus Tween 20 (20 mm Tris-HCl and 0.2 m sodium chloride at pH 7.6 with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20). The membrane was treated with 1:1000 dilutions of the primary antibodies. The signal was detected with secondary goat anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with a horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad) using the Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (Bio-Rad). ESI-MS Analysis of HPLC-purified SCAs—The molecular weight of intact proteins was measured by nanoelectrospray ionization ion source by using a quadrupole-time-of-flight Ultima-global mass spectrometer (Waters, Manchester, UK). About 5 μl of proteins purified from HPLC were loaded into the nanoelectrospray tip (Protana, Odense, Denmark) for ESI-MS analysis. The acquired spectra were further processed using the MAXENT_1 deconvolution software within the instrument control software MASSLYNX to reconstruct the multiple charged ion mass spectra to the singly charged ion mass spectra for the observation of the monoisotopic mass of proteins. Relative quantification of SCA isoforms was determined through the monoisotopic peak ratio of the postdeconvolution spectra corresponding to the SCA isoforms. Peptide Sequence Analysis by Liquid Chromatography-MS/MS—SCA fractions collected from HPLC were dissolved in 20 μl of 25 mm NH4HCO3. After reduction of cysteine residues by incubation with 25 μl of 10 mm dithiothreitol for 45 min at 57 °C and alkylation by reaction with 25 μl of 55 mm iodoacetamide in the dark for 1 h, proteins were digested with trypsin (modified sequencing grade; Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C overnight, dried, redissolved in 10 μl of water, and injected into an HPLC column for liquid chromatography-MS/MS analysis. The liquid chromatography-MS/MS experiments were performed on an HP 1100 capillary high performance liquid chromatograph (Hewlett-Packard) using a 0.3 × 150-mm column (Zorbax SB-C18, 5 μm; Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) at a flow rate of 6 μl/min with multiple steps of a gradient from 2 to 90% mobile phase B over 100 min. Mobile phase B is 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in H2O. Mobile phase B was 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in acetonitrile. The high performance liquid chromatograph was connected on-line to a Waters hybrid quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Waters, Manchester, UK). The quadrupole-time-of-flight method utilized consisted of a survey scan mode in the mass range from 300 to 1400, during which up to four precursor ions were selected for parallel collision dissociation analysis using an automated data-dependent switching function, either MS to MS/MS or MS/MS to MS. Precursor ions were fragmented using an m/z-dependent collision energy applied linearly from 20 to 42 V from 300 to 1400 m/z (optimized for doubly charged ions). Product ion scans were measured in the range from m/z 50 to 1900. Fragmented peptides were manually analyzed to determine the peptide sequences (de novo sequencing). MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry—A 0.5-μl aliquot of the trypsin digest of each HPLC-purified SCA fraction was mixed with 0.5 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamide acid matrix (Sigma) and subjected to MALDI analysis. Mono-isotopic m/z values of all peptides were measured by MALDI using a Voyager DE-STR Biospectrometry work station (ABI, Palo Alto, CA) with delayed extraction operated in the reflectron mode. Computational Studies—Structural homology modeling for SCA1 and SCA3 was performed using the SWISS-MODEL Web server (31Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4505) Google Scholar). Several structures of plant nonspecific LTP from the Protein Data Bank (32Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z.

The high sequence identity between SCA proteins and these plant nsLTPs (38-58%; see Fig. 4) allowed us to perform homology modeling to predict their structures. It is generally accepted that sequence identity at 40% or higher allows for the prediction of the structural motif of an unknown structure with high confidence (36Petsko G. Ringe D. Protein Structure and Function. Sinauer/New Science Press, London, UK2004Google Scholar). The presence of four disulfide bonds further boosts our confidence for the correctness of the structural motif. The disulfide bonds restrict the flexibility of SCAs and nsLTPs in general and, together with the hydrophobic core, contribute to enhanced protein stability. Nevertheless, we deemed it necessary to perform short time molecular dynamics simulations to further relax the predicted structures and to optimize the backbone and side chain conformations and the relative topologies of elements of secondary structure.FIGURE 4Amino acid sequence of SCA isoforms and other plant nsLTPs. SCA-like nsLTPs were obtained from a BlastP search (63Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol.

Limited proteolysis at Arg709, Arg1018, and Arg1545 by thrombin or Factor Xa (FXa) results in the generation of activated FV, which serves as a cofactor of FXa in prothrombin activation. Both thrombin exosites I and II have been reported to be involved in FV activation, but the relative importance of these regions in the individual cleavages remains unclear. To investigate the role of each exosite in FV activation, we have used recombinant FV molecules with only one of the three activation cleavage sites available, in combination with exosite I- or II-specific aptamers. In addition, structural requirements for exosite interactions located in the B-domain of FV were probed using FV B-domain deletion mutants and comparison with FV activating enzymes from the venom of Russell's viper (RVV-V) and of Levant's viper (LVV-V) known to activate FV by specific cleavage at Arg1545. Our results indicate that thrombin exosite II is not involved in cleavage at Arg709 and that both thrombin exosites are important for recognition and cleavage at Arg1545. Efficient thrombin-catalyzed FV activation requires both the N- and C-terminal regions of the B-domain, whereas only the latter is required by RVV-V and LVV-V. This indicates that proteolysis of FV by thrombin at Arg709, Arg1018, and Arg1545 show different cleavage requirements with respect to interactions mediated by thrombin exosites and areas that surround the respective cleavage sites. In addition, interactions between exosite I of thrombin and FV are primarily responsible for the different cleavage site specificity as compared with activation by RVV-V or LVV-V.

Pittman D.D. Toole J.J. Kriz R.W. Aldape R.A. Hewick R.M. Kaufman R.J. Mann K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4846-4850Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). FV, which has little or no intrinsic procoagulant cofactor activity, is activated by thrombin or factor Xa (FXa) through limited proteolysis (2Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteolytic activation of FV results in the removal of the FV B-domain and the exposure of regions in the FV molecule that are important for the expression of its procoagulant activity (3Steen M. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38424-38430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 4Toso R. Camire R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21643-21650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Activated FV (FVa) is a heterodimer that consists of a heavy chain (A3-A2 domains) and a light chain (A1-C1-C2 domains) that are noncovalently associated in a calcium-dependent manner (5Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 964-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hibbard L.S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 638-645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FVa is the essential nonenzymatic cofactor of the prothrombinase complex, which upon complex formation with FXa accelerates FXa-catalyzed prothrombin activation in the presence of calcium ions and a phospholipid membrane surface by several orders of magnitude (2Nesheim M.E.

Chem. 1980; 255: 274-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although FV can be activated by a number of proteases (8Monkovic D.D. Tracy P.B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1118-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 9Tans G. Nicolaes G.A. Thomassen M.C. Hemker H.C. van Zonneveld A.J. Pannekoek H. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15969-15972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thrombin is the most potent physiological activator of FV. Activation of FV by thrombin is achieved through limited proteolysis at Arg709, Arg1018, and Arg1545, of which the cleavage after Arg1545 is required for full expression of FVa activity (10Thorelli E. Kaufman R.J. Dahlbäck B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thrombin-catalyzed activation of FV follows a kinetically preferred order of bond cleavage, in which cleavage at Arg709 occurs first, followed closely by cleavage at Arg1018 and slow cleavage at Arg1545, which results in formation of the FVa light chain (11Suzuki K. Dahlbäck B. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6556-6564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Thorelli E. Kaufman R.J. Dahlbäck B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A characteristic feature of thrombin are two distinct electropositive surface regions, termed exosite I and exosite II, that contribute to the specificity of thrombin by mediating the recognition of its substrates, inhibitors and receptors (13Huntington J.A.

In this study, we have used FV cleavage site mutants in combination with specific thrombin exosite I and II inhibitors to elucidate the importance of each exosite for the individual FV activation cleavages. Furthermore, we have used FV B-domain deletion mutants to probe the structural requirements for thrombin exosite interactions located in the B-domain and compared them with the structural requirements for FV activation by RVV-V and LVV-V, which are snake venom proteases that are known to activate FV by a single cleavage at Arg1545 (19Kisiel W.

Deoxyoligonucleotides GGTTGGTGTGGTTGG (thrombin aptamer I) and AGTCCGTGGTAGGGCAGGTTGGGGTGACT (thrombin aptamer II) were purchased from DNA Technology AIS (Aarhus, Denmark). Proteins—Human FV was purified essentially according to the method of Dahlbäck (23Dahlbäck B. J. Clin. Investig. 1980; 66: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), modified as described (24Nicolaes G.A. Tans G. Thomassen M.C. Hemker H.C. Pabinger I. Varadi K. Schwarz H.P. Rosing J. J. Biol.

Bovine FX was purified according to Fujikawa et al. (25Fujikawa K. Legaz M.E. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4882-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). FXa was prepared from FX after activation by RVV-X (26Fujikawa K. Legaz M.E. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4892-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Human prothrombin was purified according to the method of Di Scipio et al. (27Di Scipio R.G. Hermodson M.A. Yates S.G. Davie E.W.

The monoclonal antibody HV1 specific for the human FV C2 domain was from Sigma and was biotinylated using the Pierce EZ-link sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin kit according to the manufacturer’s procedures. Monoclonal antibody 3B1 directed against the heavy chain of human FV was a kind gift from Prof. B. N. Bouma. Protein Concentration Determination—Thrombin concentrations were determined using the chromogenic substrate S2238 (7Rosing J. Tans G. Govers-Riemslag J.W. Zwaal R.F. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 274-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of the snake venom FV activators RVV-V and LVV-V was measured using the Micro BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. FVa was quantified as described below. Factor Va Assay—FVa cofactor activity was measured via its ability to stimulate FXa-catalyzed thrombin generation as described (24Nicolaes G.A. Tans G. Thomassen M.C. Hemker H.C. Pabinger I. Varadi K. Schwarz H.P. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21158-21166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Unless noted otherwise, prothrombin activation was started by adding prewarmed FV/FVa (∼20 pm) to a reaction mixture containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 μm prothrombin, 5 nm FXa, 40 μm phospholipid vesicles (10% brain phosphatidylserine, 90% egg yolk phosphatidylcholine; mol/mol) and 0.5 mg/ml ovalbumin. The reversible thrombin inhibitor Pefabloc TH (1 μm) was present to avoid feedback activation of FV during the assay. Prothrombin activation was stopped after 1 min by dilution in ice-cold EDTA buffer (50 mm Tris, 175 mm NaCl, 40 mm EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml ovalbumin, pH 7.9). Thrombin was quantified using the chromogenic substrate S2238 (7Rosing J. Tans G. Govers-Riemslag J.W. Zwaal R.F. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 274-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molar FVa concentration in the assay mixture was calculated from the rate of prothrombin activation using a turnover number of 6000 mol of prothrombin activated/min/mole of factor Xa-Va complex (28Tans G. Janssen-Claessen T. Hemker H.C. Zwaal R.F. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21864-21873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipid vesicles were prepared as described (7Rosing J. Tans G. Govers-Riemslag J.W. Zwaal R.F. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 274-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We verified that heparin and the thrombin exosite aptamers did not interfere with the FVa assay. Recombinant FV Variants—FV cDNA constructs containing different combinations of mutated and native amino acids at the three thrombin cleavage sites have been described previously (12Thorelli E. Kaufman R.J. Dahlbäck B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The FV mutants were named according to which amino acid was present at each thrombin cleavage site, i.e. WT FV (Arg709, Arg1018, and Arg1545), RIQ (Arg709, Ile1018, and Gln1545), QRQ (Gln709, Arg1018, and Gln1545), QIR (Gln709, Ile1018, and Arg1545), RIR (Arg709, Ile1018, and Arg1545), QIQ (Gln709, Ile1018, and Gln1545), and QIQQQ (Gln709, Ile1018, Gln1545, Gln1761, and Gln1765). FV constructs lacking the complete B-domain (FV des 709–1545) or the B-domain region from residues 710 to 1477 (FV des 709–1476) were prepared as described (29Marquette K.A. Pittman D.D. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1995; 86: 3026-3034Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The FV construct lacking the B-domain region from residues 828 to 1499 (FV des 827–1498) was made as described (30van der Neut Kolfschoten M. Dirven R.J. Vos H.L. Bertina R.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 89: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Transient Expression of Recombinant FV—Plasmid DNA containing the various FV cDNA constructs was transfected into COS1 cells using the diethylaminoethanol-dextran method (31Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 487-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). As a control, a pMT2-V vector of which the FV cDNA had been excised, through SalI cleavage and religation of the empty vector, was used to transfect cells. The proteins were collected in serum-free medium (Optimem Glutamax). 72 h after transfection, cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the medium was stored at –80 °C. Expression levels of all FV constructs were routinely estimated using the FV-specific ELISA described below. Expression levels of the recombinant FV variants were also determined after complete activation with excess thrombin (5 nm for wild type FV, FV des 827–1498, and the RIR mutant, 10 nm for the remaining FV cleavage site mutants and 50 nm thrombin for FV des 709–1476 and FV des 709–1545 (see also “Results”)), using the above functional assay. FV expression levels were estimated from the FVa cofactor activity reached upon completion of FV activation and calculated relative to the activity of WT FV. No FV(a) was detectable in the mock medium, as judged by both the ELISA and functional activity assay. FV ELISA—FV expression levels were estimated by ELISA using the monoclonal antibody 3B1 as the primary antibody. Microtiter plates were coated overnight with 10 μg/ml of the primary antibody. The plates were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 1% bovine serum albumin pH 7.5 (Hepes-buffered saline-BSA). A standard curve was prepared using pooled normal citrated plasma, assuming the plasma FV concentration to be 21.3 nm (32Tracy P.B. Eide L.L. Bowie E.J. Mann K.G. Blood. 1982; 60: 59-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Standard and samples (diluted in Hepes-buffered saline-BSA) were incubated for 2 h at room temperature, and the plates were then washed three times with 0.05% Tween 20 in Hepes-buffered saline. The biotinylated secondary antibody HV-1 was added (0.55 μg/ml) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, the plates were incubated for 30 min with avidin-horseradish peroxidase (Strep ABC complex/horseradish peroxidase from DAKO, Denmark). After washing, the plates were developed for 10 min with peroxidase substrate solution (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl-benzidene substrate kit; Pierce). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5% (v/v) H2SO4, and the absorbance was measured at 490 nm. To rule out the possibility that the cell culture medium interfered with the ELISA assay, plasma-purified FV was diluted in mock medium or in buffer. No difference was detected between these diluted samples, indicating that the cell culture medium did not interfere with the FV quantitation. Thrombin Activation of FV Cleavage Site Mutants—To determine the thrombin concentration needed to fully activate the FV cleavage site mutants, each of the recombinant FV variants (250 pm in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mg/ml BSA, 5 mm CaCl2) was incubated with increasing concentrations of thrombin (0–50 nm) for 15 min at 37 °C and then assayed for FVa as described above. Inhibition of Thrombin-catalyzed FV Activation by Thrombin Exosite I and II Aptamers—To determine the aptamer concentrations needed for saturation of the inhibitory effect on thrombin-catalyzed activation of FV, 250 pm recombinant wild type FV (in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mg/ml BSA, 5mm CaCl2) was activated with 10 nm thrombin in the presence of increasing concentrations aptamer I, II, or both. At different time points (0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 15 min), FVa concentrations were measured using the assay described above. Role of Thrombin Exosites I and II in FV Activation—To investigate the importance of each of the two exosites of thrombin for the recognition of the individual FV activation cleavage sites, activation of the recombinant FV cleavage site mutants RIQ, QRQ, and QIR (250 pm in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mg/ml BSA, 5 mm CaCl2) by thrombin (10 nm) was followed in the absence and presence of aptamer I (19 μm), aptamer II (5 μm), or both (8.2 μm aptamer I and 5 μm aptamer II). At different time points (0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 15 min), the concentration of FVa generated was measured as described above. Factor V activation rates were determined under initial steady-state second order rate conditions in which the initial rate of FV activation was linear with time and linearly proportional to the concentration of FV between 0 and 0.5 nm, as well as the concentration of thrombin present from 0.05 to 20 nm. SDS-PAGE Analysis of FV Activation in the Absence and Presence of Thrombin Exosite Aptamers—Time courses of activation of plasma-purified FV (75 nm in 50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml polyethylene glycol, pH 7.5) by thrombin were monitored in the absence and presence of thrombin exosite aptamer I (10 μm), aptamer II (5 μm), or both (10 and 5 μm, respectively). Various thrombin concentrations were used such that the effect of aptamers on FV cleavage could be visualized: 0.5 nm (without aptamer and in the presence of aptamer II), 2.5 nm (aptamer I), or 20 nm (in the presence of both aptamers). At various time points, aliquots were taken from the reaction mixtures and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (4–12%) under reducing conditions. Simultaneously, FVa activities were determined as described above. FV fragments were visualized by colloidal blue staining. Characterization of the FV B-domain Deletion Mutants—The recombinant FV B-domain deletion mutants and wild type FV (150 pm in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mg/ml BSA, 5 mm CaCl2) were activated with 0.5 nm thrombin, RVV-V, or LVV-V. At various time points (0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 min) aliquots were withdrawn, and FVa generated was measured. We chose to asses the FVa cofactor activity in assays at 0.5 nm FXa to minimize the intrinsic procoagulant activity reported for recombinant B-domain deleted FV forms (4Toso R. Camire R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21643-21650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 33Kane W.H. Devore-Carter D. Ortel T.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6762-6768Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 34Zhu H. Toso R. Camire R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15033-15039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Under our conditions, activities of unactivated FV were typically <5% for wild type FV and 17–21% for variants lacking the B-domain. Mock conditioned medium gave no measurable FVa activity. Binding of Thrombin, RVV-V and LVV-V to Heparin-Sepharose—Thrombin, RVV-V, or LVV-V (1 ml of 5 nm) in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml BSA) were applied to a 1-ml heparin-Sepharose column that was pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 4 ml of the same buffer followed by elution with a 10-ml linear gradient of 50–1000 mm NaCl. Elution fractions (1 ml) were diluted twice in compensating buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and an appropriate amount of NaCl) to fix the final NaCl concentration in each elution fraction to 500 mm. The presence of FV activator was monitored by the ability of aliquots from the fractions to activate bovine FV. To this end, 50 μl of 20 nm bovine FV in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 20 mm CaCl2 was added to 150 μl of elution fraction. After 10 min of incubation at 37 °C, the FVa generated was measured. During this 10-min incubation period, FVa generation was linear in time for each of the three activators, verifying a linear dependence between FVa activity generated and the amount of FV activator present. Elution profiles were represented as percentages of the amount of FVa generated in the peak fraction. FV Activation in the Presence of Heparin—To investigate the effect of heparin on the activation of 5 nm FV by either thrombin, RVV-V, or LVV-V, FV was incubated with 0.1 nm of each activator in the presence of increasing concentrations of heparin (0–1000 units/ml) in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mg/ml BSA, and 5 mm CaCl2. Samples were taken at different time points during the first 2 min of activation, and the amount of FVa generated was measured. From the resulting progress curves, the initial FV activation rates were calculated (nm FVa/min) and plotted as a function of the heparin concentration. SDS-PAGE Analysis of FV Activation in the Presence of Heparin—To identify fragment generation during FV activation in the presence of heparin, 75 nm plasma-purified human FV (in 50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml polyethylene glycol, with or without 10 units/ml heparin, pH 7.5) was activated with 1 nm thrombin or 5 nm snake venom activator. At various time points, aliquots were removed and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (4–12%) under reducing conditions. Simultaneously, FVa activities were determined as described above. FV fragments were visualized by colloidal blue staining. Role of Thrombin Exosites I and II in FV Activation—To examine the role of thrombin exosites in FV activation, a panel of FV cleavage site mutants was expressed in COS1 cells. The expression levels of the FV variants, as determined by ELISA, were between 0.6 and 1 nm. Thrombin titration was performed to determine the concentration required for full activation of the different mutants (Fig. 1). All of the mutants, except the QIR mutant, reached a maximal and stable level of cofactor activity after 15 min of activation with 5 nm thrombin. A control experiment, with excess thrombin (50 nm) or RVV-V (25 nm), verified that the QIR variant could be completely activated to a stable FVa activity level, corresponding to an activity:antigen ratio that was similar to that of wild type FV (not shown). As expected, incubation of the QIQ and QIQQQ mutants did not result in an increase in FVa cofactor activity, which illustrates that both FV variants are completely resistant to thrombin activation. Full cofactor activity of wild type FV and the RIR variant were observed at low thrombin concentration (typically 1–2 nm). Furthermore, cleavage at Arg709 was more sensitive to thrombin than cleavage at Arg1545 as illustrated by the fact that the RIQ mutant reached maximum activity with 1 nm thrombin, whereas the QIR mutant required 50 nm for full activation within 15 min. Finally, complete activation of the QRQ mutant was observed at 2.5 nm thrombin, but only a slight increase (∼2-fold) in FVa cofactor activity was observed between the fully activated and nonactivated forms. Aptamer titrations were performed to determine the concentration required to inhibit thrombin-catalyzed activation of wild type FV (Fig. 2). The aptamers used are single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides, which have been shown to be specific for thrombin exosite I (aptamer HD1 (35Macaya R.F. Schultze P. Smith F.W. Roe J.A. Feigon J. Proc.

Maximal inhibitory activity of thrombin exosite II aptamer was observed at 5 μm, but this aptamer inhibited the activation of wild type FV only partially. The importance of thrombin exosites I and II for the recognition of the individual FV activation cleavage sites was investigated by monitoring the time course of activation of FV cleavage site mutants with only one thrombin cleavage site available. These time courses were recorded in the absence and presence of aptamer I (19 μm), aptamer II (5 μm), or both (8.2 μm aptamer I and 5 μm aptamer II). Thrombin-catalyzed cleavage at Arg709 (mutant RIQ) was almost completely blocked in the presence of exosite I aptamer, whereas thrombin exosite II aptamer showed a minor effect (Fig. 3, left panel). Although activation of FV mutant QRQ by thrombin-catalyzed cleavage at Arg1018 resulted in only a 2-fold increase of FVa cofactor activity in prothrombin activation, inhibition of activation of this mutant was observed by exosite I aptamer with only a marginal effect by thrombin exosite II aptamer (Fig. 3, middle panel). Activation of FV variant QIR, which can only be cleaved by thrombin at Arg1545, was significantly inhibited by both aptamer I and II, and with both aptamers simultaneously present, thrombin-catalyzed activation was virtually completely inhibited (Fig. 3, right panel). Because the kinetics of the individual cleavage sites are not independent of one another (12Thorelli E. Kaufman R.J. Dahlbäck B. Eur. J.

Thrombin aptamer I (Fig. 4B, upper right panel) decreased the rate of disappearance of single chain FV (330 kDa) and delayed the appearance of the 280-kDa intermediate and the heavy chain (105 kDa), which result from cleavage of single chain FV at Arg709. In addition, the formation of the FVa light chain (71/74 kDa), which is formed after cleavage at Arg1545, was considerably delayed in the presence of aptamer I. Inh"
https://openalex.org/W2153783518,"Dramatic declines of native Hawaiian avifauna due to the human-mediated emergence of avian malaria and pox prompted an examination of whether island taxa share a common altered immunological signature, potentially driven by reduced genetic diversity and reduced exposure to parasites. We tested this hypothesis by characterizing parasite prevalence, genetic diversity and three measures of immune response in two recently-introduced species (Neochmia temporalis and Zosterops lateralis) and two island endemics (Acrocephalus aequinoctialis and A. rimitarae) and then comparing the results to those observed in closely-related mainland counterparts. The prevalence of blood parasites was significantly lower in 3 of 4 island taxa, due in part to the absence of certain parasite lineages represented in mainland populations. Indices of genetic diversity were unchanged in the island population of N. temporalis; however, allelic richness was significantly lower in the island population of Z. lateralis while both allelic richness and heterozygosity were significantly reduced in the two island-endemic species examined. Although parasite prevalence and genetic diversity generally conformed to expectations for an island system, we did not find evidence for a pattern of uniformly altered immune responses in island taxa, even amongst endemic taxa with the longest residence times. The island population of Z. lateralis exhibited a significantly reduced inflammatory cell-mediated response while levels of natural antibodies remained unchanged for this and the other recently introduced island taxon. In contrast, the island endemic A. rimitarae exhibited a significantly increased inflammatory response as well as higher levels of natural antibodies and complement. These measures were unchanged or lower in A. aequinoctialis. We suggest that small differences in the pathogenic landscape and the stochastic history of mutation and genetic drift are likely to be important in shaping the unique immunological profiles of small isolated populations. Consequently, predicting the impact of introduced disease on the many other endemic faunas of the remote Pacific will remain a challenge."

Physiol. 2007; 292: C59-C69Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). De-differentiated cells also show increased expression of growth factor receptors, extracellular matrix, and inflammatory adhesion proteins and have increased proliferative and migratory potential (1Owens G.K.

This phenotypic switching plays an important role in the development of vascular diseases: in acutely injured blood vessels, e.g. after balloon angioplasty, VSMCs proliferate and migrate from the medial layer of the vessel wall contributing to a “neo-intimal” layer, and the majority of SM-like cells found in atherosclerotic plaques appear to represent de-differentiated VSMCs originating from the medial layer (1Owens G.K.

The regulation of VSMC phenotypic switching is complex and mediated by multiple factors, but it is clear that de-differentiated VSMCs are a major cell type responsible for the generation of vascular lesions (2Kawai-Kowase K. Owens G.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: C59-C69Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Compared with normal resting VSMCs in the medial layer, neo-intimal smooth muscle-like cells in vascular lesions show decreased transcription of SM-specific genes such as SM-myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC), SM-α-actin (SMA), and calponin, as well as decreased levels of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) and cGMP-generating soluble guanylate cyclase (2Kawai-Kowase K.

Primary VSMCs cultured in vitro undergo changes similar to those observed in neo-intimal smooth muscle-like cells, including phenotypic de-differentiation, decreased expression of SM-specific genes, and loss of PKG I (3Lincoln T.M.

When these de-differentiated, PKG-deficient VSMCs are transfected with expression vectors encoding PKG I to restore physiologic levels of PKG activity, the cells develop a more contractile phenotype, increase expression of SM-specific genes, and reduce production of extracellular matrix proteins and growth-related genes (3Lincoln T.M.

These results suggest that PKG may contribute to phenotypic switching of VSMCs, but the mechanism(s) whereby PKG regulates SM-specific gene expression remain unknown. In VSMCs, cGMP is generated by nitric oxide (NO) stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase, and by natriuretic peptide activation of receptor guanylate cyclases (12Munzel T. Feil R. Mulsch A. Lohmann S.M. Hofmann F. Walter U. Circulation. 2003; 108: 2172-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The main effect of increased intracellular cGMP is smooth muscle relaxation, mediated by PKG I phosphorylation of multiple target proteins (12Munzel T. Feil R. Mulsch A. Lohmann S.M. Hofmann F. Walter U. Circulation. 2003; 108: 2172-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Mice with homozygous null mutations for PKG I die at an early age from severe intestinal dysfunction due to loss of NO/cGMP-dependent smooth muscle relaxation (13Pfeifer A. Klatt P. Massberg S. Ny L. Sausbier M. Hirneib C. Wang G.-X. Korth M. Aszòdi A. Andersson K.-E. Krombach F. Mayerhofer A. Ruth P. Fassler R. Hofmann F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3045-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, postnatal ablation of PKG I in VSMCs does not lead to hypertension but attenuates development of atherosclerotic lesions in apoE-deficient mice. Analyses of plaque composition in PKG I-deficient and control mice suggest PKG I regulates factors secreted by VSMCs that affect matrix remodeling and recruitment of other plaque cells such as macrophages (14Wolfsgruber W.

Although this study suggests a pro-atherogenic role for PKG I, the preponderance of data suggests that the NO/cGMP/PKG pathway inhibits proliferation and de-differentiation of VSMCs in vitro and limits neo-intimal thickness in various models of arterial injury in vivo (3Lincoln T.M.

All PCR products were sequenced and were identical to published sequences (the GenBank™ accession numbers for murine and rat CRP4 are AK002484 and D17512, respectively; the murine and rat proteins differ by only one amino acid residue). Truncated CRP4 mutants were generated by PCR, and the products were inserted into pXJ40-Myc (37Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Loo T.H. Lim L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 6354-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The plasmid (–2.8 to +3.0) pPromInt-LacZ carrying the SMA promoter and intron I sequence was provided by G. K.

The anti-C-terminal PKG I antibody was from Calbiochem, and an antibody specific for CRP4 was from BD Transduction Laboratories (BD #612079). Antibodies against SRF, RhoA, α-tubulin, glutathione S-transferase (GST), and the HA and Myc epitopes were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). An anti-FLAG antibody was from Sigma, and the anti-phospho-Ser239 VASP antibody was from NanoTools. 8-(4-Chlorophenylthio)guanosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (CPT-cGMP) and 8-(4-chloro-phenylthio)-β-phenyl-1,N2-ethenoguanosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate, Rp isomer (Rp-CPT-PET-cGMPS) were from Biolog. Cell Culture, DNA Transfections, and Reporter Gene Assays—PAC1 rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells were from A. Rothman (39Rothman A. Kulik T.J. Taubman M.B. Berk B.C. Smith W.J. Nadal-Ginard B.

Cells were cultured in Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. CV-1 cells were transfected with 0.8 μg of DNA and 3 μl of Polyfect (Qiagen) per 3.8-cm2 well dish; C3H/10T1/2 cells were transfected with 1.8 μg of DNA, 4 μl of Lipofectamine™, and 8 μl of Plus Reagent™ (Invitrogen) per 6-well dish, according to the manufacturerŉs protocol. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured with luminescence-based assays as described previously (34Casteel D.E. Zhuang S. Gudi T. Tang J. Vuica M. Desiderio S. Pilz R.B. J. Biol.

The target sequence for the CRP4-specific siRNA was 5′-CCAGCUAGUCCUAGAAUUUCA-3′. siRNA oligoribonucleotides, including a control siRNA targeting green fluorescent protein (GFP), were produced by Qiagen. PAC1 cells plated at 8 × 105 cells per 6-well dish were transfected 18 h later (at ∼40% confluency) with 100 pmol of siRNA and 3 μl of Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) in 1 ml of serum-free media per well according to the manufacturerŉs protocol. Full serum-containing media was added 5 h later, and cells were harvested at 48 h. Lentivirus Transduction—The PKG Iα cDNA was subcloned into the feline immunodeficiency virus-based vector pVE-FcIRES-GFPpuro under control of the EF1a promoter. Using calcium phosphate co-precipitation, 293T cells were transfected with either empty vector or the PKG Iα viral transfer vector, together with the feline immunodeficiency virus packaging construct pC34N, pCMV-Rev, and a plasmid encoding a VSV-G-pseudotyped envelope (41Morris K.V.

After 48 h, culture supernatants were filtered, and virus was concentrated by centrifugation for 2 h at 50,000 × g. The concentrated viral suspension was used to infect PAC1 cells overnight (15 μl/ml of culture medium containing 8 μg/ml polybrene). Transduction efficiency was 20–25% as determined by counting GFP-positive cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Quantitative RT-PCR—Total cytoplasmic RNA was extracted using TRI-Reagent™ from Molecular Research Center Inc., and 1 μg of RNA was subjected to reverse transcription with random hexamer primers as described (42Zeng Y.

DNA was denatured at 95 °C for 30 s, with annealing and extension occurring at 60 °C for 45 s; each primer pair generated a single product as determined by analyzing melting curves after a 40-cycle control reaction. Standard curves were generated by plotting Ct values versus the amount of input RNA for each primer pair and demonstrated similar amplification efficiencies. Relative changes in mRNA expression were analyzed using the 2–ΔΔCt method, with GAPDH serving as an internal reference to correct for differences in RNA extraction or reverse transcription efficiencies (42Zeng Y.

Protein Interaction Studies—Cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 0.5% Triton X-100, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem), and cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 47,000 × g for 20 min. For PKG-CRP4 interaction studies, cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation using the indicated antibodies on protein G-agarose beads, or were incubated with glutathione Sepharose beads for GST pulldown experiments. For SRF-CRP interaction studies, GST-tagged versions of CRP4 or CRP2/smLIM or GST alone were expressed in bacteria, immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads, and incubated with cell lysates of CV1 cells transfected with Myc-tagged SRF. Washed precipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with the indicated antibodies (34Casteel D.E. Zhuang S. Gudi T. Tang J. Vuica M. Desiderio S. Pilz R.B. J. Biol.

ChIP—Approximately 107 PAC1 cells were incubated in situ with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature to cross-link DNA and proteins; cells were washed and scraped into 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture. Nuclei were spun through a cushion of 12.5% glycerol in lysis buffer, resuspended, and sonicated in a chromatin precipitation buffer as described previously (43Chen Y. Zhuang S. Cassenaer S.

A 16,000 × g supernatant was preabsorbed with 25 μl of protein A/G-agarose, which had been blocked with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 1 mg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA. The supernatant was shaken gently for 16 h at 4 °C with 5 μg of either control immunoglobulin G or antibodies specific for SRF or CRP4; after centrifugation, 25 μl of blocked protein A/G-agarose was added for an additional 2 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed, eluted, and heated, and eluates were digested with proteinase K and purified with phenol/chloroform as described previously (43Chen Y. Zhuang S. Cassenaer S.

Semi-quantitative PCR was performed with varying amounts of input template using published primers flanking the two conserved CArG elements located at –62 and –112 of the SMA promoter, and located at –1.3 kb of the SM-MHC promoter, or a region of the β-globin promoter that is devoid of CArG sequences (21McDonald O.G. Wamhoff B.R. Hoofnagle M.H. Owens G.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 36-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Primer sequences and amplicon sizes are described in supplemental Table S2. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Nuclear extracts were prepared, incubated with 5′-end-labeled double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (oligodNT) probes, and analyzed by nondenaturing PAGE and autoradiography as described previously (42Zeng Y.

OligodNTs corresponding to –118 to –97 of the SMA promoter (5′-TGAGGTCCCTATATGGTTGTGT-3′ for upper strand, containing one CArG site) were synthesized, annealed, and used as the probe designated SMA CArG “B-site.” The CArG consensus oligodNT (5′-GGATGTCCATATTAGGACATCT-3′) and the CRE consensus oligodNT (5′-AGAGATTGCCTGACGTCAGAGAGCTAG-3′) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Promega Life Sciences, respectively. For supershift assays, nuclear extracts were preincubated with the indicated antibodies (42Zeng Y. Zhuang S. Gloddek J. Tseng C.C. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. J. Biol.

Data Presentation—All results presented in bar graphs represent the means ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate. Autoradiographs and Western blots demonstrate a representative experiment, performed at least three times with similar results. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 5 software (GraphPad, Carlsbad, CA). The Student t test was employed for pair-wise comparisons, and a one-way analysis of variance with Dunnettŉs post-test analysis for multiple comparisons to the control group; a p value of < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. siRNA-mediated Suppression of PKG Expression Reduces SM-specific Gene Expression without Affecting RhoA—The mechanism of PKG I-mediated induction of contractile protein expression in de-differentiated VSMCs has not been determined, and it is unknown whether PKG I expression in differentiated VSMCs is necessary to maintain high levels of SM-MHC expression. We used the pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell line PAC1, which maintains a differentiated phenotype with stable expression of PKG I and SM-MHC during passage in vitro (39Rothman A. Kulik T.J. Taubman M.B. Berk B.C. Smith W.J. Nadal-Ginard B. Circulation. 1992; 86: 1977-1986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cells express both PKG Iα and Iβ, with PKG Iα being the predominant isoform (42Zeng Y. Zhuang S. Gloddek J. Tseng C.C. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16951-16961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); PKG Iα and Iβ are derived from a single gene by differential splicing of the first exon (44Orstavik J. Natarajan V. Tasken K. Jahnsen T. Sandberg M. Genomics. 1997; 42: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Transfecting PAC1 cells with siRNA oligoribonucleotides targeted against a common C-terminal sequence of PKG I, or against the unique N terminus of PKG Iα, reduced PKG mRNA and protein levels by ∼70% or ∼50%, respectively (Fig. 1A; PKG I expression was compared with that in cells transfected with a cont"
https://openalex.org/W2073362246,"Background Evolutionary theory predicts that organisms should evolve the ability to produce high fitness phenotypes in the face of environmental disturbances (environmental robustness) or genetic mutations (genetic robustness). While several studies have uncovered mechanisms that lead to both environmental and genetic robustness, we have yet to understand why some components of the genome are more robust than others. According to evolutionary theory, environmental and genetic robustness will have different responses to selective forces. Selection on environmental robustness for a trait is expected to be strong and related to the fitness costs of altering that trait. In contrast to environmental robustness, selection on genetic robustness for a trait is expected to be largely independent of the fitness cost of altering the trait and instead should correlate with the standing genetic variation for the trait that can potentially be buffered. Several mechanisms that provide both environmental and genetic robustness have been described, and this correlation could be explained by direct selection on both forms of robustness (direct selection hypothesis), or through selection on environmental robustness and a correlated response in genetic robustness (congruence hypothesis). Methodology/Principal Findings Using both published and novel data on gene expression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we find that genetic robustness is correlated with environmental robustness across the yeast genome as predicted by the congruence hypothesis. However, we also show that environmental robustness, but not genetic robustness, is related to per-gene fitness effects. In contrast, genetic robustness is significantly correlated with network position, suggesting that genetic robustness has been under direct selection. Conclusions/Significance We observed a significant correlation between our measures of genetic and environmental robustness, in agreement with the congruence hypothesis. However, this correlation alone cannot explain the co-variance of genetic robustness with position in the protein interaction network. We therefore conclude that direct selection on robustness has played a role in the evolution of genetic robustness in the transcriptome."
https://openalex.org/W2052590739,"A gradient of Ran·GTP typically regulates traffic through the nuclear pore by modulating association of receptors with cargo. However, here we demonstrate that the yeast high mobility group box transcription factor Nhp6Ap enters the nucleus via a novel nuclear localization signal recognized by calcium calmodulin in a process that does not require Ran. Calmodulin is strictly required for the nondiffusional nuclear entry of Nhp6Ap. Calmodulin and DNA exhibit mutually exclusive binding to NHP6A, indicating that the directionality of Nhp6Ap nuclear accumulation may be driven by DNA-dependent dissociation of calmodulin. Our findings demonstrate that calmodulin can serve as a molecular switch triggering nuclear entry with subsequent dissociation of calmodulin binding upon interaction of cargo with chromatin. This pathway appears to be evolutionarily conserved; mammalian high mobility group box transcription factors often have two nuclear localization signals: one a classical Ran-dependent signal and a second that binds calmodulin. The finding that Nhp6Ap nuclear entry requires calmodulin but not Ran indicates that Nhp6Ap is a good model for studying this poorly understood but evolutionarily conserved calmodulin-dependent nuclear import pathway.

Proteins enter the nucleus through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). 2The abbreviations used are: NPC, nuclear pore complex; NLS, nuclear localization signal; HMGB, high mobility group box; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PK, pyruvate kinase; FG, phenylalanine-glycine. Those smaller than ∼40-50 kDa can traverse these pores by passive diffusion (1Macara I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 570-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 2Fahrenkrog B.

Cell. 2007; 129: 83-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Many larger proteins require soluble receptors, termed importins or karyopherins, which bind cargo in the cytoplasm, accompany it through the NPC, and release it in the nucleus. Most cargo proteins contain short nuclear localization signals (NLS), motifs recognized by the various receptor proteins. The small GTPase Ran drives the accumulation of cargo proteins in the nucleus by regulating the association and dissociation of NLS-containing proteins with importin/karyopherins. In the nucleus, most Ran is GTP-bound, whereas it is largely GDP-bound in the cytoplasm. Cargo proteins bind importins in the presence of Ran-GDP in the cytoplasm, and when an importin bound to cargo arrives in the nucleus, Ran-GTP induces cargo release (6Gorlich D. Pante N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Thus, the Ran·GTP gradient across the NPC drives the accumulation of most NLS-containing cargo in the nucleus. Some Ran-independent nuclear import pathways have been described, although most remain poorly understood (for review see Ref. 7Stochaj U. Rother K.L. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 579-589Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). One of the most intriguing of these involves the movement of calmodulin across the nuclear pore (8Pruschy M. Ju Y. Spitz L. Carafoli E. Goldfarb D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1527-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 9Sweitzer T.D. Hanover J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1999; 96: 6217-6222Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Calmodulin nuclear import was argued to be a facilitated mechanism that was blocked by the calmodulin antagonist peptide M13 and did not require cytosolic factors or an ATP-regenerating system (8Pruschy M. Ju Y. Spitz L. Carafoli E. Goldfarb D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1527-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 10Liao B. Paschal B.M. Luby-Phelps K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6217-6222Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the presence of calcium, calmodulin was also shown to be able to facilitate movement of large molecules into the nucleus. This latter property suggested a Ca2+-inducible nuclear import function for calmodulin that might operate during cellular activation. The calmodulin-mediated pathway was proposed to be redundant with the canonic Ran·GTP-driven nuclear entry pathway (9Sweitzer T.D. Hanover J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14574-14579Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The potential transport function of calmodulin has more recently been highlighted by studies on two architectural transcription factors involved in mammalian sex determination, SRY and SOX9 (11Argentaro A. Sim H. Kelly S. Preiss S. Clayton A. Jans D.A. Harley V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33839-33847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 12Sreenivasan A. Science. 2003; 302: 2050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Sim H. Rimmer K. Kelly S. Ludbrook L.M. Clayton A.H. Harley V.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1884-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Both are members of the large HMGB family of transcription factors, and each contains a calmodulin-binding NLS (14Harley V.R. Novartis Found. Symp. 2002; 244: 57-67PubMed Google Scholar). Defective nuclear import of SRY, the primary trigger for male sex determination, is observed in SRY mutants with altered calmodulin binding; this import defect leads to autosomal sex reversal (13Sim H. Rimmer K. Kelly S. Ludbrook L.M. Clayton A.H. Harley V.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1884-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Like SRY, SOX9 must be translocated into the nucleus of Sertoli cells within the developing gonad. Binding of calmodulin to SOX9 leads to a conformational change and is associated with nuclear import of the transcription factor. A missense mutation (A158T) in SOX9 was found in a patient with Campomelic dysplasia/autosomal sex reversal. This mutation altered the conformation of SOX9-calmodulin complexes, resulting in diminished nuclear transport and transactivation (11Argentaro A. Sim H. Kelly S. Preiss S. Clayton A. Jans D.A. Harley V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33839-33847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings are consistent with a role for calmodulin in the regulated nuclear import of SOX9 and SRY. Many HMGB proteins contain sequences that are similar to the calmodulin-binding motifs in SOX9 and SRY. However, understanding the role of calmodulin in HMGB protein nuclear import is complicated by the fact that many of these proteins, including SOX9 and SRY, also contain classical NLS motifs that can direct nuclear entry by importins/karyopherins. In this report, we have turned to an HMGB protein in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Nhp6Ap, and confirmed that it enters the nucleus in a Ran-independent fashion (15Yen Y.M. Roberts P.M. Johnson R.C. Traffic. 2001; 2: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We further demonstrate that it contains a novel, calmodulin-binding NLS that can direct the nuclear entry of a large cargo protein too big to enter the nucleus by passive diffusion. This import is strongly inhibited by specific calmodulin antagonists or by temperature-sensitive mutations in calmodulin, which do not affect Ran-dependent nuclear import. Binding of Nhp6Ap to calmodulin and DNA are mutually exclusive, suggesting that DNA binding drives the accumulation of Nhp6Ap in the nucleus. Our data support a model in which Ca+2-calmodulin associates with Nhp6Ap in the cytoplasm, promoting assembly of a complex that facilitates its passage through nuclear pores. Ca+2-calmodulin dissociates from Nhp6Ap upon binding to DNA in the nucleus. This may represent a general paradigm for how calmodulin triggers the nuclear entry of HMGB transcription factors that are critical for cellular differentiation and sex determination.

IPabs version 3.6.3 software was used for image acquisition and analysis. Confocal images for fluorescence loss in photobleaching were captured with a Zeiss LSM 510 NLO laser scanning inverted microscope using a Plan-Neofluor 100×/1.3 oil objective with argon laser line 488 nm (optical slices less than 4.2 μm). LSM 510 software version 3.2 was used for image acquisition and analysis. Magnification, laser power, and detector gains were identical across samples. The images were captured at 2-s intervals, and the cells were photobleached every 4 s. Calmodulin Binding Assay—The GST-Nhp6Ap fusions were expressed in Escherichia coli, bound to glutathione-agarose, and eluted with 10 mm glutathione. After purification, the fusion proteins were incubated in a buffer containing 1 m NaCl for 10 min at room temperature to remove fragments of DNA bound to Nhp6Ap. The fusions were dialyzed overnight against 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2. For the calmodulin binding assay, ∼100 μg of each fusion protein was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with glutathione-agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) that had been equilibrated with binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and either 2 mm CaCl2 or 10 mm EGTA). The agarose beads were then washed three times with binding buffer, and 1 mg of biotinylated bovine brain calmodulin (Calbiochem) was added. After incubation for 1 h at 4°C, the agarose was washed three times with binding buffer, and the fusion proteins were eluted with 10 mm glutathione. Approximately 10% of the elution was separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gels were either stained with Coomassie to visualize the fusion proteins or blotted to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blotting using IRDye 800CW labeled streptavidin and the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciences). For DNA competition experiments, the GST fusion proteins were incubated with glutathionine-agarose and biotinylated bovine brain calmodulin and washed as above. About 5 μg of plasmid DNA was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The fusion proteins were then eluted and processed as above. To determine whether Ophiobolin A treatment prevents calmodulin binding to Nhp6Ap, 1 mg of biotinylated bovine brain calmodulin was incubated for 1 h in 250 μl of binding buffer with 2 mm CaCl2 and 50 μm Ophiobolin A (froma5mm stock in methanol). In a control reaction, the equivalent amount of calmodulin was incubated with the same amount of binding buffer and methanol. The treated and mock treated calmodulin were used in a calmodulin binding assay with GST-Nhp6Ap as described above. Immunoblotting—Immunoblots with anti-GFP antibody (Roche Applied Science) were performed with the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciences). Screen for Mutations in Nhp6Ap That Block Nuclear Import—To mutagenize NHP6A, error-prone PCR was performed with GeneMorph II random mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The product of this reaction was used to transform the strain SEY6210 together with plasmid pRJ6006 that had been cut with NdeI and XmaI. Transformants were selected on medium that lacked tryptophan. The transformants were visually screened for those in which the fusion protein was excluded from the nucleus. Identification of the Nhp6Ap NLS—Some proteins less than ∼40-50 kDa can enter the nucleus efficiently by simple diffusion, unaided by karyopherins or other proteins (1Macara I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 570-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 4Naim B. Brumfeld V. Kapon R. Kiss V. Nevo R. Reich Z. J. Biol.

Cell. 2007; 129: 83-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Because the yeast HMGB transcription factor Nhp6Ap is 10.8 kDa, it might diffuse into the nucleus. However, like many small nuclear proteins, it could be actively transported into the nucleus. When Nhp6Ap is fused to pyruvate kinase (PK) and GFP, the resulting protein (Nhp6A-PK-GFP) is too large (92 kDa) to enter the nucleus efficiently by diffusion but is still highly concentrated there (Fig. 1A and Ref. 15Yen Y.M. Roberts P.M. Johnson R.C. Traffic. 2001; 2: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In contrast, a PK-GFP fusion lacking Nhp6A is largely excluded from the nucleus (Fig. 1B). Accumulation of Nhp6A-PK-GFP in the nucleus does not require high affinity DNA binding. A mutant form of the Nhp6Ap fusion, in which two residues important for DNA binding were mutated, Nhp6A-(R23A,R36A)-PK-GFP, still concentrates in the nucleus, although not to the same extent as a fusion with native Nhp6Ap (Fig. 1C). We confirmed this by quantitation of the ratio of the fluorescence intensity in the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 1G). Thus, Nhp6Ap enters the nucleus in a process that is nondiffusional and does not require DNA binding. Previous work has shown that nuclear import of the Nhp6A-PK-GFP fusion does not require Gsp1p (the yeast Ran homolog) or any of the known karyopherins (15Yen Y.M. Roberts P.M. Johnson R.C. Traffic. 2001; 2: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To investigate this unusual nuclear import pathway, we wanted to identify which residues in Nhp6Ap contain an NLS. Fusions containing only the first 36 (Fig. 1D) or 54 (Fig. 1E) residues of Nhp6Ap entered the nucleus in a manner indistinguishable from the DNA-binding mutant Nhp6A-(R23A,R36A)-PK-GFP. However, a fusion missing the first 36 residues of Nhp6Ap (Nhp6A-(37-93)-PK-GFP, Fig. 1F) was excluded from the nucleus like the PK-GFP fusion (Fig. 1, B and G). We ruled out that the localization of the fusions was the result of degradation, because the fusions stay largely intact (Fig. 1H). Taken together, these findings indicate that the first 36 residues of Nhp6Ap contain an NLS capable of directing large, nondiffusible proteins to the nucleus. Nuclear Entry via the Nhp6Ap NLS Does Not Require Ran (Gsp1p)—Having localized the NLS of Nhp6Ap, we verified that the nuclear import of Nhp6A-(1-36)-PK-GFP, like Nhp6A-PK-GFP (15Yen Y.M. Roberts P.M. Johnson R.C. Traffic. 2001; 2: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), does not require Gsp1p (the yeast Ran homolog). A plasmid encoding an inducible dominant negative Gsp1p (G21V) mutant was introduced into cells expressing Nhp6A-(1-36)-PK-GFP. Induction of this Gsp1p mutant did not affect the nuclear localization of Nhp6A-(1-36)-PK-GFP (Fig. 2A). It also did not interfere with import of Nhp6A-PK-GFP (15Yen Y.M. Roberts P.M. Johnson R.C. Traffic. 2001; 2: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). 3J. A. Hanover, D. C. Love, N. DeAngelis, M. E. O'Kane, R. Lima-Miranda, T. Schulz, Y.-M. Yen, R. C. Johnson, and W. A. Prinz, unpublished results. As a control, we determined the ability of Gsp1p (G21V) to inhibit the nuclear import of histone H2B fused to GFP (H2B-GFP). Both H2B-GFP and the dominant negative Ran were placed under the inducible GAL1 promoters. When both were induced simultaneously, the nuclear import of H2B-GFP was substantially inhibited. As a control, we induced wild-type Gsp1p instead of Gsp1p (G21V). We quantified the effect of Gsp1p (G21V) induction on H2B-GFP nuclear localization and found that the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio changed from about 13:1 to 3:1. However, the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio of Nhp6A-(1-36)-PK-GFP was not significantly affected by Gsp1p (G21V) under these conditions. To verify that Nhp6Ap nuclear import does not require Ran/Gsp1p, we determined the ability of Nhp6A-PK-GFP to enter the nucleus in cells with conditional defects in Gsp1p or a protein needed for Gsp1p function. Cells containing gsp1-2 are not viable at nonpermissive temperature (37 °C) and have severe defects in Ran-dependent nuclear import (16Wong D.H. Corbett A.H. Kent H.M. Stewart M. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3755-3767Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We induced expression of Nhp6A-PK-GFP in gsp1-2 cells at the same time that they were shifted to 37 °C. The ratio of Nhp6A-PK-GFP in the nucleus and cytoplasm was not affected (Fig. 2B). In contrast, gsp1-2 severely affected nuclear accumulation of a fusion protein containing the Ran-dependent NLS from SV40 T antigen (SV40-NLS-GFP); the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of SV40-NLS-GFP dropped significantly. Thus, gsp1-2, like the dominant negative Gsp1p (G21V), does not affect the nuclear import of Nhp6A-PK-GFP. Nuclear localization factor 2 (Ntf2p) transports RanGDP into the nucleus and is required for Ran function (16Wong D.H. Corbett A.H. Kent H.M. Stewart M. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3755-3767Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 17Paschal B.M. Fritze C. Guan T. Gerace L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21534-21539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cells containing the temperature-sensitive ntf2-1 allele are not viable at elevated temperatures and have defects in nuclear import (16Wong D.H. Corbett A.H. Kent H.M. Stewart M. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3755-3767Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Like gsp1-2, ntf2-1 reduces the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of SV40-NLS-GFP at nonpermissive temperature (Fig. 2C). However, ntf2-1 had no affect on the nuclear import of Nhp6A-PK-GFP. Taken together, these results show that Nhp6Ap utilizes a Ran-independent nuclear entry mechanism dependent upon the first 36 residues of Nhp6Ap. Nhp6Ap Nuclear Import Requires NPC Phenylalanine-Glycine (FG) Repeats—In addition to Ran, most proteins imported into the nucleus also require importins/karyopherins, proteins that facilitate the transfer of NLS-containing proteins across the nuclear pore. These nuclear transport receptors interact with the FG repeats found in numerous NPC proteins, although precisely how these interactions promote transfer across the pore is not understood. Previous work has shown that Nhp6Ap transport into the nucleus is not slowed in mutants lacking any of the known yeast karyopherins (15Yen Y.M. Roberts P.M. Johnson R.C. Traffic. 2001; 2: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, either a number of these proteins may be able to redundantly import Nhp6Ap, or alternatively, novel proteins may be needed. To determine whether FG-interacting proteins are needed for Nhp6Ap import, we assessed Nhp6Ap localization in mutants lacking some FG repeats (ΔFG strains). In a systematic study, Wente and co-workers (18Strawn L.A. Shen T. Shulga N. Goldfarb D.S. Wente S.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) found that large portions of the FG repeats in NPC proteins could be deleted without affecting cell viability. However, many of these ΔFG strains have significant defects in the nuclear import of cargo with some classes of NLS. We examined Nhp6A-PK-GFP import in four ΔFG strains and found it was significantly slowed in all of them; one of these is shown in Fig. 3 (the other ΔFG strains used are listed in Table 1). Thus, one or more FG repeat-interacting proteins are likely needed for Nhp6A-PK-GFP import. We also examined the localization of Nhp6A-GFP in the ΔFG strains. Because this fusion protein is only 38 kDa, less than the diffusion limit of the nuclear pore, we expected that the nuclear pore mutants might not affect its localization. Surprisingly, a substantial amount of Nhp6A-GFP accumulates the cytoplasm of the ΔFG strains (Fig. 3). Quantitation of a number of cells revealed that although the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio of Nhp6A-GFP was about 8:1 in wild-type cells, it fell to ∼2:1 in the ΔFG strain. As a control, we determined the localization of newly synthesized H2B-GFP. The nuclear import of this fusion, which is a similar size to Nhp6A-GFP and also binds DNA with high affinity, was not affected in ΔFG strains (Fig. 3, right panels, and Ref. 18Strawn L.A. Shen T. Shulga N. Goldfarb D.S. Wente S.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Thus, despite being smaller than the diffusion limit of the nuclear pore, Nhp6A-GFP import likely requires an FG domain-interacting protein. This finding suggests that Nhp6A-GFP forms a complex in the cytoplasm that may be too large to diffuse rapidly into the nucleus but that interacts with one or more proteins, facilitating its movement through the nuclear pore. Nhp6A-PK-GFP Nuclear Import Requires Calmodulin—Nhp6Ap exhibits substantial homology to mammalian SRY and SOX9, two HMGB proteins that interact with calmodulin (11Argentaro A. Sim H. Kelly S. Preiss S. Clayton A. Jans D.A. Harley V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33839-33847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 19Harley V.R. Layfield S. Mitchell C.L. Forwood J.K. John A.P. Briggs L.J. McDowall S.G. Jans D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7045-7050Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This similarity prompted us to ask whether calmodulin might play a role in the nuclear import of Nhp6Ap in yeast. To examine the role of calmodulin in Nhp6Ap import, we used the specific calmodulin antagonist Ophiobolin A, which covalently modifies a critical lysine residue in calmodulin (20Kong Au T. Chow Leung P. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 21Au T.K. Chick W.S. Leung P.C. Life Sci. 2000; 67: 733-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 22Au T.K. S. H. C. W. Leung P.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Expression of an Nhp6A-PK-GFP fusion was induced in cells at the same time that Ophiobolin A was added to the growth medium. After 1 h, most of the newly synthesized Nhp6A-PK-GFP remained in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4A). To rule out nonspecific toxic effects of the inhibitor, the same experiment was done using the cell constitutively expressing SV40-NLS-GFP, which contains a classical Ran-dependent NLS. As expected, Ophiobolin A had no affect on the nuclear accumulation of this fusion. We confirmed that calmodulin is required for Nhp6Ap nuclear import by measuring import in cells with temperature-sensitive defects in calmodulin. Yeast expresses a single calmodulin (Cmd1p), which is essential for viability. We induced expression of Nhp6A-PK-GFP in cmd1-1 cells at the same time that they were shifted to nonpermissive temperature. As shown in Fig. 4B, Nhp6A-PK-GFP nuclear import was dramatically reduced in cmd1-1 cells compared with a wild-type CMD1 strain. In contrast, the accumulation of SV40-NLS-GFP in the nucleus was not affected by cmd1-1. The dramatic effect of cmd1-1 and Ophiobolin A on the localization of Nhp6A-PK-GFP could be explained if calmodulin were required for DNA binding by Nhp6Ap in vivo. This is a possibility because a DNA-binding mutant of Nhp6Ap is much less enriched in the nucleus than unaltered Nhp6Ap, which binds DNA with high affinity (Fig. 1 and Ref. 15Yen Y.M. Roberts P.M. Johnson R.C. Traffic. 2001; 2: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To rule this out, we determined the effect of cmd1 mutants on the nuclear localization of Nhp6A-(1-36)-PK-GFP, which like the DNA-binding mutant of Nhp6Ap is enriched in the nucleus but is not exclusively nuclear. When cmd1-1 and cmd1-7 cells expressing Nhp6A-(1-36)-PK-GFP were shifted from 30 to 37 °C (nonpermissive temperature), this fusion was no longer enriched in the nucleus; the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio shifts from slightly more than 2:1 to less than 1:1 (Fig. 4C). Calmodulin Inhibition Does Not Cause Nhp6Ap Export—These findings suggest that calmodulin is required for the nuclear entry of Nhp6A-PK-GFP. However, an alternative explanation could be that inhibiting calmodulin promotes the nuclear export of Nhp6Ap rather than preventing import. To address this possibility, we measured the rate at which GFP fusions exit the nucleus using fluorescence loss in photobleaching, shown in Fig. 5. In these experiments, a small portion of the cytoplasm (green boxes) of cells expressing GFP fusions was subjected to repeated rounds of photobleaching, and we determined the rates at which the fluorescent signals in the nucleus (red boxes) or an unbleached portion of the cytoplasm (blue boxes) were depleted. In cells expressing SV40-NLS-GFP, both the cytoplasmic and nuclear pools of the fusion protein were rapidly bleached (Fig. 5A). This was not unexpected, because the size of this fusion (42.8 kDa) is below the diffusion limit of the nucleus, and it can probably rapidly diffuse out of the nucleus. In cells expressing Nhp6A-PK-GFP or H2B-GFP, there was no fluorescence loss in the nucleus even after hundreds of seconds (data not shown), probably because both Nhp6Ap and H2B bind DNA with very high affinity. Therefore, we determined the rate at which Nhp6A fusions that cannot bind DNA exit the nucleus. In cells expressing Nhp6A-(1-54)-PK-GFP, the cytoplasmic pool bleaches rapidly (Fig. 5B). In contrast, the nuclear pool of the fusion is partially reduced but then remains unchanged for the remainder of the experiment. This small decrease could represent a pool of the fusion that can be exported from the nucleus. However, it is more likely that the large optical slices used in this experiment capture some of the cytosolic pool surrounding the nucleus. Thus, the Nhp6A-(1-54)-PK-GFP fusion does not rapidly leave the nucleus. Similar results were obtained with NHP6A-(R23A,R36A)-PK-GFP, which is impaired for DNA binding (data not shown). If inhibiting calmodulin increased the rate at which Nhp6A-(1-54)-PK-GFP exits the nucleus, treating cells with Ophiobolin A should increase the rate at which the nuclear pool of this fusion becomes depleted. However, Ophiobolin A did not significantly affect this rate (Fig. 5C). Thus, calmodulin is required for efficient import of Nhp6Ap fusion into the nucleus but not nuclear export. Mutations in Nhp6Ap That Block Its Nuclear Import—To learn more about how Nhp6Ap is imported into the nucleus, we screened for mutations in Nhp6Ap that would prevent the nuclear import of an Nhp6A-PK-GFP fusion. The NHP6A portion of an Nhp6A-PK-GFP fusion was mutated by error-prone PCR and gap repair by homologous recombination in cells (see “Experimental Procedures”). Approximately 5000 transformants were visually screened, and we isolated four independent mutants in which the fusion was excluded from the nucleus. DNA sequencing revealed that three of the mutant plasmids encode Nhp6A with an E34D mutation and the other a Y28C mutation (Fig. 6A). Remarkably, both mutations are within the first 36 residues of Nhp6Ap, consistent with the idea that these residues are within an NLS. Nhp6A-PK-GFP fusions containing these mutations were excluded from the nucleus as efficiently as the PK-GFP fusion (Fig. 6B; compare with Fig. 1, A and B), suggesting that they block nuclear import of the fusions. The locations of these residues in the structure of Nhp6Ap are shown in Fig. 6C. To rule out that the mutations in Nhp6Ap caused it to be proteolytically removed from the PK-GFP portion of the fusions in cells, we confirmed that the fusions stay largely intact by immunoblotting with anti-GFP antibodies (Fig. 6D). Therefore, these mutations in Nhp6Ap block the nuclear import of Nhp6Ap-PK-GFP fusions. Nhp6Ap Nuclear Entry Requires Direct Calmodulin Binding to Its NLS—We determined whether Nhp6Ap interacts with calmodulin directly. GST fusions to various Nhp6Ap derivatives were bound to glutathione-agarose, and their ability to bind with biotinylated bovine brain calmodulin was evaluated (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 7A, Nhp6Ap bound to calmodulin in a calcium-dependent manner. Similar binding was observed with other fusions containing the Nhp6Ap NLS including residues 1-36, residues 1-54, and the DNA-binding mutant R23A,R36A. In contrast, the fusion containing residues 37-93 of Nhp6Ap, which lacks the calmodulin-dependent NLS, exhibited little detectable calmodulin binding. In addition, the Nhp6A-GST fusions with mutations that blocks nuclear import (E34D or Y28C) also did not bind calmodulin. Taken together, our findings indicate that the Nhp6Ap NLS directly binds calmodulin and that this binding of Nhp6Ap is strictly required for its nuclear entry. In every case, Nhp6Ap fusions that do not interact with calmodulin are also not imported into the nucleus. Because treating cells with Ophiobolin A blocked the nuclear entry of Nhp6Ap, we wondered whether treating calmodulin with this drug in vitro would prevent it from binding Nhp6Ap. After incubating biotinylated bovine brain calmodulin with Ophiobolin A, it was no longer able to bind Nhp6Ap (Fig. 7B). Thus, Ophiobolin A likely blocks the nuclear import of Nhp6Ap in cells by preventing calmodulin from binding to Nhp6Ap. Because Nhp6Ap tightly binds DNA after it enters the nucleus, we wondered whether it could bind DNA and calmodulin simultaneously. After allowing biotinylated bovine brain calmodulin to bind the GST-Nhp6Ap fusion, we added plasmid DNA and found that the fusion no longer bound calmodulin (Fig. 7C). In contrast, Nhp6A-R23A,R36A, which is defective for DNA binding, was still able to bind calmodulin in the presence of DNA. Thus, calmodulin binding and DNA binding by Nhp6Ap are mutually exclusive. After entering the nucleus, calmodulin is likely displaced from Nhp6Ap when the transcription factor binds DNA. These findings are consistent with the NMR solution structure of Nhp6Ap bound to DNA (Fig. 6C), which shows the calmodulin-binding segment 1-36 high-lighted in gold. This segment makes numerous contacts with the major groove of B-DNA (gray). Our findings suggest that a novel, Ran-independent nuclear import pathway traffics Nhp6Ap into the nucleus. This pathway requires calmodulin, which directly binds the Nhp6Ap NLS; mutations in Nhp6Ap that block nuclear entry ablate calmodulin binding. In contrast, NLS motifs in Ran-dependent substrates are recognized by importins/karyopherins. Thus, calmodulin-dependent nuclear import appears to be totally distinct from the canonic pathway involving nucleotide-bound forms of Ran and importins. The finding that Nhp6Ap import dramatically slows in ΔFG strains suggests that an unidentified FG-interacting protein may also be required for Nhp6Ap nuclear entry. How calmodulin binds Nhp6Ap or other HMGB proteins remains to be determined. The two Nhp6Ap residues that we found were required for calmodulin-binding are not conserved in mammalian HMGB proteins, suggesting that a structure rather than a specific sequence may be recognized by calmodulin. It is possible that calmodulin binds Nhp6Ap in manner distinct from the standard wrap-around mode, because it seems unlikely that all cytosolic proteins that interact with calmodulin are imported into the nucleus. Indeed, recent evidence suggests that calmodulin can interact with some transcription factors in an unusual dimer conformation (23Larsson G. Schleucher J. Onions J. Hermann S. Grundstrom T. Wijmenga S.S. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 169-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Once bound, the complex of calmodulin and Nhp6Ap probably recruits additional proteins needed to facilitate its movement across the nuclear pore. This larger complex would enter the nucleus and upon interaction with DNA, calmodulin would dissociate, thus providing directionality to the transport pathway. Why Nhp6A would use this novel nuclear import pathway is not yet known. Because calmodulin binding to the Nhp6Ap NLS is calcium-dependent, calcium signaling could regulate Nhp6Ap nuclear entry. However, Nhp6Ap seems to be constitutively in the nucleus, and there is no evidence that Nhp6Ap cycles between the nucleus and cytoplasm. 3J. A. Hanover, D. C. Love, N. DeAngelis, M. E. O'Kane, R. Lima-Miranda, T. Schulz, Y.-M. Yen, R. C. Johnson, and W. A. Prinz, unpublished results. It is also possible that calmodulin, together with other unknown proteins, could be required for proper loading of Nhp6Ap onto chromatin and so must accompany Nhp6Ap into the nucleus. The yeast calmodulin-dependent import pathway utilized by Nhp6Ap is similar to a pathway we previously described in permeabilized mammalian cells (9Sweitzer T.D. Hanover J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14574-14579Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In this study, calmodulin was sufficient to mediate the import of large proteins bearing a number of basic peptides. This pathway was Ran-independent and was suggested to be an alternative import pathway important during cell activation (9Sweitzer T.D. Hanover J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14574-14579Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It was not clear from our previous study what types of nuclear proteins might be transported in a calmodulin-dependent fashion. More recently, calmodulin has been implicated in the nuclear transport of the HMGB proteins SOX9 (11Argentaro A. Sim H. Kelly S. Preiss S. Clayton A. Jans D.A. Harley V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33839-33847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and SRY (19Harley V.R. Layfield S. Mitchell C.L. Forwood J.K. John A.P. Briggs L.J. McDowall S.G. Jans D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7045-7050Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These architectural transcription factors play key roles in numerous cellular differentiation pathways including sex determination. These proteins contain a calmodulin-binding site in addition to sequences recognized by importin β. A defect in calmodulin-dependent import was shown to be the underlying cause of at least one form of human sex reversal, a syndrome called Campomelic dysplasia/autosomal sex reversal (11Argentaro A. Sim H. Kelly S. Preiss S. Clayton A. Jans D.A. Harley V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33839-33847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 12Sreenivasan A. Science. 2003; 302: 2050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A similar autosomal sex reversal phenotype occurs when three insulin-related receptors are ablated in mice, suggesting that intracellular signaling cascades may impact the normal functions of SRY and SOX9 (24Koopman P. Nature. 2003; 426: 241Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 25Nef S. Verma-Kurvari S. Merenmies J. Vassalli J.D. Efstratiadis A. Accili D. Parada L.F. Nature. 2003; 426: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Based on sequence similarities, it is likely that the entire family of mammalian HMGB transcription factors use calmodulin as a means of regulating their nuclear import. In addition, the family of transcription factors using this pathway may extend to the helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors that also bind to calmodulin (23Larsson G. Schleucher J. Onions J. Hermann S. Grundstrom T. Wijmenga S.S. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 169-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 26Corneliussen B. Holm M. Waltersson Y. Onions J. Hallberg B. Thornell A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 23930-23937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The entry of nuclear proteins by calmodulin, although functionally redundant with the canonic Ran-dependent pathway, is subject to independent regulation by intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. Perhaps because of this redundancy, abnormalities in calmodulin-dependent import or Ran-dependent import emerge as defects in patients with autosomal sex reversal. These sex reversal syndromes represent the first direct examples of a defect in a nuclear import pathways leading to human disease. The identification of this calmodulin-dependent, Ran-independent pathway for the nuclear import of yeast Nhp6Ap provides a unique model for studying this evolutionarily conserved nuclear import pathway."

Such a process involves VSMC accumulation even in the presence of oxidized low density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL). In the arch of the aorta, we find that integrin β3 is higher than in descending arteries. In the advanced atherosclerosis lesion, we found an inverse correlation between the level of integrin β3 and apoptosis (deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling-positive). We also found an increase in integrin αVβ3 (but not integrin β1) expression in VSMC that are subjected to cyclic stretch. VSMC subjected to stretch as well as VSMC with forced expression of αVβ3 were demonstrated to be resistant to Ox-LDL-induced cytoskeleton disruption and apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic effect of stretch was abolished by treatment of VSMC with small interfering RNA against integrin β3 as well as VSMC isolated from integrin β3 knock-out mice. Disruption of the cytoskeleton abolished the protective effect of stretch or αVβ3 overexpression on Ox-LDL-induced activation of Bax and apoptosis. We also demonstrated that stretch-mediated protection of Ox-LDL-induced apoptosis involved stabilization of PINCH-1; Ox-LDL decreased the level of PINCH-1, but the application of mechanical stretch or overexpression of either integrin β1 or integrin β3 prevented its down-regulation. In the arteries of integrin β3 null mice, there were lower levels of PINCH-1 and ILK-1. Moreover, deletion of integrin β3 in VSMC abolished the stretch protective effect on PINCH-1. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of PINCH-1 disrupted the cytoskeleton and caused apoptosis of VSMC. These findings provided experimental evidence that mechanical stretch acted as a survival factor in the arches of aortas. Furthermore, mechanical stretch prevented VSMC from apoptosis via a mechanism that involves αVβ3 integrin expression, stabilization of PINCH-1, and remodeling of the cytoskeleton.

The atherosclerotic lesion is characterized by accumulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), 2The abbreviations used are: VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cells; LDL, low density lipoprotein; Ox-LDL, oxidized LDL; TUNEL, deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling; siRNA, small interfering RNA; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. foam cells, and matrix protein and lipids in the intima (1Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1986; 314: 488-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (4022) Google Scholar). Atherosclerotic lesions occur preponderantly at arterial bifurcations and curvatures, suggesting a role for disturbed hemodynamic forces that produce a lower wall shear stress with increased mechanical stretch (2Shaw A. Xu Q. Curr. Vasc. Pharmacol. 2003; 1: 41-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 3VanderLaan P.A. Reardon C.A. Getz G.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Disturbed hemodynamic forces stimulated inflammatory responses in the atherosclerosis-prone arch of aorta (1Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1986; 314: 488-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (4022) Google Scholar, 4Chien S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1976; 275: 10-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) that led to a triggering recruitment of activated monocytes. Abnormal hemodynamics also increased the expression of the receptor for oxidized low density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) in endothelial cells (5Murase T. Kume N. Korenaga R. Ando J. Sawamura T. Masaki T. Kita T. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The increase in these receptors leads to accumulation of Ox-LDL (6Kockx M.M. De Meyer G.R.Y. Muhring J. Jacob W. Bult H. Herman A.G. Circulation. 1998; 97: 2307-2315Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 7Okura Y. Brink M. Itabe H. Scheidegger K.J. Kalangos A. Delafontaine P. Circulation. 2000; 102: 2680-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In addition, LDL trapped in the extracellular matrix of the vessel wall is oxidatively modified by monocytes in the neointima (6Kockx M.M. De Meyer G.R.Y. Muhring J. Jacob W. Bult H. Herman A.G. Circulation. 1998; 97: 2307-2315Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 7Okura Y. Brink M. Itabe H. Scheidegger K.J. Kalangos A. Delafontaine P. Circulation. 2000; 102: 2680-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Accumulation of Ox-LDL stimulates apoptosis, which should decrease the accumulation of VSMC. The pathway for Ox-LDL-induced apoptosis includes activation of a complex cascade of kinases, changes in cytoskeletons, changes in expression of Bcl-2 family genes, and activation of death effector sphingomyelinase and caspases; the pathway for Ox-LDL-induced apoptosis also included the activation of nuclear transcription factor-κB and other proinflammatory transcription factors (8Napoli C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 1010: 698-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 9Salvayre R. Auge N. Benoist H. Negre-Salvayre A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In advanced atherosclerotic lesions, there was a significant correlation between Ox-LDL and VSMC apoptosis, but in the early atherosclerotic lesion, apoptotic cell death was almost absent (6Kockx M.M. De Meyer G.R.Y. Muhring J. Jacob W. Bult H. Herman A.G. Circulation. 1998; 97: 2307-2315Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 7Okura Y. Brink M. Itabe H. Scheidegger K.J. Kalangos A. Delafontaine P. Circulation. 2000; 102: 2680-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). One possible explanation is that anti-apoptotic mechanisms are present in early atherosclerotic lesion. In the current study, we investigated how VSMC survive in the presence of Ox-LDL at this early stage. We uncovered a novel signaling mechanism by which expression of integrin αVβ3 integrin suppresses Ox-LDL-induced apoptosis. The novel pathway involves an integrin αVβ3-dependent stabilization of PINCH-1, a survival protein that is linked with integrin and the cytoskeleton (10Wu C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4485-4489PubMed Google Scholar, 11Xu Z. Fukuda T. Li Y. Zha X. Qin J. Wu C. J. Biol.

We also established that stabilization of PINCH-1 prevented disruption of the cytoskeleton and ultimately suppressed the activation of Bax. Animals—ApoE−/- mice (C57Bl/6J background, 3 months old) were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). The IACUC of Baylor College of Medicine approved our animal studies. Twelve ApoE−/- male mice were randomly fed a normal chow up to 45 weeks. The animals were kept under standardized conditions with free access to water and chow. Serum from tail vein blood was obtained by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C, and serum cholesterol was measured. Materials—Antibodies against activated Bax (6A7) and PINCH-1 were from Sigma-Aldrich. Antibodies against α-tubulin, total Bax, and β3 integrin and its blocking peptide were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against αVβ3 (LM609), and αV antibodies were from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Rabbit anti-α-smooth muscle actin was from Spring Bioscience (Fremont, CA). Cytochalasin D and nocodazole were from Calbiochem. The cytoskeleton labeling antibodies (phalloidin-FITC-conjugated antibody), monoclonal mouse anti-α-tubulin antibody, and fluorescent secondary antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probe Inc. (Eugene, OR). Elastomer-bottomed plates were purchased from Flexcell International (McKeesport, PA). Plasmids and Transfection—The pBabe-β3 retroviral plasmid was a gift of Dr. J. Marshal (The Institute of Cancer and Cancer Research UK Clinical Centre, London, UK) (13Pereira J.J. Meyer T. Docherty S.E. Reid H.H. Marshall J. Thompson E.W. Rossjohn J. Price J.T. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and the plasmid pZEOSV2-β1 was a gift of Dr. R. Zent (Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN). PINCH-1 expression plasmid was obtained from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL). The retroviruses were generated using producer cells. These retroviruses were used to infect VSMC in the presence of 5 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich). Infected cells were selected in 3 μg/ml puromycin for integrin β3 or 200 μg/ml zeomycin for integrin β1 expressing cells (Invitrogen). The expressions of integrin β3 or β1 in VSMC/β3, VSMC/β1, or VSMC mock-transfected controls (wild type VSMC) were measured by Western blot. The integrin β3 promoter luciferase reporter p-575/+21-β3-Luc was kindly provided by Dr. P. Bray (Thomas Jefferson University Hospital). siRNA Preparation and Transfection—Rat PINCH-1 siRNAs (set 1, AAGGTGACGTGGTCTCTGCCC, and set 2, AAATACATCTGCCAGAAATGC) corresponding to the coding sequence were synthesized by Dharmacon (Chicago, IL). The integrin β3 siRNA Smart Pool was purchased from Dharmacon, Inc. VSMC were transfected with these siRNAs or plasmid using Nucleofector (AMAXA, program U-23) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The siRNA against luciferase (CTGACGCGGAATACTTCGA) was used as a control. Cell Culture and Cyclic Stretch—VSMC from aortas of mouse (both wild type and integrin β3 knock-out mice were obtained by digestion of freshly isolated aortae in collagenase and elastase) and kept in a humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C. For stretch experiments, VSMC were plated on silicone elastomer-bottomed and collagen-coated plates. Those cells that achieved 90% confluence were subjected to cyclic stretch (60 cycles/min, 15% elongation) with the computer-controlled mechanical strain unit (Flexcell 4000) (14Cheng J. Du J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2007; Google Scholar). Immunostaining—Immunofluorescence staining was used to determine F-actin and microtubule organization in VSMC. Briefly, VSMC were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were permeabilized using a PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 solution and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. The fixed cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 20 min with FITC-conjugated phalloidin. For microtubulin staining, the cells were incubated with mouse monoclonal, anti-α-tubulin antibody for 20 min. After washing three times, the cells were stained with an anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 568 dye. The images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM-510 inverted laser scanning confocal microscope with a Zeiss Plan Apochromat 63 ×, 1.4 N.A. objective lens. Lipoprotein and Ox-LDL Preparation—LDL (density, 1.019–1.063 g/ml) was separated from freshly drawn, normal human plasma as described (15Cheng J. Cui R. Chen C.-H. Du J. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 2085-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, native LDL was isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation at 290,000 × g for 4 h in a NaBr gradient. After purification, LDL was oxidized by incubating with Cu2+ (5 μmol/liter CuSO4, 4 h at 37 °C) as described (15Cheng J. Cui R. Chen C.-H. Du J. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 2085-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The extent of modification was assessed by measuring thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and by determining its electrophoretic mobility on agarose gels in barbital buffer at pH 8.6. Ox-LDL that was used exhibited a thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance value of 16.3–25.4 nmol/mg of protein, whereas the unoxidized LDL showed no detectable thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances. To validate the observations made with copper-oxidized LDL, we performed additional experiments using L5, an electronegative and minimally oxidized LDL that circulates in patients with hypercholesterolemia. L1, the nonelectronegative and nonoxidized subfraction, was used as a control (15Cheng J. Cui R. Chen C.-H. Du J. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 2085-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). TUNEL Assay—The TUNEL assay was performed with a Promega (Madison, WI) kit. VSMC were cultured on glass coverslips in a 12-well plate at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well. After Ox-LDL treatment, VSMC were washed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were then incubated for 2 min on ice in a permeabilization solution (0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate). The slides were rinsed with PBS before the rTdT incubation mixture was added. After incubation for 60 min at 37 °C, the slides were rinsed three times with 2× SSC, and the nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole. The numbers of TUNEL-positive cells were counted in five randomly chosen fields (magnification, ×200), and the mean and S.E. were calculated. Determination of Bax Conformational Change—VSMC were serum-starved and incubated with Ox-LDL for 6 h in the presence or absence of drugs that induce cytoskeletal damage (cytochalasin D, 2 μm or nocodazole, 10 nm). The cells were lysed in CHAPS lysis buffer consisting of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% CHAPS, and 1 μg/ml protease inhibitors. The lysates were centrifuged (15,000 × g, 4 °C for 10 min), and 500 μg of protein was incubated overnight at 4 °C with the monoclonal antibody, 6A7. The antibody only recognizes and interacts with the activated form of Bax. Then 30 μl of anti-mouse IgG1-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) were added, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C. After washing extensively with CHAPS lysis buffer and boiling the mixture, the released proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (12% gel) and transferred to a nitrocellulous membrane. The level of activated Bax was detected by Western blotting (15Cheng J. Cui R. Chen C.-H. Du J. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 2085-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Cell Death ELISA—Histone-associated DNA fragments were quantitated by ELISA (Roche Applied Science). VSMC from each well were collected by trypsinization and pelleted (200 × g, 5 min), lysed, and subjected to the ELISA according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each experiment was carried out in triplicate and repeated independently at least three times. Histological Examination—Aortas from wild mice and ApoE−/- were collected. Cryostat aortic sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, blocked the endogenous peroxidase activity with 3% H2O2 in methanol for 15 min, and washed in PBS, pH 7.4. Triple immunostaining was performed as described (16Merched A.J. Chan L. Circulation. 2004; 110: 3830-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). First, we detected apoptotic cells using a TUNEL kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Then sections were incubated for 30 min with different monoclonal antibodies individually (goat anti-β3 integrin or rabbit anti-α-SM actin followed by a rhodamin-conjugated secondary antibody. The slides were examined for specific immunofluorescence using fluorescent microscope. Before the third immunostaining, the same slides were washed in PBS, incubated with the third primary antibody against integrin β3(β3 integrin blocking peptide was used as a control for specific staining) or α-smooth muscle actin, and exposed to peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. NovaRed (Vector, Burlingame, CA) was used as a substrate for peroxidase. Statistics—All of the data are presented as the means ± S.E. Comparison between groups were made using one-way analysis of variance. The values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Integrin αVβ3 Expression Is Increased in the Arch of the Aorta—We examined the expression of integrin αVβ3 partly because it can prevent vascular cells from apoptosis (17Choi E.T. Khan M.F. Leidenfrost J.E. Collins E.T. Boc K.P. Villa B.R. Novack D.V. Parks W.C. Abendschein D.R. Circulation. 2004; 109: 1564-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Integrin β3 expression in the aortic arch was substantially increased compared with results from thoracic descending arteries in wild type mice fed with a normal chow (Fig. 1A). Because the aortic arch is subjected to increased mechanical stretch whereas distal thoracic descending arteries have less turbulence and reduced mechanical stress, it is possible that mechanical stretch in vivo is responsible at least in part for the up-regulation of integrin β3. To determine whether abnormal hemodynamics play a role in modulating integrin β3 expression, we studied cultured VSMC that were subjected to mechanical stretch. Our data show significant increase in integrin β3 expression in response to mechanical stretch of VSMC. Curiously, this was not a uniform response in terms of other integrins. For example, integrin β1 protein expression did not increase in these cells (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, we found that mechanical stretch markedly increased the levels of integrin β3 mRNA (peaked at 2 h; Fig. 1C). In addition, mechanical stretch increased the integrin β3 promoter activity; 3.92 ± 0.37-fold increase compared with values in unstretched, control cells, p < 0.05; n = 3; Fig. 1D). Mechanical Stretch of VSMC or Forced Expression of αVβ3 in VSMC Inhibits Ox-LDL-induced Apoptosis—After 45 weeks of a normal chow, there were advanced atherosclerosis lesions in ApoE−/- mice. We found that integrin αVβ3 expression was inversely associated with TUNEL-positive staining. Quantitatively, approximately less than 3% of integrin αVβ3 positive VSMC were also positive of TUNEL. These data indicate that in vivo, integrin αVβ3 expression is associated with survival in VSMC (Fig. 2, A–F). Treatment of VSMC with 50 μg/ml of copper-oxidized Ox-LDL induced DNA fragmentation (Fig. 2G, left panel, TUNEL assay). To exclude nonspecific reactions to copper, we examined the effects of treating VSMC with the “oxidized” L5 fraction of LDL directly isolated from patients with familial dyslipidemia (15Cheng J. Cui R. Chen C.-H. Du J. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 2085-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). VSMC underwent a similar apoptotic response (Fig. 2H). We then examined the relationship between mechanical stretch and VSMC apoptosis. After 24 h of mechanical stretch (2 h, 15% stretch), VSMC were exposed to Ox-LDL for 6 h, we found that TUNEL-positive (green) apoptotic cells were fewer in cells subjected to mechanical stretch and Ox-LDL compared with cells that had not been prestimulated by mechanical stretch (42.7 ± 6.3% versus 25 ± 3.1%; Fig. 2G). To determine whether the anti-apoptosis effect of mechanical stretch is a specific cause-effect relationship with integrin β3, we transfected VSMC with a siRNA against integrin β3 and successfully knocked down integrin β3 (Fig. 2I, inset). This treatment significantly (p < 0.05) impaired mechanical stretch-mediated protection from Ox-LDL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2I). Using VSMC isolated from integrin β3 null mice, we confirmed that the protective effect of stretch against Ox-LDL-induced apoptosis is significantly (p < 0.01) attenuated (Fig. 2J). To avoid possible long term genetic reprogramming effects, integrin β3 cDNA was re-expressed into β3 null cells, and the antiapoptotic effect was regained in these cells (Fig. 2J). Taken together, these data demonstrated clearly that integrin β3 was responsible for the mechanical stretch-mediated protection of VSMC against the Ox-LDL-induced apoptosis. Integrin β3-mediated Suppression of Ox-LDL-induced Apoptosis Involves the Cytoskeleton—Integrin functions in modulating cytoskeleton mechanical stability by providing dynamic, bidirectional links between the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton (19Geiger B. Bershadsky A. Pankov R. Yamada K.M. Nat Rev Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1846) Google Scholar). When we examined changes in the cytoskeleton in Ox-LDL-treated VSMC, we found changes in cell shape including rounding and retraction (data not shown). In contrast, when we subjected VSMC to mechanical stretch or when we forced the expression of integrin β3 in VSMC, we found that Ox-LDL did not cause similar morphologic changes. We then examined the relative distribution of cytoskeletal F-actin and microtubules in VSMC that had been treated with Ox-LDL. As shown in Fig. 3A, when VSMC were exposed to Ox-LDL, there was substantial rearrangement and disruption of F-actin and microtubules. Individual stress fibers disappeared and F-actin became clustered around the nucleus in these cells. These findings suggest a substantial redistribution of F-actin filaments. In contrast, we found that mechanical stretch or forced expression of integrin β3 preserved F-actin and microtubule patterns (Fig. 3A). Our results raised the possibility that cytoskeletal disruption is a key process to the understanding of Ox-LDL-induced apoptosis. To test this possibility, we exposed VSMC to cytochalasin D (2 μm) or nocodazole (10 nm). These chemicals inhibited actin and microtubule polymerization but did not induce apoptosis (DNA fragmentation assay; Fig. 3B). We then applied mechanical stretch to wild type VSMC that were pretreated with cytochalasin D or nocodazole for 30 min before adding Ox-LDL. A cell death ELISA analysis showed that both reagents significantly impaired the ability of stretch to protect VSMC from Ox-LDL-induced apoptosis. Similar results were obtained in studies of cells with forced expression of integrin β3 (Fig. 3C). We conclude that the anti-apoptotic response induced by mechanical stretch or by increasing integrin αVβ3 expression resulted from stabilization of the cytoskeleton. The Downstream Event of Mechanical Stretch/Integrin β3/Cytoskeleton-mediated Suppression of Apoptosis Is Protection from Activation of Bax—Upon exposure to apoptotic stimuli, proapoptotic proteins such as Bim or Bmf are released from the cytoskeleton. These proteins activated Bax, which translocated to the mitochondrial outer membranes to cause a loss of the membrane potential and release of cytochrome c (20Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 21Mollinedo F. Gajate C. Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 413-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c release activated caspases, ultimately leading to apoptosis. In cultured VSMC, we found that Ox-LDL resulted in a conformational change in Bax (Fig. 4A, 3.7-fold increase compared with control, n = 3, p < 0.01). To test whether mechanical stretch inhibits this Bax activation, VSMC were subjected to stretch and then incubated with Ox-LDL. As shown in Fig. 4A, mechanical stretch prevented Ox-LDL-induced activation of Bax. Similarly, forced overexpression of integrin β3 blocked Ox-LDL-induced activation of Bax (Fig. 4B). However, either cytochalasin D or nocodazole abolished the ability of integrin β3 to prevent Bax activation (Fig. 4C). Mechanical Stretch Protects VSMC from Apoptosis by Stabilizing PINCH-1—PINCH-1 is a “hub” protein that connects integrin to the cytoskeleton and stabilizes it (22Wu C.

Either mechanical stretch or forced expression of integrin β3 prevented Ox-LDL-induced down-regulation of PINCH-1 (Fig. 5A). These results suggested that integrin β3 stabilized PINCH-1 to prevent Ox-LDL-induced apoptosis. To examine whether integrin β3 was necessary for mechanical stretch-mediated stabilization of PINCH-1, we studied VSMC isolated from integrin β3 null mice. We found that the loss of integrin β3 abolishes stretch-mediated stabilization of PINCH-1 in VSMC that was treated with Ox-LDL (Fig. 5B). Because Ox-LDL disrupted the cytoskeleton and down-regulated PINCH-1, we investigated whether there was a cause-effect sequence between decreased PINCH-1 and cytoskeletal disruption/apoptosis. We used two independent sets of siRNA against PINCH-1 and found that both sets knocked down PINCH-1 levels. In both cases, there was cytoskeleton disruption and cell rounding (Fig. 5C) as well as apoptosis (Fig. 5D). In addition, we found that down-regulation of PINCH-1 significantly enhanced the ability of Ox-LDL to cause apoptosis (Fig. 5E). Importantly, down-regulation of PINCH-1 also abolished integrin β3-mediated protection from Ox-LDL-activation of Bax in VSMC subjected to mechanical stretch (Fig. 5F). Thus, our studies revealed a pathway initiated by Ox-LDL, which suppresses PINCH-1 expression, causing cytoskeletal disruption, BAX activation, and apoptosis. To further establish a causative link between integrin β3 and PINCH-1-dependent regulation of apoptosis, we forced expression of PINCH-1 in integrin β3 null cells and found that expression of PINCH-1 in β3 null cells prevent Ox-LDL-induced Bax activation and apoptosis (Fig. 5, G and H). To provide a link between integrin β3 and PINCH-1 in vivo, we examined the expression of these proteins in aorta arch and descending arteries from both wild type and β3 null mice. As shown in Fig. 5I, when integrin β3 is deleted, both PINCH-1 and ILK-1 were also lower in the arteries from β3 null mice, whereas integrin β1 remained the same. These results lead to the hypothesis that stabilization of PINCH-1 by integrins suppresses apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, we established a VSMC line with forced overexpression of integrin β1 (Fig. 6A). Our data show that stabilization of PINCH-1 by integrin β1 also protected the cells from Ox-LDL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6B). Accumulation of VSMC is a hallmark of neointimal formation, the “soil” of atherosclerosis (24Schwartz S.M. deBlois D. O'Brien E.R.M. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 445-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). This occurs despite the activation of specific signaling pathways that should cause VSMC to undergo apoptosis (8Napoli C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 1010: 698-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 9Salvayre R. Auge N. Benoist H. Negre-Salvayre A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). We found that integrin αVβ3 was a major determinant of Ox-LDL-induced apoptosis. This was because an increase in integrin αVβ3 expression prevented Ox-LDL-induced apoptosis in VSMC. Our results identify a connection between this integrin β3-dependent pathway and atherosclerosis. First, we found that in the aortic arch with higher turbulence, there was an increased expression of integrin β3 (Fig. 1A). Second, we found an inverse correlation between the expression of integrin β3 in advanced atherosclerotic lesion (ApoE−/- mice) and apoptosis identified as TUNEL-positive staining (Fig. 2, A–D). The integrin αVβ3-dependent mechanism that prevented apoptosis acted by increasing PINCH-1 expression, which caused stabilization of the cytoskeleton. This is important because when the cytoskeleton is intact, Ox-LDL no longer activates Bax, and hence, apoptosis is suppressed (summarized in Fig. 7). Thus, the mechanical stretch-mediated increase in expression of integrin αVβ3 is pro-atherogenic in the early phase of atherosclerosis. This is because it contributes to an imbalance between VSMC survival and apoptosis leading to VSMC accumulation in the early neointimal lesion of atherosclerosis. What Is Responsible for Increased Expression of αVβ3 Integrin in the Artery?—Atherosclerotic plaques exhibit a predictable distribution in the arterial tree, most often occurring in areas surrounding arterial bifurcations. This localization of atherosclerotic lesions is attributed to the generation of hemodynamic forces at the outer segments of bifurcations where shear stress is more variable (25Gimbrone M.A.J. Topper J.N. Nagel T. Anderson K.R. Garcia-Cardena G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 902: 230-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). The role of hemodynamic forces in atherogenesis was supported by results from cultured vascular cells; cyclic mechanical stretch stimulated the prolonged expression of several vasoactive factors (26Xu Q. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine. 2000; 10: 35Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the arch of the aorta, we found that integrin β3 expression is high compared with results from descending thoracic aortic segments with much less turbulence and mechanical stress (Fig. 1A). Our study in cultured VSMC confirms that cyclic stretch induces the expression of integrin β3 (at both the transcriptional and protein level; Fig. 1, B–D). Evidence for a specific cause-effect role of integrin β3 included: knockdown of integrin β3 using a siRNA against integrin β3 or studies of a null deletion of integrin β3 abolished mechanical stretch-mediated protection from Ox-LDL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2, I and J). We found that mechanical stretch only increased the expression of integrin β3 in VSMC (Fig. 1B), suggesting that there was a physiological specificity for integrin β3. We concluded that stretch-induced expression of integrin β3 counteracts the Ox-LDL-induced apoptotic responses. These results are consistent with the report that null deletion of integrin β3 significantly reduces injury-induced neointima formation (17Choi E.T. Khan M.F. Leidenfrost J.E. Collins E.T. Boc K.P. Villa B.R. Novack D.V. Parks W.C. Abendschein D.R. Circulation. 2004; 109: 1564-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). How Does Increased Expression of Integrin αVβ3 Prevent Apoptosis?—We found that Ox-LDL caused disorganization of the cytoskeleton (Fig. 3A). This observation is important because disorganization of the cytoskeleton has been shown to release members of the BH3 family of pro-apoptotic proteins (e.g. Bim and Bmf), which can activate the pro-apoptotic Bax (21Mollinedo F. Gajate C. Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 413-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Our results showed that either mechanical stretch or forced expression of integrin αVβ3 prevented cytoskeletal disruption when the cells were treated with Ox-LDL. This was consistent with an important role of cytoskeleton stabilization in preventing the activation of Bax (21Mollinedo F. Gajate C. Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 413-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Our current study established a mechanism by which stretch prevents Ox-LDL-induced cytoskeletal disruption and apoptosis. We have uncovered a cellular pathway that influences the degree of VSMC responses to Ox-LDL. Specifically, Ox-LDL down-regulated PINCH-1 (Fig. 5A), a key hub protein linking integrin with the cytoskeleton (10Wu C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4485-4489PubMed Google Scholar). PINCH-1 is known to play an essential role in mediating integrin signaling through the cytoskeleton (10Wu C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4485-4489PubMed Google Scholar, 11Xu Z. Fukuda T. Li Y. Zha X. Qin J. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27631-27637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 12Fukuda T. Chen K. Shi X. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51324-51333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and we found that knockdown PINCH-1 caused depolymerization of the cytoskeleton, VSMC rounding, and apoptosis (Fig. 5, C–E). We also found that mechanical stretch prevented Ox-LDL-induced down-regulation of PINCH-1 in wild type VSMC but not in β3−/- cells (Fig. 5, A and B). Consistent with this pathway, knockdown of PINCH-1 in VSMC with forced expression of integrin αVβ3 still destabilized the cytoskeleton, activated Bax, and caused apoptosis (Fig. 5, E and F). Moreover, forced expression of PINCH-1 in β3 null cells prevented Ox-LDL-induced activation of Bax and apoptosis (Fig. 5, G and H). Lastly, the level of integrin β3 was closely correlated with PINCH-1 and its downstream signal ILK-1. Furthermore, the loss of integrin β3 is associated with lower level of PINCH-1 and ILK-1 in the arch of aorta and descending arteries (Fig. 5I). These data established a functional/causative link between integrin β3 expression and PINCH-1-dependent regulation of apoptosis. These data also indicated that stabilization of PINCH-1 in response to either mechanical stretch or via an increase in integrin αVβ3 is an important mechanism that protects VSMC from apoptosis. Interestingly, we found that overexpression of integrin β1 in VSMC also protected the cells from Ox-LDL-induced down-regulation of PINCH-1, disruption of cytoskeleton, and apoptosis (Fig. 6). These data indicated that the protective effect of PINCH-1 stabilization on Ox-LDL-induced apoptosis was not specific to integrin β3. However, because mechanical stretch only increased the expression of integrin β3 in VSMC but not integrin β1 (Fig. 1B), the physiological role of stretch was to increase integrin β3. As summarized in Fig. 7, our results uncovered a novel physiological and pathological role for mechanical stretch-induced integrin αVβ3 in promoting VSMC survival even when Ox-LDL levels were high. The uncovered cell signaling pathway contributes to the inhibition of down-regulation of PINCH-1 and thereby stabilized the cytoskeleton to suppress activation of Bax. Our results clearly demonstrated that mechanical stretch acts as an early pro-atherogenic role to prevent VSMC apoptosis at an early phase leading to VSMC accumulation. In this way, integrin αVβ3 expression influences the balance between VSMC apoptosis and survival. We are indebted to Dr. W. E. Mitch for helpful discussions and critical reading of this manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1995560850,"Basonuclin (Bnc1), a cell-type-specific ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene regulator, is expressed mainly in keratinocytes of stratified epithelium and gametogenic cells of testis and ovary. Previously, basonuclin was shown in vitro to interact with rRNA gene (rDNA) promoter at three highly conserved sites. Basonuclin's high affinity binding site overlaps with the binding site of a dedicated and ubiquitous Pol I transcription regulator, UBF, suggesting that their binding might interfere with each other if they bind to the same promoter. Knocking-down basonuclin in mouse oocytes eliminated approximately one quarter of RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription foci, without affecting the BrU incorporation of the remaining ones, suggesting that basonuclin might regulate a subset of rDNA. Here we show, via chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), that basonuclin is associated with rDNA promoters in HaCaT cells, a spontaneously established human keratinocyte line. Immunoprecipitation data suggest that basonuclin is in a complex that also contains the subunits of Pol I (RPA194, RPA116), but not UBF. Knocking-down basonuclin in HaCaT cells partially impairs the association of RPA194 to rDNA promoter, but not that of UBF. Basonuclin-deficiency also reduces the amount of 47S pre-rRNA, but this effect can be seen only after cell-proliferation related rRNA synthesis has subsided at a higher cell density. DNA sequence of basonuclin-bound rDNA promoters shows single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that differ from those associated with UBF-bound promoters, suggesting that basonuclin and UBF interact with different subsets of promoters. In conclusion, our results demonstrate basonuclin's functional association with rDNA promoters and its interaction with Pol I in vivo. Our data also suggest that basonuclin-Pol I complex transcribes a subset of rDNA."

Bacteriophage T4 remains an ideal model system in which to study the fundamental mechanisms of nucleic acid metabolism. DNA replication is particularly well suited for study in T4 because the viral genome encodes all the necessary replicative enzymes and accessory proteins that exist in higher organisms (1Miller E.S. Kutter E. Mosig G. Arisaka F. Kunisawa T. Rüger W. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 86-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). During the early stage of the T4 infection cycle, DNA synthesis is initiated by a classic origin-dependent mechanism in which replication complexes are assembled onto persistent R-loops (RNA-DNA hybrids) (2Nossal N.G. Dudas K.C. Kreuzer K.N. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, this mechanism is quickly abandoned, and during the later stages of infection the switch is made to the more efficient recombination-dependent replication (RDR) 6The abbreviations used are: RDR, recombination-dependent replication; PDB, Protein Data Bank; R.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; HJ, Holliday junctions; ss, single-stranded; ds, double-stranded. 6The abbreviations used are: RDR, recombination-dependent replication; PDB, Protein Data Bank; R.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; HJ, Holliday junctions; ss, single-stranded; ds, double-stranded. to synthesize the bulk of the DNA (3Kreuzer K.N. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 43-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). RDR produces a complex concatemeric network of T4 DNA that is ultimately resolved into the circularly permuted and terminally redundant genome that exists within the mature virus particles. The initiation stage of RDR is a recombination reaction in which the 3′-end of a single-stranded region of T4 DNA invades a homologous region of DNA to generate a displacement (D) loop intermediate. The T4 replication machinery is then assembled within the D loop to begin replication from the invading 3′-end (3Kreuzer K.N. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 43-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Homologous recombination is a key process in DNA metabolism that remains poorly understood at the molecular level, and T4 is an ideal system in which to study the mechanism due to its central role in RDR and T4 replication. The T4 proteins UvsX and UvsY perform equivalent functions to the recombination proteins Rad51 and Rad52, respectively, in eukaryotic systems (4Beernink H.T. Morrical S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 385-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). UvsX and UvsY are both members of the uvsWXY system, which is associated with susceptibility to DNA damage because of UV radiation (hence the name). This is consistent with the roles that recombination and RDR are now known to play in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (5Klein H.L. Kreuzer K.N. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 471-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been known for some time that stalled and collapsed replication forks can lead to DNA double-strand breaks (6Cox M.M. Goodman M.F. Kreuzer K.N. Sherratt D.J. Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. Nature. 2000; 404: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar), and RDR has a pivotal role in repairing the lesions generated by these potentially lethal events (7McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 859-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Thus, T4 has also emerged as a model system for studying the molecular basis of the DNA repair processes that serve to maintain genome stability. UvsW is a T4-encoded protein that was first identified through mutations that have multiple and seemingly diverse effects on T4 DNA metabolism (8Derr L.K. Drake J.W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 222: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 9Derr L.K. Kreuzer K.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 643-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The uvsW gene is the third member of the uvsWXY system, and the multiple roles of UvsW were rationalized by in vitro and in vivo studies which revealed that it can catalyze a variety of nucleic acid processing functions as an ATP-dependent helicase (10Carles-Kinch K. George J.W. Kreuzer K.N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4142-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Primary sequence analyses (10Carles-Kinch K. George J.W. Kreuzer K.N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4142-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) revealed the presence of seven conserved helicase motifs that are involved in substrate binding and hydrolysis (11Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 12Hall M.C. Matson S.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 867-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The motifs specifically suggested that UvsW belongs to the SF2 family of helicases, and this was confirmed by the 2.3-Å crystal structure of a stable N-terminal fragment of the inactive UvsW point mutant K141R (UvsWNF) (13Sickmier E.A. Kreuzer K.N. White S.W. Structure. 2004; 12: 583-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The fragment comprises a small N-terminal domain that is structurally homologous to the DNA-binding domain of the T4 transcription factor MotA (14Li N. Sickmier E.A. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. White S.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and the first RecA-like motor domain (1A) that has been observed in all monomeric helicase structures to date (15Singleton M.R. Dillingham M.S. Wigley D.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 23-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). UvsW is also involved in the switch from early origin-dependent to late replication-dependent replication during the T4 infection cycle, and specifically catalyzes the disassembly of R-loops that act as primers at replication origins (16Dudas K.C. Kreuzer K.N. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 2706-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). During our structural analysis of UvsWNF, we identified an error in the T4 genome sequence that results in a shorter UvsW open reading frame and the generation of a new open reading frame that encodes a 76-amino acid protein now referred to as UvsW.1. This open reading frame is highly conserved in T4-related viruses, and this suggests that the function of UvsW.1 is somehow related to that of UvsW. It was recently shown that there exists a direct and functional interaction between UvsW and UvsW.1 (17Nelson S.W. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 407-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Here we report the crystal structure of full-length UvsW and the NMR solution structure of UvsW.1. Unsurprisingly, the missing C-terminal region of our earlier truncated UvsWNF structure comprises the second (2A) RecA-like motor domain, and the closest structural homolog to full-length UvsW is Rad54. UvsW.1 has a simple four-helical bundle structure that has structural similarities to the HRDC motif found in RecQ helicases. Overexpression and Purification—The full-length UvsW-K141R construct was provided by Dr. Kenneth Kreuzer (Duke University Medical Center). The gene was subcloned into the pET28a expression vector (Novagen) between the NcoI and XhoI restriction sites to attach a C-terminal His6 tag for convenient purification. Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus® (DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene) were transformed with the construct and grown at 37 °C in 1 liter of LB containing 50 μgml−1 kanamycin and 36 μgml−1 chloramphenicol until the A600 reached 0.4. Overexpression was initiated by addition of 0.03 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the induced cells were grown for a further 16 h at 16 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2300 × g for 15 min and resuspended in 50 ml of buffer A (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, 2 m NaCl) and two Complete Protease Inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science). The mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min and lysed in an M-110L Microfluidizer® (Microfluidics). To remove nonspecifically bound DNA from the protein, polyethylenimine (Sigma) was gradually added to the lysate to a final concentration of 0.1% followed by 10 min of stirring, and the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to remove precipitated DNA. The supernatant was brought to 25% ammonium sulfate saturation on ice, followed by stirring for 1 h, and the precipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min and redissolved in buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6 and 500 mm NaCl). The solution was dialyzed overnight against 4 liters of buffer (B) and filtered through a 0.45-μm syringe filter (Nalgene). The filtrate was applied to a HisTrap™ HP column (GE Healthcare), and the column washed with 200 ml of buffer C (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 500 mm NaCl and 5 mm imidazole). Proteins were eluted using an imidazole gradient from 5 to 500 mm, and fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. UvsW-K141R fractions were pooled and concentrated using an Amicon Ultra 10-kDa cutoff membrane (Millipore). The final purification step involved size exclusion chromatography using a Hi Load® 26/60 Superdex® 200 column with buffer D (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Pure UvsW-K141R was concentrated to 11 mg/ml and stored at -80 °C. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Solution—Commercial screening kits were used to determine crystallization conditions at 18 °C. The hanging-drop vapor diffusion method was employed with a reservoir volume of 700 μl, and drops consisted of 1 μl of protein (4-11 mg ml−1) and 1 μl of precipitant. The final, optimized conditions were 1.0 m sodium malonate pH 7.0, 11 mg ml−1 protein, and these yielded crystals of dimensions 0.1 × 0.1 × 0.2 mm3. Cryoprotection was achieved by briefly soaking the crystals in 1.0 m sodium malonate pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 50% glycerol, and a 2.7-Å dataset was collected from a single crystal at the Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team (SER-CAT) 22-ID beamline at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory. Data were collected in 1° oscillations using a crystal-to-detector distance of 300 mm and 3-s exposures, and integrated, scaled, and merged using the HKL2000 package (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38444) Google Scholar). UvsW-K141R crystals belong to space group C2221 with unit cell dimensions a = 118.6 Å, b = 155.2 Å, c = 101.5 Å. The structure was determined by molecular replacement using the CCP4 program MOLREP (19Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4136) Google Scholar), and the N-terminal fragment UvsWNF (PDB code 1RIF) as the search model. A clear solution was obtained with an R-factor of 51.5% and a correlation coefficient of 0.52, and the missing C-terminal domain was clearly visible in the 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc electron density maps and traced using COOT (20Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23002) Google Scholar) and O (21Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Open table in a new tab Sample Preparation—The uvsw.1 gene was obtained by PCR with appropriate primers from T4 genomic DNA (provided by Dr. Kenneth Kreuzer, Duke University Medical Center) and cloned into the expression vector pET11d (Novagen) using NdeI and BamH1 restriction sites such that a His6 tag was placed at the N terminus. Unlabeled and 13C/15N-labeled UvsW.1 was expressed in separate colonies of BL21 (DE3) cells. For the 13C/15N-labeled samples, cells were grown in minimal media with 4 g of [13C]glucose and 1.0 g of 15NH4Cl per liter. Following induction with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 3 h of additional growth, the cells were lysed using a sonicator, and UvsW.1 was purified from the clarified supernatant using a Ni2+ chelation column. The His6 tag was removed from the protein using a thrombin digestion, and the mixture was passed through a nickel column for a second time to remove protein that still contained the His6 tag. The final purification step involved size exclusion chromatography using a Hi Load® 26/60 Superdex® 200 column with buffer E (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Pure UvsW.1 was concentrated by ultrafiltration to 5 mg/ml and stored at -80 °C. NMR Analysis—The backbone chemical shift assignments were obtained using a standard triple resonance assignment strategy through the analysis of two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC and three-dimensional HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB, and CBCA(CO)NH spectra recorded using a 600 MHz Varian INOVA NMR spectrometer at 25 °C and pulse sequences provided by the manufacturer. The side chain assignments were obtained through the analysis of three-dimensional C(CO)NH-TOCSY, H(CCO)NH-TOCSY, HCCH-COSY, and HCCH-TOCSY spectra. 1H-1H distance restraints were obtained through the analysis of 15N- and 13C-edited three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC spectra (mixing time, 120 ms), which were recorded using an 800 MHz Bruker AVANCE NMR spectrometer equipped with a TCI cryogenic probe.

NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11446) Google Scholar) and Felix (Accelrys) software were used for NMR data processing, display, and analysis. Structure Calculation and Refinement—The NOE assignments and structure calculations were performed iteratively using the program ARIA 2.1 (25Nilges M. Macias M.J. O'Donoghue S.I. Oschkinat H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 408-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) as interfaced with the structure computation program CNS (22Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16947) Google Scholar). A total of 1,976 unambiguous distance restraints and 98 dihedral restraints were used for the final structure calculation. Secondary 13Cα chemical shift values, corresponding to the difference of experimental and random coil values (Δδ 13Cα) (26Schwarzinger S. Kroon G.J. Foss T.R. Chung J. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 2970-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), for UvsW.1 were used to generate dihedral restraints using the program TALOS (27Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2731) Google Scholar). Final structure calculation was performed with 100 randomly generated starting structures. The fifty lowest energy structures were used for further refinement using the program AMBER 9 (28Case D.A. Cheatham III, T.E. Darden T. Gohlke H. Luo R. Merz Jr., K.M. Onufriev A. Simmerling C. Wang B. Woods R.J. J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1668-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (6412) Google Scholar). The structural refinement was performed using ff02 Amber force field. The solvent was implicitly represented by Generalized-Born model to represent a NaCl concentration of 0.1 m. The structures generated by ARIA were first energy-minimized for 2 ps. This was followed by a simulated annealing step where the temperature was increased to 800 K and then cooled to 0 K. The 20 lowest energy structures were then analyzed and validated using the program PROCHECK-NMR (29Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol.

The {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOE experiments were performed with a 4 s period of amide 1H saturation using a train of 120° hard pulses separated by a 5-ms delay, or a 4-s delay period, before the first 15N pulse (30Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2002) Google Scholar). The value of the {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOE (hetNOE) for each amide was calculated as the ratio of peak intensities in the irradiated (Iirrad) and non-irradiated (Icont) spectra (hetNOE value = Iirrad/Icont). To perform the proton-deuterium hydrogen exchange experiments, UvsW.1 in 50 mm phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol at pH 6.5 was lyophilized and then reconstituted in D2O prior to measurement of 1H-15N HSQC spectra. Overall Structure—We previously reported that the Walker A inactive point mutant UvsW-K141R (generated for functional studies) is considerably more soluble than wild-type UvsW, and this mutant was used for the initial structural studies of the stable N-terminal fragment (residues 1-282) that we refer to as UvsWNF (13Sickmier E.A. Kreuzer K.N. White S.W. Structure. 2004; 12: 583-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). UvsW-K141R was also used to generate the crystals of the full-length molecule (Met1-Leu502), and an additional Leu503 was added at the C terminus from the cloning procedure. Crystals in space group C2221 that diffracted to 2.7 Å were grown from sodium malonate pH 7.0, and the structure was determined by molecular replacement using the UvsWNF structure as a search model. The asymmetric unit contains one molecule of UvsWk141R, and the refined model is missing residues 287-295 that were not visible in the electron density. These residues correspond to the linker region that connects the two RecA-like motor domains. The structure of UvsW-K141R reveals that the full-length molecule comprises four domains, a small N-terminal domain (1B), two signature RecA-like domains 1A and 2A (15Singleton M.R. Dillingham M.S. Wigley D.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 23-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar) and a small substructure (2B) built from extensions from domain 2A. The structures, mode of interaction, and relative orientation of domains 1B and 1A are virtually identical to those observed in the UvsWNF structure (13Sickmier E.A. Kreuzer K.N. White S.W. Structure. 2004; 12: 583-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A least squares superimposition of UvsW-K141R onto each molecule of the UvsWNF asymmetric unit matches 271 and 278 α-carbon positions with r.m.s.d. values of 0.81 Å and 0.56 Å, respectively. The largest positional differences occur in two flexible loop regions (residues 31-51 and 262-269), and there are minor backbone torsional differences in residues 194-205. Fig. 1 shows an α-carbon trace of the newly characterized domains 2A and 2B, and Fig. 2 shows the primary structure and the associated secondary structure assignment of the entire molecule. Note that the secondary structure nomenclature now reflects the revised domain nomenclature, which differs from that previously reported (13Sickmier E.A. Kreuzer K.N. White S.W. Structure. 2004; 12: 583-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The structure of domain 2A is very similar to that of equivalent minimal RecA-like domains of other monomeric helicases as exemplified in the NS3 structure (31Kim J.L. Morgenstern K.A. Griffith J.P. Dwyer M.D. Thomson J.A. Murcko M.A. Lin C. Caron P.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 89-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). The structure is organized around a 7-stranded parallel β-sheet in which the strand order is β3A2-β4A2-β2A2-β5A2-β6A2-β1A2-β7A2, and six α-helices, α1A2 to α6A2, are packed around the β-sheet. The small 2B substructure comprises two α-helices, α1B2 and α2B2, that are inserted between β1A2 and α1A2, and a β-ribbon/loop connecting β6A2 and α6A2. This substructure cannot be considered an independently folded domain, but we label it as such to facilitate comparisons with other helical structures.FIGURE 2Primary sequence of UvsW. The sequence is shown in the one-letter code, and the secondary structure elements are indicated by the shaded segments. The SF2 helicase motifs are shown in underlined bold and are labeled. Note that the secondary structure elements are labeled A1, A2, B1, and B2 to reflect their domain location and to be consistent with previous structural studies of monomeric helicases.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 3A shows a scheme of the entire UvsW-K141R crystal structure in which the locations of key residues within the signature SF2 helicase motifs as defined by Hall and Matson (12Hall M.C. Matson S.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 867-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) are indicated. It can be seen that the motifs within the two domains are well separated, and an approximate 180° rotation of domains 2A and 2B is required to bring the motifs together to create the architecture that is typical of the monomeric helicases (15Singleton M.R. Dillingham M.S. Wigley D.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 23-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). We therefore believe that the observed crystal structure represents a non-functional conformation of the molecule. Fig. 3B shows the structure after this rotation has been performed relative to the NS3-ssDNA co-structure (1A1V), and it can be seen that the motif residues now adopt their typical positions in the vicinity of the 1A/2A domain interface. Therefore, the conformation shown in Fig. 3B will form the basis of subsequent discussions. Functional Regions—The seven SF2 helicase motifs are arranged in the typical fashion observed in other monomeric helicase structures (15Singleton M.R. Dillingham M.S. Wigley D.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 23-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar), and their locations within the UvsW primary structure are indicated in Fig. 2. Note that the assignment of motif IV differs from that described previously based on sequence analysis (10Carles-Kinch K. George J.W. Kreuzer K.N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4142-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Motifs I, II, III, and VI congregate at the 1A/2A domain interface and are involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis, and motifs IA, IV, and V have important roles in binding the translocating nucleic acid substrate (12Hall M.C. Matson S.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 867-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 15Singleton M.R. Dillingham M.S. Wigley D.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 23-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). Recently (32Tanner N.K. Cordin O. Banroques J. Doere M. Linder P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 127-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), an additional Q motif has been identified that serves to interact with the adenine ring of ATP, and this is present in UvsW as Q118 within helix α2A1 (Fig. 2). We previously used the structure of the NS3 RNA helicase bound to ssDNA to generate a putative model of a UvsWNF-ssDNA complex (13Sickmier E.A. Kreuzer K.N. White S.W. Structure. 2004; 12: 583-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and this model can now be expanded to include the full-length UvsW structure (Fig. 4). Four threonine residues, Thr166 and Thr167 in motif IA and the adjacent Thr211 and Thr214 are appropriately positioned to engage the DNA sugar phosphate backbone from domain 1A. Thr211 and Thr214 are within the TWQT sequence in UvsW that corresponds to the TXGX motif found in other helicases (33Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2643-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Lys355 and His356 within motif IV, and Ser404, Ser409, and Thr410 within motif V can all interact with DNA from domain 2A directly opposite from domain 1A. Sequence information is now available for a number of T4-like genomes, and they all contain UvsW homologs that show a high level of similarity. The functionally important motifs and residues described above are"

Experiments were carried out in buffer containing concentrations of two “inert” cosolutes, sucrose and Ficoll 70, a sucrose polymer, at concentrations up to 150 g/liter. Data analysis indicates that both cosolutes significantly accelerate the rate of refolding to native or compact near-native conformations, but decrease the fraction of catalytically active enzyme recovered in the limit of long time. According to the simplest model that fits the data, both cosolutes accelerate a competing side reaction yielding inactive compact species. Acceleration of the side reaction by Ficoll is significantly greater than that of sucrose at equal w/v concentrations.

It is now becoming more widely recognized that excluded volume effects arising from the presence of a high total concentration of macromolecules in almost all biological fluids may significantly affect both the conformation and association state of each species of macromolecule in the fluid, whether dilute or concentrated, in an entirely nonspecific manner (1Minton A.P. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1983; 55: 119-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 2Zimmerman S.B. Minton A.P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 27-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar, 3Hall D. Minton A.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1649: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Some years ago it was suggested on theoretical grounds that intermolecular excluded volume in a highly volume-occupied solution (termed “macromolecular crowding”) could stabilize the compact state relative to any less compact non-native state of a protein at equilibrium (4Minton A.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 5Minton A.P. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 971-985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 6Cheung M.S. Klimov D. Thirumalai D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4753-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). A number of experimental studies have qualitatively, and in some cases quantitatively confirmed this prediction (7Sasahara K. McPhie P. Minton A.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 1227-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 8Tokuriki N. Kinjo M. Negi S. Hoshino M. Goto Y. Urabe I. Yomo T. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, the effect of crowding upon the kinetics of protein isomerization is less predictable, as such effects depend in principle upon details of a particular reaction pathway (for example, the conformation of a transition state) that are for the most part unknown. Studies of the effects of macromolecular crowding on the rates of refolding of several denatured proteins, including reduced lysozyme (9van den Berg B. Ellis R. Dobson C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6927-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and protein-disulfide isomerase (10Li J. Zhang S. Wang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34396-34401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (11Ren G. Lin Z. Tsou C. Wang C. J. Protein Chem. 2003; 22: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and GroEL (12Galán A. Sot B. Llorca O. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. Muga A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 957-964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), following reexposure to native-favoring conditions, have been reported. As noted earlier (13Minton A.P. J. Pharm. Sci. 2005; 94: 1668-1675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), with the exception of lysozyme, all of the other proteins listed are homo-oligomers in the native state. Hence regain of native structure or enzymatic activity is a complex process involving refolding and association of polypeptide chains, both of which are subject to crowding effects (6Cheung M.S. Klimov D. Thirumalai D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4753-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 14Rivas G. Fernández J.A. Minton A.P.

In addition, enzymatic activity was only partially regained in the presence of “inert” crowding agents, indicating the presence of misfolding and/or aggregation, neither of which was taken into account in interpreting the data. To circumvent some of the difficulties associated with interpretation of the results of prior studies, we have studied the effect of a neutral “inert” polymer, Ficoll 70, on kinetics of the recovery of enzymatic activity of a simple protein, carbonic anhydrase B (CAB, 2The abbreviations used are: CAB, bovine carbonic anhydrase B; GuHCl, guanidinium chloride; pNPA, p-nitrophenylacetate, substrate for the esterase reaction catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase; pNP, p-nitrophenolate ion, hydrolysis product arising from the degradation of the substrate. 2The abbreviations used are: CAB, bovine carbonic anhydrase B; GuHCl, guanidinium chloride; pNPA, p-nitrophenylacetate, substrate for the esterase reaction catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase; pNP, p-nitrophenolate ion, hydrolysis product arising from the degradation of the substrate. 30 kDa) that is a monomer in solution and lacks disulfide cross-links. Ficoll 70 was selected as a macromolecular crowding agent because it is a highly cross-linked copolymer of sucrose and epichlorhydrin that is significantly more compact than linear polymers, so the viscosity of highly concentrated solutions remains substantially lower than that of comparable linear polymers (for example, dextrans) at the same w/v concentration. To more clearly delineate the role of cosolute size we have also conducted a parallel study of the effect of sucrose, the “monomer” of Ficoll, on the rate of refolding of carbonic anhydrase. Bovine carbonic anhydrase B (CAB) was purchased from Biozyme Laboratories (London, England) and used without further purification. Protein concentration was spectroscopically measured using an extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 4.5 × 104m–1 cm–1 for native carbonic anhydrase (manufacturerŉs specification) and a calculated 3.8 × 104m–1 cm–1 for denatured CAB. Ficoll 70 and p-nitrophenylacetate (pNPA) were obtained from Sigma and 100% acetonitrile (Pierce) was used to prepare 20 mm stock solutions of the substrate that were kept at 4 °C and always used within 10 days of preparation. Histidine and dipicolinic acid were from ICN and Sigma, respectively. Dilution of the substrate into dilution buffers for measurements was made just before use, yielding a final acetonitrile concentration of 0.16% which does not affect the pH of the solution (21Pocker Y. Stone J.T. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 668-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) or the structure and activity of carbonic anhydrase (22Safarian S. Saffarzadeh M. Zargar S.J. Moosavi-Movahedi A.A. J. Biochem. 2006; 139: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Sucrose and guanidinium chloride (GuHCl) were from Invitrogen. Solutions of the protein, substrate, denaturant and crowders were prepared by dilution into 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer (ICN), pH 7.5, containing Ficoll 70 or sucrose as required. The increase in solution viscosity arising from addition of Ficoll 70 to a final concentration of 150 g/liter is around 15%. CD Spectroscopy—CAB spectra in the near and far UV-CD spectra were recorded at around 17 μm and 3.5 μm, respectively, at room temperature using a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter, using 1 cm and 0.1 cm path length quartz cells and a scan rate of 50 nm·min–1. Addition of Ficoll 70 impaired in all cases data acquisition below 205 nm. The buffer signal was subtracted from the experimental data, and the corrected ellipticities were converted into mean residue ellipticities [θ] using a mean molecular mass per residue of 112 for carbonic anhydrase (Mw 29047.87 calculated from amino acid sequence, 259 residues). Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Emission spectra of native and denatured carbonic anhydrase (excited at 280 nm) were recorded at a protein concentration of around 4.5 μm at 25 °C in a PTI Quantamaster spectrofluorometer using 1-cm path length quartz cuvettes. An intensity control with quinine was performed daily. Fluorescence intensities were corrected by subtraction of blanks. Solutions were manually mixed before data collection. Time-dependent Activity Measurements—The irreversible hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate pNPA to the colored product p-nitrophenolate ion (pNP) was monitored spectrophotometrically by absorbance at 400 nm, a wavelength at which neither substrate nor cosolute absorb. CAB was incubated in a denaturing buffer containing 5 m GuHCl for around 1 h. Shortly before completion of incubation, a stock solution of substrate was diluted into renaturing buffers containing different concentrations of Ficoll 70 or sucrose and 99 μl of renaturing buffer loaded into individual wells of a 96-well half-area plate. To initiate the refolding reaction simultaneously in all wells, 1 μl of the protein solution (≈33 μm) was placed on the wall of each well above the substrate solution, and mixing of enzyme and substrate achieved by centrifuging the plate for 5 min at 4000 rpm. Absorbance of each well at 400 nm was then read at 1-min intervals over a period of 4 h in a Spectramax 250 or Spectramax 190 spectrophotometric plate reader (Molecular Devices). The contents of the microplate were mixed for 3 s prior to each absorbance reading using the automatic shaking option of the plate reader. The final 100-μl reaction volume in each well had a calculated optical path length of 5.27 ± 0.01 mm. Refolding experiments and controls with native protein and baseline under the same conditions were always performed in duplicate, and the time dependence of mean absorbance was analyzed as described below after normalizing to 1 cm path length. Analysis of Time-dependent Absorbance Measurements—Preliminary experiments established that absorbance at 400 nm is proportional to the concentration of the product pNP generated by hydrolysis of substrate pNPA. Thus the time-dependence of absorbance may be written as Equation 1, [A(t)=A0+α[P](t)(Eq. 1) where A0 denotes the baseline absorbance, α is an extinction coefficient, and [P] the concentration of product. It follows that Equation 2, d[P]dt=βdA∗dt(Eq. 2) where A* denotes the baseline-corrected absorbance A – Ao and β = 1/α. The hydrolysis of substrate may occur spontaneously or be catalyzed by enzyme. Thus we obtain the mass action rate expression in Equation 3, d[P]dt=(kb+ke[E])[S](Eq. 3) where kb denotes a pseudo-first-order rate constant for spontaneous (“background”) hydrolysis, and ke denotes an effective second-order rate constant for enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis, assuming that the enzyme obeys Michaelis-Menten kinetics, i.e. ke = kcat/Km. We further define the quantity fA as the fraction of total enzyme ETOT that is catalytically active. Equation 4 follows. d[P]dt=(kb+keETOTfA)[S](Eq. 4) This equation may be solved to yield Equation 5, A∗(t)=Amax∗{1−exp[J(t)]}(Eq. 5) where A*max is the baseline-corrected absorbance corresponding to the stoichiometric conversion of all substrate to product (=αStot), and Equation 6. J(t)≡−kbt−keETOT∫0tfAdt(Eq. 6) Recovery of enzyme activity is modeled by an exponential Equation 7, fA(t)=f∞[1−e−t/tf](Eq. 7) where f∞ denotes the fraction of active protein in the limit of long time and tf the relaxation time for refolding. Equation 8 follows. ∫0tfAdt=f∞(t−tf[1−e−t/tf])(Eq. 8) Although the time-dependent recovery of activity could in principle be more complex than the simple exponential indicated in Equation 7, it is demonstrated below that the use of a single exponential to describe the time dependence of fA is sufficient to describe our results to within experimental uncertainty. Selection of Conditions for Renaturation Experiments—CAB was incubated at several guanidinium chloride concentrations ranging from 0 to 6 m. At 2 m denaturant concentration the minimum in ellipticity at around 210 nm is lost, and there is a progressive loss in signal up to 5 m GuHCl. The measured dependence of ellipticity at 222 nm upon GuHCl concentration (Fig. 1) indicates that the protein maintains a nearly native conformation up to 1 m and is essentially fully unfolded at 4 m and above. When denatured enzyme was diluted according to the developed activity measurement protocol into renaturing buffer with a final GuHCl concentration of 0.05 m, it was found that the native CD ellipticity and enzymatic activity were recovered within the dead time of our measurements (<10 min, not shown). Activity measurements of carbonic anhydrase at different final GuHCl concentrations were also performed in order to determine the denaturant concentration at which the reaction is retarded to an extent allowing us an accurate analysis of data. Carbonic anhydrase has a complete loss of activity at 2 m GuHCl (Fig. 1). Subsequent measurements of refolding kinetics were made by dilution of denatured protein into renaturing buffer containing a final concentration of 0.5 m GuHCl and 0.33 μm protein, except as noted. All the data presented here correspond to these experimental conditions.FIGURE 1Effect of denaturant concentration on the activity and spectroscopic characteristics of CAB.

Turbidity measurements under the same experimental conditions show no aggregation at this protein concentration. Effect of Carbonic Anhydrase Concentration on the Kinetics of Regain of Enzymatic Activity—The effect of enzyme concentration on the refolding pathway was checked by varying the protein concentration between 0.11 and 1 μm. Analysis of the data by Equations 5, 6, and 7 gave comparable results for the fitting parameters in the three cases, except for the expected variation in the keETOT value. There was no significant effect on f∞ or tf with the increase in protein concentration (not shown), allowing us to discard the occurrence of significant aggregation on the time scale of refolding. Effect of Ficoll and Sucrose on the Spectroscopic Characteristics of CAB—The effect of Ficoll on the structural integrity of carbonic anhydrase was examined by comparing the CD spectra of native carbonic anhydrase in the absence and presence of 75 and 150 g/liter of Ficoll 70. The far UV-CD spectrum of the native protein is characterized by a minimum at around 215 nm typical of proteins with α/β structure (Fig. 2A). Secondary structure of carbonic anhydrase is not significantly affected by the presence of crowder, because there are only slight changes in the region between 215–220 nm and at around 230 nm that are within instrumental and experimental uncertainty (23Johnson Jr., W.C. Optical Activity and Structure of Biological Molecules, in Food Analysis: Principles and Techniques. Marcel Dekker, Inc, New York1984: 245-291Google Scholar). The influence of Ficoll upon tertiary structure is reflected in the shape of CD spectra in the near UV (23Johnson Jr., W.C. Optical Activity and Structure of Biological Molecules, in Food Analysis: Principles and Techniques. Marcel Dekker, Inc, New York1984: 245-291Google Scholar), which show a minimum at 270 nm and a series of minima and maxima between 280–300 nm (Fig. 2B). Near UV spectra are essentially unaffected by high Ficoll concentrations, suggesting the absence of specific interactions between the crowder and carbonic anhydrase (24Miles A.J. Wallace B.A. Chem. Soc. Rev. 2006; 35: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, given the sensitivity limits of CD, one cannot rule out small differences in structure that may affect carbonic anhydrase activity. Controls with similar concentrations of sucrose showed no effect of the sugar on the secondary and tertiary structures of the protein (Fig. 2, A and B). The CD spectra of carbonic anhydrase in 5 m GuHCl in the absence and presence of Ficoll or sucrose at a concentration of 150 g/liter were essentially indistinguishable and featureless (not shown), indicating lack of any residual structure in 5 m GuHCl with or without cosolute. Fluorescence intensity of the denatured and native states of carbonic anhydrase was also measured (Fig. 2, C and D). Native carbonic anhydrase presents a broad band centered at 341 nm, while the unfolded form is characterized by a narrower band with maximum shifted to 351 nm and lower intensity. Ficoll 70 has no effect upon the fluorescence of the unfolded protein and only a slight diminishment of the intensity of native carbonic anhydrase fluorescence, which is not indicative of any major effect upon native structure. There was no significant difference between the spectrum of the native protein recorded just after its dilution into the Ficoll 70 solution and that of carbonic anhydrase previously stabilized in the crowder solutions (not shown), allowing us to neglect nonspecific effects arising from the dilution of the protein into the crowder. Effect of Ficoll and Sucrose on the Kinetics of Regain of Enzymatic Activity—In Fig. 3, A and B are plotted time-dependent absorbance profiles reflecting production of pNP, the product of both spontaneous and enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of pNPA, in the absence of enzyme (triangle), in the presence of native enzyme (circles), and in the presence of refolding enzyme (squares) in the absence and presence of sucrose (Fig. 3A) and Ficoll (Fig. 3B) at 50 and 150 g/liter. Comparable data were obtained at cosolute concentrations of 25, 75, and 100 g/liter (not shown). It is evident that the rate of non-enzymatic hydrolysis of pNPA is increased with increasing concentrations of both sucrose and Ficoll, the effect of sucrose being larger. The reduced difference between the product formation curves in the absence and presence of native enzyme leads to increased uncertainty in the analysis of the product formation curve obtained for refolding protein, as detailed below. Analysis of these profiles described in detail under “Discussion” reveals that the refolding protein does not fully regain native enzymatic activity even in the limit of long time, in qualitative accord with the results of an earlier study (25Wetlaufer D.B. Xie Y. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1535-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This result indicates the presence of one or more side reactions leading to non-native products, some of which could involve aggregation of the refolding protein. However, two experimental facts indicate the absence of significant aggregation accompanying protein refolding at the highly dilute protein concentration used in our activity measurements: (i) no time-dependent turbidity was detectable at 330 nm at any Ficoll concentration and (ii) there was no effect of protein concentration on the kinetics of refolding. For a given set of experimental conditions (i.e. concentration of cosolute) all three product accumulation curves were modeled globally using Equations 5, 6, and 8 to obtain best-fit values of the parameters kb, keETOT, f∞ and tf. 3This was accomplished by including in our model the condition that keETOT = 0 for the data set obtained in the absence of enzyme and fA(t) = 1 for all t for the data set obtained with native enzyme. The product accumulation curves calculated using best-fit parameter values obtained by this modeling procedure, which are plotted together with the data in Fig. 3, A and B, agree with the data to within the precision of measurement, and in almost all cases the distribution of residuals is random. The mean and 95% confidence limits (when determinable) of the best-fit parameter values obtained in 5–20 replicate measurements performed at each Ficoll and sucrose concentration are tabulated in Table 1 and the values of tf and f∞ plotted against cosolute concentration in Fig. 4, A and B. Best-fit linear regression lines are also plotted in this figure. The presence of increasing concentrations of Ficoll 70 or sucrose results in a decrease in the total amount of active protein recovered and an apparent decrease in the decay time of refolding that becomes immeasurably small at high additive concentrations because most of the refolding appears to take place within the dead time of our measurement (≈6.5 min). 4The increased rate of non-enzymatic hydrolysis of pNPA in the presence of high cosolute concentrations also contributes to a loss of experimental resolution, as mentioned above. The mean best-fit values of tf and f∞ at each cosolute concentration were used to calculate the fractional recovery as a function of time according to Equation 7, and these recovery curves are plotted in Fig. 5. There is a decrease in the value of keETOT estimated from the native control with increasing concentrations of cosolute. The fact that similar CD spectra are obtained in the presence of different Ficoll and sucrose concentrations (Fig. 2) suggests that the slowing in the reaction rate observed in the native activity is not due to any change in the native structure of the protein although, as previously stated, this possibility cannot be completely ruled out. Because ETOT is constant and only small changes due to experimental error can be expected, this effect could be accounted for by the hypothesis that the cosolutes hinder access of substrate to the active site of the enzyme, as previously suggested for other enzymes and crowding agents (26Derham B.K. Harding J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1764: 1000-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Effect of cosolutes on the kinetic parameters obtained by fitting time-dependent absorbance profiles of CABA0bA0nA0rAmaxkbkeETOTf∞logtfmmol/minmmol/mmol minNo additive0.084 ± 0.0020.092 ± 0.0040.089 ± 0.0020.625 ± 0.0160.0021 ± 6.94 10-50.0043 ± 0.00020.701 ± 0.0221.05 ± 0.04Ficoll 70 25 g/liter0.089 ± 0.0040.096 ± 0.0040.093 ± 0.0040.629 ± 0.0100.0024 ± 7.50 10-50.0047 ± 9.98 10-50.638 ± 0.0420.74 ± 0.20 50 g/liter0.097 ± 0.0020.102 ± 0.0020.103 ± 0.0020.618 ± 0.0120.0027 ± 4.06 10-50.0043 ± 0.00020.636 ± 0.0480.83 ± 0.12 75 g/liter0.102 ± 0.0040.110 ± 0.0040.108 ± 0.0040.631 ± 0.0120.0029 ± 14.7 10-50.0043 ± 0.00040.509 ± 0.048<0.86 100 g/liter0.106 ± 0.0040.111 ± 0.0040.113 ± 0.0060.611 ± 0.0180.0031 ± 15.3 10-50.0039 ± 0.00040.548 ± 0.038<0.91 150 g/liter0.110 ± 0.0060.118 ± 0.0060.119 ± 0.0060.611 ± 0.0260.0036 ± 0.00020.0034 ± 0.00060.467 ± 0.070<0.96Sucrose 25 g/liter0.090 ± 0.0040.095 ± 0.0020.096 ± 0.0040.659 ± 0.0560.0029 ± 15.1 10-50.0047 ± 0.00080.721 ± 0.0820.95 ± 0.10 50 g/liter0.095 ± 0.0020.102 ± 0.0020.102 ± 0.0020.648 ± 0.0260.0036 ± 9.06 10-50.0045 ± 19.2 10-50.664 ± 0.032<1.04 75 g/liter0.098 ± 0.0060.106 ± 0.0060.109 ± 0.0080.654 ± 0.0340.0042 ± 0.00040.0037 ± 0.00120.719 ± 0.1020.78 ± 0.14 100 g/liter0.105 ± 0.0040.114 ± 0.0020.113 ± 0.0020.652 ± 0.0320.0052 ± 19.1 10-50.0042 ± 0.00040.612 ± 0.054<0.99 150 g/liter0.109 ± 0.0120.118 ± 0.0120.119 ± 0.0100.627 ± 0.0240.0062 ± 0.00060.0031 ± 0.00120.610 ± 0.132<0.74 Open table in a new tab Our findings dictate that following the introduction of unfolded protein into a buffer favoring refolding, there must be at least one side reaction leading to the formation of some fraction of catalytically inactive protein. The following models thus represent possible molecular mechanisms that we have explored. They are listed in order of increasing complexity. Model I: Parallel Refolding—It is assumed that the unfolded protein U may either refold to the correct catalytically active conformation A, or one of a manifold of closely related compact and near-native conformations which are however catalytically inactive. The sum of all of non-active conformations can be grouped into a single inactive conformation I as shown in Reaction Scheme 1. U→A kAU→I klREACTION SCHEME 1 Solution of the rate equations described by this model leads to a simple analytical expression for the recovery curve (Equation 9), fA(t)=kAkA+kI[1−e−(kA+kI) t](Eq. 9) which is equivalent to the empirical model used to fit the data using Equation 7, with parameter substitutions given by Equations 10 and 11. f∞=kAkA+kI(Eq. 10) and tf=1kA+kI(Eq. 11) Model II: Parallel Refolding with Zinc Rebinding—This model is based upon the assumption that the zinc ion normally bound to native carbonic anhydrase (27Saito R. Sato T. Ikai A. Tanaka N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 792-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) dissociates upon exposure to 5 m GuHCl, and that rebinding of Zn2+ is a necessary prerequisite to reacquisition of catalytic activity shown in Reaction Scheme 2. U+Zn→A kAU→I klREACTION SCHEME 2 This model predicts that both the relaxation time for refolding and the long time limit of fractional activity regain would be highly dependent upon the concentration of free zinc in the refolding buffer. In control experiments, we changed the amount of free zinc in the refolding buffer by adding either a large excess of ZnCl2 or by adding a large excess of a zinc chelator (either histidine or dipicolinic acid). Neither modification of the experimental protocol resulted in a measurable change in activity regain kinetics, in qualitative agreement with results obtained in a prior study of the effect of zinc on carbonic anhydrase refolding (28Gudiksen K.L. Urbach A.R. Gitlin I. Yang J. Vazquez J.A. Costello C.E. Whitesides G.M. Anal. Chem. 2004; 76: 71Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar), demonstrating that this model need not be considered further. Model III: Two Kinetically Distinct Populations of Unfolded Conformations—Slow stages in refolding are usually associated with the isomerization of essential (protected) prolines. Carbonic anhydrase has 19 prolines (27Saito R. Sato T. Ikai A. Tanaka N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 792-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), 4 of them non-exposed to the solvent that could be, in principle, the ones determining the acquisition of the proper native state. A group of conformations containing rate-limiting non-native proline isomer(s) might be expected to refold significantly more slowly than those retaining the native-like proline isomer. The simplest model of this type follows: Let U1 contain native-like proline isomers and U2 contain non-native proline isomers (Reaction Scheme 3), U1→A kU1A↑ kU2U1U2→I kU21REACTION SCHEME 3 where kU2U1 is a measure of the (average) rate of proline isomerization and is expected to be much smaller than kU1A. The corresponding rate equations were solved numerically and used to model our data. We found that we could fit our data satisfactorily, but four adjustable parameters were required (3 rate constants plus the fractional abundance of U1 at zero time), which is two more than required in Model I, and the uncertainty of best-fit parameter determination was unacceptably great. If, in the future, the dead time between dilution of enzyme into refolding buffer and the initiation of data acquisition can be substantially reduced, data obtained at significantly shorter elapsed times may provide the increased resolution required to distinguish between this model and Model I, and to evaluate the additional parameters invoked in this model. Model IV: Inactivation via Aggregation—The following Reaction Scheme 4 is the simplest model of this type. U→A kAU+U→I klReaction Scheme 4 This model differs from Model I in that kI is a second-order rate constant instead of a first-order rate constant. Model IV predicts that the rate and extent of inactivation should increase substantially with increasing enzyme concentration, which conflicts with the results of control experiments described above, and hence was eliminated from further consideration. Model I was found to be the simplest model capable of accounting for our combined data quantitatively, and we adopt it as a provisional mechanistic description of refolding kinetics. We may solve Equations 10 and 11 simultaneously to calculate the rate constants kA and kI as functions of the empirical parameters f∞ and tf shown in Equations 12 and 13. kA=f∞tf(Eq. 12) kI=1−f∞tf(Eq. 13) In Fig. 6, we plot the estimated dependence of kA and kI upon the concentrations of sucrose and Ficoll, calculated using values of f∞ and tf obtained from the regression lines plotted in Fig. 4, A and B. According to the model, the highest concentrations of both sucrose and Ficoll result in a roughly 2-fold increase in kA, the highest concentration of sucrose results in a roughly 3-fold increase in kI, and the highest concentration of Ficoll results in a roughly 6-fold increase in kI. Why should Ficoll more strongly promote refolding to an inactive species than sucrose? We have no definite answer, but we do know that smaller volume excluding cosolutes are more sensitive to details of the conformation of a test macromolecule than larger volume excluding cosolutes, as they can probe the surface of the test molecule with higher resolution (3Hall D. Minton A.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1649: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Therefore we speculate that while both cosolutes enhance isomerizations that result in more compact conformations, in qualitative accord with the predictions of excluded volume theory (4Minton A.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 5Minton A.P. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 971-985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) the smaller cosolute may be more sensitive to small differences in excluded volume that might distinguish the globally most compact fully native (catalytically active) conformation from a large set of compact nearly native, but catalytically inactive, conformations. Prior studies of refolding have shown that crowding can contribute to a loss of enzymatic activity through enhancement of side reactions leading to aggregation (9van den Berg B. Ellis R. Dobson C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6927-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 29Zhou B.-R. Liang Y. Du F. Zhou Z. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55109-55116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The present study was carried out using concentrations of enzyme so low that significant aggregation did not take place on the time scale of our experiments. Thus we could demonstrate unambiguously that crowding can accelerate refolding of a monomeric protein not only to its native, enzymatically active conformation, but also to compact non-native conformations that are similar in overall structure but lacking enzymatic activity.

https://openalex.org/W2051468992,"Herpesvirus carriers transmit infection despite making virus-specific antibodies. Thus, their antibody responses are not necessarily optimal. An important question for infection control is whether vaccinating carriers might improve virus neutralization. The antibody response to murine gamma-herpesvirus-68 (MHV-68) blocks cell binding, but fails to block and even enhances an IgG Fc receptor-dependent infection of myeloid cells. Viral membrane fusion therefore remains intact. Although gH/gL-specific monoclonal antibodies can block infection at a post-binding step close to membrane fusion, gH/gL is a relatively minor antibody target in virus carriers. We show here that gH/gL-specific antibodies can block both Fc receptor-independent and Fc receptor-dependent infections, and that vaccinating virus carriers with a gH/gL fusion protein improves their capacity for virus neutralization both in vitro and in vivo. This approach has the potential to reduce herpesvirus transmission."
https://openalex.org/W1996047719,"Background The amino acid neurotransmitter GABA is abundant in the central nervous system (CNS) of both invertebrates and vertebrates. Receptors of this neurotransmitter play a key role in important processes such as learning and memory. Yet, little is known about the mode and tempo of evolution of the receptors of this neurotransmitter. Here, we investigate the phylogenetic relationships of GABA receptor subunits across the chordates and detail their mode of evolution among mammals. Principal Findings Our analyses support two major monophyletic clades: one clade containing GABAA receptor α, γ, and ε subunits, and another one containing GABAA receptor ρ, β, δ, θ, and π subunits. The presence of GABA receptor subunits from each of the major clades in the Ciona intestinalis genome suggests that these ancestral duplication events occurred before the divergence of urochordates. However, while gene divergence proceeded at similar rates on most receptor subunits, we show that the mammalian-specific subunits θ and ε experienced an episode of positive selection and of relaxed constraints, respectively, after the duplication event. Sites putatively under positive selection are placed on a three-dimensional model obtained by homology-modeling. Conclusions Our results suggest an early divergence of the GABA receptor subunits, before the split from urochordates. We show that functional changes occurred in the lineages leading to the mammalian-specific subunit θ, and we identify the amino acid sites putatively responsible for the functional divergence. We discuss potential consequences for the evolution of mammals and of their CNS."
https://openalex.org/W2006747257,"Extending the recent analysis of the safety of industrial bovine fat-derived products for human consumption (Müller, H., Stitz, L., and Riesner, D. (2006) Eur. J. Lip. Sci. Technol. 108, 812-826), we investigated systematically the effects of fat, fatty acids, and glycerol on the heat destruction of prions. Prion destruction was qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated in PrP 27-30, or prion rods, by the inactivation of infectivity as well as by the degradation of the polypeptide backbone. Under all conditions analyzed, inactivation of prion infectivity was achieved more efficiently than backbone degradation by several orders of magnitude. The presence of fat enhanced prion inactivation and offers a mild treatment for prion decontamination. In contrast, the presence of fat, fatty acids, and especially glycerol protected the PrP 27-30 backbone against heat-induced degradation. Glycerol also protected against heat-induced inactivation of prion infectivity. A phase distribution analysis demonstrated that prions migrated to the interphase of a fat/water mixture at room temperature and accumulated in the water phase at higher temperatures. In a systematic study of the mechanism of prion destruction, we found an intermediate structure of PrP that has fewer fibrils in β-sheet formation, lower resistance to protease digestion, greater aggregation, and reduced solubility compared with PrP 27-30 but retains residual infectivity. These findings suggest that prion infectivity depends on β-sheet-rich fibrillar structure and that inactivation proceeds in a stepwise manner, which explains the tailing effect frequently observed during inactivation. Extending the recent analysis of the safety of industrial bovine fat-derived products for human consumption (Müller, H., Stitz, L., and Riesner, D. (2006) Eur. J. Lip. Sci. Technol. 108, 812-826), we investigated systematically the effects of fat, fatty acids, and glycerol on the heat destruction of prions.

The prion diseases include bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), 3The abbreviations used are: BSE, bovine spongiform encephalopathy; PrP, prion protein; PK, proteinase K; ThT, thioflavin T; PrPC, cellular prion protein. 3The abbreviations used are: BSE, bovine spongiform encephalopathy; PrP, prion protein; PK, proteinase K; ThT, thioflavin T; PrPC, cellular prion protein. scrapie in goat and sheep, chronic wasting disease in deer and elk, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. These diseases can be acquired by transmission of an infectious agent, occur sporadically, or be inherited. In contrast, other fatal neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and Huntington disease are exclusively characterized by a sporadic or genetic etiology. The entity causing these diseases is called a prion, derived from “proteinaceous infectious particle” (2Prusiner S.B. Science. 1982; 216: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4096) Google Scholar). Prions are composed primarily, if not exclusively, of an abnormal isoform, denoted PrPSc, of the normal, cellular prion protein (PrPC), which is a hydrophobic glycoprotein expressed in all mammals studied to date. During disease pathogenesis, PrPC is converted into PrPSc with the assistance of one or more cofactors (3Prusiner S.B. Tremblay P. Safar J. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prion Biology and Diseases. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999Google Scholar, 4Cohen F.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 5Riesner, D. (2007) in Prions in Humans and Animals (Hörnlimann, B., Riesner, D., and Kretzschmar, H., eds) pp. 104-118, Walter de Gruyter, BerlinGoogle Scholar). Although the mechanism of conversion remains unclear, the “protein-only” hypothesis posits that PrPSc acts as template for the post-translational conversion of PrPC into PrPSc. The recent demonstration that infectious PrPSc fibrils can be formed solely from recombinant PrP offers strong support for the protein-only hypothesis (6Legname G. Baskakov I.V. Nguyen H.O. Riesner D. Cohen F.E. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Science. 2004; 305: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). The conformational transition of PrPC to PrPSc changes the physicochemical properties of the protein. PrPC is soluble in mild detergents, exhibits a mainly α-helical secondary structure, and is sensitive to degradation by proteases, e.g. proteinase K (PK). In contrast, PrPSc is partially PK-resistant and forms insoluble, β-sheet-rich multimeric aggregates that accumulate most prominently in the central nervous system. Upon purification using detergents and limited digestion by PK, the N terminus of PrPSc is truncated to yield a still infectious fragment of 27-30 kDa, designated PrP 27-30. As a result of hydrophobic interactions, PrP 27-30 forms rod-shaped fibrils, also called prion rods (7McKinley M.P. Meyer R.K. Kenaga L. Rahbar F. Cotter R. Serban A. Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1340-1351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Small amounts of two sphingolipids attach to PrP in prion rods (8Klein T.R. Kirsch D. Kaufmann R. Riesner D. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 655-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and 10% (w/w) of a polyglucose scaffold has been associated with PrP 27-30 (9Dumpitak C. Beekes M. Weinmann N. Metzger S. Winklhofer K.F. Tatzelt J. Riesner D. Biol. Chem. 2005; 386: 1149-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Prions are extraordinarily resistant to decontamination by physical or chemical procedures that inactivate conventional pathogens (10Taylor D.M. Contrib. Microbiol. 2004; 11: 136-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The unintentional application of inappropriate inactivation methods during rendering of offal to prepare meat and bone meal may have selected for the most resistant prions, which may have perpetuated the BSE epidemic in Europe as dairy cattle consumed this infected dietary supplement (11Wilesmith J.W. Ryan J.B.M. Atkinson M.J. Vet. Rec. 1991; 128: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 12Taylor, D. (1996) in Transmissible Subacute Spongiform Encephalopathies: Prion Diseases (Court, L., and Dodet, B., eds) pp. 479-482, Elsevier, ParisGoogle Scholar). Compelling evidence indicates that Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease can be transmitted by improperly decontaminated surgical equipment (13Brown P. Gibbs Jr., C.J. Rodgers-Johnson P. Asher D.M. Sulima M.P. Bacote A. Goldfarb L.G. Gajdusek D.C. Ann. Neurol. 1994; 5: 513-529Crossref Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Even though the chemical nature of prions is not fully characterized, effective methods for a significant reduction of prion infectivity titers have been described. Most widely used are treatments with 1 m sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or 2.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl). Partial inactivation can also be achieved by heat, i.e. steam autoclaving at 134 °C for 20 min. For complete inactivation, either steam autoclaving at ≥121 °C after treatment with 1 m NaOH or boiling in 1 m NaOH is required (10Taylor D.M. Contrib. Microbiol. 2004; 11: 136-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Many factors affect prion inactivation, including the prion strain, method of sample preparation (e.g. undiluted tissue, tissue homogenate, and tissue macerate (14Taylor D.M. Fernie K. McConnell I. Steele P.J. Vet. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)), the fixation and dehydration state of the agent (12Taylor, D. (1996) in Transmissible Subacute Spongiform Encephalopathies: Prion Diseases (Court, L., and Dodet, B., eds) pp. 479-482, Elsevier, ParisGoogle Scholar), and surface effects (smearing, particularly on steel surfaces (15Taylor D.M. J. Hosp. Infect. 1999; 43: 69-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar)). For instance, for 263K prions, a Syrian hamster-adapted scrapie strain, reductions of 3.2 log10 to 7.5 log10 (16Brown P. Liberski P.P. Wolff A. Gajdusek D.C. J. Infect. Dis. 1990; 161: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 17Taylor D.M. Fraser H. McConnell I. Brown D.A. Brown K.L. Lamza K.A. Smith G.R. Arch. Virol. 1994; 139: 313-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) in the ID50 have been reported for a 30-min incubation at 134 °C under comparable conditions. Prion inactivation is less efficient in brain tissue compared with brain homogenate, which was suggested to be due to fat molecules protecting against heat inactivation (10Taylor D.M. Contrib. Microbiol. 2004; 11: 136-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Indeed, lipid-mediated stabilization against heat treatment has been reported for bacteria (18Sendhaji A.F. J. Food Technol. 1977; 12: 216-230Google Scholar, 19Sendhaji A.F. Loncin M. J. Food Technol. 1977; 12: 203-216Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The presence of large amounts of external lipids also protects PrP 27-30 against heat degradation (20Appel T.R. Wolff M. von Rheinbaben F. Heinzel M. Riesner D. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), which is of particular importance because the fat content of mammalian tissues and particularly of brain is considerable. For example, greaves of ovine and porcine origin contain 19.5% fat, constituting a potent environment for the heat protection of PrP 27-30. The lipophilic character of prions and their tendency to form hydrophobic aggregates appear to be closely connected to their extraordinary stability. When prions are completely inactivated by autoclaving, destruction over time proceeds in an exponential fashion. However, when milder, partially inactivating conditions are applied, a tailing phenomenon is observed (15Taylor D.M. J. Hosp. Infect. 1999; 43: 69-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 21Rohwer R.G. Science. 1984; 223: 600-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 22Somerville R.A. Oberthür R.C. Havekost U. MacDonald F. Taylor D.M. Dickinson A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11084-11089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In this case, infectivity declines rapidly followed by slow inactivation with increasing treatment time. When conventional microorganisms present such a tailing inactivation, it reflects a protective effect of aggregation or population heterogeneity, i.e. a small subpopulation of more resistant particles (15Taylor D.M. J. Hosp. Infect. 1999; 43: 69-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In the case of prions, biphasic inactivation curves were explained by a heteromeric structure that enciphers informational and macromolecular components (23Taylor D.M. Vet. J. 2000; 159: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The intention of this study was to extend the analysis of oleochemical processes to a systematic understanding of interactions responsible for thermal prion destruction. A risk assessment calculation for all tallow-derived products was already provided (1Müller H. Stitz L. Riesner D. Eur. J. Lip. Sci. Technol. 2006; 108: 812-826Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar), confirming that industrial conditions for the basic oleochemical process of hydrolytic fat splitting constitute an effective means for reducing the risk of prion contamination to an acceptable minimum. To establish a mechanistic model for heat destruction of prions, we provide qualitative and quantitative data on the inactivation of infectivity as well as the degradation of the PrP 27-30 polypeptide backbone under continuous variation of conditions, particularly in the presence of different concentrations of fat, fatty acids, and glycerol. Prion Protein Samples—PrP 27-30 from Syrian hamsters infected with scrapie strain 263K was prepared as described earlier (24Prusiner S.B. McKinley M.P. Bowman K.A. Bolton D.C. Bendheim P.E. Groth F.D. Glenner G.G. Cell. 1983; 35: 349-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Centrifugation of a 50% sucrose gradient at 4 °C for 1 h at 100,000 × g in a TL45 rotor yielded the final PrP 27-30 pellet, which was stored at -70 °C until use. Bovine Edible Tallow, Oleic Acid, and Glycerol—Bovine edible tallow was provided by the European Oleochemicals and Allied Products Group. The fat had been recovered from adipose tissue and bones by dry melting at 100 °C followed by purification of the lipid fraction from tissues and proteinaceous matter by filtration through a diatomaceous earth bed. Remaining levels of moisture and total insoluble impurities were 0.11 and 0.018%, respectively. Because the most abundant natural fatty acids are those with 16 and 18 carbon atoms, pure oleic acid of 18 carbon atoms was used, kindly provided by Bernd Pokits and Martin Mittelbach (University of Graz, Graz, Austria). Glycerol of highest purity was purchased from Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany). Heat Treatment of Prions and Recovery from Mixtures Containing Fat, Fatty Acids, and Glycerol—As described in detail earlier (1Müller H. Stitz L. Riesner D. Eur. J. Lip. Sci. Technol. 2006; 108: 812-826Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 25Müller H. Riesner D. Eur. J. Lipid Sci. Technol. 2005; 107: 833-839Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), an inactivation system was utilized including a pressure reactor with external electric heating, digital pressure and temperature displays, and a magnetic stirrer (Parr Instruments Micro Bench Reactor 4591). PrP 27-30 was loaded into the reactor vessel containing 30-ml mixtures of raw materials (Table 1). Depending upon the reactor content, temperatures of up to 200 °C were reached within 47 min (Table 1). For the duration of the reaction, the reactor content was stirred at 150 rpm to permit an even temperature distribution within the reactor vessel as well as rapid heating and cooling.TABLE 1Summary of experimental set ups for testing the influence of heat on the stability of PrP 27–30 in the presence of water, fat, and glycerolExperimental setupABCDEFaIn the presence of glycerol, a relative content as low as 2.5% tallow did not influence the degradation and inactivation experiments.

Stitz L. Riesner D. Eur. J. Lip. Sci. Technol. 2006; 108: 812-826Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 25Müller H. Riesner D. Eur. J. Lipid Sci. Technol. 2005; 107: 833-839Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 26Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3163) Google Scholar). A minimum PrP recovery rate of 95% was achieved. Methanol/chloroform precipitation of PrP 27-30 subjected to 40 °C for 20 min did not decrease infectivity titers. Quantification of Heat-treated Prions by Immunoblotting and Incubation Time Interval Assay—After heat treatment, undegraded PrP was separated by PAGE (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). The amount of undegraded PrP was quantitatively detected by an improved immunoblot comprising staining with a mixture of the monoclonal antibodies 3F4 and R1, enhanced chemiluminescence, and densitometry as described earlier (1Müller H. Stitz L. Riesner D. Eur. J. Lip. Sci. Technol. 2006; 108: 812-826Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 25Müller H. Riesner D. Eur. J. Lipid Sci. Technol. 2005; 107: 833-839Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The sensitivity threshold of the method was 1 ng of PrP as determined by a dilution series of PrP 27-30. Bioassays of prion infectivity were performed by inoculation of weanling female Syrian gold hamsters (1Müller H. Stitz L. Riesner D. Eur. J. Lip. Sci. Technol. 2006; 108: 812-826Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Bioassays were terminated 390 days after inoculation. Prion titers were calculated by measuring the time intervals from inoculation to onset of clinical symptoms (2Prusiner S.B. Science. 1982; 216: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4096) Google Scholar). The dose-response curve from these titers was utilized for incubation times up to 140 days. For incubation times longer than 140 days, a bioassay detection limit of 2 log10 ID50 was used. For hamsters remaining healthy after 390 days, brain homogenates were prepared and subjected to PK digestion followed by Western blotting. Quantification of prion levels was performed as described (20Appel T.R. Wolff M. von Rheinbaben F. Heinzel M. Riesner D. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, the heat destruction of prions can be described by first-order decay kinetics with a rate constant k (20Appel T.R. Wolff M. von Rheinbaben F. Heinzel M. Riesner D. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 28Oberthür, R. C., Müller, H., and Riesner, D. (2007) in Prions in Humans and Animals (Hörnlimann, B., Riesner, D., and Kretzschmar, H., eds) pp. 515-525, Walter de Gruyter, BerlinGoogle Scholar). Therefore, the reduction factor RFt can be defined as the ratio between the concentration of PrP or prion infectivity, respectively, before and after heat treatment at a certain temperature for time t as shown in Equation 1, ln(CPrP(t)/CPrP(0))=−k×t(Eq. 1) or with the reduction factor after heating for 20 min as shown in Equation 2, log10RF20=k×1200/2.303(Eq. 2) The rate constant depends on the temperature according to the Arrhenius Equation 3, δ lnk/δ1/T=−EA/R(Eq. 3) where EA indicates the activation energy, and R is the gas constant. Combining both equations leads to a linear relationship of ln log10 RF20 as a function of 1/T. The mean values of all data points fall within the experimental error and are in accordance with the linear dependence (Fig. 1). Because the error limits of the Western blot densitometry were 10-15%, the majority of degradation experiments was repeated until reproducible. The mean standard error of all degradation data points in Fig. 1 was log10 0.24. Distribution of PrP 27-30 between Fat and Water Phases—Different amounts of PrP 27-30 were suspended in 15-ml polymer tubes containing 1:1 mixtures of bovine edible tallow and water preheated to a temperature of 40 °C. After agitation for 30 s, the specimens were incubated in a water bath at temperatures of 20, 40, 60, 80, or 100 °C until clear phases were achieved (usually for 30 min). The still-liquid fat phase was carefully separated using a needle attached to a glass syringe. Subsequently, the polymer tube was broached at the bottom, and the water phase was extracted. The protein in all three phases, i.e. fat, water, and remaining interphase of about 2.5-ml solution, was purified by methanol/chloroform precipitation as described above. The amount of PrP 27-30 in each phase was determined by Western blotting and densitometric quantification as described above. PK Assay—PK digestions were performed in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes or 96-well, black-bottom plates (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany). Specimens were incubated in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm EDTA with PK at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml at 37 °C for incubation times between 15 min and 60 h. The reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and boiling for 6 min. The degree of digestion was determined by real time fluorescence (thioflavin T assay) or by comparison with an undigested control on the same SDS gel (Western blotting). Determination of Solubility by Differential Centrifugation—According to the standards of Hjelmeland and Chrambach (29Hjelmeland L.M. Chrambach A. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 104: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), particles remaining in the supernatant after centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h are regarded as soluble. To test whether heat treatment affected solubility, PrP 27-30 was or was not subjected to temperatures of up to 125 °C for 20 min as described above. Solubilized PrP 27-30 was obtained by sonication with a Bandelin HD 2070 sonicator (Bandelin Electronic, Berlin, Germany) in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and 0.3% SDS. The specimens were sonicated 10 times at 15-s bursts at 65% power on ice followed by a 15-s cooling pause. Subsequent centrifugation in a TL-100 ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA) with a TLA-45 rotor for 1 h at 100,000 × g and 4 °C separated soluble PrP 27-30 from the insoluble pellet fraction. The amounts of PrP 27-30 in the supernatant and pellet fractions were determined by Western blotting and densitometric quantification as described above. Negative Staining and Electron Microscopy—Negative staining was performed as described previously (33Wille H. Zhang G.F. Baldwin M.A. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 608-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In brief, negative staining was done on Formvar/carbon-coated, 200-mesh copper grids (Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA), which were glow-discharged prior to staining. Five-μl samples were adsorbed for ∼30 s, and the grids were each washed with 50 μl of 0.1 and 0.01 m ammonium acetate (pH 7.4). Afterward, the grids were stained with 50 μl of freshly filtered stain, 2% ammonium molybdate. After drying, the samples were viewed in a FEI Tecnai F20 electron microscope (Eindhoven, The Netherlands) at 80 kV and a standard magnification of 25,000. Electron micrographs were recorded with a Gatan Ultrascan CCD camera. The magnification was calibrated using negatively stained catalase crystals and ferritin. Congo Red Birefringence—Protein solutions diluted to 150 μg/ml were air-dried on a glass microscope slide and incubated for 10 min in 0.5% Congo red, 80% ethanol. After successive washing with 90% ethanol and 96% ethanol, the specimens were viewed at ×400 magnification with a Zeiss III polarizing microscope. Thioflavin T (ThT) Assay—Thioflavin T binds specifically to amyloid fibrils such that its long axis is parallel to the long axis of the fibril, i.e. in neat rows running along the length of the β-sheets between the amino acid side chains, perpendicular to the strands (30Krebs M.R. Bromley E.H. Donald A.M. J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 149: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). In the absence of amyloid fibrils, ThT exhibits fluorescence at the excitation and emission maxima of 342 and 430 nm, respectively. Binding to PrP 27-30, however, results in new excitation and emission maxima of 442 and 482 nm, respectively. This change depends on the aggregated state of PrP (31LeVine H. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar, 32LeVine H. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). Because of the irregular arrangement of β-sheets within amorphous aggregates, the ThT assay is capable of discriminating between amorphous and fibrillar structures. To test for fibril formation, fluorescence measurements were performed in 96-well, black-bottom plates (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany) in a microplate reader Safire (Tecan Trading AG, Switzerland). All measurements were carried out at 37 °C in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 5 μm ThT. The recording parameters were as follows: excitation wavelength of 445 nm, emission range of 470-550 nm, step resolution of 2 nm, bandwidth of 2.5 nm, gain of 180, z-position of 4400 ± 400 μm. Kinetics were recorded for up to 240 cycles with intervals of 15 min. For analysis, the integral of the intensity measured from 470 to 550 nm was calculated. Circular Dichroism—CD spectra were recorded with a Jasco spectropolarimeter, model 715 (Jasco Inc.) and are depicted as ellipticity (θ). All measurements were performed at room temperature in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2) with or without addition of 10% glycerol. Ten spectra were recorded over the spectral range of 185-260 nm at a scan speed of 50 nm/min and a step resolution of 1 nm. Below a wavelength of 185 nm, excessive absorption by the buffer impeded further readings. The presence of glycerol limited the spectral range to wavelengths higher than 191 nm. A blank spectrum for cuvette and buffer was subtracted from each spectrum. Satisfactory CD spectra were only obtained with sonicated PrP 27-30 at a concentration of 1 μg/μl. Sonication was carried out with a Labsonic U cup sonicator (B. Braun Diessel Biotech) at 180 watts for 5 min at <25 °C. The specimens were contained in a screw-cap tube immersed 1 cm into the water bath of the sonicator. Thermostating of the sonication bath was established by a water cooling system. All experiments were carried out with prion rods purified from hamster brains infected with the hamster-adapted scrapie strain 263K. Heat treatment of prion samples was performed in a lab-scale autoclave appropriate for high pressure (1Müller H. Stitz L. Riesner D. Eur. J. Lip. Sci. Technol. 2006; 108: 812-826Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and analysis was accomplished by gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting as well as by bioassays in Syrian golden hamsters. Degradation of PrP 27-30—From the quantitative analysis of Western blots, reduction factors (RF20) for degradation, indicated by hydrolysis of the peptide bonds, of PrP 27-30 in different fat/water mixtures were determined after heat treatment for 20 min at temperatures up to 165 °C (Fig. 1A). No degradation experiments were conducted at temperatures >165 °C because unacceptably large amounts of PrP 27-30 would have been required. Comparing degradation experiments with and without tallow, the presence of fat increases the backbone stability of PrP 27-30 by 1 order of magnitude. However, in the presence of water, the protective effect of fat decreases with increasing temperature (Fig. 1A). At temperatures ≥110 °C, no significant difference was detected when degradation in 90% fat and 10% water was compared with that in pure water. Heat treatment in pure tallow in comparison with pure oleic acid did not exhibit significant differences over the whole temperature range. The slopes of the regression curves yield the activation energy of the degradation processes. The activation energy of heat-mediated degradation in the presence of fat or fatty acids was ∼31 (±4.4) kJ/mol, whereas in pure water, an activation energy of 20 (±5.3) kJ/mol was obtained. Compared with the presence of fat, the presence of glycerol resulted in greater stability of PrP 27-30 against heat degradation (Fig. 1B). The heat stability of PrP 27-30 in pure glycerol was raised by 2 orders of magnitude compared with that of PrP 27-30 in pure water. In contrast to fat, the presence of water in the mixtures did not affect the protective effect of glycerol; we found that 10% glycerol offered as much protection against degradation as 100% glycerol at high temperatures. The activation energies in 100 and 10% glycerol were 51 (±9.8) and 29 (±2.2) kJ/mol, respectively. The latter value should be considered with some care because the data suggest a biphasic degradation. At higher temperatures, in addition to the PrP triplet bands reflecting different levels of glycosylation, increased amounts of aggregate mixtures of higher molecular mass were noticed. Besides the formation of those large aggregates, signals at 60 kDa indicative of PrP dimers were detected as described earlier (20Appel T.R. Wolff M. von Rheinbaben F. Heinzel M. Riesner D. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 34Priola S.A. Caughey B. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3299-3305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Weak PrP-specific signals at 60 kDa were already present in untreated PrP 27-30 and particularly noticeable after heat treatment at medium temperatures. At further increased temperatures they disappeared in favor of aggregates of higher molecular mass. Higher amount"

We describe the performance of a custom resequencing microarray for mutational analysis of Congenital Myasthenic Syndromes (CMSs), a group of disorders in which the normal process of neuromuscular transmission is impaired.Our microarray was designed to assay the exons and flanking intronic regions of 8 genes linked to CMSs. A total of 31 microarrays were hybridized with genomic DNA from either individuals with known CMS mutations or from healthy controls. We estimated an overall microarray call rate of 93.61%, and we found the percentage agreement between the microarray and capillary sequencing techniques to be 99.95%. In addition, our microarray exhibited 100% specificity and 99.99% reproducibility. Finally, the microarray detected 22 out of the 23 known missense mutations, but it failed to detect all 7 known insertion and deletion (indels) mutations, indicating an overall sensitivity of 73.33% and a sensitivity with respect to missense mutations of 95.65%.Overall, our microarray prototype exhibited strong performance and proved highly efficient for screening genes associated with CMSs. Until indels can be efficiently assayed with this technology, however, we recommend using resequencing microarrays for screening CMS mutations after common indels have been first assayed by capillary sequencing."
https://openalex.org/W1965364812,"The HPr kinase/phosphorylase (HPrK/P) is a bifunctional enzyme that controls the phosphorylation state of the phospho-carrier protein HPr, which regulates the utilization of carbon sources in Gram-positive bacteria. It uses ATP or pyrophosphate for the phosphorylation of serine 46 of HPr and inorganic phosphate for the dephosphorylation of Ser(P)-46-HPr via a phosphorolysis reaction. HPrK/P is a hexameric protein kinase of a new type with a catalytic core belonging to the family of nucleotide-binding protein with Walker A motif. It exhibits no structural similarity to eukaryotic protein kinases. So far, HPrK/P structures have shown the enzyme in its phosphorylase conformation. They permitted a detailed characterization of the phosphorolysis mechanism. In the absence of a structure with bound nucleotide, we used the V267F mutant enzyme to assess the kinase conformation. Indeed, the V267F replacement was found to cause an almost entire loss of the phosphorylase activity of Lactobacillus casei HPrK/P. In contrast, the kinase activity remained conserved. To elucidate the structural alterations leading to this drastic change of activity, the x-ray structure of the catalytic domain of L. casei HPrK/P-V267F was determined at 2.6Å resolution. A comparison with the structure of the wild type enzyme showed that the mutation induces conformation changes compatible with the switch from phosphorylase to kinase function.

A comparison with the structure of the wild type enzyme showed that the mutation induces conformation changes compatible with the switch from phosphorylase to kinase function. Together with nucleotide binding fluorescence measurements, these results allowed us to decipher the cooperative behavior of the protein and to gain new insights into the allosteric regulation mechanism of HPrK/P. In Gram-positive bacteria, HPr kinase/phosphorylase (HPrK/P) 6The abbreviations used are: HPrK/P, HPr kinase/phosphorylase; FBP, fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate; PPi, pyrophosphate; P-loop, phosphate binding loop; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; r.m.s.d, root mean square deviation; MantADP, 2′-/3′-O-(N′-methylanthraniloyl) ADP. is the central regulator of carbon catabolite repression, the paradigm of signal transduction (1MartinVerstraete I. Deutscher J. Galinier A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2966-2969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In response to certain metabolites that change their concentration in the presence of rapidly metabolizable carbon sources, HPrK/P either phosphorylates or dephosphorylates Ser-46 of the histidine-containing protein HPr. In Gram-positive bacteria, Ser(P)-46-HPr functions as co-repressor for carbon catabolite repression by interacting with the transcriptional regulator CcpA (catabolite control protein A) that regulates the expression of many genes (2Fujita Y. Miwa Y. Galinier A. Deutscher J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 3Jones B.E. Dossonnet V. Küster E. Hillen W. Deutscher J. Klevit R.E. J. Biol.

Rev. 2006; 70: 939-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). In the Gram-negative Neisseria meningitidis devoid of CcpA-mediated carbon catabolite repression, Ser(P)-46-HPr is involved in the cell adhesion process (5Boël G. Mijakovic I. Maze A. Poncet S. Taha M.K. Larribe M. Darbon E. Khemiri A. Galinier A. Deutscher J. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2003; 5: 206-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), suggesting that HPrK/P might constitute a potential target for new antimicrobial agents in pathogenic bacteria. Finally, the formation of Ser(P)-46-HPr inhibits PrfA, a transcription activator of several virulence genes in Listeria monocytogenes (6Herro R. Poncet S. Cossart P. Buchrieser C. Gouin E. Glaser P. Deutscher J. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2005; 9: 224-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). HPrK/P was first identified as a serine protein kinase, and this activity is enhanced in the presence of glycolytic intermediates such as fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate (FBP) and inhibited in the presence of inorganic phosphate (Pi) (7Deutscher J. Saier Jr., M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6790-6794Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of Ser(P)-46-HPr by HPrK/P was assumed to be hydrolytic. However, Pi was also reported to stimulate the HPrK/P-catalyzed dephosphorylation of Ser(P)-46-HPr, which was surprising as Pi was expected to be the product of the phosphatase reaction. In fact, Ser(P)-46-HPr dephosphorylation turned out to follow an unusual mechanism. Pi functions as substrate and carries out a nucleophilic attack on the phosphorous atom of Ser(P)-46-HPr, thus leading to the formation of pyrophosphate (PPi) and HPr. Ser(P)-46-HPr dephosphorylation is therefore a phosphorolysis and not a hydrolysis reaction (8Mijakovic I. Poncet S. Galinier A. Monedero V. Fieulaine S. Janin J. Nessler S. Marquez J.A. Scheffzek K. Hasenbein S. Hengstenberg W. Deutscher J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13442-13447Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Actually, it is the reversal of the PPi-dependent HPr phosphorylation. In vitro, the HPrK/P kinase activity accepts both ATP and PPi as phosphate donor. However, only the ATP-dependent kinase activity is stimulated by FBP. The crystal structures of HPrK/P of L. casei (9Fieulaine S. Morera S. Poncet S. Monedero V. Gueguen-Chaignon V. Galinier A.

Hillen W. Stülke J. Brennan R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 1203-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) showed similar tertiary and quaternary structures (12Nessler S. Fieulaine S. Poncet S. Galinier A. Deutscher J. Janin J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4003-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). HPrK/P is a homohexamer with subunits of ∼300 residues folding in two distinct structural domains. The C-terminal domain carries both kinase and phosphorylase activities, whereas the N-terminal domain has no defined function yet. The C-terminal domain contains a Walker A motif forming the phosphate binding loop (P-loop) of the nucleotide-binding site. The HPrK/P fold is therefore different from that of eukaryotic protein kinases but resembles small molecule kinases from the P-loop-containing protein family (13Russell R.B. Marquez J.A. Hengstenberg W. Scheffzek K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, HPrK/P represents the first member of a novel family of protein kinases (14Galinier A.

The structure of the complex between the L. casei HPrK/P C-terminal domain (ΔHPrK/P) and its protein substrate Ser(P)-46-HPr (15Fieulaine S. Morera S. Poncet S. Mijakovic I. Galinier A. Janin J. Deutscher J. Nessler S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13437-13441Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) allowed us to describe the catalytic mechanism of the phosphorylase reaction. The structure of the complex between L. casei ΔHPrK/P and the protein substrate of the ATP-dependent kinase activity, unphosphorylated HPr, was similar and has been obtained in the absence of a nucleotide (15Fieulaine S. Morera S. Poncet S. Mijakovic I. Galinier A. Janin J. Deutscher J. Nessler S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13437-13441Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These two complexes adopt the phosphorylase conformation and prevent a modeling of ATP in the conserved nucleotide-binding site. They resemble the uncomplexed HPrK/P hexamer in which a conserved region called the central loop (residues 265–275) of a subunit clashes with the base moiety of ATP modeled into the P-loop of an adjacent subunit (9Fieulaine S. Morera S. Poncet S. Monedero V. Gueguen-Chaignon V. Galinier A. Janin J. Deutscher J. Nessler S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3917-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Kinetic measurements of ATP-dependent HPr phosphorylation provided sigmoid curves and therefore suggested that ATP binds to Bacillus subtilis HPrK/P with strong positive cooperativity (16Jault J.M. Fieulaine S. Nessler S. Gonzalo P. Di Pietro A. Deutscher J. Galinier A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1773-1780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This result was confirmed by fluorescence studies using the unique tryptophan of B. subtilis HPrK/P in either intrinsic fluorescence measurements or fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments with the fluorescent nucleotide analogue MantADP (2′-/3′-O-(N′-methylanthraniloyl) ADP (16Jault J.M.

Quenching of the tryptophan fluorescence by iodide further suggested that HPrK/P exists in two conformations. ATP binding, but not PPi binding, modifies the fluorescence properties of the unique tryptophan of the enzyme, indicating that the conformational change is induced by the binding of the base and sugar moieties of the nucleotide outside of the P-loop (17Pompeo F. Granet Y. Lavergne J.P. Grangeasse C. Nessler S. Jault J.M. Galinier A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6762-6771Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Positive cooperativity was also reported for FBP (16Jault J.M. Fieulaine S. Nessler S. Gonzalo P. Di Pietro A. Deutscher J. Galinier A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1773-1780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The binding site of this effector is still unknown, but mutant studies (17Pompeo F. Granet Y.

Biochem. 2006; 70: 1089-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) suggest that it might bind in the capping motif (residues 197–222) corresponding to the signature sequence of HPrK/P (9Fieulaine S. Morera S. Poncet S. Monedero V. Gueguen-Chaignon V. Galinier A. Janin J. Deutscher J. Nessler S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3917-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Addition of FBP does not increase the affinity of the enzyme for ATP and rather stimulates the kinase activity at low ATP concentrations (16Jault J.M. Fieulaine S. Nessler S. Gonzalo P. Di Pietro A. Deutscher J. Galinier A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1773-1780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). FBP binding is supposed to stabilize the kinase conformation (17Pompeo F. Granet Y. Lavergne J.P. Grangeasse C. Nessler S. Jault J.M. Galinier A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6762-6771Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) that still needs to be determined. Despite numerous co-crystallization or soaking attempts using ATP analogues, we were unable to obtain HPrK/P in complex with a nucleotide. Random mutagenesis experiments permitted isolation of L. casei HPrK alleles encoding mutant HPrK/Ps exhibiting low phosphorylase but normal kinase activity (19Monedero V. Poncet S. Mijakovic I. Fieulaine S. Dossonnet V. Martin-Verstraete I. Nessler S. Deutscher J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3928-3937Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The mutations exclusively affected the P-loop and the central loop. The lowest phosphorylase activity was observed for the V267F mutation in the central loop, which led to a similar effect when introduced into B. subtilis HPrK/P (19Monedero V. Poncet S. Mijakovic I. Fieulaine S. Dossonnet V. Martin-Verstraete I. Nessler S. Deutscher J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3928-3937Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the crystal structure of the V267F mutant of L. casei ΔHPrK/P at 2.6 Å resolution. The conformation changes caused by the V267F replacement allowed the modeling of ATP into the active site. Furthermore, fluorescence experiments aimed at studying the ATP binding mode of the mutant protein allowed us to gain insights into the allosteric behavior of the enzyme. Protein Expression and Purification—A L. casei hprK allele encoding amino acid residues 128–319 (20Dossonnet V. Monedero V. Zagorec M. Galinier A. Perez-Martinez G. Deutscher J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2582-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and carrying the V267F mutation (19Monedero V. Poncet S. Mijakovic I. Fieulaine S. Dossonnet V. Martin-Verstraete I. Nessler S. Deutscher J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3928-3937Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) was cloned into the pQE30 plasmid as described for the corresponding wild type gene (9Fieulaine S. Morera S. Poncet S. Monedero V. Gueguen-Chaignon V. Galinier A. Janin J. Deutscher J. Nessler S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3917-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The resulting protein (ΔHPrK/P-V267F) carries an N-terminal histidine tag. The plasmid was used to transform Escherichia coli M15, and transformants were grown in 2TY medium at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.8. The synthesis of ΔHPrK/P-V267F was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 6000 × g and resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mm Na/Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl). After sonication and centrifugation for 30 min at 25,000 × g, the clarified lysate was applied to a Fast-Flow nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen). ΔHPrK/P-V267F was eluted with 25 mm Na/Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 300 mm imidazole, applied onto a Superdex 200 HL 16/60 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare), and eluted with 25 mm Na/Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl. The R245A hprK allele was obtained by PCR by using appropriate mutagenic oligonucleotides, and the presence of the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The R245A hprK allele was cloned into pQE30 by using the same enzymes as for the wild type and the V267F hprK alleles. The His-tagged protein ΔHPrK/P-R245A was synthesized in E. coli NM522 and purified by following the procedure described above. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination—Crystals were grown in hanging drops containing 150 μm ΔHPrK/P-V267F, 10% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD), 0.1 m sodium acetate, and 0.05 m sodium citrate, pH 5.4, over pits containing 20% (v/v) MPD, 0.2 m sodium acetate, 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.4. Cryoprotection was achieved by soaking the crystals in a mother solution containing 25% (v/v) MPD prior to flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K to 2.6 Å resolution on an ADSC Quantum Q4R CCD detector from a single crystal on beamline ID14-H1 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). Data processing was performed using MOSFLM (21Powell H.R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Four trimers forming two hexameric biological units compose the asymmetric unit. Model refinement was performed using REFMAC (24Murshudov G. Vagin A. Dodson E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Fluorescence measurements were carried out after appropriate dilution of ΔHPrK/P and equilibration for 10 min in 800 μl of a buffer containing 25 mm Na/Hepes, pH 8.2, 100 mm NaCl. Increasing concentrations of ADP, MantADP, or FBP were added such that the total volume of the sample was not significantly increased. Binding was monitored by the variation of protein intrinsic fluorescence, MantADP extrinsic fluorescence, or FRET. In the nucleotide binding experiments, equimolar nucleotide and magnesium concentrations were used. All spectra were corrected for buffer and/or protein fluorescence. The intrinsic fluorescence resulting from the single tryptophan residue (Trp-237) of a 1-μm L. casei ΔHPrK/P sample was measured at λexc = 295 nm and λem = 350 nm at 600 V with a 5 nm band pass. The inner filter effect due to nonspecific quenching of tryptophan fluorescence at high ligand concentrations was determined in control experiments with N-acetyl-tryptophanamide (NATA) (Sigma) and subtracted. MantADP extrinsic fluorescence measurements were performed in the presence of 30 μm ΔHPrK/P at λexc = 350 nm and λem = 440 nm at 600 V with a 2.5 nm band pass. FRET measurements between Trp-237 and MantADP-Mg were performed with 15 μm ΔHPrK/P at λexc = 295 nm and λem = 440 nm at 600 V with a 5 nm band pass. For both FRET and MantADP experiments, the fluorescence of equivalent amounts of free MantADP in the absence of ΔHPrK/P was recorded under the same conditions, and the linear regression coefficient of the corresponding curve was used for correction of the binding data (27Matyus L. Szollosi J. Jenei A. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 2006; 83: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Dissociation constants were calculated using in-house software. After background correction, the concentration dependence of fluorescence intensity was fitted either to a sigmoidal (Fsig) (28Hill A.V. J. Physiol. 1910; 40: 4-7Google Scholar) or a hyperbolic (Fhyp) (29Rodier F.J. Ilgenfritz G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 128: 451-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) function following the equations Fsig = Fmax*[S]n/(KDn + [S]n) or Fhyp = 0.5*γ*(n [E] + [S] + KD - √((n*[E] + [S] + KD)2 - 4*n*[E]*[S]), where F is the relative intensity, [E] is the concentration of ΔHPrK/P, [S]isthe concentration of nucleotide, n is the number of binding sites/molecule of protein, γ is the relative quantum yield coefficient, and KD is the equilibrium dissociation constant. [E] and [S] were kept constant during the fitting procedure. Mutant R245A Activity Measurements—Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions was used to follow B. subtilis HPr phosphorylation and Ser(P)-46-HPr dephosphorylation, because under these conditions the two HPr forms migrate to different positions (30Deutscher J. Engelmann R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1984; 23: 157-162Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). 67 μg/ml HPr or Ser(P)-46-HPr were mixed with 6.7 or 83 μg/ml HPrK/P in a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, and either 5 mm ATP or PPi for the phosphorylation or 5 mm Pi for the dephosphorylation experiments. The assay mixture was incubated for 25 min at 37 °C, and ΔHPrK/P was inactivated by keeping the solution for 5 min at 70 °C prior to separation on a 12.5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Structure of L. casei ΔHPrK/P-V267F and Comparison with the Wild Type Enzyme—As for the wild type enzyme, ΔHPrK/P-V267F forms a hexamer composed of two trimers (9Fieulaine S. Morera S. Poncet S. Monedero V. Gueguen-Chaignon V. Galinier A. Janin J. Deutscher J. Nessler S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3917-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The two hexamers present in the unit cell are equivalent with an r.m.s.d. of 0.5 Å for 980 residues excluding the region 236–250 and the C-terminal helix. The fold of the core of the twelve subunits is globally conserved with an r.m.s.d. of 0.49–0.9 Å over 140 Cα atoms. Two subunits per hexamer are fully defined in the electron density map, except for a few residues at the N- and C-terminal extremities of the polypeptide chain. In the other subunits, an additional region is missing in the flexible loop. Due to the absence of bound phosphate, the electron density corresponding to the P-loop is poorly defined (11Allen G.S. Steinhauer K. Hillen W. Stülke J. Brennan R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 1203-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The C-terminal helix that has already been reported to move upon HPr binding and crystal packing constraints (12Nessler S. Fieulaine S. Poncet S. Galinier A. Deutscher J. Janin J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4003-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) adopts various positions within a range of 15 Å. The V267F mutation has little effect on the subunit fold. When compared with the wild type enzyme, the average r.m.s.d. value for 140 Cα atoms is 1.2 Å. In contrast, it imposes an important conformation change on the quaternary structure leading to a compact hexamer with a global r.m.s.d. of 2.7 Å for 980 Cα positions (excluding the region 236–250 and the C-terminal helix). Each trimer rotates along the 3-fold axis by ∼7° toward the other trimer, thereby increasing the dimer interface by ∼400 Å2/monomer (Fig. 1A). The trimer interface is unchanged, covering 2000 Å2/subunit. However, the central loops of the trimer undergo an important rearrangement (Fig. 1B). Loss of Phosphorylase Activity—Superimposition of two subunits of L. casei ΔHPrK/P in complex with Ser(P)-46-HPr (PDB code 1KKM) (15Fieulaine S. Morera S. Poncet S. Mijakovic I. Galinier A. Janin J. Deutscher J. Nessler S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13437-13441Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and two equivalently arranged subunits from the V267F mutant HPrK/P shows that the conformation change induced by the mutation leads toa3Å shift of Arg-245 away from the phosphoseryl residue Ser(P)-46 of HPr (Fig. 2). The loss of the Arg-245-Ser(P)-46 interaction that was proposed to be important for phosphorolysis (15Fieulaine S. Morera S. Poncet S. Mijakovic I. Galinier A. Janin J. Deutscher J. Nessler S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13437-13441Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) could be responsible for the almost entire loss of phosphorylase activity observed for HPrK/P-V267F (31Monedero V. Kuipers O.P. Jamet E. Deutscher J. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3391-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To verify the importance of Arg-245, we purified the ΔHPrK/P-R245A mutant. Ser(P)-46-HPr dephosphorylation experiments followed by separation of the reaction products on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels revealed that ΔHPrK/P-R245A had lost the phosphorylase function (Fig. 3A). In fact, no Ser(P)-46-HPr dephosphorylation could be detected in a pH range from 6.8 to 8.8 (data not shown). This result confirmed the catalytic role of Arg-245 in the phosphorylase reaction. In addition, HPr phosphorylation experiments showed that the R245A replacement causes a loss of PPi-dependent kinase activity (Fig. 3B) under conditions where the wild type enzyme completely phosphorylates HPr (data not shown). In contrast, the ATP-dependent kinase activity is not altered by the R245A mutation (Fig. 3B). Nucleotide Binding Analysis—We superimposed each subunit of ΔHPrK/P-V267F with the nucleotide-binding domain of the ATP-bound PEP carboxykinase (PDB code 1AYL) (32Tari L.W. Matte A. Pugazhenthi U. Goldie H. Delbaere L.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the closest structural homologue of HPrK/P (14Galinier A. Lavergne J.P. Geourjon C. Fieulaine S. Nessler S. Jault J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11362-11367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Contrary to the situation described for wild type L. casei ΔHPrK/P (9Fieulaine S. Morera S. Poncet S. Monedero V. Gueguen-Chaignon V. Galinier A. Janin J. Deutscher J. Nessler S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3917-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), the conformation changes observed with the ΔHPrK/P-V267F mutant allowed us to directly model bound ATP without any clashes between the base part of the nucleotide and the central loop of the enzyme (Fig. 4). We used fluorescence measurements to test whether the V267F mutation would alter the affinity of the enzyme for the nucleotide. Using the unique tryptophan (Trp-237) situated at the N-terminal extremity of the flexible loop (residues 236–258), we carried out FRET experiments with the fluorescent analogue MantADP. Both L. casei wild type and V267F mutant ΔHPrK/P exhibit similar sigmoidal binding curves (Fig. 5A) with respective KD values of 31 and 30 μm, which is close to the dissociation constant of 17 μm determined with the full-length B. subtilis enzyme (16Jault J.M. Fieulaine S. Nessler S. Gonzalo P. Di Pietro A. Deutscher J. Galinier A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1773-1780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These results demonstrated that the truncated form of L. casei ΔHPrK/P exhibits a cooperative ATP binding behavior similar to that of the full-length B. subtilis enzyme. They further suggested that the conformation change induced by the V267F mutation does not modify the affinity of the enzyme for the nucleotide. We then investigated the exact significance of the sigmoidal response observed in the FRET experiments and in the phosphorylation assays (17Pompeo F. Granet Y. Lavergne J.P. Grangeasse C. Nessler S. Jault J.M. Galinier A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6762-6771Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and ADP-Mg, we again obtained similar sigmoidal binding curves with both the wild type enzyme and the V267F mutant protein (data not shown). However, when extrinsic fluorescence of MantADP-Mg was used to follow nucleotide binding to L. casei ΔHPrK/P, the cooperative behavior was lost (Fig. 5B). This result clearly demonstrated that the sigmoidal character of the saturation curve reflected changes in the tryptophan environment. This experiment further revealed a 30-fold increased affinity of ΔHPrK/P-V267F for MantADP-Mg compared with the wild type enzyme, with a KD value decreasing from 10 to 0.3 μm. The effect of FBP on the cooperative transition observed in the Trp-237/MantADP-Mg FRET experiments was also investigated. No effect was observed upon addition of 2 mm FBP with either L. casei wild type ΔHPrK/P or the V267F mutant protein (data not shown), suggesting that the conformation of the flexible loop is not affected by FBP binding. So far, the wild type HPrK/Ps always adopted the phosphorylase conformation in the numerous known structures. This observation is explained by the absence of nucleotide in these structures. The structure of the L. casei ΔHPrK/P-V267F mutant protein presented here revealed that a global rearrangement of the ΔHPrK/P subunits accompanies the mutation, as expected from modeling of the V267F replacement. Indeed, the phenylalanine ring generated steric clashes when introduced in the wild type HPrK/P structure (data not shown). The quaternary structure rearrangement in the mutant enzyme allows the modeling of the base moiety of bound ATP, which was sterically hindered in the wild type protein. The mutant conformation is therefore compatible with the ATP-dependent activity of the enzyme. Our fluorescence analysis demonstrated that this quaternary structure change induces an increased affinity of the protein for the nucleotide. On the other hand, the cooperative behavior of the protein is not affected by the mutation. The sigmoidal shape of the saturation curve therefore reflects a rearrangement of the Trp-237 environment induced upon nucleotide binding. In agreement with the almost entire loss of phosphorylase activity (19Monedero V. Poncet S. Mijakovic I. Fieulaine S. Dossonnet V. Martin-Verstraete I. Nessler S. Deutscher J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3928-3937Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we thus propose that the quaternary structure of L. casei ΔHPrK/P-V267F corresponds to the kinase conformation. According to this hypothesis, ATP binding induces a rearrangement of the central loop similar to that observed in the mutant. We also propose that ATP binding induces a rearrangement of the flexible loop carrying residue Arg-245 that we have shown to be directly involved in catalysis of phosphorolysis. This loop is disordered in the absence of a ligand but adopts a stable conformation in the presence of Ser(P)-46-HPr (15Fieulaine S. Morera S. Poncet S. Mijakovic I. Galinier A. Janin J. Deutscher J. Nessler S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13437-13441Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The finding that Arg-245 is involved in the PPi-dependent phosphorylation mechanism suggests that this reaction requires the same HPrK/P conformation as the reverse reaction, i.e. the phosphorylase conformation. It also explains why Ser(P)-46-HPr cannot be dephosphorylated with ADP. The base moiety of ADP probably stabilizes the kinase conformation, preventing the Arg-245-phosphoserine interaction. The kinase conformation of the flexible loop, which might be stabilized by hydrophobic interactions between the base moiety of ATP and tryptophan Trp-237, seems to be implicated in catalysis of the ATP-dependent HPr phosphorylation rather than in nucleotide binding itself. In contrast to most allosteric bifunctional proteins, such as aspartokinase I/homoserine dehydrogenase I (33Jullien M. Baudet S. Rodier F. Le Bras G. Biochimie (Paris). 1988; 70: 1807-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2, 6-bisphosphatase (34Yang Q.H. Zhu Z. Dong M.Q. Ling S. Wu C.L. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24608-24613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), or ATP sulfurylase/APS kinase (35Yu Z. Lansdon E.B. Segel I.H. Fisher A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 732-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) that possess two distinct active sites, both activities of HPrK/P are catalyzed by two conformations of the same active site. The two conformations of HPrK/P are probably in an ATP-regulated equilibrium where the absence of ATP favors the phosphorylase conformation and its presence the kinase conformation. This concept therefore corresponds to the equilibrium shift activation described for example for E. coli CheY (36Dyer C.M. Dahlquist F.W. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 7354-7363Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Applying this model to HPrK/P implies that the shift toward the kinase conformation is induced by the rearrangement of the central loops upon binding of the base moiety of ATP. The central loops are so close to each other that the rearrangement propagates from one subunit to the other in a global quaternary structure change where all HPrK/P subunits must exist in the same conformation. This corresponds to the symmetry model (or MWC model) of allostery (37Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6178) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the rearrangement of the flexible loop may occur in a sequential way depending on the binding of each molecule of ATP, following the induced fit model of allostery where ligand binding and conformation switching are concomitant (38Koshland Jr., D.E. Nemethy G. Filmer D. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 365-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar). This concerted collective motion associated to sequential local structural changes is certainly a more coherent mechanistic picture of the transition process, reconciling the induced fit and the population shift models for protein allostery by emphasizing the kinetic and thermodynamic aspects of allosteric transition (26Formaneck M.S. Ma L. Cui Q. Proteins. 2006; 63: 846-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).
