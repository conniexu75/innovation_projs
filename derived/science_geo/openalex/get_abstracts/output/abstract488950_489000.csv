https://openalex.org/W2075873658,"Background In advanced cancers, transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) promotes tumor growth and metastases and suppresses host antitumor immunity. GC1008 is a human anti-TGFβ monoclonal antibody that neutralizes all isoforms of TGFβ. Here, the safety and activity of GC1008 was evaluated in patients with advanced malignant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. Methods In this multi-center phase I trial, cohorts of patients with previously treated malignant melanoma or renal cell carcinoma received intravenous GC1008 at 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, or 15 mg/kg on days 0, 28, 42, and 56. Patients achieving at least stable disease were eligible to receive Extended Treatment consisting of 4 doses of GC1008 every 2 weeks for up to 2 additional courses. Pharmacokinetic and exploratory biomarker assessments were performed. Results Twenty-nine patients, 28 with malignant melanoma and 1 with renal cell carcinoma, were enrolled and treated, 22 in the dose-escalation part and 7 in a safety cohort expansion. No dose-limiting toxicity was observed, and the maximum dose, 15 mg/kg, was determined to be safe. The development of reversible cutaneous keratoacanthomas/squamous-cell carcinomas (4 patients) and hyperkeratosis was the major adverse event observed. One malignant melanoma patient achieved a partial response, and six had stable disease with a median progression-free survival of 24 weeks for these 7 patients (range, 16.4–44.4 weeks). Conclusions GC1008 had no dose-limiting toxicity up to 15 mg/kg. In patients with advanced malignant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma, multiple doses of GC1008 demonstrated acceptable safety and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity, warranting further studies of single agent and combination treatments.

https://openalex.org/W2106641523,"HOTAIR is a long non-coding RNA that interacts with the polycomb repressive complex and suppresses its target genes. HOTAIR has also been demonstrated to promote malignancy. MicroRNA-141 (miR-141) has been reported to play a role in the epithelial to mesenchymal transition process, and the expression of miR-141 is inversely correlated with tumorigenicity and invasiveness in several human cancers. We found that HOTAIR expression is inversely correlated to miR-141 expression in renal carcinoma cells. HOTAIR promotes malignancy, including proliferation and invasion, whereas miR-141 suppresses malignancy in human cancer cells. miR-141 binds to HOTAIR in a sequence-specific manner and suppresses HOTAIR expression and functions, including proliferation and invasion. Both HOTAIR and miR-141 were associated with the immunoprecipitated Ago2 (Argonaute2) complex, and the Ago2 complex cleaved HOTAIR in the presence of miR-141. These results demonstrate that HOTAIR is suppressed by miR-141 in an Ago2-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2055220027,"Using Roche/454 technology, we sequenced the chloroplast genomes of 12 Triticeae species, including bread wheat, barley and rye, as well as the diploid progenitors and relatives of bread wheat Triticum urartu, Aegilops speltoides and Ae. tauschii. Two wild tetraploid taxa, Ae. cylindrica and Ae. geniculata, were also included. Additionally, we incorporated wild Einkorn wheat Triticum boeoticum and its domesticated form T. monococcum and two Hordeum spontaneum (wild barley) genotypes. Chloroplast genomes were used for overall sequence comparison, phylogenetic analysis and dating of divergence times. We estimate that barley diverged from rye and wheat approximately 8–9 million years ago (MYA). The genome donors of hexaploid wheat diverged between 2.1–2.9 MYA, while rye diverged from Triticum aestivum approximately 3–4 MYA, more recently than previously estimated. Interestingly, the A genome taxa T. boeoticum and T. urartu were estimated to have diverged approximately 570,000 years ago. As these two have a reproductive barrier, the divergence time estimate also provides an upper limit for the time required for the formation of a species boundary between the two. Furthermore, we conclusively show that the chloroplast genome of hexaploid wheat was contributed by the B genome donor and that this unknown species diverged from Ae. speltoides about 980,000 years ago. Additionally, sequence alignments identified a translocation of a chloroplast segment to the nuclear genome which is specific to the rye/wheat lineage. We propose the presented phylogeny and divergence time estimates as a reference framework for future studies on Triticeae."
https://openalex.org/W2093901546,"N(6)-Methylation of adenosine is the most ubiquitous and abundant modification of nucleoside in eukaryotic mRNA and long non-coding RNA. This modification plays an essential role in the regulation of mRNA translation and RNA metabolism. Recently, human AlkB homolog 5 (Alkbh5) and fat mass- and obesity-associated protein (FTO) were shown to erase this methyl modification on mRNA. Here, we report five high resolution crystal structures of the catalytic core of Alkbh5 in complex with different ligands. Compared with other AlkB proteins, Alkbh5 displays several unique structural features on top of the conserved double-stranded β-helix fold typical of this protein family. Among the unique features, a distinct ""lid"" region of Alkbh5 plays a vital role in substrate recognition and catalysis. An unexpected disulfide bond between Cys-230 and Cys-267 is crucial for the selective binding of Alkbh5 to single-stranded RNA/DNA by bringing a ""flipping"" motif toward the central β-helix fold. We generated a substrate binding model of Alkbh5 based on a demethylation activity assay of several structure-guided site-directed mutants. Crystallographic and biochemical studies using various analogs of α-ketoglutarate revealed that the active site cavity of Alkbh5 is much smaller than that of FTO and preferentially binds small molecule inhibitors. Taken together, our findings provide a structural basis for understanding the substrate recognition specificity of Alkbh5 and offer a foundation for selective drug design against AlkB members."
https://openalex.org/W2019723157,"Daptomycin is an acidic lipopeptide antibiotic that, in the presence of calcium, forms oligomeric pores on membranes containing phosphatidylglycerol. It is clinically used against various Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus species. Genetic studies have indicated that an increased content of cardiolipin in the bacterial membrane may contribute to bacterial resistance against the drug. Here, we used a liposome model to demonstrate that cardiolipin directly inhibits membrane permeabilization by daptomycin. When cardiolipin is added at molar fractions of 10 or 20% to membranes containing phosphatidylglycerol, daptomycin no longer forms pores or translocates to the inner membrane leaflet. Under the same conditions, daptomycin continues to form oligomers; however, these oligomers contain only close to four subunits, which is approximately half as many as observed on membranes without cardiolipin. The collective findings lead us to propose that a daptomycin pore consists of two aligned tetramers in opposite leaflets and that cardiolipin prevents the translocation of tetramers to the inner leaflet, thereby forestalling the formation of complete, octameric pores. Our findings suggest a possible mechanism by which cardiolipin may mediate resistance to daptomycin, and they provide new insights into the action mode of this important antibiotic.

Our findings suggest a possible mechanism by which cardiolipin may mediate resistance to daptomycin, and they provide new insights into the action mode of this important antibiotic. Daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibiotic that consists of 13 amino acids, several of which are nonstandard ones. The 10 C-terminal amino acids form a ring that is closed by an ester bond between a kynurenine residue and a threonine residue, whereas a decanoyl residue is attached to the exocyclic N-terminal tryptophan (Fig. 1). The antibacterial action mode of daptomycin is not yet fully understood and may be multifaceted. Membrane permeabilization and interference with cell division have been demonstrated, whereas inhibition of cell wall synthesis remains somewhat contentious (1.Laganas V. Alder J. Silverman J.A. In vitro bactericidal activities of daptomycin against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis are not mediated by inhibition of lipoteichoic acid biosynthesis.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 2682-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Membrane permeabilization can be observed in model liposomes and involves the formation of an oligomeric and cation- and size-selective pore. Oligomerization and pore formation require phosphatidylglycerol (PG), 2The abbreviations used are: PGphosphatidylglycerolPCphosphocholineDMPC1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholineDMPG1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-rac-(1′-glycerol)PEphosphatidylethanolamineCLcardiolipinTOCLtetraoleyl-cardiolipinLUVlarge unilamellar vesicle(s)NBDNitrobenzoxadiazoleHBSHepes-buffered salineITCisothermal calorimetry. which is abundant in bacterial cell membranes but not in mammalian ones; this presumably contributes to the selectivity of the drug for bacteria (2.Baltz R.H.

Since its approval for clinical use in 2003, daptomycin has assumed a major role in the treatment of infections with Gram-positive pathogens. Although the overall resistance situation is currently still favorable, resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus species occur. Genomic analysis of resistant strains indicate that resistance may involve changes in the lipid composition of the bacterial cell membrane. Such changes include the reduced synthesis of PG (4.Hachmann A.B. Sevim E. Gaballa A. Popham D.L. Antelmann H. Helmann J.D. Reduction in membrane phosphatidylglycerol content leads to daptomycin resistance in Bacillus subtilis.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2011; 55: 4326-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and the increased conversion of PG to lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol (lysyl-PG (6.Friedman L. Alder J.D. Silverman J.A. Genetic changes that correlate with reduced susceptibility to daptomycin in Staphylococcus aureus.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2006; 50: 2137-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar)). Because lysyl-PG is positively charged, it likely detracts from the calcium-mediated membrane binding of daptomycin, which would resemble its known inhibitory effect on cationic antimicrobial peptides. Another set of mutations implicates cardiolipin. Mutations that enhance cardiolipin synthase activity (7.Davlieva M. Zhang W. Arias C.A. Shamoo Y.

Genetic basis for daptomycin resistance in enterococci.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2011; 55: 3345-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), although replacement of the wild-type synthase with a mutant gene into a wild-type Enterococcus faecalis strain did not detectably change the susceptibility to daptomycin (9.Tran T.T.

Agents Chemother. 2013; 57: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Quantitative data on cardiolipin membrane levels in daptomycin-resistant Enterococcus strains are not available; therefore, whether or not changes in cardiolipin content can increase the daptomycin resistance in vivo remains to be elucidated. Here, we examined the question whether or not cardiolipin can in principle affect the susceptibility of membranes to daptomycin. We found that cardiolipin may indeed protect lipid membranes from permeabilization. The inhibitory mechanism of cardiolipin is novel and surprising, and it provides further insight into the mechanism of daptomycin pore formation. Phospholipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) and used as received. For fluorescence experiments, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) and 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-rac-(1′-glycerol) (DMPG) as well as tetraoleyl-cardiolipin (TOCL) were dissolved in chloroform:methanol 3:1, mixed at the molar ratios indicated under “Results,” and dried down under nitrogen and vacuum in a round bottom flask. The lipid film was dispersed in 100 mm NaCl buffered with 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4; Hepes-buffered saline (HBS)), and the lipid suspension was extruded 10–15 times through 100-nm polycarbonate membranes with a nitrogen-driven device (10.Mayer L.D. Hope M.J. Cullis P.R. Vesicles of variable sizes produced by a rapid extrusion procedure.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1568) Google Scholar). The liposomes were used in fluorescence experiments at a final concentration of 250 μm total lipid. All experiments involving these liposomes were carried out at 30 °C. LUV were prepared using the freeze-thaw and extrusion method as described previously (11.Zhang T. Muraih J.K. Mintzer E. Tishbi N. Desert C. Silverman J. Taylor S. Palmer M. Mutual inhibition through hybrid oligomer formation of daptomycin and the semisynthetic lipopeptide antibiotic CB-182,462.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1828: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Lipid films were prepared by mixing appropriate volumes of pure DOPC, DOPG, and TOCL (Avanti) from stock solutions in chloroform and evaporating the solvent under a stream of nitrogen. The resulting films were hydrated in HBS (10 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) to a final total lipid concentration of 5 mm. This procedure was carried out exactly as described. 3T. Zhang, J. Muraih, B. MacCormick, and M. Palmer, M., submitted for publication. Briefly, LUV for fluorescence experiments were prepared as above, but with an internal pH of 6.0 and entrapped pyranine (5 mm internal concentration). The liposomes were diluted into Hepes (10 mm, pH 8.0)-buffered potassium chloride (100 mm) with 5 mm CaCl2 and supplemented with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), 5 nm), valinomycin (0.5 μm), and daptomycin (1 μm) as indicated. After incubation for 300 s, the samples were solubilized with Triton X-100, and the fluorescence signal recorded thereafter was used to normalize the entire data set. Perylene-daptomycin was prepared as described before (13.Muraih J.K. Harris J. Taylor S.D. Palmer M. Characterization of daptomycin oligomerization with perylene excimer fluorescence: stoichiometric binding of phosphatidylglycerol triggers oligomer formation.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1818: 673-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The compound was added to LUV at 2 μm. Calcium was added to 5 mm, the samples were incubated for 5 min, and the fluorescence emission were recorded with excitation at 430 nm. Energetics of daptomycin binding to model membranes was investigated by high sensitivity isothermal titration calorimetry (MicroCal VP-ITC, GE Healthcare) as described in Ref. 11.Zhang T. Muraih J.K. Mintzer E. Tishbi N. Desert C. Silverman J. Taylor S. Palmer M. Mutual inhibition through hybrid oligomer formation of daptomycin and the semisynthetic lipopeptide antibiotic CB-182,462.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1828: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar. Briefly, the sample cell (∼1.4 ml) was filled with 23 μm daptomycin prepared in HBS containing 1 mm calcium, and the reference cell was filled with identical buffer. The 250-μl syringe was loaded with 5 mm total lipid LUV suspension. Daptomycin solutions and lipid suspensions were degassed with stirring under vacuum for 20 min prior to each titration. After system equilibration and a preliminary 1-μl injection that was omitted from data analysis, 2.5-μl aliquots were injected into the sample cell at 6-min intervals. Data were collected by the MicroCal customized Origin software. Baselines were normalized using Nitpic (14.Keller S. Vargas C. Zhao H. Piszczek G. Brautigam C.A. Schuck P. High-precision isothermal titration calorimetry with automated peak-shape analysis.Anal. Chem. 2012; 84: 5066-5073Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), and the results were analyzed with the Origin “one binding site” model. The ability of daptomycin to penetrate lipid monolayers was examined using a Langmuir surface balance and custom-built mini-trough from KSV-Nima (Biolin Scientific, Espoo, Finland). The aqueous subphase was HBS with 1 mm calcium, prepared with water purified through a Milli-Q system (Millipore, Molsheim, France). Lipid solutions were prepared by dissolving DOPC, DOPG, and TOCL in spectroscopy-grade chloroform to concentrations of ∼1 mg/ml. The trough was filled with buffer, and the surface was cleaned by aspirating. Small aliquots of lipid solution were applied to the surface using a Hamilton digital syringe (Reno, NV) until an initial surface pressure of 20 mN/m was obtained. After allowing 10 min for solvent evaporation and monolayer equilibration, 50 μl of 1 mm daptomycin, prepared in identical buffer, were injected into the stirred subphase through a side port to avoid puncturing the monolayer. Daptomycin insertion into the lipid monolayer was monitored over time and detected by surface pressure increase at constant area. Each experiment was performed at least in triplicate. Nitrobenzoxadiazole-daptomycin (NBD-daptomycin) was prepared as described in Ref. 15.Muraih J.K. Pearson A. Silverman J. Palmer M. Oligomerization of daptomycin on membranes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1808: 1154-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar. Fluorescence experiments and data analysis were performed exactly as described previously (16.Muraih J.K. Palmer M. Estimation of the subunit stoichiometry of the membrane-associated daptomycin oligomer by FRET.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1818: 1642-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), except that the lipid composition of the liposomes was varied as indicated under “Results.” For the experiment shown in Fig. 8A, NBD-phosphatidylethanolamine (NBD-PE) was obtained from Avanti and incorporated at 0.5% mol/mol into LUV that otherwise consisted of equal fractions of PC and PG. The liposomes were diluted into HBS supplemented with 25 mm calcium. We found it necessary to raise the concentration this high from the usual value of 5 mm to induce reaction between dithionite and liposomes containing PG; we assume that calcium alleviates the electrostatic repulsion between PG and dithionite. Daptomycin was added to 1 μm where indicated, and the samples were incubated for 5 min before starting the fluorescence measurement (excitation wavelength, 465 nm; emission wavelength, 530 nm). After 1 min, dithionite was added (final concentration 10 mm), and the measurement was continued for ∼5 min before the addition of Triton X-100 to solubilize the liposomes. The experiments illustrated in Fig. 8B were performed analogously, except that NBD-PE was omitted from the liposomes, and daptomycin was replaced with a mixture of NBD-daptomycin and native daptomycin (molar ratio 1:2; total final concentration 1 μm). The inclusion of native daptomycin served to reduce NBD self-quenching. In a recent study, we showed that daptomycin forms cation-selective pores of discrete size in liposomes composed of PC and PG.3 As shown in Fig. 2, the addition of as little as 10% cardiolipin completely inhibits this pore formation. In previous studies, we have shown that membrane permeabilization by daptomycin occurs in several successive stages, namely, monomer binding, oligomerization, and conversion of the oligomer to a functional pore (11.Zhang T. Muraih J.K. Mintzer E. Tishbi N. Desert C. Silverman J. Taylor S. Palmer M.

Estimation of the subunit stoichiometry of the membrane-associated daptomycin oligomer by FRET.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1818: 1642-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The following experiments were carried out to determine which of these stages is subject to inhibition by cardiolipin. The binding of daptomycin to lipid membranes correlates with a strong increase in the intrinsic fluorescence of its kynurenine residue (17.Lakey J.H. Ptak M. Fluorescence indicates a calcium-dependent interaction between the lipopeptide antibiotic LY146032 and phospholipid membranes.Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4639-4645Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Binding also requires calcium, and the calcium concentration required to induce the half-maximal extent of this fluorescence increase ([Ca]50) can be used to compare the affinity of daptomycin for membranes differing in lipid composition. The [Ca]50 is ∼12 mm calcium with pure DMPC membranes, 0.2 mm with DMPC/DMPG membranes (1:1), and 2 mm with DMPC/TOCL membranes. Thus, CL binds daptomycin more avidly than PC but less avidly than PG. When CL is added to PC and PG, the [Ca]50 remains close to 0.2 mm, which suggests that on such membranes, daptomycin interacts with PG rather than CL (data not shown). Oligomerization of membrane-bound daptomycin can be observed through excimer formation of a perylene-labeled daptomycin derivative (13.Muraih J.K. Harris J. Taylor S.D. Palmer M. Characterization of daptomycin oligomerization with perylene excimer fluorescence: stoichiometric binding of phosphatidylglycerol triggers oligomer formation.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1818: 673-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows the fluorescence of perylene-daptomycin on membranes containing PC, PG, and CL in various combinations. As reported in Ref. 13.Muraih J.K. Harris J. Taylor S.D. Palmer M. Characterization of daptomycin oligomerization with perylene excimer fluorescence: stoichiometric binding of phosphatidylglycerol triggers oligomer formation.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1818: 673-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, the emission spectrum observed on PC membranes is typical of perylene monomers, indicating the absence of daptomycin oligomer formation. On membranes consisting of PC and PG, monomer intensity is reduced, and an overlapping, broad-based peak excimer peak centered around 520 nm appears, indicating daptomycin oligomer formation on these membranes. The spectrum obtained with membranes containing PC and CL, but no PG, closely resembles the one from pure PC liposomes. Therefore, unlike PG, cardiolipin does not induce oligomerization of daptomycin. In contrast, membranes that contain both PG and CL do induce formation of excimers, and hence of daptomycin oligomers. The extent of excimer formation can be compared using the ratio of the emission at 560 nm, where monomer fluorescence is negligible, with that at 455 nm, where monomer fluorescence is dominant. In Fig. 3B, this ratio is shown as a function of CL molar fraction in the membrane. The extent of excimer formation drops noticeably from 0 to 10% CL and then increases slightly again as more CL is added. The potential significance of this finding is discussed below. Another method for observing daptomycin oligomerization is the use of FRET between the kynurenine residue of the unlabeled molecule and the fluorescent label NBD attached to the ornithine side chain of a second daptomycin molecule; the NBD derivative retains full antibiotic activity (15.Muraih J.K. Pearson A. Silverman J. Palmer M. Oligomerization of daptomycin on membranes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1808: 1154-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This method has also been used to estimate the number of subunits in a single daptomycin oligomer to 6–7 (16.Muraih J.K. Palmer M. Estimation of the subunit stoichiometry of the membrane-associated daptomycin oligomer by FRET.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1818: 1642-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In those previous experiments, PC/PG membranes where used, which allow the formation of functional pores (cf. Fig. 2A). Because the addition of CL prevents pore formation, we considered that the oligomers that form in the presence of CL might be structurally different and contain a different number of subunits. The method used in this experiment is fully explained in Ref. 16.Muraih J.K. Palmer M. Estimation of the subunit stoichiometry of the membrane-associated daptomycin oligomer by FRET.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1818: 1642-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar. Briefly, native daptomycin and NBD-daptomycin are mixed in various proportions and then applied to liposome membranes. Based on the assumptions of 1) oligomer stability on the time scale of the experiment, 2) random co-oligomerization, and 3) maximally effective FRET between the subunits of the same oligomer, and using corrections for FRET between molecules that are part of separate oligomers, the number of subunits is calculated from the residual observed donor fluorescence. Fig. 4 shows that, indeed, the presence of cardiolipin changes the subunit stoichiometry. With cardiolipin, there were close to four subunits, whereas without CL, the number was close to seven, which is similar to the previously reported value (16.Muraih J.K. Palmer M. Estimation of the subunit stoichiometry of the membrane-associated daptomycin oligomer by FRET.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1818: 1642-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These observations will be further discussed below. To better understand the effect of CL on the membrane interaction of daptomycin, we studied a similar model system with Langmuir monolayers and with ITC. The insertion of daptomycin into PC/PG lipid monolayers can be observed as an increase in surface pressure. The addition of CL to this lipid mixture up to a molar fraction of 10% substantially enhances this response (Fig. 5, A and B). This increase in the surface pressure differential indicates a deeper and/or more stable insertion of daptomycin molecules into monolayers containing CL. The surface pressure differential decreases again when CL is added to molar fractions of 20% or greater. ITC was performed with LUV, which were added to a solution of daptomycin and calcium. Fig. 6 shows that, relative to liposomes containing PC and PG only, the addition of CL up to a molar fraction of 10% raised the enthalpy released by daptomycin binding significantly. This increase in negative enthalpy indicates a greater number of favorable molecular interactions between daptomycin and the lipid molecules of the membrane, which is consistent with the deeper membrane insertion of daptomycin molecules inferred from the surface pressure experiments. The increase in negative enthalpy was accompanied by a decrease in entropy, as obtained by fitting a single-site binding model to the raw data. At a molar fraction of 20% or more CL, the changes to both the enthalpy and the entropy were partially reversible. It may be noted that the response to changes in CL molar fraction was similar in three different assays, namely surface pressure, ITC, and perylene excimer fluorescence, which suggests that these assays reflect the same underlying effect of CL on the membrane interaction of daptomycin. In all three assays, the maximum signal was observed at a CL mole fraction of 10%, whereas higher mole fractions caused a partial reversal. We currently have no experimental basis on which to propose an explanation for this reversal; it may be noted that molar fractions of CL higher than 10% are not common in bacterial membranes. One question that had not been addressed in our previous studies is how daptomycin distributes between the two leaflets of the target membrane. The observation that cardiolipin both prevented pore formation and reduced the number of oligomer subunits by approximately half suggested the possibility that a functional pore might comprise subunits in both leaflets, whereas the nonfunctional oligomers that form in the presence of cardiolipin might be confined to the outer membrane leaflet only (Fig. 7). This hypothesis was tested using the fluorescence of NBD-daptomycin and its sensitivity to quenching with dithionite. NBD is instantly reduced, and its fluorescence is abolished, by dithionite. Because dithionite is membrane-impermeant, this reaction can be used in liposome models to detect the accessibility of membrane-associated molecules from the outside (18.McIntyre J.C. Sleight R.G. Fluorescence assay for phospholipid membrane asymmetry.Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11819-11827Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). A potential complication that arises here, however, is that daptomycin pores might allow dithionite to reach the liposome interior and reduce NBD-daptomycin also bound to the inner leaflet. Therefore, in a control experiment, a small amount of NBD-PE was incorporated into PC/PG liposomes, and its reduction by dithionite was monitored both with and without daptomycin. In both cases, the extent of reduction is close to 50%, which is consistent with a reduction of NBD-PE in the outer leaflet only (Fig. 8A). Thus, in keeping with the previously observed cation selectivity of the daptomycin pore,3 dithionite does not appreciably enter the liposomes on the time scale of the experiment. Dithionite was also excluded by liposomes containing CL in addition to PC and PG, with or without daptomycin (data not shown). Fig. 8B depicts the results obtained with NBD-daptomycin; no NBD-PE was present in these experiments. When NBD-daptomycin was bound to membranes containing PC, PG, and either 10% or 20% CL, almost all NBD fluorescence was immediately quenched. In contrast, the extent of immediate quenching was only about 50% in membranes that contained PC and PG but no CL. The remainder of the fluorescence decayed more slowly with a half-life of ∼60–90 s, which is presumably due to the redistribution of daptomycin from the inner to the outer leaflet. These findings support the notion that daptomycin is able to distribute symmetrically and reversibly between both membrane leaflets in PC/PG membranes, but unable to translocate across membranes containing 10 or 20% CL. In this study, we have shown that cardiolipin inhibits the pore-forming activity of daptomycin in a liposome model. This study was prompted by genetic studies on daptomycin resistance, which suggest that bacteria may become more resistant to daptomycin by increasing the content of cardiolipin in their cell membranes. We found that inclusion of 10% CL in model membranes was sufficient to effectively suppress membrane translocation and pore formation in liposomes. This fractional amount of CL is at the upper end of the range reported for bacterial cell membranes (19.Clejan S. Krulwich T.A. Mondrus K.R. Seto-Young D.

Bacteriol. 1969; 99: 298-303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which suggests that this mechanism may be relevant for bacterial resistance to daptomycin. Formation of daptomycin pores in bacterial cell membranes, as detected by membrane depolarization, is well documented (22.Alborn Jr., W.E. Allen N.E. Preston D.A. Daptomycin disrupts membrane potential in growing Staphylococcus aureus.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1991; 35: 2282-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 23.Silverman J.A. Perlmutter N.G.

C.Google Scholar). It seems possible that an increased cardiolipin content would inhibit pore formation in vivo; however, this has yet to be experimentally examined. Daptomycin may also damage bacteria by more than one mechanism. If so, inhibition of pore formation may not suffice to prevent bactericidal action, and additional resistance mechanisms would then be required to counter the other antibacterial action modes of the drug. Whether or not the effect of CL observed in vitro has a role in bacterial resistance, the findings of our study do provide significant new insight into the mechanism of daptomycin action. Firstly, they show that oligomers can form in the outer leaflet alone. However, these oligomers do not form functional pores, and they do not reach the full number of subunits; instead, they contain only four subunits. Pore formation correlates with daptomycin reaching the inner membrane leaflet, and with an increase in the apparent subunit stoichiometry to 6–7. To account for the collective findings, we propose a working model of pore formation that comprises the following steps (cf. Fig. 7): 1) calcium-mediated binding of monomeric daptomycin to PG in the outer leaflet of the target membrane; 2) formation of a tetramer from four bound monomers (this step occurs in the outer leaflet and is preserved in membranes that contain cardiolipin); 3) translocation of tetramers from the outer leaflet to the inner leaflet (this step is disrupted on membranes containing CL); and 4) alignment of two tetramers in the opposite leaflets to form an octameric functional pore. In such an octamer, half of the subunits are located in the outer leaflet and hence subject to reduction by dithionite right away. The observation that the remainder of the NBD fluorescence is subject to protracted but ultimately complete reduction indicates that the translocation from the outer to the inner leaflet is reversible. The reverse translocation might conceivably involve the dissociation of octamers into tetramers. However, we could find no evidence of such a dissociation in preliminary experiments, and we therefore favor the view that translocation comes about through the trading of places between individual subunits within an intact octamer. Although this model accounts for most of the available evidence without contortions, the postulated octamer obviously is at odds with the subunit stoichiometry (n) of 6–7 that was experimentally obtained with PC/PG membranes here and earlier (16.Muraih J.K. Palmer M. Estimation of the subunit stoichiometry of the membrane-associated daptomycin oligomer by FRET.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1818: 1642-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Two effects might account for this discrepancy. Firstly, it is possible that not all tetramers assemble into octamers. In that case, the experimentally determined n would reflect an average of tetramers and octamers, weighted for abundance. However, because we could not detect dissociation of octamers into tetramers, it seems likely that the number of free tetramers is low at equilibrium. Secondly, as was pointed out in our previous study (16.Muraih J.K. Palmer M. Estimation of the subunit stoichiometry of the membrane-associated daptomycin oligomer by FRET.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1818: 1642-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the value of n obtained from FRET experiments may underestimate the true value. The efficiency of FRET is limited by the Förster distance, which was estimated to 2.7 nm for the couple of donor and acceptor labels used here (kynurenine in unlabeled daptomycin and NBD-daptomycin, respectively). The distance between subunits that belong to the same oligomer, yet reside in opposite membrane leaflets, might approach or even exceed this value, which would significantly diminish FRET. Because our analysis assumes FRET to be maximally effective between any two positions within the same oligomer (16.Muraih J.K. Palmer M. Estimation of the subunit stoichiometry of the membrane-associated daptomycin oligomer by FRET.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1818: 1642-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), a less than maximal FRET efficiency will cause the calculated value of n to underestimate the true value. Based on the currently available evidence, we consider this the most likely explanation. If we assume the above model to be correct, the question arises exactly how cardiolipin may inhibit membrane translocation of daptomycin tetramers. This inhibitory effect was accompanied by several other changes. The slight drop of perylene excimer fluorescence (Fig. 2B) may correspond to the fraction of excimers that form between perylene-daptomycin molecules in two opposite tetramers that are part of the same octamer, whereas the remaining excimer fluorescence arises from proximity within single tetramers. In liposomes, CL effected a notable increase in daptomycin binding enthalpy, which suggests an increase in the number of favorable molecular contacts (25.Abraham T. Lewis R.N.A.H. Hodges R.S. McElhaney R.N. Isothermal titration calorimetry studies of the binding of a rationally designed analogue of the antimicrobial peptide gramicidin s to phospholipid bilayer membranes.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2103-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In lipid monolayers, CL caused a greater increase in surface pressure in response to a given quantity of daptomycin. This suggests a deeper insertion of daptomycin into membranes containing moderate amounts of CL, which should increase the number of molecular contacts between daptomycin and the surrounding lipids, and therefore agrees with the findings from the ITC experiments. A similar inhibitory effect of CL on membrane pore formation has previously been observed with the antimicrobial peptide magainin, and together with related findings has been interpreted in terms of lipid curvature strain (26.Matsuzaki K. Sugishita K. Ishibe N. Ueha M. Nakata S. Miyajima K. Epand R.M. Relationship of membrane curvature to the formation of pores by magainin 2.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11856-11863Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). According to this explanation, the peptide claims space in the head group layer of the membrane. CL and other “cone-shaped” lipid species that provide more bulk in the hydrophobic acyl chain layer than in the head group layer accommodate the peptide, whereas lipids with larger head groups compete with it for space, promoting distension and bending of the head group layer, which leads to the formation of a toroidal pore. The mechanism proposed for magainin may also underlie the effect of CL on daptomycin (Fig. 7). Such a model might lead one to expect that, because of the greater competition for space in the head group layer of monolayers without CL, daptomycin insertion into such monolayers should raise the surface pressure to a greater extent than without CL, which is the opposite of what we observed (Fig. 5). Possibly, the unstable situation illustrated in Fig. 7B may relax by transitioning either toward the toroidal defect (Fig. 7, C and D) or toward a less deeply inserted configuration, in which the bulk of the peptide remains outside of the lipid membrane and does not add lateral pressure to it (Fig. 7A). In any event, an improved accommodation of daptomycin within CL-containing membranes would agree with the increase in negative enthalpy reported here. In this context, it is worth noting that CL is believed to be enriched in localized domains in bacterial cell membranes (27.Kawai F. Shoda M. Harashima R. Sadaie Y. Hara H. Matsumoto K. Cardiolipin domains in Bacillus subtilis marburg membranes.J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This might account for the inhomogeneous distribution of daptomycin on cell surfaces (28.Pogliano J. Pogliano N. Silverman J.A. Daptomycin-mediated reorganization of membrane architecture causes mislocalization of essential cell division proteins.J. Bacteriol. 2012; 194: 4494-4504Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar); the correlation has, however, not been established. A tighter interaction between daptomycin and membrane lipids might also account for the decrease in entropy that was observed concomitantly with increases in negative enthalpy. However, one should keep in mind that the entropy values were obtained through the use of a single-site binding model, and although this model is able to numerically fit the ITC titration curves rather well, we must not forget that daptomycin not only binds as a monomer but subsequently also forms oligomers, so that any model that assumes a one-step interaction can only be considered an approximation. Caution is therefore required with respect to interpreting the calculated entropy. In sum, we have obtained evidence that supports a novel structural model of the daptomycin pore and suggests a possible mechanism of bacterial resistance to daptomycin. We presently have no way to further corroborate this hypothetical model. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that many cation channels and pores have tetradic symmetry. Intriguingly, with the Pseudomonas lipopeptide tolaasin I, whose structure is not closely related to daptomycin, the very same kind of octameric symmetry spanning both leaflets has been obtained from in silico studies (12.Jo G. Hwang D. Lee S. Woo Y. Hyun J. Yong Y. Kang K. Kim D.W. Lim Y. In silico study of the ion channel formed by tolaasin I produced by Pseudomonas tolaasii.J. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2011; 21: 1097-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We therefore feel that this structural model deserves consideration in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2083153865,"Pupillary measures have been linked to arousal and attention as well as activity in the brainstem's locus coeruleus norepinephrine (LC-NE) system. Similarly, there is evidence that evoked EEG responses, such as the P3, might have LC-NE activity as their basis. Since it is not feasible to record electrophysiological data directly from the LC in humans due to its location in the brainstem, an open question has been whether pupillary measures and EEG variability can be linked in a meaningful way to shed light on the nature of the LC-NE role in attention and arousal. We used an auditory oddball task with a data-driven approach to learn task-relevant projections of the EEG, for windows of data spanning the entire trial. We investigated linear and quadratic relationships between the evoked EEG along these projections and both prestimulus (baseline) and poststimulus (evoked dilation) pupil diameter measurements. We found that baseline pupil diameter correlates with early (175–200 ms) and late (350–400 ms) EEG component variability, suggesting a linear relationship between baseline (tonic) LC-NE activity and evoked EEG. We found no relationships between evoked EEG and evoked pupil dilation, which is often associated with evoked (phasic) LC activity. After regressing out reaction time (RT), the correlation between EEG variability and baseline pupil diameter remained, suggesting that such correlation is not explainable by RT variability. We also investigated the relationship between these pupil measures and prestimulus EEG alpha activity, which has been reported as a marker of attentional state, and found a negative linear relationship with evoked pupil dilation. In summary, our results demonstrate significant relationships between prestimulus and poststimulus neural and pupillary measures, and they provide further evidence for tight coupling between attentional state and evoked neural activity and for the role of cortical and subcortical networks underlying the process of target detection."
https://openalex.org/W2003231418,"Adolescent males have an increased risk of developing schizophrenia, implicating testosterone in the precipitation of dopamine-related psychopathology. Evidence from adult rodent brain indicates that testosterone can modulate nigrostriatal dopamine. However, studies are required to understand the role testosterone plays in maturation of dopamine pathways during adolescence and to elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) by which testosterone exerts its effects. We hypothesized that molecular indices of dopamine neurotransmission [synthesis (tyrosine hydroxylase), breakdown (catechol-O-methyl transferase; monoamine oxygenase), transport [vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT), dopamine transporter (DAT)] and receptors (DRD1-D5)] would be changed by testosterone or its metabolites, dihydrotestosterone and 17β-estradiol, in the nigrostriatal pathway of adolescent male rats. We found that testosterone and dihydrotestosterone increased DAT and VMAT mRNAs in the substantia nigra and that testosterone increased DAT protein at the region of the cell bodies, but not in target regions in the striatum. Dopamine receptor D2 mRNA was increased and D3 mRNA was decreased in substantia nigra and/or striatum by androgens. These data suggest that increased testosterone at adolescence may change dopamine responsivity of the nigrostriatal pathway by modulating, at a molecular level, the capacity of neurons to transport and respond to dopamine. Further, dopamine turnover was increased in the dorsal striatum following gonadectomy and this was prevented by testosterone replacement. Gene expression changes in the dopaminergic cell body region may serve to modulate both dendritic dopamine feedback inhibition and reuptake in the dopaminergic somatodendritic field as well as dopamine release and re-uptake dynamics at the presynaptic terminals in the striatum. These testosterone-induced changes of molecular indices of dopamine neurotransmission in males are primarily androgen receptor-driven events as estradiol had minimal effect. We conclude that nigrostriatal responsivity to dopamine may be modulated by testosterone acting via androgen receptors to alter gene expression of molecules involved in dopamine signaling during adolescence."

This study determined the effect of post-stroke IGF-1 treatment, and used microRNA profiling to identify mechanisms underlying IGF-1’s neuroprotective actions. Post-stroke ICV administration of IGF-1 to middle-aged female rats reduced infarct volume by 39% when measured 24h later. MicroRNA analyses of ischemic tissue collected at the early post-stroke phase (4h) indicated that 8 out of 168 disease-related miRNA were significantly downregulated by IGF-1. KEGG pathway analysis implicated these miRNA in PI3K-Akt signaling, cell adhesion/ECM receptor pathways and T-and B-cell signaling. Specific components of these pathways were subsequently analyzed in vehicle and IGF-1 treated middle-aged females. Phospho-Akt was reduced by ischemia at 4h, but elevated by IGF-1 treatment at 24h. IGF-1 induced Akt activation was preceded by a reduction of blood brain barrier permeability at 4h post-stroke and global suppression of cytokines including IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α. A subset of these cytokines including IL-6 was also suppressed by IGF-1 at 24h post-stroke. These data are the first to show that the temporal and mechanistic components of post-stroke IGF-1 treatment in older animals, and that cellular components of the blood brain barrier may serve as critical targets of IGF-1 in the aging brain."

Antibodies against β-actin, lamin B, O-GlcNAc (RL-2), 14-3-3, collagen IV, tubulin, ChREBP (for the proximity ligation assay), and goat IgG were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies against OGT, FAS, VEGF, and HA were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Antibodies against ACC, rabbit IgG, and mouse IgG were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-ChREBP (from Novus Biologicals, except for the proximity ligation assay), anti-fibronectin (BD Biosciences), anti-HIF-1α (Thermo Scientific), and anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) were obtained from the indicated sources. Rat mesangial cells and HEK293 cells were purchased from ATCC (CRL-2573TM and CRL-1573TM, respectively). The culture medium for the cells was DMEM, 5.6 mmol/liter glucose, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml) at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2. The media were changed every other day. Nearly confluent cells were incubated for 16 h in serum-free medium prior to treatment. Experimental medium was DMEM with low glucose (5.6 mmol/liter) with or without additional an 20 mmol/liter d-glucose or DMEM without glucose (Invitrogen, catalogue no. 11966-025) and lasted 24 h.

The mesangial cells were transiently transfected with ChREBP wild type or W130A or empty vector plasmids in addition to Mlx, β-galactosidase, and luciferase plasmids. After 24 h, the culture medium was replaced with medium containing the indicated concentrations of glucose and incubated for an additional 24 h. β-Galactosidase plasmid was used as a control for the normalization of transfection efficiency. The cell pellet or kidney cortex was lysed in NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Thermo Scientific) or M-PER mammalian protein extraction reagent (Thermo Scientific) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and phosphatase inhibitor mixture I + II (Sigma), and fractional protein was extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions. The protein level was quantified using the Bradford procedure. 30 μg of whole cell extracts, cytoplasmic extracts, or nuclear extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to an enhanced nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were then washed with TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), blocked with 5% skim milk for 1 h, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody at the dilutions recommended by the supplier. The membrane was then washed with TBST, and the secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The bands were visualized using EZ-Western Lumi Pico Western blotting detection reagents (Daeillab Service Co., Seoul, Korea) on x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co. BioMax light film) or a luminescent image analyzer (ImageQuant LAS4000 mini, GE Healthcare). Total RNA was extracted from the cells using TRIzol according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was carried out with 1 μg of total RNA using an RT Premix reverse transcription system kit (AccuPower, Seoul, Korea) with oligo(dT)18 primers. 2 μl of the RT products was amplified with a PCR Premix kit (AccuPower, Seoul, Korea).

Ogt insert DNA was generated by PCR using primers 5′-aagtcgaccatggtgcagaaggagagtca-3′ and 5′-aagcggccgctcacaggctccgaccaagta-3′ from pCMV-SPORT6-hOGA as a template. Each amplified fragment was digested with SalI and NotI and inserted into pCMV-HA, respectively. Mesangial cells were stabilized for 24 h before they were transfected with the DNAs. The culture medium was exchanged, and the constructs were transfected into the mesangial cells using GeneExpresso Max transfection reagent (Excellgen, Rockville, MD), as instructed by the manufacturers. Cells were co-transfected with FLAG-tagged ChREBP and HA-tagged Mlx using GeneExpresso Max transfection reagent (Excellgen, Rockville, MD). After 24 h, cells were collected in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40 with protease inhibitors and then lysed by vortexing. Equal amounts of lysate were incubated overnight with 2 μg of primary antibody rotating at 4 °C, followed by incubation with 30 μl of protein A/G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were extensively washed, resuspended in 2× sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Nuclear extracts of kidney cortexes from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats or normal rats were immunoprecipitated under the same protocol described above. Mesangial cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed by permeabilization with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and washed three times for 10 min each with PBS. Cells were incubated for 1 h with 5% (v/v) BSA in PBS and incubated overnight with anti-ChREBP primary antibody (1:500) in a solution containing 5% (v/v) BSA in PBS and washed three times for 10 min each with PBS. Cells were incubated with a secondary FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) for an additional 1 h. Nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) during the final incubation step. Cells were imaged using a microscope (Nicon Te-300, Nicon (Melville, NY)). Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, washed with 60% isopropyl alcohol. Then the cells were stained for 10 min in 0.2% Oil Red O dissolved in 60% isopropyl alcohol and washed four times with distilled water, followed by additional hematoxylin staining for 30 s and washed four times with water. Cells were imaged using a microscope (Leica DM IRB, Leica Microsystems Inc. (Deerfield, IL)). Cells cultured on coverglass with or without additional 30 mm glucose were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and washed with distilled water. Staining was performed using the Picrosirius Red stain kit (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stained cells were mounted and imaged using a microscope (Nicon Te-300, Nicon). An in situ proximity ligation assay was performed in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Diabetes was induced by injection of streptozotocin (STZ; 35 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) dissolved in cold and fresh citrate buffer (0.1 m and pH 4.5). After 2 weeks, all rats were sacrificed, and kidney was extracted. Experiments were performed in accordance with National Institutes of Health animal research standards, and protocols were approved by the Chonnam National University Laboratory Animal Research Center. Fixed kidneys in 10% neutral buffered formalin were embedded in paraffin and cut at a 10-μm thickness. Paraffin sections were deparaffinized with Histochoice (Amresco) and rehydrated with serial diluted ethanol. Sections were steamed in sodium citrate buffer (10 mm sodium citrate, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0) for antigen retrieval and washed with PBS. Then a proximity ligation assay was performed using Duolink (Olink Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the sections were incubated with primary antibodies (anti-ChREBP and RL-2), diluted to 1:20 in antibody diluents supplied, overnight at 4 °C. The Duolink proximity ligation assay probes were incubated in a preheated humidity chamber for 1 h at 37 °C, and then, ligation and amplification were performed. To reduce tissue autofluorescence, sections were incubated with copper sulfate (5 mm CuSO4 in 50 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 5.0) for 20 min (29Potter K.A. Simon J.S. Velagapudi B. Capadona J.R. Reduction of autofluorescence at the microelectrode-cortical tissue interface improves antibody detection.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2012; 203: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), followed by mounting with ProLong® Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). The stained sections were observed using a BX-40 apparatus (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with an eXcope X3 digital camera (DIXI Optics, Daejeon, South Korea). The contents of triglyceride and cholesterol were determined using colorimetric kits (BioVision) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For triglyceride quantification, cells cultured on 10-cm dishes were homogenized in a 1-ml solution containing 5% Nonidet P-40 in water, heated to 100 °C in a water bath for 5 min, and then cooled down to room temperature two times. Samples were centrifuged, and the supernatants were diluted 10-fold with water. For cholesterol quantification, cells were extracted with chloroform/isopropyl alcohol/Nonidet P-40 in a microhomogenizer. Samples were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and supernatants were dried under vacuum for 30 min to remove organic solvent. Dried lipids were dissolved with cholesterol assay buffer. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm. The results were expressed as the mean ± S.E. Values are the mean ± S.E. of three or four independent experiments. All of the experiments were analyzed by analysis of variance. In some experiments, such as RT-PCR and Western immunoblotting using inhibitors, a comparison of the treatment means was made with the control using the Bonferroni-Dunn test. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. We first examined whether O-GlcNAc in mesangial cells was altered in diabetes. We treated mesangial cells with 0, 5.5 (low glucose; LG), or 25 mm glucose (high glucose; HG) for 24 h and monitored the increase of O-GlcNAc modification under the HG condition, which mimics a diabetic glucose concentration (Fig. 1A). Among proteins related to glucose metabolism, ChREBP, which acts as a glucose sensor, is regulated by O-linked GlcNAc modification (17Sakiyama H. Fujiwara N. Noguchi T. Eguchi H. Yoshihara D. Uyeda K. Suzuki K. The role of O-linked GlcNAc modification on the glucose response of ChREBP.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 402: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To determine whether ChREBP is regulated in mesangial cells under the HG condition, we evaluated ChREBP levels. The ChREBP level was increased under the HG condition (Fig. 1B), whereas palmitic acid did not increase the protein level, although palmitic acid moderately increased the O-GlcNAc pool in a concentration-dependent manner in mesangial cells (Fig. 1, C and D). Furthermore, ChREBP O-GlcNAcylation was increased under the HG condition compared with the LG condition based on immunoprecipitation with an anti-ChREBP antibody followed by immunoblotting with an anti-RL-2 antibody (Fig. 1E). This relationship between ChREBP and the HG condition in mesangial cells warranted further investigation as to whether ChREBP is regulated and plays a role in mesangial cells exposed to HG. To assess the effect of ChREBP O-GlcNAcylation under the HG condition in mesangial cells, the OGT or Mgea5 (which codes for OGA) gene was transfected into mesangial cells. The HG-induced increase in the ChREBP mRNA level was unaffected by overexpression of either OGA or OGT, whereas HG induction of mRNAs of ChREBP target genes (Acc, Fas, and L-pk) was abolished by overexpression of OGA but not OGT (Fig. 2A). Instead, the HG-induced increase in the ChREBP level was affected by OGA (Fig. 2B). When cells were transfected with OGA or OGT, the expression of the other countergene was also increased modestly, possibly because alterations in OGT or OGA protein levels cause a reciprocal change in the expression of the other (30Slawson C.

https://openalex.org/W1999601929,"Bcl-XL binds to Bax, inhibiting Bax oligomerization required for mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) during apoptosis. How Bcl-XL binds to Bax in the membrane is not known. Here, we investigated the structural organization of Bcl-XL·Bax complexes formed in the MOM, including the binding interface and membrane topology, using site-specific cross-linking, compartment-specific labeling, and computational modeling. We found that one heterodimer interface is formed by a specific interaction between the Bcl-2 homology 1-3 (BH1-3) groove of Bcl-XL and the BH3 helix of Bax, as defined previously by the crystal structure of a truncated Bcl-XL protein and a Bax BH3 peptide (Protein Data Bank entry 3PL7). We also discovered a novel interface in the heterodimer formed by equivalent interactions between the helix 1 regions of Bcl-XL and Bax when their helical axes are oriented either in parallel or antiparallel. The two interfaces are located on the cytosolic side of the MOM, whereas helix 9 of Bcl-XL is embedded in the membrane together with helices 5, 6, and 9 of Bax. Formation of the helix 1·helix 1 interface partially depends on the formation of the groove·BH3 interface because point mutations in the latter interface and the addition of ABT-737, a groove-binding BH3 mimetic, blocked the formation of both interfaces. The mutations and ABT-737 also prevented Bcl-XL from inhibiting Bax oligomerization and subsequent MOMP, suggesting that the structural organization in which interactions at both interfaces contribute to the overall stability and functionality of the complex represents antiapoptotic Bcl-XL·Bax complexes in the MOM."
https://openalex.org/W1989698093,"Benefits of exercise on nerve regeneration and functional recovery have been reported in both central and peripheral nervous system disease models. However, underlying molecular mechanisms of enhanced regeneration and improved functional outcomes are less understood. We used a peripheral nerve regeneration model that has a good correlation between functional outcomes and number of motor axons that regenerate to evaluate the impact of treadmill exercise. In this model, the median nerve was transected and repaired while the ulnar nerve was transected and prevented from regeneration. Daily treadmill exercise resulted in faster recovery of the forelimb grip function as evaluated by grip power and inverted holding test. Daily exercise also resulted in better regeneration as evaluated by recovery of compound motor action potentials, higher number of axons in the median nerve and larger myofiber size in target muscles. Furthermore, these observations correlated with higher levels of neurotrophic factors, glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), in serum, nerve and muscle suggesting that increase in muscle derived neurotrophic factors may be responsible for improved regeneration."

Reported median overall survival (OS) ranges from a few to several years for MF, a decade or more for ET and PV. The study objective was to compare US survival rates of ET, PV, and MF patients with matched non-MPN/non-cancer controls in a nationally representative database.Data were taken retrospectively from the Survey, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database. Medicare enrollees with a new SEER MPN diagnosis between Jan 1, 2001 and Dec 31, 2007 were eligible. First MPN diagnosis was required at or after Medicare enrollment to allow for continuous follow-up. Non-MPN/non-cancer control groups were selected from Medicare separately for each MPN subtype and demographically matched to cases at a ratio of 5:1. Survival was determined starting from the case diagnosis date using the Kaplan-Meier method.A total of 3,364 MPN patients (n = 1,217 ET; 1,625 PV; 522 MF) met the inclusion criteria and were matched to controls. Mean age was 78.4, 76.1, and 77.4 years for ET, PV, and MF, respectively, and percent female was 63, 50, and 41. Median OS was significantly (p<0.05) lower for MPN cases vs. controls (ET: 68 vs. 101 months; PV: 65 vs. 104; MF: 24 vs. 106).In the US Medicare population, survival in MF patients was worse than that of patients with ET or PV and significantly worse than matched controls. Survival of patients with ET or PV was substantially inferior to matched controls. These findings have implications for the clinical management of MPN patients and underscore the need for effective therapies in all MPN subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W2059793057,"Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, contains exclusively iron-dependent superoxide dismutases (Fe-SODs) located in different subcellular compartments. Peroxynitrite, a key cytotoxic and oxidizing effector biomolecule, reacted with T. cruzi mitochondrial (Fe-SODA) and cytosolic (Fe-SODB) SODs with second order rate constants of 4.6 ± 0.2 × 10(4) M(-1) s(-1) and 4.3 ± 0.4 × 10(4) M(-1) s(-1) at pH 7.4 and 37 °C, respectively. Both isoforms are dose-dependently nitrated and inactivated by peroxynitrite. Susceptibility of T. cruzi Fe-SODA toward peroxynitrite was similar to that reported previously for Escherichia coli Mn- and Fe-SODs and mammalian Mn-SOD, whereas Fe-SODB was exceptionally resistant to oxidant-mediated inactivation. We report mass spectrometry analysis indicating that peroxynitrite-mediated inactivation of T. cruzi Fe-SODs is due to the site-specific nitration of the critical and universally conserved Tyr(35). Searching for structural differences, the crystal structure of Fe-SODA was solved at 2.2 Å resolution. Structural analysis comparing both Fe-SOD isoforms reveals differences in key cysteines and tryptophan residues. Thiol alkylation of Fe-SODB cysteines made the enzyme more susceptible to peroxynitrite. In particular, Cys(83) mutation (C83S, absent in Fe-SODA) increased the Fe-SODB sensitivity toward peroxynitrite. Molecular dynamics, electron paramagnetic resonance, and immunospin trapping analysis revealed that Cys(83) present in Fe-SODB acts as an electron donor that repairs Tyr(35) radical via intramolecular electron transfer, preventing peroxynitrite-dependent nitration and consequent inactivation of Fe-SODB. Parasites exposed to exogenous or endogenous sources of peroxynitrite resulted in nitration and inactivation of Fe-SODA but not Fe-SODB, suggesting that these enzymes play distinctive biological roles during parasite infection of mammalian cells."

In this study, we report that IRS1/2 promotes Wnt/β-catenin signaling by stabilizing Dvl2. We found that IRS1/2 interacts with Dvl2. Overexpression of IRS1/2 increased the protein level of Dvl2 and promoted canonical Wnt signaling, as evidenced by the increased T cell-specific factor 4 transcriptional activity and the up-regulation of expression of CYCLIN D1 and c-MYC, two Wnt target genes critical for cell growth, whereas depletion of IRS1/2 reduced the level of Dvl2 and attenuated Wnt/β-catenin signaling.

Methods Hepatic mitochondrial polarization, permeability transition (MPT), and reduce pyridine nucleotides, and steatosis in mice were monitored by intravital confocal/multiphoton microscopy of the fluorescence of rhodamine 123 (Rh123), calcein, NAD(P)H, and BODIPY493/503, respectively, after gavage with ethanol (1–6 g/kg). Results Mitochondria depolarized in an all-or-nothing fashion in individual hepatocytes as early as 1 h after alcohol. Depolarization was dose- and time-dependent, peaked after 6 to 12 h and maximally affected 94% of hepatocytes. This mitochondrial depolarization was not due to onset of the MPT. After 24 h, mitochondria of most hepatocytes recovered normal polarization and were indistinguishable from untreated after 7 days. Cell death monitored by propidium iodide staining, histology and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) was low throughout. After alcohol, mitochondrial NAD(P)H autofluorescence increased and decreased, respectively, in hepatocytes with polarized and depolarized mitochondria. Ethanol also caused steatosis mainly in hepatocytes with depolarized mitochondria. Depolarization was linked to ethanol metabolism, since deficiency of alcohol dehydrogenase and cytochrome-P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), the major ethanol-metabolizing enzymes, decreased mitochondrial depolarization by ∼70% and ∼20%, respectively. Activation of aldehyde dehydrogenase decreased depolarization, whereas inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase enhanced depolarization. Activation of aldehyde dehydrogenase also markedly decreased steatosis. Conclusions Acute ethanol causes reversible hepatic mitochondrial depolarization in vivo that may contribute to steatosis and increased mitochondrial respiration. Onset of this mitochondrial depolarization is linked, at least in part, to metabolism of ethanol to acetaldehyde."
https://openalex.org/W2062197183,"The physical mechanism by which cells sense high-frequency mechanical signals of small magnitude is unknown. During exposure to vibrations, cell populations within a bone are subjected not only to acceleratory motions but also to fluid shear as a result of fluid-cell interactions. We explored displacements of the cell nucleus during exposure to vibrations with a finite element (FE) model and tested in vitro whether vibrations can affect osteocyte communication independent of fluid shear. Osteocyte like MLO-Y4 cells were subjected to vibrations at acceleration magnitudes of 0.15 g and 1 g and frequencies of 30 Hz and 100 Hz. Gap junctional intracellular communication (GJIC) in response to these four individual vibration regimes was investigated. The FE model demonstrated that vibration induced dynamic accelerations caused larger relative nuclear displacement than fluid shear. Across the four regimes, vibrations significantly increased GJIC between osteocytes by 25%. Enhanced GJIC was independent of vibration induced fluid shear; there were no differences in GJIC between the four different vibration regimes even though differences in fluid shear generated by the four regimes varied 23-fold. Vibration induced increases in GJIC were not associated with altered connexin 43 (Cx43) mRNA or protein levels, but were dependent on Akt activation. Combined, the in silico and in vitro experiments suggest that externally applied vibrations caused nuclear motions and that large differences in fluid shear did not influence nuclear motion (<1%) or GJIC, perhaps indicating that vibration induced nuclear motions may directly increase GJIC. Whether the increase in GJIC is instrumental in modulating anabolic and anti-catabolic processes associated with the application of vibrations remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W1994112476,"Galectins are a lectin family characterized by a conserved sequence motif in the carbohydrate recognition domain, which preferential binds to galactosyl moieties. However, few studies about the biological roles of galectins in invertebrates have been reported except for the galectin (CvGal1) from the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica. Furthermore, galectins have been described in only a few crustacean species, and no functional studies have been reported so far. In this study, we identified and functionally characterized a galectin from the kuruma shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus, which we designated MjGal. Upon Vibrio anguillarum challenge, expression of MjGal was up-regulated mostly in hemocytes and hepatopancreas, and the protein bound to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria through the recognition of lipoteichoic acid (LTA) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), respectively. By also binding to the shrimp hemocyte surface, MjGal functions as an opsonin for microbial pathogens, promoting their phagocytosis. Further, as shown by RNA interference, MjGal participates in clearance of bacteria from circulation, and thereby contributes to the shrimp’s immune defense against infectious challenge. Elucidation of functional and mechanistic aspects of shrimp immunity will enable the development of novel strategies for intervention in infectious diseases currently affecting the shrimp farming industry worldwide."

https://openalex.org/W2078648567,"Glucosinolates are major secondary metabolites found in the Brassicaceae family. These compounds play an essential role in plant defense against biotic and abiotic stresses, but more interestingly they have beneficial effects on human health. We performed a genetic analysis in order to identify the genome regions regulating glucosinolates biosynthesis in a DH mapping population of Brassica oleracea. In order to obtain a general overview of regulation in the whole plant, analyses were performed in the three major organs where glucosinolates are synthesized (leaves, seeds and flower buds). Eighty two significant QTLs were detected, which explained a broad range of variability in terms of individual and total glucosinolate (GSL) content. A meta-analysis rendered eighteen consensus QTLs. Thirteen of them regulated more than one glucosinolate and its content. In spite of the considerable variability of glucosinolate content and profiles across the organ, some of these consensus QTLs were identified in more than one tissue. Consensus QTLs control the GSL content by interacting epistatically in complex networks. Based on in silico analysis within the B. oleracea genome along with synteny with Arabidopsis, we propose seven major candidate loci that regulate GSL biosynthesis in the Brassicaceae family. Three of these loci control the content of aliphatic GSL and four of them control the content of indolic glucosinolates. GSL-ALK plays a central role in determining aliphatic GSL variation directly and by interacting epistatically with other loci, thus suggesting its regulatory effect."
https://openalex.org/W2065276924,"Antibodies that preferentially and specifically target pathological oligomeric protein and peptide assemblies, as opposed to their monomeric and amyloid counterparts, provide therapeutic and diagnostic opportunities for protein misfolding diseases. Unfortunately, the molecular properties associated with oligomer-specific antibodies are not well understood, and this limits targeted design and development. We present here a generic method that enables the design and optimisation of oligomer-specific antibodies. The method takes a two-step approach where discrimination between oligomers and fibrils is first accomplished through identification of cryptic epitopes exclusively buried within the structure of the fibrillar form. The second step discriminates between monomers and oligomers based on differences in avidity. We show here that a simple divalent mode of interaction, as within e.g. the IgG isotype, can increase the binding strength of the antibody up to 1500 times compared to its monovalent counterpart. We expose how the ability to bind oligomers is affected by the monovalent affinity and the turnover rate of the binding and, importantly, also how oligomer specificity is only valid within a specific concentration range. We provide an example of the method by creating and characterising a spectrum of different monoclonal antibodies against both the Aβ peptide and α-synuclein that are associated with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, respectively. The approach is however generic, does not require identification of oligomer-specific architectures, and is, in essence, applicable to all polypeptides that form oligomeric and fibrillar assemblies."
https://openalex.org/W1972733100,"Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) plays a central role in the regulation of diverse biological processes, including immune responses, development, cell growth, and cell survival. To establish persistent infection, many viruses have evolved strategies to evade the host's antiviral immune defenses. In the case of hepatitis B virus (HBV), which can cause chronic infection in the liver, immune evasion strategies used by the virus are not fully understood. It has recently been reported that the polymerase of HBV (Pol) inhibits interferon-β (IFN-β) activity by disrupting the interaction between IKKε and the DDX3. In the current study, we found that HBV Pol suppressed NF-κB signaling, which can also contribute to IFN-β production. HBV Pol did not alter the level of NF-κB expression, but it prevented NF-κB subunits involved in both the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways from entering the nucleus. Further experiments demonstrated that HBV Pol preferentially suppressed the activity of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex by disrupting the association of IKK/NEMO with Cdc37/Hsp90, which is critical for the assembly of the IKK complex and recruitment of the IKK complex to the tumor necrosis factor type 1 receptor (TNF-R1). Furthermore, we found that HBV Pol inhibited the NF-κB-mediated transcription of target genes. Taken together, it is suggested that HBV Pol could counteract host innate immune responses by interfering with two distinct signaling pathways required for IFN-β activation. Our studies therefore shed light on a potential therapeutic target for persistent infection with HBV."
https://openalex.org/W2048223125,"The main goal of this study is to compare the effects of pH, uranium concentration, and background electrolyte (seawater and NaClO4 solution) on the speciation of uranium(VI) associated with the marine bacterium Idiomarina loihiensis MAH1. This was done at the molecular level using a multidisciplinary approach combining X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS), Time-Resolved Laser-Induced Fluorescence Spectroscopy (TRLFS), and High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM). We showed that the U(VI)/bacterium interaction mechanism is highly dependent upon pH but also the nature of the used background electrolyte played a role. At neutral conditions and a U concentration ranging from 5·10(-4) to 10(-5) M (environmentally relevant concentrations), XAS analysis revealed that uranyl phosphate mineral phases, structurally resembling meta-autunite [Ca(UO2)2(PO4)2 2-6H2O] are precipitated at the cell surfaces of the strain MAH1. The formation of this mineral phase is independent of the background solution but U(VI) luminescence lifetime analyses demonstrated that the U(VI) speciation in seawater samples is more intricate, i.e., different complexes were formed under natural conditions. At acidic conditions, pH 2, 3 and 4.3 ([U] = 5·10(-4) M, background electrolyte = 0.1 M NaClO4), the removal of U from solution was due to biosorption to Extracellular Polysaccharides (EPS) and cell wall components as evident from TEM analysis. The LIII-edge XAS and TRLFS studies showed that the biosorption process observed is dependent of pH. The bacterial cell forms a complex with U through organic phosphate groups at pH 2 and via phosphate and carboxyl groups at pH 3 and 4.3, respectively. The differences in the complexes formed between uranium and bacteria on seawater compared to NaClO4 solution demonstrates that the actinide/microbe interactions are influenced by the three studied factors, i.e., the pH, the uranium concentration and the chemical composition of the solution."
https://openalex.org/W1997412038,"Despite the clinical success of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) therapy, toxicity is frequent. Therefore, it would be useful to identify predictors of adverse effects. In the last years, several studies have investigated the relationship between genetic variation and treatment-related toxicity. However, most of these studies are focused in coding regions. Nowadays, it is known that regions that do not codify proteins, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), may have an important regulatory function. MiRNAs can regulate the expression of genes affecting drug response. In fact, the expression of some of those miRNAs has been associated with drug response. Genetic variations affecting miRNAs can modify their function, which may lead to drug sensitivity. The aim of this study was to detect new toxicity markers in pediatric B-ALL, studying miRNA-related polymorphisms, which can affect miRNA levels and function. We analyzed 118 SNPs in pre-miRNAs and miRNA processing genes in association with toxicity in 152 pediatric B-ALL patients all treated with the same protocol (LAL/SHOP). Among the results found, we detected for the first time an association between rs639174 in DROSHA and vomits that remained statistically significant after FDR correction. DROSHA had been associated with alterations in miRNAs expression, which could affect genes involved in drug transport. This suggests that miRNA-related SNPs could be a useful tool for toxicity prediction in pediatric B-ALL."

Fungal infection of silkworm, Bombyx mori, may induce a variety of responsive reaction. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of silkworm immune response against the fungal infection. To obtain an overview of the interaction between silkworm and an entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana, Digital Gene Expression profiling, a tag based high-throughput transcriptome sequencing method, was employed to screen and identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs, FDR≤0.001, ∣log2ratio∣≥1) of silkworm larvae during early response against B. bassiana infection. Total 1430 DEGs including 960 up-regulated and 470 down-regulated ones were identified, of which 627 DEGs can be classified into GO categories by Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. KEGG pathways analysis of these DEGs suggested that many biological processes, such as defense and response, signal transduction, phagocytosis, regulation of gene expression, RNA splicing, biosynthesis and metabolism, protein transport etc. were involved in the interaction between the silkworm and B. bassiana. A number of differentially expressed fungal genes were also identified by mapping the sequencing tags to B. bassiana genome. These results provided new insights to the molecular mechanism of silkworm immune response to B. bassiana infection."

In this sense NCX3 plays a key role in neuronal excitotoxicity and Ca2+ extrusion during skeletal muscle relaxation. Alternative splicing generates two variants (NCX3-AC and NCX3-B). Here, we demonstrated that NCX3 variants display a tissue-specific distribution in mice, with NCX3-B as mostly expressed in brain and NCX-AC as predominant in skeletal muscle. Using Fura-2-based Ca2+ imaging, we measured the capacity and regulation of the two variants during Ca2+ extrusion and uptake in different conditions. Functional studies revealed that, although both variants are activated by intracellular sodium ([Na+]i), NCX3-AC has a higher [Na+]i sensitivity, as Ca2+ influx is observed in the presence of extracellular Na+. This effect could be partially mimicked for NCX3-B by mutating several glutamate residues in its cytoplasmic loop. In addition, NCX3-AC displayed a higher capacity of both Ca2+ extrusion and uptake compared with NCX3-B, together with an increased sensitivity to intracellular Ca2+. Strikingly, substitution of Glu580 in NCX3-B with its NCX3-AC equivalent Lys580 recapitulated the functional properties of NCX3-AC regarding Ca2+ sensitivity, Lys580 presumably acting through a structure stabilization of the Ca2+ binding site.

The crystal structure of the core fragment from Ser-39 to Met-738 of B. circulans T-3040 cycloisomaltooligosaccharide glucanotransferase, devoid of its N-terminal signal peptide and C-terminal nonconserved regions, was determined. The structural model contained one catalytic (β/α)8-barrel domain and three β-domains. Domain N with an immunoglobulin-like β-sandwich fold was attached to the N terminus; domain C with a Greek key β-sandwich fold was located at the C terminus, and a carbohydrate-binding module family 35 (CBM35) β-jellyroll domain B was inserted between the 7th β-strand and the 7th α-helix of the catalytic domain A. The structures of the inactive catalytic nucleophile mutant enzyme complexed with isomaltohexaose, isomaltoheptaose, isomaltooctaose, and cycloisomaltooctaose revealed that the ligands bound in the catalytic cleft and the sugar-binding site of CBM35. Of these, isomaltooctaose bound in the catalytic site extended to the second sugar-binding site of CBM35, which acted as subsite -8, representing the enzyme·substrate complex when the enzyme produces cycloisomaltooctaose. The isomaltoheptaose and cycloisomaltooctaose bound in the catalytic cleft with a circular structure around Met-310, representing the enzyme·product complex. These structures collectively indicated that CBM35 functions in determining the size of the product, causing the predominant production of cycloisomaltooctaose by the enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W2062977301,"Stroke is a major cause of death and disability, with very limited treatment option. Cell-based therapies have emerged as potential treatments for stroke. Indeed, studies have shown that transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) exerts functional benefits in stroke models. However, graft survival and integration with the host remain pressing concerns with cell-based treatments. The current study set out to investigate those very issues using a human NSC line, NSI-566RSC, in a rat model of ischemic stroke induced by transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. Seven days after stroke surgery, those animals that showed significant motor and neurological impairments were randomly assigned to receive NSI-566RSC intracerebral transplants at two sites within the striatum at three different doses: group A (0 cells/µl), group B (5,000 cells/µl), group C (10,000 cells/µl), and group D (20,000 cells/µl). Weekly behavioral tests, starting at seven days and continued up to 8 weeks after transplantation, revealed dose-dependent recovery from both motor and neurological deficits in transplanted stroke animals. Eight weeks after cell transplantation, immunohistochemical investigations via hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed infarct size was similar across all groups. To identify the cell graft, and estimate volume, immunohistochemistry was performed using two human-specific antibodies: one to detect all human nuclei (HuNu), and another to detect human neuron-specific enolase (hNSE). Surviving cell grafts were confirmed in 10/10 animals of group B, 9/10 group C, and 9/10 in group D. hNSE and HuNu staining revealed similar graft volume estimates in transplanted stroke animals. hNSE-immunoreactive fibers were also present within the corpus callosum, coursing in parallel with host tracts, suggesting a propensity to follow established neuroanatomical features. Despite absence of reduction in infarct volume, NSI-566RSC transplantation produced behavioral improvements possibly via robust engraftment and neuronal differentiation, supporting the use of this NSC line for stroke therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2072142498,"Comparative Gene Identification-58 (CGI-58), a lipid droplet (LD)-associated protein, promotes intracellular triglyceride (TG) hydrolysis in vitro. Mutations in human CGI-58 cause TG accumulation in numerous tissues including intestine. Enterocytes are thought not to store TG-rich LDs, but a fatty meal does induce temporary cytosolic accumulation of LDs. Accumulated LDs are eventually cleared out, implying existence of TG hydrolytic machinery in enterocytes. However, identities of proteins responsible for LD-TG hydrolysis remain unknown. Here we report that intestine-specific inactivation of CGI-58 in mice significantly reduces postprandial plasma TG concentrations and intestinal TG hydrolase activity, which is associated with a 4-fold increase in intestinal TG content and large cytosolic LD accumulation in absorptive enterocytes during the fasting state. Intestine-specific CGI-58 knockout mice also display mild yet significant decreases in intestinal fatty acid absorption and oxidation. Surprisingly, inactivation of CGI-58 in intestine significantly raises plasma and intestinal cholesterol, and reduces hepatic cholesterol, without altering intestinal cholesterol absorption and fecal neutral sterol excretion. In conclusion, intestinal CGI-58 is required for efficient postprandial lipoprotein-TG secretion and for maintaining hepatic and plasma lipid homeostasis. Our animal model will serve as a valuable tool to further define how intestinal fat metabolism influences the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2030929732,"Investments at the organismal level towards reproduction and growth are often used as indicators of health. Understanding how such energy allocation varies with environmental conditions may, therefore, aid in predicting possible responses to global climatic change in the near future. For example, variations in seawater temperature may alter the physiological functioning, behavior, reproductive output and demographic traits (e.g., productivity) of marine organisms, leading to shifts in the structure, spatial range, and abundance of populations. This study investigated variations in reproductive output associated with local seawater temperature along a wide latitudinal gradient on the western Italian coast, in the zooxanthellate Mediterranean coral, Balanophyllia europaea. Reproductive potential varied significantly among sites, where B. europaea individuals from the warmest site experienced loss of oocytes during gametogenesis. Most of the early oocytes from warmest sites did not reach maturity, possibly due to inhibition of metabolic processes at high temperatures, causing B. europaea to reabsorb the oocytes and utilize them as energy for other vital functions. In a progressively warming Mediterranean, the efficiency of the energy invested in reproduction could be considerably reduced in this species, thereby affecting vital processes. Given the projected increase in seawater temperature as a consequence of global climate change, the present study adds evidence to the threats posed by high temperatures to the survival of B. europaea in the next decades."

To explore whether the T-synthase encodes a specific recognition motif for Cosmc, we used deletion mutagenesis to identify a cryptic linear and relatively hydrophobic peptide in the N-terminal stem region of the T-synthase that is essential for binding to Cosmc (Cosmc binding region within T-synthase, or CBRT). Using this sequence information, we synthesized a peptide containing CBRT and found that it directly interacts with Cosmc and also inhibits Cosmc-assisted in vitro refolding of denatured T-synthase. Moreover, engineered T-synthase carrying mutations within CBRT exhibited diminished binding to Cosmc that resulted in the formation of inactive T-synthase. To confirm the general recognition of CBRT by Cosmc, we performed a domain swap experiment in which we inserted the stem region of the T-synthase into the human β4GalT1 and found that the CBRT element can confer Cosmc binding onto the β4GalT1 chimera. Thus, CBRT is a unique recognition motif for Cosmc to promote its regulation and formation of active T-synthase and represents the first sequence-specific chaperone recognition system in the ER/Golgi required for normal protein O-glycosylation. Prior studies suggested that the core 1 β3-galactosyltransferase (T-synthase) is a specific client of the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone Cosmc, whose function is required for T-synthase folding, activity, and consequent synthesis of normal O-glycans in all vertebrate cells.

https://openalex.org/W2043581353,"The brain-enriched microtubule-associated protein tau, a critical regulator of cytoskeletal dynamics, forms insoluble aggregates in a number of neurodegenerative diseases termed tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hyperphosphorylation of tau protein is an important mechanism for aggregation, so many studies on the pathogenesis of AD and other tauopathies have focused on regulation of tau phosphorylation by kinases and phosphatases. Less studied are mechanisms of tau transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation by extracellular signals such as BDNF and how such changes alter neuronal function. Previously, we reported that tau is required for morphological plasticity induced by BDNF. Here, we further explore tau modification during BDNF-induced changes in neuronal cell morphology. In undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells lacking neurites, tau formed a sphere within the soma as revealed by immunocytochemistry. In contrast, tau was enriched in the neurites and sparse in the soma of SH-SY5Y cells induced to differentiate by retinoic acid (RA). Treatment with RA also increased total tau protein levels but decreased expression of tau phosphorylated at Ser262 as determined by Western blot. Both effects were further enhanced by subsequent BDNF treatment. Upregulation of tau protein and downregulation of p-Ser262 tau were correlated with total neurite length (R = .94 and R = −.98, respectively). When primary E18 hippocampal neurons were treated with nocodazole, a blocker of microtubule polymerization, nascent neurites were lost and tau shifted to the soma. This process of retrograde tau movement away from neurites was reversed by BDNF. These results indicate that tau is redistributed to neurites and dephosphorylated during RA- and BDNF-mediated differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1964021249,"Pyranose dehydrogenase (PDH), a member of the GMC family of flavoproteins, shows a very broad sugar substrate specificity but is limited to a narrow range of electron acceptors and reacts extremely slowly with dioxygen as acceptor. The use of substituted quinones or (organo)metals as electron acceptors is undesirable for many production processes, especially of food ingredients. To improve the oxygen reactivity, site-saturation mutagenesis libraries of twelve amino acids around the active site of Agaricus meleagris PDH were expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We established high-throughput screening assays for oxygen reactivity and standard dehydrogenase activity using an indirect Amplex Red/horseradish peroxidase and a DCIP/D-glucose based approach. The low number of active clones confirmed the catalytic role of H512 and H556. Only one position was found to display increased oxygen reactivity. Histidine 103, carrying the covalently linked FAD cofactor in the wild-type, was substituted by tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan and methionine. Variant H103Y was produced in Pichia pastoris and characterized and revealed a five-fold increase of the oxygen reactivity."
https://openalex.org/W1963622453,"Tibial muscular dystrophy (TMD) is a late onset, autosomal dominant distal myopathy that results from mutations in the two last domains of titin. The cascade of molecular events leading from the causative Titin mutations to the preterm death of muscle cells in TMD is largely unknown. In this study we examined the mRNA and protein changes associated with the myopathology of TMD. To identify these components we performed gene expression profiling using muscle biopsies from TMD patients and healthy controls. The profiling results were confirmed through quantitative real-time PCR and protein level analysis. One of the pathways identified was activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. ER stress activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway. UPR activation was supported by elevation of the marker genes HSPA5, ERN1 and the UPR specific XBP1 splice form. However, UPR activation appears to be insufficient to correct the protein abnormalities causing its activation because degenerative TMD muscle fibres show an increase in ubiquitinated protein inclusions. Abnormalities of VCP-associated degradation pathways are also suggested by the presence of proteolytic VCP fragments in western blotting, and VCP's accumulation within rimmed vacuoles in TMD muscle fibres together with p62 and LC3B positive autophagosomes. Thus, pathways controlling turnover and degradation, including autophagy, are distorted and lead to degeneration and loss of muscle fibres."
https://openalex.org/W2164780252,"From climatology to biofluidics, the characterization of complex flows relies on computationally expensive kinematic and kinetic measurements. In addition, such big data are difficult to handle in real time, thereby hampering advancements in the area of flow control and distributed sensing. Here, we propose a novel framework for unsupervised characterization of flow patterns through nonlinear manifold learning. Specifically, we apply the isometric feature mapping (Isomap) to experimental video data of the wake past a circular cylinder from steady to turbulent flows. Without direct velocity measurements, we show that manifold topology is intrinsically related to flow regime and that Isomap global coordinates can unravel salient flow features."
https://openalex.org/W2037950066,"There is increased interest in immune-based monoclonal antibody therapies for different malignancies because of their potential specificity and limited toxicity. The activity of some therapeutic monoclonal antibodies is partially dependent on complement-dependent cytolysis (CDC), in which the immune system surveys for invading pathogens, infected cells, and malignant cells and facilitates their destruction. CD59 is a ubiquitously expressed cell-surface glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein that protects cells from CDC. However, in certain tumors, CD59 expression is enhanced, posing a significant obstacle for treatment, by hindering effective monoclonal antibody-induced CDC. In this study, we used non-small lung carcinoma cells to characterize the mechanism of a novel CD59 inhibitor: the 114-amino acid recombinant form of the 4th domain of intermedilysin (rILYd4), a pore forming toxin secreted by Streptococcus intermedius. We compared the rates of internalization of CD59 in the presence of rILYd4 or anti-CD59 antibodies and determined that rILYd4 induces more rapid CD59 uptake at early time points. Most significantly, upon binding to rILYd4, CD59 is internalized and undergoes massive degradation in lysosomes within minutes. The remaining rILYd4·CD59 complexes recycle to the PM and are shed from the cell. In comparison, upon internalization of CD59 via anti-CD59 antibody binding, the antibody·CD59 complex is recycled via early and recycling endosomes, mostly avoiding degradation. Our study supports a novel role for rILYd4 in promoting internalization and rapid degradation of the complement inhibitor CD59, and highlights the potential for improving CDC-based immunotherapy.

https://openalex.org/W2072873387,"Bisphosphonates (BPs) have been widely used in clinical treatment of bone diseases with increased bone resorption because of their strong affinity for bone and their inhibition of bone resorption. Recently, there has been growing interest in their improvement of bone formation. However, the effect of local controlled delivery of BPs is unclear. We used polylactide acid-glycolic acid copolymer (PLGA) as a drug carrier to deliver various doses of the bisphosphonate zoledronate (Zol) into the distal femur of 8-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats. After 6 weeks, samples were harvested and analyzed by micro-CT and histology. The average bone mineral density and mineralized bone volume fraction were higher with medium- and high-dose PLGA-Zol (30 and 300 µg Zol, respectively) than control and low-dose Zol (3 µg PLGA-Zol; p<0.05). Local controlled delivery of Zol decreased the numbers of osteoclast and increased the numbers of osteoblast. Moreover, local controlled delivery of medium- and high-dose Zol accelerated the expression of bone-formation markers. PLGA used as a drug carrier for controlled delivery of Zol may promote local bone formation."

The relevance of TREX1 structure and biochemistry to nucleic acid-mediated disease prompted the studies presented here to better understand the relationships between TREX1 mutation and disease phenotype. In addition to Arg-114, the TREX1 structure reveals residues positioned at the dimer interface such as Arg-62 that have not yet been identified as positions of disease-causing mutations but might contribute to enzyme activity through inter-protomer coordination (26.de Silva U.

The studies here test the hypothesis that the conserved TREX1 Arg-62 residues extend across the dimer interface and contribute to catalysis in the active site of the opposing protomer specifically through DNA binding. The activities of TREX1 R62A-containing homodimers, heterodimers, and compound heterodimers were compared with TREX1WT using quantitative ss- and dsDNA degradation assays. The DNA degradation activities and DNA binding measured in the TREX1 R62A-containing mutants demonstrate that Arg-62 from one TREX1 protomer contributes to DNA degradation in the opposing protomer. These results show that the mechanism of the TREX1 Arg-62 “across the dimer interface” contribution is through DNA binding in the opposing protomer.

In this study, 25 upregulated proteins were identified using 2D electrophoresis (2-DE) coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). These proteins were involved in (i) PCB degradation (i.e., 3-chlorobenzoate-3,4-dioxygenase); (ii) transport processes [e.g., ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter substrate-binding protein, amino acid ABC transporter substrate-binding protein, peptide ABC transporter substrate-binding protein, putrescine-binding protein, periplasmic solute-binding protein, branched-chain amino acid uptake periplasmic solute-binding protein, periplasmic phosphate-binding protein, phosphonate ABC transporter substrate-binding protein, and xylose ABC transporter substrate-binding protein]; (iii) energetic metabolism (e.g., methanol/ethanol family pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-dependent dehydrogenase, malate-CoA ligase subunit beta, enolase, ATP synthase β subunit, FOF1 ATP synthase subunit beta, ATP synthase α subunit, and IMP cyclohydrolase); (iv) electron transport (cytochrome b6f complex Fe-S protein); (v) general stress response (e.g., molecular chaperone DnaK, elongation factor G, and translation elongation factor thermostable); (vi) carbon metabolism (methanol dehydrogenase and malate-CoA ligase subunit beta); and (vii) nitrogen reductase (nitrous oxide reductase). The results of real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that the genes encoding for dioxygenase, ABC transporters, transmembrane proteins, electron transporter, and energetic metabolism proteins were significantly upregulated during PCB degradation. These genes upregulated by 1.26- to 8.98-fold. These findings reveal the resistance and adaptation of cyanobacterium to the presence of PCBs, shedding light on the complexity of PCB catabolism by Anabaena PD-1."

The neural stem cells were isolated from cerebrums of embryonic day 14 CD1 mice. The proliferation of cells was monitored using the cell counting kit-8 assay, bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and cell cycle analysis. Cell migration and differentiation were investigated with the neurosphere assay and cell specific markers, respectively. The results showed that Nardosinone promotes cells proliferation and increases cells migration distance in a dose-dependent manner. Nardosinone also induces the selective differentiation of neural stem cells to neurons and oligodendrocytes, as indicated by the expression of microtubule-associated protein-2 and myelin basic protein, respectively. Nardosinone also increases the expression of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase and phospho-cAMP response element binding protein during proliferation and differentiation. In conclusion, this study reveals the regulatory effects of Nardosinone on neural stem cells, which may have significant implications for the treatment of brain injury and neurodegenerative diseases."

However, there was no assessment of the spatial learning and memory abilities in chronic rotenone-induced PD models. In the present study, by rotarod test and Thioflavine T staining, we first noted the impairment of motor coordination in rotenone-treated group for 3 months, as well as alpha-synuclein inclusions in the nigral dopaminergic neurons in C57BL/6 mice with intragastrical delivery of rotenone (5 mg/Kg) for 3 months rather than 1 month. We then evaluated spatial learning and memory abilities by Morris water maze task in this model. The results showed escape latency reduced in rotenone-intoxicated mice for 3 months, indicating an improvement of learning ability. However, it was delayed slightly but not significantly in rotenone-intoxicated mice for 1 month. Similarly, we demonstrated that spatial memory ability was enhanced in 3-month-treatment group, but impaired in 1-month-treatment group. There were no proliferating cell nuclear antigen and doublecortin positive cells in the hippocampus by double immunofluorescent staining, indicating the absence of hippocampal neurogenesis in rotenone-intoxicated mice. These results suggest that spatial learning and memory abilities are disturbed in chronic rotenone-intoxicated PD model."
https://openalex.org/W2069687733,"The Drosophila Groucho protein and its mammalian orthologues the transducin-like enhancers of split (TLEs) are critical transcriptional corepressors that repress Wnt and other signaling pathways. Although it is known that Groucho/TLEs are recruited to target genes by pathway-specific transcription factors, molecular events after the corepressor recruitment are largely unclear. We report that association of TLEs with O-GlcNAc transferase, an enzyme that catalyzes posttranslational modification of proteins by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine, is essential for TLE-mediated transcriptional repression. Removal of O-GlcNAc from Wnt-responsive gene promoters is critical for gene activation from Wnt-responsive promoters. Thus, these studies identify a molecular mechanism by which Groucho/TLEs repress gene transcription and provide a model whereby O-GlcNAc may control distinct intracellular signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1979302439,"UL16 binding proteins (ULBPs) are a family of cell surface proteins that are present in transformed and stressed cells and ligands for NKG2D. Soluble NKG2D ligands have been found in sera from cancer patients with their protein concentrations correlated with poor cancer prognosis. Here we show, for the first time, that human tumor cells lost their surface expression of ULBP2, but not ULBP1 and ULBP3, during NK cell-mediated cytolysis. In contrast to spontaneous shedding of NKG2D ligands, NK cytolysis-mediated shedding of ULBP2 was linked to target cell apoptosis, although both resulted from metalloproteinase cleavages. Inhibition of ULBP2 shedding by a metalloproteinase inhibitor BB-94 lead to reduced NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and cytokine production. These results illustrate a regulation of NK cell effector functions through cytolysis-induced NKG2D ligand shedding. Consequently, compounds inhibiting NKG2D ligand shedding may offer therapeutic means to reduce excessive pathogenic NK cell activities."

The blast results were then analyzed with in-house Python scripts. An empirical formula was proposed to identify the putative pathogens. Results showed that not only viruses but also prokaryotic and eukaryotic species of interest can be screened out and were subsequently confirmed with experiments. Specially, a novel Rickettsia spp. was indicated to exist in Haemaphysalis longicornis ticks collected in Beijing. Our study demonstrated the reuse of sRNA deep sequencing data would have the potential to trace the origin of pathogens or discover novel agents of emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2093953878,"The Burkholderia species utilize acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate, substrates for citrate synthase in the TCA cycle, to produce oxalic acid in response to bacterial cell to cell communication, called quorum sensing. Quorum sensing-mediated oxalogenesis via a sequential reaction by ObcA and ObcB counteracts the population-collapsing alkaline pH of the stationary growth phase. Thus, the oxalic acid produced plays an essential role as an excreted public good for survival of the group. Here, we report structural and functional analyses of ObcA, revealing mechanistic features distinct from those of citrate synthase. ObcA exhibits a unique fold, in which a (β/α)8-barrel fold is located in the C-domain with the N-domain inserted into a loop following α1 in the barrel fold. Structural analyses of the complexes with oxaloacetate and with a bisubstrate adduct indicate that each of the oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA substrates is bound to an independent site near the metal coordination shell in the barrel fold. In catalysis, oxaloacetate serves as a nucleophile by forming an enolate intermediate mediated by Tyr(322) as a general base, which then attacks the thioester carbonyl carbon of acetyl-CoA to yield a tetrahedral adduct between the two substrates. Therefore, ObcA catalyzes its reaction by combining the enolase and acetyltransferase superfamilies, but the presence of the metal coordination shell and the absence of general acid(s) produces an unusual tetrahedral CoA adduct as a stable product. These results provide the structural basis for understanding the first step in oxalogenesis and constitute an example of the functional diversity of an enzyme for survival and adaptation in the environment."

Weight gain measurement during anti tuberculosis (TB) treatment period is an important component to assess the progress of TB patients. In this study, Latent Growth Models (LGMs) were implemented in a longitudinal design to predict the change in weight of TB patients who were given three different regimens under randomized controlled clinical trial for anti-TB treatment. Linear and Quadratic LGMs were fitted using Mplus software. The age, sex and treatment response of the TB patients were used as time invariant independent variables of the growth trajectories. The quadratic trend was found to be better in explaining the changes in weight without grouping than the quadratic model for three group comparisons. A significant increase in the change of weight over time was identified while a significant quadratic effect indicated that weights were sustained over time. The growth rate was similar in both the groups. The treament response had significant association with the growth rate of weight scores of the patients."

https://openalex.org/W2085622010,"Intracellular protein trafficking through secretory and endocytic pathways depends on the function of adaptor proteins that bind motifs on cargo proteins. The adaptor proteins then recruit coat proteins such as clathrin, enabling the formation of a transport vesicle. While studying the role of the clathrin adaptor proteins, AP-1, AP-2 and AP-3 in viral protein trafficking, we discovered that AP-1 and AP-3 potentially have a role in successful transfection of mammalian cells with DNA-liposome complexes (lipoplexes). We showed that AP-1, -2 and -3 are not required for lipoplexes to enter cells, but that lipoplexes and/or released DNA are unable to reach the nucleus in the absence of AP-1 or AP-3, leading to minimal exogenous gene expression. In contrast, gene expression from liposome-delivered mRNA, which does not require nuclear entry, was not impaired by the absence of AP-1 or AP-3. Despite the use of lipoplexes to mediate gene delivery being so widely used in cell biology and, more recently, gene therapy, the mechanism by which lipoplexes or DNA reach the nucleus is poorly characterised. This work sheds light on the components involved in this process, and demonstrates a novel role for AP-1 and AP-3 in trafficking lipoplexes."
