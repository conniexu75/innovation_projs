https://openalex.org/W4225095275,"Although circumstantial evidence supports enhanced Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) signalling as a mechanism of human systemic autoimmune disease1-7, evidence of lupus-causing TLR7 gene variants is lacking. Here we describe human systemic lupus erythematosus caused by a TLR7 gain-of-function variant. TLR7 is a sensor of viral RNA8,9 and binds to guanosine10-12. We identified a de novo, previously undescribed missense TLR7Y264H variant in a child with severe lupus and additional variants in other patients with lupus. The TLR7Y264H variant selectively increased sensing of guanosine and 2',3'-cGMP10-12, and was sufficient to cause lupus when introduced into mice. We show that enhanced TLR7 signalling drives aberrant survival of B cell receptor (BCR)-activated B cells, and in a cell-intrinsic manner, accumulation of CD11c+ age-associated B cells and germinal centre B cells. Follicular and extrafollicular helper T cells were also increased but these phenotypes were cell-extrinsic. Deficiency of MyD88 (an adaptor protein downstream of TLR7) rescued autoimmunity, aberrant B cell survival, and all cellular and serological phenotypes. Despite prominent spontaneous germinal-centre formation in Tlr7Y264H mice, autoimmunity was not ameliorated by germinal-centre deficiency, suggesting an extrafollicular origin of pathogenic B cells. We establish the importance of TLR7 and guanosine-containing self-ligands for human lupus pathogenesis, which paves the way for therapeutic TLR7 or MyD88 inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W4225090134,"Abstract Comprehensive assessments of species’ extinction risks have documented the extinction crisis 1 and underpinned strategies for reducing those risks 2 . Global assessments reveal that, among tetrapods, 40.7% of amphibians, 25.4% of mammals and 13.6% of birds are threatened with extinction 3 . Because global assessments have been lacking, reptiles have been omitted from conservation-prioritization analyses that encompass other tetrapods 4–7 . Reptiles are unusually diverse in arid regions, suggesting that they may have different conservation needs 6 . Here we provide a comprehensive extinction-risk assessment of reptiles and show that at least 1,829 out of 10,196 species (21.1%) are threatened—confirming a previous extrapolation 8 and representing 15.6 billion years of phylogenetic diversity. Reptiles are threatened by the same major factors that threaten other tetrapods—agriculture, logging, urban development and invasive species—although the threat posed by climate change remains uncertain. Reptiles inhabiting forests, where these threats are strongest, are more threatened than those in arid habitats, contrary to our prediction. Birds, mammals and amphibians are unexpectedly good surrogates for the conservation of reptiles, although threatened reptiles with the smallest ranges tend to be isolated from other threatened tetrapods. Although some reptiles—including most species of crocodiles and turtles—require urgent, targeted action to prevent extinctions, efforts to protect other tetrapods, such as habitat preservation and control of trade and invasive species, will probably also benefit many reptiles."
https://openalex.org/W4229074905,"The superconducting analogue to the semiconducting diode, the Josephson diode, has long been sought with multiple avenues to realization being proposed by theorists1-3. Showing magnetic-field-free, single-directional superconductivity with Josephson coupling, it would serve as the building block for next-generation superconducting circuit technology. Here we realized the Josephson diode by fabricating an inversion symmetry breaking van der Waals heterostructure of NbSe2/Nb3Br8/NbSe2. We demonstrate that even without a magnetic field, the junction can be superconducting with a positive current while being resistive with a negative current. The ΔIc behaviour (the difference between positive and negative critical currents) with magnetic field is symmetric and Josephson coupling is proved through the Fraunhofer pattern. Also, stable half-wave rectification of a square-wave excitation was achieved with a very low switching current density, high rectification ratio and high robustness. This non-reciprocal behaviour strongly violates the known Josephson relations and opens the door to discover new mechanisms and physical phenomena through integration of quantum materials with Josephson junctions, and provides new avenues for superconducting quantum devices."
https://openalex.org/W4225091982,"Atherosclerotic plaques develop in the inner intimal layer of arteries and can cause heart attacks and strokes1. As plaques lack innervation, the effects of neuronal control on atherosclerosis remain unclear. However, the immune system responds to plaques by forming leukocyte infiltrates in the outer connective tissue coat of arteries (the adventitia)2-6. Here, because the peripheral nervous system uses the adventitia as its principal conduit to reach distant targets7-9, we postulated that the peripheral nervous system may directly interact with diseased arteries. Unexpectedly, widespread neuroimmune cardiovascular interfaces (NICIs) arose in mouse and human atherosclerosis-diseased adventitia segments showed expanded axon networks, including growth cones at axon endings near immune cells and media smooth muscle cells. Mouse NICIs established a structural artery-brain circuit (ABC): abdominal adventitia nociceptive afferents10-14 entered the central nervous system through spinal cord T6-T13 dorsal root ganglia and were traced to higher brain regions, including the parabrachial and central amygdala neurons; and sympathetic efferent neurons projected from medullary and hypothalamic neurons to the adventitia through spinal intermediolateral neurons and both coeliac and sympathetic chain ganglia. Moreover, ABC peripheral nervous system components were activated: splenic sympathetic and coeliac vagus nerve activities increased in parallel to disease progression, whereas coeliac ganglionectomy led to the disintegration of adventitial NICIs, reduced disease progression and enhanced plaque stability. Thus, the peripheral nervous system uses NICIs to assemble a structural ABC, and therapeutic intervention in the ABC attenuates atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W4225004582,"For centuries, scientists have explored the limits of biological jump height1,2, and for decades, engineers have designed jumping machines3-18 that often mimicked or took inspiration from biological jumpers. Despite these efforts, general analyses are missing that compare the energetics of biological and engineered jumpers across scale. Here we show how biological and engineered jumpers have key differences in their jump energetics. The jump height of a biological jumper is limited by the work its linear motor (muscle) can produce in a single stroke. By contrast, the jump height of an engineered device can be far greater because its ratcheted or rotary motor can 'multiply work' during repeated strokes or rotations. As a consequence of these differences in energy production, biological and engineered jumpers should have divergent designs for maximizing jump height. Following these insights, we created a device that can jump over 30 metres high, to our knowledge far higher than previous engineered jumpers and over an order of magnitude higher than the best biological jumpers. Our work advances the understanding of jumping, shows a new level of performance, and underscores the importance of considering the differences between engineered and biological systems."
https://openalex.org/W4225090137,"Abstract The development of catalytic chemical processes that enable the revalorization of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) is an attractive strategy to alleviate the environmental threat posed by its emissions 1–6 . Traditionally, N 2 O has been considered an inert molecule, intractable for organic chemists as an oxidant or O-atom transfer reagent, owing to the harsh conditions required for its activation (&gt;150 °C, 50‒200 bar) 7–11 . Here we report an insertion of N 2 O into a Ni‒C bond under mild conditions (room temperature, 1.5–2 bar N 2 O), thus delivering valuable phenols and releasing benign N 2 . This fundamentally distinct organometallic C‒O bond-forming step differs from the current strategies based on reductive elimination and enables an alternative catalytic approach for the conversion of aryl halides to phenols. The process was rendered catalytic by means of a bipyridine-based ligands for the Ni centre. The method is robust, mild and highly selective, able to accommodate base-sensitive functionalities as well as permitting phenol synthesis from densely functionalized aryl halides. Although this protocol does not provide a solution to the mitigation of N 2 O emissions, it represents a reactivity blueprint for the mild revalorization of abundant N 2 O as an O source."
https://openalex.org/W4225089663,"Proteasomal degradation of ubiquitylated proteins is tightly regulated at multiple levels1-3. A primary regulatory checkpoint is the removal of ubiquitin chains from substrates by the deubiquitylating enzyme ubiquitin-specific protease 14 (USP14), which reversibly binds the proteasome and confers the ability to edit and reject substrates. How USP14 is activated and regulates proteasome function remain unknown4-7. Here we present high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures of human USP14 in complex with the 26S proteasome in 13 distinct conformational states captured during degradation of polyubiquitylated proteins. Time-resolved cryo-electron microscopy analysis of the conformational continuum revealed two parallel pathways of proteasome state transitions induced by USP14, and captured transient conversion of substrate-engaged intermediates into substrate-inhibited intermediates. On the substrate-engaged pathway, ubiquitin-dependent activation of USP14 allosterically reprograms the conformational landscape of the AAA-ATPase motor and stimulates opening of the core particle gate8-10, enabling observation of a near-complete cycle of asymmetric ATP hydrolysis around the ATPase ring during processive substrate unfolding. Dynamic USP14-ATPase interactions decouple the ATPase activity from RPN11-catalysed deubiquitylation11-13 and kinetically introduce three regulatory checkpoints on the proteasome, at the steps of ubiquitin recognition, substrate translocation initiation and ubiquitin chain recycling. These findings provide insights into the complete functional cycle of the USP14-regulated proteasome and establish mechanistic foundations for the discovery of USP14-targeted therapies."
https://openalex.org/W4225100560,"Post-transcriptional modifications have critical roles in tRNA stability and function1-4. In thermophiles, tRNAs are heavily modified to maintain their thermal stability under extreme growth temperatures5,6. Here we identified 2'-phosphouridine (Up) at position 47 of tRNAs from thermophilic archaea. Up47 confers thermal stability and nuclease resistance to tRNAs. Atomic structures of native archaeal tRNA showed a unique metastable core structure stabilized by Up47. The 2'-phosphate of Up47 protrudes from the tRNA core and prevents backbone rotation during thermal denaturation. In addition, we identified the arkI gene, which encodes an archaeal RNA kinase responsible for Up47 formation. Structural studies showed that ArkI has a non-canonical kinase motif surrounded by a positively charged patch for tRNA binding. A knockout strain of arkI grew slowly at high temperatures and exhibited a synthetic growth defect when a second tRNA-modifying enzyme was depleted. We also identified an archaeal homologue of KptA as an eraser that efficiently dephosphorylates Up47 in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our findings show that Up47 is a reversible RNA modification mediated by ArkI and KptA that fine-tunes the structural rigidity of tRNAs under extreme environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4224981068,"As the chemical industry continues to produce considerable quantities of waste chemicals1,2, it is essential to devise 'circular chemistry'3-8 schemes to productively back-convert at least a portion of these unwanted materials into useful products. Despite substantial progress in the degradation of some classes of harmful chemicals9, work on 'closing the circle'-transforming waste substrates into valuable products-remains fragmented and focused on well known areas10-15. Comprehensive analyses of which valuable products are synthesizable from diverse chemical wastes are difficult because even small sets of waste substrates can, within few steps, generate millions of putative products, each synthesizable by multiple routes forming densely connected networks. Tracing all such syntheses and selecting those that also meet criteria of process and 'green' chemistries is, arguably, beyond the cognition of human chemists. Here we show how computers equipped with broad synthetic knowledge can help address this challenge. Using the forward-synthesis Allchemy platform16, we generate giant synthetic networks emanating from approximately 200 waste chemicals recycled on commercial scales, retrieve from these networks tens of thousands of routes leading to approximately 300 important drugs and agrochemicals, and algorithmically rank these syntheses according to the accepted metrics of sustainable chemistry17-19. Several of these routes we validate by experiment, including an industrially realistic demonstration on a 'pharmacy on demand' flow-chemistry platform20. Wide adoption of computerized waste-to-valuable algorithms can accelerate productive reuse of chemicals that would otherwise incur storage or disposal costs, or even pose environmental hazards."
https://openalex.org/W4225082853,"The Solar System's orbital structure is thought to have been sculpted by an episode of dynamical instability among the giant planets1-4. However, the instability trigger and timing have not been clearly established5-9. Hydrodynamical modelling has shown that while the Sun's gaseous protoplanetary disk was present the giant planets migrated into a compact orbital configuration in a chain of resonances2,10. Here we use dynamical simulations to show that the giant planets' instability was probably triggered by the dispersal of the gaseous disk. As the disk evaporated from the inside out, its inner edge swept successively across and dynamically perturbed each planet's orbit in turn. The associated orbital shift caused a dynamical compression of the exterior part of the system, ultimately triggering instability. The final orbits of our simulated systems match those of the Solar System for a viable range of astrophysical parameters. The giant planet instability therefore took place as the gaseous disk dissipated, constrained by astronomical observations to be a few to ten million years after the birth of the Solar System11. Terrestrial planet formation would not complete until after such an early giant planet instability12,13; the growing terrestrial planets may even have been sculpted by its perturbations, explaining the small mass of Mars relative to Earth14."
https://openalex.org/W4225099662,"Quantum phases can be classified by topological invariants, which take on discrete values capturing global information about the quantum state1-13. Over the past decades, these invariants have come to play a central role in describing matter, providing the foundation for understanding superfluids5, magnets6,7, the quantum Hall effect3,8, topological insulators9,10, Weyl semimetals11-13 and other phenomena. Here we report an unusual linking-number (knot theory) invariant associated with loops of electronic band crossings in a mirror-symmetric ferromagnet14-20. Using state-of-the-art spectroscopic methods, we directly observe three intertwined degeneracy loops in the material's three-torus, T3, bulk Brillouin zone. We find that each loop links each other loop twice. Through systematic spectroscopic investigation of this linked-loop quantum state, we explicitly draw its link diagram and conclude, in analogy with knot theory, that it exhibits the linking number (2, 2, 2), providing a direct determination of the invariant structure from the experimental data. We further predict and observe, on the surface of our samples, Seifert boundary states protected by the bulk linked loops, suggestive of a remarkable Seifert bulk-boundary correspondence. Our observation of a quantum loop link motivates the application of knot theory to the exploration of magnetic and superconducting quantum matter."

https://openalex.org/W4225518059,"During the summer of 2021, a narrative of ""two Americas"" emerged: one with high demand for the COVID-19 vaccine and the second with widespread vaccine hesitancy and opposition to masks and vaccines. We analyzed “excess mortality” rates (the difference between total deaths and what would have been expected based on earlier time periods) prepared by the CDC for the United States from January 3, 2020 to September 26, 2021. Between Jan. 3, 2020 and Sept. 26, 2021, there were 895,693 excess deaths associated with COVID-19, 26% more than reported as such. The proportion of deaths estimated by the excess mortality method that was reported as COVID-19 was highest in the Northeast (92%) and lowest in the West (72%) and South (76%). Of the estimated deaths, 43% occurred between Oct. 4, 2020 and Feb. 27, 2021. Before May 31, 2020, approximately 56% of deaths were in the Northeast, where 17% of the population resides. Subsequently, 48% of deaths were in the South, which makes up 38% of the population. Since May 31, 2020, the South experienced COVID-19 mortality 26% higher than the national rate, whereas the Northeast’s rate was 42% lower. If each region had the same mortality rate as the Northeast, more than 316,234 COVID-19 deaths between May 31, 2020 and Sept. 26, 2021 were ""avoidable."" More than half (63%) of the avoidable deaths occurred between May 31, 2020 and February, 2021, and more than half (60%) were in the South. Regional differences in COVID-19 mortality have been strong throughout the pandemic. The South has had higher mortality rates than the rest of the U.S. since May 31, 2020, and experienced 62% of the avoidable deaths. A comprehensive COVID-19 policy, including population-based restrictions as well as vaccines, is needed to control the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4224996695,"Psoriasis is an inflammatory disorder characterized by keratinocyte hyper-proliferation and Th17-type immune responses. However, the roles of bioactive lipids and the regulation of their biosynthesis in this chronic skin disease are not fully understood. Herein, we show that group IVE cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2 ε/PLA2G4E) plays a counterregulatory role against psoriatic inflammation by producing the anti-inflammatory lipid N-acylethanolamine (NAE). Lipidomics analysis of mouse skin revealed that NAE species and their precursors (N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine and glycerophospho-N-acylethanolamine) were robustly increased in parallel with the ongoing process of imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis, accompanied by a marked upregulation of cPLA2 ε in epidermal keratinocytes. Genetic deletion of cPLA2 ε exacerbated IMQ-induced ear swelling and psoriatic marker expression, with a dramatic reduction of NAE-related lipids in IMQ-treated, and even normal, skin. Stimulation of cultured human keratinocytes with psoriatic cytokines concomitantly increased PLA2G4E expression and NAE production, and supplementation with NAEs significantly attenuated the cytokine-induced upregulation of the psoriatic marker S100A9. Increased expression of cPLA2 ε was also evident in the epidermis of psoriatic patients. These findings reveal for the first time the in vivo role of cPLA2 ε, which is highly induced in the keratinocytes of the psoriatic skin, promotes the biosynthesis of NAE-related lipids, and contributes to limiting psoriatic inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W4225093788,"As the human population and demand for food grow1, the ocean will be called on to provide increasing amounts of seafood. Although fisheries reforms and advances in offshore aquaculture (hereafter 'mariculture') could increase production2, the true future of seafood depends on human responses to climate change3. Here we investigated whether coordinated reforms in fisheries and mariculture could increase seafood production per capita under climate change. We find that climate-adaptive fisheries reforms will be necessary but insufficient to maintain global seafood production per capita, even with aggressive reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions. However, the potential for sustainable mariculture to increase seafood per capita is vast and could increase seafood production per capita under all but the most severe emissions scenario. These increases are contingent on fisheries reforms, continued advances in feed technology and the establishment of effective mariculture governance and best practices. Furthermore, dramatically curbing emissions is essential for reducing inequities, increasing reform efficacy and mitigating risks unaccounted for in our analysis. Although climate change will challenge the ocean's ability to meet growing food demands, the ocean could produce more food than it does currently through swift and ambitious action to reduce emissions, reform capture fisheries and expand sustainable mariculture operations."
https://openalex.org/W4224988720,"Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have a potentially serious effect on mental health and increase the risk of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorders in people. In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of psychological illness and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Libyan population’s mental health. Method A cross-sectional survey, conducted in both online and paper modes and consisting of five sections, was completed in more than 30 cities and towns across Libya. The first section consisted of questions on basic demographic characteristics. The second section contained a survey related to the lockdown status, activities, related stress levels, and quarantine. The third section comprised the self-administered 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The fourth section contained the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and the fifth section contained the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Result Of the 31,557 respondents, 4,280 (13.6%) reported severe depressive symptoms, with a mean [standard deviation (SD)] PHQ-9 score of 8.32 (5.44); 1,767 (5.6%) reported severe anxiety symptoms, with a mean (SD) GAD-7 score of 6 (4.6); and 6,245 (19.8%) of the respondents reported post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with a mean (SD) score of 15.3 (18.85). In multivariate analysis, young age, being female, unmarried, educated, or victims of domestic violence or abuse, work suspension during the pandemic, and having increased workload, financial issues, suicidal thoughts, or a family member with or hospitalized due to COVID-19 were significantly associated with a high likelihood of depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as PTSD. Internal displacement due to civil war was also associated with PTSD. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze the psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and civil war in Libya. Further study on the development of strategies and interventions aimed at reducing the mental disease burden on the Libyan population is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W4224981081,"The relative age effect (RAE) is a statistical bias observed across sport contexts and consists of a systematic skewness in birth date distribution within an annual-age cohort. In soccer, January 1st is the common cut-off date when categorizing players in competitions according to their chronological age, which potentially disadvantages those within the cohort who were born later in the year. Thus, relatively older soccer players in their cohort can be favored in talent identification, selection, and development. The aim of the current study was to investigate the variations in RAE in male and female international youth world-cup tournaments (U17 and U20) in the period from 1997-2019 and in international senior world-cup-tournaments from 2006-2019. A total of 20,401 soccer players participating in 47 different tournaments were analyzed. The birthdate distributions were categorized into four quartiles (January-March, Q1; April-June, Q2; July-September, Q3; October-December, Q4) and compared to a uniform distribution using Chi-square analysis with Cramer's V (Vc) as a measure of effect size. Based on the existing data concerning RAE in elite junior and senior soccer, it was hypothesized that: (I) the RAE is present in youth soccer world cup tournaments but is stronger in male players than in female players; (II) the younger the soccer players, the stronger the RAE; and (III) the RAE in world cup soccer tournaments has strengthened over time. All these hypotheses were supported by the data; novel findings included that the effect has now entered women's soccer, and in men's soccer it persists into senior world cup tournaments. Thus, a strong RAE bias occurs in selection among elite soccer players competing in international world cup tournaments."
https://openalex.org/W4225985297,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal malignancies. A growing number of studies have shown that competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory networks might play important roles during HCC process. The present study aimed to identify a regulatory axis of the ceRNA network associated with the development of HCC. The roles of SNX16 and PAPOLG in HCC were comprehensively analyzed using bioinformatics tools. Subsequently, the ""mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA"" model was then used to predict the upstream miRNAs and lncRNAs of SNX16 and PAPOLG using the miRNet database, and the miRNAs with low expression and good prognosis in HCC and the lncRNAs with high expression and poor prognosis in HCC were screened by differential expression and survival analysis. Finally, the risk-prognosis models of ceRNA network axes were constructed by univariate and multifactorial Cox proportional risk analysis, and the immune correlations of ceRNA network axes were analyzed using the TIMER and GEPIA database. In this study, the relevant ceRNA network axis GSEC/miR-101-3p/SNX16/PAPOLG with HCC prognosis was constructed, in which GSEC, SNX16, and PAPOLG were highly expressed in HCC with poor prognosis, while miR-101-3p was lowly expressed in HCC with good prognosis. The risk-prognosis model predicted AUC of 0.691, 0.623, and 0.626 for patient survival at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Immuno-infiltration analysis suggested that the GSEC/miR-101-3p/SNX16/PAPOLG axis might affect macrophage polarization. The GSEC/miR-101-3p/SNX16/PAPOLG axis of the ceRNA network axis might be an important factor associated with HCC prognosis and immune infiltration."
https://openalex.org/W4226508883,"Using region-industry panel data for Chile over the period 1985 to 2017, we find no effect of precipitation changes on GDP and a negative impact of higher summer temperatures on Agriculture-Silviculture and Fishing. An increase of one Celsius degree in the month of January implies a 3% and 12% GDP reduction in Agriculture and Fishing, respectively. There is also a negative effect of higher temperatures in January on Construction and Electricity, Gas, and Water. Our analysis suggests that climate change did not have a big impact on the Chilean economy during this period. Stress test exercises that select only the negative and statistically significant coefficients imply that the Chilean GDP would fall between -14.8% and -9% in 2050 and between -29.6% and -16.8% in 2100, according to our model."
https://openalex.org/W4225515515,"15-40% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harbor epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-sensitizing mutations. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) provide significant clinical benefit in this population, yet all patients will ultimately progress. Liquid biopsy can reliably identify somatic tumor-associated EGFR mutations in plasma. This study aimed to assess the feasibility and value of the quantitative assessment of EGFR driver mutations in plasma in EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients treated with EGFR-TKIs as a tool to evaluate therapeutic response to TKIs and monitor for disease progression. The study included 136 patients with tissue biopsy-confirmed EGFR-sensitizing, mutation-positive lung adenocarcinoma with plasma collected prior to TKI treatment and at least two post-initiation TKI treatment/follow-up blood samples. Plasma samples were tested with the cobas® EGFR Mutation Test v2 (cobas EGFR Test), and semi-quantitative index (SQI) values for each identified mutation were reported by the assay software. The most common baseline EGFR mutations detected in tissue were L858R (53.7%) and exon 19 deletion (39.7%). Plasma cell-free DNA analysis detected EGFR mutations in 74% of the baseline samples. Objective response rate by RECIST 1.1 was achieved in 72% of patients, while 93% had a molecular response (defined as disappearance of the EGFR mutation from plasma). 83% of patients had molecular progression (MP; 1.5X SQI increase or new T790M mutation), and 82% who had a clinical response had clinical progression. On average, MP occurred 42 days prior to clinical progression. Patients who progressed while on first-line TKI showed MP of the original EGFR-sensitizing mutations prior to the emergence of a T790M mutation, which was detected in 27% of the EGFR plasma-positive patients. Longitudinal monitoring of EGFR mutational load in plasma is feasible and can predict both response and clinical progression in EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients treated with EGFR-TKIs, as well as detect treatment-emergent EGFR mutations."
https://openalex.org/W4226265173,"Pathological examination is the gold standard for breast cancer diagnosis. The recognition of histopathological images of breast cancer has attracted a lot of attention in the field of medical image processing. In this paper, on the base of the Bioimaging 2015 dataset, a two-stage nuclei segmentation strategy, that is, a method of watershed segmentation based on histopathological images after stain separation, is proposed to make the dataset recognized to be the carcinoma and non-carcinoma recognition. Firstly, stain separation is performed on breast cancer histopathological images. Then the marker-based watershed segmentation method is used for images obtained from stain separation to achieve the nuclei segmentation target. Next, the completed local binary pattern is used to extract texture features from the nuclei regions (images after nuclei segmentation), and color features were extracted by using the color auto-correlation method on the stain-separated images. Finally, the two kinds of features were fused and the support vector machine was used for carcinoma and non-carcinoma recognition. The experimental results show that the two-stage nuclei segmentation strategy proposed in this paper has significant advantages in the recognition of carcinoma and non-carcinoma on breast cancer histopathological images, and the recognition accuracy arrives at 91.67%. The proposed method is also applied to the ICIAR 2018 dataset to realize the automatic recognition of carcinoma and non-carcinoma, and the recognition accuracy arrives at 92.50%."
https://openalex.org/W4225006954,"With the tendency toward economic and strategy decoupling between China and the United States and amidst the anti-globalization trend, enterprises are facing unprecedented challenges and opportunities. In this study, we reveal how the agile intuition (AI) of top managers with respect to the external environment affects enterprise innovation behavior (IB) based on the cognition–behavior framework. Strategic learning (SL) is considered a moderator, and knowledge sharing (KS) is considered a mediator. The survey sample consists of 305 managers from 47 enterprises in China during the COVID-19 period. The empirical results show that top management agile intuition significantly promotes enterprise IB; knowledge sharing (KS) partially mediates the relationship between top manager AI and enterprise IB; and SL suppresses the promotion effect of top manager AI on enterprise IB to a certain extent, hindering blind innovation. In a surprising result, we find that strategic guidance by an external consultant does not significantly affect the enterprise IB in China."
https://openalex.org/W4225011145,"Quercus mongolica Fisch. ex Ledeb is the main species of coniferous and broadleaved mixed forests in northeast and north China, which has high ornamental, economic, and ecological value. The appropriate reference genes must be selected for quantitative real-time PCR to reveal the molecular mechanisms of stress responses and their contribution to breeding of Q. mongolica. In the present study, we chose 11 candidate reference genes (TUA, CYP18, HIS4, RPS13, ACT97, TUB1, UBQ10, UBC5, SAND, PP2A, and SAMDC) and used four programs (GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder) to assess the expression stability of the above genes in roots, stems, and leaves under five abiotic stress factors (cold, salt, drought, weak light, and heavy metal). The findings revealed that under various experimental environments, the most stable genes were different; CYP18, ACT97, and RPS13 ranked the highest under most experimental environments. Moreover, two genes induced by stress, CMO and P5CS2, were chosen to demonstrate the reliability of the selected reference genes in various tissues under various stress conditions. Our research provides a significant basis for subsequent gene function studies of Q. mongolica."
https://openalex.org/W4225616065,"Background Although blood transfusion is an intervention that saves lives, it poses significant risks to the blood receivers, including the transmission of bloodborne pathogens. We aimed at determining the prevalence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B virus (HBV), and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) in candidates approved for blood donation, and in samples considered to be negative in reference blood banks in Mozambique. Methods A cross-sectional study was performed between November 2014 and October 2015 in Maputo and Beira cities. Demographic information was obtained from all consenting blood donors using a structured questionnaire. Plasma samples were screened for HIVAb/Ag combinations, HBsAg and Anti-HCV. Blood donors considered to be negative by serological testing were re-tested in pools of six plasma samples using nucleic acid testing (NAT). Results Most blood donors were male 2,320 (83.4%) with an age range of 18 to 34 years. The overall seroprevalence of HIV, HBV and HCV infections among blood donors approved for donation was 4.6% (127; 95% CI 3.8–5.4), 4.5% (124; 95% CI 3.7–5.3) and 0.4% (11; 95% CI 0.2–0.7), respectively. The overall frequency by NAT of HIV RNA, HBV DNA, and HCV RNA in serologically negative blood donor samples was 2.6 per 1000 blood donors (7; 95% CI 1.1–5.4); 12.5 per 1000 blood donors (33; 95% CI 8.6–17.5) and 2.6 per 1000 blood donors (6; 95% CI 1.0–5.7), respectively. Conclusion Our results show high seroprevalence of HIV and HBV infections in blood donors approved for donation, and high frequency of molecular biomarkers of HIV, HBV, and HCV in blood considered to be safe. These results suggest the need for a new blood screening policy in Mozambique, including the use of NAT to detect infectious blood donations during the immunologically negative window."
https://openalex.org/W4225616459,"The continued influence effect of misinformation (CIE) is a phenomenon in which certain information, although retracted and corrected, still has an impact on event reporting, reasoning, inference, and decisions. The main goal of this paper is to investigate to what extent this effect can be reduced using the procedure of inoculation and how it can be moderated by the reliability of corrections' sources. The results show that the reliability of corrections' sources did not affect their processing when participants were not inoculated. However, inoculated participants relied on misinformation less when the correction came from a highly credible source. For this source condition, as a result of inoculation, a significant increase in belief in retraction, as well as a decrease in belief in misinformation was also found. Contrary to previous reports, belief in misinformation rather than belief in retraction predicted reliance on misinformation. These findings are of both great practical importance as certain boundary conditions for inoculation efficiency have been discovered to reduce the impact of the continued influence of misinformation, and theoretical, as they provide insight into the mechanisms behind CIE. The results were interpreted in terms of existing CIE theories as well as within the remembering framework, which describes the conversion from memory traces to behavioral manifestations of memory."
https://openalex.org/W4226112573,"Introduction Remdesivir and Dexamethasone represent the cornerstone of therapy for critically ill patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure caused by Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, clinical efficacy and safety of concomitant administration of Remdesivir and Dexamethasone (Rem-Dexa) in severe COVID-19 patients on high flow oxygen therapy (HFOT) or non-invasive ventilation (NIV) remains unknown. Materials and methods Prospective cohort study that was performed in two medical Intensive Care Units (ICUs) of a tertiary university hospital. The clinical impact of Rem-Dexa administration in hypoxemic patients with COVID-19, who required NIV or HFOT and selected on the simplified acute physiology score II, the sequential organ failure assessment score and the Charlson Comorbidity Index score, was investigated. The primary outcome was 28-day intubation rate; secondary outcomes were end-of-treatment clinical improvement and PaO2/FiO2 ratio, laboratory abnormalities and clinical complications, ICU and hospital length of stay, 28-day and 90-day mortality. Results We included 132 patients and found that 28-day intubation rate was significantly lower among Rem-Dexa group (19.7% vs 48.5%, p &lt;0.01). Although the end-of-treatment clinical improvement was larger among Rem-Dexa group (69.7% vs 51.5%, p = 0.05), the 28-day and 90-day mortalities were similar (4.5% and 10.6% vs. 15.2% and 16.7%; p = 0.08 and p = 0.45, respectively). The logistic regression and Cox-regression models showed that concomitant Rem-Dexa therapy was associated with a reduction of 28-day intubation rate (OR 0.22, CI95% 0.05–0.94, p = 0.04), in absence of laboratory abnormalities and clinical complications ( p = ns). Conclusions In COVID-19 critically ill patients receiving HFO or NIV, 28-day intubation rate was lower in patients who received Rem-Dexa and this finding corresponded to lower end-of-treatment clinical improvement. The individual contribution of either Remdesevir or Dexamethasone to the observed clinical effect should be further investigated."
https://openalex.org/W4226145106,"Background Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a clinically heterogeneous disease with many acute and chronic complications driven by ongoing vaso-occlusion and hemolysis. It causes a disproportionate burden on Black and Hispanic communities. Our objective was to follow the SMDM/ISPOR Task Force recommendations for good practices and create a conceptual model of the progression of SCD under current clinical practice to inform cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) of promising curative therapies in the pipeline over a lifetime horizon. Methods We used consultations with experts, providers, and patients to identify acute events and chronic conditions in the conceptual model. We compared our model structure to previous CEA models of interventions for SCD, assessed the prevalence of the identified disease attributes in Medicaid and Medicare claims databases, and identified relevant outcomes following the 2 nd Panel in CEA. We determined an appropriate modeling technique and relevant data sources for parameterizing the model. Results The conceptual model structure included four dimensions of disease: chronic pain, acute events, chronic conditions, and treatment complications, spanning 26 disease attributes with significant impacts on health-related quality of life and resource. We modeled chronic pain separately to reflect its importance to patients and interaction with all other disease attributes. We identified additional data sources for health state utilities and non-medical costs and benefits of SCD. We will use a microsimulation model with age- and sex-specific transitions between health states predicted by patient demographic characteristics and disease history. Conclusion Developing the model structure through an explicit process of model conceptualization can increase the transparency and accuracy of results. We will populate the conceptual model with the data sources described and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of curative therapies."
https://openalex.org/W4224989493,"The spatially-coded SSVEP BCI exploits changes in the topography of the steady-state visual evoked response to visual flicker stimulation in the extrafoveal field of view. In contrast to frequency-coded SSVEP BCIs, the operator does not gaze into any flickering lights; therefore, this paradigm can reduce visual fatigue. Other advantages include high classification accuracies and a simplified stimulation setup. Previous studies of the paradigm used stimulation intervals of a fixed duration. For frequency-coded SSVEP BCIs, it has been shown that dynamically adjusting the trial duration can increase the system's information transfer rate (ITR). We therefore investigated whether a similar increase could be achieved for spatially-coded BCIs by applying dynamic stopping methods. To this end we introduced a new stopping criterion which combines the likelihood of the classification result and its stability across larger data windows. Whereas the BCI achieved an average ITR of 28.4±6.4 bits/min with fixed intervals, dynamic intervals increased the performance to 81.1±44.4 bits/min. Users were able to maintain performance up to 60 minutes of continuous operation. We suggest that the dynamic response time might have worked as a kind of temporal feedback which allowed operators to optimize their brain signals and compensate fatigue."
https://openalex.org/W4225469604,"Morphological changes in the upper airway and the resulting alteration in the nasal respiratory function after jawbone repositioning during orthognathic surgery have garnered attention recently. In particular, nasopharyngeal stenosis, because of the complex influence of both jaws, the effects of which have not yet been clarified owing to postero-superior repositioning of the maxilla, may significantly impact sleep and respiratory function, necessitating further functional evaluation. This study aimed to perform a functional evaluation of the effects of surgery involving maxillary repositioning, which may result in a larger airway resistance if the stenosis worsens the respiratory function, using CFD for treatment planning. A model was developed from CT images obtained preoperatively (PRE) and postoperatively (POST) in females (n = 3) who underwent maxillary postero-superior repositioning using Mimics and ICEM CFD. Simultaneously, a model of stenosis (STENOSIS) was developed by adjusting the severity of stenosis around the PNS to simulate greater repositioning than that in the POST. Inhalation at rest and atmospheric pressure were simulated in each model using Fluent, whereas pressure drop (ΔP) was evaluated using CFD Post. In this study, ΔP was proportional to airway resistance because the flow rate was constant. Therefore, the magnitude of ΔP was evaluated as the level of airway resistance. The ΔP in the airway was lower in the POST compared to the PRE, indicating that the analysis of the effects of repositioning on nasal ventilation showed that current surgery is appropriate with respect to functionality, as it does not compromise respiratory function. The rate of change in the cross-sectional area of the mass extending pharynx (α) was calculated as the ratio of each neighboring section. The closer the α-value is to 1, the smaller the ΔP, so ideally the airway should be constant. This study identified airway shapes that are favorable from the perspective of fluid dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W4225543956,"Sall4 encodes a transcription factor and is known to participate in the pluripotency network of embryonic stem cells. Sall4 expression is known to be high in early stage post-implantation mouse embryos. During early post-gastrulation stages, Sall4 is highly expressed in the tail bud and distal limb buds, where progenitor cells are maintained in an undifferentiated status. The expression of Sall4 is rapidly downregulated during embryonic development. We previously demonstrated that Sall4 is required for limb and posterior axial skeleton development by conditional deletion of Sall4 in the T (Brachyury) lineage. To gain insight into Sall4 functions in embryonic development and postnatal digit regeneration, we genetically overexpressed Sall4 in the mesodermal lineage by the TCre transgene and a novel knockin allele of Rosa26-loxP-stop-loxP-Sall4. In significant contrast to severe defects by Sall4 loss of function reported in previous studies, overexpression of Sall4 resulted in normal morphology and pattern in embryos and neonates. The length of limb long bones showed subtle reduction in Sall4-overexpression mice. It is known that the digit tip of neonatal mice has level-specific regenerative ability after experimental amputation. We observed Sall4 expression in the digit tip by using a sensitive Sall4-LacZ knock-in reporter expression. Sall4 overexpression did not alter the regenerative ability of the terminal phalange that normally regenerates after amputation. Moreover, Sall4 overexpression did not confer regenerative ability to the second phalange that normally does not regenerate after amputation. These genetic experiments show that overexpression of Sall4 does not alter the development of the appendicular and axial skeleton, or neonatal digit regeneration. The results suggest that Sall4 acts as a permissive factor rather than playing an instructive role."
https://openalex.org/W4226133730,"Sharing and reuse biosamples can facilitate biomedical research. Little is known about researchers' perception and practice about sharing, reusing, and storing biosamples in Jordan. Therefore, the current study aimed to evaluate the practices of biomedical researchers in Jordan regarding biosamples management.The study was cross-sectional and involved biomedical researchers from different parts of Jordan. A questionnaire was designed to achieve the aim of this study. The questionnaire was web-based and distributed via e-mails using Google forms.Opinions of Jordanian biomedical researchers from different academic ranks and institutional backgrounds were measured and recorded anonymously. The majority of the sample was males (57.9%), from public universities (64.3%), and (64.6%) were from health-related fields. About 82.9% of participants stored biosamples using codes, whereas the rest used the subject's name. Sharing of biosamples was commonly practiced by 61.7% of Jordanian researchers locally, while 47.2% of the Jordanian researchers shared biosamples overseas. The reuse of biosamples in other projects was reported to be 55.4%. The majority explained the possibility of reusing and sharing biosamples in the consent form (range: 53-58%). Sharing and reusing biosamples were associated with gender, the number of publications in peer-reviewed international journals, and academic rank (P<0.05).Sharing and reusing biosamples are common among Jordanian biomedical researchers. Therefore, ethically grounded biosamples sharing and reuse standards are essential for protecting human subjects' rights and privacy in Jordan."
https://openalex.org/W4226153195,"Background Geographic and contextual socioeconomic risk factors in adolescence may be more strongly associated with young adult hypertension than individual-level risk factors. This study examines the association between individual, neighborhood, and school-level influences during adolescence on young adult blood pressure. Methods Data were analyzed from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (1994–1995 aged 11–18 and 2007–2008 aged 24–32). We categorized hypertension as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg. Secondary outcomes included continuous systolic and diastolic blood pressure. We fit a series of cross-classified multilevel models to estimate the associations between young adulthood hypertension with individual-level, school-level, and neighborhood-level factors during adolescence (i.e., fixed effects) and variance attributable to each level (i.e., random effects). Models were fit using Bayesian estimation procedures. For linear models, intra-class correlations (ICC) are reported for random effects. Results The final sample included 13,911 participants in 128 schools and 1,917 neighborhoods. Approximately 51% (7,111) young adults were hypertensive. Individual-level characteristics—particularly older ages, Non-Hispanic Black race, Asian race, male sex, BMI, and current smoking—were associated with increased hypertension. Non-Hispanic Black (OR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.03–1.42) and Asian (OR = 1.28; 95% CI: 1.02–1.62) students had higher odds of hypertension compared to non-Hispanic White students. At the school level, hypertension was associated with the percentage of non-Hispanic White students (OR for 10% higher = 1.06; 95% CI: 1.01–1.09). Adjusting for individual, school, and neighborhood predictors attenuated the ICC for both the school (from 1.4 null to 0.9 fully-adjusted) and neighborhood (from 0.4 to 0.3). Conclusion We find that adolescents’ schools and individual-level factors influence young adult hypertension, more than neighborhoods. Unequal conditions in school environments for adolescents may increase the risk of hypertension later in life. Our findings merit further research to better understand the mechanisms through which adolescents’ school environments contribute to adult hypertension and disparities in hypertension outcomes later in life."
https://openalex.org/W4226170910,"Rare disease clinical trials are constrained to small sample sizes and may lack placebo-control, leading to challenges in drug development. This paper proposes a Bayesian model-based framework for early go/no-go decision making in rare disease drug development, using Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) as an example. Early go/no-go decisions were based on projections of long-term functional outcomes from a Bayesian model-based analysis of short-term trial data informed by prior knowledge based on 6MWT natural history literature data in DMD patients. Frequentist hypothesis tests were also applied as a reference analysis method. A number of combinations of hypothetical trial designs, drug effects and cohort comparison methods were assessed. The proposed Bayesian model-based framework was superior to the frequentist method for making go/no-go decisions across all trial designs and cohort comparison methods in DMD. The average decision accuracy rates across all trial designs for the Bayesian and frequentist analysis methods were 45.8 and 8.98%, respectively. A decision accuracy rate of at least 50% was achieved for 42 and 7% of the trial designs under the Bayesian and frequentist analysis methods, respectively. The frequentist method was limited to the short-term trial data only, while the Bayesian methods were informed with both the short-term data and prior information. The specific results of the DMD case study were limited due to incomplete specification of individual-specific covariates in the natural history literature data and should be reevaluated using a full natural history dataset. These limitations aside, the framework presented provides a proof of concept for the utility of Bayesian model-based methods for decision making in rare disease trials."
https://openalex.org/W4226458482,"Quantifying the impact of disruptions on rapid transit resilience is crucial in transport planning. We propose a composite resilience score for rapid transit systems comprising four indicators that measure different physical aspects of resilience. These are computed using a weighted network model incorporating the network structure of stations, differences in line capacities, and travel demand. Our method provides a holistic assessment of network resilience and allows for straightforward comparisons of different scenarios including rail expansions and changes in demand. Applying our methodology to multiple configurations of Singapore's rapid transit system, we demonstrate its effectiveness in capturing the impact of planned future lines. We also showcase through simulated studies how tipping points in resilience arise when demand varies. Furthermore, we demonstrate that system resilience could be unintentionally reduced by redistributing commuting demand to peripheral areas. Our methodology is easily applied to other rapid transit systems around the world."

https://openalex.org/W4225014826,"Scenic resources can serve as symbols of a region’s natural resources and culture and are often the stimulus for the development of national parks. Thus, careful scientific planning and effective management based on the identification and evaluation of scenic resources are key for the sustainable development of national parks. In this study, one object-oriented and three pixel-based (maximum likelihood classification, neural network, and support vector machine) classification methods were applied to identify scenic resources in Yesanpo National Park using high-resolution Gaofen-2 images. The classification accuracy of these scenic resources was evaluated through systematic sampling, which improved the objectivity and accuracy of the classification precision evaluation. All methods met the precision requirements of scenic resource identification, and the accuracy of object-oriented classification was the highest. The application scope of the different methods varies, and suitability can be determined according to the needs of scenic resource recognition. Collectively, this study has proposed an effective and practical method for the identification of scenic resources within Yesanpo National Park, which is of significance for its future planning and management. Moreover, this strategy can be applied by other national park planners to select areas for tourism development, formulate sustainable development strategies, and provide technical support and decision-making guidance for national park planning and management."
https://openalex.org/W4226092234,"Understanding how a human cell reacts to external physical stimuli is essential to understanding why vibration can elicit localized pain reduction. Stimulation of epithelial cells with external vibration forces has been shown to change cell shape, particularly in regards to structures involved in non-muscle cell motility. We hypothesized that epithelial cells respond to vibration transduction by altering proteins involved in remodeling cytoskeleton. Epithelial cells were exposed to vibration and assessed by microscopy, cytoskeletal staining, immunoblotting and quantitative RT-PCR. Here, we report that epithelial cell lines exposed to 15 minutes of vibration retract filopodia and concentrate actin at the periphery of the cell. In particular, we show an increased expression of the calcium-dependent, cysteine protease, calpain. The discovery that cell transitions are induced by limited exposure to natural forces, such as vibration, provides a foundation to explain how vibrational treatment helps migraine patients."
https://openalex.org/W4226149197,"The approximate number system (a) views number as an imprecise signal that (b) functions equivalently regardless of a number's initial presentation. These features do not readily account for exact readings when a task calls for them. While profiting from insights in areas neighboring the number cognition literature, we propose that linguistic-pragmatic and cultural pressures operate on a number's upper bound in order to provide exact readings. With respect to (a), Experimental Pragmatic findings indicate that numbers appear to be semantically lower-bounded (Eleven candidates are coming means at least eleven) but fluid at its upper-bound; exactly readings emerge as a consequence of an additional pragmatic process that solidifies the upper bound. With respect to (b), studies from cognitive anthropology underline how symbolic representations of number are distinct from written codes. Here, we investigate a novel hypothesis proposing that symbolic expressions of number (such as ""11"") explicitly provide exactly readings unlike verbal (oral and written) ones, which engender at least readings. We then employ a Numerical Magnitude Task (NMT), in which French-speaking participants determine whether a presented number is lesser or greater than a benchmark (12) in one of three presentation conditions: i) Symbolic/Hindu-Arabic (e.g. ""11"" via screen), ii) Oral (e.g. ""/'on.zə/"" via headphones), or; iii) spelled-out-in-Letters (e.g. ""onze"" via screen). Participants also carry out a Number Identification Task (NIT) so that each participant's recognition speed per number can be removed from their NMT times. We report that decision reaction times to ""onze"" take longer to process (and prompt more errors) than ""treize"" whereas ""11"" and ""13"" are comparable. One prediction was not supported: Decision times to the critical oral forms (""/'on.zə/"" and ""[tʁ̥ɛːzə̆]"") were comparable, making these outcomes resonate with those in the Symbolic condition."
https://openalex.org/W4226316625,"In vitro assays of angiogenesis face immense problems considering their reproducibility based on the inhomogeneous characters of endothelial cells (ECs). It is necessary to detect influencing factors, which affect the angiogenic potency of ECs.This study aimed to analyse expression profiles of vimentin (VIM), triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) and adenosylmethionine synthetase isoform type-2 (MAT2A) during the whole angiogenic cascade in vitro. Furthermore, the impact of knocking down vimentin (VIM) on angiogenesis in vitro was evaluated, while monitoring TPI and MAT2A expression.A long-term cultivation and angiogenic stimulation of human dermal microvascular ECs was performed. Cells were characterized via VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 expression and a shRNA-mediated knockdown of VIM was performed. The process of angiogenesis in vitro was quantified via morphological staging and mRNA-and protein-levels of all proteins were analysed.While native cells ran through the angiogenic cascade chronologically, knockdown cells only entered beginning stages of angiogenesis and died eventually. Cell cultures showing a higher VEGFR-1 expression survived exclusively and displayed an upregulation of MAT2A and TPI expression. Native cells highly expressed VIM in early stages, MAT2A mainly in the beginning and TPI during the course of angiogenesis in vitro.VIM knockdown led to a deceleration of angiogenesis in vitro and knockdown cells displayed expressional changes in TPI and MAT2A. Cell populations with a higher number of stalk cells emerged as being more stable against manipulations and native expression profiles provided an indication of VIM and MAT2A being relevant predominantly in beginning stages and TPI during the whole angiogenic cascade in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W4226349233,"Resiniferatoxin (RTX), an extract from the spurge plant Euphorbia resinifera, is a potent agonist of the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1), mainly expressed on peripheral nociceptors-a prerequisite for nociceptive heat perception. Systemic overdosing of RTX can be used to desensitize specifically TRPV1-expressing neurons, and was therefore utilized here to selectively characterize the influence of TRPV1-signaling on central nervous system (CNS) temperature processing. Resting state and CNS temperature processing of male rats were assessed via functional magnetic resonance imaging before and after RTX injection. General linear model-based and graph-theoretical network analyses disentangled the underlying distinct CNS circuitries. At baseline, rats displayed an increase of nociception-related response amplitude and activated brain volume that correlated highly with increasing stimulation temperatures. In contrast, RTX-treated rats showed a clear disruption of thermal nociception, reflected in a missing increase of CNS responses to temperatures above 48°C. Graph-theoretical analyses revealed two distinct brain subnetworks affected by RTX: one subcortical (brainstem, lateral and medial thalamus, hippocampus, basal ganglia and amygdala), and one cortical (primary sensory, motor and association cortices). Resting state analysis revealed first, that peripheral desensitization of TRPV1-expressing neurons did not disrupt the basic resting-state-network of the brain. Second, only at baseline, but not after RTX, noxious stimulation modulated the RS-network in regions associated with memory formation (e.g. hippocampus). Altogether, the combination of whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging and RTX-mediated desensitization of TRPV1-signaling provided further detailed insight into cerebral processing of noxious temperatures."

Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy has been associated with normalization of various soluble immune activation parameters. Whether the RF levels relate to soluble immune activation markers during chronic HCV infection, and over what time frame RF levels normalize during and after DAA treatment is unknown and was investigated here.In a longitudinal study, plasma and serum was obtained from HCV infected RF positive (RF+) and RF negative (RF-) participants. The levels of RF, HCV RNA and soluble markers of inflammation were determined before (week 0), during (weeks 4, 8 and 12) and after (week 24) treatment with HCV DAA therapy. In a subset of RF+ participants, the analysis was extended to over 70 weeks after therapy initiation. Hepatic and other clinical parameters were determined at baseline (week 0) in all participants.Before therapy, transient elastography (TE) score was greater in RF+ compared to RF- HCV infected participants, while the systemic levels of soluble inflammatory markers were comparable. Following DAA therapy initiation, HCV RNA levels became undetectable within 4 weeks in both the RF+ and RF- groups. RF levels declined in the first 6 months in most RF+ persons but most commonly remained positive. The levels of some soluble inflammatory markers declined, mainly within 4 weeks of DAA therapy start, in both the RF+ and RF- groups. The baseline (week 0) TE score correlated with RF levels before, during and after DAA therapy, while plasma IL-18 levels correlated with RF level after DAA therapy.During chronic HCV infection, TE score is elevated in RF+ HCV infected individuals and factors other than HCV viremia (including liver stiffness or fibrosis and select markers of inflammation) likely contribute to persistence of RF after treatment of HCV with DAA."

https://openalex.org/W4225010631,"Raptors are highly sensitive to environmental and human-induced changes. In addition, several species of raptors exist in considerably small numbers. It is thus critical to conserve raptors and their habitats across relatively larger landscapes. We examined the diurnal raptor assemblages and seasonality in a subtropical habitat in India's northwestern Himalayas. Quantitative data on diurnal birds of prey and their habitat features across six distinct habitat types were collected from 33 sample sites. We observed 3,434 individuals of 28 diurnal raptors belonging to two orders and three families during a two-year survey from December 2016 to November 2018. A significant variation in bird species richness and abundance was found across habitats and seasons, with farmlands and winters being the most diverse and speciose. The generalized linear model, used to determine raptor community responses, indicated that elevation and proximity to dumping sites significantly affected the raptor abundance. The non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) revealed significant differences in raptor assemblages across the habitat types. The study concluded that raptors' persistence is largely determined by their preference for favourable feeding, roosting, and nesting opportunities. The presence of protected and habitat-exclusive species validates the high conservation importance of these ecosystems, particularly the forest patches and farmlands, necessitating robust conservation and management measures in this part of northwestern Himalaya."

Therefore, the objective of this prospective single centre study was to establish an inexpensive, fast and accurate protocol for bacterial species identification with SDS protein-extraction directly from BacT/Alert ® blood culture (BC) bottles by VitekMS ® . Results Correct species identification was obtained for 198/266 (74.4%, 95%-CI = [68.8%, 79.6%]) of pathogens. The protocol was more successful in identifying 87/96 (91.4%, 95%-CI = [83.8%, 93.2%]) gram-negative bacteria than 110/167 (65.9%, 95%-CI = [58.1%, 73.0%]) gram-positive bacteria. The hands-on time for sample preparation and measurement was about 15 min for up to five samples. This is shorter than for most other protocols using a similar lysis-centrifugation approach for the combination of BacT/Alert ® BC bottles and the Vitek ® MS mass spectrometer. The estimated costs per sample were approx. 1.80€ which is much cheaper than for commercial kits. Conclusion This optimized protocol allows for accurate identification of bacteria directly from blood culture bottles for laboratories equipped with BacT/Alert ® blood culture bottles and VitekMS ® mass spectrometer."

There is little literature regarding CT myelogram (CTM) techniques in swine and morphometry in miniature swine has not been established. A CT-guided method for performing myelography as well as reference values for spinal morphometry in healthy Yucatan miniature swine is lacking. The goal of this study is to describe a CT-guided method of performing CTM in a porcine model of SCI and to establish spinal morphometric reference values in mature Yucatan pigs. Six healthy, Yucatan sows, 9 months of age, weighing between 39–57.7kg, with no history of spinal disease, spinal injury, or neurologic deficits on physical exam were used in this study. CT myelography was performed in each sow under general anesthesia. CT scout images were used to guide needle placement at the L3-L4 intervertebral site. Once correct needle placement was confirmed using a 1ml test injection, a full dose of iodinated contrast (0.3ml/kg) was injected slowly over a 2-minute time period. Morphometry was performed using area measurements of the spinal cord (SC), vertebral body (VB), dural sac (DS), and vertebral canal (VC) at the mid-body and the intervertebral disc space of each spinal segment. Of the quantitative measurements, the spinal cord surface area had the widest range of values and the greatest coefficient of variance (CV) while those parameters for the vertebral canal had a low CV. Of the morphometric ratios, the DS:VC, had the lowest CV while the spinal cord ratios to DS and VC had the highest (&gt;30). The vertebral canal surface area and the dural space: vertebral canal ratio may serve as reference values in future studies using this animal model."

Daily hospital COVID-19-related burden was also registered. A similar cohort from a period immediately before the lockdown was studied (pre-lockdown cohort) to compare appropriateness.454 endoscopy procedures were performed during the studied period, comprising a 49.7% reduction compared to the pre-lockdown cohort (n = 913). There was a significant increase in ESGE high-priority indications (62.1% vs. 45.6%, p<0.001) associated with an increase in relevant endoscopic findings (p = 0.006), advanced neoplasia/cancer (p = 0.004) and cancer detection rate (p = 0.010). There were no differences in the rate of admissions or infection among scheduled patients in the lockdown cohort. None of the staff members tested positive for COVID-19 in the 7 days after the adoption of protective measures.A prioritized endoscopic activity is not associated with higher contagion after adopting protective measures. In addition, a triage of procedures that follow the ESGE criteria increases the rate of relevant endoscopic findings. These considerations may reduce the impact of the delays of diagnosis after the pandemic."

However, the effect of season and time after kraal use (alt. age of nutrient enriched hotspots) on large herbivore use of these sites has not been examined. We collated the number of large herbivore sightings per day from camera traps during wet, early and late dry season in nutrient enriched hotspots of varying ages (1, 2, 3 and 4 years) and surrounding vegetation. In addition, above ground grass biomass and height in nutrient enriched hotspots was compared to that of the surrounding vegetation. Furthermore, we tested if repeated grazing in nutrient enriched hotspots stimulated grass compensatory growth. Large herbivore use of nutrient enriched hotspots was similar during wet, early and late dry season. Time after kraal use had a significant effect on mixed feeders (impala and African savanna elephant) utilization of nutrient enriched hotspots but not grazers (zebra and warthog) and browsers (giraffe and greater kudu). Both impala and African savanna elephants mostly used nutrient enriched hotspots one year after kraal use. Aboveground grass biomass and height were higher in surrounding vegetation than in nutrient enriched hotspots. Repeated clipping (proxy for grazing) resulted in compensatory aboveground grass biomass in nutrient enriched hotspots, which declined with time after kraal use. We concluded that nutrient enriched hotspots created through short duration overnight kraaling were important foraging sites for large herbivores."

However, one out of six surgical patients is undernourished during hospitalization and approximately half of the patients eat 50% or less of the food provided to them. We assessed the use of newly introduced breakfast buffets in two wards for gastrointestinal and oncological surgery and determined the impact on postoperative protein and energy intake.A prospective pilot cohort study was conducted to assess the impact of the introduction of breakfast buffets in two surgical wards. Adult patients had the opportunity to choose between an attractive breakfast buffet and regular bedside breakfast service. Primary outcomes were protein and energy intake during breakfast. We asked patients to report the type of breakfast service and breakfast intake in a diary over a seven-day period. Prognostic factors were used during multivariable regression analysis.A total of 77 patients were included. The median percentage of buffet use per patient during the seven-day study period was 50% (IQR 0-83). Mean protein intake was 14.7 g (SD 8.4) and mean energy intake 332.3 kcal (SD 156.9). Predictors for higher protein intake included the use of the breakfast buffet (β = 0.06, p = 0.01) and patient weight (β = 0.13, p = 0.01). Both use of the breakfast buffet (β = 1.00, p = 0.02) and Delirium Observation Scale scores (β = -246.29, p = 0.02) were related to higher energy intake.Introduction of a breakfast buffet on a surgical ward was associated with higher protein and energy intake and it could be a promising approach to optimizing such intake in surgical patients. Large, prospective and preferably randomized studies should confirm these findings."
https://openalex.org/W4226517746,"The paper investigates a leader-following scheme for nonlinear multi-agent systems (MASs). The network of agents involves time-delay, unknown leader's states, external perturbations, and switching graph topologies. Two distributed protocols including a consensus protocol and an observer are utilized to reconstruct the unavailable states of the leader in a network of agents. The H∞-based stability conditions for estimation and consensus problems are obtained in the framework of linear-matrix inequalities (LMIs) and the Lyapunov-Krasovskii approach. It is ensured that each agent achieves the leader-following agreement asymptotically. Moreover, the robustness of the control policy concerning a gain perturbation is guaranteed. Simulation results are performed to assess the suggested schemes. It is shown that the suggested approach gives a remarkable accuracy in the consensus problem and leader's states estimation in the presence of time-varying gain perturbations, time-delay, switching topology and disturbances. The H∞ and LMIs conditions are well satisfied and the error trajectories are well converged to the origin."
