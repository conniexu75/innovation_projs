https://openalex.org/W2154790710,"This report describes the identification of three molecularly distinct subtypes of pancreatic ductal adenocarninoma (PDA). The classical, quasimesenchymal and exocrine subtypes can further stratify tumors with the same genetic alterations, and could be useful to improve prognosis and predict treatment response. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a lethal disease. Overall survival is typically 6 months from diagnosis1. Numerous phase 3 trials of agents effective in other malignancies have failed to benefit unselected PDA populations, although patients do occasionally respond. Studies in other solid tumors have shown that heterogeneity in response is determined, in part, by molecular differences between tumors. Furthermore, treatment outcomes are improved by targeting drugs to tumor subtypes in which they are selectively effective, with breast2 and lung3 cancers providing recent examples. Identification of PDA molecular subtypes has been frustrated by a paucity of tumor specimens available for study. We have overcome this problem by combined analysis of transcriptional profiles of primary PDA samples from several studies, along with human and mouse PDA cell lines. We define three PDA subtypes: classical, quasimesenchymal and exocrine-like, and we present evidence for clinical outcome and therapeutic response differences between them. We further define gene signatures for these subtypes that may have utility in stratifying patients for treatment and present preclinical model systems that may be used to identify new subtype specific therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2146316688,"Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is a unique form of neural circuit plasticity that results in the generation of new neurons in the dentate gyrus throughout life. Neurons that arise in adults (adult-born neurons) show heightened synaptic plasticity during their maturation and can account for up to ten per cent of the entire granule cell population. Moreover, levels of adult hippocampal neurogenesis are increased by interventions that are associated with beneficial effects on cognition and mood, such as learning, environmental enrichment, exercise and chronic treatment with antidepressants. Together, these properties of adult neurogenesis indicate that this process could be harnessed to improve hippocampal functions. However, despite a substantial number of studies demonstrating that adult-born neurons are necessary for mediating specific cognitive functions, as well as some of the behavioural effects of antidepressants, it is unknown whether an increase in adult hippocampal neurogenesis is sufficient to improve cognition and mood. Here we show that inducible genetic expansion of the population of adult-born neurons through enhancing their survival improves performance in a specific cognitive task in which two similar contexts need to be distinguished. Mice with increased adult hippocampal neurogenesis show normal object recognition, spatial learning, contextual fear conditioning and extinction learning but are more efficient in differentiating between overlapping contextual representations, which is indicative of enhanced pattern separation. Furthermore, stimulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, when combined with an intervention such as voluntary exercise, produces a robust increase in exploratory behaviour. However, increasing adult hippocampal neurogenesis alone does not produce a behavioural response like that induced by anxiolytic agents or antidepressants. Together, our findings suggest that strategies that are designed to increase adult hippocampal neurogenesis specifically, by targeting the cell death of adult-born neurons or by other mechanisms, may have therapeutic potential for reversing impairments in pattern separation and dentate gyrus dysfunction such as those seen during normal ageing."

https://openalex.org/W2087004322,"Itch, the unpleasant sensation that evokes a desire to scratch, accompanies numerous skin and nervous system disorders. In many cases, pathological itch is insensitive to antihistamine treatment. Recent studies have identified members of the Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor (Mrgpr) family that are activated by mast cell mediators and promote histamine-independent itch. MrgprA3 and MrgprC11 act as receptors for the pruritogens chloroquine and BAM8-22, respectively. However, the signaling pathways and transduction channels activated downstream of these pruritogens are largely unknown. We found that TRPA1 is the downstream target of both MrgprA3 and MrgprC11 in cultured sensory neurons and heterologous cells. TRPA1 is required for Mrgpr-mediated signaling, as sensory neurons from TRPA1-deficient mice exhibited markedly diminished responses to chloroquine and BAM8-22. Similarly, TRPA1-deficient mice displayed little to no scratching in response to these pruritogens. Our findings indicate that TRPA1 is an essential component of the signaling pathways that promote histamine-independent itch."
https://openalex.org/W1963998725,"Meiotic recombination predominantly occurs at discrete genomic loci called recombination hotspots, but the features defining these areas are still largely unknown (reviewed in refs 1-5). To allow a comprehensive analysis of hotspot-associated DNA and chromatin characteristics, we developed a direct molecular approach for mapping meiotic DNA double-strand breaks that initiate recombination. Here we present the genome-wide distribution of recombination initiation sites in the mouse genome. Hotspot centres are mapped with approximately 200-nucleotide precision, which allows analysis of the fine structural details of the preferred recombination sites. We determine that hotspots share a centrally distributed consensus motif, possess a nucleotide skew that changes polarity at the centres of hotspots and have an intrinsic preference to be occupied by a nucleosome. Furthermore, we find that the vast majority of recombination initiation sites in mouse males are associated with testis-specific trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 that is distinct from histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation marks associated with transcription. The recombination map presented here has been derived from a homogeneous mouse population with a defined genetic background and therefore lends itself to extensive future experimental exploration. We note that the mapping technique developed here does not depend on the availability of genetic markers and hence can be easily adapted to other species with complex genomes. Our findings uncover several fundamental features of mammalian recombination hotspots and underline the power of the new recombination map for future studies of genetic recombination, genome stability and evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2088295232,"Heterotopic ossification is the conversion of soft tissue into bone, usually after surgery or trauma but also as a result of the genetic disease fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. Masahiro Iwamoto and his colleagues have now shown that retinoic receptor-γ agonists ameliorate this condition in mouse models. Heterotopic ossification consists of ectopic bone formation within soft tissues after surgery or trauma. It can have debilitating consequences, but there is no definitive cure. Here we show that heterotopic ossification was essentially prevented in mice receiving a nuclear retinoic acid receptor-γ (RAR-γ) agonist. Side effects were minimal, and there was no significant rebound effect. To uncover the mechanisms of these responses, we treated mouse mesenchymal stem cells with an RAR-γ agonist and transplanted them into nude mice. Whereas control cells formed ectopic bone masses, cells that had been pretreated with the RAR-γ agonist did not, suggesting that they had lost their skeletogenic potential. The cells became unresponsive to rBMP-2 treatment in vitro and showed decreases in phosphorylation of Smad1, Smad5 and Smad8 and in overall levels of Smad proteins. In addition, an RAR-γ agonist blocked heterotopic ossification in transgenic mice expressing activin receptor-like kinase-2 (ALK2) Q207D, a constitutively active form of the receptor that is related to ALK2 R206H found in individuals with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. The data indicate that RAR-γ agonists are potent inhibitors of heterotopic ossification in mouse models and, thus, may also be effective against injury-induced and congenital heterotopic ossification in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2028756092,"The mechanisms involved in the transition to an epileptic seizure remain unclear. To examine them, we used tissue slices from human subjects with mesial temporal lobe epilepsies. Ictal-like discharges were induced in the subiculum by increasing excitability along with alkalinization or low Mg(2+). During the transition, distinct pre-ictal discharges emerged concurrently with interictal events. Intracranial recordings from the mesial temporal cortex of subjects with epilepsy revealed that similar discharges before seizures were restricted to seizure onset sites. In vitro, pre-ictal events spread faster and had larger amplitudes than interictal discharges and had a distinct initiation site. These events depended on glutamatergic mechanisms and were preceded by pyramidal cell firing, whereas interneuron firing preceded interictal events that depended on both glutamatergic and depolarizing GABAergic transmission. Once established, recurrence of these pre-ictal discharges triggered seizures. Thus, the subiculum supports seizure generation, and the transition to seizure involves an emergent glutamatergic population activity."
https://openalex.org/W2057304270,"Electrical activity has been shown to regulate development in a variety of species and in various structures, including the retina, spinal cord and cortex. Within the mammalian cortex specifically, the development of dendrites and commissural axons in pyramidal cells is activity-dependent. However, little is known about the developmental role of activity in the other major cortical population of neurons, the GABA-producing interneurons. These neurons are morphologically and functionally heterogeneous and efforts over the past decade have focused on determining the mechanisms that contribute to this diversity. It was recently discovered that 30% of all cortical interneurons arise from a relatively novel source within the ventral telencephalon, the caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE). Owing to their late birth date, these interneurons populate the cortex only after the majority of other interneurons and pyramidal cells are already in place and have started to functionally integrate. Here we demonstrate in mice that for CGE-derived reelin (Re)-positive and calretinin (Cr)-positive (but not vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-positive) interneurons, activity is essential before postnatal day 3 for correct migration, and that after postnatal day 3, glutamate-mediated activity controls the development of their axons and dendrites. Furthermore, we show that the engulfment and cell motility 1 gene (Elmo1), a target of the transcription factor distal-less homeobox 1 (Dlx1), is selectively expressed in Re(+) and Cr(+) interneurons and is both necessary and sufficient for activity-dependent interneuron migration. Our findings reveal a selective requirement for activity in shaping the cortical integration of specific neuronal subtypes."

https://openalex.org/W2031197030,"Chronic wound infections and antibiotic resistance are driving interest in antimicrobial treatments that have generally been considered complementary, including antimicrobially active honey. Australia has unique native flora and produces honey with a wide range of different physicochemical properties. In this study we surveyed 477 honey samples, derived from native and exotic plants from various regions of Australia, for their antibacterial activity using an established screening protocol. A level of activity considered potentially therapeutically useful was found in 274 (57%) of the honey samples, with exceptional activity seen in samples derived from marri (Corymbia calophylla), jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) and jellybush (Leptospermum polygalifolium). In most cases the antibacterial activity was attributable to hydrogen peroxide produced by the bee-derived enzyme glucose oxidase. Non-hydrogen peroxide activity was detected in 80 (16.8%) samples, and was most consistently seen in honey produced from Leptospermum spp. Testing over time found the hydrogen peroxide-dependent activity in honey decreased, in some cases by 100%, and this activity was more stable at 4 °C than at 25 °C. In contrast, the non-hydrogen peroxide activity of Leptospermum honey samples increased, and this was greatest in samples stored at 25 °C. The stability of non-peroxide activity from other honeys was more variable, suggesting this activity may have a different cause. We conclude that many Australian honeys have clinical potential, and that further studies into the composition and stability of their active constituents are warranted."

https://openalex.org/W2058378174,"Accumulation of vitamin A-derived lipofuscin fluorophores in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a pathologic feature of recessive Stargardt macular dystrophy, a blinding disease caused by dysfunction or loss of the ABCA4 transporter in rods and cones. Age-related macular degeneration, a prevalent blinding disease of the elderly, is strongly associated with mutations in the genes for complement regulatory proteins (CRP), causing chronic inflammation of the RPE. Here we explore the possible relationship between lipofuscin accumulation and complement activation in vivo. Using the abca4−/− mouse model for recessive Stargardt, we investigated the role of lipofuscin fluorophores (A2E-lipofuscin) on oxidative stress and complement activation. We observed higher expression of oxidative-stress genes and elevated products of lipid peroxidation in eyes from abca4−/− versus wild-type mice. We also observed higher levels of complement-activation products in abca4−/− RPE cells. Unexpectedly, expression of multiple CRPs, which protect cells from attack by the complement system, were lower in abca4−/− versus wild-type RPE. To test whether acute exposure of healthy RPE cells to A2E-lipofuscin affects oxidative stress and expression of CRPs, we fed cultured fetal-derived human RPE cells with rod outer segments from wild-type or abca4−/− retinas. In contrast to RPE cells in abca4−/− mice, human RPE cells exposed to abca4−/− rod outer segments adaptively increased expression of both oxidative-stress and CRP genes. These results suggest that A2E accumulation causes oxidative stress, complement activation, and down-regulation of protective CRP in the Stargardt mouse model.

In AMD, complement system dysregulation due to CRP dysfunction results in chronic inflammation of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (13Richards A. Kavanagh D. Atkinson J.P. Adv. Immunol. 2007; 96: 141-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This cell monolayer is critical for sustained viability of the adjacent photoreceptors. A pathological hallmark of AMD is the formation of extracellular deposits called drusen within Bruch's membrane, beneath the RPE (14Young R.W. Surv. Ophthalmol. 1987; 31: 291-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Another etiologic feature of AMD is oxidative damage (15Shen J.K. Dong A. Hackett S.F. Bell W.R. Green W.R. Campochiaro P.A. Histol. Histopathol. 2007; 22: 1301-1308PubMed Google Scholar). Malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), generated from oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, are two abundant products of lipid peroxidation. HNE-derived protein modifications in retinal tissue occur as the result of light damage and age (16Tanito M. Elliott M.H. Kotake Y. Anderson R.E. Invest Ophthalmol. Vis.

Recessive Stargardt macular degeneration is a central blinding disease similar to AMD, with an age of onset during the first or second decade of life. In contrast to AMD, Stargardt exhibits simple Mendelian transmission and is caused by mutations in the ABCA4 gene (19Allikmets R. Singh N. Sun H. Shroyer N.F. Hutchinson A. Chidambaram A. Gerrard B.

Pathologically, Stargardt is characterized by deposition of autofluorescent lipofuscin pigments in RPE cells (22Delori F.C. Staurenghi G. Arend O. Dorey C.K. Goger D.G. Weiter J.J. Invest.

The ABCA4 gene encodes an ATP binding cassette transporter located in the rims of rod and cone outer segment (OS) discs (24Illing M. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10303-10310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). ABCA4 functions as a flippase for N-retinylidene-phosphatidylethanolamine, the Schiff-base condensation product of all-trans-retinaldehyde and phosphatidylethanolamine across disc membranes (25Sun H. Molday R.S. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8269-8281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Similar to Stargardt patients, mice with a knock-out mutation in the abca4 gene deposit fluorescent lipofuscin granules in the RPE (26Weng J. Mata N.L. Azarian S.M. Tzekov R.T. Birch D.G. Travis G.H. Cell. 1999; 98: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). The major fluorophore of lipofuscin is the bis-retinoid pyridinium salt A2E, which exhibits several modes of cytotoxicity in RPE cells (27Sparrow J.R. Zhou J. Ben-Shabat S. Vollmer H. Itagaki Y. Nakanishi K. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 1222-1227PubMed Google Scholar). Blue-light irradiation of A2E-containing RPE cells induces formation of A2E-oxiranes (epoxides) and other oxidation products (28Wang Z. Keller L.M. Dillon J. Gaillard E.R. Photochem.

We previously showed in the abca4−/− mouse that exposure to high intensity cyclic light results in formation of A2E oxidation products (31Radu R.A. Mata N.L. Bagla A. Travis G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 5928-5933Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Moreover, increased light exposure leads to age-dependent retinal degeneration in albino abca4−/− mice (32Radu R.A.

Accumulation of lipofuscin fluorophores in the RPE is critical to the etiology of Stargardt macular dystrophy (33Boon C.J. Jeroen Klevering B. Keunen J.E. Hoyng C.B. Theelen T. Vision Res. 2008; 48: 2569-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, lipofuscin accumulation is less commonly seen in AMD. A2E and related lipofuscin pigments have been shown to activate complement in cultured RPE cells after light exposure (34Zhou J. Kim S.R. Westlund B.S. Sparrow J.R. Invest Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2009; 50: 1392-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 35Zhou J. Jang Y.P. Kim S.R. Sparrow J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16182-16187Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In the current study we explored the possibility that dysregulation of the complement system may play a role in the etiology of Stargardt disease. Using the albino abca4−/− mouse as a model, we show that accumulation of lipofuscin fluorophores is associated with increased oxidative stress and complement activation in vivo. These observations suggest that chronic inflammation of the RPE due to local activation of complement represents a common etiologic feature of AMD and Stargardt disease. Wild-type (BALB/c) and abca4−/− albino mice were raised under a 12-h cyclic light (20–40 lux in cages) and fed a standard rodent diet (NIH-31, 7013 Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI). All mice were homozygous for the wild-type (Leu-450) allele of the rpe65 gene. Mouse studies were done in adherence to guidelines established by the UCLA Animal Research Committee and The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. Mice were dark-adapted overnight, and all tissue manipulations were performed under dim red light (Eastman Kodak Co. Wratten 1A filter). After euthanasia, eyes were removed and hemisected. The anterior portion containing the cornea, lens, and vitreous was discarded. Eyecups containing retina, RPE, choroid, and sclera were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C for further processing. For some analyses, retinas were removed, and the homogenates were prepared from eyecups containing RPE/choroid/sclera only. Single eyecups or 400-μl samples of crude rod outer segments (ROS) (see preparation below) were homogenized in 1.0 ml of PBS. Four ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) were added, and the samples were extracted with the addition of 4.0 ml of chloroform and 3.0 ml of distilled H2O followed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. The extraction was repeated with the addition of 4.0 ml of chloroform. The organic phases were pooled, dried under a stream of argon, and dissolved in 100 μl of 2-propanol. Analysis of A2E and A2E precursors was done by normal phase on a silica column (Agilent-Zorbax-Sil 5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm) in an Agilent model 1100 high performance liquid chromatograph equipped with a photodiode array detector (Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE). The mobile phase was hexane, 2-propanol, ethanol, 25 mm potassium phosphate, glacial acetic acid (485:376:100:45:0.275 v/v) and was filtered before use. The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min. Column and solvent temperatures were maintained at 40 °C. Absorption units corresponding to the A2E peak at 435 nm were converted to pmol using a calibration curve with an authentic A2E standard and the published molar extinction coefficient for A2E (36Parish C.A.

Age-matched BALB/c (WT) and albino abca4−/− (KO) mouse eyecups containing RPE (without retina, vitreous, lens, and cornea) were flash-frozen before homogenization in CompleteTM EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Protein concentrations in the homogenates were determined by a BCA protein assay reaction (Micro BCATM Protein Assay kit, Pierce from Thermo Fisher Scientific). Protein extracts from mice of different ages were tested for C3/C3b, CRRY, CFH, SOD1, CAT1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and C-reactive protein. Briefly, 20–30 μg of protein was separated using a 7% Tris acetate (C3), 4% Tris-glycine (CFH), 10% Bis-Tris (CAT1), and 12% Bis-Tris (SOD1, MCP-1, CRRY, C-reactive protein) gels in MOPS running buffer, then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C with Odyssey blocking buffer (LiCor) followed by incubation at room temperature for 1 h with goat anti-mouse C3 (Cappel, 1:500), rabbit polyclonal C-reactive protein (Abnova, 1:200), SOD1 (Assay Design, 1:200), CAT1 (Abcam, 1:200), MCP-1 (Cell Signaling, 1:100), GAPDH (Sigma, 1:10,000), sheep polyclonal CFH (Novus Biological, 1:200), mouse anti-rat CRRY (BD Biosciences, 1:500), and mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (Sigma, 1:10,000) in 0.5% normal donkey serum. Bands were detected with fluorescent-labeled donkey anti-goat 680 (LI-COR Biosciences, 1:50,000), goat anti-rabbit 680 (LI-COR Biosciences, 1:10,000), goat anti-rat 680 (LI-COR Biosciences, 1:10,000), goat anti-mouse 680 (LI-COR Biosciences, 1:10,000), and donkey anti-sheep (Rockland, 1:10,000) using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). Band intensities were then quantified and normalized to mouse anti-α-tubulin antibody for SOD1, CAT1, CFH, and C3/C3b or GAPDH antibody for CRRY, MCP-1, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Quantification was done in three independent experiments using four to six eyes for each time point for each group of mice, and the average data were presented with S.D. Statistical analyses were done using the Student's t test. Mouse eyecups were homogenized in 1.0 ml of PBS buffer. A 100-μl aliquot of the homogenate was removed for protein BCA assay (Micro BCATM protein assay kit, Pierce from Thermo Fisher Scientific). The tissue homogenates (800 μl) were mixed with 26 μl of 4.4 mm butylated hydroxytoluene and 13.6 μl of 10 m NaOH. The reaction mix was incubated under continuous shaking at 60 °C for 30 min. The samples were allowed to cool down at room temperature (RT) and reacted with 227 μl of a mixture of 38% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and 2% KI followed by mixing and incubation on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation at 7000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, 500 μl of the supernatant was removed and transferred to a new tube containing an equal volume of 0.66% 2-thiobarbituric acid. After incubation at 95 °C for 30 min, each sample was cooled to RT. The amount of MDA was determined on a Shimadzu UV160U spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments) at 534 nm (ϵMDA = 157,000 m−1cm−1) using water as reference. The data represent the means with S.D. and were reported as nmol/μg of total protein. Tissue preparation and protein quantification were done as described above. The homogenate samples were diluted to 10 μg/ml in PBS. 100-μl aliquots of each sample (10 μg/ml) or the reduced HNE-BSA standards (OxiSelectTM HNE-His Adduct ELISA kit, Cell Biolabs Inc.) were added to a 96-well protein binding plate and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. All wells were washed twice with 250 μl of PBS dried by gently tapping on a paper towel. Each well received 200 μl of the Assay Diluent, and the plate was incubated for 2 h at RT on an orbital shaker. Wells were washed 3 times with 250 μl of Wash Buffer followed by thorough aspiration. The samples were incubated with 100 μl of diluted anti-HNE-His antibody at RT for 1 h on an orbital shaker. Wells were washed 3 times with 250 μl of Wash Buffer followed by thorough aspiration. Diluted secondary antibody/HRP conjugate was added to each well followed by incubation and washing steps. After an additional two washes with the Wash Buffer, 100 μl of the Substrate Solution was added to each emptied well and incubated on an orbital shaker for 5–20 min at RT. The enzyme reaction was quenched by the addition of 100 μl of Stop Solution. Absorbance of each well was detected in a SPECTRA max 340PC microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corp.) using 450 nm as the primary wavelength and the reduced HNE-BSA standard as reference. The average data were presented as μg per ml with S.D. For both thiobarbituric acid reactive substance and ELISA assays, three independent experiments with three eyes were analyzed for each time (n = 9). Mice were euthanized under anesthesia and fixed by intracardiac perfusion with 2% formaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. The nasal and temporal hemispheres of each eyecup were fixed additionally in 1% osmium tetroxide dissolved with 0.1 m sodium phosphate then dehydrated in a graded series of alcohols. The temporal hemispheres were embedded in an Epon/Araldite mixture (5 parts/3 parts) for light microscopy (data not shown). The nasal hemispheres were cut into quadrants and embedded in Araldite 502 (Ted Pella, Redding, CA) for electron microscopy. Ultrathin sections for electron microscopy were cut on a Leica Ultracut ultramicrotome. The sections were collected on 200-mesh copper grids and stained with uranium and lead salts before viewing on a Zeiss 910 electron microscope. Electron microscopic images were acquired from the inferior-nasal quadrant sections. Three images of RPE cells from each experimental group were photographed at the same magnification using a Keenview TM digital camera. From each image, three measurements of Bruch's membrane and RPE basal infoldings were taken. Each measurement was considered as n = 1 so a total of n = 9 were collected. AnalySIS software was used to measure Bruch's membrane thickness and basal infoldings. The results were presented as the means with S.D. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. Mice were euthanized under anesthesia and fixed by intracardiac perfusion with 4% formaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. The eyes were dissected into quadrants. The quadrants were dehydrated in a graded series of alcohols, infiltrated, and embedded in LR White Resin medium grade (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Ultrathin sections (100 nm) were cut on a Leica Ultracut microtome and collected on 200-mesh Formvar carbon-coated nickel grids. The sections were processed for EM immunocytochemistry using anti C3/C3b (Cell Science) as the primary antibody (1:50) and 12-nm colloidal gold affinity-purified goat anti-rat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) as a secondary antibody (1:20). The sections are stained with uranium salts and viewed at 6300× magnification on a Zeiss 910 transmission electron microscope. AnalySIS software was used to count the number of gold particles per area. The mean of the gold particles was calculated from 10 images of each group. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's test. Mice were euthanized under anesthesia, the eyes were removed, anterior segments were dissected away, and the eyecups were fixed overnight at 4 °C in 0.1% PBS and 4% paraformaldehyde. Eyecups were infiltrated with 10% sucrose in PBS for 1 h and 20% sucrose in PBS for 2 h, then embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (Sakura). 10-μm cryostat sections were cut and mounted on Superfrost Plus slides. The sections were warmed to room temperature and fixed briefly with 4% formaldehyde for 5 min and then washed with PBS 3 times. The sections were blocked with goat serum or donkey serum (0.5%, Sigma) and 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h followed by incubation with primary antibodies, rat anti-C3a (1:50), rat anti-iC3b (1:50, Cell Science), or goat anti-C-reactive protein (1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The sections were rinsed three times and then incubated in goat anti-rat or donkey anti-goat IgG secondary antibodies conjugated with rhodamine red (1:200, Invitrogen) for 1 h followed by rinsing. The sections were mounted with 5% n-propylgallate in 100% glycerol mounting medium. The images of the mouse retina sections were captured with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope under a 63× oil objective using an excitation wavelength of 488 and 543 nm with emission wavelengths of 505–530 and 560–615 nm, respectively. The immunostaining of CRRY was performed with the Vector M.O.M immunodetection kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). A mouse monoclonal anti-CRRY (1:50, BD Bioscience) and the prolong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Molecular Probes) were used, and the images were captured with an Olympus FluoView FV1000 confocal laser-scanning microscope under 60× oil objective with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and emission wavelength of 560–615 nm. The average fluorescein pixel intensity of each section was counted. 17 sections from the Balb/C and 16 sections of the abca4−/− mice retina were compared. The results were presented as the means with S.D. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. BALB/c and abca4−/− retinas of 3–6-month-old mice were collected in 45% sucrose in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen). Crude ROS were obtained by gentle vortexing followed by sedimentation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was diluted 1:4 (vol:vol) with Hanks' balanced salt solution. Crude ROS were pelleted down after spinning for 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The ROS pellet was washed two times with Hanks' balanced salt solution and re-suspended in DMEM (Sigma) for fetal human RPE incubation. Human RPE cells on Y402 variant for CFH gene were collected from the eyes of aborted fetuses of 18 weeks gestation. The dissociated RPE cells were resuspended in Eagle's minimum essential medium without calcium (Joklik, Sigma) with the addition of 54 μm CaCl2, amino acid supplements, and other additives as described previously (37Hu J. Bok D. Mol. Vis. 2001; 7: 14-19PubMed Google Scholar). The RPE culture reached confluence and released RPE daughter cells in the medium in ∼10 days. Non-attached cells were collected and seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells onto Millicell-HA culture wells (Millipore) coated with mouse laminin (Collaborative Research). The RPE cells were then grown and maintained in Chee's essential replacement medium (40Li B. Sallee C. Dehoff M. Foley S. Molina H. Holers V.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4295-4305PubMed Google Scholar) containing 1% calf serum and 1.8 mm CaCl2 (minimum essential medium, Irvine Scientific) for two months before use. 400 μl of freshly prepared mouse ROS (from four mouse retinas) in DMEM were added to the apical compartment. The basal compartment received 400 μl of DMEM, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The filters containing the RPE cells were washed twice in 1× PBS and harvested for RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis for quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Total RNA was extracted from the eyecups containing RPE of BALB/c (WT) and albino abca4−/− (KO) mice or fetal human RPE cells using Absolutely RNA Miniprep kit (Stratagene) with DNase treatment and was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using SuperScript III (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was done on a DNA Engine Opticon2 (MJ Research-Bio-Rad) using a two-step kit with SYBR Green (Invitrogen) and mouse gene-specific primer sets for complement regulator protein and oxidative stress genes DAF1 (NM_010016.2, AATGCGAGGGGAAAGTGAC (forward) and TGAGGGGGTTCCTGTACTTG (reverse)), DAF2 (NM_007827.2, GTCATCACCACCACTGCTGCTG (forward) and ATTAGGAATGTCTGGAGGTGGGC (reverse)), CRRY (NM_013499.2, CCAGCAGTGTGCATTGTCAGTCC (forward) and CCCCTTCTGGAATCCACTCATCTC (reverse)), CD59a (NM_001111060.1, GAGCATGAGCACAGTCACTGGCG (forward) and GAACACAGCCAGAAGCAGCAGGAG (reverse)), CD59b (NM_181858.1, GAGCCAAACAACGCAGAAACTTCC (forward) and GGGCATCCAGGATGACTTAGAAGC (reverse)), CFH (NM_009888.3, ACCACATGTGCCAAATGCTA (forward) and TGTTGAGTCTCGGCACTTTG (reverse)) (38Yang P.

https://openalex.org/W2138697369,"Cannabis-induced analgesia results from potentiation of the α1 and α3 glycine receptors via a specific interaction with a transmembrane segment of the receptors, and this distinguishes the analgesic effects from the psychoactive effects of cannabinoids. Cannabinoids enhance the function of glycine receptors (GlyRs). However, little is known about the mechanisms and behavioral implication of cannabinoid-GlyR interaction. Using mutagenesis and NMR analysis, we have identified a serine at 296 in the GlyR protein critical for the potentiation of IGly by Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a major psychoactive component of marijuana. The polarity of the amino acid residue at 296 and the hydroxyl groups of THC are critical for THC potentiation. Removal of the hydroxyl groups of THC results in a compound that does not affect IGly when applied alone but selectively antagonizes cannabinoid-induced potentiating effect on IGly and analgesic effect in a tail-flick test in mice. The cannabinoid-induced analgesia is absent in mice lacking α3GlyRs but not in those lacking CB1 and CB2 receptors. These findings reveal a new mechanism underlying cannabinoid potentiation of GlyRs, which could contribute to some of the cannabis-induced analgesic and therapeutic effects."
https://openalex.org/W2020189206,"Targeting pro-inflammatory events to reduce seizures is gaining momentum. Experimentally, antagonism of inflammatory processes and of blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage has been demonstrated to be beneficial in reducing status epilepticus (SE). Clinically, a role of inflammation in the pathophysiology of drug resistant epilepsies is suspected. However, the use anti-inflammatory drug such as glucocorticosteroids (GCs) is limited to selected pediatric epileptic syndromes and spasms. Lack of animal data may be one of the reasons for the limited use of GCs in epilepsy. We evaluated the effect of the CG dexamethasone in reducing the onset and the severity of pilocarpine SE in rats. We assessed BBB integrity by measuring serum S100β and Evans Blue brain extravasation. Electrophysiological monitoring and hematologic measurements (WBCs and IL-1β) were performed. We reviewed the effect of add on dexamethasone treatment on a population of pediatric patients affected by drug resistant epilepsy. We excluded subjects affected by West, Landau-Kleffner or Lennox-Gastaut syndromes and Rasmussen encephalitis, known to respond to GCs or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The effect of two additional GCs, methylprednisolone and hydrocortisone, was also reviewed in this population. When dexamethasone treatment preceded exposure to the convulsive agent pilocarpine, the number of rats developing status epilepticus (SE) was reduced. When SE developed, the time-to-onset was significantly delayed compared to pilocarpine alone and mortality associated with pilocarpine-SE was abolished. Dexamethasone significantly protected the BBB from damage. The clinical study included pediatric drug resistant epileptic subjects receiving add on GC treatments. Decreased seizure frequency (≥50%) or interruption of status epilepticus was observed in the majority of the subjects, regardless of the underlying pathology. Our experimental results point to a seizure-reducing effect of dexamethasone. The mechanism encompasses improvement of BBB integrity. Our results also suggest that add on GCs could be of efficacy in controlling pediatric drug resistant seizures."
https://openalex.org/W2084016524,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary malignancy of bone. There is a critical need to identify the events that lead to the poorly understood mechanism of OS development and metastasis. The goal of this investigation is to identify and characterize a novel marker of OS progression. We have established and characterized a highly metastatic OS subline that is derived from the less metastatic human MG63 line through serial passages in nude mice via intratibial injections. Microarray analysis of the parental MG63, the highly metastatic MG63.2 subline, as well as the corresponding primary tumors and pulmonary metastases revealed insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP5) to be one of the significantly downregulated genes in the metastatic subline. Confirmatory quantitative RT-PCR on 20 genes of interest demonstrated IGFBP5 to be the most differentially expressed and was therefore chosen to be one of the genes for further investigation. Adenoviral mediated overexpression and knockdown of IGFBP5 in the MG63 and MG63.2 cell lines, as well as other OS lines (143B and MNNG/HOS) that are independent of our MG63 lines, were employed to examine the role of IGFBP5. We found that overexpression of IGFBP5 inhibited in vitro cell proliferation, migration and invasion of OS cells. Additionally, IGFBP5 overexpression promoted apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. In an orthotopic xenograft animal model, overexpression of IGFBP5 inhibited OS tumor growth and pulmonary metastases. Conversely, siRNA-mediated knockdown of IGFBP5 promoted OS tumor growth and pulmonary metastases in vivo. Immunohistochemical staining of patient-matched primary and metastatic OS samples demonstrated decreased IGFBP5 expression in the metastases. These results suggest 1) a role for IGFBP5 as a novel marker that has an important role in the pathogenesis of OS, and 2) that the loss of IGFBP5 function may contribute to more metastatic phenotypes in OS."
https://openalex.org/W1981976414,"We describe here the synthesis and activity of a new series of oxime reactivators of cholinesterases (ChEs) that contain tertiary amine or imidazole protonatable functional groups. Equilibration between the neutral and protonated species at physiological pH enables the reactivators to cross the blood-brain barrier and distribute in the CNS aqueous space as dictated by interstitial and cellular pH values. Our structure-activity analysis of 134 novel compounds considers primarily imidazole aldoximes and N-substituted 2-hydroxyiminoacetamides. Reactivation capacities of novel oximes are rank ordered by their relative reactivation rate constants at 0.67 mm compared with 2-pyridinealdoxime methiodide for reactivation of four organophosphate (sarin, cyclosarin, VX, and paraoxon) conjugates of human acetylcholinesterase (hAChE). Rank order of the rates differs for reactivation of human butyrylcholinesterase (hBChE) conjugates. The 10 best reactivating oximes, predominantly hydroxyimino acetamide derivatives (for hAChE) and imidazole-containing aldoximes (for hBChE) also exhibited reasonable activity in the reactivation of tabun conjugates. Reactivation kinetics of the lead hydroxyimino acetamide reactivator of hAChE, when analyzed in terms of apparent affinity (1/Kox) and maximum reactivation rate (k2), is superior to the reference uncharged reactivators monoisonitrosoacetone and 2,3-butanedione monoxime and shows potential for further refinement. The disparate pH dependences for reactivation of ChE and the general base-catalyzed oximolysis of acetylthiocholine reveal that distinct reactivator ionization states are involved in the reactivation of ChE conjugates and in conferring nucleophilic reactivity of the oxime group.

https://openalex.org/W2023640259,"Perceptual learning has been proposed to result from improvements either in early sensory processing or at the later stage of sensory decoding. Here the authors show that altering the feedforward connectivity in a recurrent neural network so as to improve probabilistic inference in early visual areas results in both modest changes in tuning curves and reduced noise correlations. Extensive training on simple tasks such as fine orientation discrimination results in large improvements in performance, a form of learning known as perceptual learning. Previous models have argued that perceptual learning is due to either sharpening and amplification of tuning curves in early visual areas or to improved probabilistic inference in later visual areas (at the decision stage). However, early theories are inconsistent with the conclusions of psychophysical experiments manipulating external noise, whereas late theories cannot explain the changes in neural responses that have been reported in cortical areas V1 and V4. Here we show that we can capture both the neurophysiological and behavioral aspects of perceptual learning by altering only the feedforward connectivity in a recurrent network of spiking neurons so as to improve probabilistic inference in early visual areas. The resulting network shows modest changes in tuning curves, in line with neurophysiological reports, along with a marked reduction in the amplitude of pairwise noise correlations."
https://openalex.org/W2045910171,"The BH3 mimetic ABT737 induces autophagy by competitively disrupting the inhibitory interaction between the BH3 domain of Beclin 1 and the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L), thereby stimulating the Beclin 1-dependent allosteric activation of the pro-autophagic lipid kinase VPS34. Here, we examined whether ABT737 stimulates other pro-autophagic signal-transduction pathways. ABT737 caused the activating phosphorylation of AMP-dependent kinase (AMPK) and of the AMPK substrate acetyl CoA carboxylase, the activating phosphorylation of several subunits of the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB) kinase (IKK) and the hyperphosphorylation of the IKK substrate IκB, inhibition of the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and consequent dephosphorylation of the mTOR substrate S6 kinase. In addition, ABT737 treatment dephosphorylates (and hence likewise inhibits) p53, glycogen synthase kinase-3 and Akt. All these effects were shared by ABT737 and another structurally unrelated BH3 mimetic, HA14-1. Functional experiments revealed that pharmacological or genetic inhibition of IKK, Sirtuin and the p53-depleting ubiquitin ligase MDM2 prevented ABT737-induced autophagy. These results point to unexpected and pleiotropic pro-autophagic effects of BH3 mimetics involving the modulation of multiple signalling pathways."

Goetzl E.J. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 551-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). S1P/S1P1 is essential for effective T lymphocyte egress and, therefore, the FTY720 phosphate-induced down-regulation of S1P1 on T lymphocytes results in their retention in the lymph (6Mandala S. Hajdu R. Bergstrom J. Quackenbush E. Xie J. Milligan J. Thornton R. Shei G.J. Card D. Koehane C. Rosenbach M. Hale J. Lynch C.L. Rupprecht K. Parsons W. Rosen H. Science. 2002; 296: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar). An alternative therapeutic approach is to use a S1P-neutralizing antibody that reduces bioavailability of S1P at its receptors. This has proven very successful as an antitumorigenic and antiangiogenic agent in a number of disease models (7Visentin B. Vekich J.A. Sibbald B.J. Cavalli A.L. Moreno K.M. Matteo R.G. Garland W.A.

Thus, current target intervention is confined to inhibiting S1P binding to receptors or limiting bioavailability of S1P at these receptors. Recently, novel intracellular targets of S1P have been identified. Prominent examples are histone deacetylase (8Hait N.C. Allegood J. Maceyka M. Strub G.M. Harikumar K.B. Singh S.K. Luo C.

These findings underscore the importance of limiting the intracellular action of S1P. Indeed, there is evidence for a role for SK1 in human cancers, such as increased levels of SK1 mRNA transcript and/or SK1 protein in cancers of the stomach, lung, brain, colon, kidney, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, and breast (see review, see Ref. 1Pyne N.J. Pyne S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10: 489-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). For example, high expression of SK1 and cognate S1P1 and S1P3 receptors is correlated with poor survival rates and induction of Tamoxifen resistance in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients, where the average survival time is reduced from 18 years to 7.5 years and recurrence of the disease in patients receiving Tamoxifen is shortened by 8 years in the high SK1 expression group (10Long J.S.

In addition, SK1 induces chemotherapeutic resistance in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells (a model for castrate-independent prostate cancer), indicating that this enzyme might have a role in the generic development of chemotherapeutic resistance in cancer (12Loveridge C. Tonelli F. Leclecq T. Lim K.G. Long. S. Berdyshev E. Tate R.J. Natarajan V. Pitson Pyne N.J. Pyne S. J. Biol.

Moreover, siRNA knockdown of SK1 significantly inhibited aberrant crypt formation and cancer development in a mouse model of colon cancer, suggesting a key role for SK1 in both early and late stages of carcinogenesis (13Kawamori T. Osta W. Johnson K.R. Pettus B.J. Bielawski J. Tanaka T. Wargovich M.J. Reddy B.S. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Zhou D. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported that FTY720 inhibits purified SK1 activity and induces the proteasomal degradation of SK1 in mammalian cells (14Tonelli F. Lim K.G. Loveridge C. Long J. Pitson S.M. Tigyi G. Bittman R. Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Cell. Signal. 2010; 22: 1536-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We also established that the (R) and (S) enantiomers of FTY720 vinylphosphonate (S > R) are inhibitors of purified SK1 and demonstrated that (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate induced its proteasomal degradation in cells, whereas their saturated counterpart, (R)- or (S)-FTY720 phosphonate, and (S)-FTY720 phosphate do not significantly inhibit the enzyme (14Tonelli F.

To elucidate the mechanisms by which specific FTY720 analogues function as SK1 inhibitors, we have now studied their behavior with respect to enzyme inhibition kinetics, proteasomal degradation of SK1, and rearrangement of actin in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. These studies revealed that (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate appears to inhibit SK1 via a putative allosteric site interaction. FTY720 and (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate induced the proteasomal degradation of SK1 and abrogated the S1P-stimulated rearrangement of actin into lamellipodia/membrane ruffles required for cell migration. These findings indicate that FTY720 analogues are SK1 inhibitors that exhibit novel properties that are favorable for anticancer activity.

MCF-7 Neo and HER218 breast cancer cells were grown in a monolayer culture in high glucose DMEM with 10% European FCS and 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.4% Geneticin (absent for parental cells), and 15 μg/ml insulin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. HEK 293 cells were cultured in MEM supplemented with 10% European FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1% nonessential amino acids at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and in the presence of DMEM (instead of MEM) and 0.8% Geneticin for HEK 293 cells stably overexpressing GFP-tagged SK1. HEK 293 cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000TM reagent and myc- or FLAG-tagged SK1 or G113A SK1 plasmid constructs and grown for 48 h. Cells were harvested in sample buffer (125 mm Tris, pH 6.7, 0.5 mm Na4P2O7, 1.25 mm EDTA, 0.5% w/v SDS containing 1.25% v/v glycerol, 0.06% w/v bromphenol blue, and 50 mm dithiothreitol) and were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described previously (15Alderton F.

Resolved proteins were Western blotted with anti-myc, anti-FLAG, anti-SK1, anti-ERK2, or anti-actin antibodies. Forty-eight hours after transfection with the indicated plasmid constructs, the medium was removed, and HEK 293 cells were lysed in ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer (500 μl) containing 20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.5 mm Na4P2O7, 0.2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), leupeptin, and aprotinin (all protease inhibitors were at 10 μg/ml, pH 8.0) for 20 min at 4 °C. The material was harvested and transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, which were further mixed for 60 min at 4 °C, and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris. After preclearing with protein G-Sepharose beads, equal amounts of supernatant from each sample were taken for immunoprecipitation with protein G-Sepharose beads and anti-myc or anti-FLAG antibodies. After 2 h or overnight agitation at 4 °C, the supernatant was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 s at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with 1 ml of buffer A containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and once in 1 ml of buffer A without Nonidet P-40. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 s at 4 °C and combined with boiling sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. SK1 activity was assayed as described previously (16Delon C. Manifava M. Wood E. Thompson D. Krugmann S. Pyne S. Ktistakis N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44763-44774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Briefly, sphingosine was solubilized in Triton X-100 (final concentration 0.063% w/v) and combined with buffer 1 containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 0.007% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mm PMSF, and 0.5 mm 4-deoxypyridoxine. Modulation of SK1 activity was determined by incubating 15 ng of purified SK1 or 15 μg of HEK 293 cell lysates containing stably overexpressed or transiently expressed recombinant SK1 for 15–20 min at 30 °C, in the presence of 0.5–20 μm sphingosine, 250 μm [γ-32P]ATP (4.4 × 104 cpm/nmol, in 10 mm MgCl2), and varying concentrations of inhibitors dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide or control (5% dimethyl sulfoxide). Reactions were terminated by the addition of 500 μ1 of n-butyl alcohol and mixed with 1 ml of 2 m KCl. The organic phase containing [32P]S1P was then extracted by washing twice with 1 ml of 2 m KCl before quantification by Cerenkov counting. The kinetic parameters were calculated using the graph plotting and curve fitting programs Biograph (University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK) and Prism 4.03 (GraphPad). Substrate kinetics were analyzed according to the Michaelis-Menten equation, and the inhibition constants (Kicand Kiu) were determined using Dixon and Cornish-Bowden plots (17Cortés A. Cascante M. Cárdenas M.L. Cornish-Bowden A. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Cells were plated onto autoclaved 13-mm glass coverslips and grown to 60% confluence before serum starvation for 48 h prior to stimulation. Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 min before incubation in blocking solution (5% European FCS and 1% BSA in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were then incubated with phalloidin red (1:100 dilution in blocking solution) for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were washed with PBS and mounted on glass slides using Vectashield® hard set mounting medium with DAPI. Actin rearrangement was assessed using phalloidin red staining. Fluorescence was visualized using a Nikon (Surrey, UK) E600 epifluorescence microscope. Densitometric quantification of Western blots was performed using ScanImage program (Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD). Statistical analysis was performed using an unpaired Student's t test. The structural formulas of the FTY720 analogues are shown in Fig. 1, and the synthetic schemes employed to prepare (S)-FTY720 regioisomer and Bodipy-sphingosine (Bdp-So) are outlined in supplemental Fig. 1 and supplemental Experimental Procedures. We have previously demonstrated that SKi (which was identified by French et al.) (18French K.J. Schrecengost R.S. Lee B.D. Zhuang Y. Smith S.N. Eberly J.L. Yun J.K. Smith C.D. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5962-5969PubMed Google Scholar), FTY720, and (S)-and (R)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate inhibited purified SK1 activity, whereas (S)- and (R)-FTY720 phosphonate are inactive (12Loveridge C. Tonelli F. Leclecq T. Lim K.G. Long. S. Berdyshev E. Tate R.J. Natarajan V. Pitson Pyne N.J. Pyne S. J. Biol.

Signal. 2010; 22: 1536-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Using HEK 293 cells stably overexpressing SK1 (30-fold increase in SK1 activity versus stable vector-transfected cells), we have now investigated the kinetic mechanism by which SKi, FTY720, and (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate inhibit SK1 activity (Table 1). We found that FTY720 is a competitive inhibitor (with sphingosine) with a Kic = 2 ± 0.5 μm (Table 1, Fig. 2A, and supplemental Fig. 2A). (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate is an uncompetitive inhibitor (with sphingosine) with a Kiu = 14.5 ± 4.4 μm (Table 1, Fig. 2B, and supplemental Fig. 2B). This kinetic behavior indicates that (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate binds to a putative allosteric site in SK1 contingent on formation of the SK1-sphingosine complex. Indeed, when (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate concentration was plotted against inhibition of catalysis at a fixed concentration of sphingosine (10 μm), then a Hill coefficient of 1.9 ± 0.2 and an IC50 = 20 ± 1.1 μm were obtained (Fig. 2C). A Hill coefficient of 2.2 ± 0.3 was obtained at 20 μm sphingosine (data not shown). The percent inhibition of stably overexpressed SK1 in HEK 293 cells by 50 μm (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate (using 10 μm sphingosine) showed good agreement with our previous findings using purified SK1 (14Tonelli F. Lim K.G. Loveridge C. Long J. Pitson S.M. Tigyi G. Bittman R. Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Cell. Signal. 2010; 22: 1536-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and in each case, inhibition of SK1 activity was ∼80%. Additional evidence that SK1 contains an allosteric site(s) was demonstrated by data showing that micromolar concentrations of Bdp-So (a conjugate of sphingosine with the Bodipy fluorophore) and (S)-FTY720 regioisomer, both of which are also relatively weak substrates of SK1, activated purified SK1 activity (Fig. 2D). Bdp-So stimulated SK1 activity in a concentration-dependent manner at a fixed concentration of sphingosine (10 μm) (Fig. 2D). Indeed, SK1 phosphorylated sphingosine in the presence of Bdp-So with a Hill coefficient of 4.5 ± 2.7 (Fig. 2D). SKi is a mixed inhibitor of SK1 with a Kic = 17 ± 3.5 μm and a Kiu = 48.3 ± 11.5 μm and thus was biased toward competitive inhibition at low micromolar concentrations of SKi (Table 1, Fig. 2E, and supplemental Fig. 2C).TABLE 1Kinetic constantsInhibitorInhibition mechanismInhibition constant(s)μmFTY720CompetitiveKic = 2.0 ± 0.5(S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonateUncompetitiveKiu = 14.5 ± 4.4SKiMixedKic = 17.0 ± 3.5; Kiu = 48.3 ± 11.5 Open table in a new tab The data presented in Fig. 3 demonstrate that SK1 is an oligomeric protein. This conclusion is based on results from experiments in which wild-type myc- and FLAG-tagged SK1 are transiently co-expressed in HEK 293 cells and where myc- and FLAG-tagged SK1 (molecular mass = 42 kDa) were co-immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 3A). Identical results were obtained using anti-myc antibody (Fig. 3B). The ability of SK1 to form oligomers confirms data previously published by Kihara et al. (19Kihara A. Anada Y. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4532-4539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To test whether (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate conforms to a model in which inhibitors can stabilize an allosteric site/domain that exerts an autoinhibitory effect on SK1 activity, we created hybrid SK1 oligomers containing wild-type SK1 and kinase-deficient SK1 mutant monomers. The assumption here is that each monomer of the wild enzyme contains one catalytic site and one allosteric site. Thus, co-expression of WT SK1 with D178N SK1 mutant (mutated in the sphingosine binding site) (20Yokota S. Taniguchi Y. Kihara A. Mitsutake S. Igarashi Y. FEBS Lett. 2004; 578: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) or G81D SK1 mutant (mutated in the ATP binding site) (21Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A. Zebol J.R. Xia P. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. D'Andrea R.J. Wattenberg B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33945-33950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) will result in formation of hybrid SK1 oligomers containing more allosteric sites compared with catalytic sites. Therefore, if the allosteric site exerts an autoinhibition, then we expect the catalytically deficient SK1 mutants to reduce catalytic activity of WT SK1 in the oligomer. First, we demonstrated that transiently overexpressed FLAG-tagged D178N SK1 mutant and the myc-tagged G81D SK1 mutants can indeed form oligomers with myc-tagged and FLAG-tagged WT SK1, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B). We also confirmed that the FLAG-tagged D178N SK1 mutant exhibited <10% of the activity of the wild-type enzyme (see Fig. 3C). To address directly whether mutant SK1 inhibits the catalytic activity of WT SK1, we transiently co-expressed WT myc-tagged SK1, whose concentration was fixed, with varying amounts of FLAG-tagged D178N SK1 mutant. Under these conditions, the FLAG-tagged D178N SK1 mutant inhibited WT myc-tagged SK1 activity by ∼50% (Fig. 3C). We also evaluated the nature of the inhibition kinetics with (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate or FTY720 in HEK 293 cell lysates containing transiently overexpressed WT FLAG/myc-tagged SK1. In common with stably overexpressed WT SK1, (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate was an uncompetitive inhibitor (with sphingosine) with a Kiu = 7 μm, whereas FTY720 was a competitive inhibitor with a Kic = 7 μm (data not shown). Finally, we explored the possibility that Gly113 in SK1 might be part of the putative allosteric site as mutation to alanine in SK1 results in constitutive activation of the lipid kinase (22Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A. Zebol J.R. Vadas M.A. D'Andrea R.J. Wattenberg B.W. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This is a result of an increase in Vmax, without alteration in substrate binding to the enzyme. Therefore, we tested the sensitivity of the G113A mutant SK1 (transiently overexpressed in HEK 293 cells) to (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate and Bdp-So. In this regard, (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate inhibited and Bdp-So activated the G113A SK1 mutant to an extent similar to that with WT SK1 (Fig. 3D). Previously, we demonstrated an entirely novel mechanism of functional interaction of SK1 inhibitors with SK1 that offers additional opportunities for drug discovery (12Loveridge C. Tonelli F. Leclecq T. Lim K.G. Long. S. Berdyshev E. Tate R.J. Natarajan V. Pitson Pyne N.J. Pyne S. J. Biol.

Leclecq T. Lim K.G. Long. S. Berdyshev E. Tate R.J. Natarajan V. Pitson Pyne N.J. Pyne S. J. Biol.

We showed that a number of SK1 inhibitors, including (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate, induce MG132-sensitive degradation of SK1 (treatment of cells for 6–48 h), thereby removing SK1 from MCF-7 breast cancer and LNCaP prostate cancer cells (12Loveridge C.

Indeed SK1 is polyubiquitinated, and SKi enhanced the rate at which polyubiquitinated SK1 is degraded by the proteasome (12Loveridge C. Tonelli F. Leclecq T. Lim K.G. Long. S. Berdyshev E. Tate R.J.

Moreover, SKi induces a ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of SK1 via a ceramide-dependent mechanism in LNCaP cells, a consequence of an initial inhibition of SK1 catalytic activity and perturbation of the ceramide-sphingosine-S1P rheostat (12Loveridge C. Tonelli F. Leclecq T. Lim K.G. Long. S. Berdyshev E. Tate R.J. Natarajan V. Pitson Pyne N.J. Pyne S. J. Biol.

The creation of an SK1-null cancer cell or one with severely reduced SK1 expression results in the onset of apoptosis, as indicated by increased poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage (12Loveridge C. Tonelli F. Leclecq T. Lim K.G. Long. S. Berdyshev E. Tate R.J. Natarajan V. Pitson Pyne N.J. Pyne S. J. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 4, treatment of MCF-7 Neo cells with SKi, FTY720 or (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate for 24 h induced the degradation of SK1 (molecular mass = 42 kDa). We previously observed a HER2-dependent increase in SK1 expression in the MCF-7 HER2 cells (HER218 cells, stably expressing HER2) (10Long J.S. Edwards J. Watson C. Tovey S. Mair K. Schiff R.

Indeed, all three compounds induced the MG132-sensitive proteasomal degradation of SK1 to an extent similar to that with MCF-7 Neo cells (Fig. 4). We have previously shown that siRNA knockdown of SK1 reduced the S1P-induced formation of a migratory phenotype in MCF-7 Neo cells, as assessed by inhibition of S1P-stimulated actin accumulation into membrane ruffles/lamellipodia and inhibited migration of cells in scratch assays; this is mediated by S1P3 (10Long J.S.

Actin is clustered into focal adhesions in MCF-7 Neo cells. Treatment of these cells with S1P stimulates the rearrangement of actin from focal adhesions into membrane ruffles/lamellipodia (10Long J.S. Edwards J. Watson C. Tovey S. Mair K. Schiff R. Natarajan V. Pyne N.J. Pyne S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 3827-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). Treatment of MCF-7 Neo cells with SKi, (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate (Fig. 5A), or FTY720 (Fig. 5B) for 15 min reduced the S1P-stimulated rearrangement of actin into lamellipodia/membrane ruffles and reestablished actin focal adhesions, thereby demonstrating activity that is consistent with these compounds functioning as SK1 inhibitors. We demonstrate here for the first time that (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate binds to a putative allosteric site(s) in SK1 contingent on formation of a SK1-sphingosine complex. This conclusion is based on the finding that (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate inhibited SK1 activity in an uncompetitive manner with a Kiu = 14.5 ± 4.4 μm. We also demonstrate that SK1 is an oligomer, consistent with a model that is conducive to allosterism. Moreover, SK1 appears to contain an allosteric site(s) that exerts an autoinhibitory effect on the catalytic sites. This conclusion is based on the finding that FLAG-tagged D178N SK1 mutant inhibited the catalytic activity of the WT myc-tagged SK1 in an oliogmeric arrangement. There are three alternative explanations for these findings, all of which can be excluded. First, we tested whether minimal dimerization is required to form two competent catalytic sites in a dimer by domain swapping. If this were the case, then mutagenesis of Asp178 might disable one of the catalytic sites formed between WT SK1 and D178N mutant SK1. The ATP binding site in monomer 1 might form a competent active site with the sphingosine binding site in monomer 2. Equally, the ATP binding site in monomer 2 might form a competent active site with the sphingosine binding site in monomer 1. Therefore, the formation of two competent active sites in a dimeric arrangement predicts that co-expression of the two catalytically deficient mutants to equal levels should reconstitute 50% of the wild-type activity. However, we found that co-expression of each mutant did not result in a catalytically competent oligomer (activity of the oligomer (∼10% of WT SK1) was equivalent with that of the D178N mutant SK1). Therefore, oligomerization is not required for formation of two competent catalytic sites by domain swapping. Second, it is possible that formation of oligomers is required for co-operation between catalytic sites. Thus, formation of WT SK1-D178N SK1 oligomers might disrupt this cooperation and reduce SK1 activity. However, SK1 exhibits simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and thus, the catalytic sites function independently of each other in the oligomeric arrangement. Third, oligomerization might enable functionalization of the catalytic sites, and mutagenesis of Asp178 might impair oligomerization. However, the D178N mutant SK1 is still able to form oligomers with WT SK1. Because the concentration of competent WT catalytic sites is maintained constant in the experiment, we can, therefore, attribute inhibition of WT SK1 catalytic activity by the D178N mutant to putative allosteric site(s) that exhibit autoinhibitory activity. The allosteric site(s) might exist in an “on” and “off” state in equilibrium (Fig. 6). Therefore, binding of (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate to SK1 conforms to a model in which (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate might stabilize the on state (which autoinhibits SK1 activity) of the allosteric site (which is predicted to have a longer lifetime than the unbound allosteric site), thereby increasing the lifetime of the autoinhibitory effect of the site on SK1 activity. It follows that the activators of SK1, e.g. Bdp-So and (S)-FTY720 regioisomer, might stabilize the off state, thereby relieving inhibition of SK1 activity by the allosteric site and resulting in activation of the enzyme (Fig. 6). We also demonstrated a Hill coefficient of 1.9–2.2 for the inhibition of SK1 catalytic activity by (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate. Thus, stabilization of the on allosteric site conformation by (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate will induce equilibrium transition such that the concentration of the on site conformation will increase by mass action. A Hill coefficient of ∼2 suggests that a dimer is likely to contain at least two allosteric sites that function in a cooperative manner. For Bdp-So, we obtained a Hill coefficient of 4.5, suggesting that binding of Bdp-So to the allosteric sites is also cooperative. The mutation of Gly113 to alanine in SK1 results in constitutive activation of the lipid kinase (22Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A. Zebol J.R. Vadas M.A. D'Andrea R.J. Wattenberg B.W. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), suggesting that Gly113 might be part of the allosteric site and that the mutation disables its function. Indeed, one can predict that mutation might trap the allosteric site in the off state, thereby converting SK1 into a form that is resistant to inhibition by (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate and activation by Bdp-So. However, the G113A mutant was still sensitive to inhibition by (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate and activation by Bdp-So. Therefore, Gly113 is unlikely to be involved in allosterism. We also report that the inhibition of SK1 by SKi conforms to a mixed inhibition model with a Kic = 17 ± 3.5 μm and a Kiu = 48.3 ± 11.5 μm. Therefore, SKi appears to bind to both the catalytic site and the putative allosteric site. The latter is consistent with the observation made by others that inhibition of SK1 activity by SKi is not competitive with the second substrate, ATP (18French K.J. Schrecengost R.S. Lee B.D. Zhuang Y. Smith S.N. Eberly J.L. Yun J.K. Smith C.D. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5962-5969PubMed Google Scholar). These authors demonstrated that SKi is relatively specific for SK, with no activity against ERK-2, PI3K, or PKCα (18French K.J. Schrecengost R.S. Lee B.D. Zhuang Y. Smith S.N. Eberly J.L. Yun J.K.

Zhuang Y. Smith S.N. Eberly J.L. Yun J.K. Smith C.D. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5962-5969PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, our findings confirm that SKi induces the onset of apoptosis of MCF-7 Neo cells (12Loveridge C. Tonelli F. Leclecq T. Lim K.G. Long. S. Berdyshev E. Tate R.J. Natarajan V. Pitson Pyne N.J.

A role for SK1 in regulating the survival of MCF-7 breast cancer cells was also evident by studies of Taha et al. (24Taha T.A. Kitatani K. El-Alwani M. Bielawski J. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 482-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that siRNA knockdown of SK1 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells induced apoptosis. This involves caspase activation and is associated with increased ceramide formation and Bax oligomerization. Treatment of MCF-7 Neo and MCF-7 HER218 cells with SKi, FTY720, or (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate induced the proteasomal degradation of SK1. The ability of SK1 inhibitors to induce proteasomal degradation of SK1 and to exhibit high efficacy killing of cancer cells is likely dependent on the specific adopted inhibitor-SK1 conformation. This conformation might result in different extents of unfolding of SK1 required for polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. This proteasomal degradation is also stimulated in a ceramide-dependent manner due to acute inhibition of SK1 catalytic activity by the inhibitor as we demonstrated previously (12Loveridge C. Tonelli F. Leclecq T. Lim K.G. Long. S. Berdyshev E. Tate R.J. Natarajan V. Pitson Pyne N.J. Pyne S. J. Biol.

SKi is an effective anticancer agent in vivo and inhibits tumor growth (syngenic tumor model with mammary adenocarcinoma cells) and inflammation (ulcerative colitis model) (23French K.J. Upson J.J.

Mol. Cancer Ther. 2005; 4: 1430-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In light of our current findings, it remains to be determined whether the in vivo efficacy in cancer models of SKi and FTY720 is related to the ability of these compounds to inhibit SK1 catalytic activity and/or to induce proteasomal degradation of SK1. In conclusion, the removal of SK1 from cancer cells by SK1 inhibitors suggests that the efficacy and duration of action of these compounds in inducing apoptosis might be significantly superior compared with compounds that simply reversibly inhibit enzyme catalytic activity and are therefore short acting. Moreover, the presence of a putative allosteric site(s) in SK1 offers opportunities for the implementation of new drug discovery programs. Taken together, these findings provide impetus for developing SK1 inhibitors, e.g. by using (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate as the prototype, as putative anticancer agents, not least because their mechanism of action should enable fewer administrations to the patient and development of resistance might be impaired, thereby opening new avenues for combination therapies.

https://openalex.org/W2041035942,"Polysialic acid (polySia), a unique acidic glycan modifying neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), is known to regulate embryonic neural development and adult brain functions. Polysialyltransferase STX is responsible for the synthesis of polySia, and two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the coding region of STX are reported from schizophrenic patients: SNP7 and SNP9, respectively, giving STX(G421A) with E141K and STX(C621G) with silent mutations. In this study, we focused on these mutations and a binding activity of polySia to neural materials, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Here we describe three new findings. First, STX(G421A) shows a dramatic decrease in polySia synthetic activity on NCAM, whereas STX(C621G) does not. The STX(G421A)-derived polySia-NCAM contains a lower amount of polySia with a shorter chain length. Second, polySia shows a dopamine (DA) binding activity, which is a new function of polySia as revealed by frontal affinity chromatography for measuring the polySia-neurotransmitter interactions. Interestingly, the STX(G421A)-derived polySia-NCAM completely loses the DA binding activity, whereas it greatly diminishes but does not lose the BDNF binding activity. Third, an impairment of the polySia structure with an endosialidase modulates the DA-mediated Akt signaling. Taken together, impairment of the amount and quality of polySia may be involved in psychiatric disorders through impaired binding to BDNF and DA, which are deeply involved in schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders, such as depression and bipolar disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2007794074,"A micro-RNA, miR-155, is overexpressed in many types of cancer cells, including breast cancer, and its role(s) in tumor metastasis has been studied on a very limited basis. Tumor metastasis is a multi-step process with the last step in the process being formation of macroscopic tumor in organs distant from the primary tumor site. This step is the least studied. Here, we report that stable expression of miR-155 in 4T1 breast tumor cells reduces significantly the aggressiveness of tumor cell dissemination as a result of preventing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of tumor cells in vivo. Further, miR-155 directly suppresses the expression of the transcription factor TCF4, which is an important regulator of EMT. However, when tumor cells are injected directly into the bloodstream, miR-155 remarkably promotes macroscopic tumor formation in the lung. Analysis of gene expression profiling identified a group of genes that are associated with promoting macroscopic tumor formation in the lung. Importantly, most of these genes are overexpressed in epithelial cells. Our findings provide new insight into how miR-155 modulates the development of tumor metastasis. This study suggests that the location of tumor cells overexpressing miR-155 is a critical factor: in mammary fat pads miR-155 prevents tumor dissemination; whereas in the lung miR-155 apparently maintains the epithelial phenotype of tumor cells that is critical for macroscopic tumor formation."
https://openalex.org/W2017784759,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a highly conserved serine–threonine kinase activated in response to growth factors and nutrients. Because of frequent dysregulation of the mTOR signaling pathway in diverse human cancers, this kinase is a key therapeutic target. Redd1 is a negative regulator of mTOR, mediating dissociation of 14-3-3 from tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)2, which allows formation of a TSC–TSC2 complex. In the present study, we identify TXNIP that inhibits mTOR activity by binding to and stabilizing Redd1 protein. Redd1 and TXNIP expression was induced by a synthetic glucose analog, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG). Moreover, Redd1 expression in response to 2-DG was regulated by activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Overexpression of TXNIP was associated with reduced mTOR activity mediated by an increase in Redd1 level, whereas knockdown of TXNIP using small interfering RNA resulted in recovery of mTOR activity via downregulation of Redd1 during treatment with 2-DG. Interestingly, Redd1 was additionally stabilized via interactions with N-terminal-truncated TXNIP, leading to suppression of mTOR activity. Our results collectively demonstrate that TXNIP stabilizes Redd1 protein induced by ATF4 in response to 2-DG, resulting in potentiation of mTOR suppression. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to identify TXNIP as a novel member of the mTOR upstream that acts as a negative regulator in response to stress signals."
https://openalex.org/W1980834304,"Macrophages activated through Toll receptor triggering increase the expression of the A(2A) and A(2B) adenosine receptors. In this study, we show that adenosine receptor activation enhances LPS-induced pfkfb3 expression, resulting in an increase of the key glycolytic allosteric regulator fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and the glycolytic flux. Using shRNA and differential expression of A(2A) and A(2B) receptors, we demonstrate that the A(2A) receptor mediates, in part, the induction of pfkfb3 by LPS, whereas the A(2B) receptor, with lower adenosine affinity, cooperates when high adenosine levels are present. pfkfb3 promoter sequence deletion analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, and inhibition by shRNAs demonstrated that HIF1α is a key transcription factor driving pfkfb3 expression following macrophage activation by LPS, whereas synergic induction of pfkfb3 expression observed with the A(2) receptor agonists seems to depend on Sp1 activity. Furthermore, levels of phospho-AMP kinase also increase, arguing for increased PFKFB3 activity by phosphorylation in long term LPS-activated macrophages. Taken together, our results show that, in macrophages, endogenously generated adenosine cooperates with bacterial components to increase PFKFB3 isozyme activity, resulting in greater fructose 2,6-bisphosphate accumulation. This process enhances the glycolytic flux and favors ATP generation helping to develop and maintain the long term defensive and reparative functions of the macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2041949992,"The introduction of the Simian virus 40 (SV40) early region, the telomerase catalytic subunit (hTERT) and an oncogenic allele of H-Ras directly transforms primary human cells. SV40 small T antigen (ST), which forms a complex with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and inhibits PP2A activity, is believed to have a critical role in the malignant transformation of human cells. Recent evidence has shown that aberrant microRNA (miRNA) expression patterns are correlated with cancer development. Here, we identified miR-27a as a differentially expressed miRNA in SV40 ST-expressing cells. miR-27a is upregulated in SV40 ST-transformed human bronchial epithelial cells (HBERST). Suppression of miR-27a expression in HBERST cells or lung cancer cell lines (NCI-H226 and SK-MES-1) that exhibited high levels of miR-27a expression lead to cell growth arrested in the G0–G1 phase. In addition, suppression of miR-27a in HBERST cells attenuated the capacity of such cells to grow in an anchorage-independent manner. We also found that suppression of the PP2A B56γ expression resulted in upregulation of miR-27a similar to that achieved by the introduction of ST, indicating that dysregulation of miR-27a expression in ST-expressing cells was mediated by the ST–PP2A interaction. Moreover, we discovered that Fbxw7 gene encoding F-box/WD repeat-containing protein 7 was a potential miR-27a target validated by dual-luciferase reporter system analysis. The inverse correlation between miR-27a expression levels and Fbxw7 protein expression was further confirmed in both cell models and human tumor samples. Fbxw7 regulates cell-cycle progression through the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of a set of substrates, including c-Myc, c-Jun, cyclin E1 and Notch 1. Thus, promotion of cell growth arising from the suppression of Fbxw7 by miR-27a overexpression might be responsible for the viral oncoprotein ST-induced malignant transformation. These observations demonstrate that miR-27a functions as an oncogene in human tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2030338099,"Protein synthesis and secretion are essential to cellular life. Although secretory activities may vary in different cell types, what determines the maximum secretory capacity is inherently difficult to study. Increasing protein synthesis until reaching the limit of secretory capacity is one strategy to address this key issue. Under highly optimized growth conditions, recombinant CHO cells engineered to produce a model human IgG clone started housing rod-shaped crystals in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen. The intra-ER crystal growth was accompanied by cell enlargement and multinucleation and continued until crystals outgrew cell size to breach membrane integrity. The intra-ER crystals were composed of correctly folded, endoglycosidase H-sensitive IgG. Crystallizing propensity was due to the intrinsic physicochemical properties of the model IgG, and the crystallization was reproduced in vitro by exposing a high concentration of IgG to a near neutral pH. The striking cellular phenotype implicated the efficiency of IgG protein synthesis and oxidative folding exceeded the capacity of ER export machinery. As a result, export-ready IgG accumulated progressively in the ER lumen until a threshold concentration was reached to nucleate crystals. Using an in vivo system that reports accumulation of correctly folded IgG, we showed that the ER-to-Golgi transport steps became rate-limiting in cells with high secretory activity."
https://openalex.org/W1994212910,"Social insects provide good model systems for testing trade-offs in decision-making because of their marked reproductive skew and the dilemma workers face when to reproduce. Attaining reproductive skew requires energy investment in aggression or fertility signaling, creating a trade-off between reproduction and dominance. This may be density-dependent because the cost of achieving dominance may be higher in larger groups. We investigated the effect of group-size in B. terrestris queenless workers on two major reproduction-dominance correlates: between-worker aggression, and pheromone production, aiming at mimicking decision-making during the transition of worker behavior from cooperation and sterility to aggressive reproductive competition in whole colonies. Despite the competition, reproductive division of labor in colonies can be maintained even during this phase through the production of a sterility signal by sterile workers that has an appeasement effect on dominant nestmates. Worker-worker aggression, ovary activation, and production of sterility-appeasement signals may therefore constitute components of a trade-off affecting worker reproduction decisions. By constructing queenless groups of different size and measuring how this affected the parameters above, we found that in all groups aggression was not evenly distributed with the α-worker performing most of the aggressive acts. Moreover, aggression by the α-worker increased proportionally with group-size. However, while in small groups the α-worker monopolized reproduction, in larger groups several workers shared reproduction, creating two worker groups: reproductives and helpers. It appears that despite the increase of aggression, this was evidently not sufficient for the α-worker to monopolize reproduction. If we compare the α-worker to the queen in full-sized colonies it can be hypothesized that worker reproduction in B. terrestris colonies starts due to a gradual increase in the worker population and the queen's inability to physically inhibit worker oviposition. This may shift the trade-off between cost and benefit of worker reproduction and trigger the competition phase."
https://openalex.org/W1983144751,"One of the long-standing paradoxes in genomic evolution is the observation that much of the genome is composed of repetitive DNA which has been typically regarded as superfluous to the function of the genome in generating phenotypes.

For this, we have constructed a phylogenetic tree of these species, estimated GS and FD of them, inferred the tempo and mode of evolution of these traits and their correlations, using both current and phylogenetically independent contrasted values. We found significant correlations among the traits, when considering the complete set of data or only the subgenus Passiflora, whereas no correlations were observed within Decaloba. Herein, we present convincing evidence of adaptive evolution of GS, as well as clues that this pattern is limited by a minimum genome size, which could reduce both the possibilities of changes in GS and the possibility of phenotypic responses to environment changes."

We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing a Pharmacy-only Refill Program (PRP), a form of task-shifting, to the Standard of Care (SOC) at a large HIV/AIDS clinic in Uganda, the Infectious Diseases Institute (IDI). The PRP was started to reduce workforce shortages and optimize patient care by substituting pharmacy visits for SOC involving monthly physician visits for accessing antiretroviral medicines. Methodology/Principal Findings We used a retrospective cohort analysis to compare the effectiveness of the PRP compared to SOC. Effectiveness was defined as Favorable Immune Response (FIR), measured as having a CD4 lymphocyte count of over 500 cells/µl at follow-up. We used multivariate logistic regression to assess the difference in FIR between patients in the PRP and SOC. We incorporated estimates of effectiveness into an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis performed from a limited societal perspective. We estimated costs from previous studies at IDI and conducted univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. We identified 829 patients, 578 in the PRP and 251 in SOC. After 12.8 months (PRP) and 15.1 months (SOC) of follow-up, 18.9% of patients had a FIR, 18.6% in the PRP and 19.6% in SOC. There was a non-significant 9% decrease in the odds of having a FIR for PRP compared to SOC after adjusting for other variables (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.55–1.58). The PRP was less costly than the SOC (US$ 520 vs. 655 annually, respectively). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio comparing PRP to SOC was US$ 13,500 per FIR. PRP remained cost-effective at univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Conclusion/Significance The PRP is more cost-effective than the standard of care. Similar task-shifting programs might help large HIV/AIDS clinics in Uganda and other low-income countries to cope with increasing numbers of patients seeking care."

Our data suggest that, in mammalian cells, both monoubiquitination and endocytosis are required before γ-secretase cleavage of ligand-activated Notch (10Gupta-Rossi N. Six E. LeBail O. Logeat F. Chastagner P. Olry A. Israël A. Brou C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar).As the Notch pathway is conserved throughout evolution, we scanned the literature for genetic modulators of the pathway in invertebrates to further understand the intracellular events that control Notch activation. Loss of worm sel-5 (SEL for suppressor/enhancer of Lin12) results in suppression of the constitutive activity of lin-12(d) (equivalent to the metalloprotease-cleaved Notch or ΔE construct) but not of lin-12(intra) (corresponding to the γ-secretase released nuclear form of Notch) (19Fares H. Greenwald I. Genetics. 1999; 153: 1641-1654PubMed Google Scholar). SEL-5 kinase is the homolog of Drosophila NAK, Numb-associated kinase (20Chien C.T. Wang S. Rothenberg M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 598-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and human AAK1, adaptor-associated kinase 1 (21Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. J.

Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 791-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). These serine/threonine kinases belong to the Ark1/Prk1 (actin-regulating kinase 1) family involved in cortical actin regulation in yeast and include BIKE (BMP-2-inducible kinase), MPSK1 (myristoylated and palmitoylated serine/threonine kinase 1) and GAK (23Cope M.J.

Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6126) Google Scholar). AAK1 and GAK, the cyclin G-associated kinase, phosphorylate the μ subunits of both AP-1 and AP-2 trafficking adaptors (21Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 22Ricotta D. Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. von Figura K. Honing S. J.

AAK1, via phosphorylation of Thr-156 of the μ2 subunit, increases the affinity of AP2 for membranes and induces a conformational change enabling cargo recruitment by this adaptor (26Collins B.M. McCoy A.J. Kent H.M. Evans P.R. Owen D.J. Cell. 2002; 109: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 27Höning S. Ricotta D. Krauss M. Späte K. Spolaore B. Motley A. Robinson M. Robinson C. Haucke V. Owen D.J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 519-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Clathrin assembly stimulates AAK1 activity thus suggesting a role in clathrin-mediated cargo uptake (28Conner S.D. Schröter T. Schmid S.L. Traffic. 2003; 4: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 29Jackson A.P. Flett A. Smythe C. Hufton L. Wettey F.R. Smythe E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Besides its function at the internalization step, AAK1 was recently shown to act at the level of early/sorting endosome and to colocalize with EEA1 (30Henderson D.M. Conner S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2698-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Based on these observations as well as on the genetic data obtained in invertebrates, we hypothesized that AAK1 could play a positive role in early Notch endocytosis.Results presented here show that AAK1 directly interacts with Notch ΔE, a membrane-tethered and activated form of Notch that resembles the ligand-induced metalloprotease-processing product, but does not interact with the full-length receptor. Further investigation reveals that increasing AAK1 expression results in stabilization of Notch ΔE and its monoubiquitinated form. Moreover, shRNA-mediated AAK1 depletion decreases Notch transcriptional activity in coculture experiments. It has been shown that AAK1 can phosphorylate Numb, a negative regulator of the Notch pathway, and modify its subcellular localization (31Sorensen E.B. Conner S.D. Traffic. 2008; 9: 1791-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that AAK1 targets Notch to Rab5-positive endosomes, whereas Numb interferes with this localization. Based on these results we propose that after activation by its ligand, AAK1 promotes Notch activation through stabilization of the monoubiquitinated Notch intermediate and sorting toward Rab5-positive endosomes. On the other hand, Numb interferes with the monoubiquitination step and the Rab5 localization, probably leading to Notch degradation through an alternate sorting pathway.DISCUSSIONIncreasing evidence indicates that Notch signaling is controlled by ubiquitination and endocytic events (8Bray S.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 678-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1931) Google Scholar, 11Nichols J.T. Miyamoto A. Weinmaster G.

Dynamin is clearly involved in Notch receptor signaling (12Seugnet L. Simpson P. Haenlin M. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 585-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) but the exact molecular mechanisms underlying Notch trafficking are still under investigation. Different proteins belonging to the CME pathway have been involved in Notch trafficking in mammals: α-adaptin, Numb, Eps15, and clathrin (10Gupta-Rossi N. Six E. LeBail O. Logeat F. Chastagner P. Olry A. Israël A. Brou C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 55Santolini E. Puri C. Salcini A.E. Gagliani M.C. Pelicci P.G. Tacchetti C. Di Fiore P.P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1345-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Recently, signaling by Notch was confirmed to be clathrin-dependent but not AP2-dependent in Drosophila ovary (56Windler S.L. Bilder D. Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 538-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).Our previous study had shown that, in mammalian cells, a monoubiquitination step on a juxtamembrane lysine was required for further cleavage of Notch by γ-secretase and activation of the pathway (10Gupta-Rossi N. Six E. LeBail O. Logeat F. Chastagner P. Olry A. Israël A. Brou C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that the human ortholog of Drosophila NAK and worm SEL-5 (19Fares H. Greenwald I. Genetics. 1999; 153: 1641-1654PubMed Google Scholar, 20Chien C.T. Wang S. Rothenberg M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 598-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), AAK1, acts as a positive regulator of Notch signaling in mammalian cells, similar to its invertebrate counterparts. AAK1 is involved in CME through phosphorylation of the μ2 subunit of the AP2 adaptor (21Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 22Ricotta D. Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. von Figura K. Honing S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 791-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), but silencing of this kinase interferes with some AP2-independent events: accumulation of transferrin receptor in perinuclear endosomes, reduced viral entry of vesicular stomatitis virus and inhibition of LDL uptake (30Henderson D.M. Conner S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2698-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 57Pelkmans L. Fava E. Grabner H. Hannus M. Habermann B. Krausz E. Zerial M. Nature. 2005; 436: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that AAK1 directly interacts with ligand-activated Notch (represented here by the ΔE molecule) but not with the inactive full-length receptor. AAK1 interacts with a domain spanning the ankyrin repeats of Notch. AAK1 action on the Notch pathway is unconventional in the sense that its kinase activity is required, but not through direct phosphorylation of the receptor itself.AAK1 overexpression results in stabilization of activated Notch but not of the inactive receptor. This stabilization results in an increased level of the monoubiquitinated form of ΔE (ΔEU), which precedes the critical γ-secretase cleavage (10Gupta-Rossi N. Six E. LeBail O. Logeat F. Chastagner P. Olry A. Israël A. Brou C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). HeLa cells predominantly express the AAK1L splice variant of AAK1 (30Henderson D.M. Conner S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2698-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), which exhibits an additional clathrin-binding domain but is functionally equivalent to AAK1. We observed an interaction between endogenous AAK1L and transfected Notch ΔE. The AAK1 kinase activity does not seem to be required for ΔE monoubiquitination, but a transfected kinase dead mutant interacts less efficiently with the monoubiquitinated form of ΔE and leads to reduced Notch activity. A conformational switch between the active and the inactive forms of the kinase may explain these results, as the inactive kinase may not enable interaction with other endocytic adaptors (28Conner S.D. Schröter T. Schmid S.L. Traffic. 2003; 4: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and consequent stabilization of monoubiquitinated Notch. Clathrin binding is known to stimulate AAK1 kinase activity and promote cargo recruitment into coated pits (28Conner S.D. Schröter T. Schmid S.L. Traffic. 2003; 4: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 29Jackson A.P. Flett A. Smythe C. Hufton L. Wettey F.R. Smythe E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). AAK1 also exhibits multiple binding sites for accessory endocytic components such as AP2 and EH-containing proteins (21Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 22Ricotta D. Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. von Figura K. Honing S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 791-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and thus acts as a scaffolding hub for the recruitment of several endocytic partners. Notch could thus be targeted to clathrin-coated pits by AAK1. AAK1 fulfills all the requirements of a bona fide endocytic adaptor (58Wendland B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) of Notch: it can bind directly the Notch cargo at the cell surface and interacts with clathrin and other endocytic partners.We have previously shown that dominant-negative Eps15 inhibits the cleavage of Notch ΔE. It now appears that Eps15b, an Eps15 isoform that lacks EH-domains (48Roxrud I. Raiborg C. Pedersen N.M. Stang E. Stenmark H. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 1205-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), interacts with AAK1 in fibroblasts. Eps15b is the only Eps15 isoform found in AAK1 pull-down, as antibodies against Eps-15 EH-domains did not reveal any additional partner (6G4 antibody, (59Benmerah A. Gagnon J. Bègue B. Mégarbané B. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar)). Whereas one of the DPF-motifs of AAK1 seems to be directly or indirectly involved in AAK1-Eps15b interaction, mutation of the EH domain-binding NPF motif did not interfere with this interaction (45Salcini A.E. Confalonieri S. Doria M. Santolini E. Tassi E. Minenkova O. Cesareni G. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2239-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Both Eps15 and Eps15b contain an ubiquitin-interacting motif that directly recognizes monoubiquitinated cargos (47Polo S. Sigismund S. Faretta M. Guidi M. Capua M.R. Bossi G. Chen H. De Camilli P. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 48Roxrud I. Raiborg C. Pedersen N.M. Stang E. Stenmark H. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 1205-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 60Shih S.C. Katzmann D.J. Schnell J.D. Sutanto M. Emr S.D. Hicke L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Eps15 colocalizes with AP2 at the plasma membrane but Eps15b is localized in EEA1-positive early endosomes (48Roxrud I. Raiborg C. Pedersen N.M. Stang E. Stenmark H. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 1205-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Monoubiquitinated Notch could thus interact with Eps15b and be further sorted to late endosomal structures. Interestingly, AAK1 is itself ubiquitinated (Fig. 3C) and colocalizes with EEA1 (30Henderson D.M. Conner S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2698-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that an AAK1/Eps15b/Notch ΔE complex may form in such structures. Further experiments will determine if Eps15b functions as a sorting signal for monoubiquitinated Notch cargo toward late endosomal structures.Numb is another endocytic protein that acts as a Notch inhibitor via binding to AP2 in coated pits (14Berdnik D. Török T. González-Gaitán M. Knoblich J.A. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 55Santolini E. Puri C. Salcini A.E. Gagliani M.C. Pelicci P.G. Tacchetti C. Di Fiore P.P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1345-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 61Guo M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Neuron. 1996; 17: 27-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The C terminus of Numb was shown to be essential for Notch repression in Drosophila cells (49Frise E. Knoblich J.A. Younger-Shepherd S. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 11925-11932Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), in agreement with the presence of conserved endocytic NPF- and DPF-motifs (55Santolini E. Puri C. Salcini A.E. Gagliani M.C. Pelicci P.G. Tacchetti C. Di Fiore P.P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1345-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). We present data showing that Numb and AAK1 differentially regulate ΔE. Contrary to AAK1, Numb inhibits ΔE monoubiquitination probably favoring polyubiquitination. Of note, in cells cotransfected with AAK1 and Numb, ΔEU was successfully pulled-down with AAK1 but not with Numb (data not shown). These results correlate with published data showing that Numb promotes Notch degradation through AIP4-mediated polyubiquitination (50McGill M.A. McGlade C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23196-23203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 51McGill M.A. Dho S.E. Weinmaster G. McGlade C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 26427-26438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 62Chastagner P. Israël A. Brou C. PLoS. ONE. 2008; 3: e2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). AAK1 and Numb act antagonistically, probably by inducing different sorting events through recruitment of alternate accessory factors. AAK1 could have a double role in these events: phosphorylation and redistribution of Numb to recycling endosomes on one hand (31Sorensen E.B. Conner S.D. Traffic. 2008; 9: 1791-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); recruitment of Eps15b and stabilization of ΔE/ΔEU on the other hand. Numb phosphorylation releases it from clathrin-coated pits (63Nishimura T. Kaibuchi K. Dev. Cell. 2007; 13: 15-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 64Tokumitsu H. Hatano N. Yokokura S. Sueyoshi Y. Nozaki N. Kobayashi R. FEBS. Lett. 2006; 580: 5797-5801Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore, Numb phosphorylation may act as an important regulatory process in the Notch pathway. Use of Numb phospho-mutants will allow a better understanding of these events and their contribution to Notch signaling.To understand the relationship between endocytosis and monoubiquitination of activated Notch, we used a lysine-mutated form of ΔE that was resistant to monoubiquitination (10Gupta-Rossi N. Six E. LeBail O. Logeat F. Chastagner P. Olry A. Israël A. Brou C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We observed an accumulation of this mutant in EEA1-positive endosomes (data not shown) suggesting that internalization can take place before monoubiquitination. In germline cells of flies, Rab5 overexpression results in the accumulation of Notch in enlarged Rab5-positive structures (65Wilkin M. Tongngok P. Gensch N. Clemence S. Motoki M. Yamada K. Hori K. Taniguchi-Kanai M. Franklin E. Matsuno K. Baron M. Dev. Cell. 2008; 15: 762-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We show here that AAK1 colocalizes with ΔE in Rab5Q79L endosomes whereas overexpression of Numb interferes with this routing. This observation was confirmed by knocking-down Numb or AAK1: Numb knockdown enhanced ΔE/Rab5Q79L colocalization (recovery of 90% colocalization) whereas AAK1 depletion disorganized the Rab5 structures and reduced the presence of ΔE in these endosomes (<10% ΔE/Rab5Q-positive vesicles).We can therefore propose a model involving differential sorting of activated Notch, depending on the presence of specific endocytic factors (13Vaccari T. Lu H. Kanwar R. Fortini M.E. Bilder D. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 54Yamamoto S. Charng W.L. Bellen H.J. Curr. Top Dev. Biol. 2010; 92: 165-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Ligand-induced Notch cleavage by a metalloprotease (giving rise to a molecule similar to ΔETM) is followed by AAK1 binding. AAK1 then phosphorylates Numb, leading to its dissociation from the plasma membrane and from Notch. Actived Notch can then be endocytosed through clathrin-coated pits via active AAK1. Notch monoubiquitination then takes place in EEA1-positive early endosomes and the Notch/AAK1 complex probably includes additional factors such as Eps15b. Of note, Rab5Q79L-generated EEA1 positive enlarged endosomes were also shown to contain Eps15b (48Roxrud I. Raiborg C. Pedersen N.M. Stang E. Stenmark H. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 1205-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and may thus account for the presence of activated Notch, probably monoubiquitinated, there. Further processing of Notch by the γ-secretase can then occur and lead to Notch transcriptional activation. In the absence of AAK1, Numb leads to polyubiquitination and degradation of Notch, therefore precluding further Notch activation. An alternate model would be that AAK1 acts only after Notch has been endocytosed. Competition between AAK1 and Numb for Notch could then occur later in the EE and sort the receptor to late endosomal structures such as lysosomes or MVBs (via Numb) or another compartment where γ-secretase is present and active (via AAK1). In this model the observed AAK1 interaction restricted to activated Notch can only be explained by a different localization of the inactive Notch (at the plasma-membrane) versus the activated membrane-tethered form (endosomal).Our results show that fine-tuning of the level of two endocytic adaptors can account for the differential sorting of the Notch receptor: AAK1 leading to activation and Numb involving degradation. Further investigation will determine the other components that regulate this differential sorting of activated Notch. IntroductionThe Notch gene encodes a receptor, matured by furin, and present at the cell surface as an heterodimer (1Blaumueller C.M. Qi H. Zagouras P. Artavanis-Tsakonas S.

Notch activation is induced upon ligand binding and leads to its extracellular cleavage by TNF-α-converting enzyme (TACE) 2The abbreviations used are: TACE, TNF-α-converting enzyme; CME, clathrin-mediated endocytosis; CSL, CBF1/Su(H)/Lag2; DAPT, N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl-l-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine tert-butyl ester; EEA1, early endosome antigen 1; TfR, transferrin receptor.

The released intracellular domain of Notch translocates to the nucleus and induces transcription of target genes together with the CSL and Mastermind cofactors. Ligand-induced activation of Notch is strictly regulated at several levels, both at the extracellular and the intracellular levels (5Tien A.C. Rajan A. Bellen H.J. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 6Gupta-Rossi N. Le Bail O. Gonen H. Brou C. Logeat F. Six E. Ciechanover A. Israël A. J. Biol.

Cell. 2009; 137: 216-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2494) Google Scholar).An increasing number of data reveals that the activity of both Notch receptor and its ligands is regulated by internalization as well as ubiquitination events (8Bray S.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 678-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1931) Google Scholar, 9Le Borgne R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A large repertoire of Notch pathway regulators has been identified, mainly in invertebrates, and conflicting data have emerged regarding Notch activity and trafficking (5Tien A.C. Rajan A. Bellen H.J. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). On one hand, endocytosis appears important for Notch activation in the signal-receiving cell (10Gupta-Rossi N. Six E. LeBail O. Logeat F. Chastagner P. Olry A. Israël A. Brou C. J.

https://openalex.org/W1522484198,"Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a family of heterotrimeric protein phosphatases that has a multitude of functions inside the cell, acting through various substrate targets in cell-signaling pathways. Recent evidence suggests that a subset of PP2A holoenzymes function as tumor suppressors and one particular family of B subunits, B56, are implicated in this function. However, the regulatory mechanisms that govern activation of B56-PP2A tumor-suppressive function have not been elucidated. In the present study, we demonstrate that ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) directly phosphorylates and specifically regulates B56γ3, B56γ2 and B56δ, after DNA damage. We further show that phosphorylation of B56γ3 at Ser510 leads to an increase in B56γ3-PP2A complexes, and direction of PP2A phosphatase activity toward the substrate p53, activating its tumor-suppressive functions. In addition, we found that under cell growth conditions B56γ3 is kept at low levels through the actions of the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2, and, importantly, phosphorylation of B56γ3 by ATM leads to upregulation of the protein by blocking MDM2-mediated B56γ3 ubiquitination. Finally, we show that Ser510 phosphorylation significantly enhances the ability of B56γ3 to inhibit cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth. These results provide mechanistic insight into the regulation of PP2A tumor-suppressive function, and suggest a model for parallel regulation of p53 and B56γ3."

Four protons are released during one turnover of the water oxidation cycle (S-state cycle), implying thermodynamic limitations at low pH. For proton concentrations ranging from 1 nm (pH 9) to 1 mm (pH 3), we have characterized the low-pH limitations using a new experimental approach: a specific pH-jump protocol combined with time-resolved measurement of the delayed chlorophyll fluorescence after nanosecond flash excitation. Effective pK values were determined for low-pH inhibition of the light-induced S-state transitions: pK(1)=3.3 ± 0.3, pK(2)=3.5 ± 0.2, and pK(3)≈pK(4)=4.6 ± 0.2. Alkaline inhibition was not observed. An extension of the classical Kok model facilitated assignment of these four pK values to specific deprotonation steps in the reaction cycle. Our results provide important support to the extended S-state cycle model and criteria needed for assessment of quantum chemical calculations of the mechanism of water oxidation. They also imply that, in intact organisms, the pH in the lumen compartment can hardly drop below 5, thereby limiting the ΔpH contribution to the driving force of ATP synthesis."

We have developed a novel IGF-I variant by site-specific addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to lysine 68 (PEG-IGF-I). In vitro, this modification decreased the affinity for the IGF-I and insulin receptors, presumably through decreased association rates, and slowed down the association to IGF-I-binding proteins, selectively limiting fast but maintaining sustained anabolic activity. Desirable in vivo effects of PEG-IGF-I included increased half-life and recruitment of IGF-binding proteins, thereby reducing risk of hypoglycemia. PEG-IGF-I was equipotent to IGF-I in ameliorating contraction-induced muscle injury in vivo without affecting muscle metabolism as IGF-I did. The data provide an important step in understanding the differences of IGF-I and insulin receptor contribution to the in vivo activity of IGF-I.

https://openalex.org/W1987191213,"Secretory clusterin (sCLU) is a stress-induced, pro-survival glycoprotein elevated in early-stage cancers, in particular in APC/Min-defective colon cancers. sCLU is upregulated after exposure to various cytotoxic agents, including ionizing radiation (IR), leading to a survival advantage. We found that stimulation of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and IGF-1R protein kinase signaling was required for sCLU induction after IR exposure. Here, we show that activation of Ataxia telangiectasia-mutated kinase (ATM) by endogenous or exogenous forms of DNA damage was required to relieve basal repression of IGF-1 transcription by the p53/NF-YA complex, leading to sCLU expression. Although p53 levels were stabilized and elevated after DNA damage, dissociation of NF-YA, and thereby p53, from the IGF-1 promoter resulted in IGF-1 induction, indicating that NF-YA was rate limiting. Cells with elevated endogenous DNA damage (deficient in H2AX, MDC1, NBS1, mTR or hMLH1) or cells exposed to DNA-damaging agents had elevated IGF-1 expression, resulting in activation of IGF-1R signaling and sCLU induction. In contrast, ATM-deficient cells were unable to induce sCLU after DNA damage. Our results integrate DNA damage resulting from genetic instability, IR, or chemotherapeutic agents, to ATM activation and abrogation of p53/NF-YA-mediated IGF-1 transcriptional repression, that induces IGF-1-sCLU expression. Elucidation of this pathway should uncover new mechanisms for cancer progression and reveal new targets for drug development to overcome resistance to therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2087354432,"S-Palmitoylation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is a prevalent modification, contributing to the regulation of receptor function. Despite its importance, the palmitoylation status of the β1-adrenergic receptor, a GPCR critical for heart function, has never been determined. We report here that the β1-adrenergic receptor is palmitoylated on three cysteine residues at two sites in the C-terminal tail. One site (proximal) is adjacent to the seventh transmembrane domain and is a consensus site for GPCRs, and the other (distal) is downstream. These sites are modified in different cellular compartments, and the distal palmitoylation site contributes to efficient internalization of the receptor following agonist stimulation. Using a bioorthogonal palmitate reporter to quantify palmitoylation accurately, we found that the rates of palmitate turnover at each site are dramatically different. Although palmitoylation at the proximal site is remarkably stable, palmitoylation at the distal site is rapidly turned over. This is the first report documenting differential dynamics of palmitoylation sites in a GPCR.

https://openalex.org/W2021910201,"Kallikrein 6 (KLK6) is a newly identified member of the kallikrein family of secreted serine proteases that prior studies indicate is elevated at sites of central nervous system (CNS) inflammation and which shows regulated expression with T cell activation. Notably, KLK6 is also elevated in the serum of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients however its potential roles in immune function are unknown. Herein we specifically examine whether KLK6 alters immune cell survival and the possible mechanism by which this may occur.Using murine whole splenocyte preparations and the human Jurkat T cell line we demonstrate that KLK6 robustly supports cell survival across a range of cell death paradigms. Recombinant KLK6 was shown to significantly reduce cell death under resting conditions and in response to camptothecin, dexamethasone, staurosporine and Fas-ligand. Moreover, KLK6-over expression in Jurkat T cells was shown to generate parallel pro-survival effects. In mixed splenocyte populations the vigorous immune cell survival promoting effects of KLK6 were shown to include both T and B lymphocytes, to occur with as little as 5 minutes of treatment, and to involve up regulation of the pro-survival protein B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-XL), and inhibition of the pro-apoptotic protein Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death (Bim). The ability of KLK6 to promote survival of splenic T cells was also shown to be absent in cell preparations derived from PAR1 deficient mice.KLK6 promotes lymphocyte survival by a mechanism that depends in part on activation of PAR1. These findings point to a novel molecular mechanism regulating lymphocyte survival that is likely to have relevance to a range of immunological responses that depend on apoptosis for immune clearance and maintenance of homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2093199109,"Deregulation of RNA polymerase III (Pol III) transcription enhances cellular tRNAs and 5S rRNA production, leading to an increase in translational capacity to promote cell proliferation, transformation and tumor formation. Phosphorylation of histone H3 (H3ph) is induced by tumor promoters (EGF, UV and TPA) and immediate early genes, such as c-myc, c-jun and c-fos. However, it remains to be determined whether H3ph is involved in RNA Pol III transcription. Here, we report that EGF strongly induced H3ph at serine 28 (H3S28ph). EGF significantly increased transcription of RNA Pol III-dependent genes (Pol III genes), tRNA(Leu), tRNA(Tyr), 5S rRNA and 7SL RNA. Inhibition of EGFR, but not PI3K, reduced both H3S28ph and tRNA(Leu) and 5S rRNA transcription. EGF enhanced occupancy of H3S28ph in the promoters of tRNA(Leu) and 5S rRNA. Further analysis indicates that EGF augmented cellular levels of protein and mRNA of TFIIIB subunits, Brf1 and TATA box-binding protein (TBP). Brf1 is a specific transcription factor for RNA Pol III genes. EGF enhanced occupancy of H3S28ph in the Brf1 and TBP promoters. Inhibition of H3S28ph by mutant H3S28A repressed Brf1, TBP and tRNA(Leu) and 5S rRNA expression and decreased occupancy of H3S28ph in their promoters. Reduction of Brf1 significantly decreased tRNA(Leu) and 5S rRNA transcription and repressed EGF-induced anchorage-independent growth. Blocking H3S28ph signaling by using mutant H3S28A reduced EGF-induced cell transformation. Together, these results indicate that EGF activates EGFR signaling to induce H3S28ph, which, in turn, upregulates tRNA(Leu) and 5S rRNA transcription through Brf1 and TBP and promotes cell transformation. The studies demonstrate that epigenetic modification of H3S28ph has a critical role in the activity of Pol III genes."

These mutations have been described as suppressors of ASP action, blocking its antagonizing effects on the melanocortin 1 and 4 receptors (MC1R and MC4R) in the skin and the brain, respectively, via unknown mechanisms. Here, we describe the molecular bases for the <i>md</i>- and <i>mg</i>-dependent rescue of the <i>A<sup>y</sup></i> phenotype at the MC4R. We show that overexpression of ASP inhibits the rise in cAMP levels in response to α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, an MC4R agonist, by blocking ligand binding and by directing MC4R trafficking to the lysosome. Loss-of-function of either attractin or MGRN1 blocks ASP-dependent MC4R degradation and promotes increased trafficking of internalized MC4R to the cell surface, but it does not restore α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone-dependent cAMP signaling. We propose that MGRN1 and attractin are components of an evolutionarily conserved receptor trafficking pathway and that the <i>md</i> and <i>mg</i> mutations rescue the <i>A<sup>y</sup></i> phenotypes by a primarily cAMP-independent mechanism promoting trafficking of MC4R and likely MC1R away from the lysosome toward the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2038621827,"X-linked sideroblastic anemia with ataxia (XLSA/A) is a rare inherited disorder characterized by mild anemia and ataxia. XLSA/A is caused by mutations in the ABCB7 gene, which encodes a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter family. Studies in yeast, mammalian cells, and mice have shown that ABCB7 functions in the transport of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters into the cytoplasm. To further investigate the mechanism of this disease, we have identified and characterized the Caenorhabditis elegans homologue of the ABCB7 gene, abtm-1. We have studied the function of abtm-1 using mutants and RNAi. abtm-1-depleted animals produce arrested embryos that have morphogenetic defects and unusual premature, putative apoptotic events. abtm-1(RNAi) animals also show accumulation of ferric iron and increased oxidative stress. Despite the increased level of oxidative stress in abtm-1(RNAi) animals, they have an increased life span. We observed accumulation of DAF-16/FOXO in the nuclei of affected animals and elevation of the expression of SOD-3, a well established target of DAF-16, which may explain the increased life span extension of these animals. abtm-1 is strongly expressed in tissues with a high energy demand, and abtm-1(RNAi) animals have phenotypes that reflect the need for abtm-1 in these tissues. Finally, we show that reducing the function of other genes involved in Fe-S cluster production produces similar phenotypic consequences to abtm-1 loss of function.

X-linked sideroblastic anemia with ataxia (XLSA/A 2The abbreviations used are: XLSA/AX-linked sideroblastic anemia with ataxiaABCATP-binding cassettecatchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseMLmedian life span.; OMIM 301310) is a rare inherited disorder in which male patients suffer from mild anemia together with a nonprogressive and early onset ataxia characterized by dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesis (1Pagon R.A. Bird T.D. Detter J.C. Pierce I. J. Med. Genet. 1985; 22: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Other reported symptoms include dysarthria, intention tremor, mild learning disability, and depression. XLSA/A-associated anemia is mild and asymptomatic in males. Female carriers usually do not show anemia or neurological conditions. XLSA/A is caused by mutations in ABCB7, a gene located at position Xql3 (2Allikmets R. Raskind W.H. Hutchinson A. Schueck N.D. Dean M. Koeller D.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). ABCB7 encodes a highly conserved protein belonging to the ABCB family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters (3Savary S. Allikmets R. Denizot F. Luciani M.F. Mattei M.G. Dean M. Chimini G. Genomics. 1997; 41: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Members of the ABC superfamily are transmembrane proteins that use the hydrolysis of ATP to facilitate transport of a range of substrates across membranes. X-linked sideroblastic anemia with ataxia ATP-binding cassette chloramphenicol acetyltransferase median life span. Analyses of three different families with XLSA/A have identified three associated mutations in the ABCB7 gene. Two of these are missense mutations, which cause the substitution of residues within the ABCB7 transmembrane domains: V411L (4Maguire A. Hellier K. Hammans S. May A. Br. J. Haematol. 2001; 115: 910-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and I400M (2Allikmets R. Raskind W.H. Hutchinson A. Schueck N.D. Dean M. Koeller D.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The third mutation produces a more substantial amino acid change E433K (5Bekri S. Kispal G. Lange H. Fitzsimons E. Tolmie J. Lill R. Bishop D.F. Blood. 2000; 96: 3256-3264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A human cDNA containing the E433K change is able to partially rescue yeast carrying a mutation in ATM1, the homologue of ABCB7, suggesting that this change does not cause a complete loss of function (5Bekri S. Kispal G. Lange H. Fitzsimons E. Tolmie J. Lill R. Bishop D.F. Blood. 2000; 96: 3256-3264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, no complete loss of function mutations in this gene have been described, suggesting that ABCB7 is an essential molecule. In support of this suggestion, ABCB7 knock-out stem cells, hemizygous mice, and mice with conditional knock-outs in the central nervous system or bone marrow are all inviable (6Pondarré C. Antiochos B.B. Campagna D.R. Clarke S.L. Greer E.L. Deck K.M. McDonald A. Han A.P. Medlock A. Kutok J.L. Anderson S.A. Eisenstein R.S. Fleming M.D. Hum. Mol.

Studies in yeast have shown that Atm1p localizes to the mitochondrial inner membrane, and it has been suggested that this molecule is involved in the transport of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters from the lumen of mitochondria to the cytosol (8Kispal G. Csere P. Guiard B. Lill R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 346-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 9Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Moreover, work performed with conditional knock-out ABCB7 mice suggests that mammalian ABCB7 transporters are also involved in Fe-S cluster assembly (6Pondarré C. Antiochos B.B. Campagna D.R. Clarke S.L. Greer E.L. Deck K.M. McDonald A. Han A.P. Medlock A. Kutok J.L. Anderson S.A. Eisenstein R.S. Fleming M.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Thus, mammalian (10Cavadini P. Biasiotto G. Poli M. Levi S. Verardi R. Zanella I. Derosas M. Ingrassia R. Corrado M. Arosio P.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 346-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) ABCB7/ATM1-deficient cells show mitochondrial iron accumulation presumably because Fe-S clusters cannot be transferred to the cytosol. It is believed that this accumulation of mitochondrial iron causes oxidative stress, probably by the catalytic production of hydroxyl radicals, which then react with other biologically important molecules such as proteins, lipids, or DNA. This mitochondrial stress may then cause cellular dysfunction in the nervous system of patients. In addition, the impairment of iron homeostasis due to a lack of ABCB7 activity, directly or indirectly, disrupts the heme synthesis pathway, because Fe-S cluster assembly is essential for heme production (11Wingert R.A. Galloway J.L. Barut B. Foott H. Fraenkel P. Axe J.L. Weber G.J. Dooley K. Davidson A.J. Schmid B. Schmidt B. Paw B.H. Shaw G.C. Kingsley P. Palis J. Schubert H. Chen O. Kaplan J. Zon L.I. Nature. 2005; 436: 1035-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), and it is this change that is responsible for the anemia of XLSA/A patients (7Pondarre C. Campagna D.R. Antiochos B. Sikorski L. Mulhern H. Fleming M.D. Blood. 2007; 109: 3567-3569Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Therefore, XLSA/A is a mitochondrial disease caused by a mutation of a nuclear gene involved in Fe-S cluster biosynthesis. In this study, we used Caenorhabditis elegans to establish a model for the investigation of the molecular basis of XLSA/A. To do this, we have investigated the effect of depletion of abtm-1/ABCB7 using mutant worms and by RNAi. We report that reduction of abtm-1 function causes embryonic lethality during morphogenesis. We show that there is premature, putative apoptosis in abtm-1(RNAi) embryos that compromises the development of some cell lineages and may thus account for the increased embryonic lethality. abtm-1(RNAi) animals that reach adulthood show evidence of increased oxidative stress and accumulate ferric iron (Fe3+), which may produce free radicals. We have also found that abtm-1(RNAi) worms have a pattern of alterations in life span, defecation, motility, and other behaviors indicative of mitochondrial impairment. We show increased expression of SOD-3 (superoxide dismutase), a well known DAF-16/FOXO target, and nuclear localization of DAF-16/FOXO in abtm-1(RNAi) animals. These adaptations to stress may partially account for the observed life span extension. Analysis of the expression pattern of abtm-1 shows that the gene is strongly expressed in tissues that are likely to have a high demand for ATP. We also show that ablating other components of the Fe-S cluster synthesis pathway recapitulates some of the phenotypes observed in abtm-1-deficient animals. To identify the 5′ end of the cDNA, we used the sequence of the spliced leader, SL1, as a forward primer, and a gene-specific oligonucleotide as the reverse primer. The 3′ end was determined using rapid amplification of 3′-complementary DNA ends. Both products were cloned into pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced. We used primers designed using the information obtained from these clones to amplify the full-length cDNA. All products were cloned and sequenced to obtain the whole structure of abtm-1. The coding sequence of the gene does not differ significantly from the predicted spliced gene in the WormBase (release WS181) (NCBI accession number AF490975) (supplemental Fig. S1A). Worms were cultured using standard techniques and media (12Lewis J.A. Fleming J.T. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Strains used in this work are listed in supplemental Table S2. We out-crossed abtm-1(tm2721), a gift from S. Mitani, four times before any phenotypic analysis was performed. After outcrossing, abtm-1(tm2721) males were crossed to KR344, which carries the free duplication sDp2. F2 hermaphrodites carrying sDp2 and tm2721 in homozygosis were isolated. All strains were maintained at 20 °C, unless otherwise stated. We used a PCR-based fusion approach to make abtm-1::GFP constructs. Both constructs also contain the 3′-UTR from unc-54. To produce the mitochondrial construct, abtm-1::GFP1, we fused a region containing the putative promoter and the first three exons of the abtm-1 gene to GFP (Fig. 1A). The primers used were as follows: forward primer FP1175, 5′ CTC ACG ATT GAA ACG GAC CCG, and reverse primer FP784, 5′ AGT CGA CCT GCA GGC ATG CAA GCT TAC TTG ACT ACT GGC TCC CGG. The peptide produced by this construct contains the putative mitochondrial signal peptide. To obtain the cytoplasmic construct, abtm-1::GFP2 (Fig. 1A), we amplified the region contained between the upstream gene, eif-3, and the first codon of abtm-1 (forward primer FP1178, 5′ CCT ATT TTT GAA GGT TTC TGC G; reverse primer FP814, 5′ AGT CGA CCT GCA GGC ATG CAA GCT CAT TAT CGA TCT CTG AAA ACT GGA TTC GG). Both reverse primers used to make the constructs contain a sequence that overlaps the GFP sequence to allow fusion by PCR. To obtain transgenic animals, we injected 1–2 ng/μl of the test DNA together with 60 ng/μl of pRF4 as a marker, and 60 ng/μl of genomic DNA from wild type worms, digested with XhoI, as a DNA carrier, using methods described before (13Mello C. Fire A. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 451-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). Hermaphrodites carrying extrachromosomal arrays containing abtm-1::GFP1 were incubated at 25 °C for an hour in 50 μm MitoTracker® Red CMXRos (Invitrogen) and 1.8 mm 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), diluted in M9 buffer (12Lewis J.A. Fleming J.T. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). These animals were allowed to recover on fresh NGM plates for an hour at 20 °C. Then worms were anesthetized using 20 mm sodium azide in M9 buffer and mounted for microscopy on 2% agarose pads. Images were acquired using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). RNAi was carried out by injection of dsRNA. dsRNA was synthesized in vitro, using template fragments between 400 and 700 bp, from the appropriate ORF, amplified by PCR using primers described in supplemental Table S3, and cloned into pGEM-T (Promega). dsRNA was made using T7 and SP6 RNA polymerases (Invitrogen) and combining the two single-stranded molecules, as described before (14Miguel-Aliaga I. Culetto E. Walker D.S. Baylis H.A. Sattelle D.B. Davies K.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). As a control, we used dsRNA from the Escherichia coli chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene. Several young adult hermaphrodites were injected in the gonads (13Mello C. Fire A. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 451-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). Injected worms were transferred after 18 h and phenotypes analyzed in the post-18-h offspring. Phenotypes were scored as described below. To investigate embryonic lethality in RNAi experiments, we collected embryos from animals after 24 and 38 h following the injection of dsRNA. Then we removed the parents and allowed the embryos to develop fully for 24 h before counting the number of arrested embryos and larvae. To investigate lethality from mutant strains, we did the same, but for the entire fertile period of the adults. We used 10–12 parental animals per strain per experiment. We considered embryos as arrested when they failed to hatch within 24 h. We considered larvae as arrested when they did not progress to adulthood within 48 h of hatching. To further analyze embryonic development, embryos were isolated by dissection and then mounted in embryo culture medium (15Zwaal R.R. Ahringer J. van Luenen H.G. Rushforth A. Anderson P.

Confocal microscopy was performed using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope. Embryos for four-dimensional microscopy analysis were prepared as described (16Schnabel R. Hutter H. Moerman D. Schnabel H. Dev. Biol. 1997; 184: 234-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Eight abtm-1(RNAi) and three wild type embryos were mounted, at a very early stage (usually the two-cell stage), and recording of their development was carried out at 25 °C for 10 h at intervals of 60 s, with 25 different focal planes (1 μm separation), using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope (Carl Zeiss STM GmbH, Germany) equipped with Nomarski optics adapted as described (16Schnabel R. Hutter H. Moerman D. Schnabel H. Dev. Biol. 1997; 184: 234-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Cell lineage of the recorded embryos was subsequently traced using SIMI Biocell (SIMI GmbH, Germany). Worms were collected from plates by washing with M9 buffer and transferred to screw cap tubes. The tubes were shaken gently for 20 min at room temperature to allow digestion of bacteria. Worms were collected by sedimentation and washed three times with M9 buffer. Five volumes of ice-cold lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture) were added to the worm pellets, and the mixture was homogenized using glass homogenizer during a 30-min period to allow cuticle breakdown. Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was collected for use in further analysis. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method. To determine the iron content of the worms, we used a BioVision iron assay kit (BioVision, Mountain View, CA). Protein samples from ∼3000 atm-1(RNAi), or cat(RNAi), or frh-1(ok610), or N2 worms were tested for ferrous (Fe2+), ferric (Fe3+), and total (Fe2+ + Fe3+) iron following the manufacturer's instructions. To measure sensitivity to oxidative stress, 80 abtm-1(RNAi) or cat(RNAi) L4 larvae were incubated in the presence of 0, 0.5, 5, and 10 mm paraquat (methyl viologen, Sigma). The experiments were carried out for 3 days at 25 °C, as described previously (17Vázquez-Manrique R.P. González-Cabo P. Ros S. Aziz H. Baylis H.A. Palau F. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 172-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We scored worm survival each day, using the same protocol as for life span assays. To analyze protein carbonylation we used an OxyblotTM protein oxidation detection kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Briefly, worm lysate, prepared as above, containing 15 μg of protein was incubated in 12% SDS supplemented with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine for 10 min at room temperature. Samples were resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE, and 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine-derivatized proteins were detected by immunoblot using an anti-2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine antibody. In vivo analysis of sod-3 and daf-16 reporters-sod-3 expression was analyzed using the KN259 (huIs33[sod-3p::sod-3::GFP+pRF4(rol-6(su1006)]) reporter strain. To quantify sod-3::GFP expression, we collected fluorescence images of more than 30 animals for each condition (abtm-1(RNAi) or cat(RNAi)). We then measured the pixels produced by fluorescence in the whole body of animals and determined the fluorescence level relative to worm area, using ImageJ. To investigate the cellular localization of DAF-16, we used the strain TJ365 (zIs356[daf-16p::daf-16::GFP; rol-6(su1006)]). We analyzed control and abtm-1(RNAi) young adults produced by independently injected hermaphrodites (number of observed animals per strain ≥300). We observed the worms under a dissecting microscope, equipped with fluorescence. Animals were kept on plates with food, at 20 °C, and positives were scored when the animals presented fluorescent nuclei in one or more tissues. As a positive control we used animals under starving conditions. To measure life span, L4 larvae were cultured at 20 °C on NGM with 0.1 g/ml of 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (Sigma) until death. Death was assessed by the response of the animal to gentle nose touch. Worm survival was counted every 24 h. Missing worms were scored as censored data. We scored more than 200 worms per sample. All data are presented as means ± S.E. or as % of population. To assess statistical significance, we compared different populations using Student's two-tailed t test using GraphPad on line. To compare survival curves from life span and oxidative stress assays, we used the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test, contained within the GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). To identify homologues of ABCB7 in C. elegans, we used the human ABCB7 (hABCB7) sequence to search the C. elegans genome. We found that abtm-1 (Y74C10AR.3) (Fig. 1A) shows high similarity to hABCB7. We cloned the abtm-1 cDNA using RT-PCR. The abtm-1 cDNA is 2504 bp long (supplemental Fig. S1A) and encodes a predicted protein of 703 residues. The C-terminal region of the predicted peptide, ABTM-1, is 51% identical to hABCB7 (supplemental Fig. S1B). ABTM-1 has the typical ABC superfamily structure, with six transmembrane domains and an ATP binding domain (supplemental Fig. S1B). Alignment of the protein sequence with sequences from the human and yeast ABCB7 family shows that ABTM-1 clusters within this family (supplemental Fig. S1C), strongly suggesting that this protein belongs to the ABCB7 transporter group. Analysis of ABTM-1 using the Mitoprot program (18Claros M.G. Vincens P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar) gave a probability of 99.4% that ABTM-1 is mitochondrial. To demonstrate that ABTM-1 is indeed a mitochondrial protein, we produced transgenic animals carrying an abtm-1::GFP fusion (abtm-1::GFP1, Fig. 1A) in which GFP is fused to the end of the third exon of abtm-1. The predicted peptide should contain the first 67 amino acids of the protein, including the predicted mitochondrial localization signal. We incubated transgenic worms carrying abtm-1::GFP1 with a mitochondrial marker, MitoTracker® Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes). Confocal microscopy of these worms shows that ABTM-1::GFP1 clearly co-localizes with the mitochondrial marker (Fig. 1B) confirming that ABTM-1 is a mitochondrial protein and the C. elegans homologue of hABCB7. We sought to investigate the expression pattern of abmt-1 using the abtm-1::GFP1 fusion; however, this construct resulted in some toxicity (data not shown). We therefore produced a cytoplasmic GFP construct, abtm-1::GFP2, in which the first codon of abtm-1 was fused to GFP (Fig. 1A). Transgenic animals containing abtm-1::GFP2 show widespread expression in the tissues of adult hermaphrodites, including the intestine, spermatheca, epidermis, and coelomocytes, among others (data not shown). Interestingly, abtm-1::GFP2 is highly expressed in tissues that are predicted to require high levels of energy production such as pharyngeal muscles (Fig. 1C, panel i), neurons (Fig. 1C, panel i), developing embryos (Fig. 1C, panel ii), and body wall muscles (Fig. 1C, panel iii), among others. We obtained a strain carrying a deletion and, probably, null allele of abtm-1, abtm-1(tm2721) (Fig. 1A). The tm2721 allele was out-crossed and balanced with sDp2, a duplication of the region of chromosome I carrying the abtm-1 gene thus, allowing us to maintain tm2721. sDp2 is a free duplication that undergoes random, non-Mendelian segregation with either copy of chromosome I during meiosis (19Rose A.M. Baillie D.L. Curran J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 195: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Hermaphrodites carrying mutations that map in the region balanced with sDp2 segregate, about 38% unbalanced mutant homozygotes (19Rose A.M. Baillie D.L. Curran J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 195: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We isolated and analyzed three abtm-1(tm2721)I; sDp2(I;f) strains from independent crosses. We were unable to isolate viable homozygous unbalanced animals from these strains. We observed that the balanced animals produced 28.1 ± 1.1% arrested embryos and 7.1 ± 0.6% arrested L1-L2 larvae (wild type 1.2 ± 0.2% and 0% arrested embryos and larvae). The total lethality is therefore 35.2%, which is close to the predicted value of 38% for homozygous animals. This experiment strongly suggests that abmt-1(tm2721) homozygous animals exhibit early lethality and are unable to develop to adulthood. Because complete ablation of abtm-1 is lethal, we sought to emulate the condition of XLSA/A patients by reducing, rather than completely removing, the function of the abtm-1 gene. To do this we used RNAi (abtm-1(RNAi)). We injected double-stranded abtm-1 RNA into young wild type hermaphrodites to induce RNAi and then examined the resulting offspring. In agreement with results obtained using abmt-1(tm2721) embryos, we observed that reducing ABTM-1 in wild type hermaphrodites induces embryonic arrest in their offspring, 28 ± 1.24% (Fig. 2A). This lethality is further increased to 56 ± 2.7% in daf-16/FOXO mutants (Fig. 2A). DAF-16 is widely involved in insulin signaling and stress responses in C. elegans (20Baumeister R. Schaffitzel E. Hertweck M. J. Endocrinol. 2006; 190: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Thus daf-16 can protect against abtm-1(RNAi)-induced lethality, suggesting that the lethality may result from increased stress of some kind. To further analyze the nature of the defects in abtm-1(RNAi), we observed them under a differential interference contrast microscope. Some abtm-1(RNAi) embryos, 7.7%, arrested during the early proliferative stages (Fig. 2B); however, most of the arrested embryos showed clear signs of cell differentiation (Fig. 2C). For example, abtm-1(RNAi) embryos had gut granules indicating that the intestinal cells had differentiated (Fig. 2C, panel ii) and also showed vigorous twitching, an indicator of muscle cell differentiation. As the embryos arrested after gastrulation, we analyzed the behavior of epidermis, which plays a major role during embryonic morphogenesis (21Chisholm A.D. Hardin J. Priess J.R. Seydoux G. WormBook. 2005: 1-2210.1895/wormbook.1.35.1Google Scholar, 22Köppen M. Simske J.S. Sims P.A. Firestein B.L. Hall D.H. Radice A.D. Rongo C. Hardin J.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). To do this we used an epithelial cell-specific marker, ajm-1::GFP (22Köppen M. Simske J.S. Sims P.A. Firestein B.L. Hall D.H. Radice A.D. Rongo C. Hardin J.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). 92.3% of arrested abtm-1(RNAi) embryos showed correctly (i.e. apically) localized AJM-1::GFP (n = 104) (Fig. 2C, panels ii–iv), suggesting that the epidermal cells are also differentiated. Nevertheless, analysis of the pattern of AJM-1::GFP revealed that most embryos show a highly disorganized structure, including a retracted epidermis (Fig. 2C, panels ii and iii), and the presence of internal tissues on the exterior of the embryo (Fig. 2C, panel ii). Therefore, ABTM-1 is required for appropriate embryonic morphogenesis in C. elegans. To investigate possible causes of the morphogenetic defects in abtm-1(RNAi) embryos, we used four-dimensional video microscopy and lineage analysis. The cell lineage of C. elegans is well defined so that every somatic cell can be traced (16Schnabel R. Hutter H. Moerman D. Schnabel H. Dev. Biol. 1997; 184: 234-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 57Sulston J.E. Schierenberg E. White J.G. Thomson J.N. Dev. Biol. 1983; 100: 64-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2823) Google Scholar). Moreover, four-dimensional imaging is a well established tool for identifying and studying apoptosis (23Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1986; 44: 817-829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar, 24Kinchen J.M. Cabello J. Klingele D. Wong K. Feichtinger R. Schnabel H. Schnabel R. Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2005; 434: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In a wild type embryo the progeny of the “founder cell” AB (the anterior cell in the two-cell stage embryo) divide, in near synchrony, after each cell generation and can be readily tracked by four-dimensional video microscopy imaging. We recorded abtm-1(RNAi) and wild type embryos to identify differences in cell cycle length, fate specification, morphogenesis, and cell death. Six of the abtm-1(RNAi) embryos were analyzed in detail with respect to cell lineage and timing. We observed four phenotypic classes of abtm-1(RNAi) embryos (Table 1). abtm-1(RNAi) embryos have delayed cell divisions, cells that are excluded from the embryo and in extreme cases burst. In addition, two of the embryos showed a striking defect. Some cells in the 9th cell generation (ABalaaapp, ABprappap, and ABprppapa in one embryo, and most probably ABplpppapp in the other) underwent cell death, most probably by apoptosis (Fig. 2D). In normal embryos apoptosis occurs in specific cells in the 10th and the 11th cell generation, as a consequence of specific cell fate decisions. The presence of these putative premature apoptotic events may indicate that cells are activating the apoptotic pathway as consequence of cellular stress. abtm-1(RNAi) embryos also show increases in the cell cycle length (Table 1). The severity of this defect increases as development proceeds with late cells dividing much more slowly than the early blastomeres. On average the division of ABxxxxxx, the last cell division recorded, was nearly twice as long as the wild type division, and in extreme cases was nearly three times as long (Table 1). Again, this suggests that cellular metabolism is disrupted. In addition, in three embryos some cells were excluded from the body during morphogenesis (Fig. 2D, panel ii). Four-dimensional analysis, in one embryo, clearly identified 3 of 10 of these cells as neuronal cells of the ring ganglion (the specific cells are ABalapappap, ABalappaapa, and ABalapppaap).TABLE 1Delayed cell divisions in abtm-1(RNAi) embryosCycle cellTime for cell division (mins) (% of increment in cell cycle)aThe increment of the time in delayed cycles is shown in parentheses.

https://openalex.org/W1999149884,"The role of the AP-1 transcription factor Fra-1 (encoded by Fosl1) in inflammatory responses associated with lung disease is largely unknown. Here, we show that Fra-1 overexpression in mice reduced proinflammatory cytokine production in response to injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a Toll-like receptor (TLR)-ligand. Unexpectedly, Fra-1 transgenic mice died rapidly following LPS treatment, showing severe interstitial lung disease and displaying massive accumulation of macrophages and overproduction of several chemokines, including macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1, encoded by Ccl2). To assess the clinical relevance of Fra-1 in lung pathology, mice were treated with the anticancer drug gefitinib (Iressa), which can lead to interstitial lung disease in patients. Gefitinib-treated mice showed increased Fosl1 and Ccl2 expression and developed interstitial lung disease in response to LPS, endogenous TLR ligands and chemotherapy. Moreover, deletion of Fra-1 or blocking MCP-1 receptor signaling in mice attenuated gefitinib-enhanced lethality in response to LPS. Importantly, human alveolar macrophages showed enhanced LPS-induced FOSL1 and CCL2 expression after gefitinib treatment. These results indicate that Fra-1 is an important mediator of interstitial lung disease following gefitinib treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2012835090,"Glycogen synthase, a central enzyme in glucose metabolism, catalyzes the successive addition of α-1,4-linked glucose residues to the non-reducing end of a growing glycogen molecule. A non-catalytic glycogen-binding site, identified by x-ray crystallography on the surface of the glycogen synthase from the archaeon Pyrococcus abyssi, has been found to be functionally conserved in the eukaryotic enzymes. The disruption of this binding site in both the archaeal and the human muscle glycogen synthases has a large impact when glycogen is the acceptor substrate. Instead, the catalytic efficiency remains essentially unchanged when small oligosaccharides are used as substrates. Mutants of the human muscle enzyme with reduced affinity for glycogen also show an altered intracellular distribution and a marked decrease in their capacity to drive glycogen accumulation in vivo. The presence of a high affinity glycogen-binding site away from the active center explains not only the long-recognized strong binding of glycogen synthase to glycogen but also the processivity and the intracellular localization of the enzyme. These observations demonstrate that the glycogen-binding site is a critical regulatory element responsible for the in vivo catalytic efficiency of GS."

These proteins have been used commercially for many years for the control of insect pests in agriculture and human-disease vectors, because they are highly specific to insects, innocuous to vertebrates and plants, and biodegradable (1de Maagd R.A.

Protoxins are solubilized in the larval gut lumen and activated by midgut proteases in both terminal ends to yield activated monomeric 60-kDa toxins with a three domain structure (1de Maagd R.A.

Domain I is a seven α-helix bundle implicated in oligomerization and in membrane channel formation. Domain II consists of a beta-prism of three anti-parallel β-sheets packed around a hydrophobic core and domain III is a β-sandwich of two antiparallel β-sheets. Domains II and III are important for interaction with toxin receptors and thus have important roles in insect specificity (1de Maagd R.A. Bravo A. Berry C. Crickmore N. Schnepf H.E. Annu. Rev.

The activated monomeric toxins bind to highly abundant low affinity receptors, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, such as aminopeptidase N (APN) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), localizing the toxin in the brush border microvilli.

After this, the toxin binds to low abundant cadherin receptor, in a high affinity and complex interaction involving participation of loop 2, loop 3, and loop α-8 of domain II the toxin.

It was shown that the hydrophilic face of helix α-4 is facing the lumen of the pore, by in situ restoration of a negative charge of mutant D136C, that resulted in restitution of ionic conductance to the levels of the wild-type Cry1Aa toxin (16Vachon V. Préfontaine G. Rang C. Coux F. Juteau M. Schwartz J.L. Brousseau R. Frutos R. Laprade R. Masson L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 6123-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).In 2001, an alternative model was proposed based in data of the activation energy of denaturation of Cry3Aa toxin when it is bound to the membrane (20Loseva O.I. Tiktopulo E.I. Vasiliev V.D. Nikulin A.D. Dobritsa A.P. Potekhin S.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14143-14151Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this model the authors proposed that the conformation of the toxin do not change upon insertion into the membrane and that the three domains of Cry3Aa inserted into the bilayer without further conformational changes, with the exception of the first three α-helices (20Loseva O.I. Tiktopulo E.I. Vasiliev V.D. Nikulin A.D. Dobritsa A.P. Potekhin S.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14143-14151Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In 2008, a study that involved the analysis of several single cysteine (Cys) Cry1A mutants labeled with fluorescent dyes, such as 1,5-IAEDANS, or acrylodan, also concluded that all domains of the toxin insert into the membrane (21Nair M.S. Dean D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26324-26331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These data contradicted previous studies that had shown that some regions of domains II and III of Cry1A toxins remain in the surface of the membrane (9Pardo-López L. Gómez I. Rausell C. Sanchez J.

Quenching analysis of tryptophan (Trp) florescence of the membrane-inserted Cry1Ac oligomer, showed that Trp-545, located in domain III, remains exposed to the solvent (9Pardo-López L. Gómez I. Rausell C. Sanchez J. Soberón M. Bravo A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 10329-10336Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis of Trp residues to 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid dye (ANS) in membrane-bound Cry1Ab oligomer, indicated that domains II and III were located in the surface of the membrane, in contrast to domain I that was inserted into the membrane (22Rausell C.

It is important to mention that most of the pore forming toxins, such as anthrax toxin, aerolysin, α-hemolysin, and CDC toxins, that kill different cell types, behave in a similar way, since only a small part of these proteins inserts into the lipid bilayer, while the rest of the protein remains outside of the membrane (23Parker M.W. Feil S.C. Progress Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2005; 88: 91-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Recently, a three-dimensional structure model of the Cry4Aa pre-pore, and the pore oligomer was presented (24Taveecharoenkool T. Angsuthanasombat Ch. Kantchanawarin Ch. PMC. Biophysics. 2010; 3: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this model the authors suggested that domains II and III of Cry4Aa toxin remain in the surface in the membrane bound oligomer and only the hairpin formed by helices α-4 and α-5 of domain I is involved in the insertion into the lipid bilayer (24Taveecharoenkool T. Angsuthanasombat Ch. Kantchanawarin Ch. PMC. Biophysics. 2010; 3: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).The aim of this work was to understand how Cry toxins insert into the membrane. We isolated several mutants with single Cys residues in the three domains of Cry1Ab toxin and analyzed their insertion into the membrane using fluorescence spectroscopy and quenching analysis with different soluble quenchers as well as a membrane-bound quencher to compare the properties of the soluble and membrane-inserted forms of Cry1Ab toxin. Three mutants are located in domain I, two in domain II, and two in domain III. Among the mutants located in domain I, one mutant (V171C) is located in helix α-5, that corresponds to the region involved in membrane insertion according to Taveecharoenkool et al. (24Taveecharoenkool T. Angsuthanasombat Ch. Kantchanawarin Ch. PMC. Biophysics. 2010; 3: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that domains II and III of the toxin remained exposed to the solvent in the surface of the membrane and only a discrete region of domain I was inserted into the lipid bilayer.DISCUSSIONCry1Ab protoxins must go through several structural changes before reaching their functional pore-forming state. These steps include solubilization of the crystal and processing of the protoxin by midgut proteases; binding of monomer to toxin receptors; oligomer formation and insertion into the membrane, to form the membrane active pore. Different Cry toxins, active against different insect orders, also form oligomeric structures after interaction with their protein receptors (9Pardo-López L. Gómez I. Rausell C. Sanchez J. Soberón M.

Biol. 2006; 212: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The Cry oligomer is a highly stable structure since it is resistant to SDS treatment and boiling suggesting a strong interaction between monomers (39Rausell C. Muñoz-Garay C. Miranda-CassoLuengo R. Gómez I. Rudiño-Piñera E. Soberón M. Bravo A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It was previously shown that the Cry1A oligomeric structure is a functional structure that is able to interact with the membrane lipid bilayer, forming stable pores, in contrast to the monomer that has marginal interaction with the liposomes (39Rausell C. Muñoz-Garay C. Miranda-CassoLuengo R. Gómez I. Rudiño-Piñera E. Soberón M. Bravo A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In this work, we showed that binding of monomeric Cry1Ab mutant toxins to BBMV resulted in the formation of a 250 kDa structure, that remained associated with BBMV (supplemental Fig. S1), supporting that oligomer formation is important for membrane insertion of Cry1Ab toxin.In the case of other pore-forming toxins (PFT) produced by other bacteria, an oligomeric pre-pore structure is also produced after receptor binding and the oligomeric structures of these toxins represents a toxin intermediate before insertion into the membrane (23Parker M.W. Feil S.C. Progress Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2005; 88: 91-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Regarding membrane insertion of these PFT, it has been documented that insertion into the membrane involves only small regions of these proteins (23Parker M.W. Feil S.C. Progress Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2005; 88: 91-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). There are several examples of PFT that span the membrane bilayer by forming β-barrel structure, named β-PFT. Other PFT insert clusters of α-helices, and are named α-PFT. In most of the β-PFT, the insertion into the membrane, involves a subtle conformational change, where only a small part of the protein is located in the lipid environment, while the rest of the protein remain outside of the membrane (23Parker M.W. Feil S.C. Progress Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2005; 88: 91-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In several β-PFT, the structural region that inserts into the membrane, represents a small-unstructured loop motive in the soluble protein that refolds to form a transmembrane β-strand, that will be part of the β-barrel pore (23Parker M.W. Feil S.C. Progress Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2005; 88: 91-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In other cases such as the CDC toxin-family, important conformational changes from α-helix to β-strand, have been documented (23Parker M.W. Feil S.C. Progress Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2005; 88: 91-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 36Ramachandran R. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In contrast, α-PFTs, like colicins, have a dynamic structure that involved the insertion of preformed α-helices into the membrane (23Parker M.W. Feil S.C. Progress Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2005; 88: 91-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Also, in the case of α-PFT cytolysin A from Staphylococcus aureus, a conformational change must undergo to form the transmembrane pore, which is composed of 12 monomers, where only amphipathic α-helix A1 and part α-helix F1 penetrate the lipid bilayer (40Mueller M. Grauschopf U. Maier T. Glockshuber R. Ban N. Nature. 2009; 459: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar).Nair and Dean (21Nair M.S. Dean D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26324-26331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) reported that all domains of Cry1A toxin insert into the membrane, based in fluorescent studies of single Cys mutants labeled with 1,5-IAEDANS and acrylodan (21Nair M.S. Dean D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26324-26331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, their conclusions reached by the analysis of fluorescent changes of Cry1Ab mutants labeled with 1,5-IAEDANS were incorrect, because 1,5-IAEDANS is highly sensitive to polar environment, showing much higher fluorescence in hydrophobic environments, and this dye is not quenched by KI (Fig. 2) (31Hudson E.N. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4154-4161Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 32Spruijt R.B. Wolfs C.J. Verver J.W. Hemminga M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10383-10391Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The misinterpretations of their data drove these authors to incorrect conclusions. In fact, the analysis of the data of Nair and Dean (21Nair M.S. Dean D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26324-26331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), in view of our observations on the quenching of 1,5-IAEDANS upon exposure to the solvent (Fig. 2), indicates that most of domain II and domain III residues analyzed by them, remained exposed to the solvent, since most of the Cys mutants analyzed by them showed reduced fluorescence intensities when inserted into the membrane, indicating higher exposure to the solvent (21Nair M.S. Dean D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26324-26331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition, we show that 1,5-IAEDANS fluorescence is not susceptible to be quenched by KI, indicating that their KI quenching analysis of 1,5-IAEDANS-labeled mutants were not conclusive.The most reliable way to determine changes on the exposition to the solvent, of a particular residue labeled with a fluorescent probe, is the use of soluble hydrophilic collisional quenchers (30Lakowicz J. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar). In this work, we incubated Cry1Ab toxin with BBMV at pH 9 since we have previously reported that alkaline pH enhanced Cry1Ab membrane insertion and pore formation, by facilitating a molten globe intermediate which is consistent with the alkaline pH found in lepidopteran midgut lumen (26Muñóz-Garay C. Portugal L. Pardo-López L. Jiménez-Juárez N. Arenas I. Gómez I. Sánchez-López R. Arroyo R. Holzenburg A. Savva C.G. Soberón M. Bravo A. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that interaction of all Cys mutant proteins of Cry1Ab with BBMV resulted in the formation of the 250 kDa oligomeric structure (supplemental Fig. S1).Our data indicate that only a small region of domain I is involved in membrane insertion and that domain II and III remain in the surface during pore formation. We report here that residue Gly-183, located in the loop between α5 and α6 of domain I, remains exposed to the solvent upon membrane insertion. These data indicated that not all domain I inserts into the membrane, supporting the umbrella insertion model, which proposed that only the hairpin conformed by helices α-4 and α-5 is inserted into the lipid bilayer (10Schwartz J.L.

Acta. 2009; 1788: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Other reports have also supported the umbrella model of toxin insertion. Residue Trp-545 of Cry1Ac toxin, that is located in domain III, remained exposed into the solvent after membrane insertion as shown by the analysis of W545A mutant (9Pardo-López L. Gómez I. Rausell C. Sanchez J. Soberón M. Bravo A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 10329-10336Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). FRET analysis between tryptophan residues of domain I and ANS, showed that domain I moves apart from domain II and III upon membrane insertion (22Rausell C. Pardo-López L. Sánchez J. Muñoz-Garay C. Morera C. Soberón M. Bravo A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55168-55175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Finally, pore formation activity of biotin labeled single Cys Cry1Aa mutants, showed that binding of streptavidin protein to biotin-labeled residues located in the loop between helices α-4 and α-5, affected pore formation activity, confirming that this hairpin is important for pore formation (19Girard F. Vachon V. Lebel G. Préfontaine G. Schwartz J.L. Masson L. Laprade R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1788: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar).Our analysis indicated that three residues, two in domain I(Val-171 and Thr-122) and one in domain II (Ser-364) were less exposed to the solvent upon toxin membrane insertion. To further analyze if the change in solvent exposure of these residues was due to membrane insertion, quenching by 5-doxyl-PC lipid incorporated to BBMV was analyzed. The 5-doxyl-PC phospholipid used as quencher of fluorescence is a good ruler for probing membrane insertion of peptides labeled with 1,5-IAEDANS, because it acts over a short distance, without drastically perturbing the membrane. Experiments with 5-doxyl-PC-labeled phospholipids further demonstrated that Val-171 and Thr-122 residues interact with the lipid bilayer in contrast to Ser-364 residue that was not quenched in BBMV containing this quencher lipid suggesting that it remains in the surface, out side of the lipid core. Furthermore, we show here that interaction with cadherin and ALP receptors that are present in the BBMV affected the interaction of S364C with the KI collisional quencher indicating that this residue is less exposed to the solvent upon membrane insertion due to protein-protein interaction with BBMV receptor molecules.Our results support the umbrella model of toxin insertion and are in agreement with a recently three-dimensional structure model of the Cry4Aa pre-pore oligomer that shows that the loop formed by helices α-4 and α-5 of domain I is the region that inserts into the lipid bilayer (24Taveecharoenkool T. Angsuthanasombat Ch. Kantchanawarin Ch. PMC. Biophysics. 2010; 3: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We agree that the precise structure of the toxin in its membrane-inserted state still remains to be solved; nevertheless, it is clear that only discrete regions of domain I insert into the membrane and that domains II and III remain exposed to the solvent.

Its role in the development of the CNS, however, is largely unknown. Mice lacking Smad2 in the CNS (Smad2-CNS-KO) were generated by a Cre-loxP approach. These mice exhibited behavioral abnormalities in motor coordination from an early postnatal stage and mortality at approximately 3 weeks of age, suggestive of severe cerebellar dysfunction. Gross observation of Smad2-CNS-KO cerebella demonstrated aberrant foliations in lobule IX and X. Further analyses revealed increased apoptotic cell death, delayed migration and maturation of granule cells, and retardation of dendritic arborization of Purkinje cells. These findings indicate that Smad2 plays a key role in cerebellar development and motor function control."
https://openalex.org/W2058027471,"The G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK2) belongs to a family of protein kinases that phosphorylates agonist-activated G protein-coupled receptors, leading to G protein-receptor uncoupling and termination of G protein signaling. GRK2 also contains a regulator of G protein signaling homology (RH) domain, which selectively interacts with α-subunits of the Gq/11 family that are released during G protein-coupled receptor activation. We have previously reported that kinase activity of GRK2 up-regulates activity of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in a Na(+) absorptive epithelium by blocking Nedd4-2-dependent inhibition of ENaC. In the present study, we report that GRK2 also regulates ENaC by a mechanism that does not depend on its kinase activity. We show that a wild-type GRK2 (wtGRK2) and a kinase-dead GRK2 mutant ((K220R)GRK2), but not a GRK2 mutant that lacks the C-terminal RH domain (ΔRH-GRK2) or a GRK2 mutant that cannot interact with Gαq/11/14 ((D110A)GRK2), increase activity of ENaC. GRK2 up-regulates the basal activity of the channel as a consequence of its RH domain binding the α-subunits of Gq/11. We further found that expression of constitutively active Gαq/11 mutants significantly inhibits activity of ENaC. Conversely, co-expression of siRNA against Gαq/11 increases ENaC activity. The effect of Gαq on ENaC activity is not due to change in ENaC membrane expression and is independent of Nedd4-2. These findings reveal a novel mechanism by which GRK2 and Gq/11 α-subunits regulate the activity ENaC."

https://openalex.org/W2034463297,"Background Gammaretroviruses and gammaretroviral vectors, in contrast to lentiviruses and lentiviral vectors, are reported to be restricted in their ability to infect growth-arrested cells. The block to this restriction has never been clearly defined. The original assessment of the inability of gammaretroviruses and gammaretroviral vectors to infect growth-arrested cells was carried out using established cell lines that had been growth-arrested by chemical means, and has been generalized to neurons, which are post-mitotic. We re-examined the capability of gammaretroviruses and their derived vectors to efficiently infect terminally differentiated neuroendocrine cells and primary cortical neurons, a target of both experimental and therapeutic interest. Methodology/Principal Findings Using GFP expression as a marker for infection, we determined that both growth-arrested (NGF-differentiated) rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12 cells) and primary rat cortical neurons could be efficiently transduced, and maintained long-term protein expression, after exposure to murine leukemia virus (MLV) and MLV-based retroviral vectors. Terminally differentiated PC12 cells transduced with a gammaretroviral vector encoding the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL were protected from cell death induced by withdrawal of nerve growth factor (NGF), demonstrating gammaretroviral vector-mediated delivery and expression of genes at levels sufficient for therapeutic effect in non-dividing cells. Post-mitotic rat cortical neurons were also shown to be susceptible to transduction by murine replication-competent gammaretroviruses and gammaretroviral vectors. Conclusions/Significance These findings suggest that the host range of gammaretroviruses includes post-mitotic and other growth-arrested cells in mammals, and have implications for re-direction of gammaretroviral gene therapy to neurological disease."
https://openalex.org/W2036960438,"The 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) undergoes constitutive and agonist-dependent internalization. Despite many advances in our understanding of G protein-coupled receptor trafficking, the exact mechanism of endocytic sorting of G protein-coupled receptors remains obscure. Recently, we have reported a novel finding documenting a global role for the ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl in regulating vesicular sorting of epidermal growth factor receptor (Baldys, A., Göoz, M., Morinelli, T. A., Lee, M. H., Raymond, J. R., Jr., Luttrell, L. M., and Raymond, J. R., Sr. (2009) Biochemistry 48, 1462–1473). Thus, we tested the hypothesis that c-Cbl might play a role in 5-HT2AR recycling. In this study, we demonstrated an association of 5-HT2AR with c-Cbl. Furthermore, down-regulation of c-Cbl by RNA interference blocked efficient recycling of 5-HT2AR to the plasma membrane. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that 5-HT2A receptors were trapped in early endosome antigen 1- and Rab11-positive sorting endosomes in cells overexpressing c-Cbl mutants lacking carboxyl termini. This inhibitory effect was associated with a relative decrease in association of c-Cbl truncation proteins with the 5-HT2AR, compared with that observed for the full-length c-Cbl fusion protein. Consistent with the delayed recycling, 5-HT2AR resensitization was greatly attenuated in the presence of c-Cbl mutants lacking carboxyl termini, as detected by changes in the cytosolic calcium. Taken together, these studies have led to the discovery that the C-terminal region of c-Cbl plays a crucial role in the temporal and spatial control of 5-HT2AR recycling.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) 2The abbreviations used are: GPCRsG protein-coupled receptors5-HT2AR5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptorEEA1early endosome antigen 1EGFRepidermal growth factor receptorLAMPlysosome-associated membrane proteinM6PRmannose 6-phosphate receptor5-HTserotoninNTnot transfectedSCRscrambled. belong to the largest superfamily of plasma membrane proteins, accounting for >1% of the human genome (2Drake M.T. Shenoy S.K. Lefkowitz R.J. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 570-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). GPCRs transduce extracellular signals into intracellular effectors and control a number of physiological responses, including vision, cognition, metabolism, cardiac function, and neurotransmission (3Seachrist J.L. Ferguson S.S. Life Sci. 2003; 74: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Abnormal and/or dysregulated GPCR signaling has been associated with many human diseases, including various types of cancer. G protein-coupled receptors 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor early endosome antigen 1 epidermal growth factor receptor lysosome-associated membrane protein mannose 6-phosphate receptor serotonin not transfected scrambled. GPCRs are activated at the plasma membrane by agonist binding. Following a change in the conformation of the receptors, GPCRs couple to heterotrimeric G proteins and initiate a variety of downstream signaling pathways (4Neves S.R. Ram P.T. Iyengar R. Science. 2002; 296: 1636-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). Receptor responsiveness is subsequently attenuated, a concept defined as receptor desensitization, by receptor phosphorylation, arrestin binding, and clathrin-mediated endocytosis (5Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, in addition to signal transduction cascades initiated at the plasma membrane, some receptors may continue to signal from endocytic compartments in a G protein-independent manner. It is now well established that GPCR trafficking is a critical factor that determines spatial and temporal control of GPCR signaling. Once internalized, GPCRs are sorted in the early endosomes to either recycling pathways leading to receptor resensitization, or sorted for down-regulation in lysosomes, which permanently terminates receptor signaling. Lysosomal sorting of a number of GPCRs involves a covalent modification of receptors with ubiquitin (6Shenoy S.K. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 1142-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Although some ubiquitin ligases have been identified, future work is required to further characterize and define the specific details of sorting of ubiquitinated GPCRs. In that regard, it has been reported that ubiquitination and down-regulation of protease-activated receptor 2 is mediated by c-Cbl (7Jacob C. Cottrell G.S. Gehringer D. Schmidlin F. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16076-16087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), the ubiquitin ligase that is known to regulate sorting of receptor tyrosine kinases to lysosomes (8Acconcia F. Sigismund S. Polo S. Exp. Cell Res. 2009; 315: 1610-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Receptor recycling to the plasma membrane, on the other hand, was initially thought to occur via bulk membrane flow. Recent studies, however, revealed that GPCR recycling was a highly specific process. It appeared that specific amino acids residues of GPCRs and interactions with certain sorting proteins were required for efficient trafficking of internalized receptors to the plasma membrane (9Hanyaloglu A.C. von Zastrow M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2008; 48: 537-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Previously, others have identified some GPCR interacting proteins involved in determining the fate of GPCRs. However, many aspects of GPCR intracellular trafficking remain mysterious. We have recently characterized a novel role for c-Cbl (ubiquitin ligase) in the active sorting of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to recycling endosomes. Although, c-Cbl was implicated in mediating lysosomal degradation of some GPCRs (7Jacob C. Cottrell G.S. Gehringer D. Schmidlin F. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16076-16087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), possible roles for c-Cbl in GPCR recycling have not yet been addressed. We report here that c-Cbl interacts the 5-HT2A receptor and that the carboxyl-terminal domain of c-Cbl regulates efficient 5-HT2AR recycling to the plasma membrane and receptor resensitization. Taken together, these results implicate c-Cbl in a novel sorting pathway of 5-HT2AR intracellular trafficking. Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Serotonin, cyclohexamide, and probenecid were purchased from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Rab11, mouse monoclonal anti-v5, rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibodies, and Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Invitrogen. Rabbit polyclonal anti-early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1) (clone H-300) antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse monoclonal anti-c-Cbl antibody was from BD Biosciences. Rabbit polyclonal anti-lysosome-associated membrane protein (LAMP) and rabbit polyclonal mannose 6-phosphate receptor (M6PR) antibodies were from Abcam (Cambridge, MA).

Peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). SDS-PAGE molecular weight markers were from Bio-Rad. HEK293 cells were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Cells were grown to ∼75% confluence and placed in serum-deprived binding media (minimum essential medium supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin) for 24 h prior to treatments. In all experiments 100 μg/ml of cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, was used 3 h prior to and during treatments. For synchronized ligand pulse experiments, cells at 4 °C were incubated with an agonist for 60 min in serum-deprived binding medium containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Then, the cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS to remove unbound ligand, following which the bound ligand stimulated 5-HT2AR upon exposure to pre-warmed ligand-free medium at 37 °C. A mixture of four SMARTselection-designed siRNAs targeting one gene (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Lafayette, CO) were transfected using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. A pool of 4 siGenome non-targeting siRNAs, designated as scrambled (SCR) siRNA, was used as control. 72 h following transfection, cell lysates were assayed for silencing effectiveness by Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. The expression constructs pcDNA3GFP-Cbl-WT, pcDNA3GFP-Cbl-(1–436), and pcDNA3GFP-Cbl-N have been described previously and kindly provided by Dr. Hamid Band (10Lill N.L. Douillard P. Awwad R.A. Ota S.

The 5-HT2AR-YFP receptor construct was generated by cloning the cDNA sequence of human 5-HT2AR into XhoI and BamHI sites of EYFP-N1 vector (Clontech, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the above constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Initial comparison revealed no difference between mock- and non-transfected cells. Thus, non-transfected cells were subsequently used as controls. After treatments, cells were rinsed briefly with PBS and extracted with RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS in PBS) containing protease inhibitors. Cells were subsequently sonicated, and protein concentrations were determined by the BCA assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 4–12% polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen), transferred to PVDF membranes, and blocked with 5% milk in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Following several washes with PBS containing 0.1% Tween, the membranes were incubated with the appropriate dilutions of primary and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (as directed by the manufacturer) in blocking solution. Immunoblotted proteins were detected using ECL reagents (GE Healthcare). Cells were grown on 35-mm lysine-coated, glass-bottom culture dishes (MatTek Corporation, Ashland, MA). After treatments, cells were fixed with freshly prepared 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Subsequently, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS for 5 min, following which nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 3% normal serum (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) in PBS for 1 h. Incubations with the appropriate dilutions of primary and Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (as directed by the manufacturer) were performed in blocking solution. Confocal microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 META laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) equipped with a ×60 objective, using the following laser wavelengths: excitation 488 nm, emission 505–530 nm; excitation 543 nm, emission 560–615 nm; excitation 633 nm, emission 630–700 nm. Quantifications of the colocalization coefficients, derived from measured pixel overlaps between 5-HT2AR and EEA1, Rab11, M6PR, and LAMP, were performed using Zeiss LSM 510 colocalization analysis software. The mean values were averaged from at least 16 independent single cell images. After the indicated treatments, HEK293 cells grown in 100-mm dishes were scraped into ice-cold PBS and centrifuged at 10,000 × g. Pellets were lysed in 1 ml of RIPA lysis buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors, as described above. Equal amounts of proteins were precleared by incubation for 60 min at 4 °C with normal mouse or rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA). After a brief centrifugation, the supernatants were removed and incubated overnight at 4 °C with either anti-v5 or anti-GFP antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were captured with 50 μl of either protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or TrueBlot Ig IP beads (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) at 4 °C for 1 h. The samples were then centrifuged and washed 4 times with 1 ml of RIPA buffer. Proteins were eluted from the beads using Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The membranes were incubated with the appropriate dilutions of primary and TrueBlot peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) (as directed by the manufacturer) in blocking solution. Attenuated receptor recycling was measured biochemically by the gain of intracellular receptors, which had been labeled with disulfide-linked (cleavable) biotin, following biotin stripping. Briefly, HEK293 cells were surface biotinylated with 0.5 mg/ml of cell-impermeable sulfo-NHS-S-S biotin (Pierce) in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C. Excess biotin was subsequently quenched by washing with ice-cold 15 mm glycine. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated in serum-free medium at 37 °C for 1 h prior to treatments. Cells were then incubated on ice with 1 μm 5-HT for 60 min, washed free of unbound ligand, and either collected following stripping of cell surface biotin (biotin removed), or collected without biotin stripping (cell surface receptors), or collected following exposure to prewarmed ligand-free medium at 37 °C for 180 min and cell surface biotin stripping (intracellular receptors). Stripping of cell surface-biotinylated receptors was performed at 4 °C by washing the cells three times for 5 min with ice-cold GSH cleavage buffer (50 mm GSH, 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% BSA, 0.75% 10 n NaOH). Cell lysates were subsequently subjected to avidin precipitation and immunoblotting. Cells were grown in lysine-coated 96-well clear-bottom black plates (Greiner Bio-One, Monroe, NC). After treatments, cells were loaded with Calcium 3 dye (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) for 60 min at 37 °C in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 2.5 mm probenecid. The changes in intracellular calcium were detected with fluorometric imaging plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Statistical significance was determined using analysis of variance with Dunnett's or Bonferroni post-test to correct for multiple comparisons (GraphPad Prism, version 4). p values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. First, we evaluated the ability of serotonin to induce 5-HT2AR endocytosis and intracellular trafficking in HEK293 cells. To minimize the effects of simultaneous 5-HT2AR processing, i.e. receptor endocytosis, sorting, recycling, and/or degradation, we performed a synchronized ligand pulse experiment, as described previously (12Berry S.A. Shah M.C. Khan N. Roth B.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 306-313PubMed Google Scholar), with some modifications successfully characterized by us (1Baldys A. Göoz M. Morinelli T.A. Lee M.H. Raymond Jr., J.R. Luttrell L.M. Raymond Sr., J.R. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 1462-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This protocol allowed us to track a single cohort of liganded receptors. Briefly, the cells transiently transfected with v5-tagged 5-HT2AR were allowed to bind the ligand (1 μm 5-HT) at 4 °C for 60 min, following which the unbound ligand was removed and the cells were transferred to 37 °C to initiate synchronous 5-HT2AR processing (Fig. 1A). We observed that at 0 min 5-HT2AR was mostly localized to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1A, 0 min). Some 5-HT2A receptors also were detected intracellularly, which is indicative of constitutive receptor activity (13Berg K.A. Harvey J.A. Spampinato U. Clarke W.P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 625-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Ten min after the synchronous ligand pulse, there was considerable movement of the 5-HT-stimulated 5-HT2AR into intracellular compartments (Fig. 1A, 10 min), with nearly complete internalization after 30 min (Fig. 1A, 30 min). Three hours following rewarming of the cells, the majority of 5-HT2AR re-appeared on the plasma membrane, with no detectable receptor degradation (Fig. 1A, 180 min). There was minimal internalization of 5-HT2AR in the absence of ligand (not shown), so the internalization of the receptors was the result of stimulation by 5-HT. To confirm our microscopy observations, we sought to determine the degree of 5-HT2AR down-regulation by means of immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal antibody directed against v5-tagged 5-HT2AR (Fig. 1B). This analysis revealed that treatment with 1 μm 5-HT for 180 min resulted in little or no change in the immunoreactivity of 5-HT2A receptors. We later focused our efforts on determining the intracellular localization of 5-HT2A receptors following a 30-min synchronized pulse of 5-HT. For these studies, we utilized various markers of subcellular organelles, i.e. EEA1 for early endosomes, Rab11 for the perinuclear slow recycling compartment, M6PR for late endosomes, and LAMP for lysosomes (Fig. 2A). These data show partial and high colocalization patterns of 5-HT2AR with EEA1 and Rab11, respectively, and no apparent colocalization with either M6PR or LAMP. Our microscopy observations were confirmed by evaluation of the colocalization coefficients, which measured pixel overlap between the 5-HT2A receptors and EEA1, Rab11, M6PR, or LAMP, respectively (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these results demonstrate that 5-HT-activated 5-HT2A receptors undergo endocytosis and are recycled via EEA1- and Rab11-positive intracellular compartments back to the plasma membrane. Previously, we documented a global role for c-Cbl in the regulation of vesicular sorting of EGFR (1Baldys A. Göoz M. Morinelli T.A. Lee M.H. Raymond Jr., J.R. Luttrell L.M. Raymond Sr., J.R. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 1462-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, in this work we considered the hypothesis that c-Cbl might affect recycling of 5-HT2A receptors. To study this possibility, we first determined whether 5-HT2A receptors were associated with c-Cbl. Fig. 3 shows results from co-immunoprecipitation experiments, in which non-transfected HEK293 (NT) cells or cells transiently transfected with 5-HT2AR were subjected to immunoprecipitation, followed by Western blotting of the c-Cbl. We did not observe any c-Cbl immunoreactivity in the immunoprecipitates from NT cells. In contrast, the endogenous c-Cbl was robustly co-immunoprecipitated with transiently expressed 5-HT2A receptors (Fig. 3, second lane, top panel), indicating an interaction between the two proteins. Our work does not distinguish whether this is a direct interaction, or whether it occurs through an intermediate biding partner. We next sought to determine whether the association of 5-HT2A receptors with c-Cbl had any functional consequences on recycling. To test the possibility that c-Cbl might influence the recycling of 5-HT2AR, we used a siRNA knockdown approach to selectively deplete endogenous c-Cbl (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4A, a pool of four different siRNA duplexes against c-Cbl considerably suppressed the levels of c-Cbl protein, as measured by Western blotting analysis. We then assessed the ability of 5-HT2AR to recycle under control and c-Cbl knockdown conditions in HEK293 cells transiently expressing 5-HT2AR. Fig. 4B demonstrates that 3 h after a synchronized pulse of 5-HT, 5-HT2AR recycling was not affected by scrambled siRNA (SCR siRNA, top panels), as the majority of receptors were found on the plasma membrane. In striking contrast, c-Cbl-knockdown significantly impaired the ability of 5-HT2AR to recycle as long as 3 h after a pulse of 5-HT. This was evidenced by accumulation of 5-HT2A receptors in the intracellular compartments (c-Cbl siRNA, bottom panels). These results imply that c-Cbl is required for efficient trafficking of the 5-HT2A receptors. To our knowledge this is the first evidence showing that c-Cbl is involved in GPCR recycling. Our microscopy studies presented in Fig. 4B clearly demonstrate that c-Cbl is involved in 5-HT2A receptor trafficking. Because ubiquitin activity of c-Cbl is critical for agonist-induced EGFR degradation (14Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar) and recycling (1Baldys A. Göoz M. Morinelli T.A. Lee M.H. Raymond Jr., J.R. Luttrell L.M. Raymond Sr., J.R. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 1462-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), it was essential to investigate whether ubiquitin ligase activity of c-Cbl played any role in the recycling of the 5-HT2A receptor. Accordingly, in the next set of experiments, we compared the effects of wild-type c-Cbl (c-Cbl-WT) with two C-terminal truncation c-Cbl mutants, i.e. c-Cbl-(1–436)-GFP, which maintained ubiquitin ligase activity and c-Cbl-N-GFP without ubiquitin ligase activity (Fig. 5A). First, we assessed the expression levels of truncated c-Cbl mutants by Western blotting (Fig. 5B). Briefly, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the expression plasmids encoding c-Cbl-WT-GFP and two truncated mutants of c-Cbl also tagged with GFP. Following lysis of the cells, we determined in parallel the expression of all c-Cbl variants by immunoblotting with anti-GFP antibody. As seen in Fig. 5B, the three proteins were uniformly expressed in HEK293, with expected relative mobilities on a polyacrylamide gel. We further established whether c-Cbl mutants affected the expression levels of 5-HT-induced 5-HT2A receptors (Fig. 5C), and whether c-Cbl mutants maintained the previously observed interactions between 5-HT2AR and c-Cbl (Fig. 5D). To test this, we co-transfected 5-HT2AR with c-Cbl-WT, c-Cbl-(1–436), or c-Cbl-N in HEK293 cells and exposed the cells to 1 μm 5-HT for 180 (Fig. 5C) or 5 min (Fig. 5D). Following immunoprecipitation of v5-tagged 5-HT2A receptors, we observed that neither c-Cbl-WT nor c-Cbl mutants significantly altered the overall levels of 5-HT2A receptors upon exposure to 5-HT (Fig. 5C). Most importantly, however, the quantitative analysis of c-Cbl band intensities, normalized to the total 5-HT2AR, revealed that in contrast to c-Cbl-WT (Fig. 5D, second and third lanes), c-Cbl-(1–436) and c-Cbl-N (Fig. 5D, fourth and fifth and sixth and seventh lanes, respectively) associated poorly with the 5-HT2A receptors. Interestingly, the interaction between the two proteins in cells transfected with wild-type c-Cbl remained unchanged despite exposure to 5-HT for 5 min (compare second and third lanes in Fig. 5D) and lasted throughout the 180-min stimulation (data not shown). These results could indicate that 5-HT2A receptors and c-Cbl constitutively interact with each other in the absence of the agonist. This work could also suggest that the C-terminal region of c-Cbl is mandatory for its interaction with 5-HT2A receptors, and furthermore, that the decreased interaction between c-Cbl and 5-HT2AR was independent of c-Cbl ubiquitin ligase activity. However, the situation is much more complex in that the truncation mutants both appear to function as dominant-negative constructs by preventing normal 5-HT2AR recycling by endogenous c-Cbl. Next, we investigated whether the carboxyl terminus of c-Cbl was involved in 5-HT2AR intracellular trafficking. HEK293 cells overexpressing 5-HT2A receptors and c-Cbl mutants were treated with a synchronized pulse of 1 μm 5-HT and subsequently followed for 3 h. We found that expression of wild-type c-Cbl did not change the 5-HT2AR intracellular processing profile (Fig. 6A, top panels). Indeed, the synchronization studies revealed a pattern of receptor surface expression, which was similar to that obtained with the endogenous wild-type c-Cbl (compare Fig. 1A, bottom panels, 180 min, with Fig. 6, A, top panels, c-Cbl-WT). In contrast, c-Cbl-N and cCbl-(1–436) did not induce changes in 5-HT2AR internalization (data not shown), both mutants altered the degree of receptor recycling. These effects were clearly illustrated in confocal images, where 5-HT2A receptors were found sequestered in tightly packed, centrally located intracellular vesicles (Fig. 6A, middle panels for c-Cbl-N and bottom panels for c-Cbl-(1–436)). Our confocal microscopy analysis was confirmed by quantitative measurements of 5-HT2AR attenuated recycling. As seen in Fig. 6B, cell surface receptor biotinylation with a cleavable biotin revealed that c-Cbl-N and c-Cbl-(1–436) mutants impaired efficient 5-HT2A receptor recycling. This was evidenced by the gain of intracellular receptors following biotin stripping of cells transfected with c-Cbl-N and c-Cbl-(1–436) (Fig. 6B, compare fourth lane, c-Cbl-WT I, with seventh, c-Cbl-N I, and tenth lanes, c-Cbl-1–436 I). It should be noted that, consistent with our c-Cbl mutant results, we demonstrated that c-Cbl knockdown significantly inhibited efficient receptor recycling, as compared with cells transfected with control scrambled siRNA (supplemental Fig. S1, compare fourth lane, SCR I, and seventh lane, c-Cbl I). We next characterized receptor-containing vesicles in cells transfected with c-Cbl-N (Fig. 6C) and c-Cbl-(1–436) (data not shown) using dual-label confocal microscopy. Fig. 6C shows representative single-cell confocal images demonstrating 5-HT2AR localization following a synchronized pulse of 5-HT relative to early endosome, recycling endosome, late endosome, and lysosome markers. Our analysis revealed substantial colocalizations between 5-HT2A receptors with EEA1 and Rab11, and very minimal colocalization with M6PR and LAMP in cells expressing c-Cbl-N or c-Cbl-(1–436). To quantitatively assess the extent of 5-HT2A receptor colocalization within subplasma membrane intracellular regions, we determined the colocalization coefficients in the same manner as previously described in Fig. 2B (see Fig. 6D). These results demonstrate that expression of c-Cbl mutants lacking the carboxyl terminus lead to increased 5-HT2A receptor localization in EEA1-positive vesicles, when contrasted with results with endogenous wild-type c-Cbl in Fig. 2B, in which 5-HT2AR localized more substantially to Rab11-positive vesicles and less to EEA1-positive endosomes. It should be noted that similar results were obtained with the c-Cbl-(1–436) mutant (data not shown). Together, these findings support an essential role for the carboxyl-terminal domain of c-Cbl in the transition of receptors from early endosomes to Rab11-containing recycling vesicles, and in the efficient recycling of 5-HT2A receptor back to the plasma membrane. Based on our data in Fig. 6 we hypothesized that impaired trafficking of 5-HT2AR in the presence of c-Cbl mutants could affect receptor responsiveness. To evaluate a potential functional significance of the interaction of 5-HT2A receptors with c-Cbl, HEK293 cells transiently co-transfected with 5-HT2AR and c-Cbl constructs were subjected to a synchronized ligand pulse. 5-HT2A receptor responsiveness was subsequently assessed by analysis of Ca2+ mobilization following exposure to either buffer (“untreated”) or 1 μm 5-HT (“post-pulse”) (Fig. 7). As shown in Fig. 7A, 5-HT-induced (“post-pulse”) Ca2+ mobilization in cells expressing c-Cbl-WT and 5-HT2AR was not significantly altered following receptor trafficking in the absence (“veh”) or presence (“5-HT”) of an agonist. This suggests that expression of exogenous c-Cbl does not affect the rates of 5-HT2AR resensitization. In contrast, consistent with our observations that both c-Cbl mutants lacking the carboxyl terminus altered receptor trafficking (Fig. 6A), resensitization of 5-HT2A receptors was significantly inhibited in the presence of c-Cbl-(1–436) or c-Cbl-N (Fig. 7, B and C, respectively). A similar observation was made when 5-HT2AR resensitization was assessed under control and c-Cbl-knockdown conditions in HEK293 cells transiently expressing 5-HT2AR; c-Cbl-knockdown significantly impaired 5-HT2A receptor r"
https://openalex.org/W2058669408,"Controlled clinical trials are widely considered to be the vehicle to treatment discovery in cancer that leads to significant improvements in health outcomes including an increase in life expectancy. We have previously shown that the pattern of therapeutic discovery in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) can be described by a power law distribution. However, the mechanism generating this pattern is unknown. Here, we propose an explanation in terms of the social relations between researchers in RCTs. We use social network analysis to study the impact of interactions between RCTs on treatment success. Our dataset consists of 280 phase III RCTs conducted by the NCI from 1955 to 2006. The RCT networks are formed through trial interactions formed i) at random, ii) based on common characteristics, or iii) based on treatment success. We analyze treatment success in terms of survival hazard ratio as a function of the network structures. Our results show that the discovery process displays power law if there are preferential interactions between trials that may stem from researchers' tendency to interact selectively with established and successful peers. Furthermore, the RCT networks are “small worlds”: trials are connected through a small number of ties, yet there is much clustering among subsets of trials. We also find that treatment success (improved survival) is proportional to the network centrality measures of closeness and betweenness. Negative correlation exists between survival and the extent to which trials operate within a limited scope of information. Finally, the trials testing curative treatments in solid tumors showed the highest centrality and the most influential group was the ECOG. We conclude that the chances of discovering life-saving treatments are directly related to the richness of social interactions between researchers inherent in a preferential interaction model."
