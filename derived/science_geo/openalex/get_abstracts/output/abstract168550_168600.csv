https://openalex.org/W2153689486,"The inhibitor-of-apoptosis proteins (IAPs) play a critical role in the regulation of apoptosis by binding and inhibiting caspases. Reaper family proteins and Smac/DIABLO use a conserved amino-terminal sequence to bind to IAPs in flies and mammals, respectively, blocking their ability to inhibit caspases and thus promoting apoptosis. Here we have identified the serine protease Omi/HtrA2 as a second mammalian XIAP-binding protein with a Reaper-like motif. This protease autoprocesses to form a protein with amino-terminal homology to Smac/DIABLO and Reaper family proteins. Full-length Omi/HtrA2 is localized to mitochondria but fails to interact with XIAP. Mitochondria also contain processed Omi/HtrA2, which, following apoptotic insult, translocates to the cytosol, where it interacts with XIAP. Overexpression of Omi/HtrA2 sensitizes cells to apoptosis, and its removal by RNA interference reduces cell death. Omi/HtrA2 thus extends the set of mammalian proteins with Reaper-like function that are released from the mitochondria during apoptosis.

Vaux D.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1821-1827PubMed Google Scholar). With the exception of the last two, which are thought to have cell cycle functions, these proteins bind to and inhibit both initiator caspases such as caspase-9 and effector caspases such as caspase-3 and -7. In Drosophila, the IAPs DIAP1 and -2 are prevented from neutralizing caspases by interaction with the proapoptotic proteins Reaper, Grim, and Hid, which bind to their baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR) domains (2Hay B.A. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1045-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This interaction is mediated by the amino-terminal regions of Reaper, Grim, and Hid, which share a sequence motif that is sufficient to bind IAPs. In mammals, a protein has recently been characterized that interacts with IAPs in a similar manner to Reaper; Smac, also known as DIABLO, binds the BIR3 domain of XIAP and prevents its inhibition of caspase-9 (3Verhagen A.M.

Smac/DIABLO thus acts, at least in part, to neutralize the antiapoptotic effect of XIAP and sensitizes cells to programmed cell death in response to a number of stimuli. This activity of Smac/DIABLO is thought to be regulated by its sequestration in mitochondria from which it is released following apoptotic stimuli. Here we identify and characterize another protein, the serine protease Omi/HtrA2, that forms complexes with XIAP at high stoichiometry, and we demonstrate its importance in the regulation of apoptosis. A pNRTIS-33 expression construct encoding XIAP fused to the TAP tag (11Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar) containing a 6-glycine spacer between the two open reading frames and a Kozak initiation site was generated by PCR. After calcium phosphate-mediated transfection, HEK 293 cells stably expressing the fusion protein were selected as described previously (12Tenev T. Bohmer S.A. Kaufmann R. Frese S. Bittorf T. Beckers T. Bohmer F.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). TAP purification was performed as described previously (on the Internet; see the EMBL Web site, www.embl-heidelberg.de/ExternalInfo/seraphin/TAP.html) with the following changes. Cells were lysed in IPP150M2 (50 mmTris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EGTA, 1 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin A), and proteins in the soluble fraction were recovered by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 10 min. TEV cleavage buffer was 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mmdithiothreitol. Nonidet P-40 was replaced with Triton X-100 throughout the procedure. Purified material was resolved by denaturing PAGE, and proteins were stained with colloidal Coomassie (Sigma). Lysates prepared from 293 cells were incubated with either anti-HtrA2 Ab (931 (13Gray C.W. Ward R.V. Karran E. Turconi S. Rowles A. Viglienghi D. Southan C. Barton A. Fantom K.G. West A.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 5699-5710Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar)) or a control Ab (PW56) bound to Protein A-Sepharose. After a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, immunoprecipitated proteins recovered either by boiling beads in SDS sample buffer or by elution in a 10 μm concentration of either AVPSPPPAS or GVPSPPPAS peptide were separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblots were probed with anti-XIAP IgG (catalog no. H62120; Transduction Laboratories). This assay was performed using lysates from TAP tag- and XIAP-TAP-expressing 293 cells as described previously (6Liu Z. Sun C. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Betz S.F. Oost T. Herrmann J. Wu J.C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 2000; 408: 1004-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Where indicated, 1 mm AVPSPPPAS or GVPSPPPAS was added to the lysates before incubation with dATP and cytochrome c. Mitochondria were prepared from fresh mouse livers homogenized in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.3m sucrose buffer. Mitochondria were banded in a 70/30/10% Percoll step gradient in 5 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 0.3m mannitol by centrifugation (30 min at 14,400 ×g). Preparation purity was verified by electron microscopy. pcDNA3-HtrA2-EGFP expression constructs were generated by PCR. A 6-glycine spacer was always inserted between the HtrA2 open reading frame and the EGFP open reading frame. A Kozak initiation site was also inserted before the starting methionine. Mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Successful mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. U2OS cells maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and grown on glass coverslips were transiently transfected using Effectene (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h post-transfection, cells were incubated for 30 min with 100 nm Mitotracker, washed briefly with PBS, incubated with 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33342, fixed in 3.3% formaldehyde for 20 min, and mounted on glass slides using Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Cells were examined using an LSM510 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss). U2OS cells preincubated or not with 100 μm zVAD-fmk, either untreated or treated with UVC (100 J/m2), were incubated for 14 h and harvested by scraping followed by centrifugation at 450 × g for 10 min. Cells were washed once with buffer A (2 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 100 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin A, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm cytochalasin B); resuspended in buffer A supplemented with 0.01% digitonin; and passed through a 27-gauge needle 10 times. An initial centrifugation of the lysates at 900 × g for 2 min enabled the separation of nuclei from a fraction, F1, containing cytosol and other organelles. F1 was further separated in cytosol (C) and mitochondria-enriched fraction (M) by performing a centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 min. U2OS cells were transfected using Effectene in six-well cluster plates. 24 h post-transfection cells were exposed to UVC (100 J/m2) and processed 14 h after irradiation for analysis of cell death in GFP-positive cells by flow cytometry. Cells were incubated with annexin-V-PE (BD Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Analysis was performed on a FACS Vantage Flow Cytometer (Becton Dickinson) using CellQuest software. U2OS cells were plated onto 24-well plates at 10,000 cells/well. After 24 h, cells were transfected with double-stranded RNA-DNA hybrids at a final concentration of 90 nm using Effectene according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were given three 24-h spaced pulses of transfection and processed for SDS-PAGE analysis or treated with apoptosis-inducing agent 48 h after the last pulse. Oligonucleotides were from Xeragon (Zurich) and had the following sequences: control sense, 5′-r(GAGCGCACCAUCUUCUUCA)d(TT)-3′; control antisense, 5′-r(UGAAGAAGAUGGUGCGCUC)d(TT)-3′; HtrA2(1) sense, 5′-r(AACGGCUCAGGAUUCGUGG)d(TT)-3′; HtrA2(1) antisense, 5′-r(CCACGAAUCCUGAGCCGUU)d(TT)-3′; HtrA2(2) sense, 5′-r(GGGGAGUUUGUUGUUGCCA)d(TT)-3′; HtrA2(2) antisense, 5′-r(UGGCAACAACAAACUCCCC)d(TT)-3′; HtrA2(3) sense, 5′-r(GCUUUCCCGAUGUUCAGCA)d(TT)-3′; HtrA2(3) antisense, 5′-r(UGCUGAACAUCGGGAAAGC)d(TT)-3′. To assess whether Reaper-like proteins exist in mammalian cells, we investigated the identity of proteins binding to XIAP. A dual epitope-tagged form of XIAP was stably expressed in HEK 293 cells. TAP (11Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar) was used to recover the XIAP with high efficiency and high purity. As shown in Fig. 1A, the purified preparation was seen to contain a major band at about 65 kDa along with several other bands. Mass spectroscopy was used to identify these proteins by MALDI analysis and/or MS/MS sequencing. The major band plus three smaller minor bands, presumably breakdown products, were identified as XIAP. The second strongest band, at 24 kDa, was identified as Smac/DIABLO. The third most abundant band, at 35 kDa, was identified by both MALDI and MS/MS sequencing as the serine protease HtrA2 (13Gray C.W. Ward R.V. Karran E. Turconi S. Rowles A. Viglienghi D. Southan C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 2581-2588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) (see TableI). Since the size of this protein was significantly smaller than that predicted from its cDNA sequence, we performed Edman analysis of the whole protein to determine the amino-terminal sequence. As shown in TableII, Omi/HtrA2 bound to XIAP has the amino-terminal sequence AVPS, suggesting that it is processed to remove the first 133 amino acid residues (Fig. 1D). This cleavage has been reported to be the result of autoproteolysis (15Savopoulos J.W. Carter P.S. Turconi S. Pettman G.R. Karran E.H. Gray C.W. Ward R.V. Jenkins O. Creasy C.L. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 19: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This sequence shows marked homology to the amino-terminal sequence determined here for processed Smac/DIABLO bound to XIAP, AVPIAQ; Smac/DIABLO has been processed here to remove the first 55 amino acids. Omi/HtrA2 thus possesses an amino-terminal motif that is related to those of Reaper, Grim, Hid, and Smac/DIABLO, which bind to BIR domains of IAPs (5Srinivasula S.M. Hegde R. Saleh A. Datta P.

To verify that Omi/HtrA2 interacts with XIAP at endogenous levels of protein expression, an antibody raised against residues 343–361 of Omi/HtrA2 (931 (13Gray C.W. Ward R.V. Karran E. Turconi S. Rowles A. Viglienghi D. Southan C. Barton A. Fantom K.G. West A. Savopoulos J. Hassan N.J. Clinkenbeard H. Hanning C. Amegadzie B. Davis J.B. Dingwall C. Livi G.P. Creasy C.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5699-5710Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar)) was used to immunoprecipitate it from untransfected HEK 293 cells. The presence of co-immunoprecipitating XIAP was revealed by immunoblotting with XIAP-specific antibody (Fig.1B). The lower molecular weight protein detected in theInput lane (Fig. 1B) is a background band. To show that the interaction of Omi/HtrA2 with XIAP is through its amino-terminal Reaper-like motif, Omi/HtrA2 immunoprecipitates were incubated with peptides corresponding to its amino-terminal region (AVPSPPPAS, lane A) or an altered version where the first residue is replaced by glycine (GVPSPPPAS, lane G). The AVP peptide, but not the GVP form, is able to elute XIAP from Omi/HtrA2 (Fig. 1B), indicating that this region is necessary for the interaction with XIAP. The effect of the Omi/HtrA2 binding to XIAP on its ability to block caspase activation was investigated by studying the processing of caspase-3, -7, and -9 in cytosolic extracts of wild type and XIAP overexpressing 293 cell lines following the addition of cytochromec and dATP. As shown in Fig. 1C, XIAP overexpression strongly inhibits the activation of caspase-3 and -7 in this system and prevents the appearance of the p37 form of caspase-9 (which is generated by caspase-3 cleavage) but not the p35 form (which is generated by autocleavage). Inclusion of the AVP peptide corresponding to the amino-terminal of Omi/HtrA2 significantly abrogates XIAP inhibition of caspase activation, whereas the GVP peptide does not. Purified Omi/HtrA2 protein also blocked XIAP prevention of caspase activation in this in vitro system (data not shown). Analysis of the sequence of Omi/HtrA2 using PSORT II software (17Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar) suggests that it possesses a mitochondrial targeting sequence at its unprocessed amino terminus, followed by a predicted cleavage site at residue 31 (Fig. 1D). In addition, there is a predicted transmembrane domain from residue 105 to 121, suggesting that Omi/HtrA2 may be localized to mitochondrial membranes. Further processing at the AVP site (after residue 133) would release Omi/HtrA2 from membrane attachment. To investigate the intracellular localization of endogenous Omi/HtrA2, biochemical fractionation was performed on mouse liver. Omi/HtrA2 was localized in the mitochondria but not the cytosol (Fig.2A). It was found as two forms, one of about 50 kDa, likely to be close to full-length (F in Fig. 2A), and the other about 35 kDa, the same as that seen bound to XIAP, presumably processed to start at the AVP sequence (P in Fig.2A). To further characterize the distribution of Omi/HtrA2, a series of vectors were designed to express fusions with enhanced GFP (Fig. 2B). As shown in Fig. 2C, when transiently expressed in U2OS cells, Omi/HtrA2-GFP shows mitochondrial distribution, co-staining with the mitochondrion-selective probe Mitotracker. In addition, some Omi/HtrA2-GFP is also detectable in the nucleus. A protease-inactive form of Omi/HtrA2 in which the catalytic serine 306 has been mutated to alanine shows similar localization to wild type. A truncation mutant lacking the putative mitochondrial localization motif in the first 33 amino acid residues shows distribution throughout the cell with no obvious concentration in the mitochondria, suggesting that this short amino-terminal sequence is critical for mitochondrial targeting. A deletion mutant starting with the AVP Reaper-related motif following the initiating methionine (Δ133 HtrA2-EGFR) also shows diffuse staining throughout the cell. This protein did not, however, bind to XIAP; analysis of the protein produced by this construct by mass spectroscopy indicated that, while the initiating methionine was removed in the cell, unlike the endogenous protein the amino-terminal alanine was acetylated (data not shown), a modification known to block the interaction of Smac/DIABLO peptides with XIAP (6Liu Z. Sun C. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Betz S.F. Oost T. Herrmann J. Wu J.C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 2000; 408: 1004-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). To investigate the localization of Omi/HtrA2 at higher resolution, we performed immunoelectron microscopy on cells stably expressing full-length Omi/HtrA2-GFP. This analysis showed Omi/HtrA2 expression principally in the mitochondria (Fig. 2D), with notable proximity to the inner mitochondrial membrane. Specific mitochondrial labeling density was estimated to be 2.5 particles/μm2 using the Point-Hit method (18Rabouille C. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 117: 125-144PubMed Google Scholar), compared with 0.2 particles/μm2 outside the mitochondria (n = 23). To address the behavior of Omi/HtrA2 during apoptosis, we compared its subcellular localization in healthy cells with those challenged with an apoptotic stimulus (Fig. 2E). As previously seen in mitochondria from mouse liver (Fig. 2A), in U2OS cells Omi/HtrA2 is found as a 35-kDa form, presumably processed to an amino-terminal AVP motif, and a longer form of 50 kDa. The 35-kDa processed form of Omi/HtrA2, but not the longer form, is also seen to some extent in nuclear fractions (data not shown), but neither are found in the cytosol. Upon induction of apoptosis by subjecting the cells to ultraviolet irradiation, processed Omi/HtrA2 appears in the cytosolic fraction. The appearance of Omi/HtrA2 in the cytosol following ultraviolet irradiation was not blocked by treatment of U2OS cells with the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk, although this did block caspase-9 activation and cytochrome c release from mitochondria (Fig. 2E, center) as well as PARP cleavage (data not shown). This suggests that translocation of Omi/HtrA2 from mitochondria to cytosol is not dependent on caspase activity and is regulated in a different manner to cytochromec release from mitochondria. Distinct regulation of the release of Smac/DIABLO and cytochrome c from mitochondria has also been recently reported (19Chauhan D. Rosen S. Reed J.C. Kharbanda S. Anderson K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24453-24456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). To look at this in a simplerin vitro system, recombinant BID was added to purified mouse liver mitochondria, resulting in the release of cytochrome c(Fig. 2E, right). This was accompanied by the release from the mitochondria of the processed, but not the long, form of Omi/HtrA2, and a reduction in the amount of processed Omi/HtrA2 remaining in mitochondria. By contrast, another mitochondrial protein, cytochrome oxidase, was not released. Presumably, the longer form of Omi/HtrA2 is retained in the mitochondria by its transmembrane sequence (residues 105–121), while the processed form, lacking the first 133 amino acids and starting with the AVP motif, is free to translocate from the mitochondria upon the appropriate stimulus. These data suggest that Omi/HtrA2 may promote apoptosis by binding to IAPs in the same manner as Smac/DIABLO in mammalian cells or Reaper-like proteins in the fly. To address this directly, we studied the effects of Omi/HtrA2 overexpression on the regulation of apoptosis. When overexpressed transiently in HEK 293 cells, full-length Omi/HtrA2 induced apoptosis to some extent even in the absence of apoptotic insult, while the protease-inactive mutant, S306A, had lower death-inducing ability (data not shown). Due to the high level of expression of Omi/HtrA2 under these conditions, it was possible that this represented a nonphysiological response of cells to overexpression of a serine protease. However, in U2OS cells, transient expression of Omi/HtrA2 (where considerably lower levels were achieved; data not shown) did not cause apoptosis by itself but caused marked sensitization of the cells to UV-induced apoptosis (Fig.3A), suggesting a possible synergy with the endogenous death regulatory machinery. Since overexpression of a serine protease may be able to promote cell death independently of its ability to regulate XIAP, we asked whether endogenous Omi/HtrA2 contributed to the regulation of apoptosis. To do this, we made use of RNA interference; it has recently been reported that short double-stranded RNA molecules can cause degradation of homologous mRNA in mammalian cells without triggering antiviral responses (20Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar). We therefore treated U2OS cells with synthetic double-stranded small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides based on the sequence of Omi/HtrA2 or a matched control sequence. The Omi/HtrA2 siRNA led to the elimination of Omi/HtrA2 expression in the cells (Fig.3B). XIAP expression was unaffected by any of the siRNA treatments, and the control siRNA did not alter expression of any protein tested. When U2OS cells incubated with these siRNAs were treated with ultraviolet irradiation, it was found that Omi/HtrA2 siRNA caused significant reduction in the level of cell death (Fig.3C). Thus, removal of endogenous Omi/HtrA2 renders cells significantly more resistant to induction of apoptosis, suggesting an important role for this protease in enabling apoptosis to occur efficiently. By contrast, the removal of Smac/DIABLO by RNA interference had minimal effect on the regulation of apoptosis in this system. 2L. M. Martins and J. Downward, unpublished results. Omi/HtrA2 is the second protein to be found in mammals that interacts with XIAP and possibly other IAPs in a manner analogous to Reaper-like proteins, resulting in ablation of the ability of IAPs to inhibit caspases and leading to promotion of apoptosis. Omi/HtrA2 and Smac/DIABLO are stoichiometrically the major XIAP-interacting partners in the cell, although several other proteins have been reported to interact with XIAP in addition to the caspases (21Holcik M. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 550-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Like Smac/DIABLO, it is likely that Omi/HtrA2 plays an important physiological role in removing the protective effects of IAPs by binding to BIR3 domains via amino-terminal Reaper-like sequences, although other mechanisms for interacting with IAPs and influencing apoptosis regulation may also exist (22Roberts D.L. Merrison W. MacFarlane M. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Also like Smac/DIABLO, Omi/HtrA2 is kept separate from IAPs by sequestration to the mitochondria of healthy cells. However, Omi/HtrA2 appears to have the unique function of proteolytically processing itself to generate the amino-terminal Reaper-like motif. It is clearly also a possibility that Omi/HtrA2 might also cleave other proteins to reveal similar Reaper-like motifs. A key issue for future investigation will be the identity of the physiological protease substrates for Omi/HtrA2. Very recently, the interaction of XIAP with Omi/HtrA2 has been reported by Suzuki et al. (23Suzuki Y. Imai Y. Nakayama H. Takahashi K. Takio K. Takahashi R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 613-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). We extend their observations by showing that endogenous Omi/HtrA2 is required for efficient induction of apoptosis (Fig. 3). While our other data are in broad agreement with theirs, it seems likely that the “atypical” noncaspase-mediated cell death reported by them on overexpression of a form of Omi/HtrA2 that fails to localize to mitochondria, and seen also by us in 293 cells (data not shown), may be an artifact of expressing high levels of an active serine protease within the cell. At more moderate expression levels, wild type mitochondrially localized Omi/HtrA2 will increase the sensitivity of U2OS cells to conventional apoptosis induced by UV irradiation but causes no death by itself.

This is the ""presynaptic grid"" described in early EM studies. It is completely soluble above pH 8, but reconstitutes after dialysis against pH 6. Interestingly, reconstituted particles orient and bind PSDs asymmetrically. Mass spectrometry of purified web components reveals major proteins involved in the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles and in membrane retrieval. Our data support the idea that the CNS synaptic junction is organized by transmembrane adhesion molecules interlinked in the synaptic cleft, connected via their intracytoplasmic domains to the presynaptic web on one side and to the postsynaptic density on the other. The CNS synaptic junction may therefore be conceptualized as a complicated macromolecular scaffold that isostatically bridges two closely aligned plasma membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2050720508,"SOCS (suppressor of cytokine signaling) proteins are inhibitors of cytokine signaling involved in negative feedback loops. We have recently shown that insulin increases SOCS-3 mRNA expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. When expressed, SOCS-3 binds to phosphorylated Tyr960 of the insulin receptor and prevents Stat 5B activation by insulin. Here we show that in COS-7 cells SOCS-3 decreases insulin-induced insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) tyrosine phosphorylation and its association with p85, a regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase. This mechanism points to a function of SOCS-3 in insulin resistance. Interestingly, SOCS-3 expression was found to be increased in the adipose tissue of obese mice, but not in the liver and muscle of these animals. Two polypeptides known to be elevated during obesity, insulin and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), induce SOCS-3 mRNA expression in mice. Insulin induces a transient expression of SOCS-3 in the liver, muscle, and the white adipose tissue (WAT). Strikingly, TNF-α induced a sustained SOCS-3 expression, essentially in the WAT. Moreover, transgenic ob/ob mice lacking both TNF receptors have a pronounced decrease in SOCS-3 expression in the WAT compared with ob/ob mice, providing genetic evidence for a function of this cytokine in obesity-induced SOCS-3 expression. As SOCS-3 appears as a TNF-α target gene that is elevated during obesity, and as SOCS-3 antagonizes insulin-induced IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, we suggest that it is a player in the development of insulin resistance.

It results from a diminished biological response of tissues to insulin, termed insulin resistance, and the failure of increased insulin secretion to compensate for this resistance. Its progression parallels that of obesity. Indeed, association between insulin resistance and obesity has been recognized for decades (1Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 2001; 104: 531-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis linking these two syndromes is not yet clearly defined. In humans the concentration of several circulating molecules, such as glucose, free fatty acids, and insulin, as well as the levels of TNF-α in animal models, are increased during obesity, and these molecules have been proposed to play a role in the development of insulin resistance (2Saltiel A.R. Cell. 2001; 104: 517-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 3Sethi J.K. Hotamisligil G.S. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). At the cellular level, a general decrease in insulin signaling is observed and defects occur via several mechanisms (4Kahn B.B. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (2462) Google Scholar). First, the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity is diminished (2Saltiel A.R. Cell. 2001; 104: 517-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Moreover, the coupling of the insulin receptor substrates with the insulin receptor is impaired (2Saltiel A.R. Cell. 2001; 104: 517-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). As a consequence, all the signaling events downstream of the insulin receptor are defective, leading to decreased cellular responses. Several hypotheses, which are not mutually exclusive, have been proposed to explain these defects (4Kahn B.B. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (2462) Google Scholar). Among them the following have been reported: (i) a decrease in the expression of key molecules such as the insulin receptor and GLUT 4 (5Kahn B.B. Cell. 1998; 92: 593-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), (ii) an increased expression of the phosphotyrosine phosphatases LAR and PTP-1B, potentially involved in the dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor and IRS-1 (6Goldstein B.J. Ahmad F. Ding W. Li P.M. Zhang W.R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), and (iii) serine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor by certain protein kinase C isoforms (7Bossenmaier B. Mosthaf L.

The serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 results in diminished insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity and coupling of IRS-1 with the insulin receptor. However, due to the complexity of the insulin resistance syndrome, it is anticipated that other mechanisms are involved, which are likely to act in concert. Recently, a new class of inhibitory molecules, the SOCS (suppressor of cytokine signaling) proteins, has been identified (13Starr R. Willson T.A. Viney E.M. Murray L.J. Rayner J.R. Jenkins B.J.

Kishimoto T. Nature. 1997; 387: 921-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). The SOCS protein family consists presently of eight members that all contain a central SH2 domain and a conserved C-terminal domain, the SOCS box (16Hilton D.J. Richardson R.T. Alexander W.S. Viney E.M. Willson T.A. Sprigg N.S. Starr R. Nicholson S.E. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). SOCS proteins are induced by several cytokines, in various tissues, in a cytokine- and tissue-specific manner. Once induced, they are involved in negative feedback loops leading to decreased cytokine signaling. Different mechanisms allow the SOCS to modulate the cytokine-activated Jak/Stat pathway (17Krebs D.L. Hilton D.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2813-2819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They can either bind to Jak and inhibit their tyrosine kinase activity (14Endo T.A. Masuhara M. Yokouchi M. Suzuki R. Sakamoto H. Mitsui K. Matsumoto A. Tanimura S. Ohtsubo M. Misawa H. Miyazaki T. Leonor N. Taniguchi T. Fujita T. Kanakura Y. Komiya S. Yoshimura A. Nature. 1997; 387: 921-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar) or bind to the cytoplasmic tail of the receptors, thus preventing Stat binding and activation (18Matsumoto A. Masuhara M. Mitsui K. Yokouchi M. Ohtsubo M. Misawa H. Miyajima A. Yoshimura A. Blood. 1997; 89: 3148-3154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By their ability to be rapidly induced and to efficiently inhibit Jak/Stat pathway, SOCS proteins are potent modulators of cytokine physiology in vivo. This is illustrated by the marked phenotype of the knock-out mice. Indeed, the SOCS-3 knock-out is embryonic lethal for reasons still under debate (19Marine J.C. McKay C. Wang D. Topham D.J.

Starr R. Nicola N. Hilton D. Alexander W. Nature. 2000; 405: 1069-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Although the SOCS were originally described in cytokine signaling pathways, we have shown recently that they also belong to the insulin signaling circuitry (25Emanuelli B. Peraldi P. Filloux C. Sawka-Verhelle D. Hilton D. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15958-15991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Indeed, insulin increases SOCS-3 mRNA expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. When expressed, SOCS-3 is located in the cytoplasm under basal conditions. Following insulin treatment, we found that it translocates to the plasma membrane, where it colocalizes with the insulin receptor. SOCS-3 probably binds directly to phosphotyrosine 960 of the insulin receptor, since the hormone-induced translocation and colocalization are not observed in cells expressing an insulin receptor mutated on this residue. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid experiments show that SOCS-3 binds through its SH2 domain to this receptor residue. This association results in a competition with Stat 5B to bind to the insulin receptor, thus preventing the activation of the transcription factor by insulin. Interestingly, this site also belongs to the unique binding motif for most of the insulin receptor substrates. Here we studied whether SOCS-3 could be considered as a more general inhibitor of insulin signaling pathways, and we investigated its potential involvement in insulin resistance. We show that SOCS-3 expression reduces insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and its subsequent association with p85, a regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase. Moreover, SOCS-3 expression was found to be increased in the white adipose tissue (WAT) of obese animals. Interestingly, TNF-α, which has been proposed to play a role in the insulin resistant state observed in obesity, induces SOCS-3 expression mainly in the WAT. Finally, compared with ob/ob mice, a pronounced decrease in SOCS-3 expression was observed in the WAT of transgenic ob/ob mice devoid of TNF-α signaling. This study shows that TNF-α, a molecule known to be involved in the insulin resistant state of obese rodents, is responsible, at least in part, for an increase of SOCS-3 expression in the WAT of obese rodents and that SOCS-3 is an inhibitor of insulin signaling. The human insulin receptor cDNA (obtained from A. Ullrich) and the human insulin receptor substrate 1 cDNA (obtained from M. White) were subcloned in pCDNA3. COS-7 fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method as described in Ref. 26Maniatis T. Fritsch E. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.42-16.44Google Scholar and were depleted in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin 18 h before the experiments. Monoclonal anti-FLAG antibodies (M2) were purchased from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal serum against IRS-1 and monoclonal antibody against insulin receptor (used for immunoprecipitation) were produced in our laboratory. Monoclonal antibody against insulin receptor (for Western blotting) and rabbit polyclonal anti p85PI3K were purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA) and Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), respectively. Cells were starved overnight and then stimulated or not with 100 nm insulin for 5 min. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer. Whole-cell lysates were mixed with various antibodies (as specified under “Results”) and protein A- or G-coupled to agarose beads. Proteins from whole-cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, then transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and blotted with various antibodies (as specified under “Results”). Finally, membranes were incubated with radioactive iodinated protein A, and proteins were revealed by autoradiography or by a Storm 840 apparatus, Molecular Dynamics (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) and quantified using NIH Image or Imagequant. All mouse strains were housed and raised on open formula rations. Water was given ad libitum with a 12-h light-dark cycle. Male OF1 mice (IFFA CREDO, L’Arbresle, France) (about 40 g) were starved overnight and then injected intraperitoneally with a saline solution (9% NaCl (w/v)) or insulin (1 milliunit/g). Mice were euthanized 1, 2, 3, or 4 h after injection. In a second set of experiments, male OF1 mice were injected intraperitoneally with recombinant human TNF-α (TEBU, Le Perray-en-Yvelines, France), 4 μg per mouse, or with saline solution. Mice were euthanized 1, 2, 4, or 8 h after injection. Male C57BL/6OlaHsd-Lepob (ob/ob) mice, male C57BL/KsOlaHsd-Leprdb (db/db) mice, and lean controls were obtained from Harlan (Gannat, France). They were euthanized at 12 or 14 weeks of age, respectively, when the lean controls weighed 30 g and the obese mice 60 g. In each experiment, skeletal muscle, liver, and peri-epidydimal fat were quickly removed for RNA isolation. ob/ob p55−/−p75−/− mice were obtained and characterized as described previously (27Uysal K.T. Wiesbrock S.M. Marino M.W. Hotamisligil G.S. Nature. 1997; 389: 610-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1907) Google Scholar, 28Uysal K.T. Wiesbrock S.M. Hotamisligil G.S. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4832-4838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These mice and their ob/ob p55+/+p75+/+ littermates were euthanized at 20 weeks of age for RNA isolation. Total RNA from mouse tissues was isolated with the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 20 μg of denatured total RNA was separated by electrophoresis on formaldehyde-containing 1.2% (w/v) agarose gels and transferred to positively charged nylon membranes (Ambion, Austin, TX). Full-length SOCS-3 cDNA was used as probe. The probe was labeled by random priming with [α-32P]dCTP using the Rediprime kit (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) and purified with the Probequant kit (Amersham Biosciences). A radiolabeled oligonucleotide corresponding to a 18 S RNA specific sequence was used as an internal control for RNA loading and integrity. Hybridizations were performed at 42 °C in hybridization buffer (Ambion, Austin, TX). Membranes were washed three times in 0.5× SSC, 0.5% (w/v) SDS at 42 °C and revealed by autoradiography or by a Storm 840 apparatus, Molecular Dynamics and quantified using NIH Image or Imagequant. We have previously shown that SOCS-3 inhibits the insulin-induced stimulation of Stat 5B (25Emanuelli B. Peraldi P. Filloux C. Sawka-Verhelle D. Hilton D. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15958-15991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (385) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that this inhibition was the result of a competition between SOCS-3 and Stat 5B to bind to the phosphorylated Tyr960 of the insulin receptor. As established substrates of the insulin receptor, such as IRS-1, bind to this residue to undergo phosphorylation by the insulin receptor, we investigated whether SOCS-3 could interfere with IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to insulin. COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the insulin receptor or IRS-1 and with pEF-SOCS-3. Cells were stimulated or not with insulin for 5 min and lysed. The insulin receptor and IRS-1 were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by an antiphosphotyrosine Western blot. Expression levels of IR, IRS-1, and SOCS-3 were measured in total cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 1, expression of SOCS-3 decreased the insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 by 80%. Under these conditions, the decrease occurred without modification of IRS-1 or of insulin receptor expression. However, higher expression of pEF-SOCS-3 lead to a decrease in both insulin receptor and IRS-1 proteins (data not shown). As described previously, SOCS-3 expression did not modify the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity (25Emanuelli B. Peraldi P. Filloux C. Sawka-Verhelle D. Hilton D. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15958-15991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (385) Google Scholar,29Kawazoe Y. Naka T. Fujimoto M. Kohzaki H. Morita Y. Narazaki M. Okumura K. Saitoh H. Nakagawa R. Uchiyama Y. Akira S. Kishimoto T. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Once phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by the insulin receptor, IRS-1 becomes a docking molecule for SH2-domain containing proteins, such as the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase. As SOCS-3 expression decreased insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, we investigated whether it could impair the association between IRS-1 and p85PI3K. COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the insulin receptor or IRS-1 and with increasing amounts of pEF-SOCS-3. Cells were stimulated with insulin for 5 min and thereafter lysed. IRS-1 was immunoprecipitated, and the obtained immunocomplexes were analyzed by an anti-phosphotyrosine and an anti-p85 Western blot (Fig.2). Expression levels for IRS-1 and SOCS-3 were measured on total cell lysates. As observed, the decrease in the insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 upon SOCS-3 expression is associated with a loss of association between endogenous p85PI3K and IRS-1. As SOCS-3 appears as an inhibitor of insulin signaling, we studied its expression during obesity, a pathological situation known to be associated with insulin resistance. Liver, skeletal muscle, and peri-epididymal fat from ob/ob or db/db mice or their lean counterparts were removed. Total RNAs were isolated and analyzed by Northern blot using SOCS-3 cDNA as a probe. As illustrated in Fig.3, SOCS-3 mRNA expression was increased 4-fold and 5.5-fold in the WAT of db/db and ob/ob mice, respectively, compared with their lean controls. By contrast, SOCS-3 mRNA was not detected in the muscle and the liver of either the obese or the lean animals. These data indicate that SOCS-3 is up-regulated preferentially in the WAT of obese animals. Obesity is usually associated with hyperinsulinemia and with an up-regulation of TNF-α mainly in WAT. Therefore, we investigated in mice the effect of these two polypeptides on SOCS-3 mRNA expression. We have reported previously that in 3T3L1 adipocytes insulin increases SOCS-3 mRNA expression. Here we studied SOCS-3 mRNA expression in insulin target tissues of animals injected with the hormone. OF1 mice were starved overnight and injected either with a saline solution or with insulin. Mice were euthanized 1, 2, 3, or 4 h after injection and the liver, hindleg muscles, and peri-epididymal fat (WAT) were removed. Total RNAs were isolated and analyzed by Northern blot (Fig.4). SOCS-3 mRNA expression was increased 11-fold or 33-fold after 2 h in WAT and skeletal muscle, respectively, and 5.5-fold in the liver 1 h after injection. In these three tissues, the expression was sustained for 1 h and returned to basal levels within 2 h after induction. We next examined the effect of TNF-α on SOCS-3 expression in insulin-sensitive tissues. OF1 mice were injected intraperitoneally either with a saline solution or with TNF-α. Mice were euthanized 1, 2, 4, or 8 h after injection, and thereafter the liver, hindleg muscles, and WAT were removed. Total RNAs were isolated and analyzed by Northern blot. As shown in Fig. 5, SOCS-3 mRNA expression was increased 70-fold in WAT following TNF-α treatment. This induction was observed within 1 h after injection, was sustained at least for 3 h, then diminished after 8 h of treatment and returned to basal levels after 24 h (data not shown). TNF-α also induced SOCS-3 mRNA expression in skeletal muscle and in the liver, although the magnitude of this induction seems to be much smaller and more transient than in the WAT. Indeed, SOCS-3 mRNA appeared within 2 h after injection and returned to basal levels in these tissues within 4 h of treatment. As both TNF-α and SOCS-3 are elevated in the WAT of obese animals, and as we found that TNF-α induces SOCS-3 in WAT, we investigated whether TNF-α was involved in the increased expression of SOCS-3 seen in obese mice. Therefore, we analyzed SOCS-3 expression in ob/ob mice deleted of the two known TNF receptors, i.e. ob/ob p55−/−p75−/− mice (27Uysal K.T. Wiesbrock S.M. Marino M.W. Hotamisligil G.S.

As shown, the absence of TNF-α signaling was associated with a 70% decrease in SOCS-3 mRNA expression. This genetic model of absence of TNF-α signaling indicates that the increase in SOCS-3 expression observed in ob/ob mice is linked to TNF-α. The insulin receptor mediates its biological effects through tyrosine phosphorylation of several substrates, among them the IRS, Shc, and Stat 5B. This phosphorylation is dependent on a functional coupling between the insulin receptor and its substrates. The coupling can be direct, for instance through the interaction between phosphorylated tyrosine 960 (pTyr960) of the insulin receptor and the phosphotyrosine binding domains of IRS and Shc (30White M.F.

Van Obberghen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 33Chen J. Sadowski H.B. Kohanski R.A. Wang L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2295-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The coupling insulin receptor/substrate can also be indirect through the PH domain of IRS (34Burks D.J. Pons S. Towery H. Smith-Hall J. Myers M.G. Yenush L. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27716-27721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These pleckstrin homology domains may bind to acidic peptide motifs in membrane proteins or to phospholipids that link substrates to activated cell surface insulin receptors (35Burks D.J. Wang J.

As a consequence, any molecular event impairing the coupling between the insulin receptor and its substrates should lead to a decrease in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the latter molecules. Recently, we have revealed that SOCS-3 could be considered as such a molecule, which is able to hamper the interaction between the insulin receptor and one of its substrates, Stat 5B (25Emanuelli B. Peraldi P. Filloux C. Sawka-Verhelle D. Hilton D. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15958-15991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Indeed, SOCS-3 expression reduces insulin-induced DNA binding activity of Stat 5B, probably through a competition between Stat 5B and SOCS-3 for binding to the insulin receptor pTyr960. We have evaluated the impact of SOCS-3 on insulin signaling by investigating whether SOCS-3 interferes with the tyrosine phosphorylation of the key insulin receptor substrate, IRS-1. Indeed, although Stat 5B may participate in the transcriptional control of some insulin target genes (36Sawka-Verhelle D. Tartare-Deckert S. Decaux J.F. Girard J. Van Obberghen E. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1977-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), IRS-1, through its engagement with PI3K, Grb2 and SHP2, is thought to control several major cellular processes regulated by insulin such as glucose uptake, protein and glycogen synthesis, and gene expression (37White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Since, however, Stat 5B and IRS-1 interact with the insulin receptor through distinct mechanisms, the effect of SOCS-3 on IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation could differ. Indeed, Stat 5B and SOCS-3 bind to the insulin receptor through their SH2 domain, while IRS-1 uses its PTB domain. Even if the affinity of PTB and SH2 domains for the association with pTyr960 are likely to be in the same order of magnitude (38Shoelson S.E. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997; 1: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), they do not recognize the same binding motif. A SH2 domain is expected to interact with pTyr960 and amino acids located in the N terminus of the motif containing pTyr960, whereas a PTB domain is anticipated to bind pTyr960 but is more dependent upon residues located in the C terminus of the motif containing pTyr960. Moreover, IRS-1 possesses a PH domain, which has been proposed to play a crucial role in insulin-induced IRS-1 phosphorylation in intact cells (39Yenush L. Makati K.J. Smith-Hall J. Ishibashi O. Myers M.G. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24300-24306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Here we show that SOCS-3 expression reduces insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and its subsequent association with p85PI3K. From these results and previous studies, it would appear that the binding of SOCS-3 to Tyr960 prevents the coupling of IRS-1 with the insulin receptor both through its PTB and PH domains. Therefore, we suggest that SOCS-3 is a potent inhibitor of insulin signaling. This is of particular interest, since we find that SOCS-3 expression is increased in several situations associated with insulin resistance. At least two recent reports have pointed toward a function of the SOCS in insulin resistance. Using transfected cells, Mooney et al. (40Mooney R.A. Senn J. Cameron S. Inamdar N. Boivin L.M. Shang Y. Furlanetto R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25889-25893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) showed that SOCS-1 and SOCS-6 inhibit insulin-induced activation of MAP kinase and of PKB. Based on in vitro reconstitution experiments with partially purified insulin receptor and recombinant IRS-1, the authors suggest that these SOCS inhibit insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity. However, using intact cells, they did not observe a modification of insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, and furthermore IRS-1 phosphorylation was not studied. A role for SOCS-1 in the control of glucose homeostasis has been proposed by Kawazoe et al. (29Kawazoe Y. Naka T. Fujimoto M. Kohzaki H. Morita Y. Narazaki M. Okumura K. Saitoh H. Nakagawa R. Uchiyama Y. Akira S. Kishimoto T. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). They reported that insulin sensitivity was increased in SOCS-1-deficient mice. In transfected cells, they show that SOCS-1, and SOCS-3 to a lesser extent, inhibit insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. They suggest that this inhibition is linked to a decrease in Jak activity. This work could have important physiological significance, since it provides evidence for a role of SOCS-1 in the regulation of insulin sensitivity. However, one can argue that although the Jaks phosphorylate IRS, it is generally assumed that most of the insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 is due to the insulin receptor itself. Therefore, our hypothesis of a competition occurring between SOCS-3 and IRS-1 to bind to the insulin receptor provides us with a more plausible explanation for the observed decrease in IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Second, SOCS-1 is nearly undetectable in insulin-sensitive tissues, and when induced, its expression is transient (data not shown). Therefore, the situations in which SOCS-1 triggers insulin resistance remain uncertain. Here we show that SOCS-3 expression is increased in the WAT of obese mice. No modification was observed in skeletal muscle and, in agreement with a previous study, in the liver (41Emilsson V. Arch J. de Groot R. Lister C. Cawthorne M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It is tempting to propose that this SOCS-3 expression may participate in the development of insulin resistance in the WAT, since we show that sustained high SOCS-3 expression is hampering insulin signaling. Interestingly, an obesity-induced up-regulation of SOCS-3 mRNA expression has also been reported to occur in the hypothalamus of obese mice, and it has been proposed that this up-regulation is involved in leptin resistance (42Bjorbaek C. Elmquist J.K. Frantz J.D. Shoelson S.E. Flier J.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 619-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). In diet-induced obese rats, an up-regulation of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 mRNA in the adipose tissue has also been observed (43Wang Z. Zhou Y.T. Kakuma T. Lee Y. Kalra S.P. Kalra P.S. Pan W. Unger R.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Among other factors, insulinemia is known to be elevated during obesity. We have reported previously that insulin leads to SOCS-3 mRNA expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and we have proposed that this induction was linked to Stat 5B activation (25Emanuelli B. Peraldi P. Filloux C. Sawka-Verhelle D. Hilton D. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15958-15991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Recently, our results were confirmed in C2C12 myotubes by Sadowski et al. (44Sadowski C.L. Choi T.S. Le M. Wheeler T.T. Wang L.H. Sadowski H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20703-20710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We find here that SOCS-3 is an insulin-target gene in major classical insulin-sensitive tissues. However, insulin-induced SOCS-3 expression is not limited to one tissue, as it is observed in the muscle, liver, and WAT. Moreover, the increase in SOCS-3 expression was transient. This suggests that hyperinsulinemia is not the leading cause of the WAT-specific increased expression of SOCS-3 during obesity. Obesity has also been associated with an increased expression of TNF-α in the WAT (45Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6147) Google Scholar). Several reports have illustrated the role of TNF-α in obesity-associated insulin resistance in rodents, while its precise contribution to insulin resistance in humans is debated (3Sethi J.K. Hotamisligil G.S. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar,46Peraldi P. Spiegelman B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). We show in Fig. 5 that in mice intraperitoneally injected with TNF-α SOCS-3 mRNA expression is induced in insulin-sensitive tissues. This induction is more pronounced and sustained in the WAT compared with liver and skeletal muscle. So far, the molecular mechanisms leading to SOCS-3 expression in response to TNF-α have not been identified. Usually, SOCS transcription is induced by cytokines through activation of transcription factors of the Stat family (17Krebs D.L. Hilton D.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2813-2819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although TNF-α has been shown to activate certain Stat to some extent (47Guo D. Dunbar J.D. Yang C.H. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2742-2750PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that the effect of TNF-α on SOCS-3 expression is indirect. Indeed, two reports indicate that TNF-α induces SOCS-3 expression in the liver (48Hong F. Nguyen V.A. Gao B. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1595-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 49Campbell J.S. Prichard L. Schaper F. Schmitz J. Stephenson-Famy A. Rosenfeld M.E. Argast G.M. Heinrich P.C. Fausto N. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1285-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), but not in primary hepatocytes and in HepG2 cells. Therefore, it was suggested that other cytokines, induced by TNF-α, were responsible for SOCS-3 expression. Conflicting observations were obtained with transgenic mice lacking interleukin-6 on the effect of this interleukin on TNF-α induction of SOCS-3 in the liver (48Hong F. Nguyen V.A. Gao B. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1595-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 49Campbell J.S. Prichard L. Schaper F. Schmitz J. Stephenson-Famy A. Rosenfeld M.E. Argast G.M. Heinrich P.C. Fausto N. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1285-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). At this point we hypothesized that a paracrine mechanism involving TNF-α could explain the increased SOCS-3 expression observed in WAT of obese mice. To test this we studied SOCS-3 expression in ob/ob mice and in ob/ob transgenic mice deficient in both p55TNFR and p75TNFR (ob/ob p55−/−p75−/−), the two known receptors for TNF. It has previously been reported that these transgenic mice have a higher insulin sensitivity compared with their controls (27Uysal K.T. Wiesbrock S.M. Marino M.W. Hotamisligil G.S. Nature. 1997; 389: 610-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1907) Google Scholar, 28Uysal K.T. Wiesbrock S.M. Hotamisligil G.S. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4832-4838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found a pronounced decrease in SOCS-3 expression in obese mice lacking TNF-α signaling. These data provide genetic evidence supporting the idea that the elevated levels of SOCS-3 expression found in obesity is linked to increased TNF-α expression. Several molecular mechanisms have been proposed to explain TNF-α-induced insulin resistance. Although some divergence exists among the different reports, they all point toward an important role of IRS-1 phosphorylation on serine residues, thought to be responsible for the decrease in insulin signaling (3Sethi J.K. Hotamisligil G.S. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 46Peraldi P. Spiegelman B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). TNF-α-induced SOCS-3 expression could represent a newly identified means for this cytokine to diminish the cellular responses to insulin. Altogether our results show that SOCS-3 negatively regulates insulin signaling. Moreover, our evidence of increased SOCS-3 expression in situations associated with insulin resistance leads us to propose that SOCS-3 participates in the development of this syndrome. Such deleterious actions of SOCS-3 could be operational not only at the periphery but also in the central nervous system. Jointly, these SOCS-3 effects would result in insulin resistance and disturbed energy expenditure. To conclude, SOCS-3 may constitute a newly recognized molecular target for the prevention and/or treatment of insulin resistance.

However, neither the conditions necessary for triggering complex spikes, nor their computational function are well understood. CA1 pyramidal cell burst activity was examined in behaving rats. The fraction of bursts was not reliably higher in place field centers, but rather in places where discharge frequency was 6-7 Hz. Burst probability was lower and bursts were shorter after recent spiking activity than after prolonged periods of silence (100 ms-1 s). Burst initiation probability and burst length were correlated with extracellular spike amplitude and with intracellular action potential rising slope.

To determine why ACE affects susceptibility to AD, we examined the effect of purified ACE on aggregation of the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ)in vitro. Surprisingly, ACE was found to significantly inhibit Aβ aggregation in a dose response manner. The inhibition of aggregation was specifically blocked by preincubation of ACE with an ACE inhibitor, lisinopril. ACE was confirmed to retard Aβ fibril formation with electron microscopy. ACE inhibited Aβ deposits on a synthaloid plate, which was used to monitor Aβ deposition on autopsied brain tissue. ACE also significantly inhibited Aβ cytotoxicity on PC12 h. The most striking fact was that ACE degraded Aβ by cleaving Aβ-(1–40) at the site Asp7-Ser8. This was proven with reverse-phase HPLC, amino acid sequence analysis, and MALDI-TOF/MS. Compared with Aβ-(1–40), aggregation and cytotoxic effects of the degradation products Aβ-(1–7) and Aβ-(8–40) peptides were reduced or virtually absent. These findings led to the hypothesis that ACE may affect susceptibility to AD by degrading Aβ and preventing the accumulation of amyloid plaques in vivo.

Amyloid protein is derived from the integral membrane polypeptide, β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP). The released 39–43 residue amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) may subsequently undergo aggregation to form amyloid fibrils under the influence of various amyloid-associated factors (2Selkoe D.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 489-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). The aggregation and deposition of Aβ has been linked to the toxic effects causing cell damage in AD. Because Aβ is present in both normal and AD subjects, an answer to the question of why Aβ accumulates in AD but not in the normal brain may lead to a possible cure for AD. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, EC3.4.15.1) is a membrane-bound ectoenzyme. It catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I (AngI) to angiotensin II (AngII), which plays an important role in blood pressure and body fluid and sodium homeostasis (3Reid I.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: E763-E778PubMed Google Scholar). The cloning of the ACE gene revealed a 287-bp insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism in intron 16. The serum ACE activity of the ACE DD genotype was twice as high as that of the ACE II genotype (4Rigat B. Hubert C. Alhenc-Gelas F. Cambien F. Corvol P. Soubrier F. J. Clin.

The ACE genotype is considered to be associated with hypertension, coronary artery disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, myocardial infarction, and diabetic nephropathy (5Abbud Z.A. Wilson A.C.

In particular, the ACE DD genotype is considered to be a risk factor for vascular diseases. We have compared the distribution of an I/D polymorphism of the gene coding for ACE in 133 Japanese sporadic AD patients and 257 control subjects (1Hu J. Miyatake F. Aizu Y. Nakagawa H. Nakamura S.

The association between AD and ACE genotypes or alleles was found to be significant. The frequency of the ACE II genotype was 1.4× higher in AD than in controls, whereas that of ACE DD genotypes was only 0.4× as high. Moreover, the altered distribution of ACE alleles with AD patients appears to be independent of ApoE (1Hu J. Miyatake F. Aizu Y. Nakagawa H. Nakamura S. Tamaoka A. Takahashi R. Urakami K. Shoji M.

Here, we provide the first evidence that ACE significantly inhibits the aggregation, deposition, and cytotoxicity of Aβ in vitro by degrading Aβ-(1–40) at the site Asp7-Ser8.

The stock solution was diluted 10-fold with PBS and incubated with or without ACE at 37 °C for 4 days. Aggregation of Aβ was measured by adding 10 μl of Aβ solution into 0.5 ml of thioflavine T (ThT) solution (final concentration: 3 μm in 50 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0) and measuring the fluorescence intensity (λex at 450 nm, λem at 482 nm).

After incubation for 3 days, 10 μl of 5 mm WST-8 (2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt) containing 0.2 mm1-methoxy-5-methyl-phenazinium-methyl-sulfate, and 150 mm NaCl was added to each well, followed by another hour of incubation. The WST-8 reduction was determined colorimetrically at 450 nm using an automatic microplate spectrophotometer. Fifty microliters of the reaction mixture was injected onto a TSK gel ODS120T column (0.64 × 25 cm, particle size 5 μm) and eluted at 1 ml/min with a linear gradient of 0∼80% acetonitrile, over a period of 50 min. The peaks monitored at 210 nm were collected. Microsequencing was performed automatically by a gas-liquid sequencer (Shimadzu, model PSQ1). Phenylthiohydantoin (PTH)-derivatives were identified by Shimadzu LC system PTH-1 on a Wakopak WS-PTH column (0.64 × 25 cm, particle size: 5 μm) with isocratic elution of the PTH-derivative mobile phase. The data were analyzed by a chromatopak CR4A data processor (Shimadzu). The HPLC eluates were dissolved in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Aliquots of 0.5 μl were applied onto the MALDI target and allowed to air dry. All mass spectra were recorded with a Voyager-DE PRO mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Japan) operated in the linear or reflection mode. MALDI-MS spectra were calibrated using several peaks as external standards. Obtained spectra were analyzed using the sequest algorithm with public data bases. Somatic ACE is present in serum and seminal plasma. We measured the ACE activity in human seminal plasma (844.84 ± 344.27 units/liter (n = 139)). 2M. Kamata and J. Hu, unpublished data. In contrast, normal human serum ACE activity has been reported to be 7.60 ± 2.01 units/liter (n = 173) (14Lieberman L. Am. J. Med. 1975; 59: 365-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Because the activity in seminal plasma is over 100× higher than that in serum, we purified ACE from seminal plasma using the ACE inhibitor, lisinopril, as an affinity ligand. The purity of ACE eluted from the lisinopril-coupled Sepharose column was confirmed by electrophoregram. Purified ACE showed a single band with a molecular mass of 180 kDa using Coomassie Blue staining, and this band was strongly recognized by the anti-somatic ACE monoclonal antibody in immunoblotting (Fig.1). The purified ACE had an activity of about 20 unit/mg of protein that could be inhibited by lisinopril at a final concentration ranging from 10 to 0.01 μm in a dose response manner (Fig. 2). Synthetic Aβ in aqueous buffer tends to self-aggregate (15Hilbich C. Kisters-Woike B. Reed J. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 16Terzi E. Holzemann G. Seelig J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), and only self-aggregated Aβ exerts cytotoxicity. We detected Aβ aggregation quantitatively using fluorescence of ThT, a reagent that associates rapidly with aggregated Aβ but not with monomeric or dimeric Aβ, giving rise to a new excitation absorption at 450 nm (17Levine H. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3, 100 μm Aβ solution aggregated remarkably after incubating at 37 °C for 4 days. When Aβ solution was incubated with ACE, the aggregation was significantly inhibited, and the inhibition was dose-dependent. A concentration of 240 milliunits/100 μl ACE reduced Aβ aggregation to about 20% of the control (p = 1.7 × 10−5 versus PBS). The presence of 2.5% Me2SO in the solution did not affect Aβ aggregation (data not shown). To elucidate whether the inhibition was specific, a final concentration of 10 μm of lisinopril, which could inhibit about 98% of ACE activity (Fig. 2), was added to the ACE solution 15 min before incubation with Aβ. As shown in Fig. 3, pretreatment with the ACE inhibitor blocked 99% of the inhibitory effect of ACE (p = 0.9 versus PBS), suggesting this inhibitory effect was based on the active site of the enzyme. As a negative control, BSA at double the concentration of ACE was added to the Aβ solution, but no significant alteration was observed (p = 0.5 versus PBS). Because the process of in vitro Aβ deposition at physiological concentrations onto plaques in AD brain preparations is cumbersome, Esler et al. (18Esler W.P. Stimson E.R. Ghilardi J.R. Felix A.M. Lu Y-A. Vinters H.V. Mantyh P.W. Maggio J.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 258-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) prepared a synthaloid (synthetic template) for Aβ deposition by immobilizing fibrillar Aβ in a polymer matrix. It was demonstrated that radiolabeled Aβ deposited onto synthaloid similar to plaques in AD brain (the natural template). We used synthaloid to predict the inhibition by ACE of Aβ deposition in autopsied AD brain preparations. The amount of 125I-Aβ deposited onto the plate was 3200 cpm. Addition of 240 milliunits of ACE reduced the deposition to 1648 cpm, approximately half of the control (Fig. 4). ACE remarkably inhibited the 125I-Aβ deposition in a dose-dependent manner. Fibril formation of Aβ was investigated by electron microscopy (Fig.5). Abundant amyloid fibrils were found in the incubated Aβ solution (100 μm; containing 2.5% Me2SO). In contrast, very few fibrils were observed in the Aβ solution incubated with 240 milliunits of ACE. Compared to other rat and human cell types of neuronal origin, the rat pheochromocytoma PC12 h cell was found to be the most sensitive to Aβ (19Shearman M.S. Ragn C.I. Iversen L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1470-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). A novel cell proliferation and cytotoxicity assay method using a tetrazolium salt that produces a water-soluble formazan dye was reported. The new method was able to measure the dehydrogenase enzymes in living cells in a more convenient and sensitive way than the most currently utilized 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) methods (20Ishiyama M. Tominaga H. Shiga M. Sasamoto K. Ohkura Y. Ueno K. Watanabe M. In Vitro Toxicol. 1995; 8: 187-190Google Scholar, 21Ishiyama M. Miyazono Y. Sasamoto K. Ohkura Y. Ueno K. Talanta. 1997; 44: 1299-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). We therefore used the PC12 h cell and the new cytotoxicity assay to evaluate the inhibitory effect of ACE on Aβ cytotoxicity. As shown in Fig. 6, incubation of 10 μm aggregated Aβ with PC12 h cells for 3 days caused 53% cell death, while preincubation with 240 milliunits of ACE increased cell survival to 80 ± 5.2% (p = 0.02versus PBS). Similarly, 160 and 60 milliunits of ACE resulted in cell survival to 65 ± 0.7% (p = 0.0001 versus PBS) and 60 ± 0.2% (p = 0.008 versus PBS), respectively. The effect of ACE on PC12 h cell survival was dose-dependent and was significantversus controls. Preincubation of double the amount of BSA, instead of ACE, did not affect cell survival (50 ± 1%). On the other hand, ACE treated with 10 μm lisinopril significantly blocked the inhibitory effect of ACE on Aβ cytotoxicity, resulting in the reduction of 57 ± 2% (p = 0.005 versus ACE (240 milliunits)). These data suggest that the inhibitory effect on Aβ cytotoxicity was a specific effect by ACE. To investigate the reason ACE affected Aβ aggregation and cytotoxicity, we tried to determine if any degradation occurred during the incubation of Aβ-(1–40) with ACE and discovered a new degraded fragment using an HPLC chromatogram (Fig.7). The degraded fragment was eluted at a more hydrophobic region compared with Aβ-(1–40) (Fig. 7,A and B). Amino acid sequence analysis showed that the first ten residues of the degraded fragment (Fig. 7 A, peak b) was SGYEVHHQKL, which corresponded to Aβ-(8–17). The elution time of the degraded fragment coincided with that of the synthetic Aβ-(8–40) peptide (Fig. 7, A and C). To confirm that the degraded fragment is Aβ-(8–40), we examined the molecular weight of the synthetic Aβ-(8–40) and the degraded fragment using MALDI-TOF/MS spectroscopy. Our results for Aβ-(8–40) show 3457.78 and for the degraded peptide, 3457.98 (data not shown). These data suggest that ACE cleaved the Asp7-Ser8 linkage of Aβ-(1–40) during the incubation of Aβ with ACE. To determine the fate of another degraded fragment Aβ-(1–7), we incubated Aβ-(1–7) with ACE. The HPLC plot revealed that Aβ-(1–7) was further degraded. The Aβ-(1–7) peak (Fig. 7 D) disappeared after incubation with ACE and was replaced by three small peaks (Fig. 7 E). The three small peaks could also be detected after incubating Aβ-(1–40) with ACE (Fig.7 A). Aggregation and cytotoxic effects of the degradation products were investigated simultaneously with Aβ-(1–40). Aβ-(1–7)showed neither an aggregation nor a cytotoxic effect. Aβ-(8–40) gave an aggregation effect of 35.7%, which was significantly lower than that of Aβ-(1–40). The level of aggregation of Aβ-(8–40) incubated with Aβ-(1–7) was not significantly different from that of Aβ-(8–40) alone (Fig. 8). As shown in Fig. 9, PC12 h cells incubated with Aβ-(8–40) for 3 days exhibited a reduced survival to 77 ± 3%, which was significantly higher than that seen with Aβ-(1–40) (p = 0.004versus PBS).Figure 9Cytotoxicity of Aβ degradation products. Ten microliters of synthetic Aβ-(1–40) or Aβ-(8–40) or Aβ-(1–7) solution was added to 104 PC12 h cells as described in the legend to Fig. 6. After 3 days, the living cells were detected with the cell count kit. The values are the means ± S.D.

Lesueur-Ginot L. Cohen D. Nat. Genet. 1994; 6: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar) reported that ACE polymorphism was associated with human longevity and that the ACE DD genotype was surprisingly increased in centenarians. Therefore, Kehoe et al. (8Kehoe P.G. Russ C. Mcllroy S. Williams H. Holmans P. Holmes C. Liolitsa D. Vahidassr D. Powell J. McGleenon B. Liddell M. Plomin R. Dynan K. Williams N. Neal J. Cairns N.J. Wilcock G. Passmore P. Lovestone S. Williams J. Owen M.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 71-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) hypothesized that the D allele might protect against the development of AD and actually confirmed the hypothesis in British populations. We have reported that the ACE genotype is associated with AD in Japanese population even more significantly than that in the British population reported by Kehoe et al. (1Hu J. Miyatake F. Aizu Y. Nakagawa H. Nakamura S. Tamaoka A. Takahashi R. Urakami K. Shoji M. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 277: 65-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recently, a gender-specific association of the ACE genotype with AD in the female clinic population was reported (10Crawford F. Abdullah L. Schinka J. Suo Z. Gold M. Duara R. Mullan M. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 280: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It was also reported that ApoE and ACE genotypes might be independent risk factors for late-onset AD in both Russian and North American populations (11Farrer L.A. Sherbatich T. Keryanov S.A. Korovaitseva G.I. Rogaeva E.A. Petruk S. Premkumar S. Moliaka Y. Song Y.Q. Pei Y. Sato C. Selezneva N.D. Voskresenskaya S. Golimbet V. Sorbi S. Duara R. Gavrilova S. St. George-Hyslop P.H. Rogaev E.I. Arch. Neurol. 2000; 57: 210-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although several clinical, epidemiological, and pathological observations suggested that vascular risk factors might be associated with cognitive performances of AD, the mechanism by which the ACE genotypes influenced susceptibility to AD was unknown. The recent studies on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) of the mammalian brain may explain the association between ACE and AD in a certain sense. Besides the classical RAS, a local RAS in the brain may play a critical role in the central nervous system. It has been reported that angiotensin in astrocytes is required for the functional maintenance of the blood brain barrier (23Kakinuma Y. Hama H. Sugiyama F. Yagami K. Goto K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1078-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), which is impaired in AD (24Skoog I. Wallin A. Fredman P. Neurology. 1998; 50: 966-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Central RAS prevents neuronal cells from apoptosis not only by AngII but also by AngIV, an AngII metabolite (25Kakinuma Y. Hama H. Sugiyama F. Goto K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 232: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Both AngII and AngIV excite hippocampal neuronal activity (26Albrecht D. Broser M. Kruger H. Regul. Pept. 1997; 70: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and regulate cerebral blood flow (27Kramar E.A. Harding J.W. Wright J.W. Regul. Pept. 1997; 68: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Colocalization of ACE and AngI receptor in the substantia nigra, the caudate nucleus, and putamen of human and rat suggests central RAS may be important in modulating central dopamine release. In Parkinson's disease, there is a marked reduction of ACE receptors associated with the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuron loss, and ACE inhibitor modifies the clinical features of Parkinson's disease (28Zhuo J. Moeller I. Jenkins T. Chai S.Y. Allen A.M. Ohishi M. Mendelsohn F.A. J. Hypertens. 1998; 16: 2027-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The striking distribution of AngIV receptors in cholinergic neurons, motor, and sensory nuclei of the brain suggest that AngIV plays an important role in the facilitation of learning and memory (29Reardon K.A. Mendelsohn F.A. Chai S.Y. Horne M.K. Aust. N Z. J. Med. 2000; 30: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 30Wright J.W. Stubley L. Pederson E.S Kramar E.A. Hanesworth J.M. Harding J.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3952-3961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Pederson E.S. Harding J.W. Wright J.W. Regul. Pept. 1998; 74: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrate that angiotensin is essential not only to the circulatory system, but also to the central nervous system. Although these results are helpful in understanding the relationship between AD and ACE, they do not provide direct evidence. AD is a heterogeneous disorder with a variety of molecular pathologies converging predominantly on abnormal amyloid deposition particularly in the brain. Aβ aggregation into senile plaques is an important pathological hallmark of AD. We hypothesize that ACE may affect Aβ aggregation and deposition in the brain. We have substantiated the hypothesis and elucidate here that ACE inhibits Aβ aggregation, deposition, fibril formation, and cytotoxicity in vitro. These results provide the first evidence of direct involvement of ACE with AD susceptibility. Several lines of evidence have shown that amorphous, largely nonfilamentous deposits of Aβ (so called “diffuse” or preamyloid plaques) precede the development of fibrillar amyloid, dystrophic neurites, neurofibrillary tangles, and other cytopathological changes in Down’s syndrome and AD. In the AD brain, diffuse plaques composed mostly of amorphous Aβ are inert, whereas compact plaques composed of Aβ fibrils are associated with neurodegenerative changes (32Selkoe D.J. Yamazaki T. Citron M. Podlisny M.B. Koo E.H. Teplow D.B. Haass C. Ann. New York Acad. Sci. 1996; 777: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 33Lorenzo A. Yankner B.A. Ann. New York Acad. Sci. 1996; 777: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar).In vitro experiments also reveal that the neurotoxicity of Aβ is associated with their ability to form stable aggregates in aqueous solution (34Yanker B.A. Neurobiol. Aging. 1992; 13: 615-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 35Pike C.J. Burdick D. Walencewicz A.J. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1676-1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Pike C.J. Walencewicz A.J. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. Brain Res. 1991; 563: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). The aggregation of Aβ only is not sufficient to exert neurotoxicity effect, but further amyloid fibril formation is required (37Lorenzo A. Yankner B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12243-12247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). Aggregation of Aβ is template-independent initial nidus formation, and deposition of Aβ is template-dependent subsequent to plaque growth. These are considered fundamentally distinct biochemical processes in AD (38Esler W.P. Stimson E.R. Ghilardi J.P. Vinters H.V. Lee J.P. Mantyh P.W. Maggio J.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that aggregation, deposition, and fibril formation are the necessary processes for Aβ to achieve and strengthen a neurotoxic state. Just in these critical processes, ACE plays an important role in decrease of Aβ neurotoxicity, suggesting the possible cause of ACE genotype in affecting susceptibility to AD. Three types of proteases, which are designated α-, β-, and γ-secretases, cleave APP. Processing by α-secretase cleaves within the Aβ sequence whereas β- and γ-secretase cleaves on the N- and C-terminal ends of the Aβ region, respectively, releasing Aβ (39Mills J. Reiner P.B. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 443-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). γ-Secretase cleaves at several adjacent sites to yield Aβ species containing 39–43 amino acid residues. Because α-secretase destroys the Aβ sequence, it is generally thought that α-secretase pathway mitigates amyloid formation, although this has not yet been demonstrated unequivocally (40Nunan J. Small D.H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 483: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). In addition, the C-terminally truncated form of APP released by α-secretase may have trophic actions (41Small D.H. Neurochem. Res. 1998; 23: 795-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which could antagonize the neurotoxic effects of aggregated Aβ (42Mok S.S. Clippingdale A.B. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Barrow C.J. Small D.H. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 61: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). ACE acts like the α-secretase in degrading Aβ and thus preventing aggregation. Several Aβ-degrading enzymes were studied because of their potential usage in AD treatment. BACE can cleave full-length APP at Asp1 of the Aβ sequence and also at Glu11(42Mok S.S. Clippingdale A.B. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Barrow C.J. Small D.H. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 61: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Recently, Chesneau et al. (43Chesneau V. Vekrellis K. Rosner M.R. Selkoe D.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) reported that insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is sufficient to degrade Aβ and that its degradation products do not promote oligomerization of the intact Aβ peptide (43Chesneau V. Vekrellis K. Rosner M.R. Selkoe D.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Iwata et al. (44Iwata N. Tsubuki S. Takaki Y. Watanabe K. Sekiguchi M. Hosoki E.

Med. 2000; 6: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) reported that endopeptidase 24.11 (neprylisin) is involved selectively in the catabolism of Aβ-(1–42) in rat brain parenchyma. Yu et al. (45Yu G.S.P. Hu J. Nakagawa H. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 254: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) reported that midkine formed complexes with Aβ-(1–40) and protected PC12 h from Aβ-induced cytotoxicity. In the present study, we report that ACE is a new Aβ-degrading enzyme that cleaves the Aβ sequence at Asp7-Ser8. The cleavage site is different from the site that converts AngI to AngII, or other Aβ-cleaving sites reported as yet. Although the actual meaning of a real Aβ-degrading function of ACE in vivo remains to be further studied, our data strongly lead to the hypothesis that ACE may affect susceptibility to AD by degrading Aβ and preventing the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brains of AD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2019438547,"Long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity like the late phase of LTP (L-LTP) typically require an elevation of cAMP, the recruitment of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), and ultimately the activation of transcription and translation; some forms also require brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Both cAMP and BDNF can activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK/ERK), which also plays a role in LTP. However, little is known about the mechanisms whereby cAMP, BDNF, and MAPK interact. We find that increases in cAMP can rapidly activate the BDNF receptor TrkB and induce BDNF-dependent long-lasting potentiation at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse in hippocampus. Surprisingly, in these BDNF-dependent forms of potentiation, which are also MAPK dependent, TrkB activation is not critical for the activation of MAPK but instead appears to modulate the subcellular distribution and nuclear translocation of the activated MAPK."
https://openalex.org/W2126268397,"Several fMRI studies have reported MT+ response increases correlated with perception of the motion aftereffect (MAE). However, attention can strongly affect MT+ responses, and subjects may naturally attend more to the MAE than control trials without MAE. We found that requiring subjects to attend to motion on both MAE and control trials produced equal levels of MT+ response, suggesting that attention may have confounded the interpretation of previous experiments; in our data, attention accounts for the entire effect. After eliminating this confound, we observed that direction-selective motion adaptation produced a direction-selective imbalance in MT+ responses (and earlier visual areas), and yielded a corresponding asymmetry in speed discrimination thresholds. These findings provide physiological evidence that population level response imbalances underlie the MAE, and quantify the relative proportions of direction-selective neurons across human visual areas."

The μ- and m-calpains consist of a μ- or m-80-kDa large subunit (genes Capn 1 and Capn 2), and a common 28-kDa small subunit (Capn 4). To assess the role of calpain in migration, we used fibroblasts obtained fromCapn 4−/− mouse embryos. The cells lacked calpain activity on casein zymography and did not generate the characteristic calpain-generated spectrin breakdown product that is observed in wild-type cells.

However, the physiological functions of calpain and relevant substrates in vivo remain poorly understood. This is partly because of the lack of specificity of many commonly used calpain inhibitors (6Mellgren R.L. Zhang W. Lu Q. Lane R.D. Wang K.K.W. Yuen P.W. Calpain: Pharmacology and Toxicology of Calcium-dependent Protease. Taylor & Francis, Philadelphia1999: 161-178Google Scholar). In this study, the role of calpain during migration has been examined usingCapn 4−/− embryonic fibroblasts. These cells represent a powerful tool to help define unambiguously the role of calpain in a variety of cellular processes while avoiding the use of calpain inhibitors.The calpains (μ- and m-) consist of a μ- or m-80-kDa large subunit (genes Capn 1 and Capn 2) and a common 28-kDa small subunit (Capn 4). It has been shown thatCapn 4+/− mice are phenotypically normal but that homozygous Capn 4−/− embryos die at ∼10 days post-conception (19Arthur J.S.C. Elce J.S. Hegadorn C. Williams K. Greer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4474-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The Capn 4−/−embryos displayed a defect in vascular development, suggesting a role for calpain in endothelial cell proliferation, survival, and/or migration. Interestingly, although no μ- or m-calpain activity is detectable by casein zymography in Capn 4−/− ES cells and embryonic fibroblasts, these cells grow normally. The work described here therefore does not distinguish between the contribution of the two calpain isoforms to the observed phenotype. Interestingly, disruption of the Capn 1 gene and loss of μ-calpain had no major effects in the mouse, although some disturbance of platelet function has been observed (20Beckerle M.C. Burridge K. DeMartino G.N. Croall D.E. Cell. 1987; 51: 569-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar).Following the earlier report that calpain was localized to focal adhesions (21Azam M.

Biol. 2001; 21: 2213-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), recent work has increasingly supported a role for calpain in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, cell spreading, and migration. Calpain has also been localized to integrin clusters and appears to cleave many focal adhesion proteins, including β3-integrin, focal adhesion kinase (FAK),1 and talin (22Carragher N.O. Levkau B.

Calpain may also modulate cell spreading and migration by regulating the activities of signaling molecules, including not only FAK but also protein kinase C and the Rho family of GTPases. However, the exact role for calpain in migration is unclear. Some studies have described an inhibition of cell spreading and protrusion after calpain inhibition (2Potter D.A. Tirnauer J.S. Janssen R.

Palecek S.P. Lu Q. Zhang W. Mellgren R.L. Lauffenburger D.A. Ginsberg M.H. Horwitz A.F. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar).To assess the role of calpain during cell migration, we performed time lapse videomicroscopy, immunostaining of focal adhesions, and immunodetection of several focal adhesion components inCapn 4+/+ and Capn 4−/−embryonic fibroblasts. The changes in phenotype observed in theCapn 4−/− cells were partially restored to the wild-type phenotype by transfection ofCapn 4−/− cells with a vector expressing the rat calpain small subunit. The results establish that calpain is essential for cytoskeletal regulation during migration.DISCUSSIONThese studies demonstrate unequivocally that calpain plays a critical role during cell migration and in regulating the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Capn 4−/− cells showed reduced migration speeds and a loss of central focal adhesions and stress fibers. The effects on cell morphology and the organization of the actin cytoskeleton were rescued in a cell line that expressed the rat 28-kDa small subunit, directly implicating calpain in the observed effects. Interestingly, the restoration of calpain activity in the Capn 4−/− cell line was found to be difficult, and the isolated cell line expressed only relatively low levels of m-calpain activity, suggesting that expression of the regulatory subunit does not confer a survival advantage. Together, the findings clearly support the critical importance of calpain as a regulator of the actin cytoskeleton and cell migration.The Capn 4−/− cells were less spread thanCapn 4+/+ cells, with a loss of central focal adhesions and stress fibers. This is consistent with previous reports using calpain inhibitors and suggests that normal cell spreading is a calpain-dependent process (2Potter D.A. Tirnauer J.S. Janssen R. Croall D.E. Hughes C.N. Fiacco K.A. Mier J.W. Maki M. Herman I.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 3Kulkarni S. Saido T.C. Suzuki K. Fox J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21265-21275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In contrast to these previous reports, however, the Capn 4−/− cells were more protrusive and polarized than Capn 4+/+cells at specific fibronectin concentrations.Capn 4−/− cells plated on low concentrations of fibronectin showed prominent filopodia with thin projections and prominent retraction fibers in comparison to control cells. Our recent studies have demonstrated that small changes in ligand density may have dramatic effects on signaling via the Rho family of GTPases (35Cox E. Sastry S. Huttenlocher A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 12: 265-277Crossref Scopus (247) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that calpain may be affecting cell morphology and migration in a ligand density-dependent manner by modulating the activity of the Rho family of GTPases. A recent report (3Kulkarni S. Saido T.C. Suzuki K. Fox J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21265-21275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) in fact has shown that calpain can act upstream of Rho and Rac to regulate their activity, which is consistent with our results.Under conditions in which Capn 4+/+ cells migrated maximally, the Capn 4−/− cells had prominent membrane projections, and it appeared that delayed retraction and detachment contributed to the reduced migration rates. These findings confirm previous reports suggesting that calpain is an important mediator of cell detachment during migration (1Huttenlocher A. Palecek S.P. Lu Q. Zhang W. Mellgren R.L. Lauffenburger D.A. Ginsberg M.H. Horwitz A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32719-32722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 40Palecek S.P. Huttenlocher A. Horwitz A.F.

The mechanism of the detachment defect is not clear but may result from the decrease in Rho-mediated contractility or a reduction in focal adhesion disassembly at the rear of the cell. The peripheral distribution of focal complexes observed after calpain inhibition (1Huttenlocher A. Palecek S.P. Lu Q. Zhang W. Mellgren R.L. Lauffenburger D.A. Ginsberg M.H. Horwitz A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32719-32722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) and in theCapn 4−/− cells suggests that calpain may play a role in focal complex disassembly. A recent study (22Carragher N.O. Levkau B. Ross R. Raines E.W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) supports this possibility by demonstrating that collagen fragments promoted focal complex disassembly in a calpain-dependent manner. Thus, it seems likely that calpain activity could be implicated in the disassembly of focal adhesions during cell migration via the cleavage of one or more focal adhesion components. Among these, many proteins such as α-actinin, FAK, spectrin, talin, and vinculin have been proposed as calpain substrates (21Azam M. Andrabi S.S. Sahr K.E. Kamath L. Kuliopulos A. Chishti A.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2213-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 22Carragher N.O. Levkau B. Ross R. Raines E.W. J.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Our results showed that spectrin and talin were cleaved in Capn 4+/+cells but not in Capn 4−/− cells and that α-actinin and vinculin were not cleaved in either cell type when plated on fibronectin. Furthermore, the levels of expression of all of these proteins were similar in Capn 4+/+ and Capn 4−/− cells. Recently, calpain-dependent proteolysis of FAK has been shown to accompany v-Src-dependent focal adhesion disassembly (25Carragher N.O. Fincham V.J. Riley D. Frame M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4270-4275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), but in our work (using the same antibody as Carragher and co-workers (25Carragher N.O. Fincham V.J. Riley D. Frame M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4270-4275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar)), the level and digestion profile of FAK remained unchanged in Capn 4+/+ and Capn 4−/− cells. This result indicates that calpain-dependent degradation of FAK may not be required for migration of embryonic fibroblasts under the conditions of our experiments. The possible connections between phosphorylation of some of these potential calpain substrates and the role of calpain in regulating these molecules will be investigated further in theCapn 4−/− cells.The cytoskeletal protein talin, a well characterized calpain substrate, has been shown to co-localize with the enzyme at adhesion plaques (21Azam M. Andrabi S.S. Sahr K.E. Kamath L. Kuliopulos A. Chishti A.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2213-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Talin was found to be essential in focal adhesion assembly in ES cells but not in some differentiated cells derived from them (45Priddle H. Hemmings L. Monkley S. Woods A. Patel B. Sutton D. Dunn G.A. Zicha D. Critchley D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1121-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Moreover, calpain cleaves talin at an interdomain region in vitro producing an N-terminal proteolytic fragment of 47 kDa and a C-terminal fragment of 190–200 kDa (21Azam M. Andrabi S.S. Sahr K.E. Kamath L. Kuliopulos A. Chishti A.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2213-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 42O'Halloran T. Beckerle M.C Burridge K. Nature. 1985; 317: 449-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 43Rees D.J. Ades S.E. Singer S.J. Hynes R.O. Nature. 1990; 347: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 44Yamaguchi R. Maki M. Hatanaka M. Sabe H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that limited proteolysis of talin occurs within focal adhesions of Chinese hamster ovary cells, although no evidence of a role for calpain was presented (46Tranqui L. Block M.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Immunodetection of talin in extracts ofCapn 4+/+ fibroblasts showed the formation of a proteolytic fragment (200 kDa) of talin, which was not detected inCapn 4−/− cells. Moreover the restoration of talin cleavage in the Capn 4−/− cells after reintroduction of the calpain 28-kDa subunit clearly demonstrates that talin breakdown is due to calpain activity. These findings suggest that calpain may be responsible for the cleavage of talin within the adhesion plaques and for their disassembly. Because talin is known to interact directly with the cytoplasmic domain of the β-chain of the integrin receptors (47Horwitz A. Duggan K. Buck C. Beckerle M.C. Burridge K. Nature. 1986; 320: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 48Otey C.A. Pavalko F.M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar) and also with actin filaments (49Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 987-1035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Wilkins J.A. Risinger M.A. Lin S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1483-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 51Muguruma M. Matsumura S. Fukazawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 1217-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that the absence of cleavage of this cytoskeletal protein could be at least in part responsible for the abnormal organization of the actin cytoskeleton and for the reduced migration observed in Capn 4−/− cells.Many questions remain unanswered about how calpain regulates cell migration and the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Although our results suggest that talin proteolysis by calpain is required for normal cell migration, it is likely that calpain cleaves other substrates within the focal complex. A challenge for the future will be to identify these substrates and to understand more about how calpain modulates the cytoskeleton and cell migration. TheCapn 4−/− cells represent an important tool for the investigation of these questions. Together, our results show that one biological role for calpain is to mediate cell migration by regulating the actin cytoskeleton, cell polarity, and detachment. Calpains have been implicated in a large number of physiological processes including cell spreading and migration (1Huttenlocher A. Palecek S.P. Lu Q. Zhang W. Mellgren R.L. Lauffenburger D.A.

To assess the role of calpain during cell migration, we performed time lapse videomicroscopy, immunostaining of focal adhesions, and immunodetection of several focal adhesion components inCapn 4+/+ and Capn 4−/−embryonic fibroblasts. The changes in phenotype observed in theCapn 4−/− cells were partially restored to the wild-type phenotype by transfection ofCapn 4−/− cells with a vector expressing the rat calpain small subunit. The results establish that calpain is essential for cytoskeletal regulation during migration. DISCUSSIONThese studies demonstrate unequivocally that calpain plays a critical role during cell migration and in regulating the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Capn 4−/− cells showed reduced migration speeds and a loss of central focal adhesions and stress fibers. The effects on cell morphology and the organization of the actin cytoskeleton were rescued in a cell line that expressed the rat 28-kDa small subunit, directly implicating calpain in the observed effects. Interestingly, the restoration of calpain activity in the Capn 4−/− cell line was found to be difficult, and the isolated cell line expressed only relatively low levels of m-calpain activity, suggesting that expression of the regulatory subunit does not confer a survival advantage. Together, the findings clearly support the critical importance of calpain as a regulator of the actin cytoskeleton and cell migration.The Capn 4−/− cells were less spread thanCapn 4+/+ cells, with a loss of central focal adhesions and stress fibers. This is consistent with previous reports using calpain inhibitors and suggests that normal cell spreading is a calpain-dependent process (2Potter D.A. Tirnauer J.S. Janssen R. Croall D.E. Hughes C.N.

In contrast to these previous reports, however, the Capn 4−/− cells were more protrusive and polarized than Capn 4+/+cells at specific fibronectin concentrations.Capn 4−/− cells plated on low concentrations of fibronectin showed prominent filopodia with thin projections and prominent retraction fibers in comparison to control cells. Our recent studies have demonstrated that small changes in ligand density may have dramatic effects on signaling via the Rho family of GTPases (35Cox E. Sastry S. Huttenlocher A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 12: 265-277Crossref Scopus (247) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that calpain may be affecting cell morphology and migration in a ligand density-dependent manner by modulating the activity of the Rho family of GTPases.

Chem. 1999; 274: 21265-21275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) in fact has shown that calpain can act upstream of Rho and Rac to regulate their activity, which is consistent with our results.Under conditions in which Capn 4+/+ cells migrated maximally, the Capn 4−/− cells had prominent membrane projections, and it appeared that delayed retraction and detachment contributed to the reduced migration rates. These findings confirm previous reports suggesting that calpain is an important mediator of cell detachment during migration (1Huttenlocher A. Palecek S.P. Lu Q. Zhang W. Mellgren R.L.

A recent study (22Carragher N.O. Levkau B. Ross R. Raines E.W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) supports this possibility by demonstrating that collagen fragments promoted focal complex disassembly in a calpain-dependent manner. Thus, it seems likely that calpain activity could be implicated in the disassembly of focal adhesions during cell migration via the cleavage of one or more focal adhesion components. Among these, many proteins such as α-actinin, FAK, spectrin, talin, and vinculin have been proposed as calpain substrates (21Azam M. Andrabi S.S. Sahr K.E. Kamath L. Kuliopulos A. Chishti A.H. Mol.

Furthermore, the levels of expression of all of these proteins were similar in Capn 4+/+ and Capn 4−/− cells. Recently, calpain-dependent proteolysis of FAK has been shown to accompany v-Src-dependent focal adhesion disassembly (25Carragher N.O. Fincham V.J. Riley D. Frame M.C. J. Biol.

This result indicates that calpain-dependent degradation of FAK may not be required for migration of embryonic fibroblasts under the conditions of our experiments. The possible connections between phosphorylation of some of these potential calpain substrates and the role of calpain in regulating these molecules will be investigated further in theCapn 4−/− cells.The cytoskeletal protein talin, a well characterized calpain substrate, has been shown to co-localize with the enzyme at adhesion plaques (21Azam M.

Moreover, calpain cleaves talin at an interdomain region in vitro producing an N-terminal proteolytic fragment of 47 kDa and a C-terminal fragment of 190–200 kDa (21Azam M. Andrabi S.S. Sahr K.E.

Immunodetection of talin in extracts ofCapn 4+/+ fibroblasts showed the formation of a proteolytic fragment (200 kDa) of talin, which was not detected inCapn 4−/− cells. Moreover the restoration of talin cleavage in the Capn 4−/− cells after reintroduction of the calpain 28-kDa subunit clearly demonstrates that talin breakdown is due to calpain activity. These findings suggest that calpain may be responsible for the cleavage of talin within the adhesion plaques and for their disassembly. Because talin is known to interact directly with the cytoplasmic domain of the β-chain of the integrin receptors (47Horwitz A. Duggan K. Buck C. Beckerle M.C. Burridge K.

Although our results suggest that talin proteolysis by calpain is required for normal cell migration, it is likely that calpain cleaves other substrates within the focal complex.

https://openalex.org/W1974646226,"Disruption of the presynaptically enriched polyphosphoinositide phosphatase synaptojanin 1 leads to an increase of clathrin-coated intermediates and of polymerized actin at endocytic zones of nerve terminals. These changes correlate with elevated levels of PI(4,5)P(2) in neurons. We report that phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase type Igamma (PIPKIgamma), a major brain PI(4)P 5-kinase, is concentrated at synapses. Synaptojanin 1 and PIPKIgamma antagonize each other in the recruitment of clathrin coats to lipid membranes. Like synaptojanin 1 and other proteins involved in endocytosis, PIPKIgamma undergoes stimulation-dependent dephosphorylation. These results implicate PIPKIgamma in the synthesis of a PI(4,5)P(2) pool that acts as a positive regulator of clathrin coat recruitment and actin function at the synapse."
https://openalex.org/W2157791921,"One of the brain's fundamental tasks is to construct and transform representations of an animal's environment, yet few studies describe how individual neurons accomplish this. Our results from correlated pairs in the auditory thalamocortical system show that cortical excitatory receptive field regions can be directly inherited from thalamus, constructed from smaller inputs, and assembled by the cooperative activity of neuronal ensembles. The prevalence of functional thalamocortical connectivity is strictly governed by tonotopy, but connection strength is not. Finally, spectral and temporal modulation preferences in cortex may differ dramatically from the thalamic input. Our observations reveal a radical reconstruction of response properties from auditory thalamus to cortex, and illustrate how some properties are propagated with great fidelity while others are significantly transformed or generated intracortically."
https://openalex.org/W2075593832,"Agonistic antibodies against the Fas receptor, when administered to mice in vivo, cause significant apoptosis in the liver. In this study we show that anti-Fas antibody not only causes apoptosis of liver cells but also provokes hepatic inflammation. Two hours after injection of anti-Fas, when mice displayed evidence of caspase-3 activation and apoptosis, we found significant hepatic induction of the CXC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein-2 and KC. Coincident with the chemokine induction was infiltration of the hepatic parenchyma by neutrophils. Neutralization experiments identified that chemokines were the cause of Fas-induced hepatic inflammation, with KC having the predominant effect. Chemokine induction in the livers of anti-Fas-treated mice was not associated with activation of NF-κB. Instead, it coincided with nuclear translocation of activator protein-1 (AP-1). AP-1 activation in liver was detected 1–2 h after anti-Fas treatment, suggesting a connection to the onset of apoptosis. When apoptosis was prevented by pretreating mice with a caspase-3 inhibitor, AP-1 activation and hepatic chemokine production were both significantly reduced. Hepatic inflammation was also reduced by 70%. Taken together, these findings indicate that Fas ligation can induce inflammation in the liverin vivo. Inflammation does not arise from Fas-mediated signaling through NF-κB; rather, it represents an indirect effect, requiring activation of caspase-3 and nuclear translocation of AP-1."
https://openalex.org/W2098743384,"Robo receptors interact with ligands of the Slit family. The nematode C. elegans has one Robo receptor (SAX-3) and one Slit protein (SLT-1), which direct ventral axon guidance and guidance at the midline. In larvae, slt-1 expression in dorsal muscles repels axons to promote ventral guidance. SLT-1 acts through the SAX-3 receptor, in parallel with the ventral attractant UNC-6 (Netrin). Removing both UNC-6 and SLT-1 eliminates all ventral guidance information for some axons, revealing an underlying longitudinal guidance pathway. In the embryo, slt-1 is expressed at high levels in anterior epidermis. Embryonic expression of SLT-1 provides anterior-posterior guidance information to migrating CAN neurons. Surprisingly, slt-1 mutants do not exhibit the nerve ring and epithelial defects of sax-3 mutants, suggesting that SAX-3 has both Slit-dependent and Slit-independent functions in development."
https://openalex.org/W1972404682,"Plexins are neuronal receptors for the repulsive axon guidance molecule Semaphorins. Previous studies showed that Plexin B (PlexB) binds directly to the active, GTP-bound form of the Rac GTPase. Here, we define a seven amino acid sequence in PlexB required for Rac(GTP) binding. The interaction of PlexB with Rac(GTP) is necessary for Plexin-mediated axon guidance in vivo. A different region of PlexB binds to RhoA. Dosage-sensitive genetic interactions suggest that PlexB suppresses Rac activity and enhances RhoA activity. Biochemical evidence indicates that PlexB sequesters Rac(GTP) from its downstream effector PAK. These results suggest a model whereby PlexB mediates repulsion by coordinately regulating two small GTPases in opposite directions: PlexB binds to Rac(GTP) and downregulates its output by blocking its access to PAK and, at the same time, binds to and increases the output of RhoA."
https://openalex.org/W1578257252,"The production of nitric oxide by macrophages has been implicated as a host defense mechanism against microbial pathogens and tumor cells. Recent reports have implicated interferon-α/β (IFN-α/β) as an autocrine/paracrine signal critical for the induction of murine iNOS. In this report we have systematically investigated the role of IFN-β in the induction of iNOS in the murine macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7. First, we demonstrate that IFN-β expression is highly up-regulated, and is secreted in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Treatment of RAW macrophages with LPS results in a time-dependent phosphorylation of STAT-1 on both tyrosine residue 701 (Tyr-701) and serine residue 727 (Ser-727) that is consistent with the timing of endogenous IFN-β expression. LPS also induces interferon regulatory factor-1 expression with similar kinetics. We further demonstrate that exogenous IFN-β accelerates the induction of iNOS by LPS. The acceleration of iNOS induction is observed at the levels of transcription, protein expression, and NO formation. Accordingly, we propose that the cytokine environment of macrophages may determine the rate and magnitude of nitric oxide production, thereby regulating the cytotoxic response to pathogen challenge.

Accordingly, we propose that the cytokine environment of macrophages may determine the rate and magnitude of nitric oxide production, thereby regulating the cytotoxic response to pathogen challenge. nitric oxide inducible nitric-oxide synthase lipopolysaccharide, IFN, interferon Janus kinase signal transducer and activator of transcription interferon regulatory factor-1 reverse transcriptase ribonuclease protection assay glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase Activated macrophages produce nitric oxide (NO),1 a free radical species that mediates cytotoxic and cytostatic effects against pathogenic microbes and tumor cells (1Hibbs Jr., J.B.

Med. 1989; 169: 1011-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The enzyme responsible for the production of NO by macrophages is the inducible isoform of nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), which catalyzes the oxidation of one of the equivalent guanidino nitrogens of arginine to form NO and citrulline (4Stuehr D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 324-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Compared with the neuronal and endothelial isoforms of NOS (nNOS and eNOS, respectively), iNOS generates high concentrations of NO, which accounts for the cytotoxic and cytostatic effects of NO on target cells (5Xie Q. Nathan C. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1994; 56: 576-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The regulation of NO production by iNOS has been extensively studied in murine macrophages, and occurs primarily at the level of transcription. The gene encoding iNOS is transcriptionally silent, but is dramatically induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS activates Toll-like receptor-dependent signaling pathways in macrophages, including the transcription factor, NF-κB (6Anderson K.V. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). However, maximal induction is not achieved by LPS alone. The induction of iNOS by LPS can be synergized by the addition of specific cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) (7Ganster R.W. Geller D.A. Ignarro L.J. Nitric Oxide: Biology and Pathobiology. Academic Press, San Diego2000: 129-156Crossref Google Scholar). This synergy is reflected in the promoter region of the murine iNOS gene, which contains oligonucleotide motifs for the binding of both LPS- and several cytokine-induced transcription factors (8Lowenstein C.J. Alley E.W. Raval P. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Russell S.W. Murphy W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9730-9734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Both type I (IFN-α/β) and type II (IFN-γ) interferons mediate the induction of target genes via the activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway (9Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins are a family of transcriptional activators that interact with IFN receptors and associated Janus kinase (JAK) proteins. The activation of STAT proteins is regulated by phosphorylation, which occurs in response to ligand-induced dimerization of IFN receptors, and the consequential activation of associated protein kinases. It has been reported that phosphorylation of the transcription factor, STAT-1 mediates the synergy between the IFN- and LPS-induced pathways in the induction of iNOS in murine macrophages (10Kovarik P. Stoiber D. Novy M. Decker T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3660-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it has been proposed that murine macrophages secrete IFN-α/β in response to stimulation with LPS, and that these IFNs have an autocrine/paracrine function preceding the induction iNOS (11Gessani S. Belardelli F. Pecorelli A. Puddu P. Baglioni C. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 2785-2789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Fujihara M. Ito N. Pace J.L. Watanabe Y. Russell S.W. Suzuki T. J. Biol.

More recently, it was shown that murine macrophages lacking the IFNAR1 component of the IFN-β receptor do not express iNOS protein in response to LPS alone, thereby implicating IFN-β as a critical element in the processes leading to LPS-stimulated NO production (14Vadiveloo P.K. Vairo G. Hertzog P. Kola I. Hamilton J.A. Cytokine. 2000; 12: 1639-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). IRF proteins also mediate the transcriptional responses to IFN stimulation. IRF-1 and IRF-2 have opposing roles in cellular responses to IFNs. IRF-1 acts as a transcriptional activator, whereas IRF-2 represses transcription in a competitive fashion by occupying the same DNA-binding site as IRF-1 (15Harada H. Fujita T. Miyamoto M. Kimura Y. Maruyama M. Furia A. Miyata T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1989; 58: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 16Tanaka N. Kawakami T. Taniguchi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4531-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Typically, IRF-1 is not expressed or is undetectable. However, IRF-1 can be induced by a variety of stimuli, including IFN-β (17Fujita T. Reis L.F. Watanabe N. Kimura Y. Taniguchi T. Vilcek J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9936-9940Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Both the expression of IRF-1, and the presence of a crucial IRF-1-binding site within the promoter of theiNOS gene are necessary for the induction of iNOS in murine macrophages (18Kamijo R. Harada H. Matsuyama T. Bosland M. Gerecitano J. Shapiro D. Le J. Koh S.I. Kimura T. Green S.J. Mak T.W. Taniguchi T. Vilcek J. Science. 1994; 263: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 19Martin E. Nathan C. Xie Q.W. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). IRF-2 is constitutive in many cell types, but the regulation of its expression and its role in regulating iNOS in murine macrophages is less well defined. In this report we systematically examine the events leading to the induction of iNOS in LPS-treated RAW macrophages. The LPS-induced expression of IFN-β is correlated with the activation of STAT and IRF proteins, transcription of the iNOS gene, iNOS protein levels, and finally, to the generation of NO. In doing this we have evaluated the role of IFN-β as an autocrine/paracrine mediator and provide both support and new insight into the existing model. RAW 264.7 macrophages (obtained from ATCC) were cultured in 10-cm dishes containing Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Mediatech) supplemented with 50 mm HEPES, 4 mml-glutamine, 1.2 mml-arginine, 10 IU/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, 250 ng/ml amphotericin B, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were grown to confluence, then split using 0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mm EDTA and plated at a density of 3 × 106 cells/dish. Viability was assayed using trypan blue dye exclusion, and was typically greater than 95%. Cultures were maintained until passage 20, and then discarded. LPS (Escherishia coli serotype 0128:B12, Sigma) was suspended in sterile water and added to obtain the desired concentration. Recombinant murine IFN-β was obtained from Research Diagnostics, Inc., and rabbit anti-mouse IFN-β polyclonal antibody was obtained from PBL Biomedical Laboratories. Following treatment with experimental agents, cells were harvested using a cell scraper and collected by centrifugation. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) and quantified by absorbance at 260 nm. 15 μg of RNA was dried in a Speed-Vac (Savant) and stored at −80 °C. Radiolabeled antisense RNA was synthesized using the Riboprobe transcription kit (Promega) and [α-32P]CTP, 800 Ci/mmol (ICN). Templates for antisense RNA for murine iNOS and IFN-γ were purchased from Ambion. The template for murine GAPDH was purchased from Pharmingen. The template for murine IFN-β was generated by RT-PCR cloning. Briefly, RNA from RAW macrophages stimulated with LPS for 3 h was reverse transcribed using the Superscript preamplification system (Life Technologies, Inc.), then subjected to 30 rounds of PCR using Ready-To-Go PCR beads (Amersham Bioscience, Inc.). The primers used for PCR were designed to amplify a 312-nucleotide sequence within the IFN-β coding region (forward primer: 5′-AAACAATTTCTCCAGCACTG-3′ and reverse primer: 5′-ATTCTGAGGCATCAACTGAC-3′). The PCR product was cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega), amplified, and linearized with Nco I. Ribonuclease protection assay (RPA) was performed using the RPA-III kit (Ambion), but substituting RNase ONE (Promega) for the supplied RNases. Protected fragments with the following lengths: iNOS, 249; IFN-γ, 210; IFN-β, 312; GAPDH, 97, were resolved using a 5% polyacrylamide:bisacrylamide (19:1) TBU (25 mm Tris borate, 2.5 mm EDTA, 8 m urea) gel. Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography and PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). Following treatment with experimental agents, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and collected by centrifugation. For total cell extracts, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Igepal CA-630, 0.25% deoxycholic acid, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNaF, 1 mm activated Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml aprotonin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). Nuclear extracts were prepared based on a modification of published protocols (20Hoppe-Seyler F. Butz K. Rittmüller C. von Knebel Doeberitz M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 21Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Cells pellets were resuspended in 800 μl of ice-cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and 50 μl of Igepal CA-630 added. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Nuclear proteins were extracted in buffer B (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove debris. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad assay. 5 μg of protein per sample was resolved by SDS-PAGE, and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked with blocking buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 140 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% nonfat dry milk) prior to incubation with primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer. After washing 3 times in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, membranes were incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Chemiluminescent detection with luminol was performed according to manufacturer’s protocol (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Antibodies were obtained from the following sources: anti-STAT-1α, anti-p-STAT-1 (Tyr-701), anti-IRF-1, anti-IRF-2, anti-iNOS, and all secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-p-STAT-1 (Ser-727) was purchased from Upstate. For quantifying units of interferon-β in cell culture media, samples were submitted to PBL Biomedical Laboratories for analysis. To assay for interferon content, samples were added to cultures of murine L929 fibroblasts and challenged with encephalomyocarditis virus (22Familletti P.C. Rubinstein S. Pestka S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 78: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 23Rubinstein S. Familletti P.C. Pestka S. J. Virol. 1981; 37: 755-758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One interferon unit per ml is defined as that quantity which inhibits the cytopathic effect of encephalomyocarditis virus by 50%. Cells were plated in 30 ml of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium in 100-mm culture plates at a density of 1 × 106/cm2 and allowed to adhere for 2 h. A 2-mm NO-electrode (World Precision Instruments) was lowered through a hole in the top of the culture dish to within 1 mm of the cell monolayer. After a baseline was established, cells were induced with LPS (1 μg/ml), or LPS (1 μg/ml) + IFN-β (100 units/ml), and the chart recording marked as time 0. A standard curve was generated using an anaerobic solution of authentic NO, and NO levels were calculated based on peak height. IFN-β is a critical and necessary component of the signaling processes leading to induction of the iNOS gene in murine macrophages (13Gao J.J. Filla M.B. Fultz M.J. Vogel S.N. Russell S.W. Murphy W.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4803-4810PubMed Google Scholar, 14Vadiveloo P.K. Vairo G. Hertzog P. Kola I. Hamilton J.A. Cytokine. 2000; 12: 1639-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We sought to determine the capacity of RAW macrophages to express and secrete IFN-β in response to LPS. Because IFN-γ can also initiate signaling events activated by IFN-β, we investigated the expression of IFN-γ as well. Cells were cultured in 100-mm plates to a subconfluent density of 5 × 105/cm2, and treated with LPS (100 ng/ml). A RPA was used to monitor either IFN-β or IFN-γ transcripts in a series of time points following induction. Total RNA was extracted at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h after treatment, and simultaneously probed with 32P-radiolabeled antisense constructs for IFN-β or IFN-γ, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (loading control) transcripts. Data reveal that IFN-β mRNA was not expressed in untreated cells. Addition of LPS induced IFN-β mRNA within 1 h, peak levels were attained by 4 h, and levels subsequently declined over the remaining time points (Fig. 1). This observation suggests the potential existence of a regulatory mechanism for a timed and limited expression of IFN-β. In contrast, IFN-γ mRNA is constitutively expressed in RAW macrophages, but at a low level compared with the LPS-inducible IFN-β expression (data not shown). Also, addition of LPS had no effect on the basal expression of IFN-γ mRNA. This lack of induction suggests that IFN-γ does not share the autocrine/paracrine functions of IFN-β in LPS-treated macrophages. The amount of IFN-β secreted into the culture medium was measured by viral inhibition assay on murine L929 cells challenged with encephalomyocarditis virus. RAW macrophages at a density of 5 × 105/cm2 were treated with LPS, and the medium was sampled at 1, 4, and 8 h and assayed for IFN-β. At 1 h after LPS addition, IFN-β was below the detection limit of the assay (<6 units/ml). At 4 h, the mean level of IFN-β was 530 units/ml, and at 8 h the mean level was 2561 units/ml (Fig.2). The highly inducible expression and the timing of IFN-β in response to LPS agree with and support the current model of an autocrine/paracrine role for IFN-β in macrophage induction. Binding of IFN-β to functional Type I-IFN receptor results in activation of JAK-STAT signaling pathways. Phosphorylated STAT proteins regulate gene transcription by binding to conserved sequences in the promoters of IFN-induced genes, includingiNOS (24Platanias L.C. Fish E.N. Exp. Hematol. 1999; 27: 1583-1592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The promoter of the murine iNOS gene contains GAS elements, which mediate the binding of STAT homo- and heterodimers (25Xie Q.W. Cho H.J. Calaycay J. Mumford R.A. Swiderek K.M. Lee T.D. Ding A. Troso T. Nathan C. Science. 1992; 256: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated STAT-1 is a protein that is common to many functional STAT complexes. Therefore, we sought to determine, by Western blot analysis, the kinetics of STAT-1 phosphorylation in response to LPS, as an example of the autocrine/paracrine activation of an IFN-dependent signaling process. RAW macrophages at a density of 5 × 105/cm2 were treated with either LPS (100 ng/ml), or as a positive control for IFN-dependent pathway activation, IFN-β (100 units/ml) for various time periods. Nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed by Western blot using a STAT-1α/p91 antibody. We observed a time-dependent phosphorylation in response to LPS, observed as a shift in the mobility of the STAT-1α band (Fig.3). The phosphorylated band appeared 2 h following treatment with LPS, and remained elevated. The p-STAT-1α band was also observed, although sooner and with greater intensity, in samples treated with IFN-β. Two phosphorylation sites, Tyr-701 and Ser-727, differentially regulate STAT-1 (26Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar, 27Zhu X. Wen Z. Xu L.Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6618-6623Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Because phosphorylation of both sites is required for maximal transcriptional activity, we wanted to determine if one or both sites are phosphorylated in response to LPS. To this end, Western blots were performed using antibodies specific for tyrosine- and serine-phosphorylated forms of STAT-1. We observed that STAT-1 is phosphorylated on both residues Tyr-701 and Ser-727 in LPS-treated cells (Fig. 3), and that the approximate 2-h delay in phosphorylation corresponds with the timing of endogenous IFN-β synthesis. As anticipated, treatment of macrophages with IFN-β alone also causes phosphorylation of STAT-1 on both Tyr-701 and Ser-727 residues, but with comparatively rapid kinetics, as phosphorylation was observed within 30 min of IFN-β addition. Based on the similar kinetics and intensity of tyrosine and serine phosphorylation, we hypothesize that the mobility shift in the upper blot of Fig. 3 likely represents STAT-1α that is phosphorylated on both residues. IFN-stimulated STAT activation mediates the expression of a second family of transcription factors, the IRF proteins (28Nguyen H. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 293-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Since a critical role for IRF-1 has been described for the expression of iNOS in murine macrophages, we sought to determine the effect of LPS on the levels of IRF-1, and on its antagonistic counterpart, IRF-2. RAW macrophages at a density of 5 × 105/cm2were treated with either LPS (100 ng/ml), or as a positive control, IFN-β (100 units/ml). Nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed by Western blot using antibodies against IRF-1 and IRF-2. In unstimulated macrophages IRF-1 is not expressed at a detectable level (Fig.4). Following treatment with LPS, however, a dramatic time-dependent increase in the levels of IRF-1 is observed that correlates with the timing of STAT-1 phosphorylation. As anticipated, IRF-1 is expressed sooner in samples treated with IFN-β. The relative delay of IRF-1 expression in LPS-treated samples is likely related to the time needed for the synthesis and secretion of IFN-β as an autocrine/paracrine signal. In contrast to IRF-1, the level of IRF-2 was relatively high in nuclear extracts from unstimulated macrophages. The basal expression of IRF-2 was unaffected by either LPS or IFN-β, suggesting that the induction of IRF-1 rather than inhibition of IRF-2 expression mediates the IFN-dependent expression of murine iNOS. Having shown that IFN-β is induced and secreted in response to LPS, we next studied the effect of blocking IFN-β with neutralizing antibodies on the time course of iNOS induction. RAW macrophages at a density of 5 × 105/cm2 were treated with either LPS (100 ng/ml), or a combination of LPS (100 ng/ml) and a polyclonal anti-IFN-β neutralizing antibody (1000 neutralization units/ml). The addition of neutralizing antibody did not totally block, but did significantly attenuate the induction of iNOS mRNA as determined by RPA (Fig. 5). Accordingly, the magnitude of iNOS expression was lower in the presence of neutralizing antibody than with LPS alone at all time points measured. Curiously, whereas iNOS transcription in antibody-treated samples was not totally blocked, expression did plateau at 6 h after induction. In contrast, iNOS expression in samples treated with LPS only continued to rise over the course of the experiment. This observation implies that IFN-β-dependent signals function in initiating transcription, as well as in the continued generation of iNOS message at later time points. Detectable levels of iNOS transcript in RAW macrophages are typically observed between 2 and 4 h following treatment with LPS (100 ng/ml). The recent reports implicating IFN-β as an autocrine signal in the transcriptional activation of iNOS by LPS motivated us to investigate the effect of exogenous IFN-β on the timing of iNOS induction. RAW macrophages were cultured in 100-mm plates to a density of 5 × 105/cm2, and treated with LPS (100 ng/ml) or a combination of LPS (100 ng/ml) and IFN-β (100 units/ml). These were subsequently assayed by RPA for the presence of iNOS mRNA in a series of time points following induction (Fig. 6 A). Total RNA was extracted at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 h after treatment, and simultaneously probed with 32P-radiolabeled antisense constructs complementary to sequences within the iNOS and GAPDH (loading control) transcripts. The data reveal that IFN-β accelerates the induction of iNOS mRNA by LPS, with significant levels of iNOS mRNA being detected within 2 h following treatment. PhosphorImager analysis of the RPA gel illustrates the effect of IFN-β plus LPS in hastening the production of iNOS transcript, in contrast to treatment with LPS alone. Also, IFN-β synergizes with LPS to enhance the level of iNOS mRNA expression as much as 5.7-fold over LPS alone at the 4-h time point, and maintaining a higher level of expression throughout the experiment. We also investigated the effect of IFN-β on iNOS protein expression in response to LPS. RAW macrophages were again cultured in 100-mm plates at a density of 5 × 105/cm2, and treated with LPS (100 ng/ml) or both LPS (100 ng/ml) and IFN-β (100 units/ml). Cells were lysed with RIPA buffer and samples analyzed by Western blot using a commercially available polyclonal antibody against murine iNOS. LPS-treated RAW macrophages express detectable levels of iNOS protein within 4–6 h following stimulation. Treatment with LPS and IFN-β together accelerated the rate of protein expression, with significant levels of iNOS being detected by Western blot analysis within the first 2 h (Fig. 6 B). This temporal shift in protein expression to a time point ∼3 h earlier than treatment with LPS alone concurs with the data obtained for iNOS transcript expression. Likewise, the synergy between IFN-β and LPS is observed in the magnitude of iNOS protein expression, as indicated by the density of the iNOS bands. This indicates that the effects of IFN-β in accelerating and synergizing iNOS expression in response to LPS is affected at the level of transcription, but maintained at the level of protein expression. To determine if the acceleration of iNOS induction was maintained to the level of enzyme catalytic activity, we monitored formation of the iNOS product, NO, using a modified Clark-type NO-electrode. RAW macrophages at a density of 1 × 106/cm2were induced with either LPS (1 μg/ml) or LPS (1 μg/ml) + IFN-β (100 units/ml). Addition of LPS alone resulted in the detection of NO at ∼6 h following induction (Fig. 7). A steady-state level of NO generation was achieved by about 9 h, with a maximum detected concentration of 305 nm. Addition of l-N G-monomethylarginine (1 mm) caused a sharp decline in the level of NO, with levels returning to baseline within 15 min of addition, indicating that the source of NO in this experiment was due to enzymatic generation by NOS. In contrast, addition of LPS plus IFN-β resulted in detectable NO levels within 3 h of induction. This observation is consistent with the temporal shifts seen in both mRNA and protein expression of iNOS. A steady-state level of NO formation was achieved within 6 h, and the maximum NO concentration observed was 316 nm. Again, the source of this NO was enzymatic, as indicated by the total ablation of detectable NO following the addition ofl-N G-monomethylarginine. The production of NO by macrophages has been implicated as a host defense mechanism against pathogens and neoplastic cells. Expression of iNOS leads to the high-output production of NO, for which several mechanisms of cellular toxicity have been proposed. For example, NO has been shown to inhibit the activity of the iron-sulfur containing respiratory enzyme, aconitase, and heme-containing proteins such as cytochrome c oxidase (1Hibbs Jr., J.B. Taintor R.R. Vavrin Z. Rachlin E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar,29Stuehr D.J. Nathan C.F. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1543-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar). It can also cause the disruption of zinc-containing proteins, such as metallothionein and zinc-finger containing transcription factors (30Kröncke K.D. Fehsel K. Schmidt T. Zenke F.T. Dasting I. Wesener J.R. Bettermann H. Breunig K.D. Kolb-Bachofen V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1105-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Also, NO may elicit a cytostatic effect by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase and therefore, DNA synthesis (31Kwon N.S. Stuehr D.J. Nathan C.F. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 761-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Cytostasis of target cells is also achieved by NO-mediated nitrosation of ornithine decarboxylase, which is the rate-determining enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis (32Bauer P.M. Fukuto J.M. Buga G.M. Pegg A.E. Ignarro L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 33Ignarro L.J. Buga G.M. Wei L.H. Bauer P.M. Wu G. del Soldato P. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Furthermore, the cellular damage related to macrophage-derived NO has been reported to induce apoptosis in target tumor cells (35Cui S. Reichner J.S. Mateo R.B. Albina J.E. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2462-2467PubMed Google Scholar). Given the significance of NO in host defense, we sought to systematically investigate the mechanisms and timing of events leading from challenge with a pathogenic stimulus (LPS) to the generation of NO by macrophages. In this report, we present a comprehensive study on the induction of iNOS by LPS in RAW macrophages, measuring and correlating events leading from signal transduction to iNOS transcription, protein expression, and product formation. We believe one of the values of this study is in unifying several individually addressed phenomena into a single investigation, in which a cellular response has been followed from the initiation of signaling cascades to the production of a cytotoxic effector molecule. Previous reports on the mechanisms of iNOS induction in macrophages clearly implicate IFN-β as a critical intermediate (12Fujihara M. Ito N. Pace J.L. Watanabe Y. Russell S.W. Suzuki T. J. Biol.

Based on the evidence that we have obtained, and on these earlier reports, a current model for the signaling events mediating the expression of iNOS in response to LPS is presented in Fig. 8. According to this model, the expression of iNOS is regulated by a combination of LPS- and IFN-induced transcription factors. One aspect of this model that we have previously examined is the necessary role of NF-κB for the induction of iNOS in LPS-treated RAW macrophages (38Griscavage J.M. Wilk S. Ignarro L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3308-3312Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In the present study, we sought to confirm the role of endogenous IFN-β as an autocrine/paracrine activator of iNOS expression, and to determine the timing of downstream events, including activation of the JAK/STAT and IRF signaling pathways, iNOS transcription and translation, and ultimately NO generation. Activation of NF-κB by LPS mediates transcription of IFN-β (39Hiscott J. Alper D. Cohen L. Leblanc J.F. Sportza L. Wong A. Xanthoudakis S. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 2557-2566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Dirks W. Mittnacht S. Rentrop M. Hauser H. J. Interferon Res. 1989; 9: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 41Lenardo M.J.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In our observations, IFN-dependent signaling pathways are activated in response to LPS in a time-dependent manner that correlates with the expression and secretion of IFN-β. Accordingly, we have seen that STAT-1 is phosphorylated on Tyr-701 and Ser-727 in LPS-treated RAW cells within the same time frame as IFN-β expression. Similar findings have been reported elsewhere. In particular, in the Bac1.2F5 macrophage LPS treatment also causes phosphorylation of STAT-1 on Ser-727. This requires activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, as demonstrated by use of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor, SB203580 (43Kovarik P. Stoiber D. Eyers P.A. Menghini R. Neininger A. Gaestel M. Cohen P. Decker T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13956-13961Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been reported that p38 kinase activity is stimulated by IFN-α/β (44Uddin S. Majchrzak B. Woodson J. Arunkumar P. Alsayed Y. Pine R. Young P.R. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30127-30131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). It is possible that the serine phosphorylation of STAT-1 we observe in RAW cells is partly mediated by a p38-dependent pathway. We also demonstrate that LPS induces a time-dependent induction in IRF-1 synthesis. It has been previously reported in that expression of IRF-1 is essential for the induction of iNOS in murine macrophages. First, macrophages from IRF-1 (−/−)mice fail to express iNOS in response to infection withMycobacterium bovis (18Kamijo R. Harada H. Matsuyama T. Bosland M. Gerecitano J. Shapiro D. Le J. Koh S.I. Kimura T. Green S.J. Mak T.W. Taniguchi T. Vilcek J. Science. 1994; 263: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar) Furthermore, experiments with iNOS reporter constructs in RAW macrophages indicate that the IRF-element at nucleotides −913 to −923 is necessary for the synergistic effects of IFN-γ (19Martin E. Nathan C. Xie Q.W. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Some reports indicate that exceptions to this model may exist, and deserve study in RAW macrophages. For example, in J774 macrophages, the protein synthesis inhibitor cyclohexamide did not block, but rather potentiated transcription of the IRF-1 gene in response to LPS, implying that IRF-1 could be induced by an undefined IFN-independent mechanism (45Hattori Y. Akimoto K. Matsumura M. Tseng C.C. Kasai K. Shimoda S. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 40: 889-896PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of IFN-β as an autocrine/paracrine mediator of iNOS activation in RAW macrophages was confirmed by the use of antibody against IFN-β. Simultaneous incubation with IFN-β-neutralizing antibody and LPS attenuated the induction of iNOS mRNA compared with LPS alone. This result is consistent with earlier investigations in both RAW macrophages and other cell types (12Fujihara M. Ito N. Pace J.L. Watanabe Y. Russell S.W. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12773-12778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Gao J.J. Filla M.B. Fultz M.J. Vogel S.N. Russell S.W. Murphy W.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4803-4810PubMed Google Scholar, 37Zhang X. Alley E.W. Russell S.W. Morrison D.C. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 33-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also consistent with these reports was our observation that iNOS expression was inhibited, but not completely blocked, by IFN-β-antibody treatment. The inability to completely abolish iNOS expression with neutralizing antibody against IFN-β implies to us that in RAW cells, additional LPS-dependent pathways to iNOS gene expression may be operating. Perhaps, as demonstrated in the Bac1.2F5 macrophage line, LPS may also be capable of stimulating STAT phosphorylation though an interferon-independent mechanism (43Kovarik P. Stoiber D. Eyers P.A. Menghini R. Neininger A. Gaestel M. Cohen P. Decker T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13956-13961Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Seeing that the endogenous secretion of IFN-β stimulates transcription of the iNOS gene in RAW cells, we hypothesized that bypassing this step by the addition of exogenous IFN-β should accelerate the induction of iNOS by LPS. Indeed, macrophages treated with LPS and IFN-β expressed iNOS mRNA 2–3 h sooner than macrophages treated with LPS alone. In our observations, this corresponds to the time required for the synthesis and secretion of IFN-β in LPS-treated macrophages, which supports an autocrine/paracrine role for endogenous IFN-β. The acceleration of iNOS induction by IFN-β is also observed at the level of iNOS protein expression, and at the level NO generation by means of an NO electrode. Also, we believe this to be the first report in which an NO electrode has been used to continuously monitor NO levels produced by cultured macrophages following activation. The acceleration of iNOS induction by exogenous IFN-β suggests that the cytokine environment of macrophages may determine the rate of iNOS induction in response to LPS. Acting as a co-stimulatory signal, IFN-β both accelerates and potentiates the induction of iNOS in response to LPS. In contrast, it has been reported by others that preincubating murine macrophages with IFN-β attenuates iNOS induction in response to LPS (46López-Collazo E. Hortelano S. Rojas A. Boscá L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2889-2895PubMed Google Scholar, 47Gao J.J. Filla M.B. Lorsbach R.B. Pace J.L. Crespo A. Russell S.W. Murphy W.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 1551-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The explanations for this phenomenon differ in the two reports. In one case, IFN-β was indicated to attenuate subsequent NF-κB activation by LPS. Alternatively, the other report provides evidence for an enhanced turnover of phosphorylated STAT-1 subsequent to a prolonged treatment with IFN-β. These observations, in conjunction with what we and others report, suggests a novel dual role for IFN-β in mediating iNOS transcription that depends upon the concomitant levels of bacterial endotoxin. Accordingly, we propose that when LPS is present as a co-stimulatory signal, IFN-β accelerates and potentiates the induction of iNOS. As infection levels decline and LPS is low or absent, IFN-β attenuates macrophage activation. We believe that this is an interesting model for macrophage autoregulation that deserves further study in vitro and in animal models. We thank Drs. Kate Farrell, Sheila Scully, and Meiying Qi of Amgen for assistance in preparing antisense oligonucleotide constructs for use in ribonucleotide protection assays.

Here, we use genetic and biochemical analysis in Drosophila to show that the transmembrane protein Off-track (OTK) associates with Plexin A, the receptor for Sema 1a, and that OTK is a component of the repulsive signaling response to Semaphorin ligands. In vitro, OTK associates with Plexins. In vivo, mutations in the otk gene lead to phenotypes resembling those of loss-of-function mutations of either Sema1a or PlexA. The otk gene displays strong genetic interactions with Sema1a and PlexA, suggesting that OTK and Plexin A function downstream of Sema 1a."
https://openalex.org/W1483575706,"Rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton are involved in a variety of cellular processes from locomotion of cells to morphological alterations of the cell surface. One important question is how local interactions of cells with the extracellular space are translated into alterations of their membrane organization. To address this problem, we studied CASK, a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase homologues family of adaptor proteins. CASK has been shown to bind the erythrocyte isoform of protein 4.1, a class of proteins that promote formation of actin/spectrin microfilaments. In neurons, CASK also interacts via its PDZ domain with the cytosolic C termini of neurexins, neuron-specific cell-surface proteins. We now show that CASK binds a brain-enriched isoform of protein 4.1, and nucleates local assembly of actin/spectrin filaments. These interactions can be reconstituted on the cytosolic tail of neurexins. Furthermore, CASK can be recovered with actin filaments prepared from rat brain extracts, and neurexins are recruited together with CASK and protein 4.1 into these actin filaments. Thus, analogous to the PDZ-domain protein p55 and glycophorin C at the erythrocyte membrane, a similar complex comprising CASK and neurexins exists in neurons. Our data suggest that intercellular junctions formed by neurexins, such as junctions initiated by β-neurexins with neuroligins, are at least partially coupled to the actin cytoskeleton via an interaction with CASK and protein 4.1.

They were initially identified as receptors for α-latrotoxin, a spider venom toxin that triggers massive release of synaptic vesicles from the presynaptic terminal (2Ushkaryov Y.A. Petrenko A.G. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Science. 1992; 257: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). In a splice-site specific manner, a subset of β-neurexins interacts with neuroligins, neuronal cell-surface proteins localized to postsynaptic membranes of excitatory synapses (3Ichtchenko K. Hata Y.

All neurexins have short, highly conserved intracellular C termini, which are recognized by the PDZ domain of CASK, a protein primarily expressed in brain, but also detectable in other tissues (5Hata Y. Butz S. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CASK is a member of the family of MAGUK1 proteins that are involved in the organization of membrane-associated protein complexes (6Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1999; 11: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 7Dimitratos S.D. Woods D.F. Stathakis D.G. Bryant P.J.

In neurons, CASK is found at synapses and is localized at both the pre- and postsynaptic membranes of mainly excitatory synapses (9Hsueh Y.P. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7415-7425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to neurexins, CASK also binds to the syndecan family of neuronal heparan sulfate proteoglycans, members of which are localized at synapses and axons as well as glial cells (10Hsueh Y.P.

Chishti A.H. Anderson J.M. Wood D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In epithelial cells, CASK interacts with junctional adhesion molecule at sites of intercellular contacts (12Martinez-Estrada O.M. Villa A. Breviario F. Orsenigo F. Dejana E. Bazzoni G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9291-9296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The function of CASK is unknown. In neurons, the majority of CASK is associated with membranes and it forms a stable, tripartite complex with the brain-enriched Veli proteins and the brain-specific Mint1 (13Butz S. Okamoto M. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1998; 94: 773-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar,14Borg J.P. Straight S.W. Kaech S.M. de Taddeo-Borg M. Kroon D.E. Karnak D. Turner R.S. Kim S.K. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31633-31636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). CASK anchors this complex to neurexins (13Butz S. Okamoto M. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1998; 94: 773-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). One of the complex components, Mint1, provides an alternate mode of anchoring the tripartite complex to neurexins (15Biederer T. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; Google Scholar) and may be involved in synaptic vesicle traffic (16Okamoto M. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31459-31464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). This tripartite complex was proposed to serve as nucleation site for the assembly of synaptic plasma membrane proteins. It is evolutionarily conserved, as the Caenorhabditis elegans CASK homologue Lin-2 forms the complex by interaction with Lin-10, the Mint1 homologue, and Lin-7, the Velis homologue. In epithelial cells of C. elegans, these components are required for the correct localization of an epidermal growth factor-like receptor tyrosine kinase (17Simske J.S. Kaech S.M. Harp S.A. Kim S.K.

Cell. 1998; 94: 761-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CASK also binds to protein 4.1 (11Cohen A.R. Woods D.F. Marfatia S.M. Walther Z. Chishti A.H. Anderson J.M. Wood D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), a peripheral membrane protein initially identified in erythrocytes. Protein 4.1 promotes association of F-actin with tetrameric spectrin and thereby stabilizes the cytoskeleton (19Correas I. Leto T.L. Speicher D.W. Marchesi V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3310-3315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several genes encode distinct protein 4.1 isoforms that are differentially expressed in various tissues (20Hoover K.B. Bryant P.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). A binding site for protein 4.1 is conserved in the HOOK region of three vertebrate MAGUK proteins, namely erythrocyte p55 (21Marfatia S.M. Leu R.A. Branton D. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 715-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), CASK (11Cohen A.R. Woods D.F. Marfatia S.M. Walther Z. Chishti A.H. Anderson J.M. Wood D.F. J.

This trimeric complex therefore provides two binding sites for protein 4.1, one found on the cytosolic domain of glycophorin C, the other on p55, which binds the extreme C terminus of glycophorin C via its PDZ domain (26Marfatia S.M.

As a result, the majority of protein 4.1 associates with the plasma membrane at sites where glycophorin C is localized (25Hemming N.J. Anstee D.J. Staricoff M.A. Tanner M.J. Mohandas N. J. Biol.

Although CASK has been best defined as a component of the tripartite complex, the fact that CASK was found to interact with several cell adhesion molecules, and is expressed also outside the brain, led us to hypothesize that CASK may have a more general role. We here demonstrate that, in brain, CASK interacts with neuronal protein 4.1N (30Walensky L.D. Blackshaw S. Liao D. Watkins C.C. Weier H.U. Parra M. Huganir R.L. Conboy J.G. Mohandas N. Snyder S.H.

Brain Res. 1999; 117: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We reconstituted the complex of CASK and protein 4.1N on the cytosolic tail of neurexin I and observed the formation of stable actin/spectrin microfilaments. Importantly, this localized cytoskeletal assembly is temperature-dependent and is abolished in presence of ATP. As predicted by these results, CASK co-fractionates with preparations of the actin cytoskeleton, and neurexins could be recruited into these cytoskeletal preparations. Our data suggest a general function for CASK as an adaptor protein that links sites of cell adhesion to the intracellular actin cytoskeleton. Actin has recently been localized to the active zone of the presynaptic membrane (32Morales M. Colicos M.A. Goda Y. Neuron. 2000; 27: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), and several components characterized in this study are also synaptically localized, which could indicate a function of CASK in plastic changes of synaptic membranes. The Escherichia coli expression vectors encoding GST-neurexin I and GST-neurexin IΔ10 (originally named GST-neurexin IΔ3) have been described previously (33Hata Y. Davletov B. Petrenko A.G. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Neuron. 1993; 10: 307-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The vector encoding full-length GST-CASK was a gift of Dr. Anton Maximov (University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas, TX). Mutations were inserted by PCR using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Monoclonal antibodies directed against CASK were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Cincinnati, OH). Antibodies directed against actin and spectrin were purchased from Sigma. Antibodies specific for protein 4.1N were a kind gift of Dr. S. Snyder (The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). Monoclonal antibodies against GDP dissociation inhibitor protein (GDI) were a kind gift from Dr. R. Jahn (Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Göttingen, Germany). Antibodies directed against Velis were described previously (13Butz S. Okamoto M. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1998; 94: 773-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Rat forebrains (PelFreez, Rogers, AR) were homogenized in 3 ml of buffer A (20 mmHepes (pH 7.4), 125 mm potassium acetate, 5 mmmagnesium chloride, 320 mm sucrose, 1.0% Triton X-100)/brain in the presence of protease inhibitors. The homogenate was incubated 60 min on ice and homogenized 30 times in a pestle tissue grinder using a slow speed stirrer. The samples were then centrifuged using a Sorvall S80-AT3 rotor with 80,000 rpm (280,000 ×g) for 15 min at 2 °C, which pellets particles larger than 150 S. This first supernatant was kept on ice. The resulting pellet was suspended again in 2 ml of buffer A/brain in presence of protease inhibitors, incubated 60 min on ice, homogenized 20 times, and spun again at 150 S. The supernatants of both centrifugations were combined and passed through a 0.2-μm SFCA syringe filter (Nalgene). GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli and immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). Peptides of 12 amino acids length were synthesized on an ABI synthesizer. The peptide sequence CNKKNKDKEYYV corresponds to the 11 C-terminal amino acids of neurexin I, with an N-terminal cysteine for coupling to SulfoLink beads (Pierce). Proteins solubilized from rat forebrain were incubated with immobilized GST fusion proteins or peptides for 14 h at 4 °C. Where indicated, the samples were warmed to 30 °C for 60 min at the end of this incubation. For ATP regeneration, samples were adjusted to 1 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 1 mg/ml creatine kinase (Sigma). At the end of the binding, the beads were layered on 30 bead volumes of a sucrose cushion consisting of buffer A adjusted to 600 mmsucrose on ice, allowed to sink through the cushion, and then washed repeatedly. Samples were eluted first with one column volume of buffer A containing 800 mm potassium acetate for 10 min on ice. Where indicated, the second elution was performed using one column volume of 200 mm sodium carbonate (pH 11.5), 1.0% Triton X-100 for 20 min on ice. Finally, beads were eluted with one column volume of 2.0% SDS, 200 mm Tris (pH 6.8). For quantification, samples were analyzed by immunoblotting using125I-labeled secondary antibodies and the signals were quantified using a Fuji PhosphorImager and the ImageQuant program. Rat forebrains were homogenized as described above with the exception that the solubilization times on ice were 2 h each. Aliquots of the detergent solubilizate were incubated under mild agitation for 12–16 h at 4 °C. The samples were then diluted 1:4 with buffer A, and particles larger than 1000 S were pelleted using a Sorvall S80-AT3 rotor with 30,000 rpm (45,000 × g) for 11 min at 2 °C. The supernatants were discarded, and the pellets (P1) suspended in buffer A. To wash these P1preparations, they were diluted in buffer A and incubated for 30 min on ice. Particles larger than 1000 S were then pelleted a second time in an Hitachi S45-A rotor with 34,000 rpm (52,000 × g) for 11 min at 2 °C to prepare P2 and S2fractions. For stringent treatment of P1 preparations, this washing step was performed in buffer A containing 400 mmpotassium iodide or 400 mm potassium acetate, leading to salt-extracted P2 and S2 fractions. To analyze the cytoskeletal recruitment of GST-neurexin I and GST-neurexin IΔ10, these proteins were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and eluted using reduced glutathione. Rat brain detergent solubilizate was prepared as described above. The glutathione eluates were added at a final concentration of 20 μg of GST fusion protein/ml, bovine serum albumin was added at 1 mg/ml, and the samples were processed as described. CASK and the two other MAGUK family members p55 and hDLG/SAP97 have been reported previously to interact with protein 4.1 from erythrocytes (11Cohen A.R. Woods D.F. Marfatia S.M. Walther Z. Chishti A.H. Anderson J.M. Wood D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 22Lue R.A. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In case of the erythrocyte MAGUK p55, the protein 4.1 binding site is located in the HOOK region, i.e. between the Src homology 3 and guanylate kinase domains (21Marfatia S.M. Leu R.A. Branton D. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 715-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This sequence contains a stretch of four lysines, which is conserved in the three MAGUKs known to bind protein 4.1, but not in other members of this protein family (Fig.1 A). To address whether this tetralysine motif helps to constitute the protein 4.1 binding site on CASK, we mutated the amino acids (KKKK)691–694 of CASK to TTTT and expressed this mutant CASK*4.1 as GST fusion protein. Identical amounts of wild-type GST-CASK and mutated GST-CASK*4.1 were immobilized on beads and were incubated with proteins solubilized from rat forebrain homogenates. We analyzed binding of a neuronal isoform of protein 4.1, protein 4.1N, that has been identified recently (30Walensky L.D. Blackshaw S. Liao D. Watkins C.C. Weier H.U. Parra M. Huganir R.L. Conboy J.G. Mohandas N. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6457-6467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Ohara R. Yamakawa H. Nakayama M. Yuasa S. Ohara O. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1999; 117: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In initial experiments, the binding of protein 4.1N to GST-CASK was observed, but only at comparatively low yields (Fig. 1 A,lane 3; data not shown). After varying the binding conditions, we noted that an elevation of the temperature at the end of the incubation led to markedly increased retention of protein 4.1 on CASK (Fig. 1 B, lane 5). In contrast, binding of protein 4.1N to the GST-CASK*4.1 mutant was strongly reduced at elevated temperature (Fig. 1 B, lane 7 versus lane 5) and in the cold (Fig. 1 C). These results demonstrate that CASK interacts with this brain-specific protein 4.1 isoform, and that the conserved tetralysine motif contributes strongly. The salt resistance of this binding indicates that this motif provides not only electrostatic, but also hydrophobic interactions. Protein 4.1 promotes interaction of spectrin and actin, and indeed both proteins were retained on immobilized CASK in presence of higher amounts of protein 4.1 (Fig. 1 B, lane 5). Veli proteins, which interact with CASK on a domain distant to the protein 4.1-interaction domain, bound both wild-type and mutated CASK identically and this interaction was independent of the temperature (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3, 5, and 7). Rab GDI, monitored as a negative control, was not retained (Fig. 1 A). CASK binds to the intracellular C termini of neurexins and other cell-surface proteins (5Hata Y. Butz S. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further characterize the interaction of CASK with neurexins and protein 4.1, we performed affinity chromatography experiments with the complete cytosolic sequence of neurexin I. The 56 C-terminal amino acids of neurexin I were expressed as a GST fusion protein (GST-neurexin I), and immobilized on beads. As a control, we used a truncated GST-neurexin fusion protein that lacked the 10 C-terminal amino acids (GST-neurexin IΔ10), and does not bind CASK (5Hata Y. Butz S. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The experiment was performed in two affinity chromatography steps, using proteins solubilized from rat forebrain as starting material (Fig.2 A). First, proteins that bind to neurexin I independent of its C-terminal residues were removed by passing detergent-solubilized forebrain proteins over a column containing GST-neurexin IΔ10. One half of the flow-through from this column was loaded onto a first GST-neurexin I column, and the other half was adjusted to contain an ATP-regenerating system and was then loaded, in parallel, onto a second GST-neurexin I column. All three columns (the initial GST-neurexin IΔ10 column, and the two subsequently loaded GST-neurexin I columns) were sequentially eluted with high salt solution, alkaline sodium carbonate buffer, and SDS. Analysis of the eluted material by immunoblotting confirmed that CASK specifically bound to full-length GST-neurexin I independent of ATP (Fig. 2 B, lanes 6 and 7 and lanes 9 and 10) but not to GST-neurexin IΔ10 (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2–4). This interaction was very strong, as CASK was quantitatively depleted from the flow-through of the column (data not shown). The interaction of CASK with neurexin I was resistant to elution with high salt, and CASK could only be recovered by stringent elutions with alkaline pH and SDS (Fig.2 B, lanes 5–7). If CASK serves as an adaptor molecule for protein 4.1 in neurons, we should be able to observe CASK-mediated recruitment of protein 4.1N on neurexins. Indeed, salt-resistant binding of protein 4.1N occurred and was dependent on neurexin’s intact C terminus, suggesting that CASK was an intermediary (Fig. 2 B, lanes 6 and 7 and lanes 9 and 10). The negative control protein GDI was not retained (Fig. 2 B). Coomassie staining of these fractions revealed that CASK or protein 4.1N were not the most abundant proteins to be affinity-purified (Fig.2 C). Two proteins of ∼230 and 43 kDa were the major protein components captured on GST-neurexin I but not on GST-neurexin IΔ10 (Fig. 2 C, lanes 6 and 7). These proteins were identified as spectrin and actin by mass spectrometry and microsequencing. This suggests that, under our conditions, the complex of protein 4.1 and CASK immobilized on neurexins promotes salt-resistant assembly of actin microfilaments and spectrin. Interestingly, the recovery of spectrin and actin filaments was abolished in presence of ATP (Fig. 2 C, compare lanes 6 and 7 and lanes 9 and 10). In addition, a specifically bound protein of ∼55 kDa was identified by mass spectrometry as fascin, an actin-bundling protein that is brain-specific in vertebrates (34Edwards R.A. Herrera-Sosa H. Otto J. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10764-10770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The above results do not exclude that two different neurexin populations exist, one attached to protein 4.1 and CASK, the other to filamentous actin immobilized independently of protein 4.1. To address the composition of these complexes more directly, we took advantage of a thrombin cleavage site between the GST moiety and neurexin I. This makes it possible to use mild thrombin treatment to elute neurexin’s cytoplasmic domain together with proteins bound to neurexin (Fig.3 A). Detergent-solubilized forebrain proteins were loaded onto immobilized GST-neurexin I as described above, and proteins bound to neurexin were cleaved off the beads with thrombin together with the cytoplasmic domain of neurexin. The cytoskeletal components of this complex were immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against spectrin, and the distribution of CASK was determined. CASK was quantitatively bound to GST-neurexin I and, as expected, could be eluted by thrombin, whereas GDI was completely recovered in the initial flow-through (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–3). Coomassie staining and immunoblotting confirmed that the spectrin-containing actin microfilaments were formed on the beads and released after thrombin cleavage of the neurexin domain (data not shown). The material eluted with thrombin was subsequently subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies directed against spectrin and was shown to contain CASK (Fig. 3 B, lanes 4 and 5). Thrombin served as negative control for the immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3 B). This allows to conclude that CASK is an integral part of the spectrin/actin assemblies formed around the cytosolic domain of neurexin I in vitro. The results presented above suggest that CASK together with members of the protein 4.1 family may function to link the actin cytoskeleton to cell-surface molecules like neurexins or syndecans. This would predict that CASK is incorporated into actin cytoskeleton preparations assembled in vitro from brain extracts. To test this, we incubated detergent extract from total rat brain at a high protein concentration, a condition under which actin microfilaments rapidly assemble in vitro once filament nucleation is provided (35Stokes D.L. DeRosier D.J. Biophys. J. 1991; 59: 456-465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The brain extract was incubated overnight in the cold and subsequently centrifuged. Immunoblotting (Fig.4 A) and Coomassie Blue staining of SDS gels (Fig. 4 B) revealed that CASK was partially recovered in the P1 pellet together with the cytoskeletal assemblies containing actin, spectrin, protein 4.1N, and fascin (Fig. 4, A and B, lanes 1 and 2; data not shown). Veli proteins, binding partners of CASK, were detected in the cytoskeletal preparation at a lower yield than CASK itself, consistent with an indirect recruitment via CASK (Fig.4 A). GDI, used as a negative control, was absent (Fig.4 A). After resuspension of the P1 pellet and repeated centrifugation, all of CASK was recovered in P2together with actin, spectrin, and fascin (Fig. 4 A,lanes 3 and 4). However, when the P1pellet was resuspended in buffer containing potassium iodide, a chaotropic salt, the majority of CASK as well as the cytoskeletal proteins were released into the supernatant S2 (Fig. 4,A and B, compare lanes 4 and 6). A high salt wash with potassium acetate neither extracted CASK nor the cytoskeletal assemblies, further demonstrating their firm association (Fig. 4, A and B,lanes 7 and 8). Notably, actin microfilament assembly from brain was not affected under our conditions by a final increase in the incubation temperature to 30 °C, and only weakly reduced in presence of ATP (data not shown). This provides evidence that the effects of temperature and ATP on localized actin assembly described above are specific. To further characterize the interaction of neurexin I with the actin cytoskeleton, we established an assay to analyze cytoskeletal recruitment of recombinant proteins. Soluble GST-neurexin I and GST-neurexin IΔ10 were prepared, and added to detergent-solubilized rat brain proteins (Fig.5, lanes 1, 2, and 4). Actin microfilaments were formed as described and recovered in a high speed P1 fraction (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 5), which excluded the negative control protein GDI. CASK, as well as protein 4.1N, could be recovered in these cytoskeletal assemblies (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 5). After resuspension of P1 and a second centrifugation, CASK and protein 4.1N were found almost completely in the P2fraction (Fig. 5, lanes 6 and 7). The truncated GST-neurexin IΔ10 was absent from the pelleted cytoskeletal fraction (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 3). However, GST-neurexin I was recruited into the P1 fraction together with actin microfilaments (Fig. 5, lanes 4 and 5). After resuspension of P1 and repeated centrifugation, this fraction of GST-neurexin I was almost quantitatively recovered in the P2 preparation (Fig. 5, lanes 6 and 7). In absence of brain proteins, GST-neurexin I remained completely soluble (Fig. 5, lane 9). These observations confirm that the cytosolic domain of neurexin I interacts with cytoskeletal assemblies in a stable manner dependent on its C terminus, presumably via CASK and protein 4.1. The cytoplasmic domain of neurexins contains a motif similar to a protein 4.1 binding site described in glycophorin C, a membrane protein in erythrocytes (20Hoover K.B. Bryant P.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Similarities were only found in the protein 4.1- and CASK-interacting sequences and are also conserved in the syndecan family of proteins (Fig.6 A). Therefore, two sites in neurexins could cooperate in the recruitment of protein 4.1, one provided by neurexin-bound CASK, the second on the cytosolic domain of neurexin itself. To te"

In the cortex, proliferating neuronal precursors move while passing through different stages of the cell cycle. At set times, these precursors arrest and embark on a long distance migration to form distinct cortical layers where they pass through several stages of neurite remodeling, pathfinding, and synaptogenesis (1Hatten M.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 511-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). A fundamental role in all of these processes is played by the continuous restructuring of the neuronal cytoskeleton. The p35/Cdk5 kinase is enriched in the developing CNS with the highest levels seen when neurons are migrating and remodeling (2Kwon Y.T. Tsai L.H. Results Probl.

Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3041) Google Scholar). In neurons, the function of Rac has been associated with dendritic remodeling, neurite branching, neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis, and growth cone collapse (26Luo L. Nat. Rev.

Nature. 1998; 395: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In Xenopus retinal ganglion cells, loss of p35/Cdk5 kinase activity can partially rescue defective axonogenesis induced by constitutively active Rac mutants, showing a conservation of this signaling pathway in vertebrates (29Ruchhoeft M.L. Ohnuma S. McNeill L. Holt C.E. Harris W.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8454-8463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In transfected cell lines or primary neurons, the p35/Cdk5 kinase is found in association with Rac and the serine/threonine kinase Pak1, a well characterized Rac and Cdc42 effector (24Nikolic M. Chou M.M. Lu W. Mayer B.J. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1998; 395: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar).

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 754-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Our previous work revealed Pak1 phosphorylation and subsequent down-regulation of its kinase activity in the presence of p35/Cdk5 (24Nikolic M. Chou M.M. Lu W. Mayer B.J. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1998; 395: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). We have now observed that the p35/Cdk5 kinase associates with a large portion of the Pak1 kinase domain and directly phosphorylates Pak1 on a unique site. This phosphorylation is crucial for the proper regulation of the cytoskeleton during neurite outgrowth. Together our data reveal the complexity of p35/Cdk5-mediated regulation of Pak1 in differentiating neurons. Recombinant glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-fused Pak1 proteins for expression inEscherichia coli were a generous gift from Gary Bokoch (Scripps Research Institute). Wild type Pak1 with the C-terminal K-Ras farnesilation sequence was a kind gift from Jonathan Chernoff (Fox Chase Cancer Center). Fragments of Pak1 for expression in mammalian cells were generated by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and subcloned into BamHI and ClaI sites of vector pEBG. Point mutations in wild type or Pak1R299 mutants were generated by PCR using the QuikChangeTM Kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, a pair of complementary primers 25–35 bases long was designed with the base pair changes located in the middle of the sequence. The DNA was amplified by PCR using Pfu-turbo polymerase, the parental strand was nicked by digestion with DpnI restriction endonuclease, and the mixture was transformed into competent BL21 E. coli(Stratagene). COS7 and Swiss 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Transfections of COS7 cells were carried out using the calcium phosphate precipitation methods as described previously (24Nikolic M. Chou M.M. Lu W. Mayer B.J. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1998; 395: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were transfected using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent following the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cortical and hippocampal neurons were obtained from embryonic stage (E) 17–19 rats. They were dissociated as described previously and cultured in Neurobasal media supplemented with factor B27, 2 mm l-glutamine, 0.06 mg/ml cysteine, and 1 mmsodium pyruvate (Life Technologies, Inc.) on poly-d-lysine and laminin-coated culture dishes at 37 °C and 5% CO2(24Nikolic M.

The following antibodies were used for immunocytochemical detection at the indicated dilutions: β-galactosidase (1:1000, Promega), Pak1 (C-19, 1:300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), tubulin (1:100, Sigma), and rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (1:25 Sigma). Phosphospecific antibodies PK-16 and PK-18 were obtained by immunization of mice with the following peptide (KRSVIEPLPVT(p)PTRDV), and the clones were selected on the basis of binding to the phosphorylated and not to the unphosphorylated form of this peptide (Sigma). The hybridoma supernatants were used at a 1:2 dilution and affinity-purified PK-18 at 1:250 dilution. Secondary antibodies were FITC-conjugated anti-mouse (1:150, Sigma) or Alexa 488-, Alexa 594-, and Alexa 633-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit (1:500–1:1000, Molecular Probes). Primary neurons were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde pre-warmed to 37 °C as described previously (5Nikolic M. Dudek H. Kwon Y.T. Ramos Y.F. Tsai L.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Images of neuronal growth cones and Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were collected using an Olympus fluoroview confocal microscope or Zeiss Axiovert and Openlab (Improvison) deconvoluting software, respectively. Neurons were examined using a Zeiss Axioscop microscope at ×25 magnification using a macro provided by Imaging Associates Ltd. Care was taken to examine isolated neurons to avoid false results. In all cases scoring was carried out exclusively within a radius of 100 μm from the center of the soma. For each cell, the number of neurite crossover points was counted. The scoring was performed blind. GST-fused proteins were isolated either from expressing E. coli or from transfected COS7 cells. In both cases cells were lysed in buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol), and the lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads for a minimum of 1 h at 4 °C. The proteins were eluted using 20 mm glutathione and dialyzed against cold phosphate-buffered saline for a minimum of 3 h. The following antibodies were used in all applications: Pak1 (C-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p35 (C-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Cdk5 (DC-17), Myc-tag (9e10), T(PO4)P (TP-101, New England Biolabs), Pak1T212(PO4) (PK18, P3232; Sigma), and GST (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For Pak1/p35/Cdk5 interactions, transiently transfected COS7 cells were lysed in STM-Nonidet P-40 buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, protease, and phosphatase inhibitors). Then the lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads at 4 °C, washed three times in buffer A, and resuspended in 1× sample buffer. Transfected COS7 cells were lysed in buffer A containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors for all other experiments. Cytoplasmic and membrane fractionations were obtained as described previously using STM and STM-Nonidet P-40 buffer (24Nikolic M. Chou M.M. Lu W. Mayer B.J. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1998; 395: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation using potato acid phosphatase was carried out as described previously (24Nikolic M. Chou M.M. Lu W. Mayer B.J. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1998; 395: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Pak1 and p35/Cdk5 kinase assays were performed as described previously after standardization for Pak1 expression using a phosphorimaging device and ECL Plus immunodetection reagent (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) (24Nikolic M. Chou M.M. Lu W. Mayer B.J. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1998; 395: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). When the 147–231 fragment was used, the GST tag was removed by thrombin cleavage as described previously (24Nikolic M. Chou M.M. Lu W. Mayer B.J. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1998; 395: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). For Pak1 in-gel kinase assays, immunoprecipitates were resolved on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.5 mg/ml myelin basic protein (Sigma). The gels were denatured in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride followed by sequential renaturing in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 0.04% Tween 20. The kinase reaction was performed in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 20 μm ATP, and 10 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP. p35/Cdk5 kinase assays were carried out as described previously (5Nikolic M. Dudek H. Kwon Y.T. Ramos Y.F. Tsai L.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) using p35/Cdk5 immunoprecipitates fromin vitro transcribed and translated preparations. The reactions were carried out in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5–1 μCi [γ-32P]ATP, and 1 μg of recombinant Pak1 proteins for 20 min at room temperature. Two-dimensional tryptic-phosphopeptide mapping was performed on purified GST-Pak1 proteins phosphorylated in vitro or in vivo by the p35/Cdk5 kinase. Phosphorylated bands were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane from which they were digested usingl-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin. After several cycles of purification, the samples were standardized using Cerenkov counting and dotted onto microcrystalline cellulose TLC plates followed by electrophoresis in pH 1.9 buffer (using a Hunter thin-layer electrophoresis unit) and chromatography in phospho-chromatography buffer as described previously (24Nikolic M. Chou M.M. Lu W. Mayer B.J. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1998; 395: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 61Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that Pak1 becomes phosphorylated when co-expressed with p35/Cdk5 in a RacGTP-dependent manner. Moreover, Pak1 is found in complex with p35/Cdk5 in wild type and not p35−/− mouse cortices (24Nikolic M. Chou M.M. Lu W. Mayer B.J. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1998; 395: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). To confirm that Pak1 is indeed phosphorylated by p35/Cdk5, we co-expressed both kinases in COS7 cells in the presence of an active Rac mutant, RacL61. Using a phosphospecific antibody that recognizes a minimal Cdk consensus site, phosphorylated threonine adjacent to a proline (T(PO4)P), we were able to show extensive Pak1 phosphorylation only in the presence of the p35/Cdk5 kinase (Fig.1A). When a Cdk5 dominant negative mutant was used (Cdk5N144), Pak1 phosphorylation was reduced to basal levels, indicating the requirement for Cdk5 kinase activity. Cdk5 is a member of the Cdk family of kinases shown to phosphorylate K(S/T)PX(K/R) motifs where X is preferably a basic amino acid while an acidic one is not tolerated well (38Beaudette K.N. Lew J.

Six are present in the spacer region that separates the GTPase binding and kinase domains, three are present in the kinase domain, and one is present at the extreme C terminus of Pak1 that associates with Gβ proteins (Fig. 1C) (42Leeuw T. Wu C. Schrag J.D. Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. Nature. 1998; 391: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 43Leberer E. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Leeuw T. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We therefore carried out in vitro p35/Cdk5 kinase assays using recombinant GST-fused Pak1 fragments as substrates. Fig.1D shows phosphorylation of a kinase-dead Pak1 mutant (Pak1R299) by p35/Cdk5 that had been obtained by in vitrotranscription and translation reactions. Interestingly, the region encompassing residues 147–231 was the best substrate and contains two putative targets, Thr-185 and Thr-212. Phosphorylation of 1–231 and 232–544 fragments was also observed. The 232–544 region contains the entire Pak1 kinase domain and was able to catalyze its own phosphorylation in the absence of the p35/Cdk5 kinase, consistent with the previously reported high levels of autophosphorylation (44Frost J.A. Khokhlatchev A. Stippec S. White M.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28191-28198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 45Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Chen X.Q. Chong C.

Chem. 1999; 274: 32565-32573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This was not observed for any other fragment of Pak1 (Fig.1E and data not shown). A Pak1 kinase-inactivating K299R mutation abolished any detectable phosphorylation of the 232–544 domain in the presence or absence of the p35/Cdk5 kinase, suggesting that the C terminus of Pak1 does not contain any p35/Cdk5 target sites. This was further confirmed by the inability of p35/Cdk5 to phosphorylate 232–442 and 443–544 fragments of Pak1 (Fig.1E). The GST-Pak1R299 phosphorylated in vitro by the p35/Cdk5 kinase, followed by trypsin digestion, generates a single radioactive peptide when separated in two dimensions (24Nikolic M. Chou M.M. Lu W. Mayer B.J. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1998; 395: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). To determine whether the Pak1 (S/T)P sites contribute to this phosphorylation, we mutated five (Thr-185, Thr-212, Thr-427, Thr-481, and Thr-531) to alanines in the Pak1R299 background to avoid additional Pak1 autophosphorylation. The mutant Pak1 proteins were expressed as GST fusions in COS7 cells, purified, and used in p35/Cdk5 in vitro kinase assays followed by digestion with trypsin and separation on thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates by electrophoresis and chromatography. Fig.2A shows that only the Pak1A212R299 mutant was rendered unphosphorylatable in vitro. To verify that Thr-212 phosphorylation is directly due to the activity of p35/Cdk5 and not another contaminating kinase, we performed a kinase assay using only recombinant proteins purified from E. coli. A truncated, active fragment of p35 (GST-p25) and GST-Cdk5 efficiently phosphorylated a fragment of Pak1 (147). This was prevented by a T212A mutation, indicating that Thr-212 is a direct target of the p35/Cdk5 kinase (Fig. 2B). To examine the regions of Pak1 that are targeted by the p35/Cdk5 kinase in vivo, we expressed GST-fused Pak1 fragments in COS7 cells in the presence or absence of p35, Cdk5, and RacL61. Pak1 was isolated from the transfectants and analyzed for the presence of phosphorylated TP residues by Western blotting using the anti-T(PO4)P antibody. The results revealed phosphorylation of only the N-terminal half of the protein, whereas the C terminus (residues 232–544) remained unphosphorylated (Fig.3A). The N-terminal phosphorylation mapped to the 147–231 region. To further verify the results obtained in vitro, we compared the phosphorylation pattern of five mutants (T185A, T212A, T427A, T481A, and T531A) generated in the Pak1R299 background following expression in COS7 cells in the presence or absence of p35, Cdk5, and RacL61. Western blots revealed that only the GST-Pak1A212R299 mutant lacked any detectable phosphorylation (Fig.3B). This was confirmed using a Myc-Pak1A212-expressing construct (data not shown). The results suggest that Thr-212 is also a major p35/Cdk5 target site in vivo, whereas Thr-185, Thr-427, Thr-481, and Thr-531 are not targeted by the kinase. The GST-Pak1R299 phosphorylated in COS7 cells labeled with [32P]orthophosphate resolves into several radioactive peptides upon digestion with trypsin and two-dimensional separation. One of the peptides co-migrates with the single in vitrolabeled peptide, suggesting that the site(s) targeted in vitro is also an in vivo substrate(s) (24Nikolic M. Chou M.M. Lu W. Mayer B.J. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1998; 395: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). To confirm that Thr-212 is indeed the major amino acid in Pak1 phosphorylated by p35/Cdk5 in vivo, we compared the patterns generated by the Pak1A212R299 mutant with two controls, Pak1R299 co-expressed with p35/Cdk5 or p35/Cdk5N144 and RacL61 in COS7 cells. Pak1R299 generated five distinct radioactive peptides, one of which (3Grant P. Sharma P. Pant H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1534-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) was absent from the T212A mutant (Fig. 3C). The phosphorylation of peptide 3 was also highly reduced in the presence of the inactive p35/Cdk5N144 kinase. Peptide 3 co-migrated with the single visiblein vitro phosphorylated Pak1 fragment (data not shown), suggesting that Thr-212 is the major target of the p35/Cdk5 kinase bothin vitro and in vivo. Peptides 1, 2, 4, and 5 were still evident in the Pak1A212R299 mutant, indicating that they were not due to Thr-212 phosphorylation. Interestingly, when Cdk5N144 was used, peptide 5 was also missing. These findings identify Thr-212 as the major p35/Cdk5 target site and the only phosphorylated amino acid on peptide 3. They also suggest that the p35/Cdk5 kinase may indirectly affect the phosphorylation of another site on Pak1 located on peptide 5. Pak1 kinase activity is inhibited by p35/Cdk5 (24Nikolic M. Chou M.M. Lu W. Mayer B.J. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1998; 395: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). To determine whether this is due to phosphorylation of Thr-212, we examined the kinase activity of Pak1A212. COS7 cells were engineered to over-express wild type Pak1, Ala-212, or Glu-212 mutants alone in the presence of RacL61 or p35, Cdk5, and RacL61. Pak1 immunoprecipitates were subjected to an in-gel kinase assay using myelin basic protein as a substrate. The results revealed that Pak1A212 could be activated by RacL61 to a similar level as the wild type control. Furthermore, this mutant was inhibited by the p35/Cdk5 kinase, indistinguishably from the wild type control (Fig. 4A). To confirm these findings, in vitro kinase assays were performed using histone H4 as a Pak1 substrate. The activation of Pak1A212 by RacGTP was again prevented by the presence of the p35/Cdk5 kinase (Fig. 4B). These data suggested that the p35/Cdk5 kinase-mediated inhibition of Pak1 activity is not due singly to phosphorylation of Pak1 on Thr-212 and were confirmed by the Pak1E212 mutant, the kinase activity of which was indistinguishable from wild type Pak1 or Pak1A212 (Fig. 4A). The results also raised the possibility that inhibition of Pak1 is an indirect consequence of the p35/Cdk5 kinase. The Pak1 region surrounding Thr-212 lies close to its autoinhibition domain. This domain overlaps in part with the Rac/Cdc42 binding region and is able to interact with the C-terminal kinase domain (45Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Chen X.Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Zenke F.T. King C.C. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol.

GST-Pak1 fragments were co-transfected with p35/Cdk5N144 and RacL61 in COS7 cells, and the glutathione pulldowns were examined for the presence of p35, Cdk5, and Rac. The dominant negative mutant of Cdk5 was used because it confers a more stable interaction with substrates partly by extending the half-life of p35 (49Patrick G.N. Zhou P. Kwon Y.T. Howley P.M.

https://openalex.org/W1979752294,"Transmitter release in neurons is thought to be mediated exclusively by high-voltage-activated (HVA) Ca(2+) channels. However, we now report that, in retinal bipolar cells, low-voltage-activated (LVA) Ca(2+) channels also mediate neurotransmitter release. Bipolar cells are specialized neurons that release neurotransmitter in response to graded depolarizations. Here we show that these cells express T-type Ca(2+) channel subunits and functional LVA Ca(2+) currents sensitive to mibefradil. Activation of these currents results in Ca(2+) influx into presynaptic terminals and exocytosis, which we detected as a capacitance increase in isolated terminals and the appearance of reciprocal currents in retinal slices. The involvement of T-type Ca(2+) channels in bipolar cell transmitter release may contribute to retinal information processing."
https://openalex.org/W2084119414,"Early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1) is a 170-kDa polypeptide required for endosome fusion in mammalian cells. The COOH terminus of EEA1 contains a FYVE domain that interacts specifically with phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns-3-P) and a Rab5 GTPase binding region adjacent to the FYVE domain. The dual interaction of EEA1 with both PtdIns-3-P and Rab5 has been hypothesized to provide the specificity required to target EEA1 to early endosomes. To test this hypothesis, we generated truncated (amino acids 1277–1411) and full-length EEA1 constructs containing point mutations in the COOH terminus that impair Rab5 but not PtdIns-3-P binding. These constructs localized to endosomes in intact cells as efficiently as their wild-type counterparts. Furthermore, overexpression of the truncated constructs, both wild-type and mutated, impaired the function of endogenous EEA1 resulting in the accumulation of small, untethered endosomes. These results suggest that association with Rab5 is not necessary for the initial binding and tethering functions of EEA1. A role for Rab5 binding was revealed, however, upon comparison of endosomes in cells expressing full-length wild-type or mutated EEA1. The mutant full-length EEA1 caused the accumulation of endosome clusters and suppressed the enlargement of endosomes caused by a persistently active form of Rab5 (Rab5Q79L). In contrast, expression of wild-type EEA1 with Rab5Q79L enhanced this enlargement. Thus, endosome tethering depends on the interaction of EEA1 with PtdIns-3-P, and its interaction with Rab5 appears to regulate subsequent fusion.

The specific mechanisms by which these steps are regulated by Rab5 is not fully understood, but the regulation of endosome fusion by Rab5 appears to be dependent on the actions of the cytoplasmic protein EEA1.1 EEA1 in turn has been postulated to mediate the obligatory docking or tethering steps required prior to homotypic endosome fusion, as well as to participate in the fusion process itself (3Christoforidis S.

To directly test this hypothesis we have identified critical residues required for the interaction of the EEA1 COOH-terminal domain with Rab5, and documented the effect of mutation of these residues on EEA1 localization and endosome fusion dynamics. The results shown here suggest a temporal order of events in which endosome tethering is mediated by the interaction of EEA1 with PtdIns-3-P and subsequent endosome fusion is dependent on the interaction of EEA1 with Rab5.

To prepare cytosolic extracts, cells were rinsed twice and swollen by incubation (10 min) in a 10-fold dilution of cytosol buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 125 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.2 m sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 0.01 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase with proteinase and phosphatase inhibitors) in water. Cells were homogenized by repeated passage through a 27-gauge needle and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. Supernatant was then separated from particulate structures by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 15 min for use in binding assays. In vitro binding of 10xHis-Rab5c to immobilized GST fusion proteins was performed as described previously (9Lawe D.C. Patki V. Heller-Harrison R. Lambright D. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3699-3705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Binding of cytosolic extracts from cells transfected with either GFP-1277wt or GFP-1277dm was performed as follows. 5 μg of GST-Rab5c fusion protein was bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads that had been preblocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). The beads were then incubated with 100 μmGTPγS or GDPβS in buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 30 °C for 30 min followed by the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 20 mm. Beads were then washed and incubated with 2.5 μg of cytosolic extract for 1 h at 4 °C in a final volume of 300 μl of cytosol buffer containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20. Following centrifugation, the pellets were washed four times in 1 ml of buffer A, 20 mmMgCl2, 0.1% Tween 20. Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, which was blocked in 5% dry milk, TBST followed by incubation with anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Filters were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Promega), which was detected by Renaissance enhanced luminol reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Liposome binding assays were performed as described previously (6Patki V. Virbasius J. Lane W.S. Toh B.H. Shpetner H.S. Corvera S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7326-7330Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) with minor modification. PS/PI liposomes were composed of 50% phosphatidylserine and 50% phosphatidylinositol (Avanti), whereas PI3P liposomes contained 1% PtdIns-3-P (Matreya), 50% phosphatidylserine, and 49% phosphatidylinositol. 2.5 μg of cytosolic extract from COS-7 cells transfected with either GFP-1277wt or GFP-1277dm were treated with 50 nm wortmannin for 5 min to inhibit endogenous PI3-kinase. These extracts were then incubated with liposomes (100 μmol total lipid) for 15 min at room temperature in a 100 μl final volume of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm MgCl2. After centrifugation, liposome pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an anti-GFP monoclonal antibody as described above. COS-7 cells were grown to 40–50% confluence on coverslips and transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. 24 h post-transfection, cells were either treated or untreated with 50 nm wortmannin for 10 min as indicated or incubated with Texas red-labeled transferrin (Molecular Probes) at a concentration of 25 μg/ml at 37 °C for the indicated time. Coverslips were then washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in 4% formaldehyde/PBS for 10 min at 4 °C, and imaged using a conventional wide-field microscope fitted with a 60× or 100× Nikon plan-apo objective. Images were acquired with a cooled CCD camera (Hamamatsu) and MetaMorph software. Coverslips labeled with antibody were fixed as described above followed by permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were then blocked with 1% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C and stained in the same buffer with a monoclonal antibody directed to the NH2 terminus of EEA1 (Transduction Laboratories). Anti-mouse antibody coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate was used to detect the primary antibody. To capture the information contained within the whole three-dimensional volume of the cell, 18 optical sections at a resolution of 200 nm/pixel and spaced at 250 nm intervals were taken. To remove out-of-focus blur from each section, image restoration was performed using a iterative constrained deconvolution algorithm described previously (10Carrington W.A. Lynch R.M. Moore E.D. Isenberg G. Fogarty K.E. Fay F.S. Science. 1995; 268: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Morphometric analysis of endosomes was done on three-dimensional images. Prior to analysis of each three-dimensional image, a threshold intensity was set so that 33% of the light in the image would be above threshold (this yielded a different threshold value for each three-dimensional image). All voxels (voxel = pixel3) below the threshold intensity were set to 0 (background). The light above threshold was considered the signal in the vesicles. A “vesicle” was defined as each group of contiguous, above threshold voxels. For live cell imaging COS-7 cells were transfected with EGFP-tagged constructs and after 24 h were imaged using high speed, three-dimensional microscopy (10Carrington W.A. Lynch R.M. Moore E.D.

The microscope was configured to 133 nm/pixels using a 60× objective, and the laser illumination was configured to provide a 488 nm excitation wavelength with a flux on specimen of ∼12 watts/cm2. Exposure times of 5 ms were used to acquire each of 18 optical sections, spaced by 250 nm. Each set of 18 optical sections was acquired in less than 1 s, allowing 20 ms for each 250-nm shift in focus. Stacks were acquired every 10 s for 20 continuous minutes. The haze originating from light sources outside the in-focus plane of the cell was reduced by image restoration. Stacks were projected into single two-dimensional images, which were concatenated into a QuickTime video format. To dissect the specific structural requirements for the interaction of EEA1 with Rab5, we built upon previous studies demonstrating that, whereas the FYVE domain of EEA1 is necessary and sufficient for its interaction with PtdIns-3-P, the FYVE domain and an additional stretch of 30 amino acids NH2-terminal to the FYVE domain are necessary for Rab5 binding (9Lawe D.C. Patki V. Heller-Harrison R. Lambright D. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3699-3705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The structure of this Rab5 binding region, a parallel coiled-coil homodimer depicted in Fig.1 A, was derived from the crystal structure of the EEA1 COOH-terminal region bound to inositol 1,3-diphosphate (28Dumas J.J. Merithew E. Sudharshan E. Rajamani D. Hayes S. Lawe D. Corvera S. Lambright D.G. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 947-958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This region contains three glutamine residues positioned on the outer surface of a helix, which may potentially contribute to the interaction of the COOH terminus of EEA1 with Rab5. To test this, we introduced point mutations converting these glutamine residues, singly or in combination, to alanine and then examined the ability of the resulting mutants to interact with Rab5in vitro. Mutation of glutamine 1328 to alanine substantially reduced, whereas mutation of glutamine 1338 virtually abolished, the interaction between the COOH terminus of EEA1 and Rab5. The combination of these two point mutations completely ablates Rab5 binding. Interestingly, mutation of glutamine 1335 significantly enhanced this interaction (Fig.1 B). None of the point mutations altered the function of the FYVE domain as assessed by liposome binding assays (not shown). Thus, these mutations result in a selective impairment of the interaction of EEA1 with Rab5. To examine how the inability of EEA1 to bind Rab5 would influence its membrane localization, the subcellular localization of GFP-tagged constructs encoding the wild-type COOH terminus of EEA1 (GFP-1277wt) or the COOH terminus harboring glutamine to alanine mutations in amino acids 1328 and 1338 (GFP-1277dm) was investigated. Both constructs efficiently localized to endosomes (Fig.2 A, left panels). In both cases, treatment of cells with the PI3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin (Fig. 2 A, right panels) or LY49653 (not illustrated) abolished binding to endosomal membranes. To confirm that the expressed proteins indeed differentially interact with Rab5, cytosolic extracts of cells expressing either GFP-1277wt or GFP-1277dm were incubated with immobilized GST-Rab5. To asses the function of the FYVE domain, similar extracts were incubated with liposomes containing PtdIns-3-P. Bound material was analyzed by immunoblotting with antibody to GFP. Although there was no difference in the ability of these constructs to associate with PtdIns-3-P liposomes in vitro, the mutant was deficient in Rab5 binding (Fig. 2 B), indicating that the endosomal localization of the COOH terminus of EEA1 is mediated through its interaction with PtdIns-3-P and is independent of its interaction with Rab5. It is important to note, however, that the FYVE domain of EEA1 alone (amino acids 1336–1411) is not sufficient for endosome localization in vivo (9Lawe D.C. Patki V. Heller-Harrison R. Lambright D. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3699-3705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This is most likely due to the inability of the FYVE domain to oligomerize rather than to specific loss of Rab5 binding. In support of this, sedimentation equilibrium experiments demonstrate that the FYVE domain alone (amino acids 1336–1411) is monomeric in solution, whereas the longer COOH-terminal construct, which contains a region of coiled-coil, forms dimers crucial for high affinity membrane binding (not illustrated). It has been shown that overexpression of the EEA1 COOH terminus results in the formation of unusually small early endosomes and blocks endosome enlargement induced by the GTPase-deficient Rab5, Rab5Q79L (4Simonsen A. Lippe R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Toh B.H. Murphy C. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Membrane localization is required for this effect, as point mutation of the FYVE domain within this construct restores the Rab5Q79L-induced endosome enlargement (14Gaullier J.M. Ronning E. Gillooly D.J. Stenmark H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24595-24600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that EEA1 functions downstream of Rab5 in endosome fusion because of this effect. To examine the requirement for the EEA1-Rab5 association in this assay, RFP-tagged Rab5Q79L was co-transfected into COS-7 cells with either GFP-1277wt or GFP-1277dm. Both GFP proteins co-localized with Rab5Q79L on endosomal membranes (Fig. 3,left) and when overexpressed blocked the enlargement induced by Rab5Q79L (Fig. 3, right). This would indicate that the inhibitory effect of the EEA1 COOH terminus on Rab5-induced endosome enlargement occurs independently of its direct interaction with Rab5 and is most likely due to the inability of these deletion constructs to allow endosome tethering to occur. Thus, although EEA1-mediated tethering is crucial for endosome fusion, this function of EEA1 is independent of its interaction with Rab5. If both membrane localization and EEA1-mediated tethering are independent of Rab5 association, the physiological role of the interaction between EEA1 and Rab5 remains unknown. To attempt to elucidate this role, we examined the effects of overexpressing full-length wild-type (GFP-EEA1wt) or mutated (GFP-EEA1dm) EEA1 on endosome function in COS-7 cells. To confirm that the expressed proteins indeed differentially interact with Rab5, cytosolic extracts of cells expressing either construct were incubated with immobilized GST-Rab5. This experiment was necessary, as the NH2-terminal domain of EEA1 has been reported to be capable of binding Rab5 in vitro (3Christoforidis S. McBride H.M. Burgoyne R.D. Zerial M. Nature. 1999; 397: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). However, our experiments indicate that the Q1328A and Q1338A mutation greatly impaired the binding of full-length EEA1 to Rab5 (Fig.4). The small residual binding observed is likely to be because of the oligomerization of some of the mutant EEA1 with the wild-type endogenous molecule (15Callaghan J. Simonsen A. Gaullier J.M. Toh B.H. Stenmark H. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, the contribution of the NH2 terminus of EEA1 to Rab5 binding appears to be minimal in these experiments. GFP-EEA1wt was localized mainly in single vesicular structures distributed throughout the cytoplasm, with an area of concentration toward the perinuclear region where larger, ring-like endosomes could be seen (Fig. 5, left panels). In contrast, GFP-EEA1dm was found in large clusters distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 5, right panels). These clusters represent tightly packed individual endosomes, clearly visible in the enlarged inset region. Similar endosome clustering has been observed in vitro under conditions in which SNARE priming is impaired (3Christoforidis S. McBride H.M. Burgoyne R.D. Zerial M. Nature. 1999; 397: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Thus, the accumulation of nonfused endosome clusters in cells overexpressing GFP-EEA1dm suggests a role for the interaction between EEA1 and Rab5 in the regulation of endosome fusion following tethering. We next examined the dynamic behavior of endosomes in living cells expressing GFP fusion proteins of wild-type or mutant full-length EEA1. GFP-EEA1wt was present on endosomes of varying diameter, many of which had a characteristic ring-like appearance, probably because of their relatively large, spherical morphology combined with the optical properties of the wide-field microscope. These ring-like endosomes have been observed by immunofluorescence of endogenous EEA1 in several different cell types (16Wilson J.M. de Hoop M. Zorzi N. Toh B.H. Dotti C.G. Parton R.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2657-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The dynamic behavior of a group of such endosomes in a cell expressing GFP-EEA1wt is illustrated in Fig.6 A. In this sequence, three endosomes appear to come into close proximity with each other, form a tight cluster, and fuse into a single, larger structure. Comparison of the radius of the smaller and large final endosomes indicates an increase consistent with the fusion of three smaller endosomes into one. In cells expressing GFP-EEA1dm, these fusion events were not observed. Instead, clusters of four or more large endosomes were abundant, and these failed to fuse within the imaging time frame (Fig.6 B). These results suggest that the inability of Rab5 to bind the mutant EEA1 protein results in a decrease in the efficiency of homotypic endosome fusion. To further test this hypothesis, we analyzed the behavior of endosomes in cells co-expressing RFP-Rab5Q79L and either GFP-EEA1wt or GFP-EEA1dm. As expected, expression of RFP-Rab5Q79L resulted in the formation of enlarged endosomes, an effect that was significantly enhanced by co-expression of GFP-EEA1wt (Fig.7, upper panels). In contrast, coexpression of GFP-EEA1dm blocked the endosome enlargement induced by RFP-Rab5Q79L (Fig. 7, lower panels). These results suggest that the direct binding of Rab5 to the COOH terminus of EEA1 is required for endosome fusion at a step subsequent to tethering. To assess the functional consequences of the altered endosome fusion dynamics induced by overexpression of EEA1 constructs, the trafficking of Texas red-transferrin was analyzed (Fig.8). When nontransfected cells or cells expressing GFP-EEA1wt were incubated with Texas red-transferrin for 40 min, intense transferrin fluorescence was detected in a tight pericentriolar region, which represents the recycling endosome. When the intensity scale was set so as not to saturate the signal in the pericentriolar region, the transferrin signal was virtually undetectable in the GFP-containing endosomes. In contrast, after a similar uptake period, the transferrin signal detected in the pericentriolar region of cells expressing GFP-EEA1dm was comparable with that detected in GFP-containing endosomes, indicating a delay in traffic to the pericentriolar recycling endosome. In cells expressing GFP-1277wt, in which endosome tethering is impaired, little transferrin signal was detected in the recycling endosome after a 40-min uptake, and extensive co-localization of Texas red-transferrin and GFP-1277wt was observed. These results suggest that the transit of transferrin through the early endosome to the recycling endosome is facilitated by EEA1-mediated endosome tethering and by fusion events that require the direct interaction between EEA1 and Rab5. To rule out that any of the observed phenotypes were due to the insertion of a GFP-tag, cells expressing nontagged full-length EEA1wt and EEA1dm were analyzed. Transfected cells could be identified by the increase in fluorescence intensity after staining with anti-EEA1 antibody. Neither the number nor the size distribution of endosomal structures in cells expressing EEA1wt at up to 15 times over the endogenous level (Fig. 9) differed appreciably from nontransfected cells. Cells overexpressing EEA1dm at similar levels (5–15 times over endogenous level) differed from those overexpressing EEA1wt in that enlarged particles were observed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 9 B). These particles represent endosome clusters, as no single, large lumen was observed. Thus, the introduction of the GFP tag on the EEA1 NH2terminus appears not to alter its function measurably. Furthermore, these results support the hypothesis that the accumulation of vesicle clusters is due to the impairment of EEA1 binding to Rab5. The process of endocytosis in eukaryotic cells plays a fundamental role in the control of cellular homeostasis. Through endocytosis, cells accumulate critical nutrients and regulate the surface complement of receptors. Thus, understanding the molecular basis of the endocytic process has been an important goal for cell biologists for many years.In vitro assays that measure the ability of endosomes containing exogenously added labels to fuse with each other have been used extensively to identify and characterize key elements involved in endosome fusion. Using these assays, the activities of PI3-kinase and of the GTPase Rab5 were found to be essential for endosome fusionin vitro (17Li G. D'Souza-Schorey C. Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Klippel A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 18720-18722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The discovery that EEA1 can interact with both PtdIns-3-P, a product of PI3-kinase, and activated Rab5 suggested that it may be an effector protein for these regulatory molecules. A model consistent with available results has been proposed in which PtdIns-3-P and Rab5 function cooperatively to recruit EEA1 to early endosomes (3Christoforidis S. McBride H.M. Burgoyne R.D. Zerial M. Nature. 1999; 397: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 4Simonsen A. Lippe R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Toh B.H. Murphy C. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar), where EEA1 then interacts with SNARE proteins to mediate endosome fusion ((20Simonsen A. Gaullier J.M. D'Arrigo A. Stenmark H.

Cell. 1999; 98: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The goal of the present work was to test this model and to more precisely define the respective roles of the interactions between EEA1 and PtdIns-3-P and EEA1 and Rab5 in endosome function. The results shown here indicate that the interaction of EEA1 with PtdIns-3-P is necessary and sufficient for binding to endosomal membranes. Once bound, EEA1 may serve to link Rab5 activity to the machinery that regulates homotypic endosome fusion. In vitro, EEA1 has been shown to interact with Rab5 through two regions, one immediately adjacent to the FYVE domain and an additional NH2-terminal binding site (3Christoforidis S. McBride H.M. Burgoyne R.D. Zerial M. Nature. 1999; 397: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). However, mutation of the FYVE domain of EEA1 completely abolishes its interaction with endosomes (8Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.H. D'Arrigo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24048-24054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), suggesting that the NH2-terminal binding domain is not likely to play a significant role in endosome bindingin vivo. Furthermore, overexpression of the NH2terminus of EEA1 lacking the FYVE domain does not compete for binding of endogenous EEA1 to endosomes (not shown). Results shown here indicate that although wild-type EEA1 bound immobilized Rab5, EEA1 constructs containing two point mutations adjacent to the FYVE domain did not (Fig. 4). Thus, the physiological significance of the in vitro interaction of the NH2 terminus of EEA1 with Rab5 remains to be determined. Despite the failure of mutant EEA1 constructs to interact with Rab5, these constructs bound to endosomes to an extent indistinguishable from the wild-type constructs and in a wortmannin-sensitive manner. The most logical interpretation of these data is that the interaction of EEA1 with Rab5 is not required for the initial binding of EEA1 to early endosome membranes. What then is the role for the interaction between EEA1 and Rab5? Results shown here suggest that this interaction is required to regulate homotypic endosome fusion. Two lines of evidence support this hypothesis. First, endosomes in cells expressing the full-length mutant are found frequently in clusters, reminiscent of the clustered, unfused structures seen in yeast upon disruption of Vps9p (22Gerrard S.R. Bryant N.J. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 613-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 23Burd C.G. Mustol P.A. Schu P.V. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2369-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for Vps21p, which is a homologue of Rab5 (24Hama H. Tall G.G. Horazdovsky B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15284-15291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Second, the potent effect of persistently active mutants of Rab5 to accumulate large endosomes is impaired in cells expressing the full-length EEA1 mutant that cannot bind Rab5. These experiments suggest that Rab5 cooperates with EEA1 in the regulation of endosome fusion after EEA1 has bound. This model is consistent with genetic evidence in yeast for the molecular organization of an analogous pathway; Vac1p, the yeast orthologue of EEA1/Rabenosyn5, associates with the Rab5 homologue Vps21p and with Vps45p, a Sec1 homologue that binds and regulates the activity of the yeast SNARE Pep12p. In this system, the requirement for the GTPase is subsequent to membrane tethering. The results presented here also raise a number of important issues. One in particular is that endosomes from cells expressing wild-type, mutant, or truncated EEA1, although morphologically distinct, all accumulate transferrin. Thus, the traffic of transferrin receptor from the plasma membrane to early endosomes that contain EEA1 does not appear to depend on the function of EEA1. The only consequence of disrupted EEA1 function on transferrin traffic appears to be a delay in the movement of transferrin from early endosomes into the perinuclear recycling compartment. The finding that transferrin traffic into endosomes occurs independently of EEA1 function is consistent with the inability of wortmannin, a potent PI3-kinase inhibitor, to inhibit transferrin uptake (25Spiro D.J. Boll W. Kirchhausen T. Wessling-Resnick M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 355-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 26Martys J.L. Wjasow C. Gangi D.M. Kielian M.C. McGraw T.E. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10953-10962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thus, much more work is required to elucidate the mechanisms that control the vectorial delivery of plasma membrane-derived vesicles to endosomes. In conclusion, the results presented here, derived from experiments in intact cells, suggest a model for the spatial and temporal order of key biochemical events in early endosome fusion. In this model, tethering and fusion are regulated by the sequential interaction of EEA1 with PtdIns-3-P, to mediate tethering, and with Rab5, to mediate fusion. The requirement for tethering factors acting in conjunction with Rab GTPases in other membrane transport steps (27Waters M.G. Hughson F.M. Traffic. 2000; 1: 588-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) suggests that interactions similar to those presented here may temporally and spatially control multiple intracellular trafficking pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2022456060,"Eukaryotes express both copper/zinc (SOD1)- and manganese (SOD2)-requiring superoxide dismutase enzymes that guard against oxidative damage. Although SOD1 acquires its copper through a specific copper trafficking pathway, nothing is known regarding the intracellular manganese trafficking pathway for SOD2. We demonstrate here that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells delivery of manganese to SOD2 in the mitochondria requires the Nramp metal transporter, Smf2p. SOD2 activity is greatly diminished insmf2Δ mutants, even though the mature SOD2 polypeptide accumulates to normal levels in mitochondria. Treatingsmf2Δ cells with manganese supplements corrected the SOD2 defect, as did elevating intracellular manganese through mutations in PMR1. Hence, manganese appears to be inaccessible to mitochondrial SOD2 in smf2 mutants. Cells lacking SMF2 also exhibited defects in manganese-dependent steps in protein glycosylation and showed an overall decrease in steady-state levels of accumulated manganese. By comparison, mutations in the cell surface Nramp transporter, Smf1p, had very little impact on manganese accumulation and trafficking. Smf2p resides in intracellular vesicles and shows no evidence of plasma membrane localization, even in anend4 mutant blocked for endocytosis. We propose a model in which Smf2p-containing vesicles play a central role in manganese trafficking to the mitochondria and other cellular sites as well."

Experiments were performed to evaluate the expression of HuA and tristetraprolin in purified human T lymphocytes and to evaluate the ability of these proteins to recognize specific AU-rich sequences. HuA is a predominantly nuclear protein that can also be found in the cytoplasm of resting T lymphocytes. Within 1 h after stimulation of T lymphocytes with anti-T cell receptor antibodies or a combination of a phorbol myristate acetate and ionomycin, an increase in cytoplasmic HuA RNA-binding activity was observed. Although absent in resting cells, cytoplasmic tristetraprolin protein was detected 3–6 h following activation. HuA recognized specific AU-rich sequences found in c-jun or c-myc mRNA that were poorly recognized by tristetraprolin. In contrast, tristetraprolin recognized an AU-rich sequence in interleukin-2 mRNA that was poorly recognized by HuA. Both HuA and tristetraprolin, however, recognized AU-rich sequences from c-fos, interleukin-3, tumor necrosis factor-α, and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor mRNA. HuA may transiently stabilize a subset of AU-rich element-containing transcripts following T lymphocyte activation, and tristetraprolin may subsequently mediate their degradation.

HuA recognized specific AU-rich sequences found in c-jun or c-myc mRNA that were poorly recognized by tristetraprolin. In contrast, tristetraprolin recognized an AU-rich sequence in interleukin-2 mRNA that was poorly recognized by HuA. Both HuA and tristetraprolin, however, recognized AU-rich sequences from c-fos, interleukin-3, tumor necrosis factor-α, and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor mRNA. HuA may transiently stabilize a subset of AU-rich element-containing transcripts following T lymphocyte activation, and tristetraprolin may subsequently mediate their degradation. AU-rich element untranslated region tumor necrosis factor-α interleukin-2 interleukin-3 granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor tristetraprolin phorbol myristate acetate and ionomycin anti-T cell receptor antibody Immune cellular activation, proliferation, and effector function require precise control of growth regulatory genes. For example, T lymphocyte activation induces transient expression of a defined pattern of early response growth regulatory genes, including proto-oncogenes and cytokine genes (1Ullman K.S. Northrop J.P. Verweij C.L. Crabtree G.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 421-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). After normal cellular activation, these growth regulatory genes are expressed for a defined period and then their expression is turned off. Failure to turn off the expression of many of these genes has been associated with malignancy (2Merup M. Med. Oncol. 1998; 15: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 3Pearson P.L. Van der Luijt R.B. J. Intern. Med. 1998; 243: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms by which expression of early response genes are turned off includes selective degradation of early response gene mRNA. Many of these mRNA transcripts contain conserved AU-rich elements (AREs)1 in their 3′-untranslated region (UTR), which allow these transcripts to be distinguished from other transcripts and thereby be selectively regulated (4Caput D. Beutler B. Hartog K. Thayer R. Brown-Shimer S. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1670-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar, 5Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3103) Google Scholar). These AREs have been implicated as selective regulators of mRNA localization (6Veyrune J.L. Campbell G.P. Wiseman J. Blanchard J.M. Hesketh J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1185-1194PubMed Google Scholar), translation (7Kruys V. Marinx O. Shaw G. Deschamps J. Huez G.

Med. 1990; 171: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), and degradation (5Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3103) Google Scholar). Thus, a given ARE may serve multiple regulatory functions. The observation that AREs function as instability elements was first demonstrated by Shaw and Kamen in 1986 (5Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3103) Google Scholar), when they showed that introduction of a 51-nucleotide AU-rich sequence from the granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) 3′-UTR into the 3′-UTR of rabbit β-globin mRNA conferred instability on the otherwise stable β-globin mRNA. Since then, AREs from numerous early response gene transcripts have been shown to function as instability elements (for reviews, see Refs. 9Malter J.S. Adv. Immunol. 1998; 68: 1-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Jacobson A. Peltz S.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 693-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 11Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar) and have been classified according to their sequence features and degradation kinetics (11Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar, 12Xu N. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4611-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Class I AREs contain dispersed copies of the sequence motif AUUUA found in the context of other U-rich sequences. This class of AREs is found mostly in transcripts from nuclear transcription factors and proto-oncogenes such as c-fos or c-myc. Class II AREs contain tandemly reiterated copies of the AUUUA sequence motif such as is found in the 3′-UTRs from the cytokine genes tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-3 (IL-3), and GM-CSF. In contrast, class III AREs, such as the ARE from c-jun, do not contain the AUUUA motif but rather contain other U-rich sequences. Although AREs appear to target early response gene transcripts for degradation, ARE-containing transcripts may be differentially regulated based on the class of ARE they contain (12Xu N. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4611-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which AREs regulate mRNA degradation is largely unknown but is thought to involve trans-acting factors that selectively regulate the deadenylation and subsequent degradation of ARE-containing transcripts (10Jacobson A. Peltz S.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 693-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 11Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). Numerous trans-acting factors have been identified in crude cellular extracts that bind to AU-rich RNA sequences in vitro (13Bohjanen P.R. Petryniak B. June C.H. Thompson C.B. Lindsten T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3288-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 14Vakalopoulou E. Schaack J. Shenk T. Mol. Cell.

The function of only a small subset of these proteins has been examined. One of these proteins, AUF-1, binds to the AREs from a variety of genes, including cytokine genes and proto-oncogenes (17Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2460-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), and the binding affinity of recombinant AUF-1 for a panel of AU-rich sequences correlated with the ability of these sequences to function as instability elements (26DeMaria C.T. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12179-12184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Members of the ELAV family of RNA-binding proteins also bind to AREs. This family consists of the tissue-specific RNA-binding proteins HuB, HuC, and HuD, as well as the ubiquitously expressed protein HuA (27Keene J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar,28Good P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4557-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). HuA is a predominantly nuclear RNA-binding protein that shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (29Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15293-15298Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Recombinant HuA has been shown to stabilize ARE-containing transcripts in vitro (30Ford L.P. Watson J. Keene J.D. Wilusz J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 188-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), and overexpression of HuA (31Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3448-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 32Levy N.S. Chung S. Furneaux H. Levy A.P. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3461-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) or HuB (34Jain R.G. Andrews L.G. McGowan K.M. Pekala P.H. Keene J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 954-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) results in stabilization of ARE-containing transcripts in vivo. Tristetraprolin (TTP) is another cloned ARE-binding protein that appears to play a role in ARE-mediated mRNA degradation. TNF-α is overproduced in macrophages from TTP knock-out mice through stabilization of TNF-α mRNA, and overexpression of TTP results in decreased accumulation of ARE-containing transcripts (25Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar), suggesting that TTP may mediate degradation of these transcripts. Because HuA and TTP have opposite effects on the stability of ARE-containing transcripts, it is possible that their opposing activities may constitute a homeostatic post-transcriptional mechanism to control gene expression. Our work has focused on understanding the role of mRNA stability in the regulation of T lymphocyte activation. Experiments were performed to examine expression of HuA and TTP in purified human T lymphocytes and to examine the ability of these proteins to bind to a variety of T lymphocyte-derived AU-rich sequences from early response gene transcripts. We found that, although HuA was present in cytoplasmic extracts from resting T lymphocytes, its RNA-binding activity increased rapidly, within 1 h, following T lymphocyte activation. In contrast to HuA, TTP was not present in cytoplasmic extracts from resting T lymphocytes. TTP was induced following T lymphocyte activation later than HuA, with detectable protein levels occurring 3–6 h after T lymphocyte activation. We also found that HuA and TTP had distinct but overlapping RNA-binding specificities. In particular, HuA and TTP both bound to AU-rich sequences found in the 3′-UTR of the T lymphocyte transcripts c-fos, IL-3, TNF-α, and GM-CSF. Following T lymphocyte activation, HuA may bind to these transcripts early, thereby stabilizing them and allowing them to be expressed, and TTP may subsequently displace HuA and target them for degradation. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from buffy coat white blood cell packs obtained from the American Red Cross by centrifugation through a Ficoll-Hypaque (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) cushion. Red blood cells were further removed by hypotonic lysis, and monocytes and B cells were removed based on their binding to anti-immunoglobulin-coated glass beads using T cell enrichment columns (R&D Systems). The resulting cell population usually consisted of 90–95% T lymphocytes based on flow cytometry using anti-T cell receptor (anti-CD3) antibodies. These cells were cultured overnight in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. In some experiments, T lymphocytes were stimulated with 10 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate and 0.4 μg/ml ionomycin (P+I) or with 1 μg/ml immobilized anti-CD3 antibody (R&D Systems) with or without 1 μg/ml soluble anti-CD28 antibody (R&D Systems) as described previously (13Bohjanen P.R.

HeLa cells were grown in monolayers in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared by lysing cells in a buffer containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 40 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 8 ng/ml aprotinin, 2 ng/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 mmPMSF. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 2 min in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge, and cytoplasmic extracts were immediately frozen on dry ice and were stored at −80 °C. The protein concentration of the extracts was determined by a colorimetric assay using a commercially available reagent (Bio-Rad) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Unless indicated otherwise, RNA transcripts were synthesized from linearized plasmid templates using T7 RNA polymerase as described previously (15Bohjanen P.R. Petryniak B. June C.H. Thompson C.B. Lindsten T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6302-6309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeled transcripts were prepared by inclusion of [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) in the reaction, and the resulting RNA had a specific activity of ∼8 × 107 cpm/μg. After cleavage with ribonuclease T1, the GM-CSF ARE probe had the sequence UAUUUAUUUAUUUAUUUAUUUACUCG, and the M1 probe had the sequence UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCUCG. RNA oligonucleotides were purchased commercially (Dharmacon Research) and were used as probes or competitors in some experiments. Table I shows the sequences of the RNA oligonucleotides used. These RNA oligonucleotides were gel-purified and quantified based on their optical density at 260 nm. In some experiments, radiolabeled RNA oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) using T4 polynucleotide kinase, producing probes with a specific activity of ∼4 × 106 cpm/μg.Table IRelative ability of RNA sequences to compete for binding by HuA and TTPHuATTPc-fosUAUUUAUAUUUUUAUUUUAUUU++++++c-junUAUUUCUUGUUUGUUUGUUUGGGUAU++++c-myc-1UUACCAUCUUUUUUUUUCUUUA++++c-myc-2AAUUUUAAGAUUUACACAAUGU−−IL-2UAUUUAUUUAAAUAUUUAAAUUUUAUAUUUAU++++IL-3UAUUUAUUUAUGUAUUUAUGUAUUUAUUUAUUUAU++++++TNF-αUAUUUAUUAUUUAUUUAUUAUUUAUUUAUUUA++++++GM-CSFAUUUAUUUAUUUAUUUAUUUA++++++M1UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU+++−M8ACUCACUCACUCACUCACUCA−− Open table in a new tab Cytoplasmic extracts were incubated with a radiolabeled RNA probe at room temperature for 30 min in a buffer containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 40 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 3 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol in the presence of 1 unit/μl ribonuclease T1 (Calbiochem) and 5 mg/ml heparan sulfate (Sigma). Unless indicated otherwise, each reaction contained 8 μg of cytoplasmic protein and 8 fmol of radiolabeled RNA probe in a total volume of 24 μl. Ribonuclease T1 was omitted from the reaction if end-labeled RNA and cold oligonucleotides were used. The reaction mixtures were irradiated with 254-nm ultraviolet light using a Stratalinker ultraviolet (UV) cross-linking apparatus (Stratagene) and were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried and were analyzed on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The anti-HuA antiserum (36Atasoy U. Watson J. Patel D. Keene J.D. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3145-3156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. Jack D. Keene at Duke University Medical Center. This antiserum was generated by immunizing a rabbit with recombinant murine HuA protein. Pre-immune serum from this rabbit was used as a control. The anti-TTP antiserum was obtained from Dr. Perry J. Blackshear (NIEHS, National Institutes of Health). This antiserum was derived from a rabbit that was immunized against recombinant human TTP. These antibodies were coated onto protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma), and the beads were washed. RNA-protein UV cross-linking reactions were performed as described above and were incubated with antibody-coated beads for 2 h on a rotator at 4 °C in a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 40 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol. The beads were separated from the supernatants by centrifugation, and the beads were washed four times in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS. Material from the supernatants or the beads was separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by autoradiography on film or a PhosphorImager. Total cellular RNA was prepared from unstimulated or stimulated human T cells using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s directions. The RNA samples were separated by electrophoresis on formaldehyde-agarose gels (20 μg of RNA/lane) and were blotted onto Duralon membranes (Stratagene). The membranes were hybridized sequentially with a32P-labeled 1.4-kb murine TTP cDNA probe (25Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase DNA probe (Ambion). After hybridization, blots were washed and analyzed using a PhosphorImager. Cytoplasmic extracts containing 30 μg of protein were separated by electrophoresis and were electroblotted onto Immobilon P membranes (Millipore). These membranes were probed with an anti-TTP antiserum or with a commercially available anti-actin antibody (Calbiochem). The ECL system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) was used to visualize antibody binding to the membrane. HeLa cells grown in monolayers in tissue culture plates were transfected for 6 h using the Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) with the pCMV.TTP.Tag expression plasmid, which encodes the full-length human TTP cDNA linked to a hemagglutinin tag (25Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pCDNA-3 plasmid (Invitrogen) or the pCH110 β-galactosidase expression plasmid (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) were used as mock controls. After an additional 24 h, the cells were harvested, cytoplasmic extracts were prepared, and RNA-protein UV cross-linking assays were performed as described above. A set of ARE-binding activities, termed AU-A, AU-B, and AU-C, were identified previously in cytoplasmic extracts from purified human T lymphocytes using an RNA-protein UV cross-linking assay (13Bohjanen P.R. Petryniak B. June C.H. Thompson C.B. Lindsten T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3288-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 15Bohjanen P.R. Petryniak B. June C.H. Thompson C.B. Lindsten T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6302-6309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As seen in Fig.1 A, the AU-A activity present in cytoplasmic extracts from unstimulated T lymphocytes was found to UV cross-link to an AU-rich sequence found in the 3′-UTR of GM-CSF mRNA (lane 1), whereas the AU-B and AU-C activities were found only in extracts from activated T lymphocytes (lane 7). AU-A has striking biochemical similarities to the HuA protein; both are ubiquitously expressed predominantly nuclear proteins that shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (13Bohjanen P.R. Petryniak B. June C.H. Thompson C.B. Lindsten T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3288-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 29Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and they have similar molecular weights and RNA-binding specificities (13Bohjanen P.R. Petryniak B. June C.H. Thompson C.B. Lindsten T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3288-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 14Vakalopoulou E. Schaack J. Shenk T. Mol. Cell.

Therefore, immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out to determine whether the AU-A activity was attributable to the HuA protein. UV cross-linking reactions were performed using cytoplasmic extracts from unstimulated T lymphocytes and the GM-CSF ARE probe. After UV cross-linking, immunoprecipitations were performed with control, anti-HuA-coated, or anti-TTP-coated beads. As seen in Fig.1 B, anti-HuA-coated beads specifically immunoprecipitated AU-A from extracts from unstimulated T lymphocytes (lane 5), whereas beads coated with pre-immune rabbit serum (lane 4) or anti-TTP antiserum (lane 6) did not. In addition, anti-HuA-coated beads specifically depleted AU-A from the supernatants (lane 2). Specific and quantitative depletion of AU-A from UV cross-linking reactions performed with extracts from unstimulated T lymphocytes was observed in three independent experiments. The marked similarities between AU-A and HuA (13Bohjanen P.R. Petryniak B. June C.H. Thompson C.B. Lindsten T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3288-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 14Vakalopoulou E. Schaack J. Shenk T. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) together with the immunoprecipitation data presented here strongly suggest that the AU-A RNA-binding activity can be attributed to the HuA protein. Experiments were performed to determine whether cytoplasmic HuA activity was regulated following T lymphocyte activation. The AU-A (HuA) RNA-binding activity could be distinguished from the AU-B and AU-C RNA- binding activities based upon different RNA-binding specificities. As seen in Fig. 1 A (lanes 2–6), AU-A (HuA) activity present in extracts from unstimulated cells was competed with a 22-nucleotide poly(U) sequence (M1 RNA). In contrast, concentrations of competitor M1 RNA that completely inhibited AU-A (HuA) binding had little or no effect on binding by AU-B or AU-C (compare lanes 4–6 to lanes 10–12). Thus, the M1 sequence could be used as a radiolabeled probe to assess HuA binding in isolation, without interference from the AU-B or AU-C activities. As seen in Fig. 2 A, HuA RNA-binding activity in cytoplasmic extracts was increased 6 h after T lymphocyte stimulation with a combination of phorbol myristate acetate and ionomycin (P+I) or with an anti-T cell receptor antibody (α-CD3). Evaluation of actin expression by Western blot in duplicate samples demonstrated that the increase in HuA activity was not because of an error in sample quantification (lower panel). The increase in HuA activity following T lymphocyte activation has been observed in more than 10 independent experiments. Interestingly, the increase in cytoplasmic HuA activity occurred very rapidly, within 1 h, following T lymphocyte stimulation with P+I (Fig. 2 B) or anti-CD3 (data not shown). The induced RNA-binding activity in the cytoplasm seen in Fig. 2 (A and B) is attributable to HuA because all of the induced activity was immunoprecipitated and immunodepleted by anti-HuA serum (Fig. 2 C). Because HuA is known to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (29Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15293-15298Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), it is possible that the rapid increase in cytoplasmic HuA activity is caused by redistribution of HuA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Given the inducible expression of TTP in macrophages and its role in regulating TNF-α and GM-CSF expression (25Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 38Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Blood. 2000; 95: 1891-1899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we postulated that TTP could also be a regulator of cytokine expression in T lymphocytes. Therefore, experiments were performed to evaluate TTP mRNA expression in T lymphocytes. Total cellular RNA from T cells that were unstimulated or were stimulated for 30, 60, or 90 min with P+I was used to prepare Northern blots that were hybridized with a murine TTP cDNA probe. Although only low levels of TTP mRNA were observed in unstimulated T cells, TTP mRNA was rapidly induced within 30 min of stimulation and was decreasing toward basal levels within 90 min (Fig. 3 A). TTP mRNA levels were also induced by anti-CD3 stimulation (data not shown). The time course of induction of HuA in T lymphocytes is similar to the induction of TTP mRNA in macrophages following stimulation with TNF or lipopolysaccharide (25Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot experiments were also performed to determine whether the increased TTP mRNA levels correlated with increased TTP protein expression. As seen in Fig. 3 B, T cell activation for 6 h with P+I or a combination of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies led to increased TTP protein expression. TTP protein expression was transient following anti-CD3 stimulation, appearing within 3 h and decreasing to near base-line levels within 12 h (Fig. 3 C). The kinetics of TTP expression parallels the expression of cytokine transcripts following T lymphocyte activation (39Thompson C.B. Lindsten T. Ledbetter J.A. Kunkel S.L. Young H.A. Emerson S.G. Leiden J.M. June C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1333-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that TTP could be a regulator of T lymphocyte cytokine expression. Because TTP protein was present in cytoplasmic extracts from activated T lymphocytes, experiments were performed to determine whether this TTP protein possessed RNA- binding activity. As was seen in Fig. 1 A, P+I stimulation induced the expression of two ARE-binding activities, referred to as AU-B and AU-C, that were detected using a UV cross-linking assay. Unlike HuA (AU-A) activity, these activities were not competed using M1 competitor RNA. UV cross-linking reactions using extracts from P+I-stimulated T lymphocytes and the GM-CSF ARE probe were immunoprecipitated with control, anti-TTP-coated, or anti-HuA-coated beads (Fig.4 A). Anti-HuA-coated beads immunoprecipitated AU-A (lane 5), as was seen previously (Fig. 2), whereas anti-human TTP-coated beads immunoprecipitated two proteins (lane 6) that corresponded to the AU-B and AU-C ARE binding activities (15Bohjanen P.R.

https://openalex.org/W1509952659,"Two yeast enzymes, Psd1p and Psd2p, catalyze the decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine to produce phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn). Mitochondrial Psd1p provides ∼90% of total cellular phosphatidylserine decarboxylase activity. When thePSD1 gene is deleted, the resultant strain(psd1Δ) grows normally at 30 °C in glucose and in the absence of exogenous choline or ethanolamine. However, at elevated temperature (37 °C) or on the nonfermentable carbon source lactate, the growth of psd1Δ strains is minimal without ethanolamine supplementation. The reduced growth and viability correlate with a PtdEtn content below 4% of total phospholipid. These results suggest that there is a critical level of PtdEtn required to support growth. This theory is supported by growth data revealing that a psd1Δ psd2Δ dpl1Δ strain can only grow in the presence of ethanolamine. In contrast, a psd1Δ psd2Δ strain, which makes low levels of PtdEtn from sphingolipid breakdown, can be rescued by ethanolamine, choline, or the ethanolamine analogue propanolamine. psd1Δ psd2Δ cells grown in 2 mm propanolamine accumulate a novel lipid, which was determined by mass spectrometry to be phosphatidylpropanolamine (PtdPrn). PtdPrn can comprise up to 40% of the total phospholipid content in supplemented cells at the expense of phosphatidylcholine and PtdEtn. The absolute level of PtdEtn required for growth when PtdPrn is present appears to be 1% of the total phospholipid content. The essential function of the PtdEtn in the presence of propanolamine does not appear to be the formation of hexagonal phase lipid, insofar as PtdPrn readily forms hexagonal phase structures detectable by31P NMR."
https://openalex.org/W2061768568,"Molecular mechanisms underlying long-term neurotrophic regulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity are unknown. We report here that long-term treatment of neuromuscular synapses with glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) potentiates spontaneous and evoked transmitter release, in ways very similar to presynaptic expression of the Ca(2+) binding protein frequenin. GDNF enhances the expression of frequenin in motoneurons, and inhibition of frequenin expression or activity prevents the synaptic action of GDNF. GDNF also facilitates Ca(2+) influx into the nerve terminals during evoked transmission by enhancing Ca(2+) currents. The effect of GDNF on Ca(2+) currents is blocked by inhibition of frequenin expression, occluded by overexpression of frequenin, and is selective to N-type Ca(2+) channels. These results identify an important molecular target that mediates the long-term, synaptic action of a neurotrophic factor."
https://openalex.org/W1503606784,"Crystallographic studies have elucidated the binding mechanism of forskolin and P-site inhibitors to adenylyl cyclase. Accordingly, computer-assisted drug design has enabled us to identify isoform-selective regulators of adenylyl cyclase. After examining more than 200 newly synthesized derivatives of forskolin, we found that the modification at the positions of C6 and C7, in general, enhances isoform selectivity. The 6-(3-dimethylaminopropionyl) modification led to an enhanced selectivity for type V, whereas 6-[N-(2-isothiocyanatoethyl) aminocarbonyl] and 6-(4-acrylbutyryl) modification led to an enhanced selectivity for type II. In contrast, 2′-deoxyadenosine 3′-monophosphate, a classical and 3′-phosphate-substituted P-site inhibitor, demonstrated a 27-fold selectivity for inhibiting type V relative to type II, whereas 9-(tetrahydro-2-furyl) adenine, a ribose-substituted P-site ligand, showed a markedly increased, 130-fold selectivity for inhibiting type V. Consequently, on the basis of the pharmacophore analysis of 9-(tetrahydro-2-furyl) adenine and adenylyl cyclase, a novel non-nucleoside inhibitor, 2-amino-7-(2-furanyl)-7,8-dihydro-5(6H)-quinazolinone (NKY80), was identified after virtual screening of more than 850,000 compounds. NKY80 demonstrated a 210-fold selectivity for inhibiting type V relative to type II. More importantly, the combination of a type III-selective forskolin derivative and 9-(tetrahydro-2-furyl) adenine or NKY80 demonstrated a further enhanced selectivity for type III stimulation over other isoforms. Our data suggest the feasibility of adenylyl cyclase isoform-targeted regulation of cyclic AMP signaling by pharmacological reagents, either alone or in combination."

The endocytic machinery comprises two major structural proteins, clathrin and the adapter protein complex AP2, which plays a central role in CP assembly. A number of more recently identified cytosolic or integral-membrane proteins regulate CP formation and the fission of clathrin-coated vesicles. In the conventional view of constitutive endocytosis, readily accessible tyrosine- or di-leucine-based endocytic motifs, present in the cytoplasmic tails of membrane proteins that are to be internalized, interact with the AP2 adapter complex. In the case of ligand-induced endocytosis, these endocytic signals are cryptic and thought to be unmasked upon receptor activation by its cognate ligand (1Marsh M. McMahon H.T.

Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 175-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), represent a different model of ligand-induced endocytosis through CPs due to their use of specific adapter proteins called β-arrestins that form a bridge between activated GPCRs and the clathrin coat (5Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Endocytosis of GPCRs plays an important role in the regulation of their signaling cycle (6Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Agonist-stimulated GPCRs initiate cell responses by modulating effector molecules via the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins. These receptors are then rapidly phosphorylated by specific kinases. This phosphorylation promotes the binding of cytosolic nonvisual arrestins (β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2) to GPCRs (7Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar) resulting in their desensitization (8Bouvier M. De Hausdorff W.P. Blasi A. O'Dowd B.F. Kobilka B.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

A. 1986; 83: 2797-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), a transient state during which receptors become refractory to any further stimulation. To recover a full signaling function, GPCRs have to be internalized (10Staehelin M. Simons P. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), dephosphorylated in the endosomal compartment (11Krueger K.M. Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Previous studies have indicated that nonvisual arrestins play the role of adapter molecules during this process (14Goodman O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). The overexpression of arrestins can rescue an endocytosis-defective mutant of the β2-adrenergic receptor, a member of the GPCR family and the overexpression of dominant negative forms of arrestins inhibits GPCR internalization (15Ferguson S.S. Downey W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). In addition, activated GPCR-arrestin complexes concentrate in punctate areas of the plasma membrane where they colocalize with clathrin (14Goodman O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V.

Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar) and AP2 (19Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Zhang J. Holt J.A. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3712-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) provided a potential mechanism by which GPCRs are internalized through CPs. In this model, arrestins recruit activated GPCRs into CPs by connecting the cytosolic domain of GPCRs to clathrin-coat components. Recent studies confirmed this scenario by showing that mutants of β-arrestin2 lacking the AP2 binding motif are unable to efficiently recruit activated GPCRs into CPs (17Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23120-23126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). A commonly proposed paradigm for receptor-mediated endocytosis is that the endocytic machinery is recruited to the inner face of the plasma membrane from the cytoplasm by cytoplasmic tails of membrane proteins (nucleation) (20Brodsky F.M. Science. 1988; 242: 1396-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 21Pearse B.M. Crowther R.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1987; 16: 49-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In the case of ligand-activated receptors, such as GPCRs, this would occur after stimulation, permitting CP formation at random sites on the plasma membrane through the association of individual coat components. Recent evidence, however, has challenged this model of nucleation and suggests that regulation of CP levels is independent of endocytic signal levels. In these studies transferrin receptors (22Warren R.A. Green F.A. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2116-2121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) or chimeric integral membrane reporter proteins containing cytoplasmic endocytic signals (23Santini F. Marks M.S. Keen J.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1177-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) were expressed to levels that saturated the internalization machinery, but no evidence to suggest a change in CP levels was found. In addition CPs have been shown to exhibit limited mobility within the membrane and form repeatedly at distinct sites or “hot spots” (24Gaidarov I. Santini F. Warren R.A. Keen J.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In the model of pre-existing CPs, the receptor would perhaps be mobilized to these sites upon activation. To investigate this issue in a model of GPCR endocytosis we studied arrestin translocation and redistribution of receptor-arrestin complexes in CPs during the early stages of ligand-mediated endocytosis of the rat thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor-1 (TRHR). In particular, we have conducted dynamic studies in living cells expressing a β-arrestin 2-enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) and a chimera between Eps15, a constitutive component of CPs (25Tebar F.

Our results show that agonist-activated TRHRs do not promote the formation of specific coated pits. Instead, receptor-arrestin complexes are recruited to pre-existing sites of constitutive endocytosis. Cell culture media and fetal bovine serum were from Life Technologies.

Angers) using NheI and cloning this into theNheI site of EGFPN1 (CLONTECH). pβ-Arrestin1-EGFP was generated by excising theXhoI/SacII fragment (containing amino acids 1–414 of bovine β-arrestin1) from pBC.β-arrestin (7Lohse M.J.

The PCR product was digested with BamHI and HindIII and cloned into pGEX5.1-Eps15ΔP/C- (32Benmerah A. Poupon V. Cerf-Bensussan N. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Biol.

The full-length Eps15ΔP/C cDNA was then excised from pGEX5.1-Eps15ΔP/C-2 using BamHI/XhoI and subsequently introduced downstream and in frame of DsRed using theBglII/SalI sites of pDsRed1C1 (CLONTECH). Constructs were verified by nucleotide sequencing (Institut Cochin de Génétique Moléculaire sequencing facility). Sequences of the primers used to make RFP-Eps15 are available on request. HeLa cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. Subconfluent HeLa cells were used for transient expression of the different constructs. Transfections were performed using the FuGENE 6 Transfection System according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunofluorescence studies, HeLa cells were seeded on coverslips in six-well plates, transfected with 2 μg of VSV-TRHR and 0.2 μg β-arrestin2-GFP the following day, and used for immunofluorescence 1 day post-transfection. Cells were fixed and processed for fluorescence microscopy as described previously (32Benmerah A. Poupon V. Cerf-Bensussan N. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3288-3295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Endocytosis of Alexa594-conjugated Tf was performed on HeLa cells grown on coverslips 1 day after transfection. The cells were first incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in DMEM 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, to eliminate receptor-bound Tf and then incubated in DMEM 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin containing 100 nmAlexa594-conjugated Tf. After incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, the cells were rapidly cooled to 4 °C, washed twice in cold PBS, and then fixed as described above. Samples were examined either under an epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss) attached to a cooled CCD camera (Spot 2, Diagnostic Instruments) or under a confocal microscope (LSM 510, Zeiss). HeLa cells stably expressing β-arrestin2-GFP were generated by standard procedures using G418 (600 μg/ml) selection. Subconfluent HeLa cells stably expressing β-arrestin2-GFP in 10-cm cell culture dishes were transiently transfected with 10 μg VSV-TRHR using FuGENE 6. 48 h after transfection the cells were incubated with TRH at 37 °C for 2 or 5 min as indicated in the figure legend. Following the appropriate treatments, cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold PBS and detached using 10 mm EDTA in PBS. After pelleting at 1000 ×g, cells were resuspended in PBS containing CompleteTM protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Homogenization was performed by six passes through a ball-bearing homogenizer (cell cracker EMBL) with a clearance of 10 μm. Crude membranes were prepared by centrifugation at 45,000 × g in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor for 20 min. Insoluble fractions were collected and resolved by electrophoresis on 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto Immobilon (Millipore) membranes. Western blot analysis was performed using monoclonal antibodies specific for either AP2 (100/2, 1 in 2000 dilution) or GFP (1 in 1000 dilution). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were visualized using a chemiluminescent detection system (Pierce). Quantification of bands was performed using NIH Image 1.62 software. For real-time imaging purposes, HeLa cells were seeded on coverslips in six well plates, transfected the following day with 2 μg of VSV-TRHR, 0.2 μg of β-arr2-GFP and 0.2 μg RFP-Eps15, and used for imaging 2 days post-transfection. Cells on coverslips were mounted on the imaging chamber and maintained in Hepes-buffered medium at 37 °C. The cells were observed with a laser scanning confocal microscope (Bio-Rad MRC 1024) using a 40× oil immersion objective and electronic zoom of 2. Images were acquired sequentially every 5 s using simultaneous excitation at 488 and 568 nm. 10 μm TRH was applied directly over the selected cells following acquisition of the second image. The images were analyzed using LaserSharp 3.2 software. Internalization of TRHR was performed essentially as described in Ref. 33Groarke D.A. Drmota T. Bahia D.S. Evans N.A. Wilson S. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar. Briefly, subconfluent HeLa cells in 10-cm cell culture dishes were transiently transfected with 10 μg of VSV-TRHR and 1 μg of β-arrestin2-GFP using FuGENE 6. 24 h after transfection cells were trypsinized and seeded into 12-well plates (one 10-cm dish was split into 18 wells). The day after, DMEM was removed from the cells and replaced with 0.5 ml Hepes-buffered DMEM (HD medium: serum-free DMEM, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2) per well, and cells were incubated at 37 °C. 40 min later, plates were placed on ice and cooled for 10 min. HD medium was removed and replaced with 200 μl of 40 nm [3H]TRH in HD medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and cells were incubated on ice for 40 min. Subsequently plates were shifted to 37 °C for 60, 30, 20, 15, 10, 5, 2, or 1 min, replaced on ice, and washed three times with ice-cold 0.15 m NaCl. Immediately after, membrane-bound [3H]TRH was stripped with 0.5 ml of an acid/salt wash (0.2 m acetic acid, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 2.6) followed by 0.5 ml of 0.15 m NaCl wash. Internal [3H]TRH was determined after cell solubilization with 1% (w/v) SDS/1% (v/v) Triton X-100/10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0. Samples incubated in the presence of 10 μm cold TRH allowed the determination of nonspecific binding. Results are expressed as a percentage of surface receptors at 0 min (cells incubated on ice for the duration of the experiment). To investigate the issue of whether ligand-activated GPCRs can initiate the formation of new CPs or whether they are recruited to pre-existing CPs, we utilized a system that would result in a high density of internalized GPCR following receptor activation. To this end, we chose to study HeLa cells overexpressing a vesicular stomatitis virus epitope-tagged form of TRHR (VSV-TRHR). Previous studies have demonstrated that the TRHR is endocytosed by a β-arrestin- (33Groarke D.A. Drmota T. Bahia D.S. Evans N.A. Wilson S. Milligan G. Mol.

This GPCR was chosen, as in preliminary experiments using real-time confocal microscopy it was found to be one of the best GPCR translocators of β-arrestins to the plasma membrane among several GPCRs tested including the β2-adrenergic receptor, the receptor for the chemoattractant formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, and the chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR5 (data not shown). In addition, the TRHR also belongs to the recently described class of GPCRs, which forms stable complexes with both β-arrestins1 and -2 and traffics together with β-arrestins in endocytic vesicles (37Oakley R.H.

VSV-TRHR was cotransfected in combination with a chimeric protein, consisting of the rat β-arrestin2 cDNA fused to the NH2-terminal end of GFP (β-arrestin2-GFP). In this system the endocytosis rate of the TRHR (t½ of ∼10 min, Fig. 1a) is similar to that obtained in rat pituitary GH4C1 cells expressing endogenous TRHR (38Petrou C.P. Tashjian Jr., A.H. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The cellular distribution of TRHR and β-arrestin2 was analyzed by immunofluorescence: VSV-TRHR was detected using the P5D4 monoclonal antibody specific to the VSV-tag, and β-arrestin2-GFP was directly visualized by the green fluorescence emitted by GFP. This approach therefore allowed us to observe a TRH-dependent membrane recruitment of β-arrestin2 as described previously in other cell systems. Previous studies have reported that β-arrestin-GFP chimeras maintain their function in receptor endocytosis (39Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) and may be used as markers of GPCR endocytosis (37Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G.

To determine whether β-arrestin and TRHR traffic together as a complex after receptor stimulation in our model, their relative cellular distributions were studied by immunofluorescence microscopy. The images shown focus on the plasma membrane of cells that are adherent to the coverslip as described previously (32Benmerah A. Poupon V. Cerf-Bensussan N. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3288-3295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Under basal conditions, β-arrestin2 displayed a characteristic diffuse cytosolic distribution (39Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) (Fig.1b), whereas the TRHR was evenly distributed at the cell surface (Fig. 1c). Following TRHR stimulation by TRH for 2 min, β-arrestin2 (Fig. 1d) translocated to the plasma membrane as a punctate staining. The TRHR also displayed a punctate staining at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1e) that completely colocalized with β-arrestin2. Following longer term stimulation (15 min), β-arrestin2 (Fig. 1f) and TRHR (Fig. 1g) were found colocalized in internal endosomal structures, demonstrating their continued presence in a shared endocytic pathway. β-Arrestin2 could therefore be used as a marker of TRHR in this model to follow its cell trafficking upon activation, as reported previously by Groarkeet al. (34Groarke D.A. Wilson S. Krasel C. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23263-23269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), in HEK-293 cells. This approach was preferred, in this study, instead of the direct labeling of TRHR with GFP, because it avoids any potential artifact that could arise from the fusion of GFP to the COOH-terminal tail of the receptor. To determine whether the punctate areas where β-arrestin2 and TRHR colocalize at early times of receptor stimulation correspond to CPs, we revealed the localization of AP2 complexes using the anti-AP-2, AP6 antibody. The cellular distribution of β-arrestin2 relative to AP2 under basal conditions and after TRHR stimulation was thus monitored. In untreated cells, AP2 displayed a punctate staining (Fig.2b) characteristic of plasma membrane CPs (18Santini F. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Benovic J.L. Keen J.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2463-2470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Santini F. Marks M.S. Keen J.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1177-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 32Benmerah A. Poupon V.

Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and β-arrestin2 demonstrated a diffuse cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 2a). There was no colocalization of the two different proteins under these conditions. Two minutes after TRHR activation, however, β-arrestin2 (Fig. 2c) was found to be completely colocalized with AP2 (Fig. 2d). Similar results were also observed with other specific CP markers, Eps15 (Fig.2, e and f) and clathrin (data not shown). In an attempt to quantify this colocalization, the number of β-arrestin2-GFP and AP2 immunofluorescent dots in a defined area in the same cells 2 min after TRHR stimulation were counted. We counted more than 250 AP2 dots from four different preparations and found no significant difference in the number of β-arrestin2 dots. In addition, each β-arrestin dot was found to correspond to an AP2 dot. These results indicate that following TRHR stimulation, β-arrestin2 and TRHR are mobilized to CPs and that all CPs contained β-arrestin2 in agreement with studies investigating β2-adrenergic receptor redistribution (16Cao T.T. Mays R.W. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24592-24602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In contrast, at later time points (15 min; Fig. 2, g and h) there was a loss of β-arrestin2-GFP colocalization with AP2 due to movement of the TRHR/β-arrestin2 complex to the endosomal compartment (see Fig.3, lower panel).Figure 3β-Arrestin2-GFP is redistributed to areas of active constitutive endocytosis with transferrin receptor and transferrin after TRHR activation.HeLa cells were transiently co-transfected with VSV-TRHR and β-arrestin2-GFP constructs.

In control cells, the TfR displayed a punctate staining due to its concentration in CPs (Fig. 3b), and β-arrestin2 demonstrated a diffuse cytosolic staining (Fig. 3a). Following activation of TRHR, β-arrestin2 was found to colocalize with most TfR clusters, indicating that the TRHR-β-arrestin2 complex mobilizes to the same areas of the membrane where TfR are undergoing constitutive endocytosis. This is in agreement with studies investigating the GPCR protease-activated receptor-1 in HeLa cells, which indicate a greater than 90% colocalization of protease-activated receptor-1 with TfR following short term stimulation of protease-activated receptor-1 (43Trejo J. Altschuler Y. Fu H.W. Mostov K.E. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31255-31265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The localization of β-arrestin following longer TRHR stimulation was also investigated using Alexa-594-labeled transferrin to stain the early/recycling endosomal compartment. At these later times β-arrestin was colocalized with transferrin in perinuclear regions of the cell (Fig. 3, lower panel, 15 min TRH, yellow color) in agreement with results obtained in HEK-293 cells (33Groarke D.A. Drmota T. Bahia D.S. Evans N.A. Wilson S. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Significant cytosolic pools of clathrin and AP2 exist in cells that are often equivalent to or exceed membrane-bound forms (23Santini F. Marks M.S. Keen J.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1177-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,44Goud B. Huet C. Louvard D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 45Chakrabarti R. Joly M.

Chem. 1989; 264: 12568-12572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the nucleation model of GPCR endocytosis, agonist activation of receptor would promote CP formation, and this would be expected to result in an increase of total CPs. This would result in a recruitment of AP2 from the cytosolic to the plasma membrane pool giving an increase in AP2 levels at the membrane. We used three different approaches to investigate if the TRHR is targeted to pre-existing CPs or initiates CP assembly upon activation. First, the number of CPs (as revealed by AP2 dots) was counted in a defined area of the plasma membrane in cells expressing TRHR and β-arrestin2-GFP in control (unstimulated) cells and after TRHR stimulation. No difference was found in the number of CPs following stimulation, indicating a lack of novel CP formation (Fig.4a). For the second approach HeLa cells stably expressing β-arrestin2-GFP were used. These cells were transiently transfected with VSV-TRHR. Crude membrane fractions of unstimulated and stimulated cells (2 and 5 min) were prepared, followed by SDS-PAGE resolution and immunoblotting with an antibody against the α chain of AP2. We could detect no difference in the levels of membrane or soluble AP2 after stimulation using this approach (Fig. 4,b and c, and data not shown), whereas in the same samples a clear increase in membrane β-arrestin2-GFP was observed (Fig. 4, d and e) with a corresponding decrease in the soluble fraction (not shown). These data are not consistent with the idea that β-arrestin drives the formation of de novoCPs upon TRHR activation but do agree with the model in which the receptor-β-arrestin complex is mobilized to pre-existing CPs. Finally, to confirm that β-arrestin2 is recruited to pre-existing CPs using a dynamic in vivo assay, we utilized a triple transfection model in which β-arrestin2-GFP and VSV-TRHR were co-expressed in combination with RFP-Eps15. Eps15 is a constitutive component of CPs (25Tebar F. Sorkina T. Sorkin A. Ericsson M. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28727-28730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 26van Delft S. Schumacher C. Hage W. Verkleij A.J. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) but not clathrin-coated vesicles (47Cupers P. Jadhav A.P. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1847-1850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and could therefore be used as a marker of “pre-existing” CPs,i.e. CPs present before TRHR stimulation. RFP-Eps15 consists of the Eps15 cDNA lacking amino acids 763–896 (EΔP/C), which is targeted to CPs and does not interfere with CP assembly (32Benmerah A. Poupon V. Cerf-Bensussan N. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3288-3295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) fused to the COOH terminus of the newly identified RFP from Discosoma sp. As expected, RFP-Eps15 displayed a bright membrane punctate staining (Fig. 5) that colocalized with both AP2 and clathrin (not shown). This enabled the concomitant monitoring of β-arrestin2-GFP and CPs by real-time confocal immunofluorescence microscopy in living cells following ligand activation of TRHR. Using this approach we predicted that pre-existing CPs shown by RFP-Eps15 that were present before TRHR stimulation would also be stained with β-arrestin2-GFP after TRH stimulation if β-arrestin is recruited to pre-existing CPs. However, if the nucleation of CPs was driven by the TRHR- β-arrestin complex we expected that novel RFP-Eps15 areas containing β-arrestin2-GFP would appear following TRHR stimulation. An acquisition of the cells was taken every 5 s following receptor stimulation. After as little as 10–20 s β-arrestin2-GFP could begin to be seen to colocalize with RFP-Eps15-stained areas of the membrane (Fig. 5, upper panel, 10–20 s) that were present before stimulation and after 25–30 s (Fig. 5, upper panel, 25–30 s) was completely colocalized with these regions. We observed no novel RFP-Eps15-stained areas of the membrane following receptor stimulation. These results therefore clearly indicate that β-arrestin2 is translocated to pre-existing CPs upon TRHR stimulation. Similar results were obtained using a β-arrestin1-GFP chimera (Fig. 5, lower panel). Taken together the data provide compelling evidence that the TRHR-β-arrestin complex does not initiate the novel formation of CPs, but that it is mobilized to pre-existing CPs. This model agrees with studies, which indicate that CPs do not form at sites of FcepsilonRI receptor activation (42Santini F. Keen J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies using a GFP-labeled form of clathrin light chain indicate that CP formation occurs repeatedly at defined sites or hot spots on the plasma membrane of cultured cells while excluding other areas (24Gaidarov I. Santini F. Warren R.A. Keen J.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The same phenomenon exists in synapses where the endocytic machinery for synaptic vesicle recycling is found localized at membrane-associated hot-spots surrounding areas of exocytosis (48Roos J. Kelly R.B. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1411-1414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The fact that GPCRs do not promote the nucleation of “de novo” CPs may explain why their endocytosis is saturable in some cell types even in the presence of overexpressed β-arrestin (49Marullo S. Faundez V. Kelly R.B. Receptors Channels. 1999; 6: 255-269PubMed Google Scholar), the limiting factor being the amount of constitutive CPs where GPCRs may be recruited through β-arrestin. In conclusion, therefore, the current study provides novel insights into the regulation of TRHR endocytosis, which directly demonstrates for the first time that a GPCR-β-arrestin complex is targeted to pre-existing CPs. Since the majority of GPCRs studied so far undergo ligand- and β-arrestin-dependent endocytosis, this model is of potential interest for other GPCRs.Figure 5β-Arrestin-GFP is targeted to pre-existing areas of CP formation following TRHR stimulation.Real-time visualization of β-arrestin2- and β-arrestin1-GFP translocation to CPs in live HeLa cells, transiently expressing VSV-TRHR, RFP-Eps15, and either β-arrestin2- or β-arrestin1-GFP, in response to stimulation with 10 μm TRH.

Here we demonstrate that functional uncoupling between CD38 and Cx43 in CD38-transfected 3T3 murine fibroblasts is paralleled by decreased [Ca2+]i levels as a result of reduced intracellular conversion of NAD+ to cADPR. A sharp inverse correlation emerged between [Ca2+]i levels and NAD+ transport (measured as influx into cells and as efflux therefrom), both in the CD38+ cells (high [Ca2+]i, low transport) and in the CD38− fibroblasts (low [Ca2+]i, high transport). These differences were correlated with distinctive extents of Cx43 phosphorylation in the two cell populations, a lower phosphorylation with high NAD+ transport (CD38− cells) and vice versa (CD38+ cells). Conversion of NAD+-permeable Cx43 to the phosphorylated, NAD+-impermeable form occurs via Ca2+-stimulated protein kinase C (PKC). Thus, a self-regulatory loop emerged in CD38+ fibroblasts whereby high [Ca2+]i restricts further Ca2+mobilization by cADPR via PKC-mediated disruption of the Cx43-CD38 cross-talk.

Its known enzyme activities are synthesis from NAD+ of nicotinamide and of the potent calcium mobilizer cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR)1 (ADP-ribosyl cyclase) and degradation of cADPR to ADP-ribose (cADPR hydrolase); in addition, CD38 has been demonstrated to catalyze a number of base-exchange reactions that include conversion of NADP+, in specific conditions and in the presence of nicotinic acid, to an additional calcium mobilizer, i.e. NAADP+ (4Aarhus R.

This property raised a number of obvious questions on: (i) how the cyclase substrate NAD+can become accessible to the catalytic site of CD38 at the outer surface of many cells, and (ii) even assuming ectocellular cADPR generation, how the CD38 product cADPR can reach the intracellular ryanodine-sensitive channels from which it releases calcium into the cytosol (12Lee H.C.

Physiol. 1996; 207: F469-F475Google Scholar). The latter question was also supported by failure to identify any functional effect of cADPR other than its intracellular calcium releasing activity. Similar topological questions arose for that fraction of CD38 which is localized to intracellular membrane vesicles. These mediate the export of “de novo” synthesized CD38 to the plasma membrane (16Zocchi E. Daga A. Usai C. Franco L. Guida L. Bruzzone S. Costa A. Marchetti C. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8017-8024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and also the opposite process of CD38 endocytosis that is observed upon incubating several cells types with specific ligands,e.g. GSH and N-acetylcysteine (17Zocchi E. Franco L. Guida L. Piccini D. Tacchetti C. De Flora A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Zocchi E. Usai C. Guida L. Franco L. Bruzzone S. Passalacqua M. De Flora A. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In both cases, the active site of CD38 is intravesicular and therefore unavailable to cytosolic NAD+. Moreover, any intravesicularly generated cADPR would be sequestered inside the vesicles and therefore be unable to target the ryanodine-sensitive calcium stores. This “topological paradox” of the CD38/cADPR system appeared to be challenging, in view of the powerful calcium releasing activity of cADPR and of the remarkably increased cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]i) levels (and consequent triggering of calcium-stimulated cell functions) that are observed during bothde novo expression of CD38 (16Zocchi E.

Chem. 1998; 273: 8017-8024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and its ligand-induced internalization (18Zocchi E. Usai C. Guida L. Franco L. Bruzzone S. Passalacqua M. De Flora A. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Both findings clearly indicated, in the absence of obvious underlying mechanisms, that intracellularly localized CD38 (e.g. vesicle-bound) can in fact convert cytosolic NAD+ to cADPR and that the cyclic nucleotide is functionally active as it can have accessibility to the calcium stores from which it up-modulates calcium release (19De Flora A. Franco L. Guida L. Bruzzone S. Usai C. Zocchi E. Chem. Immunol. 2000; 75: 79-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Recently, three different transporters for NAD+ and cADPR have been identified, which have elucidated the topological paradox of ectocellular CD38 and provided a complex model system, whereby intracellular calcium homeostasis can be regulated: (i) connexin 43 (Cx43) hemichannels proved to mediate the passive, regulated release of NAD+ from many cells, thus potentially providing the substrate to CD38+ cells for subsequent, ectocellular cADPR generation (20Bruzzone S. Guida L. Zocchi E. Franco L. De Flora A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 10-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar); (ii) transmembrane CD38 itself is an active transporter of catalytically generated cADPR, thus allowing cADPR to cross the cell membrane and to reach the intracellular calcium stores (21Franco L. Guida L. Bruzzone S. Zocchi E. Usai C. De Flora A. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1507-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar); (iii) cADPR can permeate directly across the plasma membrane of some cells, through a still molecularly undefined, yet CD38-unrelated, transport system (22Franco L. Zocchi E. Usai C. Guida L. Bruzzone S. Costa A. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21642-21648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A direct interplay between Cx43 and CD38 is thus sufficient to promote an enhanced trafficking of NAD+(release)/cADPR (influx) across the plasma membrane. That this functional cross-talk between CD38 and Cx43 exists also in the intracellular environment was suggested, but not yet demonstrated, by the sustained increases of [Ca2+]i that are elicited by ligand-dependent endocytosis of CD38 (18Zocchi E. Usai C. Guida L. Franco L. Bruzzone S. Passalacqua M. De Flora A. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 19De Flora A. Franco L. Guida L. Bruzzone S. Usai C. Zocchi E. Chem. Immunol. 2000; 75: 79-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, CD38 and Cx43 could functionally interact in the exocytotic/endocytotic membrane vesicles which generate and release cADPR into the cytosol with subsequent calcium mobilization. Based on these data, we addressed the occurrence of a functional interplay between Cx43 and CD38, by investigating their specific roles in the regulation of intracellular calcium. The results of this study indicated that both Cx43 and CD38 play a pivotal role in the vesicle-mediated intracellular trafficking of NAD+ which allows substrate availability to CD38 and accordingly cADPR generation. Moreover, it became clear that availability of NAD+ to CD38 which, if unrestricted, could damage the cell via perturbation of calcium homeostasis and NAD+ depletion, is feedback regulated by [Ca2+]i. The increase of the [Ca2+]i as induced by intracellular cADPR production, activates protein kinase C (PKC) which phosphorylates Cx43, resulting in its strongly decreased permeability to cytosolic NAD+ and therefore in functional disruption of the [Ca2+]i-regulating Cx43-CD38 cross-talk. Cx43 antisense (5′-CTCCAGTCACCCATGTCTG-3′) oligodeoxynucleotide, complementary to the AUG translation start codon region of murine Cx43 mRNA, and the corresponding sense (5′- CAGACATGGGTGACTGGAG-3′) oligodeoxynucleotide were purchased from Life Technology Italia (Milan, Italy). [3H]cADPR was prepared enzymatically from [3H]NAD+ (40 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Science, Milan, Italy) with recombinant ADP-ribosyl cyclase from Aplysia californica (courtesy of Prof. H. C. Lee) and HPLC purified (23Podestà M. Zocchi E. Pitto A. Usai C. Franco L. Bruzzone S. Guida L. Bacigalupo A. Scadden D.T. Walseth T.F. De Flora A. Daga A.

Two different antibodies were used for cytofluorimetric analyses of Cx43 (Zymed Laboratories Inc. Laboratories, San Francisco, CA): a polyclonal rabbit antibody reactive with both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of Cx-43 (catalog number 71-700, Ref. 24Nagy J.I. Li W.E.I. Roy C.

All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma (Milan, Italy). NIH 3T3 cells were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD) and cultured as described (16Zocchi E. Daga A. Usai C. Franco L. Guida L.

Transfection with sense (CD38+) or antisense (CD38−) CD38 cDNA was performed as described (16Zocchi E. Daga A. Usai C. Franco L. Guida L. Bruzzone S. Costa A. Marchetti C. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8017-8024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were routinely maintained under geneticin (1 mg/ml) selection. All experiments were performed on CD38-sense transfected fibroblasts, expressing a cyclase activity of 8.5 ± 0.7 nmol of cGDPR min/mg of protein, and on CD38-antisense transfected cells, whose cyclase activity was undetectable (16Zocchi E.

CD38− 3T3 cells adherent on 20-mm diameter coverslips were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 100 μm cADPR, while both CD38+ and CD38− (as control) cells were incubated for the same time in the presence or absence of 10 μm 8-NH2-cADPR (or 8-Br-cADPR). Cx43 sense and antisense oligodeoxynucleotides were administered at 20 μm (final concentration) to 3T3 cells adherent on the coverslips in phosphatidylcholine liposomes, prepared by mixing oligodeoxynucleotides with a phosphatidylcholine film in serum-free DME (20Bruzzone S. Guida L. Zocchi E. Franco L. De Flora A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 10-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). After 16 h of culture at 37 °C, cells were re-fed with complete DME. To analyze cytosolic Ca2+, cells were treated as described above, and incubated in the presence of Fura 2-AM (10 μm) for 45 min at 37 °C. Basal cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured as described (16Zocchi E. Daga A. Usai C. Franco L. Guida L. Bruzzone S. Costa A. Marchetti C. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8017-8024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). CD38+ and CD38− 3T3 cells were lysed in water and diluted in sample buffer (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed on 10% polyacrylamide gels (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and proteins were blotted on polyvinylidine difluoride membranes (26Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). Saturation of membranes and incubation with the first (either anti-Cx43 rabbit polyclonal antibody or anti-Cx43 murine monoclonal antibody) and second antibody (anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were performed following instructions of the Amersham ECL immunodetection kit (Amersham Bioscience Inc., Italia, Milan, Italy). 3T3 fibroblasts from adherent cultures were recovered by mechanical scraping, washed once in DME (without phenol red), fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min in ice and permeabilized with 0.1% saponin. Cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% saponin and exposed to either anti-Cx43 polyclonal (5 μg/ml) or monoclonal (5 μg/ml) antibody (see “Experimental Procedures”) for 30 min at 0 °C in the presence of human AB serum (1:200) to avoid nonspecific binding of the antibodies. Cells were then washed and exposed to 10 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG in the presence of serum. Fluorescence intensity was determined on washed samples by flow cytometry using a FACScan (Coulter, Epics XL, Milan, Italy); five thousand events were analyzed per sample. Control samples were fixed and permeabilized as described above and exposed only to the secondary antibody. CD38+-transfected 3T3 cells (107) were incubated in the presence of 20 μmCx43 sense or antisense oligodeoxynucleotides in phosphatidylcholine liposomes as described above. After 16 h of incubation, cells were re-fed with complete medium for a further 24 h. CD38+cells, either treated or untreated with oligodeoxynucleotides, and untreated CD38− cells (as control), were washed with 10 ml of DME (without phenol red), recovered by mechanical scraping, and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 30 s. Pellets were resuspended in 300 μl of cold water and frozen at −20 °C, then thawed and sonicated in ice 1 min at 3 W (Misonix, Farmingdale, NY). A 20-μl aliquot was withdrawn for assay of protein (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar), while the rest of the sample was deproteinized with 10% trichloroacetic acid (23Podestà M. Zocchi E. Pitto A. Usai C. Franco L. Bruzzone S. Guida L. Bacigalupo A. Scadden D.T. Walseth T.F. De Flora A. Daga A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 680-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The cADPR content of the cell extracts was analyzed by two subsequent HPLC chromatographies after addition of trace amounts of radiolabeled [H3]cADPR (5 × 103 cpm) as internal standard (23Podestà M. Zocchi E. Pitto A. Usai C. Franco L. Bruzzone S. Guida L. Bacigalupo A. Scadden D.T. Walseth T.F. De Flora A. Daga A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 680-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Identification of the cADPR peak in the cell extracts was confirmed by: (i) co-elution with the radioactive standard: (ii) comparison of the absorbance spectrum and elution time with standard cADPR, and (iii) disappearance of the corresponding peak in the matched CD38-hydrolyzed samples (23Podestà M. Zocchi E. Pitto A. Usai C. Franco L. Bruzzone S. Guida L. Bacigalupo A. Scadden D.T. Walseth T.F. De Flora A. Daga A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 680-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Concentrations of intracellular cADPR were calculated from the area of the HPLC peak, taking into account the percentage of nucleotide recovery obtained with the radioactive standard. Total RNA from CD38+ and CD38− 3T3 cells was isolated using Trizol reagent (28Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). RNA (5 μg) was reverse-transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega Italia, Milan, Italy) and oligo(dT) primers. Different amounts of reverse transcriptase reaction mixtures were subjected to PCR. The reaction mixtures contained undiluted Thermo buffer (Promega), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTP, 1 unit ofTaq DNA Polymerase (Promega), and 10 μmoligonucleotide primers specific for the different cDNAs. The primers used were: 5′-GGTAAGGATCGCTTCTTCCCTT and 5′-TCCTGTACTTGGCTCACGTGTT for Cx43 cDNA and 5′-CAATGGTGATGACCTGGCCG AND 5′-AATGAGCTGCGTGTGGCTCC for β-actin cDNA. The cycle numbers were 20 for β-actin, 40 for Cx43 and the annealing temperature was 58 °C. The results of PCR amplification, analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining, were quantitated using Chemi Doc System (Bio-Rad, Milan, Italy). Adherent CD38− 3T3 fibroblasts (106) were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in the absence (control) or presence of 100 μm cADPR, with or without each of the following protein kinase inhibitors: 1 μm staurosporin (a nonspecific inhibitor of protein kinases (29Tamaoki T.

Adherent CD38+ 3T3 fibroblasts (106) were incubated for the same time in the absence (control) or presence of 10 μm 8-NH2-cADPR (or 10 μm8-Br-cADPR), with or without 100 nm okadaic acid (inhibitor of phosphoprotein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A, Ref. 34Bialojan C. Takai A. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar). Cells, treated as described above, were then recovered by mechanical scraping and washed with DME (without phenol red). Influx was measured by suspending the cells in 200 μl of DME with or without 10 mm NAD+ for 5 min at 25 °C. Cells were extensively washed at the same temperature with DME (without phenol red) to reduce extracellularly added NAD+ to undetectable concentrations (18Zocchi E. Usai C. Guida L. Franco L. Bruzzone S. Passalacqua M. De Flora A. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Cells were then extracted in 0.3 ml of carbonate buffer (100 mm Na2CO3, 20 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm nicotinamide, pH 10) and the intracellular NAD+ content was determined in alkaline cell extracts with an enzymatic cycling assay (18Zocchi E. Usai C. Guida L. Franco L. Bruzzone S. Passalacqua M. De Flora A. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured on 50-μl aliquots of alkaline cell extracts (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Influx was experimentally determined by measuring the difference of intracellular NAD+ between cells incubated with and without NAD+, the former cell populations being subjected to extensive washings. NAD+ efflux from isolated 3T3 cells was estimated after submitting native cells to zero (control) or 10 sequential washings at 25 °C with 1.5 ml of DME (without phenol red). Efflux was quantitated as the difference between NAD+ present in control, unwashed cells, and in washed cells, respectively (18Zocchi E. Usai C. Guida L. Franco L. Bruzzone S. Passalacqua M. De Flora A. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In some experiments, e.g. those designed to investigate the effects of protein kinase and phosphatase inhibitors, only the extent of NAD+ influx into cells was analyzed. However, in most experiments NAD+ transport was measured in either direction as described above and then referred to the starting concentration of intracellular NAD+ ([NAD+]i). Thus, the percentages of NAD+ transport were calculated as shown. %of transport(influx/efflux)=transported NAD+[NAD+]iat zero time×100Eq. 1 Experiments designed to clamp intracellular calcium were performed by incubating adherent CD38− 3T3 fibroblasts in the presence of 10 μm EGTA-AM for 18 h at 37 °C and then by challenging these cells with 100 μm cADPR for 4 h. Cells were then subjected to the following analyses: (i) fluorimetric determination of [Ca2+] (see above); (ii) flow cytometry, using the monoclonal antibody specific for nonphosphorylated Cx43 (see “Experimental Procedures”); (iii) NAD+ transport assay, measured as influx of extracellular dinucleotide (see above). Murine 3T3 fibroblasts exhibit distinctive [Ca2+]i levels in their native, constitutively CD38− state and following transfection with human CD38 cDNA, respectively (16Zocchi E. Daga A. Usai C. Franco L. Guida L. Bruzzone S. Costa A. Marchetti C. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8017-8024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The higher [Ca2+]irecorded in the CD38+ cells (40 nm) as compared with the wild-type CD38− controls (20 nm) was demonstrated to be causally correlated with the presence of intracellular cADPR (16Zocchi E. Daga A. Usai C. Franco L. Guida L. Bruzzone S. Costa A. Marchetti C. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8017-8024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In an attempt to investigate whether Cx43, whose hexameric hemichannels have been shown to feature NAD+ transporting activity in the plasma membrane (20Bruzzone S. Guida L. Zocchi E. Franco L. De Flora A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 10-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), is also involved in regulating [Ca2+]i levels, we used CD38+fibroblasts pretreated with an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide against Cx43. This reagent has been successfully used to abolish NAD+/cADPR-based paracrine interactions between CD38+ and CD38− 3T3 fibroblasts (22Franco L. Zocchi E. Usai C. Guida L. Bruzzone S. Costa A. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21642-21648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The Cx43 antisense-treated CD38+ cells had a [Ca2+]i of 20.5 ± 1.8 nm,i.e. approximately half of the levels observed in Cx43 sense oligodeoxynucleotide-treated CD38+ cells and comparable to the basal [Ca2+]i measured in the corresponding CD38− cells (Fig. 1). The sharp decrease of [Ca2+]i recorded in the Cx43 antisense-treated fibroblasts was paralleled by a decrease of intracellular cADPR to undetectable levels, while the concentration of this cyclic nucleotide in the corresponding Cx43 sense-treated cells was 4.8 ± 0.9 pmol/mg protein. These findings indicate that down-regulation of Cx43 expression in the CD38+ cells decreases the [Ca2+]i to the same values observed in Cx43-positive, but CD38−fibroblasts. Therefore, lack of expression of either CD38 or Cx43 leads to a remarkably lower [Ca2+]i than measured in cells expressing both proteins, due to disappearance of intracellular cADPR. The plasma membrane of native 3T3 fibroblasts, as well as that of other cell types, harbors Cx43 hemichannels that can mediate a pH-dependent, temperature-independent, bidirectional NAD+ transport down a concentration gradient (20Bruzzone S. Guida L. Zocchi E. Franco L. De Flora A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 10-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). In view of the high intracellular and quite low extracellular NAD+ concentrations (18Zocchi E. Usai C. Guida L. Franco L. Bruzzone S. Passalacqua M. De Flora A. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), release of NAD+ from cells should be largely favored over influx. Earlier experiments had indicated that Cx43-mediated NAD+transport is inhibited in a concentration-dependent fashion by extracellular as well as by intracellular calcium (20Bruzzone S. Guida L. Zocchi E. Franco L. De Flora A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 10-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the correlation between CD38-dependent, cADPR-mediated, changes of [Ca2+]i levels in 3T3 fibroblasts and the corresponding NAD+ transporting activities across the plasma membrane, measured both as influx and efflux of the dinucleotide. Results shown in TableI indicate that maximum NAD+transport occurs in native CD38− 3T3 fibroblasts where the [Ca2+]i is ∼20 nm. Specifically, release of 35% of total NAD+ from cells reflects the total fraction of exchangeable pyridine dinucleotide, most likely identifiable with cytosolic, nonprotein-bound NAD+ (18Zocchi E. Usai C. Guida L. Franco L. Bruzzone S. Passalacqua M. De Flora A. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). On its turn, an influx accounting for 70% was measured in the CD38− cells: this value might be slightly underestimated because of the requirement to wash cells following incubation with added NAD+ to remove the extracellular and surface-bound dinucleotide (18Zocchi E. Usai C. Guida L. Franco L. Bruzzone S. Passalacqua M. De Flora A. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and of consequent partial loss of intracellular NAD+. By comparison, the CD38+ 3T3 cells, whose [Ca2+]i was ∼40 nm, consistently exhibited a remarkably decreased NAD+ transport, notably dinucleotide efflux (1.3%), but also its influx (29%).Table INAD+ transport through plasmamembrane Cx43 hemichannels in CD38+ and CD38− 3T3 murine fibroblastsCell type[Ca2+]iNAD+effluxaMeasured as percentages of transported NAD+ relative to total [NAD+]i at zero time (see “Experimental Procedures”).NAD+influxaMeasured as percentages of transported NAD+ relative to total [NAD+]i at zero time (see “Experimental Procedures”).nm%CD38"
https://openalex.org/W2168707277,"IP3 signaling in Purkinje cells is involved in the regulation of cell functions including LTD. We have used a GFP-tagged pleckstrin homology domain to visualize IP3 dynamics in Purkinje cells. Surprisingly, IP3 production was observed in response not only to mGluR activation, but also to AMPA receptor activation in Purkinje cells in culture. AMPA-induced IP3 production was mediated by depolarization-induced Ca2+ influx because it was mimicked by depolarization and was blocked by inhibition of the P-type Ca2+ channel. Furthermore, trains of complex spikes, elicited by climbing fiber stimulation (1 Hz), induced IP3 production in Purkinje cells in cerebellar slices. These results revealed a novel IP3 signaling pathway in Purkinje cells that can be elicited by synaptic inputs from climbing fibers."

Specifically, phosphorylation of p66ShcA at serine 36 is critical for the cell death response elicited by oxidative damage. We sought to identify the kinase(s) responsible for this phosphorylation. Utilizing the SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell model, it is demonstrated that p66ShcA is phosphorylated on serine/threonine residues in response to UV irradiation. Both c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases are activated by UV irradiation, and we show that both are capable of phosphorylating serine 36 of p66ShcA in vitro. However, treatment of cells with a multiple lineage kinase inhibitor, CEP-1347, that blocks UV-induced JNK activation, but not p38, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, or MEK1 inhibitors, prevented p66ShcAphosphorylation in SH-SY5Y cells. Consistent with this finding, transfected activated JNK1, but not the kinase-dead JNK1, leads to phosphorylation of serine 36 of p66ShcA in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In conclusion, JNKs are the kinases that phosphorylate serine 36 of p66ShcA in response to UV irradiation in SH-SY5Y cells, and blocking p66ShcA phosphorylation by intervening in the JNK pathway may prevent cellular damage due to light-induced oxidative stress.

The molecular mechanisms leading to oxidative cell death have not been not fully elucidated; however, recent studies suggest that phosphorylation cascades may be involved in events triggered by free radical overproduction. For example, members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)1 family, including p38 and JNKs, are activated upon exposure of cells to DNA-damaging agents, hydrogen peroxide, UV irradiation, and hypoxia (5Karin M.

However, it is not clear what events downstream of kinase activation contribute to the ultimate damage induced by oxidative stress. In this regard, it is of interest that phosphorylation of the p66ShcA adaptor protein has been shown to play an important role in signaling events leading to cell death in response to oxidative damage (10Migliaccio E.

Unlike the other isoforms, p66 does not transform mouse fibroblasts, nor does it induce MAPK activation, although p66ShcA is transiently phosphorylated at tyrosine residues in response to growth factor stimulation (22Bonfini L.

The p66 protein is phosphorylated at serine/threonine residues in response to insulin, Taxol, UV, or H2O2treatment (10Migliaccio E. Giorgio M. Mele S. Pelicci G. Reboldi P. Pandolfi P.P.

It has recently been demonstrated that, in response to UV and H2O2 treatment, p66ShcA is phosphorylated mainly at serine 36 in the N-terminal CH2 domain (10Migliaccio E. Giorgio M. Mele S. Pelicci G. Reboldi P. Pandolfi P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 1999; 402: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar). p66ShcA-null mouse fibroblast cells have enhanced cellular resistance to oxidative damage (10Migliaccio E. Giorgio M. Mele S. Pelicci G. Reboldi P. Pandolfi P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 1999; 402: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar). Wild type p66ShcA, but not a phosphorylation-defective mutant, can restore the normal stress response in the p66ShcA-null mouse fibroblast cells. Moreover, mice lacking expression of p66ShcA are less susceptible to chemical induced oxidative damage by paraquat and have an extended life span (10Migliaccio E. Giorgio M. Mele S. Pelicci G. Reboldi P. Pandolfi P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 1999; 402: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar). Therefore, p66ShcA, particularly its phosphorylation at serine 36, appears to be important for the cell death response upon oxidative stress, and the prevention of this phosphorylation may have therapeutic impact on diseases that are associated with oxidative damage. We sought to identify the kinase(s) responsible for phosphorylating serine 36 of p66ShcA. We report here that JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3 phosphorylate p66ShcA in vitro and further demonstrate that blocking JNK activation prevents p66ShcAphosphorylation in UV-irradiated SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. The kinase inhibitors SB203580, LY294002, and PD98059 were purchased from BIOMOL Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA).

All stocks of inhibitors were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and stored at −20 °C in amber glass vials. Further dilutions were made in appropriate solutions containing 0.05% bovine serum albumin (Fraction V, Protease-free). Pefabloc and bovine serum albumin were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, Neural Basal media, and B-27 serum-free supplement were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Aprotinin and protease inhibitor mixture were purchased from Sigma. Recombinant mixed lineage kinases (MLKs) and JNK3α1 were made as described elsewhere (27Maroney A.C. Finn J.P. Connors T.J. Durkin J.T. Angeles T. Gessner G. Xu Z. Meyer S.L. Savage M.J. Greene L.A.

Western blotting p66ShcA antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The Grb2 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Phospho-JNK and JNK antibody were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Myc antibody was purchased from Babco (Richmond, CA). IGF-1 was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). The human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y, kindly provided by Dr. June Biedler (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Rye, NY) and the Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO; ATCC CCL-61) from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 10% CO2. Cells were detached for passage by adding 0.25% trypsin. For all experiments in the presence of compounds the cells were maintained in Neural Basal media supplemented with B27 serum-free nutrient. In experiments utilizing MAPK inhibitors, cells were treated with vehicle (0.2% dimethyl sulfoxide), 15 μm SB203580, 0.5 μm CEP-1347, 10 μm LY294002, or 50 μm PD98059 for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells in a minimal amount of medium were irradiated in a UV Stratalinker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for varying times as indicated. The medium was then restored, and the cells were returned to the incubator for varying amounts of time before further analysis. Cell extracts were prepared by suspending cells in lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 0.2 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Immunoblots and immunoprecipitations were performed according to the procedure of Harlow and Lane (29Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies, a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1988Google Scholar). Cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were separated on precast 10% Tris/glycine SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Chicago, IL), and probed with antibodies as indicated in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 3% bovine serum albumin. After incubating with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody, blots were developed by the ECF reagent (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and analyzed on the STORM PhosphorImager system (Molecular Dynamics, San Francisco, CA). In the instances where the degree of the p66ShcA mobility shift was determined, the distance between the peak volume of the p66ShcA band relative to the reference p52 band was determined for each sample on the PhosphorImager. In the alkaline phosphatase experiment, immunoprecipitated samples were treated with PP2A1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) as described elsewhere (25Yang C.H. Horwitz S.B. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5171-5178PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, immunoprecipitates were incubated with PP2A1 for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding sample buffer and boiling. Mouse p66ShcAcDNA was provided by Dr. Jeffrey Pessin (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA (30Okada S Kao A.W. Ceresa B.P. Blaikie P. Margolis B. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28042-28049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar)). Serine 36 was mutagenized to alanine using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The JNK1 kinase-dead (JNK1KD) plasmid was constructed by substituting an Eco RV-Eco RI fragment of the pcDNA3-HA-JNK1 with a similar fragment that contained alanine 55 instead of lysine. DNAs were transfected into CHO cells by LipofectAMINE Plus reagents as described by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). For generating calmodulin-binding protein (CBP)-p66ShcA fusion proteins, either wild type or mutant S36A p66ShcA cDNA was cloned into pCal-n (Stratagene) to generate CBP-p66ShcA fusions. Expression plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli strain (Novagen, Madison, WI) and grown to mid-log phase. Protein expression was induced by 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C for 3 h. Bacterial lysates were purified on a calmodulin affinity column according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Stratagene). In the in vitro kinase assay, different kinases including MEKK1 (0.1 μg), MKK4 (0.2 μg), MKK7α (0.9 μg), JNK1α1 (0.6 μg), JNK2α2 (0.3 μg), JNK3 (0.3 μg), p38 (0.3 μg), ERK1 (0.3 μg), MLK1 (0.04 μg), MLK2 (0.1 μg), and MLK3 (0.1 μg) were incubated with buffer (control), 1 μg of wild type p66ShcA or mutant p66ShcA S36A proteins, and [32P]ATP in kinase buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 μm ATP, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, and 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate) at 30 °C for 30 min. In control reactions, 20 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP; Sigma) was used instead of p66ShcA proteins. The reactions were stopped by adding sample buffer and heating at 80 °C for 10 min. The p66ShcA or the MBP-containing samples were loaded on a 7.5 or 12% SDS-PAGE gel, respectively, dried, and analyzed on the STORM PhosphorImager system (Molecular Dynamics). P66ShcA is serine/threonine-phosphorylated in response to growth factors, such as epidermal growth factor and insulin, and to cellular stress induced by UV irradiation, hydrogen peroxide, or Taxol treatment (30Okada S Kao A.W.

To determine whether p66ShcA was also phosphorylated on serine/threonine residues in response to cellular stress in a neuronal environment, the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line was UV-irradiated, and electrophoretic mobility was assessed. A retarded electrophoretic mobility shift of p66ShcA was observed in response to UV irradiation after 3 h of post-treatment incubation (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, the mobilities of the p52 and p46 isoforms were not affected. The decreased mobility of p66ShcA is characteristic of post-translational modifications, such as protein phosphorylation. Indeed, this decreased mobility was abolished by serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A1 treatment (Fig. 1 A, lanes 4 and 5). These data support the observation that p66ShcA is phosphorylated at serine/threonine residue(s) after UV irradiation in SH-SY5Y cells, similar to previous results obtained in other cell systems (10Migliaccio E.

MAPKs, most notably JNKs and p38, have been shown to play an important role in response to oxidative damage in neuronal environments (31McLaughlin B. Pal S. Tran M.P. Parsons A.A. Barone F.C. Erhardt J.A. Aizenman E.J. Neuroscience. 2001; 21: 3303-3311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Oh-Hashi K. Maruyama W. Isobe K. Free Radic. Biol.

Lett. 1998; 256: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the MAPKs were responsible for p66ShcAphosphorylation, several known kinase inhibitors were used to determine whether they could block p66ShcA phosphorylation in response to UV irradiation. SH-SY5Y cells were treated with CEP-1347, an MLK inhibitor, SB203580, a p38 inhibitor, LY294002, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, or PD98059, a MEK1 inhibitor, followed by UV irradiation. The SB203580, LY294002, and PD98059 compounds were effective in blocking UV-induced phosphorylation of their respective downstream targets, ATF-2, AKT, and ERK1/2 (data not shown); however, they had no effect on the UV-induced p66ShcA mobility shift (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, at a concentration at which CEP-1347 blocked JNK phosphorylation (data not shown), p66ShcA mobility shift was also inhibited to the same degree as protein phosphatase 2A1 treatment (Fig. 1,A and B). As previously reported, both MLK3 and JNK activation are blocked in the presence of CEP-1347 in SH-SY5Y cells after UV irradiation (27Maroney A.C. Finn J.P. Connors T.J. Durkin J.T. Angeles T. Gessner G. Xu Z. Meyer S.L. Savage M.J. Greene L.A. Scott R.W. Vaught J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25302-25308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). These results suggested that MLKs or kinase(s) regulated by MLKs might be responsible for p66ShcA phosphorylation upon UV irradiation. The major site of serine phosphorylation of p66ShcA after hydrogen peroxide treatment of mouse embryonic fibroblasts is serine 36, and overexpression of a phospho-deficient serine 36 mutant of p66ShcA in p66ShcA-null fibroblasts attenuates hydrogen peroxide induced cell death (10Migliaccio E. Giorgio M. Mele S. Pelicci G. Reboldi P. Pandolfi P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 1999; 402: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar). To determine whether the MLK/JNK pathway affected p66ShcA phosphorylation as suggested by use of the kinase inhibitors in the whole cell studies described above (Fig.1 B) and in an effort to identify the kinase(s) responsible for its phosphorylation, kinases in the MLK/JNK pathway were co-expressed with either wild type (wt p66ShcA) or a serine 36 to alanine (S36A) mutant of p66ShcA and electrophoretic mobility was assessed. The wild type and mutant S36A cDNAs were tagged with a myc epitope and expressed in CHO cells along with MLK3 and JNK1. As described previously (27Maroney A.C. Finn J.P. Connors T.J. Durkin J.T. Angeles T. Gessner G. Xu Z. Meyer S.L. Savage M.J. Greene L.A. Scott R.W. Vaught J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25302-25308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), overexpression of MLK3 led to phosphorylation/activation of JNK (Fig.2 A, lower panel). As shown in Fig. 2 A, in the absence of an upstream activator of JNK1, co-expression of JNK1 with either wt p66ShcA or S36A p66ShcA did not alter the mobility of the Shc proteins. In contrast, co-expression of MLK3, JNK1 and wt p66ShcA, but not S36A p66ShcA protein, induced a decreased electrophoretic mobility of p66ShcA (Fig.2 A). Interestingly, the decreased mobility of wt p66ShcA was not observed when MLK3 and kinase-dead JNK1 (JNK1KD) were co-expressed (Fig. 2 B). It was concluded from these results that the Shc kinase was not MLK3 or kinases downstream of MLK3 and upstream of JNK. These data suggested that JNK, when activated either by UV treatment or MLK3 expression, was able to phosphorylate p66ShcA in whole cells. Whole cell analysis indicated that the JNKs might be responsible for p66ShcA phosphorylation. An in vitro kinase assay was used to test candidate kinases directly. To generate recombinant wt p66ShcA and S36A p66ShcA proteins, wild type or mutant p66ShcAcDNAs were fused to the CBP sequence. Shc proteins were expressed as CBP fusion proteins and purified on a calmodulin affinity column. The recombinant Shc proteins were then used as substrates in a kinase assay to determine whether proteins in the MAPK pathway could phosphorylate Shc specifically at serine 36 in vitro. As shown in the Fig. 3, A and B, all kinases tested were capable of phosphorylating both themselves and MBP, indicating that all of the kinases tested were active in the kinase reactions. ERK1 (Fig. 3 B) and MEKK1 (data not shown) were not able to phosphorylate Shc proteins, whereas MLK1, MLK2, MLK3, MKK4, and MKK7 appeared to phosphorylate wt p66ShcA with no selectivity at serine 36 (Fig.3 C). In contrast, only ∼10% of radioactivity was incorporated into S36A p66ShcA relative to wt p66ShcA when JNK1 and JNK2 were incubated with Shc proteins (Fig. 3, B and C). Similarly, JNK3 and p38 also demonstrated some selectivity to the serine 36 site but to a lesser extent then JNK1 and JNK2. Furthermore, there was a decreased electrophoretic mobility of p66ShcA protein detected when JNKs and p38 were incubated with wt p66ShcA as compared with S36A p66ShcA (Fig. 3 B). The identities of the p66ShcA bands were confirmed by Western analysis (data not shown). These results demonstrated that JNK1, JNK2, JNK3, and p38, but not MLK1, MLK2, MLK3, MKK4, MKK7, ERK1 and MEKK1, were able to phosphorylate Shc at serine 36 selectively in vitro. The p46 and p52 Shc proteins are known to be tyrosine-phosphorylated and form a complex with Grb2 and SOS protein upon growth factor stimulation (12Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. Forni G.

This complex formation couples receptors to the Ras pathway and is critical for cell proliferation and survival. Although p66ShcA is transiently phosphorylated at tyrosines upon growth factor stimulation, binding of Grb2 to p66ShcA does not lead to activation of Ras, but rather evidence suggests that p66ShcA may act as a sink for Grb2 and thereby effectively block growth factor-mediated responses (23Migliaccio E. Mele S. Salcini A.E. Pelicci G. Lai K.M. Superti-Furga G. Pawson T. Di Fiore P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 706-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 30Okada S Kao A.W.

To test whether serine phosphorylation of p66ShcA by UV irradiation altered its binding to Grb2, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. As a control, SH-SY5Y cells were serum-starved and stimulated with insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) (24Kao A.W. Waters S.B. Okada S. Pessin J.E. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 747-7480Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As expected, the amount of p66ShcA associated with Grb2, after normalizing to Grb2 protein in each anti-Grb2 immunoprecipitation, was 3.8-fold higher after IGF-1 stimulation (Fig.4, lanes 2 and 3). A greater association of Grb2 with p66ShcA was observed in the presence of serum as compared with serum-starved cells (Fig. 4,lanes 2 and 4). UV treatment in the presence of serum, however, resulted in a decreased amount of p66ShcAassociated with Grb2 (Fig. 4, lanes 4 and 5). Furthermore, we observed no mobility shift in the p66ShcAassociated with Grb2 either before or after UV treatment, suggesting that a non-serine phosphorylated form of p66ShcA may be associated with Grb2 (Fig. 4, lanes 4 and 5). Similar results were obtained when Shc proteins were immunoprecipitated and Western-blotted with Grb2 antibody (data not shown). These data support the conclusion that, unlike growth factor stimulation, serine-phosphorylated p66ShcA does not result in increased binding to Grb2 during UV irradiation. The p66ShcA protein appears to be a key protein in mediating cellular responses upon oxidative stress. P66ShcAknock-out mice are less susceptible to the pesticide paraquat and also live 30% longer than their normal counterparts (10Migliaccio E. Giorgio M. Mele S. Pelicci G. Reboldi P. Pandolfi P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 1999; 402: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is the demonstration that phosphorylation of p66ShcA at serine 36 is important for the normal cell death response due to oxidative damage. Blocking phosphorylation of serine 36 prevents hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death in fibroblasts (10Migliaccio E. Giorgio M. Mele S. Pelicci G. Reboldi P. Pandolfi P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 1999; 402: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar). In consideration of these observations, it was of interest to determine the kinase(s) that mediated serine 36 phosphorylation of p66ShcA in response to UV irradiation. In a UV-irradiated SH-SY5Y model, it is first shown that an inhibitor of the MLK pathway, CEP-1347, prevents p66ShcAphosphorylation (Fig. 1). This inhibition appears to be specific because p38, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and MEK1 inhibitors have no effect. CEP-1347 has been previously demonstrated to inhibit members of the MLK family, which are upstream activators of MKK4/7 leading to JNK activation. Thus, our initial results implicated members of the MLK family or kinases downstream of these proteins as potential Shc kinases. Phosphorylation of p66ShcA at serine 36 is blocked in cells overexpressing MLK3 and a kinase-dead JNK1 (Fig. 2) suggesting that JNK1 is an Shc kinase. In support of these findings, three JNK isoforms can phosphorylate p66ShcA, predominantly at serine 36, as determined in an isolated kinase assay (Fig. 3). It is concluded from both the whole cell and in vitro analyses that we have identified JNKs as candidate Shc kinases mediating phosphorylation at serine 36 of p66ShcA. The JNKs (also called stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs)) are an integral part of the signal transduction pathways that transmit extracellular signals of stress and injury to a variety of cellular responses including cell death (5Karin M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 851: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 6Davis R.J. Hughes H.

JNK is activated upon DNA and oxidative damage due to UV irradiation, hypoxia, or apoptotic agents such as Taxol (35Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M.

By both molecular and pharmacological approaches, it has been demonstrated that blocking JNK activation can prevent apoptosis after UV irradiation and oxidative stress (9Salh B.S. Martens J.

In primary embryonic superior cervical ganglia and hippocampal neurons, activation of c-Jun after trophic withdrawal or potassium depolarization can lead to neuronal death, whereas blocking c-Jun either by neutralizing antibody, antisense oligonucleotides, or expression of dominant-negative proteins prevents cell death (41Estus S.

Neuron. 1995; 14: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). In support of the cell culture results, the hippocampal neurons from either JNK3 knock-out or phospho-null c-Jun mice are protected from kainate-induced cell death (45Yang D.D. Kuan C.Y.

Genet. 1999; 21: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that blocking c-Jun is sufficient to prevent certain types of cell death, the discovery that p66ShcA is also a substrate of the JNKs suggests that perhaps more than one pathway is triggered by activation of JNKs leading to cell death. Whether p66ShcA phosphorylation and c-Jun activation represent two unique or redundant events leading to cell death remains to be elucidated. It has been reported that half of p66ShcA protein is phosphorylated at serine/threonine residues and associates with Grb2 protein upon epidermal growth factor stimulation (30Okada S Kao A.W. Ceresa B.P. Blaikie P. Margolis B. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28042-28049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The serine/threonine-phosphorylated form of p66 competes with the p52 and p46 Shc protein for the limited pool of Grb2 and thus dominantly inhibits epidermal growth factor receptor downstream signaling events. We tested whether phosphorylated p66ShcA protein acts as a sink for Grb2 binding and thus may dominantly interfere or attenuate the survival pathway. Rather than an increase in p66ShcA-associated Grb2 binding, UV irradiation resulted in a decreased amount of p66ShcA protein associated with Grb2. These results are consistent with the lack of Grb2 binding to Taxol-induced serine-phosphorylated p66ShcA (25Yang C.H. Horwitz S.B. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5171-5178PubMed Google Scholar). Although these studies do not distinguish the specific serine phosphorylated sites induced by the various stimuli, overall the results suggest that serine phosphorylation may lead to distinct downstream events dependent perhaps upon the site of phosphorylation and the upstream kinases involved. Both JNKs and p38 are activated by UV irradiation and are capable of phosphorylating p66ShcA in vitro (Fig. 3). However, only JNKs appear to phosphorylate p66ShcA in SH-SY5Y cells, because inhibition of JNKs by CEP-1347 prevented p66ShcA phosphorylation, whereas inhibition of p38 kinase by SB25038 had no effect after UV irradiation (Fig. 1). Nevertheless, it is possible that the choice of kinase employed to phosphorylate p66ShcA may depend upon the cellular context. The genetic data from the p66ShcA knock-out mice suggest that serine phosphorylation of this protein may have profound effects on the extent of oxidative damage either directly inflicted or incurred with aging (10Migliaccio E. Giorgio M. Mele S. Pelicci G. Reboldi P. Pandolfi P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 1999; 402: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar). Our data link the phosphorylation of p66ShcA to the JNKs, a family well established as involved in oxidative stress responses. It will be of further interest to determine the downstream effects of p66ShcAphosphorylation and the extent to which this protein contributes to JNK-mediated cell death. We thank Dr. Jeffrey Pessin for providing p66ShcA cDNA, Beverly Holskin for helpful guidance in developing the recombinant Shc proteins, and Drs. Anne Camoratto, Donna Bozyczko-Coyne, and Craig Dionne for helpful discussions."

After ligand binding and activation of the Janus protein-tyrosine kinase/STAT and mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathways, negative feedback processes are recruited. These processes attenuate receptor action by suppression of cytokine signaling and by down-regulation of receptor protein expression. This study demonstrates that in human fibroblasts or epithelial cells, OSM first decreases the level of gp130, LIFRα, and OSMRβ by ligand-induced receptor degradation and then increases the level of the receptors by enhanced synthesis. The transcriptional induction of gp130 gene by OSM involves STAT3. Various cell lines expressing receptor subunits to the different interleukin-6 class cytokines revealed that only LIFRα degradation is promoted by activated ERK and that degradation of gp130, OSMRβ, and a fraction of LIFRα involves mechanisms that are separate from signal transduction. These mechanisms include ligand-mediated dimerization, internalization, and endosomal/lysosomal degradation.

Ligand-induced oligomerization of receptor subunits activates Janus protein-tyrosine kinases (JAKs), which in turn phosphorylate tyrosine residues in the receptor cytoplasmic domain. These phosphorylated tyrosines create docking sites for STAT transcription factors (STAT1, -3, and -5), protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, and linker proteins such as Gab-1, Grb2, or SHC, which propagate the signal to other pathways (ERK 1/2, JNK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; Refs. 1Gadient R.A.

Signaling by IL-6 cytokine receptors is transient, often restricted temporally and in magnitude by the action of negative regulators. The SH2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatases SHP1 and -2, through their catalytic function, attenuate the activity of receptor-associated JAKs and consequently lower the induction of STAT-dependent genes (4Auernhammer C.J.

The suppressor of cytokine signaling SOCS1 and -3 are rapidly induced by IL-6 cytokines and, through their SH2 domain, interact and deactivate JAKs or gp130 (4Auernhammer C.J. Melmed S.

The protein inhibitors of activated STATs associate with activated STATs, leading to a loss of STAT-DNA binding activity (11Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Containment of IL-6 cytokine signaling appears to be directed by two distinct mechanisms, (a) the induction or mobilization of factors that attenuate functions of the cytoplasmic domains of the receptor proteins and (b) the enhanced degradation of receptor proteins. Recently we have also demonstrated that receptor signals acting in trans determine the level of the receptor subunit LIFRα and, thus, the cellular responsiveness to LIF (12Blanchard F. Duplomb L.

ERK 1/2, activated by IL-6 cytokines or growth factors, phosphorylates serine 1044 (or serine 185 of the cytoplasmic domain) of LIFRα, leading to its lysosomal degradation independent of LIF binding (12Blanchard F.

An additional ERK-independent degradation pathway for LIFRα has also been observed in NIH-3T3 cells, but this degradation occurred only after LIF treatment (12Blanchard F. Duplomb L. Wang Y.

The other receptor subunits, gp130 and OSMRβ, do not possess a phosphorylation site for ERK 1/2 and, thus, do not appear to be appreciably influenced by activated ERK. However, serine 782 of gp130 located in the cytoplasmic domain has been described as being phosphorylated and directing the cell surface expression of the receptor subunit (14Gibson R.M.

The kinase for this modification is still unknown. Serine 782 is located immediately N terminus to the di-leucine motif of gp130, which was reported to trigger the constitutive, ligand-independent endocytosis of gp130 (15Dittrich E. Haft C.R. Muys L.

The adaptor protein AP2 was noted to interact with the di-leucine motif, enabling the transfer of receptors to clathrin-coated pits, endocytosis, and intracellular targeting to lysosomal degradation (15Dittrich E.

No corresponding information regarding turnover of the other receptor subunit OSMRβ is available.

The cDNA present in 5 μl of reaction mixture was amplified with 0.625 units of Taq polymerase (Promega) and 10 pmol each of sense and antisense primers (20Blanchard F. Raher S. Duplomb L. Vusio P.

The thermal cycle profile was as follows: denaturation for 1 min at 94 °C, annealing for 1 min at 59 °C, and extension for 1 min at 72 °C for 30–35 cycles. The ethidium bromide-stained patterns of the electrophoretically separated PCR products were digitally photographed. The staining intensity of the bands was determined by integration of the pixel values using the ImageQuant program. For Northern blot analysis, aliquots of 20 μg of RNA were separated on 1.5% formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane (Schleicher & Schuell), and reacted with 32P-labeled cDNA probes for OSMRβ or gp130. The radioactive patterns were visualized by autoradiography and by phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics). The ethidium bromide staining pattern of separated ribosomal RNAs was used as a marker for sample loading. Recently, we showed that rat H-35 hepatoma cells respond to 6 h of treatment with LIF or OSM by down-regulation of LIFRα (12Blanchard F. Duplomb L. Wang Y. Robledo O. Kinzie E. Pitard V. Godard A. Jacques Y. Baumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28793-28801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In contrast, the level of gp130 remains essentially constant with only a slight decrease during the first hour and returns to basal values by 2 h (12Blanchard F. Duplomb L. Wang Y. Robledo O. Kinzie E. Pitard V. Godard A. Jacques Y. Baumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28793-28801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To identify whether the mode of receptor subunit turnover as determined in hepatoma cells is also established in other non-hepatic and non-transformed cell types, we analyzed normal human lung fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Based on the activation profile of STAT3, STAT5, and mitogen-activated protein kinases p38 and ERK 1/2, lung fibroblasts responded strongly to OSM and to a lesser degree to LIF or IL-6 (Fig. 1 A). Similar results have been obtained with bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells (data not shown; Refs. 22Cichy J. Potempa J. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8250-8255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar and 23Richards C.D. Kerr C. Tanaka M. Hara T. Miyajima A. Pennica D. Botelho F. Langdon C.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2431-2437PubMed Google Scholar). Within 2 h of OSM treatment, the level of activated STAT3 was reduced by 90% in both fibroblasts and epithelial cells, but by 4–6 h of treatment, it increased again (Fig. 1,B and D). During this treatment period, the level of the fully processed form of OSMRβ (Form 1 in Fig. 1 B) was reduced to 40%, whereas the level of the precursor form (Form 2) was increased 2-fold. In the same cells, the higher molecular forms of LIFRα and gp130 (Form 1) decreased to 50% by a 2-h OSM treatment followed by recovery of the original level (Fig. 1 B). The levels of LIFRα and gp130 precursor forms (Form 2) were increased approximately 2-fold during the 6-h OSM treatment period (Fig. 1, B andC). None of these changes in receptor expression were evident in cells treated with LIF or IL-6, probably because of the relative low level activity of corresponding receptors in these cells (Fig. 1 A and data not shown). Interestingly, in fibroblasts and epithelial cells, an induced expression of SOCS3 could be detected by immunoblotting that peaked at 1 h of OSM treatment (Fig. 1,B and D, lanes marked 60). These results suggest that receptor subunits follow specific turnover mechanisms that are characterized by an initial boost of ligand-induced down-regulation of receptor protein followed by a stimulated synthesis. Together with induced signal-modifying factors such as SOCS3, the regulated expression of receptor proteins appears to determine the temporal profile of activated STAT3 in long term OSM-treated cells. To address the mechanisms by which OSM induces receptors levels, we first analyzed levels of receptor mRNA by Northern blotting for lung fibroblasts (Fig. 2 A) and epithelial cells (not shown). Due to technical limitations, only OSMRβ, but not LIFRα or gp130, yielded a significant signal above background with this technique. The results indicate an increase of OSMRβ mRNA by 6 h of OSM treatment and elevated levels maintained for at least 24 h. To assess the effect of OSM on mRNA of the other receptor subunits, transcripts were analyzed by RT-PCR. RT-PCR with serial dilutions of the input total RNA suggested a higher abundance for gp130 mRNA than OSMRβ and LIFRα mRNA (Fig. 2 B). After 24 h OSM treatment, the signal for OSMRβ mRNA was increased 7-fold, LIFRα mRNA was increased 5-fold, and gp130 mRNA was increased 3-fold (Fig. 2, Cand D). An immediate, but partly transient induction of cytokine-inducible SH2 (CIS), SOCS1, and SOCS3 mRNAs was detected that peaked at 1–2 h of treatment. The screening of various established cell lines from hepatic, mesenchymal, and epithelial origins confirmed the general features of receptor level modulation by OSM. Among these cell lines, we identified NIH-3T3 fibroblasts as a prominent target for induction of gp130 expression by OSM treatment, but as in primary fibroblasts, not by LIF or IL-6 (Fig. 3 A; data not shown for IL-6). Furthermore, like human fibroblasts, 3T3 cells displayed a similar kinetics of STAT3 activation by OSM. The reduction of activated STAT3 temporally correlated with OSM-induced SOCS3 (Fig. 3 A). However, after a 2-h OSM treatment, the level of activated STAT3 increased again, concomitant with a rise in gp130 mRNA (Fig. 3 D) and protein (Fig. 3, Aand B). As noted previously (12Blanchard F. Duplomb L. Wang Y. Robledo O. Kinzie E. Pitard V. Godard A. Jacques Y. Baumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28793-28801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), OSM treatment produced a transient decrease of gp130 protein within the first 30 min of treatment (Fig. 3, B and C), whereas LIFRα was reduced to a 10% level and stayed low during the continued OSM treatment. Due to a lack of suitable antibodies against mouse OSMRβ, the level of OSMRβ in 3T3 cells could not be determined. The fact that OSM treatment did elicit a ligand-dependent, continuous degradation of gp130 parallel to enhanced synthesis is recognized by the accumulation of gp130 fragments, representing gp130 without the extracellular domain that is detectable by the antibodies directed against the C-terminal epitope of gp130 (Fig. 3 B,lower panel). To assess the degradation of receptor protein separate from biosynthesis, 3T3 cells were treated in presence of cycloheximide (Fig. 3 A). The half-life of LIFRα and gp130 was determined to be between 90 and 120 min, and this was reduced to 60 min in the presence of OSM (Fig. 3, A and C). As expected, the induction of SOCS3 protein expression was inhibited by cycloheximide treatment (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, in the same cells, the reappearance of activated STAT3 after 120 min of OSM treatment was prevented, suggesting that this fraction of activated STAT3 in cells not treated with cycloheximide depends on newly synthesized STAT3 and/or receptors. The data presented thus far (Figs.Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3) suggest that LIFRα, OSMRβ, and gp130 are targeted for degradation after OSM treatment and that an effective compensatory synthesis of OSMRβ, gp130, and to a lesser extent LIFRα, occurs that correlates with sustained STAT3 activation after OSM treatment but not after treatment with LIF. The STAT3 and ERK 1/2 pathways are two of the major signaling pathways activated by OSM. To determine their relative contribution to the induction of gp130 synthesis, NIH-3T3 cells were treated with the MEK-1 inhibitor, U0126, or transfected with an expression vector encoding the dominant negative form of STAT3, STAT3Δ55C (18Kim H. Baumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14571-14579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, U0126 inhibited the activation of ERK 1/2 by OSM but did not modify the activation of STAT3. Induction of gp130 was maintained in U0126-treated cells, but induction of SOCS3 was reduced by 50%. In contrast, in STAT3Δ55C-overexpressing cells, gp130 was not increased after OSM treatment, and SOCS3 showed attenuated induction. A functional, cis-acting binding site for activated STAT3 has been reported within the gp130 promoter (24O'Brien C.A. Manolagas S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15003-15010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Therefore, we cloned this gp130 promoter in the pCAT vector and analyzed the effects of OSM treatment on the activity of this promoter. We observed that, depending on the cell line used, OSM induced 2–10-fold the activity of the gp130 promoter, and this induction was prevented by transfection with STAT3Δ55C (data not shown). Together these results strongly suggest that the increased gp130 mRNA and protein in OSM-treated 3T3 cells (Fig. 3 and 4) result from the transcriptional activation of the gp130 gene by STAT3. SOCS3 gene induction appears to depend on STAT3 and ERK pathways. Previous studies suggest that di-leucine motifs and serine phosphorylation in the gp130 cytoplasmic domain direct degradation of gp130 and LIFRα (12Blanchard F. Duplomb L. Wang Y. Robledo O.

Kinetics of transport of glucose analogues, each modified at one position of the pyranose ring, were determined for each transporter. Correlation of kinetics with amino acid sequences indicates that residue Gln-457 sequentially interacts with O1 of the pyranose in the binding site, and with O5 in the translocation pathway. Furthermore, correlation of the selectivity characteristics of the SGLT isoforms (SGLT1 transports both glucose and galactose, but SGLT2 and SGLT3 transport only glucose) with amino acid sequence differences, suggests that residue 460 (threonine in SGLT1, and serine in SGLT2 and SGLT3) are involved in hydrogen bonding to O4 of the pyranose. In addition, the results show that substrate specificity of binding is not correlated to substrate specificity of transport, suggesting there are at least two steps in the sugar translocation process.

Previously we have used the interaction of large aromatic glycosides to probe the vestibule to the sugar-binding site and the translocation pathway. These studies determined essential aglycone-protein interactions of human SGLT1 (hSGLT1) and pig SGLT3 (pSGLT3) and provided a minimum size for the vestibule and sugar transport “pore” (e.g. Refs. 4Lostao M.P.

In this study we focus our attention on the importance of sugar-protein hydrogen bonding in substrate specificity of transport. Determination of interactions between the sugar and the protein is an important step in elucidating the structural factors that determine specificity in the sugar-binding site and will allow future studies on characterization of the translocation pathway. Our strategy was to: 1) determine the importance of the interactions at each position of the sugar for transport through hSGLT1; 2) test the proposed interactions in cotransporters mutated in a single residue identified through sequence analysis; and 3) compare the interactions of these sugars in an SGLT isoform with known differences in sugar recognition (pSGLT3). In this work we have taken advantage of advances in gene technology and application of biophysical methods to cotransport to extend classic studies of the selectivity of sugar cotransport to the molecular level. We studied sugar specificity in four clones: hSGLT1, two hSGLT1 mutants, Q457C and Q457E, and pSGLT3. Interactions of sugars with the SGLTs were studied by analyzing the transport of sugars that differ in only one position of the ring. The importance of each position in the glucose ring was evaluated by determining the apparent affinity (K0.5) for each compound and comparing it with the K0.5 for glucose. The results indicate that residue 457 is important in both sugar recognition and translocation through hydrogen bond interactions with O1 and O5 of the pyranose ring. A plasmid containing human SGLT1 (hSGLT1 (7Hediger M.A. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5748-5752Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar)) cDNA was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis. Glutamine at the 457 position was replaced by glutamic acid (Q457E) using a two-step polymerase chain reaction protocol with the oligonucleotide primers: Q457E-sense, 5′-TTCGATTACATCGAATCGATTACCAGT-3′; and Q457E-antisense, 5′-ACTGGTAATCGATTCGATGTAATC-3′. The underlined letters represent the mutation at amino acid position 457 to a glutamic acid and the ClaI site that was silently introduced as an aid in screening. PCR products were purified and combined in a final PCR reaction using the normal primers flanking the mutation site to produce an insert with AvrII andEco47III restriction sites. The resulting 500-bp fragment was ligated into a similarly treated wild-type-containing plasmid. One transformed colony was screened by sequencing to verify the presence of only the desired mutation. The mutagenized DNA template was linearized with XbaI, and mRNA was transcribed and capped in vitro using the T3 RNA promoter (MEGAscript kit, Ambion, Austin, TX). Mature Xenopus laevis oocytes were injected with 50 ng of mRNA coding for hSGLT1 (7Hediger M.A. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Oocytes were maintained in Barth's medium supplemented with gentamicin (5 mg/ml)/penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 18 °C from 3–6 days until used. Experiments were performed at 22 °C using the two-electrode voltage-clamp method in a rapid perfusion chamber (4Lostao M.P. Hirayama B.A. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 142: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For the experiments, the oocytes were bathed in Na+ buffer composed of (in millimolar) 100 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 HEPES/Tris, pH 7.4, and in the Na+-free buffer, choline-Cl replaced NaCl. The membrane potential was held at −50 mV and stepped for 100 ms from +50 mV to −150 mV, in 20 mV decrements. The sugar-dependent current was the difference between the current recorded in the sugar and the previous record in Na+ buffer alone. All sugar solutions were freshly prepared. The experiments were controlled and data were acquired using pClamp software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The steady-state sugar-dependent currents (I) were obtained at each voltage and sugar concentration as the difference between the current measured at steady state in the presence and absence of the sugar. The apparent affinity constant (K0.5) and the maximal current for saturating sugar (Imax) were obtained by fitting the steady-state currents at each membrane potential to the equation,I = Imax × [S]/(K0.5 + [S]), using the non-linear fitting method in SigmaPlot (SPSS, Chicago, IL) where [S] is the sugar concentration. Working concentrations of MTSHE (1 mm) and MeMTS (0.5 mm) in Na+buffer were prepared from 200 mm stock solutions (in anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide, kept frozen at −20 °C). MTSEA was dissolved immediately before use. The transport level at saturating sugar concentrations was measured before labeling (100 mmαMDG). Labeling with MTSEA and MTSHE was performed with the oocyte membrane clamped at −50 mV, and then the reagent was added to the bath solution for 1 min. MeMTS was applied for 15 min. Iodoacetamide was dissolved at a concentration of 2 mm in Na+buffer at pH 9 (buffered with CAPS). The oocyte, clamped at −50 mV, was bathed with this solution for 20 min. After exposure to the test reagent, the remaining unlabeled transporters were inactivated by exposure to MTSEA for 1 min (3Loo D.D.F. Hirayama B.A. Gallardo E.M. Lam J.T. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl.

All other reagents were purchased from Sigma or Research Organics (Cleveland, OH), unless otherwise specified. Sugar transport was measured by using an inherent property of Na+/glucose cotransporters: Transport of the substrate requires cotransport of Na+, which generates an electrical current (e.g. Refs. 10Mackenzie B.

Initially the oocyte was bathed in Na+ buffer and, when 100 mm αMDG (a saturating concentration) was added, an inward current of −230 nA was generated, representing the maximal substrate-dependent current of the oocyte. The bath solution was changed to choline chloride, to wash the substrates from the chamber, and the current was eliminated. After re-equilibration of the oocyte with Na+ buffer the current returned to the baseline and when 20 mm galactose was added a small current (−15 nA) was generated. After washing and re-equilibration in Na+ buffer to return to the baseline, 20 mm4F4DOglc was added to the bath and a −150 nA current was recorded, suggesting that Q457C has a higher affinity for 4F4DOglc than galactose. From these currents, using different sugar concentrations, the apparent sugar affinities (K0.5) and their maximal transport (Imax) were obtained.K0.5 for 4F4DOglc and galactose were calculated to be 0.33 and 52 mm, respectively (TableI), and the maximal transport for both sugars were around 75% of the αMDG Imax.Table ISummary of apparent affinities for each sugar in hSGLT1, the two mutants: Q457C, Q457E, and pSGLT3SugarhSGLT1Q457CQ457EpSGLT3K0.5RatioglcK0.5RatioglcK0.5RatioglcK0.5RatioglcmmmmmmmmGlucose0.5 ± 0.02111 ± 1.214.0 ± 0.4110 ± 0.41αMDG0.7 ± 0.041.44.6 ± 0.60.42.8 ± 0.60.75 ± 0.40.5βMDG0.5 ± 0.15132 ± 32.914 ± 2.03.57 ± 2.00.71DOglc10 ± 120∞∞55 ± 1.71426 ± 102.62DOglc>100>200∞∞∞∞∞∞3OMglc6 ± 112134 ± 161268 ± 1917∞∞Galactose0.6 ± 0.021.252 ± 74.721 ± 55.2>200>204F4DOglc0.07 ± 0.010.140.33 ± 0.050.030.3 ± 0.050.0756 ± 45.65Thioglc4 ± 186 ± 1.50.5Ki = 40 ± 2410Ki = 17 ± 101.76DOglc3 ± 0.564 ± 0.60.366 ± 0.51.54.0 ± 0.40.4All values are for measurements at −150 mV.

In pSGLT3 galactose Imaxcould not be determined due to its high K0.5 (>200 mm); 2DOglc, 30Mglc, and 5thioglc were not transported, and the remaining sugars were transported at 73 ± 13% (n = 11) of the αMDG Imax. In Q457C, 1DOglc and 2DOglc did not bind, but the remaining sugars were transported as well as αMDG (90 ± 4%, n = 19). Also in Q457E the sugars were transported at 88 ± 5% of the αMDG Imax (n = 16), excluding 2DOglc (non-binding) and 5thioglc, which was not transported. Maximal αMDG currents for Q457C and Q457E were around 200 nA. Similar experiments were performed with each of the four clones with different sugars. As an example, in Fig.2 we show the kinetics obtained for αMDG and 3F3DOglc in hSGLT1 from the same oocyte. TheK0.5 values for the sugars were very different (0.5 ± 0.01 and 9 ± 1.0 mm), but the estimated maximal currents (Imax) were similar: 863 ± 5 and 777 ± 25 nA. We note that the functional expression of hSGLT1 mutants was lower than the wild-type transporter, as reflected by the lower Imax. The sugar specificity of each clone was determined by analyzing apparent kinetic constants of each sugar, and the results are summarized in Table I. All kinetics were determined on at least two different oocytes, and the “reference” Imaxwas estimated for each oocyte using a saturating concentration of αMDG. In general, the Imax for all transported sugars were similar to that for glucose and αMDG: theImax values of the sugars are within 75% of theImax of αMDG except as noted (Table I). Ten hexoses with differences at each position of the ring were tested in hSGLT1-expressing oocytes.Imax values, measured in the same oocyte, were similar for all the transported sugars, but the affinities were very different (Table I). The d-glucoseK0.5 for this transporter was 0.5 mm, but 1DOglc had a higher K0.5 (10 mm), indicating the importance of this –OH. TheK0.5 for α-methyl-d-glucopyranoside (αMDG) which has a methyl group in the first position in the equatorial orientation, was 0.7 mm; thus, the presence of this group had no effect on the affinity. We also tested βMDG, to see if the orientation of this methyl group modified the kinetics, but the K0.5was similar to αMDG (0.5 mm). The most dramatic change in the affinity occurred when the second position of the sugar lost its equatorial –OH group, theK0.5 for 2DOglc was 112 mm. The –OH group here is critical for recognition, because replacement of the –OH with –F (2F2DOglc) or –NH2 (glucosamine) resulted in extremely poor substrates, both having K0.5values of ≫100 mm (not shown). Despite its poor affinity, the Imax for 2DOglc was estimated to be similar to the Imax for glucose. 3OMglc had a K0.5 of 5.5 mm, and hSGLT1 will accept an –F at position 3 (3F3DOglc) with aK0.5 of ∼9 mm (Fig. 2). The only increase in the apparent affinity, compared with glucose, was found when the equatorial –OH in the fourth position was replaced with –F (4F4DOglc) where the K0.5 = 0.07 mm. Changing the orientation in the fourth –OH to the axial position (galactose) had no effect: the K0.5 was identical to d-glucose (0.55 mm). Changing the pyranose O to S in the ring of the sugar, 5-thio-d-glucose, increased theK0.5 to 4.4 mm. The apparent affinity for 6DOglc was 2.7 mm, similar to that for 6F6DOglc (1.3 mm, not shown). The pentose,d-xylose, had a K0.5 of about 100 mm and myo-inositol, a cyclic polyhydroxyalcohol, had a K0.5 of ∼200 mm (not shown). The same sugars were tested in oocytes expressing pSGLT3, and differences in affinity and in selectivity were found (Table I). d-Glucose had a K0.5 of 9.7 mm, similar to βMDG (7.1 mm), but higher than αMDG (4.8 mm). 1DOglc had aK0.5 of 26 mm. Neither 2DOglc nor 3OMglc induced currents, even at concentrations up to 200 mm, indicating that they were not transported. Furthermore, neither 200 mm 2DOglc nor 3OMglc inhibited the current generated by 4 mm αMDG, suggesting that they are also not inhibitors. Galactose had a very high K0.5(>200 mm), and replacing the –OH in the fourth position of glucose for –F (4F4DOglc) improved the K0.5, but it was still higher than the K0.5 for glucose (55 versus 10 mm). 100 mm5thioglc did not induce any current, but it did inhibit 4 mm αMDG-induced current with a Ki of 17 mm. The K0.5 for 6DOglc was 4 mm. The K0.5 for glucose was 11 mm (∼20 times higher than in hSGLT1), and for αMDG it was 4.6 mm (6 times). Surprisingly, the βMDG affinity in Q457C was 32 mm, about 70 times higher than in the WT. Neither 200 mm 1DOglc nor 2DOglc generated any current or inhibited 4 mm αMDG-induced current, i.e. they were non-interacting sugars. For 3OMglc and galactose,K0.5 values were significantly higher for Q457C than in hSGLT1: >100 versus 5.5 mm and 52versus 0.55 mm, respectively. TheK0.5 for galactose was five times higher than that for Glc (52 versus 11 mm). However, the 4F4DOglc K0.5 for this mutant was 0.33 mm, 30-fold lower that for glucose. The sugars 5thioglc and 6DOglc had K0.5 values for Q457C of 5.5 and 4.5 mm, respectively. We have previously shown that, after alkylating Cys-457 with MTSEA, Q457C is still able to bind sugars, but it loses its ability to translocate the sugar across the membrane (3Loo D.D.F. Hirayama B.A. Gallardo E.M. Lam J.T. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7789-7794Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows the current induced by glucose in a Q457C oocyte clamped at −50 mV. The currents were −30 nA at 10 mm and −160 nA at 150 mm concentration. After washing and re-equilibrating the oocyte in Na+ buffer, 1 mm MTSEA was added for 1 min. After treatment, transport was eliminated. Treatment with MTSHE produced the same result, as do a variety of alkylating reagents (e.g. N-ethylmaleimide, [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate and tetramethylrhodamine maleimide (3Loo D.D.F. Hirayama B.A. Gallardo E.M. Lam J.T. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7789-7794Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar)). The reason for inhibition of the translocation part of the transport cycle is unclear; however, although many of the reagents had hydrogen bond-donating or -accepting groups, none contained both functionalities. Our hypothesis was that by replacing the side chain of cysteine with the functional groups of the native glutamine, using iodoacetamide, we could restore WT function. The glucose K0.5 in Q457C was 20 times higher than in WT protein (0.5 versus 11 mm). In Fig. 3B the glucose-induced currents are shown in a different oocyte expressing Q457C. Treatment of this oocyte first with 2 mm iodoacetamide for 20 min and then 1 mm MTSEA for 1 min did not abolish the glucose current (the MTSEA treatment inactivated all the Q457C transporters that had not reacted with iodoacetamide). The second part of the panel shows that the glucose-induced current after the treatment was 70% compared with the initial current indicating that iodoacetamide reacted with 70% of the transporters. A kinetic analysis (at −50 mV) on a single oocyte, before and after labeling with iodoacetamide, showed that the K0.5 of glucose before treatment was 17 ± 2 mm, and after treatment the K0.5 decreased to 8 ± 0.5 mm, with no significant change inImax (not shown). Control experiments with WT protein gave identical currents before and after treatment with 2 mm iodoacetamide and MTSEA. Furthermore, iodoacetamide altered sugar selectivity of Q457C at the 5 position. 5Thioglc was a transported substrate, but after derivatization by iodoacetamide, 5thioglc became an inhibitor. Similarly, derivatizing Q457C with MeMTS also did not abolish transport. In contrast to the effect of iodoacetamide, MeMTS appears to manifest its effect as a decrease in turnover without affecting theK0.5. For example, in two oocytes from the same batch, before MeMTS treatment, the K0.5 for αMDG (at −50 mV) was 13 ± 1 mm, and after derivatizing, the K0.5 was 13 ± 2 mm, but the Imax decreased by 75% after treatment (not shown). The d-glucoseK0.5 (4 mm) was similar to theK0.5 for αMDG (2.8 mm) showing that addition of a methyl group in the alpha position did not change the affinity, but in the beta position K0.5increased to 14 mm. 1DOglc had a very poor affinity (K0.5 = 55 mm). This mutant did not transport or bind 200 mm 2DOglc. Other sugars with poor affinities were galactose (K0.5 = 21 mm) and 3OMglc (K0.5 = 68 mm). On the other hand, 4F4DOglc had the lowestK0.5 found in this mutant (0.3 mm). The only sugar that had similar affinity to the WT was 6DOglc (6versus 3 mm in WT). 5-Thioglucose was not transported by Q457E, but it was an inhibitor of the 4 mmαMDG induced-current (Ki = 40 mm). In this study we have examined the hydrogen bonding interactions involved in substrate specificity in hSGLT1 expressed in X. laevis oocytes. SGLT1 strongly discriminates between its natural substrates, d-glucose and d-galactose, and other hexoses. Our experiments show that by varying the amino acid side chain at position 457 (by site-directed and chemical mutagenesis) we can modify sugar affinity and selectivity. Finally, the differences in sugar affinity and selectivity between hSGLT1 and pSGLT3 emphasize the importance of specific amino acid sequences in determining sugar transport. As shown for sugar binding proteins (e.g. Refs. 12Quiocho F.A. Pure Appl. Chem. 1989; 61: 1293-1306Crossref Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 13Rao V.S.R. Qarba P.K. Balaji P.V. Chandrasekaran R. Conformations of Carbohydrates. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1998: 303-353Google Scholar), the affinity and selectivity of sugar transporters should be largely controlled by the position, number, and type of hydrogen bonds that the protein can make with the sugar. In sugar-binding proteins, the –OH groups and the ring O are involved in extensive hydrogen bonding, and these bonds are of three types: cooperative, where an –OH group simultaneously acts as a hydrogen bond donor and acceptor; bidendate, where adjacent –OH groups hydrogen bond with different atoms of the same polar side chain; and network, where the cooperative and bidendate hydrogen bonds lead to the formation of a network of bonds between the sugar and the protein. Sugar-protein hydrogen bonds are almost equally distributed between the neutral-neutral and neutral-charged types, and the residues making these bonds are, more often than not, those containing planar polar side chains with two functional groups (Asn, Asp, Glu, Gln, Arg, and His). Amino groups, and to a lesser extent –OH groups, are the hydrogen bond donors, and acidic residues (Asp and Glu) are often important when there is little discrimination between anomers or epimers, e.g.d-glucose andd-galactose. In addition to hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic bonding may contribute to sugar-protein interactions, i.e.aromatic residues (Phe, Trp, and Tyr) promote van der Waals interaction with hydrophobic patches on one or both sides of the pyranose ring. Finally, the strength of hydrogen bonding between the sugar and the protein depends on the hydration of the active site; the lower the degree of hydration, the lower the dielectric constant, and the greater the strength of the hydrogen bond. Glucose analogues (each with one modification to the pyranose ring) were used as probes of the structure of the binding site of the human isoform of the Na+/glucose cotransporter (hSGLT1) to identify important interactions and residues that determine transport specificity. The relative importance of these interactions was mapped by comparing the kinetics of the series of glucose analogues on hSGLT1, single-site mutants Q457C and Q457E, and pig SGLT3 (pSGLT3). Each modification of the sugar changed the capacity of the sugar to make hydrogen bonds with the protein, so, if the part of the sugar that has been modified is important in substrate recognition and/or translocation, we would expect to see changes in transport kinetics. The hydroxyls were replaced with either: –F, which can accept hydrogen bonds; –SH, a donor but very rarely an acceptor; –NH2, which only donates; –S–, which can only accept, or; –CH3, which does not donate or accept hydrogen bonds (14Jeffrey G.A. An Introduction to Hydrogen Bonding. Oxford, New York, NY1997: 15Google Scholar). The majority of the changes in potential hydrogen bonding interactions at every position in the sugar decreased affinity with respect to glucose. This indicates that the protein-sugar interactions for the transporter are specific and involve each position of the pyranose ring. These results, combined with the effect of alkylation of Q457C hSGLT1, indicate that residue 457 strongly interacts with O1 of the pyranose in the sugar recognition process. The analysis also implicates O5, in the ring, as interacting with the 457 residue in the translocation pathway. An interpretation of the results (Table I) is as follows. The transport protein must donate a hydrogen bond to O1 of the sugar for optimal affinity. 1DOglc cannot accept a hydrogen bond here, and its K0.5 was more than 20 times higher than glucose. If a methyl group was added to an equatorial or axial oxygen at the first position of the glucose (αMDG or βMDG) the affinity was similar to d-glucose, which indicates that the sugar does not need to donate a hydrogen bond from this position, suggesting the presence of a protein–OH or –NH2 group. This also indicates that, although the protein must donate to the sugar, the hydrogen bond-donating group is either positioned to interact with both anomers or is not highly constrained. The α or β methyl group may also make hydrophobic interactions that compensate for the lost of hydrogen bond donation at position 1. The additional mass of the methyl group is easily accommodated, because our previous studies have shown that large structures can be added to the pyranose ring, especially in the β-configuration (4Lostao M.P. Hirayama B.A. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 142: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 5Dı́ez-Sampedro A. Lostao M.P. Wright E.M. Hirayama B.A. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 176: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The second position in the sugar has a very specific hydrogen bonding requirement that is not compatible with anything other than –OH in the equatorial position. TheK0.5 changed from 0.5 mm for glucose to >100 mm for 2DOglc. This sugar has lost the ability to donate or accept hydrogen bonds at position 2.

This increase in gene expression occurs via activation of the function of the Cys6-Zn(II)2 cluster transcription factor Pdr3p, which in turn autoregulates expression of its structural gene. Surprisingly, the acquisition of PDR5-dependent multidrug resistance occurs at a very high frequency, consistent with the appearance of ρ− cells in a fermentatively growing culture (∼2%). The degree of activation of Pdr3p target genes was found to vary considerably and to be influenced by the presence of the homologous protein, Pdr1p. Mutagenesis and overexpression studies provided evidence that the control of Pdr3p expression was the major control point of this transcription factor by mitochondrial retrograde signaling. Because both ρ0 and oxa1 mutant cells have multiple defects including loss of normal respiratory chain function and oxidative phosphorylation, a series of mutant strains with more selective defects in mitochondrial function was employed to identify the molecular signal that triggersPDR5 transcriptional activation. Only mutations that influenced the functional status of the F0 subunit of the mitochondrial ATPase were found to lead to activation ofPDR5 expression.

ATP binding cassette Pdr1p/Pdr3p response element yeast extract, peptone, and dextrose synthetic complete yeast extract, peptone, glycerol, and ethanol hemagglutinin Multiple drug resistance is frequently associated with overexpression of ATP binding cassette (ABC)1 transporter proteins, which act as broad specificity drug efflux pumps. This is commonly observed in drug-selected tissue culture cells (1Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Annu. Rev. Med. 1991; 42: 277-286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is often a consequence of gene amplification events (for review, see Ref. 2Roninson I.B. Mutat. Res. 1992; 276: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Elevated expression levels of plasma membrane-localized ABC transporters like MDR1 and Mrp1 are known to increase drug export activity of chemotherapeutic agents, which in turn allows evasion of the cytotoxic actions of these compounds (3Gottesman M.M.

Overexpression of these membrane transporter proteins is a major problem for successful chemotherapeutic treatment of cancer in human patients (for a recent review, see Ref. 6Robert J. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 29: 536-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Fungi also express a range of different ABC transporter proteins, several of which are capable of effluxing antifungal drugs (7Decottignies A. Goffeau A.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the multidrug resistance phenotype is referred to as pleiotropic drug resistance or Pdr (9Balzi E. Goffeau A. J. Bioenerget.

Control of PDR5 expression is a critical determinant of drug resistance in S. cerevisiae (9Balzi E. Goffeau A. J. Bioenerget. Biomem. 1995; 27: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Substitution mutant forms of the Pdr1p or Pdr3p transcription factors have been identified that lead to overexpression of PDR5 with associated increases in multidrug resistance (17Carvajal E. van den Hazel H.B.

Yeast. 1992; 8: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) that are both capable of recognizing and binding to a DNA element designated the Pdr1p/Pdr3p response element (PDRE) (21Katzmann D.J. Burnett P.E. Golin J. Mahe Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The PDRE is present in the promoter of all genes responsive to Pdr1p and/or Pdr3p and is found in three copies in the PDR5 promoter (22Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Mahe Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23049-23054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Importantly, the PDR3 gene contains two PDREs and is under autoregulation (23Delahodde A. Delaveau T. Jacq C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4043-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Previously, we have found that loss of the mitochondrial genome (ρ0 cells) or elimination of the mitochondrial inner membrane protein Oxa1p (24Bonnefoy N. Chalvet F. Hamel P. Slonimski P.P. Dujardin G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) led to a pronounced up-regulation of Pdr3p function and a large increase in PDR5 expression (25Hallstrom T.C. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37347-37356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Because both ρ0 and oxa1 mutant cells are defective in electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation, little could be concluded about the nature of the defect triggering Pdr3p activation and PDR5 induction. Here we provide evidence that loss of normal functional levels of the F0 complex of the mitochondrial ATPase is a key event monitored by Pdr3p. Activation of Pdr3p by mitochondrial defects has been found to be an extremely high frequency event, occurring in several percent of cells grown in glucose. Use of a conditional allele of OXA1 indicates that the induction of PDR5 gene expression is an event closely linked to loss of Oxa1p function. Finally, the autoregulatory circuit of PDR3 is critical for normal mitochondrial to nuclear (retrograde (26Liao X. Butow R.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 61-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar)) signaling to activate expression ofPDR5. All yeast strains used in this study were derived from SEY6210, W303, or BY4741, and their genotypes are listed in Table I. Yeast cells were grown in YPD (2% yeast extract, 1% peptone, and 2% dextrose) or synthetic complete (SC) medium (27Sherman F. Fink G. Hicks J. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1979Google Scholar) at 30 °C with shaking. Derivatives of strains lacking their mitochondrial genomes (ρ0) were obtained through growing yeast cells on YPD media containing 25 μg/ml ethidium bromide to saturation for 2 cycles. A gradient spot test assay (28Katzmann D.J. Epping E.A. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell.

Respiratory deficient (petite) cells were identified by their inability to grow on non-fermentable YPGE (2% yeast extract, 1% peptone, 3% glycerol, and 3% ethanol) plates.

The plasmid pXTZ132 was obtained through Sac II digestion of pFL38PP3HA followed by religation by T4 ligase.Sac II cleaves within the center of both PDREs in thePDR3 promoter. This results in pXTZ132 lacking the sequence between the two PDREs of the PDR3 promoter, whereas the religation reforms a new full-length single PDRE. To mutate both PDREs of the PDR3 promoter, primers PDR3dmF (ttA-gCT-GCC-TCC-TCT-GCC-GCT-CGA-GCT-TTa-aGC) and PDR3dmR (ttA-AAG-CTC-GAG-CGG-CAG-AGG-AGG-CAG-cTa-aGC) were designed. Note that the lowercase nucleotides are different from the wild-type sequence. These two primers were annealed, phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase, and cloned into the Sac II site of pXTZ132. The resulting plasmid was named pXTZ133, and the PDRE mutation was confirmed by automated sequencing. This construct has the exact same sequence as the wild-type PDR3 promoter except for the mutations in the PDREs as shown in Fig. 4. The Sal I and Sph I fragment of pTH233 (low copy number plasmid pRS315 (33Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing the wild-type PDR3 gene) was replaced with the analogous fragment from pFL38PP3HA or pXTZ133 resulting in pXTZ134 and pXTZ136, respectively. The PGK1 promoter was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA using primers PGKxbaI-733F (CAT-CTA-GAT-AAT-AGG-CAT-TTG-C) and PGKNcoIR (AGA-CCA-TGG-TTT-TAT-ATT-TGT-TG) and cloned into the Topo2.1 vector (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid pXTZ138 was digested withXba I and Nco I and cloned into pXTZ134 cleaved with the same enzymes. This construct contains a PGK1 promoter-driven 2×HA-tagged PDR3 and was named pXTZ138. XZY18 was generated by transforming yeast strain aW303 with the Eco RI-digestedoxa1-Δ1 ::HIS3 allele obtained from the plasmid pGPM3-Oxa1-N12345cNut::HIS3 (34Hell K. Herrmann J. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Disruption of the OXA 1 locus was confirmed by PCR using primers OXA15′ (CTG-GAG-GAA-CTG-CGC-GGG) and HIS3500F (GCA-AGA-GCT-AGC-AGA-ATT-AC). Ayme1- Δ1 :kanMX4 gene disruption strain was obtained from Research Genetics. YME1–478F (AGC-GCA-AAT-TCC-TGC-TCC) and YME12689R (GCG-TAT-TGA-TAC-ACA-TGT-ACC) primers were designed to amplify the disruption locus. The PCR products were first cloned into Topo2.1 vector, and the resulting plasmid pXTZ150 was then digested with Not I and Spe I and transformed into yeast strain aW303 or XZY18. Appropriate transformants were selected on G418- containing plates and further confirmed by PCR amplification using YME1–719 (CTC-ATC-CCA-ACT-CGA-CTT-CC) and KanB (CTG-CAG-CGA-GGA-GCC-GTA-AT) as primers. The resulting yeast strains were named XZY19 and XZY20, respectively. The enzymatic activities of β-galactosidase expressed from lacZ genes fused toPDR5, TRP5, YOR1, and SNQ2 promoters were determined by usingo- nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate. Yeast cells were grown on SC media with appropriate supplements to mid-log phase. The β-galactosidase activity of appropriate transformants was determined as described (35Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activities of cells containing PDR3-lacZ or YRR1-lacZ were assayed by a chemiluminescent β-galactosidase assay method as described previously (25Hallstrom T.C. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37347-37356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). All assays were done at least twice from two independent transformations, and enzyme activities were reported as an average ± S.D. Yeast cells were grown in 10 ml of YPD or SC media to an A 600 = 0.6–1.0. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and subjected to glass bead breakage by a Tomy shaker for 20 min at 4 °C. Whole cell extracts were obtained by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 3 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar). 100 μg of proteins of each sample were incubated with an equal volume of gel-loading buffer containing 15% SDS and 8 m urea for 30 min at 37 °C. Protein samples were then electrophoresed through a 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with 2.5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline, the membrane was probed with polyclonal anti-Atp4p or anti-Cox2p at a dilution of 1:1000. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody and an ECL kit (Pierce) were used to detect the immunoreactive proteins. The same nitrocellulose membranes were then blocked overnight with 2.5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline and reprobed with monoclonal anti-Vph1p followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody, and the immunoreactive band was detected by the ECL kit. It has been previously shown that mitochondrial status is a critical determinant of drug resistance in S. cerevisiae. Our previous work demonstrated that loss of mitochondrial DNA (ρ0 cell) or deletion of the mitochondrial inner membrane protein-encoding gene OXA1 caused a large elevation in the cycloheximide resistance phenotype of the cells (25Hallstrom T.C. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37347-37356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The increased cycloheximide tolerance was due to an elevation in the function of the zinc cluster-containing transcription factor Pdr3p. Pdr3p in turn stimulated expression of thePDR5 gene, encoding an ATP binding cassette transporter protein that is believed to efflux cycloheximide and other drugs from the cell (see Ref. 37Bauer B.E. Wolfger H. Kuchler K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 217-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar for a recent review of Pdr5p function). Because both ρ0 and oxa1 cells lack the ability to grow on non-fermentable carbon sources like glycerol (petite phenotype) and the frequency of petite mutants occurring in S. cerevisiae can be 5% or higher of the culture (38Dujon B. Strathern J.M. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomcyes. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1981: 505-635Google Scholar), we wanted to determine how frequently cycloheximide hyper-resistant colonies arose spontaneously. To accomplish this, an isogenic series of strains (wild type, Δpdr1, Δpdr3, and Δpdr1 Δpdr3) were grown in rich medium to mid-log phase. About 1500 cells of each strain were plated directly to YPD plates containing 0.25 μg/ml cycloheximide, and the colonies formed were counted (Fig.1). Wild-type or Δpdr1 cells were found to give rise to cycloheximide-resistant cells at a frequency of about 2%, a number comparable with the frequency of petite mutants in the strains (data not shown). However, deletion of PDR3 in either the wild-type or Δpdr1 background totally abolished the presence of any cycloheximide-resistant cells. These data are consistent with the idea that these high frequency spontaneous mutants are drug resistant via activation of a Pdr3p-dependent pathway. To determine whether these cycloheximide resistant cells were petite and assess their level of PDR5 expression, seven clones were picked at random for further analysis. First, each colony was streaked on YPGE plates. None of these strains was able to grow when glycerol and ethanol were present as the sole carbon source. Second, the level of PDR5-dependent β-galactosidase activity was determined by assay of the integrated PDR5-lacZ fusion present in each strain. All of these cycloheximide-resistant colonies also exhibited a large increase in PDR5 expression. These data strongly argue that these cycloheximide resistant colonies that appear at remarkably high frequency arise due to mitochondrial defects that trigger an increase in PDR5 expression. The high frequency of appearance of these drug-resistant colonies is most consistent with defects caused by mitochondrial genome lesions; it is possible that some may be caused by nuclear mutations. Irrespective of the genomic origin of these mutant strains, there is a tight linkage between the petite phenotype and elevation in drug resistance. Pdr3p has been shown by our work and others to be a key regulator of cycloheximide resistance viaPDR5 gene activation (21Katzmann D.J. Burnett P.E. Golin J. Mahe Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 39Delaveau T. Delahodde A. Carvajal E. Subik J. Jacq C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, Pdr3p is capable of stimulating expression of a number of different target genes and resistance phenotypes, consistent with the role of this transcriptional regulator as a multidrug resistance determinant (40Subik J. Ulaszewski S. Goffeau A. Curr. Genet. 1986; 10: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial activation of Pdr3p leads to a 10–13-fold increase in expression of the PDR5 and PDR3 genes, respectively (Fig.2 and Ref. 25Hallstrom T.C. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37347-37356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The relative expression of other Pdr3p target genes, YOR1 (41Hallstrom T.C. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol.

Compared with the ≥10-fold activation of PDR3 and PDR5, the other three Pdr3p-responsive genes increased in expression by no more than 2-fold in ρ0 cells (Fig. 2).PDR5, SNQ2, and YOR1 all encode ABC transporter genes that are directly involved in drug resistance (10Balzi E.

Jacq C. Perea J. Yeast. 1992; 8: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 45Cui Z. Shiraki T. Hirata D. Miyakawa T. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1307-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Whereas the range of response to loss of the mitochondrial genome ranges from 10- to 2-fold for PDR5 and SNQ2, respectively, this cannot be correlated with the number of binding sites for Pdr3p (PDRE). Both of these loci contain 3 PDREs but have a 5-fold difference in their response to loss of the mitochondrial genome. YOR1 and YRR1 both contain a single PDRE and were induced by 2-fold in response to the ρ0signal. These experiments were carried out in a strain expressing both Pdr1p and Pdr3p, which poses a potential complication since both of these factors are able to bind to the PDRE (22Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Mahe Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23049-23054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that only Pdr3p is required for transduction of the mitochondrial signal to the PDR5 promoter (25Hallstrom T.C. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37347-37356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To examine the behavior of these Pdr3p target genes in response to mitochondrial signaling in the absence of Pdr1p, we introduced these same reporter plasmids into ρ0 and ρ+ cells lacking thePDR1 structural gene. The level of β-galactosidase produced from each fusion gene was then determined (Fig.3). Removal of the PDR1 locus from ρ+ cells led to a slight reduction in expression of all three reporter plasmids. Strikingly, loss of Pdr1p from ρ0 cells caused a clear increase in the ability of both YOR1 and SNQ2 to respond to the ρ0 signal. Similarly, the maximal level ofPDR5 expression increased by 2-fold when a Δpdr1 allele was introduced into the ρ0background. This analysis indicates that the presence of Pdr1p dampens the mitochondrial signal through Pdr3p. Because assay of SNQ2 expression indicated that this locus was induced by loss of the mitochondrial genome, the response of the 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide resistance phenotype mediated by Snq2p was also tested (Fig. 3). Cycloheximide resistance was assayed in parallel as a control for the genetic backgrounds tested. Both 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide and cycloheximide tolerance was markedly elevated in ρ0 cells, and a further small increase was seen when the PDR1 gene was removed from the ρ0 background. These data are consistent with the results of the expression analysis of PDR5 and SNQ2. We were unable to test the effect of these mutations on YOR1 since the resistance phenotype mediated by this gene (oligomycin) requires cells to grow on a non-fermentable carbon source. These analyses suggest that the differential response of Pdr3p target genes to mitochondrial retrograde signaling may be a consequence of differential interactions between Pdr1p and Pdr3p at PDRE-containing promoters. The key role of Pdr3p in the retrograde signaling pathway from the mitochondria to the nucleus makes understanding the regulation of PDR3 of paramount importance. We have previously provided evidence that Pdr3p was post-translationally regulated and that autoregulation ofPDR3 was involved (25Hallstrom T.C. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37347-37356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Autoregulation of PDR3 expression was demonstrated by the loss of the activation ofPDR3 gene transcription in ρ0 cells when Pdr3p was not present. Here we confirm that the PDREs in the PDR3 gene promoter are required for ρ0 activation ofPDR3 expression and compare the post-translational regulatory component of Pdr3p to the synthetic regulatory contribution. The two PDREs in the PDR3 promoter were removed by site-directed mutagenesis and placed upstream of a HA-tagged form of wild-type Pdr3p. This PDR3 promoter lacking the two PDREs (mPDREs) or a wild-type version was placed upstream of 2×HA-Pdr3p in low copy number plasmids. The presence of the HA tags did not interfere with Pdr3p function in this assay. 2X. Zhang and W. S. Moye-Rowley, unpublished data. These two different PDR3 genes were introduced into cells lacking PDR1 and PDR3 that were either ρ+ or ρ0. The levels ofPDR5-lacZ supported by the PDR3 clones were then determined (Fig. 4). Introduction of the HA-tagged form of Pdr3p under control of the wild-type PDR3 promoter produced normal PDR5 expression levels in the presence of either ρ+ or ρ0 mitochondria. Importantly, loss of the two PDREs eliminated the response of PDR5 to the ρ0signal and dropped the level of PDR5 expression in ρ+ cells to 10% of normal. This analysis is most consistent with induction of PDR3 mediated directly by binding of Pdr3p to the PDREs. Along with lowering the expression of Pdr3p, the relatively weakPDR3 promot"
https://openalex.org/W2084303869,"More than 50 genes are known to encode K(+) channel monomers and can coassemble to form hetero-tetrameric K(+) channels. However, only a subset of possible monomer combinations come together to form functional ion channels. The assembly and tetramerization of appropriate channel monomers is mediated by association domains (ADs). To identify such domains in human large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels (hSlo1), we screened hSlo1 domains for self-association using yeast two-hybrid assays. Putative ADs were subjected to functional assays in Xenopus oocytes and further characterized by coprecipitation, native gel electrophoresis, and sucrose density gradient centrifugation assays. This led to the identification of a single intracellular association domain localized near the channel pore and required for channel function. We conclude that this novel tetramerization domain, referred to as BK-T1, promotes the assembly of hSlo1 monomers into functional K(Ca) channels."

The role of a new class of soluble metal-binding proteins, known as “metallochaperones”, is emerging as a fundamental accomplishment of this process. However, the only case for which structural information is available concerns the metallochaperones involved in copper transport (1Rosenzweig A.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001; 34: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The present article describes the structure of a novel protein involved in nickel metabolism. The in vivo assembly of urease (EC 3.5.1.5), a nickel-containing enzyme that catalyzes urea hydrolysis in the last step of nitrogen mineralization (2Ciurli S. Mangani S. Bertini I. Sigel A. Sigel H. Handbook of Metalloproteins. Marcel Dekker, New York2001: 669-708Google Scholar) requires at least four accessory proteins (3Mobley H.L.T. Island M.D. Hausinger R.P. Microbiol.

These proteins, named UreD (∼30 kDa), UreE (∼18 kDa), UreF (∼25 kDa), and UreG (∼22 kDa), play fundamental roles in the transport and insertion of two Ni2+ ions into the urease active site (5Mulrooney S.B.

The specific function of these four accessory proteins is not fully understood, even though enough knowledge has been gathered on the Klebsiella aerogenes(Ka) urease assembly system to propose a specific role for each of them (3Mobley H.L.T.

KaUreD was found to form a complex with inactive apo-urease, suggesting that it is a specific chaperone that facilitates nickel insertion into apo-urease by stabilizing a proper protein conformation (7Park I.S.

Pankratz H.S. Wang S. Scott R.A. Finnegan M.G. Johnson M.K. Ippolito J.A. Christianson D.W. Hausinger R.P. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1042-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, not all UreE proteins feature such a long His-rich C terminus region (3Mobley H.L.T. Island M.D. Hausinger R.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 451-480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A genetically modified and truncated form of KaUreE, named H144* KaUreE, lacks the last 15 residues, but displays properties and physiological activity comparable with that of the wild-type KaUreE (12Brayman T.G. Hausinger R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5410-5416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The truncated H144* KaUreE is able to bind approximately two Ni2+ ions per dimer (13Colpas G.J. Brayman T.G.

Miletti, A. Dikiy, S. K. Christensen, K. Kornetzky, D. A. Bryant, I. Vandenberghe, B. Devreese, B. Samyn, H. Remaut, and J. Van Beeumen, submitted for publication. In particular, we have shown that recombinant BpUreE contains a single Zn2+ ion per dimer, while no Ni2+ is present. The presence of Zn2+ is not required for dimerization. Paramagnetic NMR spectroscopy on concentrated (2 mm) BpUreE solutions, using either Zn2+-BpUreE or the corresponding apo-form, revealed a 1 Ni2+/tetramer stoichiometry with the Ni2+ ion bound to histidines in an octahedral coordination environment. We report here the x-ray structure of BpUreE. The structure is the first for this class of proteins and reveals features that suggest a possible molecular role in the urease assembly, a puzzle process requiring five proteins for which only two pieces have been structurally characterized so far. Knowledge of all the molecular details for this biological system could also provide additional targets for potential drugs able to diminish the negative effects of bacterial urease activity both in human health and environmental settings (3Mobley H.L.T.

RecombinantBpUreE was expressed and purified as described elsewhere.1 The purified protein used for crystallization was 10 mg ml−1 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl. Crystals were grown in hanging drops containing the protein and reservoir solution at a 1:1 ratio. Two crystal forms were obtained by equilibration against 0.5 ml of reservoir solution containing 86–92% citrate, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, at 294 K. Both crystal forms are in the I222 space group, are morphologically similar, and grow approximately in a 15:1 ratio. Native crystals of type-I diffract to 1.77 Å resolution and have unit cell dimensionsa = 50.50 Å, b = 60.72 Å, andc = 130.58 Å at 100 K. Native type-II crystals diffract to 1.5 Å and have cell dimensions a = 44.32 Å, b = 63.51 Å, and c = 129.29 Å at 100 K. Both crystal forms contain one molecule of UreE in the asymmetric unit. An isomorphous Hg2+-derivative was obtained by soaking BpUreE crystals of type-I for 3–12 h in 5 μl of reservoir solution containing 1 mmHgCl2. A summary of the collected data is given in Table I. Data were collected on the EMBL wiggler line BW7B of the DORIS storage ring at DESY (Hamburg, Germany) using a MAR345 image plate detector. The data sets were recorded in two sweeps at different exposure times in order to accurately record both the strongest, low-resolution and the weakest, high-resolution diffraction intensities. The Hg2+ CuKα data (Table I) were collected on a DIP 2030 image plate using CuKα radiation generated with a FR591 rotating anode generator (Enraf-Nonius, Delft, The Netherlands) equipped with double-mirror focusing optics. All data were collected at 100 K using crystals soaked for 1–2 min in reservoir solution containing 5% v/v glycerol as cryogenic protectant. Data were processed and merged with DENZO and SCALEPACK (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (38574) Google Scholar). Native data for type-I and type-II crystals were truncated to 1.85 Å and 1.7 Å, respectively. A substitution of Zn2+ by Ni2+was performed by subsequently soaking a type-I BpUreE crystal in equilibrated crystallization solutions containing 50 mm and 100 mm of NiCl2 for 48 and 8 h, respectively. The incorporation of nickel was verified by inspection of anomalous difference maps calculated at 2.6 Å, using data from a single crystal collected at a 1.4525 Å wavelength on the BM14 beam line at the ESRF, Grenoble, France (Table I).Table IData collection and refinement statisticsData collectionNative cell 1Hg BW7BHg CuKαNative cell 2Ni soakWavelength (Å)0.84530.84531.54180.84531.4525Resolution (Å) 20.0 -1.852.052.801.72.09Reflections, total3113566999862382229234093250Reflections, unique177901292552552061912276Av. redundancy1-aHighest resolution bin in parenthesis.10.2 (5.1)15.8 (14.0)1.9 (2.1)6.2 (3.2)3.3 (1.6)Completeness1-aHighest resolution bin in parenthesis.(%)99.7 (99.9)99.3 (99.9)79.4 (84.6)99.0 (96.8)81.3 (67.5)Rsym1-aHighest resolution bin in parenthesis.1-bRsym = ΣhklΣj‖Ij − 〈I〉‖/ΣhklΣjIj where I is the intensity of a reflection, and 〈I〉 is the mean intensity of all symmetry related reflections j.(%)4.8 (3.37)10.1 (39.3)7.4 (27.5)5.8 (28.1)4.5 (18.2)Av.

Type-I crystals were used for structure determination. A single Hg2+ position was identified from isomorphous and anomalous Patterson maps. Refinement of the occupancy and position of the heavy atom and subsequent phase extraction was performed by MLPHARE (24Collaborative Computational Project, N.Acta Cryst. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar) to 2.6 Å.

Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2564) Google Scholar) was used to further improve protein phases, and 90% of the initial model was auto-built in 50 cycles of warpNtrace. Phases for the type-II data were derived from a molecular replacement where the type-I model was used as search model (AMORE, Ref. 24Collaborative Computational Project, N.Acta Cryst. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). A single solution for the rotation and translation vectors was found with R-factor 41.2% and correlation coefficient of 54.3. The final models contain 143 and 142 residues of 147 for type-I and type-II crystal forms, respectively, and were refined to a final R- and free R-factor of 22.8 and 26.4% for type-I and 21.3 and 23.2% for type-II model (CNS, Ref. 26Brunger A.T.

Residues 13–17 were mutated from the expected sequence YESSD to a sequence LSHNI, generated supposedly as a cloning artifact. Ramachadran plots of the type-I and type-II models show 98 and 99% of the residues to be located within the allowed regions (PROCHECK, Ref. 27Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallog. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Coordinates and structure factors for both models of UreE have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the accession codes 1EB0 and1EAR for the type-I and type-II models, respectively. The structure of BpUreE was determined for two alternative oligomerization states obtained from separate crystal forms (I and II) by using SIRAS phases derived from a Hg2+-derivative of type-I crystals. The structure was determined at 1.85 Å and 1.70 Å resolution for type-I and type-II crystal forms, respectively. Details of the crystallization and structure solution and refinement are given under “Materials and Methods” and in Table I. BpUreE is organized as a (α2)2tetramer (∼40 × 70 × 95 Å3) made of the dimerization of two elongated dimers, each of approximate dimensions 40 × 35 × 95 Å3. Each monomer is made up of two distinct domains and has a unique tertiary structure, in agreement with the lack of significant sequence similarity with other known proteins.1 The N-terminal domain encompasses residues 1–73 and is composed of two three-stranded mixed β-sheets that stack upon each other in a nearly perpendicular orientation (Fig.1, A and B). A DALI search (28Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3565) Google Scholar) reveals that a similar topology is reported only for a heat-shock protein domain (Hsp40, Ref. 29Sha B. Lee S. Cyr D.M. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 799-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (145) Google Scholar); Z-score = 3; Z-values >4 are considered to indicate significant structural similarity (28Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3565) Google Scholar)). A short helical (310) region, residues 27–31, is present between strands 2 and 3. The N-terminal domain is separated from the C-terminal domain by a short linker (residues 74–75). The C-terminal domain encompasses residues 76–147 and is composed of a four-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet and two α-helices organized in a βαββαβ-fold (Fig. 1, A andB). Such topology, characterized as the “ferredoxin-like” fold (SCOP, Ref. 30Hubbard T.J.P. Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Chothia C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 236-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), is found in a broad range of different proteins. The latter include human procarboxypeptidase A2 (Ref. 31Garcia-Saez I. Reverter D. Vendrell J. Aviles F.X. Coll M.

A. 1999; 96: 3600-3605Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) (Z = 5.0) among the proteins in which the respective domains most closely resemble the C-terminal domain of BpUreE. The function of these domains varies, depending on the protein in which they are present. In BpUreE, the C-terminal domain is involved in dimerization and metal ion binding. The C-terminal end of the protein is found as a long coil fragment encompassing residues 135–143, while the remaining four amino acids (Gly-144, His-145, Gln-146, and His-147) are not visible in the electron density map due to disorder. The physiologically significant dimeric form of BpUreE is built by a head-to-head interaction of two monomers (Fig. 1, C andD). The hydrophobic face of an amphiphilic helix of the C-terminal domain is involved in the dimerization, this region constituting the central part of the dimer, with the N-terminal domains at the two ends protruding from the core. No S-S bridges are present. The inter-helix interaction is mainly stabilized by induced dipole interactions between pairs of Met-86, Met-89, Glu-90, Ala-93, and Gly-97, one on each monomer at a distance of ∼4–5 Å. These five amino acids are either conserved or conservatively mutated in all UreE proteins.1 The dimer interface further encompasses three strictly conserved residues, Gly-97, Asn-98, and His-100. The latter is involved in the coordination to a Zn2+ ion, located on the peripheral surface in the central portion of the BpUreE dimer (Fig. 1, C and D). Asn-98 Oδ forms an H-bond with His-100 Nδ, further stabilizing the His-100 Nε–Zn2+ bond through a well conserved 'elec-His-Zn’ motif (35Alberts I.L. Nadassy K. Wodak S. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1700-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The BpUreE-Zn2+interaction, although not indispensable for the formation of the dimer1, supposedly further contributes to its stability. In both crystal forms the protein dimer is found to further dimerize around this single Zn2+ ion (Fig.2). The metal center is positioned on the origin of the I222 cell so that each monomer is donating a single His-100 to the ion, which represents the only shared atom between the two dimers. The coordination environment of the Zn2+ ion differs in the two forms characterized crystallographically (Figs. 2and 3, A and B), which are otherwise very similar in overall structure, superimposing with a root mean square (r.m.s.)2 deviation of 0.89 Å for 142 of 147 Cα atoms. In type-I crystals, Zn2+ is coordinated pseudo-octahedrally (Fig. 2, A–C and3A), with the Nε atoms of the four His-100 residues laying in the equatorial plane and the fifth and sixth axial coordination sites occupied by water molecules. In type-II crystals, Zn2+ is coordinated only to the four His-100 Nε atoms in a pseudo-tetrahedral coordination (Fig. 2, D–F and3B). This difference in coordination results in a different relative orientation of the two dimers within the tetramer (Fig. 2). In type-I crystals the two dimers are staggered with a closing angle of ∼40°, and no dimer-dimer interaction is present (Fig. 2C). On the other hand, type-II crystals have a smaller absolute closing angle, with the dimers staggered at ∼ −30° (Fig. 2F). As a consequence, in type-II crystals an interaction patch is formed at the N-terminal domains, involving residues 33–34 and 48–52, causing the formation of an unfavorable clash between two Arg-33 residues on opposing dimers. Furthermore, the residues in the region 48–52 feature increased temperature factors, reflecting a lower degree of order likely due to local strain on the peptide chain. A further consequence of these dimer-dimer contacts is a reorientation of the N-terminal domains relative to the core of the dimers (Fig. 3C). The N-terminal domains are pivoted around the linker (residues 74–75) separating the N- and C-terminal domains, suggesting that this region may serve as a hinge within the UreE dimer. Taken all together, the absence of dimer-dimer interactions in type-I crystals, together with the nature of these interactions in type-II crystals, explains why theBpUreE tetramer is found only in highly concentrated protein solutions.Figure 3Comparison of the Zn2+coordination in both BpUreE models.Aand B, ball and stick representation of the coordination spheres of Zn2+ in type-I and type-II crystals respectively. C, superposition of the Cα trace of type-I (orange) and type-II (blue) models. The superposition was performed only considering the Cα atoms in the C-terminal domain (residues 76–142), which superimpose with an r.m.s. deviation of 0.46 Å, whereas for the resulting N-terminal domains (residues 1–73) an average displacement of 2.75 Å is found. When only the residues in the N-terminal domain are considered, an r.m.s. deviation of 0.70 Å is calculated. It can be concluded that the N-terminal domains pivot around the small linker, residues 74–75, connecting both domains. All figures were made with MOLSCRIPT (36Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallog. 1991; 24: 949-950Crossref Google Scholar) and Raster3D (37Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3875) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The disordered C-terminal region (residues 142–147), which is absent from both models, encompasses two additional histidines (His-145 and His-147) and is located in close proximity to the metal binding site. In diluted solutions, when BpUreE is primarily present as a dimer, one or both of these histidine residues may provide additional ligands to the metal ion, stabilizing the protein-metal complex. It should be noted that in all UreE proteins, the C-terminal tail contains at least one His, most often two in a HXH motif, and for several cases it is constituted naturally by a long His-rich stretch.1 In the case of KaUreE, the second His of the HXH motif in the wild-type protein was artificially removed, producing a truncated form (H144* KaUreE) that was used for most of the physiological studies (12Brayman T.G. Hausinger R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5410-5416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that these C-terminal fragments are disordered in the crystallographically established structure of the tetrameric BpUreE indicates a substantial flexibility of this protein stretch. In the crystallographic tetramer, the HXH 'arm’ motifs, supposedly coordinating the metal ion in the dimer could have been displaced from their position by the incoming pair of His-100 residues from the adjacent BpUreE dimer. Even though attempts to crystallize BpUreE in the presence of Ni2+ ions have all failed, the Ni2+-substituted form of BpUreE could be obtained after type-I crystals were subsequently soaked in solutions containing 50 and 100 mm NiCl2. An obvious peak in the 2.6 Å anomalous difference maps contoured at 9ς confirms the successful substitution of Zn2+ for Ni2+, supporting the view that the latter is bound to this site in physiological conditions. Possibly, the energy barrier for displacing the HXH arm motif from the BpUreE dimer in the presence of nickel instead of zinc, is too high to sustain crystal growth of the Ni2+-bound form of the protein under the given conditions. The structure ofBpUreE allows a rationalization of the biochemical data available for this protein.1 In particular, the molecular determinants for the stabilization of the dimeric form ofBpUreE (and also KaUreE, Ref. 11Lee M.Y. Pankratz H.S. Wang S. Scott R.A. Finnegan M.G. Johnson M.K. Ippolito J.A. Christianson D.W. Hausinger R.P. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1042-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) in diluted solutions in the presence and absence of a metal ion (Zn2+or Ni2+) as revealed by mass spectrometry,1 are now available. Furthermore, the topology of the tetrameric form ofBpUreE, detected1 has been elucidated. Most importantly, the structure clearly indicates a single metal binding site on the protein dimer. Even though only crystals of the Zn2+-bound BpUreE could be obtained, the substitution of Zn2+ by Ni2+ could be accomplished by soaking crystals of the protein in solutions containing NiCl2. The hypothesis that the observed single metal binding site is also the site for physiological Ni2+binding is supported by the presence of only His residues as coordinating ligands, consistent with the NMR evidence of a Ni2+-Hisn binding site in solution.1 All together, these observations support the view that Ni2+, when present, substitutes Zn2+ruling out the possibility that the two metal ions bind at different sites in the protein. The peculiar surface-exposed and peripheral position of the metal ion binding site, together with the flexibility of the proximal C-terminal regions on the two adjacent monomers each containing two His residues, suggests a mode of action for this metallochaperone in the process of Ni2+ uptake and transport, as well as release to the apo-urease-UreD-UreF-UreG super-complex, formed prior to the interaction with UreE (4Hausinger R.P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 279-286Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We propose that the flexible arms at the C terminus could confer flexibility to the metal binding site, adopting a “closed” conformation while binding the metal ion with one or two terminal His residues, or an “open” conformation, freeing coordination sites on the metal ion during the process of release to the target metal site. The latter process must occur upon or after formation of a protein complex involving Ni2+-UreE. In this respect, the presence of an extended hydrophobic surface on the same side of theBpUreE dimer where the metal binding site is located indicates a region of the protein most likely involved in the interaction with the preformed super-complex involving the other urease chaperones UreD, UreF, and UreG, and apo-urease itself. This hydrophobic region comprises the entire protein length, contains some smaller positively charged patches (including the metal ion), and features the most hydrophobic areas toward its outer ends positioned in the N-terminal domains (Fig. 4). On the opposite side of the dimer, the protein instead features an extended negatively charged and hydrophilic surface. It may be worth noticing that the length of the extended BpUreE dimer (∼95 Å) is comparable with the length of one edge of the α3β3γ3 trimer constitutingB. pasteurii urease (2Ciurli S. Mangani S. Bertini I. Sigel A. Sigel H. Handbook of Metalloproteins. Marcel Dekker, New York2001: 669-708Google Scholar), suggesting that threeBpUreE dimers, one on each side of the triangular apo-urease, can independently operate to provide Ni2+ ions to the three active sites of the enzyme. To elucidate the properties and operational mode of this ensemble of accessory proteins in the assembly of the Ni2+-containing active site of urease, the determination of the structure of the remaining urease chaperones is necessary.

Our objective was to identify the functions essential to the optimum growth of Streptococcus thermophilus in milk. Using random insertional mutagenesis on a S. thermophilus strain chosen for its ability to grow rapidly in milk, we obtained several mutants incapable of rapid growth in milk. We isolated and characterized one of these mutants in which anamiA1 gene encoding an oligopeptide-binding protein (OBP) was interrupted. This gene was a part of an operon containing all the components of an ATP binding cassette transporter. Three highly homologous amiA genes encoding OBPs work with the same components of the ATP transport system. Their simultaneous inactivation led to a drastic diminution in the growth rate in milk and the absence of growth in chemically defined medium containing peptides as the nitrogen source. We constructed single and multiple negative mutants for AmiAs and cell wall proteinase (PrtS), the only proteinase capable of hydrolyzing casein oligopeptides outside the cell. Growth experiments in chemically defined medium containing peptides indicated that AmiA1, AmiA2, and AmiA3 exhibited overlapping substrate specificities, and that the whole system allows the transport of peptides containing from 3 to 23 residues.

They generally internalize peptides with an ATP-driving force and belong to the ABC transporter family (1Tam R. Saier M.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 320-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They are composed of oligopeptide-binding proteins (OBP),1 which are periplasmic in Gram-negative bacteria and membrane-associated in Gram-positive bacteria; transmembrane proteins that form a channel for the passage of oligopeptides and inner membrane-associated ATPases, which provide the energy for transport. The oligopeptide transport system of Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium) transports peptides up to hexapeptides. This size limit seems to be imposed by the outer membrane pores rather than by the transporter itself (2Payne J.W. Smith M.W. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1994; 36: 1-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Gram-positive bacteria, the size of the peptides transported is more variable. Peptides from 2 to 7 residues and of 6–7 residues are transported by the oligopeptide transport system ofStreptococcus pneumoniae (3Alloing G. de Philip P. Claverys J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 44-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and Streptococcus gordonii (4Jenkinson H.F. Baker R.A. Tannock G.W. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 68-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. In Lactococcus lactis andListeria monocytogenes, the oligopeptide transport system is capable of internalizing peptides composed of 4–18 amino acids (5Lanfermeijer F.C Picon A. Konings W.N. Poolman B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14440-14450Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and of 5–8 amino acids (6Verheul A. Rombouts F.M. Abee T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 1059-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thirty years ago, Desmazeaud and Hermier (7Desmazeaud M. Hermier J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 28: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) demonstrated that peptides having a mass included between 1000 and 2500 and containing lysine or arginine have a stimulatory effect on the growth of S. thermophilus, whereas larger peptides (masses of 5000) inhibit it. Mixtures of amino acids contained in stimulatory peptides have the same stimulant effect on growth, which demonstrates that stimulatory peptides act as amino acid source. The requirements of S. thermophilus for peptides with specific length were explained by the likely presence of a peptide transport system different from that described in E. coli. The most obvious role of these systems is to supply bacteria with essential amino acids in a low energy fashion. In the case of lactic acid bacteria, which are auxotrophic for several amino acids (8Morishita T. Deguchi Y. Yajima M. Sakurai T. Yura T. J.

Milk Dairy J. 1981; 35: 255-273Google Scholar), the oligopeptide transport system is fundamental to optimal growth. In addition to two di-tripeptide transport systems in L. lactis (a proton motive force-driven di-tripeptide carrier (DtpT) (12Smid E.J. Plapp R. Konings W.N. J.

In the present work, we have identified and characterized the oligopeptide transport system of S. thermophilus. We demonstrate that it works with three functional oligopeptide-binding proteins, that it is capable of transporting entities as large as 23 amino acid peptides, and that it plays a major role in nutrition. The strains used in this work were described in Table I. All E. coli strains were grown on Luria-Bertani medium (18Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) at 37 °C with shaking and in the presence of erythromycin (Em, 150 μg/ml) when required. Three media were used for S. thermophiluscultures. The first medium was reconstituted, low heat skim milk (10% w/v) (Nilac, Nederlands Instituut von Zuivelonderzoek, Ede, The Netherlands), autoclaved at 110 °C for 12 min, buffered with 0.75 mm sodium glycerophosphate and, in some cases, containing bactotryptone at 3 g/liter (pancreatic digest of casein; Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI). Bacterial growth was monitored by measuring optical density (OD) at 480 nm after clarification of the milk by a 10-fold dilution in 2 g/L EDTA pH 12 (19). Two other media were used for general cultures and growth rate experiments. The first was M17Lac medium (20Terzhaghi B.T. Sandine W.E. Appl. Microbiol. 1975; 29: 807-813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in which bacterial growth was monitored by measuring the OD at 600 nm. The second was a chemically defined medium (CDM) containing nucleotides, vitamins, salts, potassium phosphate buffer (0.05 mol·liter−1, pH 6.7) and 0.5% lactose (w/v) as described by Letort and Juillard (21Letort C. Juillard V. J. Appl. Microbiol. 2001; 91: 1023-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and sterilized by filtration. The nitrogen source of the CDM was provided by amino acids, a mix of amino acids associated with a single peptide (Sigma) or αs2-casein trypsic hydrolysate, sterilized by filtration. Peptides MK, MH, EA, ED, EPET, PQFY, DYM, DYMG, YGGFM, RPKPQQFFGLM, MKRPPGFSPFR, ACTH-(1–17) fragment (SYSMEMFRWGKPVGKKR), ACTH-(1–24) fragment (SYSMEMFRWGKPVGKKRRPVKVYP), and oxidized B chain of insulin (FVNQHLCGSHLVEALYLVCGERGFFYTPKA) were used at rate of 100 μmol·liter−1 in the culture medium. Growth rate experiments were then performed at 37 °C using a Microbiology Reader Bioscreen C (Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland) in 100-well, sterile, covered microplates. Each well contained 200 μl of the culture medium. Overnight M17Lac cultures of S. thermophilus were washed twice and resuspended in a volume of sterile potassium phosphate buffer (0.05 mol·liter−1, pH 6.7) equal to the culture volume. 4 μl of the suspension were used to inoculate each well. The optical density was measured at 600 nm every 20 min, after gentle shaking. The apparent growth rate (μmax) was defined as the maximum slope of a semi-logarithmic representation of growth curves, assessed by OD measurements.Table IStrains and plasmidsStrains E. coliTIL206: TG1 supE hsdΔ5 thiΔ (lac-proAB)F[traD 36− proAB+lac1qlacZΔM15] +repAProvided by P.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). The total DNA of integrants obtained by insertional mutagenesis (see below) were digested byEcoRI or HindIII, and then ligated. TIL206 electrocompetent cells were transformed with ligation products, and EmR colonies were screened by PCR after 24-h incubation at 37 °C. PCR amplifications were performed with the Gene Amp PCR system 2400 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences Inc.) using Taq polymerase (Appligene Oncor, Illkirch, France) and oligonucleotides from pG+h9::ISS1 sequences (5′-ACTACTGACAGCTTCCAAGGA-3′ and 5′-ATAGTTCATTGATATATCCTC-3′ forEcoRI digestion and 5′-GTAAAACGACGGCCAGTG-3′ and 5′-TATCTACTGAGATTAAGGTCT-3′ for HindIII digestion). The Dye Terminator kit and a 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) were used for DNA sequencing; each strand was sequenced twice on independent PCR products. DNA sequences were analyzed with Genetics Computer Group (GCG) sequence analysis software from the University of Wisconsin (22Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar) and Mail Fasta (National Center for Biotechnology Information). Internal amiA2 andamiA3 fragments were amplified using degenerated oligonucleotides (5′-TTGTWTACWTCWGAWGGHGAAGA-3′; 5′-ACTATCWRTYAACCAWGCTTG-3′) corresponding to conserved sequences of streptococcal oligopeptide-binding proteins (Refs. 3Alloing G. de Philip P.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 68-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; this work). Annealing was performed at 54 °C. Additional reverse PCRs were performed to amplify fragments flanking the known parts ofamiA1/amiA2/amiA3 genes. The total DNA of the St18 strain was completely digested by HindIII, EcoRI,TaqI, HaeII, HhaI, PstI, orNsiI, ligated in a dilute form (1 μg/ml), and amplified by PCR. Southern and Northern hybridizations were performed using a Positive nylon membrane for transfer (Appligene Oncor, Illkirch, France) according to the instructions in the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Insertional mutagenesis with pG+h9::ISS1 inS. thermophilus St18 had previously been adapted from the method described by Maguin et al. (23Maguin E. Prévost H. Ehrlich S.D. Gruss A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 931-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 24Garault P. Letort C. Juillard V. Monnet V. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 5128-5133Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Integrants affected for their growth in milk were selected on Fast Strain Differencing Agar medium (25Huggins A.M. Sandine W.E. J. Dairy Sci. 1984; 67: 1674-1679Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The genes encoding oligopeptide-binding proteins amiA1,amiA2, amiA3, and the gene encoding cell wall proteinase prtS (26Fernandez-Espla M.-D. Garault P. Monnet V. Rul F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 66: 4772-4778Google Scholar) were inactivated in the St18 strain using the pG+h9 gene replacement system. The mutants obtained are listed in Table I. Deletions were made in the middle of target genes amplified from the DNA St18 strain, as follows. PCR fragments of amiA genes were cloned into the pGEMt easy vector (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. amiA2 deletion was obtained by double digestions with PshAI and BstSNI followed by a ligation step. The partially deleted amiA2 gene fragment was then cloned into pG+h9. Fragments of amiA1 andamiA3 genes were cloned in pG+h9, digested byAvaII for amiA1 and Bsp120I andBstXI for amiA3, and ligated to obtainamiA1 and amiA3 deletions. For theprtS mutant, a PCR fragment gene was first cloned into the TopoXL vector (Invitrogene), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The prtS gene fragment was cloned in pG+h9, and a deletion was obtained by HpaI andNruI digestion followed by ligation. The procedures forS. thermophilus electroporation, pG+h9 integration, and excision were similar to those used for insertional mutagenesis, as described previously (24Garault P. Letort C. Juillard V. Monnet V. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 5128-5133Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 27Biswas I. Gruss A. Ehrlich S.D. Maguin E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3628-3635Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The ability of a toxic peptide analog (aminopterin) to inhibit bacterial growth on M17Lac plates was quantified by determining the extent of the inhibitory zone surrounding a filter paper disc saturated with 30 μg of aminopterin (Sigma). Cells were grown in CDM with αs2-casein trypsic hydrolysate as the nitrogen source containing more than 30 different peptides (28Juillard V. Guillot A. Le Bars D. Gripon J.-C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 1230-1236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured for 13 h and then centrifuged (5 min, 5000 × g). Culture supernatants were concentrated and desalted with ZipTip (Millipore). Mass spectra were recorded in the positive-ion reflectron mode on a Voyager DE-STR mass spectrometer (Perspective Biosystems, Framingham, MA). All experiments were performed using a 20-kV acceleration voltage, a 337-nm laser, and 100-ns delayed extraction. The matrix solution was prepared freshly by dissolving 10 mg of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) in 70/30 acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid, 0.3%. 0.5 μl of the sample was mixed with 0.5 μl of the matrix solution, spotted on a stainless steel sample plate, and air-dried. The insertional mutagenesis in S. thermophilus St18 produced 1.183 × 104 EmR integrants. Based on their phenotype on Fast Strain Differencing Agar, we selected 75 of them. After Southern analysis of the digested chromosomal DNAs of integrants growing slowly in milk, we selected 14 clones in which pG+h9::ISS1 was integrated at only one locus, distinct in each one of them. In 12 clones, pG+h9::ISS1 was tandemly integrated, exhibiting two hybridization bands using pG+h9 as a probe, whereas the 2 remaining clones contained only one copy of pG+h9::ISS1. The growth rate of one of the mutants, called the insertion sequence (IS) mutant throughout this paper, was significantly lower in milk (0.19 h−1) than that of the wild type strain (0.79 h−1). Rapid growth was restored by the addition of bactotryptone (growth rate of 0.75 h−1 for the mutant and of 0.85 h−1 for the wild type strain), suggesting that the affected function was related to nitrogen nutrition. The sequence of the interrupted gene of the IS mutant was determined using oligonucleotides from pG+h9::ISS1. We obtained a 392-bp sequence for the IS mutant, which formed part of an ORF exhibiting homologies with fragments of genes encoding oligopeptide-binding proteins (OBPs) from Streptococci, Bacilli, andL. monocytogenes (Refs. 3Alloing G. de Philip P. Claverys J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 44-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 4Jenkinson H.F. Baker R.A. Tannock G.W. J.

Immun. 2000; 68: 7069-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar; accession no.AF305387). By applying additional reverse PCRs, we obtained a single 7032-bp DNA fragment containing the entire ORF corresponding to the interrupted gene of the IS mutant, together with four additional ORFs displaying a high level of homology with amiC,amiD, amiE, and amiF from different streptococci. These five ORFs, called amiA, amiC,amiD, amiE, and amiF, constituted the five proteins of ATP-binding cassette transporters (31Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3386) Google Scholar); by homology, we named the S. thermophilus genes amiA1,amiC, amiD, amiE, and amiF. Protein sequences deduced from the entire DNA sequence exhibited the greatest homology with similar proteins from S. pneumoniae(ranging from 62% identity for AmiA1 to 86% identity for AmiE),S. gordonii (56% identity for AmiA1), and S. pyogenes (48% identity for AmiA1). Analysis of the sequence revealed the presence of a putative −10 extended promoter sequence situated 35 bp upstream of the ATG start codon of amiA1, and of a putative terminator situated 8 bp downstream of the stop codon ofamiF. The Southern hybridization under nonstringent conditions of HindIII- and EcoRI-digested St18 strain DNA, using a 1400-bp fragment of amiA1 as a probe, revealed two and three bands, respectively, suggesting the presence of at least two homologous genes (Fig. 1). Using PCR with degenerated oligonucleotides deduced from conserved regions of OBPs from streptococci and DNA from the IS mutant to avoid the amplification of an amiA1 gene fragment, we obtained two 1400-bp PCR products corresponding to two fragments of genes, namedamiA2 and amiA3, homologous to each other and toamiA1. With additional PCRs, we obtained 2938- and 3089-bp sequences containing entire amiA2 and amiA3genes, respectively. Comparisons of AmiA1, AmiA2, and AmiA3 protein-deduced sequences revealed a very strong identity between the three proteins (97.6% identity between AmiA1 and AmiA2, 87.1% identity between AmiA1 and AmiA3). amiA1, amiA2, and amiA3 encode proteins with 655, 655, and 657 residues, respectively. Their primary sequences contain a putative membrane lipoprotein lipid attachment site (VLAACS) (32Sutcliffe I.C. Russel R.R.B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1123-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), an extracellular peptide and nickel-binding protein family signature sequence (A7D2TYYIRKGIKW) (1Tam R. Saier M.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 320-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These features indicate the probable covalent attachment of AmiA proteins to the bacterial membrane. Analysis of the DNA sequences revealed the presence of putative −10 extended promoter sequences upstream of the amiA2 andamiA3 start codons, and of putative terminators downstream of the stop codons of the same genes. No open reading frames homologous to other genes encoding oligopeptide transport components were located either 590 and 1130 bp upstream or 500 and 400 bp downstream of theamiA2 and amiA3 genes, respectively. TheamiA3 promoter region differed from that of the two otheramiA genes because of the presence of four potential −10 extended promoter sequences, including two inverted repeat sequences (Fig. 2). Upstream of the three amiAs, we found part of insertion sequences or transposable elements (Fig.3). A shuffled IS1193(GenBank™ accession no. STIS1193) was found upstream of theamiA1 and the amiA2 sequences. The environment upstream of amiA3 differed from that of the other twoamiA genes because of the presence of a L. lactis IS904 (33Rauch P.J. Beerthuyzen M.M. de Vos W.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4253-4254Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Downstream of the amiA2and amiA3 genes, we sequenced a part of S. thermophilus IS1193. PCR screening of 21 industrial and three CNRZ collection S. thermophilus strains, using the same degenerated oligonucleotides as those used to search for amiA2 and amiA3, demonstrated the presence of at least one copy of an amiAgene in all strains. Southern analysis of 12 S. thermophilusstrains, using EcoRI-digested DNA and amiA2 as a probe, highlighted the presence of several large hybridization bands (some larger than 6000 bp; data not shown). These results suggested that the presence of several amiA in S. thermophilus is a general characteristic of this species. The first prerequisite for oligopeptide-binding protein to be functional is expression of the corresponding genes. Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of a 7000-bp transcript hybridizing with a 1860-bpamiA2 fragment (Fig. 4). This demonstrated that the potential promoter and terminator sequences identified upstream of amiA1 and downstream ofamiF, respectively, were functional, and that theamiA1, -C, -D, -E, and -F genes were organized into an operon. Northern blot analysis revealed another 2000-bp transcript hybridizing with the 1860-bp amiA2 fragment, indicating that the potential promoter and terminator sequences identified upstream and downstream ofamiA2 and/or amiA3 genes are functional. This result was confirmed by Northern blot analysis after RNA preparation of the IS mutant, which revealed the same 2000-bp transcript hybridizing with the same 1860-bp amiA2 probe. As expected in this case, no 7000-bp transcript corresponding to an ami operon was visible for the RNA preparation of the IS mutant (data not shown). As a second stage, we constructed stable negative mutants for oligopeptide-binding proteins by gene replacement (23Maguin E. Prévost H. Ehrlich S.D. Gruss A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 931-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) and measured their growth rate in milk. Mutations in the three AmiA-encoding genes were achieved to obtain an AmiA triple negative mutant. Growth of the AmiA1− and AmiA2− mutants was comparable with that of the wild type strain in milk, whereas that of the AmiA3− mutant was significantly lower (Fig.5). The AmiA1/A2/A3− triple mutant exhibited very slow, limited growth in milk, similar to that seen for the IS mutant. This observation confirmed that there are probably no other oligopeptide-binding proteins working with the same system. In addition, we concluded that the mutation in the IS mutant affected the whole operon of oligopeptide transport. This result explained why the AmiA1 mutant and IS mutant exhibited different phenotypes. This was confirmed by the absence of an amioperon transcript on the Northern blot performed with the RNA of the IS mutant. The significant difference in the growth rates of the AmiA3− and AmiA1/A2/A3− mutants indicated that, in addition to AmiA3, at least one other AmiA was functional. At this stage in our work, we concluded that at least two of the three AmiA were functional and functioned with the same permease. The St18 strain is endowed with a cell wall proteinase, PrtS, that degrades proteins and peptides in smaller peptides (26Fernandez-Espla M.-D. Garault P. Monnet V. Rul F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 66: 4772-4778Google Scholar). We constructed each AmiA/PrtS double mutant as well as the AmiA1/A3/PrtS−triple mutant to study the functionality of AmiA proteins independently of extracellular peptide degradation by the cell wall proteinase, PrtS. For technical reasons, we were unable to obtain the AmiA1/A2/A3/PrtS− quadruple mutant. We used CDM containing a trypsic hydrolysate of αs2-casein as the nitrogen source to compare the effects of AmiA mutations on AmiA/PrtS− mutants. The growth of all AmiA/PrtS− mutants was slower than that of the single mutant, PrtS−. More specifically, growth of the AmiA1/PrtS− and AmiA2/PrtS− mutants was half and one third less rapid, respectively, than that of the PrtS− mutant, indicating that AmiA1 and AmiA2 are functional (data not shown). Based on growth experiments in milk and CDM, we concluded that the three AmiA oligopeptide-binding proteins were functional. The simplest way to measure peptide uptake is based on the ability of an auxotrophic strain to utilize peptides as an amino acid source when all the peptidases have an intracellular location, as is the case for S. thermophilus (34Rul F. Monnet V. J. Appl. Microbiol. 1997; 82: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Internalized peptides are then rapidly hydrolyzed by a battery of highly active intracellular peptidases. The rate-limiting step to peptide utilization in Ami mutants is their transport into the cytoplasm because the St18 strain has the same pool of peptidases as AmiA mutants of the ST18 strain. We studied the specificities of AmiA proteins in two stages. First, they were compared by analyzing the external medium of each AmiA/PrtS mutant in CDM, in which nitrogen was supplied by a mixture of peptides. We grew PrtS and AmiA mutants in CDM with a trypsic hydrolysate of αs2-casein as the nitrogen source. After growth, the culture supernatants were analyzed by mass spectrometry. The presence or absence of a peptide in the supernatant indicated complete or incomplete utilization of a peptide by a mutant. Analysis of the culture supernatants revealed differences in peptide composition. Several peptides were totally consumed by the PrtS− mutant but not by AmiA/PrtS− mutants. Their identification provided an indication of the specificities of OBPs. Most differences were found with AmiA3− mutants where some peptides were still present in the medium after growth, although they had completely disappeared from the culture medium of other AmiA and PrtS mutants. Among the most demonstrative examples, presented in TableII, the 92–114 αs2-casein fragment (FPQYLQYLYQGPIVLNPWDQVKR) was still present in the culture supernatants of AmiA3/PrtS− and AmiA1/A3/PrtS− mutants, but not in that of the PrtS− strain or AmiA1/PrtS− and AmiA2/PrtS− mutants. From these MS analyses, we therefore concluded that large peptides were used by the St18 strain and that the AmiA3 protein was capable of binding the peptides of at least 23 residues.Table IIPresence or absence of peptides after the growth of AmiA and PrtS negative mutants in CDM with peptides from"
https://openalex.org/W1963693429,"The concept that selective transfer of high density lipoprotein (HDL)-derived cholesteryl esters (CE) does not require lipoprotein internalization has been challenged recently by evidence that implicates HDL recycling during the selective uptake process. This has prompted us to examine the role of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) in selective uptake. LRP is an endocytic receptor for lipoprotein lipase (LpL) and apolipoprotein E (apoE) ligands that are able to mediate selective uptake. We report that molecules that interfere with ligand binding to LRP, such as the receptor-associated protein (RAP), suramin, α2-macroglobulin, or lactoferrin, inhibit HDL-CE selective uptake by human primary adipocytes and SW872 liposarcoma cells by 35–50%. This partial inhibition of selective uptake from total HDL was not due to preferential inhibition of the HDL2 or HDL3 subfractions. Selective uptake by the scavenger receptor BI was not inhibited by RAP, excluding its involvement. Furthermore, in SW872 cells in which LRP was reduced to 14% of control levels by stable antisense expression, selective uptake was attenuated by at least 33%, confirming a role for LRP in this process. RAP, α2-macroglobulin, lactoferrin, and suramin (individually or in paired combinations) also attenuated selective uptake of HDL-CE by primary human adipocytes by about 40%. On the other hand, human skin fibroblasts express LRP abundantly but lack the capacity for selective uptake, demonstrating that other molecules are required. In SW872 cells, exogenous apoE or LpL can facilitate selective uptake but only the apoE-enhanced uptake can be inhibited by RAP, implicating apoE as a likely co-mediator. We discuss the possible mechanisms by which the endocytic receptor, LRP, can mediate selective uptake.

Selective uptake is the principal means by which HDL, the major donor in this pathway (5Green S.R. Pittman R.C. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 667-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), delivers cholesterol to ovary, testes, and adrenal cells for steroidogenesis (6Glass C. Pittman R.C. Civen M. Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 744-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to adipocytes for storage (7Despres J.P. Fong B.S. Jimenez J. Julien P. Angel A. Am. J.

The tenet of selective uptake (delivery without degradation) may conserve HDL and consolidate its anti-atherogenic role (for review see Ref. 9Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The mechanism of selective uptake is poorly understood. Evidently, HDL first binds to the cell surface. Then, in a crucial but unclear step, CE is passively and reversibly transferred into a plasma membrane pool (10Rinninger F. Pittman R.C. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 1313-1325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Knecht T.P. Pittman R.C. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12043-12048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the CE is irreversibly internalized and hydrolyzed (13Gwynne J.T. Mahaffee D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8141-8150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Selective uptake may involve multiple pathways. This is underscored by the observation that several diverse molecules can selectively internalize CE. Chief among these is the scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI), a physiologically relevant, high affinity HDL receptor (14Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol.

Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20344-20350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) proposed that SR-BI forms a lipophilic channel through which CE and other lipids traverse from the bound lipoprotein to the plasma membrane. As yet, there is no physical evidence for such a model. In addition to SR-BI, selective uptake is mediated by lipoprotein lipase (LpL) (19Schorsch F. Malle E. Sattler W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 20Seo T. Al-Haideri M. Treskova E. Worgall T.S. Kako Y. Goldberg I.J. Deckelbaum R.J. J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1689-1698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and apoE in some cells (22Swarnakar S. Reyland M.E. Deng J. Azhar S. Williams D.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1985; 260: 744-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These molecules are proposed to enhance CE transfer by tethering lipoproteins to the cell surface, thereby increasing their effective concentration at sites of selective uptake. Tethering may also explain the contribution of heparin sulfate proteoglycans (20Seo T. Al-Haideri M. Treskova E. Worgall T.S. Kako Y. Goldberg I.J. Deckelbaum R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30355-30362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) as well as CETP (8Benoist F. Lau P. McDonnell M. Doelle H. Milne R. McPherson R. J. Biol.

Additionally, HDL remodeling by CETP may produce a lipoprotein that is a better substrate for selective uptake (23Collet X. Tall A.R. Serajuddin H. Guendouzi K. Royer L. Oliveira H. Barbaras R. Jiang X.C. Francone O.L. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1185-1193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assertion that distinct pathways underlie selective uptake is further supported by evidence for HDL recycling during selective CE transfer in ob/ob hepatocytes (24Silver D.L. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This finding implies that CE transfer occurs at an intracellular location, as yet undefined. Additionally, this implicates an endocytic step in a process that was originally proposed to be non-endocytic (25Pittman R.C. Knecht T.P. Rosenbaum M.S. Taylor C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2443-2450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If true, the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) (for reviews see Refs. 26Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev.

LRP is already implicated in a broad range of biological processes because it binds numerous, diverse ligands. In addition to those already mentioned, LRP binds and internalizes (26Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar, 27Gliemann J. Biol.

Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar, 27Gliemann J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 951-964PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper we present evidence that the endocytic receptor, LRP, contributes to at least 35% of HDL cholesteryl ester selective uptake by SW872 adipocytes and primary human adipocytes. All common reagents were analytical grade purchased from Fisher, Sigma, or BDH (Poole, UK). ApoA-I was expressed and purified using the IMPACT T7 system (New England Biolabs, Beverly MA). In this system, proteins are expressed in fusion with a self-cleavable affinity tag (intein fused to a chitin binding domain) that allows a single step purification of the fusion protein on a chitin column and elution of the target protein after dithiothreitol-induced self-cleavage of the intein. The apoA-I sequence corresponding to the mature protein (without the pre- and pro-sequences) was amplified by PCR using the full-length apoA-I cDNA as template. The forward and reverse primers included NdeI and SapI restriction sites, respectively. The PCR product and pTYB1 were double-digested with NdeI and SapI and then ligated together. This plasmid was designated pTYB1(AI). This cloning strategy produces apoA-I without any additional amino acids after cleavage from the intein-chitin binding domain. pTYB1(AI) was amplified in DH5α. To express the protein, 100 ng of pTYB1(AI) was electroporated into ER2566 cells that were grown for 1 h at 37 °C in LB medium and then grown at 37 °C in 1 liter of LB, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, to a density of 0.65 atA600. Solid isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (ICN, Aurora, OH) was added to 250 μm, and the protein was expressed for 16 h at 17 °C. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was suspended in 74 ml of ice-cold 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.3% Triton X-100, 20 μg/ml lysozyme (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 1 tablet Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the cells were then clarified by sonication on ice. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the apoA-I was purified on a 6-ml chitin column according to instructions from New England Biolabs. The apoA-I-containing fractions were concentrated by centrifugation using a Centriprep-10 (Millipore, Bedford, MA). By repeated (5 times) dilution and concentration of the apoprotein, the buffer was replaced with 200 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. Typically, about 2 mg of apoA-I was purified from 1 liter, and the proteins appeared pure after SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. ApoA-I (200 μg) was labeled with 200 μCi of Na125I (Amersham Biosciences) using IODO-GEN tubes (Pierce) by the indirect method (35Riske F. Hakimi J. Mallamaci M. Griffin M. Pilson B. Tobkes N. Lin P. Danho W. Kochan J. Chizzonite R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11245-11251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 125I-apoA-I was dialyzed twice in 2 liters of 5 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm sodium azide and then frozen at −80 °C and freeze-dried for 16 h. The dried125I-apoA-I was dissolved in 500 μl of 100 mmNa2HPO4, 6 m guanidine HCl, incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, and then dialyzed 4 times, each time for 4 h against 2 liters of nitrogen-sparged PBS, pH 7.4, with 2 g of Chelex (Bio-Rad). The 125I-apoA-I was used to label HDL (see below). ApoE was purified from human triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins as described (36Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Native α2M was purified from human plasma by zinc-chelate chromatography (37Porath J. Carlsson J. Olsson I. Belfrage G. Nature. 1975; 258: 598-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). The α2M was activated with methylamine and labeled with 125I as described (38Vassiliou G. Stanley K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15172-15178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RAP-glutathione S-transferase was expressed in DH5α and purified (39Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RAP was cleaved from the fusion protein and purified as described (38Vassiliou G. Stanley K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15172-15178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma was collected from healthy normolipemic donors, and HDL or HDL2 and HDL3 subfractions were purified by density gradient ultracentrifugation (40Sattler W. Mohr D. Stocker R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). To prepare lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS), blood was allowed to clot at room temperature for 30 min and centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 15 min at room temperature. The serum was adjusted to a final density of 1.215 g/ml with KBr and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C. The bottom fraction, excluding all lipoproteins, was harvested and dialyzed 3 times in 2 liters of nitrogen-sparged PBS, pH 7.4, with 2 g of Chelex. The dialyzed LPDS was heated at 60 °C for 10 min to inactivate lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase activity and then stored at −20 °C. Prior to use, the LPDS was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min to remove any precipitate. The HDL was labeled with [3H]CE or [3H]cholesteryl ether according to Rodrigueza et al. (18Rodrigueza W.V. Thuahnai S.T. Temel R.E. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20344-20350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) with the following amendments. LPDS (1.5 ml, typically about 120 mg of protein), 5 mg of HDL, 0.01% glutathione, and Complete protease inhibitors were added to a 2-ml polypropylene tube. To this, 100 μCi of [3H]CE or [3H]cholesteryl ether (Amersham Biosciences) in 50 μl of ethanol was injected rapidly. The tube was sealed under nitrogen and mixed slowly by rotation for 36 h at 37 °C. The HDL was isolated by density gradient ultracentrifugation (40Sattler W. Mohr D. Stocker R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) and dialyzed 3 times in 2 liters of nitrogen-sparged PBS, pH 7.4, with 2 g of Chelex. Typically, the specific activity was 15,000–20,000 cpm/μg HDL. To prepare HDL-labeled with 125I-apoA-I, 2.5 mg of HDL that had been labeled with [3H]CE (Amersham Biosciences) was incubated with 200 μg of 125I-apoA-I and mixed slowly by rotation for 6 h at 37 °C. The specific activity of HDL-labeled with125I-apoA-I was typically 40,000–50,000 cpm/μg HDL, and greater than 99% of the radioactivity was trichloroacetic acid-precipitable. All cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. SW872 liposarcoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (3:1), 5% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), with 2 mm l-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Schering-Plough, Quebec, Canada). Human skin fibroblasts (HSF) were from the Coriell Institute of Medical Research, repository number GM00038B, and were cultured as described (38Vassiliou G. Stanley K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15172-15178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SR-BI-expressing CHO cells and control ldl-A7 CHO cells were cultured as described (15Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar). Primary, subcutaneous human adipocytes were obtained from healthy subjects undergoing reduction mammoplasty for cosmetic purposes, and preadipocytes were isolated, seeded at about 50% confluence into 24-well plates, and differentiated as described (41Gauthier B. Robb M. McPherson R. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 142: 301-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Human subcutaneous adipocytes were also obtained commercially from Zen-Bio (Research Triangle Park, NC). LRP-null SW872 cells were prepared by stable expression of antisense RNA. A 120-bp fragment of human LRP (nucleotides 371–490, which includes the ATG start site) was amplified by PCR using full-length human LRP cDNA as template. The forward and reverse primers (5-gcgcgTCTAGAAAAGGAGGAAAAGGGGCGCG-3 and 5-gcaaaACGCGTCAGGAGCAACGGCGG-3, respectively) containedXbaI or MluI restriction sites (underlined) and spacer nucleotides. The PCR product was digested with XbaI and MluI and ligated (in reverse orientation) into pCMV5 that had been similarly digested. The resultant vector was called pCMV5(αsLRP). Stable transfection into SW872 cells was achieved by co-transfection of 20 μg of pCMV5(αsLRP) and 0.4 μg of pSV2-neo by calcium phosphate precipitation (42Wang S. McLeod R.S. Gordon D.A. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14124-14133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Stable transformants were selected with 1000 μm G418 and maintained with 800 μm G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). LRP-null clones were confirmed by Western blotting. Cells were plated in 24-well tissue culture plates at about 25% confluence and grown for 2 days as described above. After 2 days the cells were about 90% confluent. Prior to the selective uptake assay, the cells were washed once at 37 °C in 1 ml of ligand buffer (HBSS, 25 mm Hepes, 5 mg/ml BSA, pH 7.45) and then incubated in this buffer at 37 °C for 30 min. This buffer was replaced with 300 μl of ligand buffer containing [3H]CE-labeled HDL or125I-apoA-I-labeled HDL (at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends), and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for up to 8 h. In some experiments, unlabeled HDL, RAP, suramin, α2M, Lf, or antibodies were included with the labeled HDL. At the end of the incubation the extracellular buffer was removed, and the cells were washed 5 times in HBSS, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.45, at 10 °C. After 8 h of incubation, the cells were shown to be greater than 99% viable according to the trypan blue exclusion assay. After the final wash the medium was removed, and the cells were solubilized with 500 μl of 200 mm NaOH for 2 h at room temperature with gentle mixing. The protein content of 40 μl from each well was measured using the bicinchoninic acid protein reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions with BSA for standard comparison. The 3H or 125I radioactivity of 440 μl of each cell lysate was measured by liquid scintillation counting using Ecolite (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) or by gamma counting, respectively. Proteolytically degraded and resecreted fragments of 125I-apoA-I in the ligand-containing medium were measured according to Goldstein et al. (43Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). The cell association of [3H]CE or 125I-apoA-I is plotted in units of the amount of these labels contained in 1 ng (protein content) of HDL. Plotted thusly, an equivalent cell association of [3H]CE and 125I-apoA-I indicates holoparticle uptake, and any additional [3H]CE cell association is attributed to selective uptake. Kinetic parameters for selective uptake and constants for inhibition of selective uptake were determined by non-linear regression using the Prism computer program (GraphPad Software). SW872 cells were incubated with 50 μg/ml [3H]CE or 125I-apoA-I-labeled HDL for various times up to 4 h. Following this period the cells were rapidly washed 5 times in HBSS, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.45, at 10 °C to remove the labeled HDL from the extracellular medium. The cells were then incubated with 400 μg/ml unlabeled HDL in 300 μl of HBSS, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.45, 5 mg/ml BSA. After 2 h, the3H and 125I radioactivity in the medium or the cells was counted. Cell surface binding and degradation of125I-α2M was measured as described (38Vassiliou G. Stanley K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15172-15178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specific 125I-α2M binding (total minus nonspecific) was used to generate parameters of Kdand Bmax after non-linear regression analysis. Total cellular protein (5 μg) from SW872 cells or LRP antisense-expressing cells was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose (44Hames B.D. Hames B.D. Rickwood D. Gel Electrophoresis of Proteins: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1981: 1-86Google Scholar). The LRP was detected (44Hames B.D. Hames B.D. Rickwood D. Gel Electrophoresis of Proteins: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1981: 1-86Google Scholar) using a polyclonal rabbit antisera (from Dr. G. Bu) followed by chemiluminescent detection (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) of a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. We have confirmed that the band detected co-migrates with LRP that has been purified on a GST-RAP column. Molecular biology techniques were essentially as described by Sambrooket al. (45Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. 3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that SW872 liposarcoma cells grown to 80% confluence express the LRP as well as other functionally important adipocyte genes including adipsin, LpL, CETP, CD-36, and caveolin-1 and -2 and accumulate lipid (not shown), making this cell line a potentially useful human adipocytic model to study selective uptake. We first established that SW872 cells could acquire HDL-CE by selective uptake, with the characteristics previously reported for other cells. When SW872 cells were incubated with [3H]cholesteryl oleate-labeled HDL or 125I-apoA-I-labeled HDL, CE cell association exceeded (by about 5-fold) the cell association and degradation of apoA-I, characteristic of selective uptake (Fig.1A). This selective accumulation of CE was not due to the internalization of radiolabeled degradation products of CE because selective uptake of cholesteryl ether, a non-hydrolyzable analogue of CE, was also observed (Fig.1A). The CE cell association reached a plateau at around 200 μg/ml HDL, confirming that selective uptake was saturable (6Glass C. Pittman R.C. Civen M. Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 744-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Rinninger F. Pittman R.C. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1179-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Non-linear regression analysis, assuming a single class of transporters, generated a maximal transport rate (Tmax) of 269 (±14) ng of HDL protein/mg of cell protein/h, and the half-maximal transport (Km) was at 88 (±12) μg/ml HDL. The time dependence of selective uptake (Fig. 1B) showed that the process rapidly attained and maintained steady state over 8 h. To show specificity, 25 μg/ml labeled HDL was incubated with up to a 100-fold excess of unlabeled HDL (Fig. 1C). The cellular incorporation of [3H]CE was inversely related to the concentration of unlabeled HDL, indicating competition and specificity. In this experiment, which was repeated with more data points, the selective uptake kinetics measured from the competition curve (Tmax = 355 ng HDL protein/mg cell protein/h andKm = 90 μg/ml HDL) reasonably matched the kinetics measured using labeled HDL (Fig. 1A). Selective uptake characteristically includes a reversible and irreversible phase (10Rinninger F. Pittman R.C. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 1313-1325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and we have replicated this observation in SW872 cells (Fig.1D). The reversible phase is proposed to include CE that has entered the plasma membrane, a compartment with a limited capacity to store CE (hence the plateau in the curve). This CE is accessible to extraction by extracellular unlabeled HDL. The plasma membrane CE is subsequently internalized and becomes inaccessible to extraction by extracellular unlabeled HDL, and this CE accumulates within the cell. Overall, these data show that SW872 cells selectively internalize [3H]cholesteryl oleate from HDL. We assessed the involvement of LRP in selective uptake by inhibition with up to 23 μg/ml RAP. We found that RAP inhibited [3H]CE cell association by about 42%, whereas 125I-apoA-I cell association and degradation were not changed significantly (Fig.2A) indicating that selective uptake, rather than holoparticle uptake, was being inhibited. The inhibition was not increased further by increasing RAP to 50 μg/ml. Hence, in SW872 cells there are distinct RAP-inhibitable and RAP-independent pathways contributing to selective uptake. As a positive control, the RAP was shown to inhibit effectively association and degradation of 125I-α2M by SW872 cells at 37 °C (Fig. 2B). The background degradation of125I-α2M, measured in the presence of a 50-fold excess of unlabeled α2M or 500 μg/ml suramin, was similar in SW872 cells and in HSF (not shown), but in SW872 cells the background degradation was about 50% of the total degradation because of the low LRP-dependent degradation. From these curves, half-maximal inhibition is attained when RAP is 1.7 and 1.9 μg/"

Recently, we identified a human Mcm10 homolog that interacts with the mammalian Orc2 and Mcm2–7 complex. We additionally demonstrated that human Mcm10 binds nuclease-resistant nuclear structures during S phase and dissociates from them in G2 phase. In this study, we have further characterized the subcellular localization, modification, and expression levels of human Mcm10 protein throughout the cell cycle. Human Mcm10 protein decreased in late M phase, remained low during G1 phase, started to accumulate, and bound chromatin at the onset of S phase. Proteasome inhibitors stabilized Mcm10 levels, suggesting that proteolysis is involved in the down-regulation of the protein in late M/G1 phase. Dissociation of Mcm10 from chromatin in G2/M phase was concomitant with alterations in the electrophoretic mobility of the protein. Treatment with λ phosphatase revealed that mobility shifts were due to hyperphosphorylation. These results indicate that human Mcm10 is regulated by proteolysis and phosphorylation in a cell cycle-dependent manner. It is further suggested that mammalian Mcm10 is involved in S phase progression, and not the formation of a prereplicative complex, as previously proposed from data on the S. cerevisiae protein.

Recent studies using different systems show that a number of proteins are involved in the initiation of DNA replication, a process that is largely conserved from yeast to human (1Lei M. Tye B.K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1447-1454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Takisawa H. Mimura S. Kubota Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 690-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Current models indicate that initiation consists of two steps. In the first step, the origin recognition complex (ORC),1 Cdc6, Cdt1, and Mcm2–7 proteins sequentially assemble on the replication origins to form the prereplicative complex, from late mitosis to early G1 phase. The ORC, a complex of six proteins (Orc1–6), binds replication origins (3Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar, 4Diffley J.F.X. Cocker J.H.

In the second step, Cdc7/Dbf4 kinase and S phase cyclin-dependent kinases (S-Cdks) activate the prereplicative complex and trigger DNA replication by loading Cdc45 onto each origin with programmed timing (13Zou L. Stillman B. Science. 1998; 280: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 14Aparicio O.M. Stout A.M. Bell S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cdc45 facilitates assembly of the replication machinery by recruiting replication protein A and DNA polymerases (17Mimura S. Takisawa H.

Eukaryotes contain multiple parallel pathways to ensure that the prereplicative complex is not re-assembled until the segregation of chromosomes in mitosis. Cdc6 is either degraded via the ubiquitin-dependent pathway (19Drury L.S. Perkins G. Diffley J.F.X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5966-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) or exported out of the nucleus (20Saha P. Chen J. Thome K.C. Lawlis S.J. How Z. Hendricks M. Parvin J.D. Dutta A. Mol. Cell.

Cdt1 is regulated by protein expression as well as interactions with geminin to ensure that it is active only in the G1 phase (22Wohlschlegel J.A. Dwyer B.T. Dhar S.K. Cvetic C. Walter J.C. Dutta A. Science. 2000; 290: 2309-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 23Tada S. Li A. Maiorano D. Mechali M. Blow J.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Mcm10 (Dna43) was originally discovered in Saccharomyces cerevisiae while screening to identify other mcm mutants (24Merchant A.M. Kawasaki Y. Chen Y. Lei M. Tye B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3261-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Previous studies performed in S. cerevisiae suggest that Mcm10 has multiple roles in DNA replication. Themcm10 mutant is defective in initiation of DNA replication at the non-permissive temperature (24Merchant A.M. Kawasaki Y. Chen Y. Lei M. Tye B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3261-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and causes stalling of replication forks when the replication machinery passes through origins that do not fire (24Merchant A.M. Kawasaki Y. Chen Y. Lei M. Tye B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3261-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In addition, Mcm10 mediates the loading of the Mcm2–7 complex onto replication origins (25Homesley L. Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Sawyer S. Christensen T. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 913-926PubMed Google Scholar), and interacts genetically with Cdc45, DNA polymerase δ and ε, which are required for the elongation steps of DNA replication (26Kawasaki Y. Hiraga S. Sugino A. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 975-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that Mcm10 is involved in both origin activation and elongation, although the mechanisms by which the protein interacts with multiple replication factors at each step remain to be elucidated. Mcm10 homologs have additionally been discovered inSchizosaccharomyces pombe and Caenorhabditis elegans (25Homesley L. Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Sawyer S. Christensen T. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 913-926PubMed Google Scholar, 27Aves S.J. Tongue N. Foster A.J. Hart E.A. Curr. Genet. 1998; 34: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recently, we identified Drosophila and human homologs of Mcm10 and demonstrated that human Mcm10 interacts with the mammalian Orc2 and Mcm2–7 complex (28Izumi M. Yanagi K. Mizuno T. Yokoi M. Kawasaki Y. Moon K.-Y. Hurwitz J. Yatagai F. Hanaoka F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4769-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We also confirmed that human Mcm10 binds chromatin during S phase and dissociates in G2 phase (28Izumi M. Yanagi K. Mizuno T. Yokoi M. Kawasaki Y. Moon K.-Y. Hurwitz J. Yatagai F. Hanaoka F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4769-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), whereas yeast Mcm10 remains bound to chromatin throughout the cell cycle (25Homesley L. Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Sawyer S. Christensen T. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 913-926PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kawasaki Y. Hiraga S. Sugino A. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 975-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To clarify the mechanism of regulation of Mcm10 function in higher eukaryotes, we further characterized the subcellular localization, modification, and protein levels of human Mcm10 throughout the cell cycle in this study. In contrast to yeast Mcm10, expression of the human homolog fluctuated during the cell cycle. Human Mcm10 was phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Our data further established that human Mcm10 bound chromatin only in S phase, suggesting that mammalian Mcm10 is required for S phase progression. HeLa S3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. For synchronization at mitotic phase, exponentially growing HeLa S3 cells were cultured in the presence of 50 ng/ml nocodazole (Aldrich) for 4 h and collected by mitotic shake-off. Mitotic cells were washed twice with nocodazole-free medium, replated with fresh medium, and harvested at indicated timepoints. For synchronization at G1/S boundary, mitotic cells were collected as described above and replated, and arrested with 15 μm aphidicolin (Sigma) for 12–14 h. Cells were released in aphidicolin-free medium and harvested at indicated timepoints. To monitor DNA replication, cells were pulse-labeled with 20 μg/ml bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) for 10 min, and the incorporated label was detected by immunofluorescent staining, using a rat anti-BrdUrd antibody (Harlan Sera-Lab) and Texas red-conjugated goat anti-rat secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories), as described previously (29Izumi M. Vaughan O.A. Hutchison C.J. Gilbert D.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4323-4327Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To determine the mitotic index, cells were fixed in methanol/acetic acid (3:1), spread onto slides, and stained with Giemsa (Invitrogen). Aliquots of 2.0 × 106 HeLa cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in 250 μl of cytoskeleton buffer (CSK buffer: 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm ATP, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.4 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.4 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 μg/ml antipain, and 0.2 μg/ml pepstatin A) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 10 min, and subjected to low-speed centrifugation (3000 rpm for 3 min). Supernatants were further purified by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min to obtain Triton X-100-soluble fractions. After washing Triton-extracted nuclei once in 500 μl of CSK buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, insoluble pellets were collected by low speed centrifugation. For whole-cell extracts, 1 × 106 HeLa cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 125 μl of CSK, and boiled with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For immunoblotting, samples were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred electrophoretically to 0.45 μm polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). After incubation of membranes with primary antibodies in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk for 12 h at 4 °C, membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories) in the same buffer and rewashed. Protein bands were detected using the chemiluminescent reagent SuperSignal (PIERCE) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Kaleidoscope prestained standards (Bio-Rad) were employed as molecular mass standards. Antiserum against Mcm10 was generated in rabbit, as described previously (28Izumi M. Yanagi K. Mizuno T. Yokoi M. Kawasaki Y. Moon K.-Y. Hurwitz J. Yatagai F. Hanaoka F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4769-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Antibodies against human Mcm7, lamin B1, PCNA, p53, and cyclin B1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, while mouse actin antibody was obtained from Chemicon. Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Vector Laboratories. HeLa cells were lysed in ISOGEN (Nippon Gene) every 4 h after release from metaphase. Poly(A)+ RNA and proteins were purified from the same lysate according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Poly(A)+RNA (2 μg) was subjected to Northern blot analysis, as specified (28Izumi M. Yanagi K. Mizuno T. Yokoi M. Kawasaki Y. Moon K.-Y. Hurwitz J. Yatagai F. Hanaoka F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4769-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Triton X-100-soluble fraction collected from 2 × 104 HeLa mitotic cells was incubated with 400 units of λ phosphatase (New England Biolabs) in 15 μl of phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij 35, and 2 mm MnCl2) containing 1× Complete (EDTA-free, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) protease inhibitors at 4 °C for 30 min. In control experiments, phosphatase was inhibited by the addition of 50 mm NaF and 10 mmNa3VO4. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Products were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. The specific inhibitors, ALLM, MG132, and proteasome inhibitor I (PSI) were purchased from Calbiochem and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. Clasto-lactacystin β-lactone from MBL was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide before use. HeLa cells were treated with either protease inhibitors (20 μm) or dimethyl sulfoxide for 12 h. Cells were harvested, and whole cell extracts were prepared. To examine the effects of proteasome inhibitors in early G1 phase, MG132 was added 0–2 h after release from metaphase, and whole cell extracts were prepared 3 h after release. We initially investigated the subcellular localization of Mcm10, following fractionation of HeLa cells into Triton X-100-soluble, chromatin-bound, and nuclease-unextractable samples. Human Mcm10 localized mainly to the nuclease-resistant fraction during S phase and dissociated from the fraction after completion of DNA replication. Here, we estimate the subcellular localization of Mcm10, using Triton X-100 extraction. HeLa cells were lysed with cytoskeleton buffer containing Triton X-100 in the presence of ATP, and soluble and insoluble fractions were separated. This procedure permeabilized nuclei and allowed the elution of weakly bound proteins from chromatin, while prereplication complex and replication machinery remained stably bound. We initially investigated the stage at which human Mcm10 rebound chromatin. HeLa cells were synchronized at metaphase by nocodazole treatment and released into nocodazole-free medium. At indicated timepoints, whole cell extracts and Triton X-100-soluble and insoluble fractions were prepared, and subcellular localization of Mcm10 and other proteins was analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig.1 A). Mcm10 existed in a soluble form at metaphase (Fig. 1 A, indicated by open arrows). SDS-PAGE analyses revealed a slight mobility shift of Mcm10 in metaphase extracts (Fig. 1 A, indicated byopen and closed arrows), suggesting that the protein was subjected to modification. Expression levels of Mcm10 decreased in late M phase, remained low in early G1 phase, and started to increase 6 h after release at the point of initiation of DNA replication (Fig. 1 B). The level of Mcm10 in the insoluble fraction remained fairly constant during S phase (7.5–13.5 h). Mcm10 dissociated from the insoluble fraction in G2 phase, concomitant with an increase in cyclin B1 levels. It is noteworthy that the 117-kDa band of Mcm10 was accompanied by 125- and 133-kDa bands (Fig. 1 A, arrowheads), which may represent ubiquitinated Mcm10, as described below. The insoluble fraction mainly contained the 125 kDa protein, whereas both 125 and 133 kDa proteins were detected in the soluble fraction. Conversely, Mcm7, a component of the prereplicative complex, was free in soluble fraction at metaphase, a part of which was loaded onto chromatin 1.5 h after release. At this timepoint, lamin B1 was insoluble, indicating that the nuclear membrane was reassembled. Levels of Mcm7 associated with chromatin peaked at G1/S boundary and decreased during the progression of S phase, as demonstrated previously (28Izumi M. Yanagi K. Mizuno T. Yokoi M. Kawasaki Y. Moon K.-Y. Hurwitz J. Yatagai F. Hanaoka F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4769-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In contrast, a fraction of PCNA protein (involved in the elongation steps of DNA replication) was associated with chromatin only in S phase. The time-course of loading and dissociation of Mcm10 was similar to that of PCNA. Levels of PCNA and Mcm7 proteins were fairly constant during the entire cell cycle. To investigate whether low expression of Mcm10 results from periodic transcription, Northern blot hybridization was employed to determine mRNA levels (Fig. 2 A). Since the transcripts of most proteins involved in DNA replication are regulated by E2F transcription factors, transcription should be down-regulated in early G1. The mRNA levels of Mcm10 and PCNA were measured at indicated timepoints after release from metaphase. Mcm10 transcripts resolved into a doublet, as observed previously (28Izumi M. Yanagi K. Mizuno T. Yokoi M. Kawasaki Y. Moon K.-Y. Hurwitz J. Yatagai F. Hanaoka F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4769-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Mcm10 mRNA increased 2-fold at 4 h after release, reached maximum levels at 8 h (4-fold) and subsequently decreased. Similar to the pattern of Mcm10 mRNA expression, the mRNA levels of PCNA exhibited a 3-fold change during the cell cycle. In contrast, Mcm10 protein levels observed 4 h after release showed an 80% decrease, with a subsequent increase (Fig. 2 B). These results suggest that Mcm10 protein expression is not mainly regulated at the transcription level, but depends on degradation. We observed 125- and 133-kDa bands associated with the 117 kDa Mcm10 protein in cell extracts (Fig. 1 A). From the apparent molecular mass of these proteins, we speculated that these bands represent ubiquitinated Mcm10. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is responsible for degradation of cell cycle-regulating proteins, including cyclin B1 and securin in late M phase (30Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1991; 349: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar, 31Zou H. McGarry T.J. Bernal T. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1999; 285: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next determined whether Mcm10 degradation is dependent on the 26 S proteasome by examining the effects of proteasome inhibitors on the steady-state level of Mcm10. After HeLa cells were treated with proteasome inhibitors for 12 h, Mcm10 levels were determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 3 A). Treatment with proteasome inhibitors (MG132, PSI, and lactacystin) resulted in a 2.7–3.3-fold increase in Mcm10 expression. Since MG132 and PSI are potent inhibitors of other proteases, including calpain and calpactins, cells were also treated with ALLM, which is more inhibitory for calpain than proteasome. ALLM had no effect on the Mcm10 level. As a positive control, the levels of p53, a well known substrate of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, were determined. The treatment with proteasome inhibitors also increased p53 levels, although p53 was more stabilized by MG132 than by PSI or lactacystin. In contrast, proteasome inhibitors did not affect PCNA levels. To investigate whether the down-regulation of Mcm10 in late M/G1 phase was due to proteasome-mediated degradation, we synchronized HeLa cells at metaphase and examined the effects of MG132 on Mcm10 expression (Fig. 3 B). When MG132 was added to cells during metaphase, cells were not released into G1 phase, since degradation of cyclin B1 by proteasome is essential for mitosis progression (Fig. 3 B, lane 2). Therefore, MG132 was added 1–2 h after release, and cell lysates were prepared 3 h after release (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3–4). The protein levels of Mcm10 in early G1 phase increased in the presence of MG132, suggesting that proteasome-mediated proteolysis is involved in the regulation of Mcm10 protein expression. As illustrated in Figs. 1 and 3, Mcm10 displayed slower electrophoretic mobility at metaphase. To investigate whether this change is correlated with dissociation from chromatin, the electrophoretic mobility of Mcm10 during G2/M transition was investigated. HeLa cells were arrested at G1/S boundary by aphidicolin treatment following mitotic shake-off and resuspended in aphidicolin-free medium. Nocodazole was re-added 3 h after release from G1/S boundary to arrest cells at metaphase. Cell lysates were prepared at indicated times, and Mcm10 was detected by immunoblotting (Fig.4 A). As references of electrophoretic mobility, extracts from G1/S boundary and metaphase were loaded on the same gel. Mcm10 in insoluble fractions migrated faster, with no change in electrophoretic mobility. Levels of Mcm10 in soluble fractions increased after 6 h and migrated slower, as observed in metaphase extract. Interestingly, the change in electrophoretic mobility was associated with an increase in cyclin B1 and mitotic index (Fig. 4 B). Lamin B1 in the soluble form also increased concomitantly with cyclin B1 increase, concordant with the theory that phosphorylation of lamin proteins by cdc2 kinase is essential for the disassembly of nuclear lamina structure. As illustrated in Fig. 1, Mcm7 dissociated from chromatin during S phase progression. In contrast, Mcm10 and PCNA remained coupled to chromatin throughout S phase. Remarkably, most Mcm10 proteins bound chromatin when cells were arrested at G1/S boundary with aphidicolin (zero time), whereas substantial levels of PCNA proteins associated with chromatin after removal of aphidicolin. We speculate that Mcm10 may be phosphorylated upon dissociation from nuclease-resistant nuclear structures, since several cell cycle-regulating proteins undergo this modification in G2/M phase by mitotic kinases (32Coleman T.R. Dunphy W.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 877-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Treatment of metaphase extract with λ phosphatase converted the slow migrating form in metaphase extracts to a faster migrating form in S phase extract (Fig. 4 C). This modification was blocked by phosphatase inhibitors. The hyperphosphorylation of Mcm10 was not an artifact resulting from prolonged arrest at metaphase, since this process was also detected during cell release from G1/S boundary in the absence of nocodazole (data not shown). The function of Mcm10 in DNA replication is poorly understood, although several lines of evidence indicate that Mcm10 has multiple roles in DNA replication in budding yeast. In this report, we characterize the human Mcm10 protein in all stages of the cell cycle, and demonstrate that: 1) human Mcm10 protein levels fluctuate during the cell cycle and decrease in late M/G1 phase, 2) human Mcm10 binds chromatin specifically in S phase, and 3) dissociation of human Mcm10 from chromatin in G2/M phase is accompanied by protein phosphorylation. Interestingly, yeast Mcm10 displays different behavior to human Mcm10. Yeast Mcm10 binds chromatin during the entire cell cycle, with constant expression levels (25Homesley L. Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Sawyer S. Christensen T. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 913-926PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kawasaki Y. Hiraga S. Sugino A. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 975-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). No modifications of yeast Mcm10 have been reported to date. We therefore assume that Mcm10 function may be controlled by different mechanisms between species. Although the overall mechanism of DNA replication is well conserved among eukaryotes, different regulatory mechanisms for each replication factor are observed between yeast and higher eukaryotes. For example, yeast Orc stably binds to origins throughout the entire cell cycle (3Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar, 4Diffley J.F.X. Cocker J.H. Nature. 1992; 357: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), whereas the interactions of Xenopus and mammalian Orc with chromatin appear to vary (33Rowles A. Tada S. Blow J.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2011-2018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cdc6 is mainly regulated by degradation in yeast (19Drury L.S. Perkins G. Diffley J.F.X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5966-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), but modulated via localization in mammalian cells (20Saha P. Chen J. Thome K.C. Lawlis S.J. How Z. Hendricks M. Parvin J.D. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2758-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that mammalian cells have evolved a different regulatory system for Mcm10. Our present analyses reveal that human Mcm10 levels decrease in late M/G1 phase. The loss of Mcm10 in late M/G1 may be explained either by down-regulation of transcription or specific degradation. The rapid loss of Mcm10 at the end of mitosis was not mainly regulated at the transcriptional level, since Mcm10 mRNA levels increased in G1 phase. However, steady-state levels of Mcm10 increased after treatment with proteasome inhibitors, and down-regulation of Mcm10 in late M/G1 was not observed in the presence of proteasome inhibitor. Furthermore, two proteins were detected in immunoblotting, with similar expression patterns as that of Mcm10 protein. The apparent molecular weights of these two proteins were consistent with monoubiquitinated and diubiquitinated Mcm10. These data suggest that a significant fraction of Mcm10 is degraded by proteasome-mediated proteolysis in late M/G1 phase. Cell cycle-regulated proteolysis in anaphase depends on the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), a multisubunit ubiquitin ligase (E3) (34Sudakin V. Ganoth D. Dahan A. Heller H. Hershko J. Luca F.C. Ruderman J.V. Hershko A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 185-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). APC transfers ubiquitin onto cyclin B1, cyclin A, geminin, and securin in anaphase and regulates exit from mitosis (30Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1991; 349: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar, 31Zou H. McGarry T.J. Bernal T. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1999; 285: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 35McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). APC targets contain destruction boxes necessary for ubiquitination-mediated proteolysis (30Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1991; 349: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar). Mcm10 contains a sequence (REQLAYLES, amino acids 719 to 727) homologous to the cyclin A destruction box (RAALAVLKS). Recently, a new recognition sequence (KEN box; K-E-N) in Cdc20 and Cdc6 was identified as an APC target (36Pfleger C.M. Kirschner M.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 655-665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Petersen B.O. Wagener C. Marinoni F. Kramer E.R. Melixetian M. Denchi E.L. Gieffers C. Matteucci C. Peters J.-M. Helin K. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2330-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Mcm10 additionally contains a putative KEN box (amino acids 71–73), which is another candidate for ubiquitination. In addition, a computer analysis using PEST-FIND program allowed the identification of two putative PEST domains at the amino-terminal end of Mcm10 (amino acids 34–68 and 71–99), which are hypothesized as targets for degradation by 26 S proteasome (38Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar). Since Mcm10 is regulated by ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, it would be interesting to evaluate how ubiquitination is controlled in the cell cycle. One possibility is that replication factors interact with Mcm10 at G1/S boundary and protect the protein from polyubiquitination. Alternatively, ubiquitination may be coupled with phosphorylation. As discussed below, Mcm10 was dephosphorylated in late M phase, possibly providing a good substrate for ubiquitination. Remarkably, the monoubiquitinated form was dominant in insoluble fraction. Monoubiquitination requires E1 and E2 activities only, while polyubiquitination requires E3 activity (39Ciechanover A. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Therefore, the absence of the polyubiquitinated form in S phase may be due to the lack of APC activity in S phase. Dissociation of Mcm10 from chromatin was consistent with changes in electrophoretic mobility. Studies on Mcm10 modification revealed that λ phosphatase converted the slower migrating form in the metaphase extract to the faster migrating form in S phase extract. It seems that Mcm10 is phosphorylated by protein kinase(s) in G2/M phase, similar to Orc1 (40Tugal T. Zou-Yang X.H. Gavin K. Pappin D. Canas B. Kobayashi R. Hunt T. Stillman B. J. Biol.

Nature. 1996; 379: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), Mcm2, and Mcm4 (21Fujita M. Yamada C. Tsurumi T. Hanaoka F. Matsuzawa K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17095-17101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 43Todorov I.T. Attaran A. Kearsey S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1433-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). One possible kinase candidate is cdc2/cyclin B1, since the mobility shift of Mcm10 to a slower migrating form occurred in conjunction with an increase in cyclin B1. Mcm10 has several potential target sites for cdc2 kinase at its amino-terminal end. It is therefore likely that phosphorylation of Mcm10 by cdc2 kinase causes dissociation from chromatin, similar to the mechanism for Mcm2–7 complex (21Fujita M. Yamada C. Tsurumi T. Hanaoka F. Matsuzawa K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17095-17101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The issues of whether phosphorylation is essential for dissociation of Mcm10 from chromatin and cdc2 kinase directly phosphorylates Mcm10 require clarification. The role of mammalian Mcm10 in DNA replication is still obscure. Results presented in this report reveal that human Mcm10 is regulated by proteolysis and phosphorylation in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Consequently, a substantial amount of Mcm10 binds chromatin exclusively in S phase. Our data further suggest that Mcm10 is involved in S phase progression and is not a component of the prereplicative complex, inconsistent with previous observations in yeast. Homesley et al. (25Homesley L. Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Sawyer S. Christensen T. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 913-926PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the yeast Mcm2–7 complex is released from chromatin when the temperature-sensitive mcm10–43 mutant dissociates under non-permissive temperature conditions, suggesting that binding of Mcm10 to chromatin is essential for the loading of the Mcm2–7 complex (25Homesley L. Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Sawyer S. Christensen T. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 913-926PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast Mcm10 may have an additional function in pre-replicative complex formation. We cannot exclude the possibility that a small fraction of human Mcm10 that escaped degradation in late M/G1 phase, may be involved in the formation of prereplicative complex. However, further experiments are necessary to clarify these hypotheses. The functions of human Mcm10 during S phase progression remain unresolved so far. We have discovered that human Mcm10 interacts with the mammalian Orc and Mcm2–7 complex (28Izumi M. Yanagi K. Mizuno T. Yokoi M. Kawasaki Y. Moon K.-Y. Hurwitz J. Yatagai F. Hanaoka F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4769-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Mcm10 may react with those proteins to release Mcm2–7 complex from origins for triggering DNA replication. Recent findings in yeast indicate that Mcm10 genetically interacts with elongation factors including DNA polymerase δ, ε and Cdc45 (26Kawasaki Y. Hiraga S. Sugino A. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 975-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It is possible that Mcm10 facilitates the assembly of the replication complex or stabilizes replication machinery.

Many tissues and cell types contain several RGS proteins that possess similar GAP activity toward both Gαi and Gαq in vitro (8Gold S.J. Ni Y.G. Dohlman H.G. Nestler E.J. J.

This phenomenon provokes the question of whether some RGS proteins are redundant, and if so, how RGSs are differentially regulated within a given cell to modify a particular G protein or G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) pathway.

For instance, RGS4 and RGS16 are palmitoylated inSaccharomyces cerevisiae, but this modification is not required for plasma membrane association or regulation of pheromone signaling (15Srinivasa S.P.

RGS4, RGS7, and RGS10 expressed in Sf9 cells are palmitoylated on conserved cysteine residues, including one in the RGS box (Cys95 in RGS4, Cys66 in RGS10). In the case of RGS7, palmitoylation occurs only in the membrane-associated fraction (17Tu Y. Popov S. Slaughter C. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38260-38267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 18Rose J.R. Taylor J.B. Shi J. Cockett M.I. Jones P.G. Hepler J.R. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2103-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation of the RGS box cysteine in RGS4 or RGS10 either inhibits or potentiates GAP activity depending on how GTP hydrolysis is measured (single turnover versus receptor-stimulated activity in proteoliposomes) (17Tu Y. Popov S. Slaughter C. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38260-38267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 19Tu Y. Woodson J. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20160-20166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In HEK 293T cells, palmitoylation of conserved amino-terminal cysteine residues in RGS16 (Cys2, Cys12) does not affect its membrane attachment but is required for its ability to modulate both Gαi- and Gαq-mediated signaling (20Druey K.M.

Collectively, these studies indicate that regulation of RGS activity by a covalent modification such as palmitoylation is likely to be complex. RGS proteins may also be modified by Ser/Thr phosphorylation. The yeast RGS protein Sst2 undergoes pheromone-induced phosphorylation by MAPK, which slows its degradation (21Garrison T.R. Zhang Y.

RGS7 is phosphorylated on a conserved Ser residue by protein kinase C, which promotes interaction with 14-3-3 proteins and inhibition of RGS7 GAP activity (22Benzing T. Yaff M.B. Arnould T. Sellin L. Schermer B. Schilling B. Schreiber R. Kunzelmann K. Leparc G.G. Kim E. Walz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28167-28172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Similarly, protein kinase C-induced phosphorylation inhibits RGS2 GAP activity on Gαq (23Cunningham M.L. Waldo G.L. Hollinger S. Hepler J.R. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 5438-5444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In contrast, ERK2 phosphorylates RGS-Gα-interacting protein, which enhances its capacity to act as a GAP on Gαi3 (24Ogier-Denis E. Pattingre S. El Benna J. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39090-39095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Protein kinase A phosphorylates RGS10, which does not affect GAP activity but correlates with RGS10 translocation from the plasma membrane and cytosol to the nucleus (25Burgon P.G. Lee W.L. Nixon A.B. Peralta E.G. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32826-32834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (85) Google Scholar). RGS9–1 undergoes Ser phosphorylation by an unidentified endogenous kinase in rod outer segments (26Hu G. Jang G.-F. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22287-22295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Finally, RGS16 is phosphorylated on Ser-194 after epinephrine stimulation of cells expressing the α2A-adrenergic receptor (27Chen C. Wang H. Fong C.W. Lin S.-C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Mutation of this serine residue to alanine impairs RGS16 GAP activity and its regulation of epinephrine-stimulated MAPK activity in these cells, but the direct effect of RGS16 Ser phosphorylation on its GAP activity has not been determined. The current study shows that RGS16 GAP activity is regulated by phosphorylation of conserved tyrosine residues (Tyr168 and Tyr177) in the RGS box. EGFR phosphorylated RGS16 directly, which depended on the presence of residue Tyr168, because mutation of this residue to phenylalanine abolished EGFR-mediated phosphorylation in vitro. The Y168F mutation also diminished RGS16 GAP activity. RGS16 (Y177F) underwent phosphorylation similar to WT RGS16 after EGF stimulation and demonstrated normal GAP activity. However, neither tyrosine mutant effectively regulated Gi-GPCR-mediated MAPK activation or inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in vivo, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation is important for RGS16 function. EGFR-mediated phosphorylation of RGS16 suggests a novel form of cross-talk between receptor tyrosine kinase and G protein-coupled signaling pathways. HEK 293T cells were maintained in supplemented Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen/Life Technologies) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 20 ng/ml gentamicin, in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. For transfections, 2 × 106 cells were plated in 100-mm tissue culture dishes and transfected with appropriate plasmids for 18 h using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen/Life Technologies). After removal of the DNA mixture, the cells were incubated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/glutamine/0.1% BSA (Sigma Chemical Co.) until harvest 48 h after transfection. To generate recombinant RGS16, we subcloned anEco RI/Xho I fragment from pcDNA3-RGS16 into pET-28a (Novagen) in-frame with an amino-terminal hexahistidine tag. This plasmid was used as a PCR template for the production of the mutants described below. pET28a-RGS16 and pET15b-RGS2 were transformed into the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS strain (Stratagene), and proteins were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. Recombinant proteins were purified by Ni2+/nitriloacetic acid-Sepharose (Qiagen) affinity chromatography per the manufacturer’s instructions. pcDNA3-HA-RGS16 (human) was the kind gift of Drs.

We used the Y168F plasmid as a template for constructing Y168/Y177F. This plasmid was also used as a template to generate the complete RGS16 coding region by PCR, which was inserted into TOPO-pcDNA3-V5/His (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's protocol. Constructs were confirmed by automated sequencing. The EGF receptor construct was a gift of Dr. Amyn Habib (Harvard University), and the plasmid encoding m2R was the kind gift of Dr. Silvio Gutkind (NIDCR, National Institutes of Health). Native EGFR kinase purified from A431 cells by lectin chromatography was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. PD153035 (Compound 32) was purchased from Calbiochem. After hormone stimulation, we rinsed cells twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline before lysis in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.25% deoxycholate, 1 mm NaF, 1% Nonidet P-40 along with 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). We immunoprecipitated equal protein amounts (500–600 μg) with either rabbit polyclonal anti-HA (2 μg ml−1) or anti-EGFR Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Antigen-antibody complexes were recovered using sheep anti-rabbit IgG magnetic beads (Dynal). Cells transfected with RGS16-V5/His were lysed in buffer P (20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 15 mm imidazole, 1% Triton-X, 1 mm Na3VO4). We extracted RGS16 from lysates with a 30-μl slurry of Probond resin (Invitrogen). We washed the beads three times prior to addition of Laemmli buffer and SDS-PAGE. Antibodies against phospho-ERK, ERK1, EGFR, HA, and hexahistidine were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and anti-V5 was from Invitrogen. The signal was detected with Super Signal enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Polyclonal anti-RGS16 raised against human His6RGS16 was the gift of Dr. Carol Beadling (Cornell University Medical College). We carried out MAPK assays and measurements of receptor-stimulated cAMP as described previously except that cAMP levels were determined using the Biotrak radioimmunoassay as per the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (20Druey K.M.

We assayed RGS phosphorylation by incubating 10 pmol of His6RGS16 or His6RGS2 for 1 h at 30 °C with native, purified EGFR in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 1 mg ml−1 BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, and [γ-32P]ATP (200 μm, 30 Ci mmol−1). Reactions were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and gels were dried prior to autoradiography. The RGS16 band was excised and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The stoichiometry of phosphorylation was calculated based on the specific activity of [γ-32P]ATP and RGS16 concentration determined by Bradford assay. Average incorporation was 0.4 mol of phosphate per mol of RGS16−1, indicating the presence of a single phosphorylation site. We performed single turnover GTPase assays by loading recombinant, myristoylated Gαi1 (purchased from Calbiochem) with [γ-32P]GTP (1 μm, 50–100 cpm fmol−1) at 30 °C in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 8, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% C12E10 (buffer C). The reaction was chilled on ice before gel filtration on a Sepharose G-25 column that was equilibrated with buffer C plus BSA (0.1 mg ml−1). GTP hydrolysis was initiated by adding G protein to a tube containing unlabeled GTP (100 μm) and MgSO4 (10 mm) with or without RGS. Aliquots were removed at various time points from 10 s prior to start of the reaction (arbitrarily set as time zero) to 5 min and quenched in a chilled, activated charcoal/phosphoric acid slurry. Inorganic phosphate in supernatants was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry after centrifugation at 1500 × g. Net release of Pi was determined by subtracting the amount at time zero, and rate constants (k cat) were determined by fitting the data to a first order exponential function using SigmaPlot software (SSPI). Analysis of the amino acid sequence of mammalian RGS proteins revealed the presence of two highly conserved tyrosine residues that were potential sites of phosphorylation (TableI). To determine if RGS proteins underwent tyrosine phosphorylation in mammalian cells, we expressed HA-RGS2, RGS4, and RGS16 in HEK 293T cells and treated the cells with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium pervanadate. We immunoprecipitated RGS proteins with anti-HA antibody and immunoblotted them with anti-phosphotyrosine. Each of the three RGS proteins was phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in these cells after pervanadate treatment (Fig. 1). We studied the tyrosine phosphorylation of RGS16 in detail, because it contains only these two tyrosine residues.Table IRGS box-conserved tyrosine residuesAmino acid numbers are indicated in parentheses.

Open table in a new tab Amino acid numbers are indicated in parentheses. Conserved residues are highlighted in gray. Conserved tyrosine residues are in boldface. Asterisks mark residues that contact Gαi directly. To determine which extracellular stimuli induced RGS16 tyrosine phosphorylation, we transfected HEK 293T cells with a GPCR (m2 muscarinic), an RTK (EGFR), and HA-RGS16 and immunoblotted cell lysates with anti-phosphotyrosine. We detected tyrosine phosphorylation of HA-RGS16 in cells stimulated with carbachol (Fig.2 A). Surprisingly, EGF treatment induced strong RGS16 phosphorylation over a 1- to 15-min time period (Fig. 2 B and data not shown). To determine whether RGS16 phosphorylation was specific, we used a selective inhibitor of EGFR kinase activity, Compound 32 (Cp32), which completely blocked EGF-induced RGS16 phosphorylation. To exclude the possibility that EGF-induced RGS16 phosphorylation was related to EGFR overexpression or the HA epitope tag, we utilized another cell line with high levels of endogenous EGFR, COS-7, and transfected the cells with RGS16-V5/His. Recombinant RGS16 was extracted from detergent cell lysates by nickel affinity chromatography. In COS-7 cells, we observed phosphorylation of WT RGS16 after stimulation of endogenous EGFR, which was blocked by Cp32 (Fig. 2 C, lane 4) and was not observed when RGS16 contained mutations of both tyrosine residues to phenylalanine (Y168/Y177F, lane 5). EGFR phosphorylation induced by EGF treatment was verified by immunoblotting. Because EGF evoked strong RGS16 phosphorylation, we investigated which element of the EGFR signaling pathway was responsible for this effect and its potential role in GPCR-induced RGS16 phosphorylation. Because both GPCR and EGFR stimulation induce the activity of several non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as src or pyk2 (28Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar, 29Ma Y.-C. Huang J. Ali S. Lowry W. Huang X.-Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), it was important first to distinguish whether EGFR itself or a downstream kinase-mediated RGS16 phosphorylation. We hypothesized that if m2R-induced RGS16 tyrosine phosphorylation required EGFR kinase activity, Cp32 would block carbachol-induced RGS16 phosphorylation. Not only did Cp32 prevent EGF-induced RGS16 phosphorylation, but it blocked m2R-induced phosphorylation as well (Fig. 2 D), suggesting direct involvement of the EGFR kinase in RGS16 phosphorylation. To determine which one or more RGS16 residues were phosphorylated, we expressed HA-RGS16-containing tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations in HEK 293T cells and treated the cells with EGF. EGF induced comparable phosphorylation of RGS16 (WT) and Y177F, whereas Y168F was phosphorylated to a lesser extent, and Y168/Y177F was not phosphorylated (Fig. 3). These results indicate that both tyrosine residues may undergo phosphorylation after EGF treatment, although phosphorylation appeared to depend to a greater extent on the presence of residue Tyr168. To test whether the tyrosine residues were required for RGS16 regulation of GPCR-coupled MAPK activity in vivo, we measured m2R-induced MAPK activation in 293T cells expressing RGS16 (WT) or mutant proteins. There was no significant change in baseline MAPK activity in RGS16-transfected cells (Fig.4 A). Carbachol induced a 5-fold increase in MAPK activity, which was inhibited ∼70% by RGS16 (WT). In contrast, there was no significant difference in agonist-induced MAPK activation levels in cells transfected with empty vector or each of the three mutant proteins (Fig. 4 B). Differences between the activity of WT RGS16 and the tyrosine mutants were not likely due to a gross defect in RGS16 stability or localization, because all mutants were expressed at similar levels in detergent lysates (Fig. 4 B, bottom) and in 100,000 × g supernatants (data not shown). To ascertain whether the effect of the tyrosine mutations on RGS16 inhibition of Gi-mediated signaling was specific to the MAPK pathway, we tested the capacity of each mutant to regulate another Gi effector, adenylyl cyclase. We stimulated HEK 293T cells simultaneously through endogenous Gs- (β-adrenergic) and Gi-coupled (somatostatin) receptors and measured inhibition of isoproterenol-induced cAMP by somatostatin. In vector-transfected cells, somatostatin inhibited the isoproterenol response by 36.5 ± 1.9% (Fig. 4 C). In cells transfected with WT RGS16, cAMP generation was only inhibited by 8.1 ± 2.4%, indicating that RGS16 blocked Gi-mediated adenylyl cyclase inhibition (p < 0.0001). In contrast, we observed no significant diminution in somatostatin inhibition of the isoproterenol-induced response in cells transfected with each of the three mutant proteins. These data provide further evidence for the inability of Y168F, Y177F, or Y168/Y177F to regulate Gi-mediated signaling. To determine the biochemical mechanism underlying the impaired function of the mutants in vivo, we tested the ability of recombinant RGS16 (WT) and mutant proteins to act as GAPs for Gαi. GTP hydrolysis by Gαi1 (200 nm) was determined during a single catalytic turnover in the presence or absence of RGS protein. We measured k cat for GTPase reactions containing a range of RGS16 WT or mutant concentrations (5–200 nm). When these values were expressed as a percentage of k cat for reactions containing the WT protein, Y168F exhibited 73% and Y168/Y177F 60.3% of WT activity, whereas Y177F had GAP activity similar to WT (p < 0.05, Y168F or Y168/177F versus WT; no significant difference between these two mutants) (Fig.5). These data suggest that Tyr177 was not required for RGS16 GAP activity, whereas mutation of Tyr168 to phenylalanine impaired the GAP activity of RGS16. Because RGS16 tyrosine phosphorylation in 293T and COS-7 cells depended on EGFR kinase activity, we hypothesized that EGFR kinase phosphorylated RGS16 directly. To test this possibility, we incubated recombinant His6RGS16 with purified EGFR and [γ-32P]ATP. EGFR phosphorylated RGS16 (WT) but not RGS16 (Y168/177F) or His6RGS2 (Fig.6 A). To determine which residue might be phosphorylated by purified EGFR, single- or double-tyrosine mutants were incubated with the kinase and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine. WT RGS16 and Y177F were phosphorylated to a similar extent, whereas neither Y168F nor Y168/177F were phosphorylated (Fig. 6 B). This result suggests that EGFR phosphorylates RGS16 specifically on Tyr168, although these studies must be confirmed by phosphoamino acid mapping. To determine whether RGS16 interacted with EGFR in cells, we expressed the two proteins in 293T cells and immunoprecipitated EGFR with a specific antibody. A band corresponding to HA-RGS16 was observed in EGFR immunoprecipitates regardless of whether the cells were stimulated with EGF (Fig.7 A). This result suggested an association between RGS16 and EGFR that was independent of EGFR activation. To exclude the possibility that co-immunoprecipitation was a result of EGFR overexpression, we transfected COS-7 cells with RGS16 V5/His and extracted RGS16 protein with Ni2+ beads. After extensive washing, we immunoblotted for endogenous EGFR. EGFR bound only to beads containing RGS16 (Fig. 7 B). To test whether EGFR-mediated RGS16 phosphorylation affected RGS16 GAP activity directly, we measured Gαi1GTPase rates in the presence of RGS16 preincubated or not with purified EGFR. k cat for Gαi1 GTP hydrolysis at 4 °C was 0.006 ± 0.001 s−1. Rate constants for reactions containing RGS16 from 1 to 50 nm increased linearly, from 2- to 20-fold over basal rates. Surprisingly, at each RGS16 concentration, k cat values for reactions containing phosphorylated RGS16 (pRGS16) were nearly 2-fold higher than those containing unmodified RGS16, which was statistically significant (Fig. 8 A, p < 0.05, paired t test). To eliminate variability in rate constants due to different RGS16 preparations and differing stoichiometries of phosphorylation from individual reactions, we determined k cat values for reactions containing pRGS16 from independent phosphorylation assays. We normalized these values to rate constants for reactions containing unmodified RGS16. The average k cat for reactions containing 25 and 50 nm pRGS16 was 180% ± 0.3% of the control values (Fig.8 B, p < 0.05 between RGS16 and pRGS16; no statistical difference between the two concentrations). There was no effect of EGFR on RGS16 (Y168F) GAP activity. The EGFR preparation had no GTPase activity in the absence of G protein, nor did EGFR exhibit GAP activity toward Gαi1 (data not shown). Overall, these data suggest that EGFR-induced phosphorylation directly stimulated the GAP activity of RGS16. This study supports the notion that two conserved tyrosine residues in RGS16 are phosphorylated and necessary to regulate Gαi-mediated MAPK activation and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity. Because EGFR and RGS16 co-immunoprecipitated in two different cell lines and because EGF stimulation resulted in phosphorylation of RGS16 that depended on Tyr168 and, to a lesser extent, Tyr177, a functional interaction between EGFR and RGS16 likely exists. In addition, because EGF stimulation induces the activation of other tyrosine kinases, another enzyme could be responsible for phosphorylation of residue Tyr177, because purified EGFR did not phosphorylate RGS16 (Y168F). Alternatively, phosphorylation could depend on the presence of both tyrosine residues. Tyrosine phosphorylation regulates the activity of many G protein-signaling components. For example, a tyrosine-phosphorylated, G protein-dependent Ca2+ channel interacts with the phosphotyrosine binding domain of RGS12, resulting in enhanced G protein deactivation and attenuated channel activity (30Schiff M.L. Siderovski D.P. Jordan J.D. Brothers G. Snow B. De Vries L. Ortiz D.F. Diverse-Pierluissi M. Nature. 2000; 408: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Phosphotyrosines in the cytoplasmic tail of RTKs serve as a scaffold to which other signaling proteins are recruited (31Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3556) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation may also alter protein conformation to modulate activity, as is the case for src kinase (32Xu W. Doshi A. Lei M. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). We found that EGFR-mediated phosphorylation increased RGS16 GAP activity in vitro, suggesting that it might affect RGS16 conformation directly. NMR analysis of “free” RGS4versus RGS4 complexed with AlF4-Gαi1 indicates that a kink in helix 6 between residues Lys116 and Tyr119 (Lys165 to Tyr168 in RGS16) is more pronounced upon G protein binding (33Moy F.M. Chanda P.K. Cockett M.I. Edris W. Jones P.G. Mason K. Semus S. Powers R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7063-7073Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because Tyr168 is situated in this region and is located between RGS residues critical for Gα interaction (34Tesmer J.J. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), its phosphorylation could potentially play a role in this conformational change and modification of the RGS-Gα interface. Notably, the increase in pRGS16 activity is probably underestimated by our studies, (a) because of possible sub-maximal stoichiometry of RGS16 phosphorylation and (b) because of inherent limitations in single turnover GTPase assays. For example, RGS2 GAP activity toward Gαi is undetectable in traditional single turnover assays but becomes readily apparent when agonist-stimulated GTPase activity of Gαi is measured in proteoliposomes reconstituted with both a GPCR and heterotrimeric G protein (35Ingi T. Krumins A.M. Chidiac P. Brother G.M. Chung S. Snow B.E. Barnes C.A. Lanahan A.A. Siderovski D.P. Ross E.M. Gilman A.G. Worley P.F. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7178-7188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A similar strategy might uncover larger differences in RGS16 GAP activity in the presence and absence of phosphorylation. Interestingly, although RGS16 phosphorylation after stimulation of the Gi-linked m2R was relatively low, mutation of either tyrosine residue almost completely abolished the activity of RGS16 as an inhibitor of Gi-mediated signal transduction. This discrepancy might be explained by several factors. First, the Y168F mutation alone diminished RGS16 GAP activity in vitro and, thus, may contribute to the absent activity of RGS16(Y168F) in cells independent of phosphorylation. Second, fractional RGS16 phosphorylation after m2R stimulation may have been artificially low due to the high amounts of transfected RGS16 relative to the amount of tyrosine kinase available. Third, RGS16 overexpression may block m2R-induced EGFR transactivation, resulting in diminution of carbachol-induced RGS16 phosphorylation, because it depends on EGFR activation. In any case, the fact that significant differences in the activity of RGS16 versus phosphorylated RGS16 exist in the context of relatively weak phosphorylation argues for the vital importance of tyrosine phosphorylation to RGS16 biological function. Confirmation of these data awaits studies of endogenous RGS16 in native mammalian systems. Further evidence that tyrosine phosphorylation regulates RGS16 function is that residue Tyr177 also appears to be phosphorylated after EGF stimulation. Mutation of Tyr177 to phenylalanine prevented RGS16 from attenuating G protein-mediated MAPK activation or adenylyl cyclase inhibition without affecting GAP activity in vitro, suggesting that phosphorylation of Tyr177 might control another aspect of RGS16 function in cells. Phosphorylation could modify RGS16 localization, stability, or protein-protein interactions independent of its GAP activity. One such possibility is the alteration of interactions of pRGS16 with anionic membrane phospholipids, which may directly affect RGS GAP activity (19Tu Y. Woodson J. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20160-20166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Further studies will be needed to evaluate how phosphorylation of this residue affects RGS16 function and to determine which kinase is responsible for Tyr177 phosphorylation. Tyrosine phosphorylation could also influence the selectivity of RGS proteins in vivo. RGS2, -4, and -16 were phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in 293T cells after pervanadate treatment, yet EGFR selectively phosphorylated only RGS4 and RGS16 (Fig. 4 A and data not shown). The sequence upstream of the residue equivalent to Tyr168 in RGS2 differs from both RGS4 and 16 (Table I), suggesting that flanking sequences may determine kinase recognition. In addition, the residue analogous to RGS16 Tyr168 in RGS5 is Leu, implying that RGS5 is not phosphorylated by EGFR at this site. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation of select RGS proteins expressed in the same cell may determine their effect on a particular G protein or GPCR pathway. Unexpectedly, we found that GPCR-induced RGS16 phosphorylation was dependent upon on EGFR kinase activity. GPCRs activate a number of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases as well as RTKs such as EGFR (28Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J.

Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). For instance, both GTP-bound Gαi and Gαs stimulate src kinase activity directly (29Ma Y.-C. Huang J. Ali S. Lowry W. Huang X.-Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that m2R stimulation, which is coupled to Gαi, would induce strong RGS16 phosphorylation if src were the primary kinase involved. Instead, we found that m2R-mediated RGS16 phosphorylation required EGFR kinase activity. These results do not exclude a direct role for src or other kinases in RGS16 phosphorylation, however. Cross-talk between GPCRs and RTKs is well documented (36Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 37Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A.

Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). The mitogenic effects of Gi- or Gq-coupled receptors may require EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity (36Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 38Luttrell L.M. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that this RTK potentially inhibits G protein signaling in a feedback loop by enhancing the activity of a GAP. The rate of Gαi deactivation might be faster in the presence of phosphorylated RGS16, resulting in decreased downstream G protein effector stimulation. It will be of interest to determine if other RTKs (e.g. insulin receptor or platelet-derived growth factor receptor) phosphorylate RGS16 and to study the effect of EGFR-induced RGS16 phosphorylation on the activation of both RTK- and GPCR-induced biological end points.

In particular, the H-bonds formed between the peptide ligand and the MHC class II binding site appear to have a great influence on the half-life of the complex. Here we show that functional groups with the capacity to disrupt hydrogen bonds (e.g. -OH) can efficiently catalyze ligand exchange reactions on HLA-DR molecules. In conjunction with simple carrier molecules (such as propyl or benzyl residues), they trigger the release of low affinity ligands, which permits the rapid binding of peptides with higher affinity. Similar to HLA-DM, these compounds are able to influence the MHC class II ligand repertoire. In contrast to HLA-DM, however, these simple small molecules are still active at neutral pH. Under physiological conditions, they increase the number of “peptide-receptive” MHC class II molecules and facilitate exogenous peptide loading of dendritic cells.

Peptide ligands bind to the peptide-binding groove of MHC1 class II molecules by an array of intermolecular hydrogen bonds (H-bonds). These hydrogen bonds are mostly formed between the backbone of the peptide and conserved residues of the MHC class II molecule. Some of these H-bonds are particularly crucial for the stability of the ligand complex (1Stern L.J. Brown J.H. Jardetzky T.S. Gorga J.C. Urban R.G. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). It has been shown for a murine MHC class II molecule that the elimination of H-bonds between the ligand and residues His-81 or Asp-82 of the I-Ad β-chain results in a rapid loss of the bound peptide (2Ceman S. Wu S. Jardetzky T.S. Sant A.J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2139-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Detailed kinetic studies with these mutated MHC molecules revealed peptide dissociation rates that were increased up to 200-fold (3McFarland B.J. Beeson C. Sant A.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3567-3571PubMed Google Scholar). This increase was in the same range observed after addition of HLA-DM to the peptide complex of the nonmutated I-Ad molecule. It was therefore proposed that HLA-DM-mediated ligand release (4Sloan V.S. Cameron P. Porter G. Gammon M. Amaya M. Mellins E. Zaller D.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 5Weber D.A. Evavold B.D. Jensen P.E. Science. 1996; 274: 618-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) is also accomplished by the disruption of H-bonds (6Roche P.A. Science. 1996; 274: 526-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), a hypothesis also introduced when the crystal structure of HLA-DM was published (7Mosyak L. Zaller D.M. Wiley D.C. Immunity. 1998; 9: 377-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Because H-bonds appear to be fundamental in maintaining the stability of the MHC class II peptide complexes, we started to investigate small molecules capable of disrupting H-bonds with the goal of achieving an HLA-DM-like catalytic effect on the kinetics of peptide binding. H-bonds require a hydrogen donor and an acceptor group, which provides a free electron pair. Some of the functional groups that can fulfill this function are hydroxyl or amino groups. They are present in a variety of natural and synthetic molecules, such as lipids, metabolites, amino acids, and pharmaceutical drugs. One example is ethanol, where the well known physiological effects appear to result from subtle conformational changes of neurotransmitter receptors caused by the disruption of H-bonds (8Peoples R.W. Li C. Weight F.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 185-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 9Crews F.T. Morrow A.L. Criswell H. Breese G. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1996; 39: 283-367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To show that hydroxyl or other H-bond-forming functional groups (in conjunction with appropriate small carrier molecules) can in fact mimic the catalytic activity HLA-DM would not only provide additional support for the postulated function of H-bonds as a molecular basis of the mechanism (6Roche P.A. Science. 1996; 274: 526-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 7Mosyak L. Zaller D.M. Wiley D.C.

Small molecular compounds with peptide complex destabilizing capacity would also represent powerful tools to enhance the efficiency of HLA-DM-independent ligand exchange reactions, which take place, for example, on the cell surface of antigen presenting cells. A series of studies has already been published that describes successful immunotherapies based on the reinjection of antigen-loaded dendritic cells (DC) (11Zitvogel L. Mayordomo J.I. Tjandrawan T.

The major goal of these attempts is to deliver high amounts of immunogenic peptide antigens derived from tumor-specific or tumor-associated proteins. In addition to the benefit of increased loading rates, these small molecular catalysts would also allow the bypassing of proteolytic endosomal processing compartments, which facilitates the presentation of epitopes sensitive to proteolytic degradation when following the classical MHC class II presentation pathway. Previous studies have already shown that, under certain conditions, the stability of peptide-MHC complexes can be affected by detergents or detergent-like compounds (16Avva R.R. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1994; 1: 763-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 17Roof R.W. Luescher I.F. Unanue E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1735-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The mechanism, however, remained obscure, and the chemical nature of these compounds did not allow any experiments with living cells. In this study we tested the effect of simple H-bond donor/acceptor molecules, such as ethanol,n-propanol, phenol, and aniline on the ligand exchange of MHC class II molecules. By utilizing both soluble HLA-DR molecules and cellular in vitro systems, we evaluated the effect on the molecular level as well as under physiological conditions in cell assays (including T cell stimulation experiments). Because of potential implications for the induction of autoimmune reactions, autoantigens, such as the encephalitogenic MBP86–100 epitope (derived from the myelin basic protein), together with allelic forms of MHC class II molecules associated with the development of autoimmune diseases (e.g. HLA-DR2) were included in this study. Most reagents were obtained from Sigma (n-propanol, n-butanol, phenol,n-propylamine, aniline); para-chlorophenol was obtained from Fluka. The peptides IC106–120 (CLIP) (KMRMATPLLMQALPM) (18Chicz R.M.

For biotinylated peptides the biotin was attached to the N terminus of peptides, which were extended by a short amino acid spacer sequence (SGSG). All peptides were obtained from the Biopolymers Laboratory at Harvard Medical School. Soluble MHC class II molecules HLA-DR1 (DRA1*0101, DRB1*0101) (4Sloan V.S. Cameron P. Porter G. Gammon M.

Zaller D.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) were produced in S2 insect cells stably transfected with vectors encoding truncated MHC α and β chains, which lack cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains as described (4Sloan V.S. Cameron P. Porter G. Gammon M. Amaya M. Mellins E. Zaller D.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). S2 cells expressing HLA-DR1, HLA-DR2, and HLA-DM were provided by D. Wiley, K. Wucherpfennig, and D. Zaller, respectively. Complexes were formed in a volume of 6 μl by incubating 0.5 μg/ml HLA-DR with 0.16 μg/ml peptide ligand in the presence of 5% ethanol or 0.07 μg/ml soluble HLA-DM for 4 h at 37 °C at pH 5.0 (25 mmsodium acetate/sodium phosphate, 37.5 mm NaCl). After incubation pH was raised to 7.3, and after an additional 20 min at 37 °C the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE separation was done on a 4–15% Tris-glycine gradient gel (Bio-Rad) at 4 °C. Samples were loaded without prior boiling using a nonreducing sample buffer. A protein standard of 25–150 kDa (Novagen) was used as a marker. Protein bands were visualized by silver stain. Preformed CLIP peptide-HLA-DR complexes were generated by incubating 10 μl of HLA-DR (1 mg/ml) with 0.5 μl of biotinylated CLIP peptide (1 mg/ml) for 18–24 h at 37 °C. For peptide release experiments, the reaction was diluted 1:5 with phosphate-buffered saline. 4 μl of the dilution were mixed with 4 μl of buffer (100 mm Na2HPO4, 100 mm sodium acetate, 150 mm NaCl; the pH was adjusted to 5.0 or 7.3). Depending on the experiment, indicated amounts of excess peptide and/or catalyst (HLA-DM or small molecule) were added to a total volume of 10 μl. The reaction mixture was incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. In some release experiments, high amounts of high affinity peptides were added to prevent binding of already released CLIP peptide. The release reaction was added to ELISA plates, previously coated with an α-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody (L243, American Type Culture Collection) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Plates were washed and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with avidin coupled with peroxidase (Sigma). The amount of stable biotin-CLIP·HLA-DR complex was detected by using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories) and measured at 450 nm with a microplate reader (Dynex Technologies). In some experiments Eu3+-labeled streptavidin (DELFIA, Wallac) was used. In this case the detection was carried out by using a fluorescence enhancing solution (15 μm β-naphthoyltrifluoroacetone, 50 μmtri-n-octylphosphine oxide, 6.8 mm potassium hydrogen phthalate, 100 mm acetic acid, 0.1% Triton X-100), and the signal was measured with a Victor fluorescence reader (Wallac) using the time-resolved mode at an excitation wavelength of 340 nm and emission wavelength of 614 nm. Dendritic cells were isolated from the bone marrow of SJL/J mice (Jackson) and established by ex vivo differentiation of precursor cells as described (24Coligan J. Current Protocols in Immunology. Greene and Wiley, New York1992Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures were maintained in DMEM plus 5% FCS supplemented every 2 days with 10 ng/ml granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor. B cells, T cells, and granulocytes were removed by using rat monoclonal antibodies (PharMingen) B220/CD45R, CD90.2/Thy 1.2, and Ly6GGR-1/RB6–8C5, in conjunction with magnetic beads coated with sheep anti-rat IgG (Dynal, Great Neck, NY), first on initial isolation from bone marrow and again immediately before staining. Cell surface expression of empty MHC class II molecules was determined by flow cytometry as described (25Santambrogio L. Sato A.K. Carven G.J. Belyanskaya S.L. Strominger J.L. Stern L.J. Proc. Natl.

For peptide binding DC (5 × 105) were incubated at 37 °C in the absence or presence of peptide ligands in DMEM supplemented with or without 2% of n-propanol, 10 μm iodoacetamide, 1 μm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, 1 μm deoxyglucose for 4 h. For staining DC were incubated on ice with saturating amounts of primary antibody for 30 min in phosphate-buffered saline (150 mmNaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 12 mmNaN3, pH 7.2) containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 μm iodoacetamide, 1 μm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, 1 μm deoxyglucose and then washed, incubated with phycoerythrin-conjugated (Fab′)2 secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch) that had been preabsorbed with normal serum, washed again, and analyzed immediately by using a FACScalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson).

Fcγ receptor binding was blocked by preincubation with 1 μg of rat monoclonal antibody CD16/CD32 (PharMingen). MHC class II negative mouse L cells L929 (American Type Culture Collection) and fibroblast cells transfected with HLA-DR1 (L57.23; HLA-DRA1*0101, HLA-DRB1*0101; provided by E. Rosloniec) or HLA-DR2 (L466; HLA-DRA1*0101, HLA-DRB1*1501; provided by K. Wucherpfennig) were incubated with titrated amounts of biotinylated peptide ligands in DMEM plus 5% FCS supplemented with or without 2% n-propanol for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were then washed and stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin and analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScalibur instrument (Becton Dickinson). In some experiments, splenocytes from HLA-DR1 tg B10.M mice (provided by D. Zaller) were also used. HLA-DR-expressing fibroblast cells L57.23 (HLA-DR1) and L466 (HLA-DR2) were incubated for 4–6 h with titrated amounts of peptide antigens in DMEM plus 5% FCS supplemented with or without 2% n-propanol (5 × 104cells/well). The cells were then washed twice and incubated for 24 h with 5 × 104 cells/well of the MBP86–100-specific T cell hybridoma 08073 (provided by L. Fugger) or the HA306–318-specific CH7C17 T cells, a T cell receptor-transfected Jurkat cell line (provided by L. Stern with kind permission of L. R. Wedderburn) in DMEM plus 5% FCS. T cell response was determined by analyzing the interleukin-2 release in a secondary assay with CTLL cells (28Falk K. Rotzschke O. Santambrogio L. Dorf M.E. Brosnan C. Strominger J.L. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 717-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Ethanol is one of the simplest small molecules with H-bond forming capability (8Peoples R.W. Li C. Weight F.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 185-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To test the influence on peptide loading, soluble HLA-DR1 molecules were incubated with a high affinity peptide ligand (HA306–318) in the presence of ethanol or soluble HLA-DM. After 4 h of incubation, complex formation was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig.1). As expected the presence of HLA-DM significantly increased the amount of peptide complex (Fig. 1,lane 4). The band representing the SDS-stable HA306–318·HLA-DR1 complex was clearly evident in the HLA-DM-containing sample, whereas the band was much fainter when no catalyst was present (lane 2). However, the same effect was also evident when ethanol instead of HLA-DM was used (lane 3). The intensity of the staining of the band was even higher than in the HLA-DM sample, indicating that more peptide-MHC complex was generated by ethanol. Because ethanol displayed some HLA-DM-like catalytic activity in the loading experiment, the effect of the small molecule and of HLA-DM was further compared in ELISA experiments. In the experiment shown in Fig.2, the capacity of the two “catalysts” to exchange ligands was determined by the release of CLIP peptide from HLA-DR2 in the presence of titrated amounts of free peptides with different affinities to the HLA-DR2 molecule (MBP86–100, high affinity; IC106–120, medium affinity; HA306–318, low affinity). Because HLA-DM requires endosomal pH to exhibit optimal activity, the first part of the experiment was carried out at pH 5.0 (Fig.2A). As expected the influence of HLA-DM (middle panel) was most evident in the presence of the high affinity peptide MBP86–100. An almost complete release of the biotinylated CLIP peptide was detected at a concentration of only 10 μg/ml MBP86–100, whereas in the presence of the IC106–120 or HA306–318 peptide little difference to the noncatalyzed control reaction (upper panel) was observed. However, the same result was also obtained with 5% ethanol (lower panel). Ethanol catalyzed the exchange of CLIP by MBP86–100 but did not enhance the exchange by IC106–120 or HA306–318. Thus, ethanol can mediate the replacement of peptides according to their affinity. In contrast to HLA-DR2, a release of CLIP from HLA-DR1 by ethanol was not seen, which was due presumably to the higher affinity of the CLIP peptide to HLA-DR1 (data not shown). In the second part of this experiment, the effectiveness of HLA-DM and ethanol on the ligand release was tested under physiological conditions (Fig. 2B). It is known that HLA-DM molecules show little or no catalytic activity at pH 7.0 (4Sloan V.S. Cameron P. Porter G. Gammon M. Amaya M. Mellins E. Zaller D.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 29Sanderson F. Thomas C. Neefjes J. Trowsdale J.

Med. 1996; 184: 2153-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 31Sherman M.A. Weber D.A. Jensen P.E. Immunity. 1995; 3: 197-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In accordance with these reports, almost no release of biotinylated CLIP peptide from HLA-DR2 molecules was observed at pH 7.3. Approximately 80% of the CLIP·HLA-DR2 complexes were still detectable after the incubation with HLA-DM and 10 μg/ml MBP86–100. Compared with HLA-DM the ligand exchange capacity of ethanol appeared to be only slightly reduced at pH 7.0. After incubation with ethanol and 10 μg/ml high affinity peptide, less than 12% of the HLA-DR2 molecules were still loaded with CLIP. The different exchange capacity of ethanol and HLA-DM at neutral pH is presumably because of the fact that the dipole moment of ethanol's hydroxyl group remains unchanged upon pH shifts from 5.0 to 7.0, whereas conformational transitions abrogate the catalytic activity of the HLA-DM molecule. The previous experiments indicated that ethanol in principle showed the HLA-DM-like catalytic activity anticipated from an H-bond disrupting small molecule. The amount needed, however, was still relatively high. To identify more effective compounds, organic small molecules with various functional groups were tested. Most effective were hydroxyl groups in conjunction with hydrophobic carrier residues. For aliphatic residues it was found that the catalytic activity increased with the length of the chain (Fig. 3A). Methanol (C1) had virtually no effect, ethanol (C2) triggered a 50% release of the CLIP peptide at a concentration of 600 mm, n-propanol at 140 mm, and n-butanol (C4) at a concentration of 40 mm. The substitution of the hydroxyl group by (positively charged) amino groups resulted in a complete loss of catalytic activity. No release was therefore observed withn-propylamine (Fig. 3B, upper panel) or with n-octylamine (data not shown), one of the detergent-like compounds previously reported to affect full-length HLA-DR3 (16Avva R.R. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1994; 1: 763-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Additionally, no release was seen with ethanolamine, amino acids, and other charged molecules, indicating that the presence of charged substituents abrogates the effect even when located distant to the H-bond donor group. Another group of molecules that failed to induce exchange reactions were the so-called “chemical chaperones” (32Ghumman B. Bertram E.M. Watts T.H. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3262-3270PubMed Google Scholar), which included compounds like Me2SO, glycerol, and some other simple organic small molecules (data not shown). Aromatic compounds tended to be more effective ligand exchangers than aliphatic molecules. The activity of two of these compounds is shown in the lower panel of Fig. 3B. Phenol triggered a 50% release at a concentration of about 30 mm, and a similar effect was also seen with aniline (which carries an uncharged amino group because of mesomeric resonance). The requirement of a functional group with H-bond forming capacity is illustrated in Fig. 3C. Removal of the hydroxyl group or substitution of the hydrogen completely abrogated the effect, indicating that the small molecule has to function as an H-bond donor to affect the exchange rate of MHC class II molecules. Because small molecular H-bond donors retain effectiveness at neutral pH, they were tested in cell assays under physiological conditions. In contrast to the more potent phenol, n-propanol did not affect the viability of cells. A series of experiments was therefore conducted in which the influence of n-propanol on cell surface ligand exchange was determined with MHC class II-expressing antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells or transfected fibroblast cell lines. First, whether or not the exposure ofn-propanol results in the release of endogenous ligands was examined. Because such a release should lead to an increase in the amount of “empty” MHC molecules on the cell surface, the analysis was carried out by FACS using the conformation-specific KL304 antibody (27LaPan K.E. Klapper D.G. Frelinger J.A. Hybridoma. 1992; 11: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), which has been recently found to bind exclusively to empty MHC class II molecules (25Santambrogio L. Sato A.K. Carven G.J. Belyanskaya S.L. Strominger J.L. Stern L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15056-15061Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 26Santambrogio L. Sato A.K. Fischer F.R. Dorf M.E. Stern L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15050-15055Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). FACS analysis of murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells revealed that, after 4 h of incubation with 2% n-propanol, the amount of empty MHC class II molecules was indeed significantly increased (Fig.4A). The median fluorescence of the KL304 staining was 81, whereas, in the absence ofn-propanol, a value of only 38 was measured. To ensure that the incubation with n-propanol generated functional “peptide-receptive” MHC class II molecules that can be reloaded with high affinity peptides, the exposure of I-As-expressing dendritic cells was repeated in the presence of the PLP 139–151 peptide (Fig. 4B). KL304 staining revealed that, in the absence of n-propanol, the peptide caused only a slight reduction in the amount of empty MHC molecules. Only at the highest peptide concentration used (10 μg/ml) was a 26% decrease in the KL304 staining from a fluorescence median of 38 to 28 detected. With 2% n-propanol, however, the amount of detectable empty MHC class II decreased by almost 85% when the peptide was present during the incubation. The geometrical mean of the fluorescence of the KL304 staining was reduced from 81 (detected in the absence of the peptide) to 12 (detected with 10 μg/ml PLP139–151). Thus, n-propanol is able to generate functional empty MHC class II molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells, which can efficiently be loaded with high affinity peptide ligands. The peptide loading was further analyzed with biotinylated peptides (Fig. 5A). The staining with phycoerythrin-labeled streptavidin allowed direct determination of the amount of peptides bound on the cell surface by FACS analysis. For these experiments fibroblast cells expressing HLA-DR1 or HLA-DR2 were incubated with titrated amounts of biotin-HA306–318 and of biotin-MBP86–100 peptide, respectively. In the presence ofn-propanol, the staining of HA306–318 on HLA-DR1-expressing fibroblast cells increased ∼10-fold (upper panel), whereas for MBP86–100 and HLA-DR2 the increase was even 20-fold (lower panel). Here, a median fluorescence of ∼12 was determined at the highest peptide concentration used (1 μg/ml), whereas in the absence ofn-propanol only a value of 3 was measured. This value, however, was already reached at a peptide concentration of about 50 ng/ml in the presence of 2% n-propanol. Notably, no surface staining was detected on fibroblast cells not expressing MHC class II molecules, which confirmed that MHC class II molecules were indeed loaded with the peptides. As shown in Fig. 5B, T cell assays were used to test whether the increase in loading efficiency also translated into improved T cell responses. HLA-DR-expressing fibroblast cells were loaded with peptide antigens in the absence or presence of n-propanol and used to challenge CH7CH17 T cells, a Jurkat cell line transfected with T cell receptor specific for HLA-DR1/HA306–318 (33Wedderburn L.R. Searle S.J. Rees A.R. Lamb J.R. Owen M.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1654-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (upper panel), or the mouse T cell hybridoma 08073 specific for HLA-DR2/MBP86–100 (lower panel). In accordance with the previous peptide loading experiment, the HLA-DR1-restricted T cell response was triggered at ∼10-fold lower concentrations when 2%n-propanol was present during the incubation of the antigen presenting cell with the HA306–318 peptide. HLA-DR2-restricted T cells needed less than 1/20 of the peptide concentration to be stimulated when the loading of MBP86–100 was carried out in the presence ofn-propanol. The above cell experiments illustrate that the presence ofn-propanol significantly amplifies the T cell response by lowering the threshold concentration of the free antigen. To identify even more"

The tryptase ε gene resides on chromosome 16p13.3 within a 2.5-Mb complex of serine protease genes. Although at least 7 of the 14 genes in this complex encode enzymatically active proteases, only one tryptase ε-like gene was identified. The trachea and esophagus were found to contain the highest steady-state levels of the tryptase ε transcript in adult humans. Although the tryptase ε transcript was scarce in adult human lung, it was present in abundance in fetal lung. Thus, the tryptase ε gene is expressed in the airways in a developmentally regulated manner that is different from that of other human tryptase genes. At the cellular level, tryptase ε is a major product of normal pulmonary epithelial cells, as well as varied transformed epithelial cell lines. Enzymatically active tryptase ε is also constitutively secreted from these cells. The amino acid sequence of human tryptase ε is 38–44% identical to those of human tryptase α, tryptase βI, tryptase βII, tryptase βIII, transmembrane tryptase/tryptase γ, marapsin, and Esp-1/testisin.

It has been concluded that the tetramer unit evolved to physically restrict the substrate specificities of these six serine proteases, to prevent their rapid entrapment and inactivation by α macroglobulins, and/or to vary the extent a protein is degraded by the different combination of tryptase monomers. Using comparative protein structure modeling based on the crystallographic structure of pancreatic trypsin, Johnson and Barton (28Johnson D.A. Barton G.J. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 370-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) first noted that tetramer-forming tryptases have conserved Pro-, Tyr-, and Trp-rich domains on their surfaces. Analysis of its crystallographic structure revealed that the four monomers of a homotypic complex of human tryptase βII physically interact with one another via their Pro- and Tyr-rich domains (29Pereira P.J. Bergner A. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Huber R. Matschiner G. Fritz H. Sommerhoff C.P. Bode W. Nature. 1998; 392: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). hTMT and hEsp-1 lack the conserved Pro- and Tyr-rich domains. Instead, they contain membrane-spanning domains at their C termini. Thus, these two members of the chromosome 16p13.3 family of serine proteases are unable to form the tetramer unit. Despite the lack of conservation of the Pro, Tyr, and membrane-spanning domains, all proteases encoded by the genes residing at chromosome 16p13.3 contain the Trp-rich domain. Expression/site-directed mutagenesis studies carried out on recombinant mMCP-7 revealed that the Trp domain is required for the conversion of the inactive zymogen into an enzymatically active tryptase (27Huang C. Morales G. Vagi A. Chanasyk K. Ferrazzi M. Burklow C. Qiu W.T. Feyfant E. Šali A. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 351-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The presence of the Trp-rich domain in all mouse and human tryptases indicates the development >100 million years ago of a mechanism that is still used today in mammals to activate the varied members of the tryptase superfamily.

Even though the primary amino acid sequences of tryptases α and βII are 93% identical, it is now apparent that these two human MC proteases are functionally distinct due, in part, to a single amino acid difference in one of the seven loops that form their substrate-binding clefts (42Huang C.

Administration of recombinant human tryptase βI or mMCP-6, but not human tryptase α, confers protective immunity to MC-deficient W/Wvmice during a Klebsiella pneumoniae infection of the lung (43Huang C.

This effect is mediated, in part, by the ability of human tryptase βI and mMCP-6 to induce the selective extravasation of neutrophils into the bacteria-infected lungs. mMCP-7 regulates the extravasation of eosinophils (43Huang C. De Sanctis G.T. O'Brien P.J. Mizgerd J.P. Friend D.S. Drazen J.M. Brass L.F. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26276-26284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Because the α chain of fibrinogen is a physiologic substrate of mMCP-7 (40Huang C. Wong G.W. Ghildyal N. Gurish M.F. äali A. Matsumoto R. Qiu W.T. Stevens R.L. J. Biol.

Because of the potential roles of the MC proteases in asthma and other inflammatory diseases, low molecular weight inhibitors have been generated by pharmaceutical industries in an attempt to inactivate what was previously thought to be only one functional tryptase in the lungs of asthma patients. The first generation of tryptase inhibitors turned out to be nonspecific. For example, the most studied low molecular weight tryptase inhibitor, APC-366, actually inhibits pancreatic trypsin better than a human lung MC tryptase (44Clark J.M. Abraham W.M. Fishman C.E. Forteza R. Ahmed A. Cortes A. Warne R.L. Moore W.R. Tanaka R.D. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1995; 152: 2076-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The ability to create a second generation of more specific tryptase inhibitors is highly dependent on our knowledge of how many tryptase-like genes exist in humans and where and when these genes are expressed. This knowledge becomes attainable, in part, with the generation of the draft sequence of the human genome. We now describe the isolation, characterization, expression, and substrate specificity of the seventh functional member of the human chromosome 16p13.3 family of serine proteases. Our finding that human tryptase ε/PRSS22 3The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of our human tryptase ε/PRSS22 cDNA (GenBankTM accession no.AF321182) were released to the public on November 28, 2000. Although the gene is known as PRSS22 in the current draft of the human genome, the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee has indicated that it might be redesignated as PRSS26. is abundantly expressed in epithelial cells, in the adult trachea and esophagus, and in fetal lung suggests that this new human tryptase plays an important role in the airways. The nucleotide sequences of the human tryptase βI and TMT transcripts were used as templates to search for novel but related human tryptase-like ESTs in the GenBankTM data base. Sequence analyses of EST clonesBE907706 and AI249364 (derived from the human pancreas) revealed that their inserts correspond to overlapping portions of a new serine protease cDNA. Based on the deduced nucleotide sequences of the two truncated clones, a PCR approach was carried out on a pool of adult pancreas cDNAs and a pool of fetal kidney cDNAs (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) to isolate full-length human tryptase ε cDNAs. The oligonucleotides used in these PCRs were 5′-CCAGCCATGGTGGTTTCTGGAGCG-3′ and 5′-CTGGCCGCCTTTCAGATCCGAGC-3′. The resulting products were purified on 1% agarose gels and subcloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and the inserts in four arbitrarily selected clones were sequenced. To identify which human tissues contain the highest levels of tryptase ε mRNA, multi-tissue blots (CLONTECH) containing ∼2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from varied tissues were probed under conditions of high stringency with a radiolabeled 653-bp probe corresponding to nucleotides 431–1083 in the human tryptase ε cDNA. After the probe was random-primed with [α-32P]dCTP using the Rediprime kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), it was hybridized to each RNA blot at 65 °C for 2 h in QuickHyb solution. Each blot was washed twice at room temperature for 20 min in 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS and then twice at 65 °C for 20 min in 0.2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS before being exposed to BIOMAX film for 5–7 days. After the bound probe was removed, the blot was reprobed with a β-actin cDNA (CLONTECH) to evaluate the amount of RNA loaded in each lane. A PCR approach also was used to screen human transformed cell lines, tumor xenografts (CLONTECH), primary human airway epithelial cells (Clonetics, San Diego, CA), and primary microvascular endothelial cells (Clonetics) for the presence of human tryptase ε mRNA. The oligonucleotides 5′-CCAGCCATGGTGGTTTCTGGAGCG-3′ and 5′-GAGCCCTGGCTCGGTGCCCTGAG-3′ were used to generate the relevant 938-bp fragment. The obtained products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis, gel-purified, and sequenced to confirm the identity of the PCR products. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH)-derived oligonucleotides (CLONTECH) were used as a positive control in these transcript studies. The nucleotide sequences of the cDNAs that encode tryptase βI, βII, and α, TMT/tryptase γ, Esp-1/testisin, marapsin, and tryptase ε were aligned against the Human Genome Project's sequence of chromosome 16p13.3 using the “blastn” algorithm available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information Web site. Because human tryptases βI and βII are 98% identical (12Miller J.S. Moxley G. Schwartz L.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 864-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 13Vanderslice P.

AC003965), multiple tryptase ε-like genes could reside at chromosome 16p13.3. Thus, the draft sequence of the entire human chromosome 16 was searched using the translated “tblastn” algorithm for additional serine protease-like genes that encode peptide sequences flanking the catalytic triad His, Asp, and Ser residues in all functional serine proteases (i.e. WVLTAAHC, DIAL, or GDSGGPL; the residues forming the catalytic triad are underlined).

The 17-mer peptide Glu-Asp-Ser-Thr-Asp-Ser-Glu-Trp-Pro-Trp-Ile-Val-Ser-Ile-Gln-Lys-Asn corresponding to residues 5–21 in mature tryptase ε is not present in any protein in the GenBankTM protein data base. The model of the three-dimensional structure of tryptase ε predicts that residues 5–21 protrude from the surface of the folded tryptase. Thus, antibodies were raised in rabbits against the synthetic peptide by Genemed Synthesis (San Francisco); the resulting antibodies were purified using a peptide affinity column. Recombinant human tryptases ε, α, βI, and TMT were used in preliminary control studies to evaluate the specificity of the anti-tryptase ε antibodies. H358 cells contain tryptase ε mRNA but not SW579 cells. Thus, to evaluate whether tryptase ε is translated and constitutively exocytosed, the two epithelial cell lines were cultured in 10 ml of serum-free Opti-MEM I culture medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 24–48 h.

https://openalex.org/W1930206547,"cdk2·cyclin E and cdk5·p25 are two members of the cyclin-dependent kinase family that are potential therapeutic targets for oncology and Alzheimer’s disease, respectively. In this study we have investigated the mechanism for these enzymes. Kinases catalyze the transfer of phosphate from ATP to a protein acceptor, thus utilizing two substrates, ATP and the target protein. For a two-substrate reaction, possible kinetic mechanisms include: ping-pong, sequential random, or sequential ordered. To determine the kinetic mechanism of cdk2·GST-cyclin E and cdk5·GST-p25, kinase activity was measured in experiments in which concentrations of peptide and ATP substrates were varied in the presence of dead-end inhibitors. A peptide identical to the peptide substrate, but with a substitution of valine for the phosphoacceptor threonine, competed with substrate with a K i value of 0.6 mm. An aminopyrimidine, PNU 112455A, was identified in a screen for inhibitors of cdk2. Nonlinear least squares and Lineweaver-Burk analyses demonstrated that the inhibitor PNU 112455A was competitive with ATP with a K i value of 2 μm. In addition, a co-crystal of PNU 112455A with cdk2 showed that the inhibitor binds in the ATP binding pocket of the enzyme. Analysis of the inhibitor data demonstrated that both kinases use a sequential random mechanism, in which either ATP or peptide may bind first to the enzyme active site. For both kinases, the binding of the second substrate was shown to be anticooperative, in that the binding of the first substrate decreases the affinity of the second substrate. For cdk2·GST-cyclin E the kinetic parameters were determined to be K m, ATP = 3.6 ± 1.0 μm, K m, peptide = 4.6 ± 1.4 μm, and the anticooperativity factor, α = 130 ± 44. For cdk5·GST-p25, theK m, ATP = 3.2 ± 0.7 μm, K m, peptide = 1.6 ± 0.3 μm, and α = 7.2 ± 1.8. cdk2·cyclin E and cdk5·p25 are two members of the cyclin-dependent kinase family that are potential therapeutic targets for oncology and Alzheimer’s disease, respectively.

In addition to their role in maintaining normal homeostasis, there is increasing evidence implicating these enzymes in various diseases, such as cancer, neurodegeneration, and inflammation. Increased levels of enzymatic activity can lead to pathway deregulation, as exemplified by a number of oncogenic kinases, including Akt, Src, and Raf. The important role of kinases in health and disease has led to the suggestion that kinases may be good therapeutic targets (for review, see Refs. 1Hudkins R.L. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 773-903Google Scholar, 2Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In fact, inhibitors of several kinases, such as protein kinase C and p38 MAPK,1 are in clinical development as cancer and inflammation therapeutics, respectively (3Kaubisch A. Schwartz G.K. Cancer J. 2000; 6: 192-212PubMed Google Scholar,4Lee K.-Y. Qi Z., Yu, Y.P. Wang J.H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 951-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Two members of the cyclin-dependent kinase family, cdk2 and cdk5, have been implicated in cancer and Alzheimer's disease, respectively, and inhibitors of these kinases may prove to be clinically useful.cdk2 is a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase family, which binds cyclins A and E and regulates cell cycle progression (for review, see Refs. 5Morgan D. Ann. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1782) Google Scholar, 6Johnson D.G. Walker C.L. Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 295-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Disruption of the normal cell cycle is a hallmark of cancer, and deregulation of the cyclin·cdk complexes is associated with the disease (7Sandhu C. Slingerland J. Cancer Detect. Prev. 2000; 24: 107-118PubMed Google Scholar, 8Meijer L. Jezequel A. Ducommun B. Progress in Cell Cycle Research.vol. 4. Plenum Press, New York2000Crossref Google Scholar). For example, increased cdk2 kinase activity was detected in tumor tissues in a mouse mammary tumor model. In addition, cyclin E protein levels were increased in the tumor tissue, and a number of variant cyclin E isoforms also were detected in tumor, but not in normal tissues (9Said T.K. Medina D. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 823-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In human tissues, cyclin E levels have been shown to be increased in some breast, colon, and leukemic cancers. The inhibitory proteins p21, p27, and p16 are deleted or mutated in some tumor types, further supporting the idea that deregulation of cdk activity may contribute to oncogenesis (10Loden M. Nielsen N.H. Roos G. Emdin S.O. Landberg G. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2557-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 11Slingerland J. Pagano M. J. Cell.

Taken together, these results have led to the hypothesis that the cell cycle checkpoints are good points for therapeutic intervention. In fact, a number of cdk inhibitors currently are in phase I and phase II development as cancer therapeutics (13Garrett M.D. Fattaey A. Curr. Opin. Genet.

This tissue specificity is the result of the cdk5 activator proteins (p35, p25 (an N-terminally truncated form of p35), and p39), which are expressed only in brain (17Tang D. Yeung J. Lee K.-Y.

Results from a number of studies, including dominant negative mutant forms of cdk5 and knock-out mice, demonstrate that the cdk5·p35 complex plays an essential role in neurite outgrowth and neuronal differentiation (21Nikolic M. Dudek H. Kwon Y.T. Ramos Y.F.M. Tsai L.-H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 22Ohshima T. Ward J.M. Huh C.-G. Longenecker G. Veeranna F.G Pant H.C. Brady R.O.

A. 1996; 93: 11173-11178Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar).Increased cdk5·p35 kinase activity has been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease. Hyperphosphorylated tau protein is the major component of the neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) found in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brain, and in vitro experiments have demonstrated that cdk5·p35 phosphorylates sites on tau that are also phosphorylated on NFT tau (23Baumann K. Mandelkow E.-M. Biernat J. Piwnica-Worms H. Mandelkow E. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical experiments have shown that cdk5 co-localizes with NFT-tau in pretangle neurons (24Pei J.-J. Grundke-Iqbal I. Igbal K. Bogdanovic N. Winblad B. Cowburn R.F. Brain Res. 1998; 797: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and cdk5 enzyme activity in AD brain is increased ∼2-fold compared with tissue from age-matched controls (25Lee M.-S. Kwon Y.T. Li M. Peng J. Friedlander R.M. Tsai L.-H. Nature. 2000; 405: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Neurons from the brain tissue of AD patients have increased levels of p25, the truncated form of p35, and the p25·cdk5 complex shows increased tau phosphorylation, compared with the p35·cdk5 complex (26Patrick G.N. Zukerberg L. Nikolic M. Monte S. Dikkes P. Tsai L.-H. Nature. 1999; 402: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar). Cell death induced by amyloid β-peptide was inhibited both by a cdk inhibitor and a calpain inhibitor, suggesting that abnormal accumulation of p25 may contribute to cell death and AD pathology (25Lee M.-S. Kwon Y.T. Li M. Peng J. Friedlander R.M. Tsai L.-H. Nature. 2000; 405: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar).The role of cdk2 and cdk5 in proliferation and neuronal function has led to the idea that these kinases may be good therapeutic targets (27Martin-Castellanos C. Moreno S. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 95-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 28Meijer L. Drug Res.

However, a detailed understanding of the kinetic mechanisms by which these enzymes act is an important step in the rational design of inhibitors, but it has not been previously reported. A number of studies have been carried out identifying the kinetic mechanisms of various kinases (30Cook P.F. Neville M.E. Vrana K.E. Hartl F.T. Roskoski R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5794-5799Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 31Stein B. Yang M.X. Young D.B. Janknecht R. Hunter T. Murray B.W. Barbosa M.S. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10422-10427Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The results of these studies have been varied, and no one mechanism has emerged for all kinases. The majority of the kinases appear to act via a sequential and not a ping-pong mechanistic pathway, although both sequential random and sequential ordered mechanisms have been reported. In this study we have determined the mechanistic pathway for cdk2·cyclin E and cdk5·p25. As with other kinases, these enzymes utilize two substrates, ATP and protein (peptide). We show that both enzymes act via a random sequential mechanism, and furthermore, that the two substrates bind in an anticooperative fashion.RESULTSThe cdk2 and cdk5 substrate consensus sequence for phosphorylation is Ser/Thr-Pro-X-Arg/Lys (39Songyang Z. Blechner S. Hoagland N. Hoekstra M.F. Piwnica-Worms H. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 40Songyang Z. Lu K.P. Kwon Y.T.

Biol. 1996; 16: 6486-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). A number of peptides have been shown to serve as substrates for cdk2 and cdk5, and a peptide derived from histone H1, PKTPKKAKKL, was chosen for use in these studies (41Ando S. Ikuhara T. Kamata T. Sasaki Y. Hisanaga S. Kishimoto T. Ito H. Inagaki M. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 42Higashi H. Suzuki-Takahashi I. Taya Y. Segawa K. Nishimura S.

Cell Cycle Res. 1996; 2: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This peptide contains only one amino acid available for phosphorylation, which is desirable for kinetic experiments because the presence of multiple phosphorylation sites complicates the interpretation of results. Using the histone-derived substrate peptide and purified complexes of cdk2·GST-cyclin E and cdk5·GST-p25, time course experiments at 37 °C were carried out to establish the linear range of the assays. All subsequent assays were conducted at 37 °C for 20 min, which was within the linear range for the chosen enzyme concentration (data not shown).To determine the kinetic mechanism for the enzymes, replot analysis, as well as dead-end inhibitors were used. The two substrates, ATP and peptide, were varied within a single experiment, and the activities of cdk2·GST-cyclin E (Fig. 1 A) and cdk5·GST-p25 (Fig. 2 A) were measured. Each data set first was analyzed using equations describing ping-pong, random, and ordered mechanisms. The rapid equilibrium velocity equations describing these mechanisms are mathematically distinct with respect to their denominators (see “Experimental Procedures”), however, they cannot be used to discriminate between random and steady-state ordered pathways.Figure 2Data plots for cdk5·GST-p25.

In comparing the kinetic mechanisms, the most significant fit was determined through the use of sum of squares, the F test, and Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) (38Yamaoka K. Tanigawara Y. Nakagawa T. Uno T. J. Pharm. Dyn. 1981; 4: 879-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (2649) Google Scholar, 44Motulsky H.J. Ransnas L.A. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar, 45Akaike H. IEEE Trans. Automat. Contr. 1973; 19: 716-723Crossref Scopus (35074) Google Scholar, 46Yamaoka K. Nakagawa T. Uno T. J. Pharmacokinet. Biopharm. 1978; 6: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1939) Google Scholar). As shown by the very low sum of squares, 1.2, the random mechanism clearly gave the best fit to the data. However, because the velocity equation describing this mechanism contains one additional parameter as compared with the other pathways, the low sum of squares value alone is not sufficient as a basis for choosing the best fit model. The AIC is useful for distinguishing between models with differing numbers of parameters. In general, when comparing models with differing numbers of parameters the model with the least positive AIC is superior. The AIC for the random pathway ranged from 2- to 4-fold lower in the case of cdk2·GST-cyclin E and 4- to 8-fold lower in the case of cdk5·GST-p25, compared with the other pathways. On the basis of this comparison the random model was the most probable kinetic pathway for both cdk2·GST-cyclin E and cdk5·GST-p25. Finally, we applied an F test comparison of the random model to each of the other models. As can be seen by the very lowp values, in each case less than 0.01, the random pathway kinetic model fits the data for both cdk2·GST-cyclin E and cdk5·GST-p25 significantly better than either the ordered or ping-pong models.Table ISummary of statistical analysis of kinetic mechanismsEnzymeKinetic mechanismSum of squaresAICF testp valueCdk2·cyclin ERandom or steady-state ordered1.243Rapid equilibrium ordered, ATP binds first2.8200<0.01Rapid equilibrium ordered, peptide binds first6.9360<0.01Ping-pong2.6190<0.01Cdk5·p25Random or steady-state ordered3.047Rapid equilibrium ordered, ATP binds first160180<0.01Rapid equilibrium ordered, peptide binds first49140<0.01Ping-pong9.083<0.01 Open table in a new tab Replots of the data graphically demonstrate the mathematical differences between the velocity equations representing the three considered pathways. A plot ofK m/V max versus 1/[ATP] will have a slope of zero for a ping-pong pathway and a positive slope for a sequential system (either ordered or random). A plot of 1/V max versus 1/[ATP] will have a slope of zero for a rapid equilibrium ordered pathway and a positive slope for a random or a ping-pong system. Replots ofK m/V max versus 1/[ATP] and 1/V max versus 1/[ATP] for both cdk2·GST-cyclin E and cdk5·GST-p25 all had positive slopes, which are consistent with both enzymes acting by a random ordered substrate binding mechanism (Figs. 1 B,1 C, 2 B, and 2 C).When rapid equilibrium conditions prevail, the initial velocity equations for ping-pong, random, and ordered mechanisms are mathematically distinct, and the results presented in Table I and Figs.1 and 2 are sufficient for identifying the correct kinetic pathway. However, under a specific set of steady-state conditions the velocity equation describing an ordered mechanism becomes mathematically equivalent to that describing a random mechanism. For this to occur, the first order rate constant for the dissociation of the enzyme·ATP complex would have to be much smaller than the apparentk cat. The apparent k catfor a steady-state ordered mechanism where the concentration of products is zero is defined by the rate constant for the phosphotransferase step and all the rate constants for the enzyme·product dissociation steps. Although it seems unlikely that the dissociation of the enzyme·ATP complex would be significantly slower than the catalytic step and all subsequent product dissociation steps combined, this possibility cannot be ruled out on the basis of initial velocity data using enzymes and substrates alone.To differentiate conclusively between a random versus steady-state ordered kinetic mechanism, competitive inhibitors for both substrates (ATP and peptide) were used (47Fromm H.J. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 467-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). PNU 112455A is an aminopyrimidine (Fig. 3 A) identified as a cdk2 inhibitor during screening of the Pharmacia compound collection. The K i of this compound against cdk2·GST-cyclin E was 2.0 ± 0.2 μm (Fig.3 B), and for cdk5·GST-p25, it was 2.0 ± 0.3 μm (Fig. 3 C). Kinase specificity testing was carried out on a limited basis and demonstrated that PNU 112455A showed some selectivity as a cdk inhibitor. When tested at 100 μm, PNU 112455A did not inhibit the c-Met or insulin-like growth-1 receptor tyrosine kinases, or cAMP-dependent kinase. The MAPK family, like the cdks, consists of proline-directed protein kinases. However, no inhibition of ERK2 activity was observed with 100 μm PNU 112455A (data not shown).Figure 3PNU 112455A is an ATP-competitive cdk inhibitor.

Plots from experiments in which peptide substrate was varied demonstrated that PNU 112455A was a non-competitive inhibitor with respect to peptide (Fig. 3, D and E) for each of the enzymes.Crystals of cdk2 were soaked with PNU 112455A, and Fig.4 A shows a ribbon drawing of the least-squares superimposed cdk2 crystal structures containing the natural substrate, ATP, and the inhibitor PNU 112455A.

Experiments were carried out with cdk5·GST-p25 and peptide substrate, in the presence of varying amounts of the inhibitor (Fig.5 A). As expected, Lineweaver-Burk plots of this data demonstrated that inhibition by the PKV peptide was competitive with peptide substrate with aK i value of 0.6 ± 0.3 mm. The same competitive inhibition and K i value were observed using cdk2·GST-cyclin E (data not shown). In contrast, in experiments with either kinase in which the concentration of ATP was varied, the PKV peptide was a non-competitive inhibitor of ATP (Fig. 5,B and C). Taken together, the results with PNU 112455A showing non-competitive inhibition with respect to peptide substrate, as well as the PKV inhibitor results, fulfill the criteria for demonstrating that cdk2 and cdk5 both utilize a random kinetic pathway (47Fromm H.J.

Because much of our insight into caveolin-1 function has come from the study of human breast tumor-derived cell lines in culture, the normal physiological regulators of caveolin-1 expression in the mammary gland remain unknown. Here, we examine caveolin-1 expression in mice at different stages of mammary gland development. We show that caveolin-1 expression is significantly down-regulated during late pregnancy and lactation. Upon weaning, mammary gland expression of caveolin-1 rapidly returns to non-pregnant “steady-state” levels. Injection of virgin mice with a battery of hormones normally up-regulated during lactation demonstrates that prolactin is the main mediator of caveolin-1 down-regulation. Virtually identical results were obtained with human mammary epithelial cells (hTERT-HME1) in culture. In addition, we demonstrate that prolactin-mediated down-regulation of caveolin-1 expression occurs at the level of transcriptional control and via a Ras-dependent mechanism. Interestingly, in the mammary gland, both mammary epithelial cells and the surrounding mammary adipocytes show prolactin-mediated down-regulation of caveolin-1. This hormone-dependent regulation of caveolin-1 expression is specific to the mammary fat pad. Finally, we employed HC11 cells, a well-established model of mammary epithelial cell differentiation, to study the possible functional effects of caveolin-1 expression. In the presence of lactogenic hormones, recombinant expression of caveolin-1 in HC11 cells dramatically suppresses the induction of the promoter activity and the synthesis of β-casein, an established reporter of lactogenic differentiation and milk production. These findings may explain why caveolin-1 levels are normally down-regulated during lactation. This report is the first demonstration that caveolin-1 levels are down-regulated during a normal physiological event in vivo, i.e. lactation, because previous reports have only documented that down-regulation of caveolin-1 occurs during cell transformation and tumorigenesis.

Normal mammary gland development involves a complex interplay among growth factors, steroids, proto-oncogenes, and tumor suppressor genes (1Gallego M.I. Binart N. Robinson G.W. Okagaki R.

Invest. 1997; 100: 2744-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Development of the adult mammary gland can be divided into four distinct stages: non-pregnant, gestation, lactation, and involution. Gestation is characterized by rapid lobulo-alveolar outgrowth, whereas further proliferation and functional differentiation of the secretory epithelium are hallmarks of lactation. Finally, the end of weaning suppresses lactation and leads to involution of the lobulo-alveolar compartment, returning the mammary gland to its non-pregnant state (4Hennighausen L. Robinson G.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Dysregulation of these constituents can lead to mammary epithelial hyperplasia and ultimately to mammary tumorigenesis (5Engelman J.A. Lee R.J. Karnezis A. Bearss D.J. Webster M. Siegel P.

A possible role for caveolin-1 in mammary tumorigenesis was first identified using differential display and subtractive hybridization techniques. Sager and colleagues (6Sager R. Sheng S. Anisowicz A. Sotiropoulou G. Zou Z. Stenman G. Swisshelm K. Chen Z. Hendrix M.J.C. Pemberton P. Rafidi K. Ryan K. Cold Spring Harbor Sym. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) identified a number of “candidate tumor suppressor genes”; these are genes whose mRNAs were down-regulated in human mammary adenocarcinoma-derived cells. In this screening approach, caveolin-1 was independently identified as one of 26 gene products down-regulated during mammary tumorigenesis. In addition, caveolin-1 expression was absent in several transformed cell lines derived from human mammary carcinomas, including MT-1, MCF-7, ZR-75–1, T47D, MDA-MB-361, and MDA-MB-474. In contrast, caveolin-1 mRNA is abundantly expressed in normal mammary epithelium (6Sager R. Sheng S. Anisowicz A. Sotiropoulou G. Zou Z. Stenman G. Swisshelm K. Chen Z. Hendrix M.J.C. Pemberton P.

Chem. 1997; 272: 16374-16381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Since these initial observations, an increasing body of evidence has accumulated that supports the idea that caveolin-1 may function as a tumor suppressor in the mammary gland. For example, Lee et al. (8Lee S.W. Reimer C.L. Oh P. Campbel l.D.B. Schnitzer J.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1391-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) demonstrated that exogenous expression of caveolin-1 in human breast cancer-derived cells (T-47D) leads to a 50% reduction in cell proliferation and a 15-fold reduction in anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. Furthermore, p53-null fibroblasts express virtually undetectable levels of caveolin-1 (8Lee S.W. Reimer C.L. Oh P. Campbel l.D.B. Schnitzer J.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1391-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Mutation and/or amplification of the NEU proto-oncogene occurs in a significant number of human mammary tumors (up to 30%). Mutational activation of the NEU proto-oncogene (NEU T) was shown to have a reciprocal relationship with caveolin-1 expression. Activated mutants of the c-Neu protein expressed in NIH-3T3 and Rat1 cells caused a dramatic down-regulation of caveolin-1 protein expression. In addition, mammary tumors derived from Neu transgenic mice displayed a dramatic reduction in caveolin-1 expression. Conversely, recombinant expression of caveolin-1 is sufficient to block Neu-mediated signal transduction, via the caveolin-1 scaffolding domain (5Engelman J.A. Lee R.J. Karnezis A. Bearss D.J. Webster M. Siegel P. Muller W.J. Windle J.J. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20448-20455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 expression also diminishes the metastatic potential of the mammary tumor cell line, MTLn3. MTLn3 cells were originally derived from a metastatic rat mammary adenocarcinoma. In response to EGF,1 MTLn3 cells undergo lamellipodia extension and increased chemotaxis. However, recombinant expression of caveolin-1 in MTLn3 cells blocks EGF-induced lamellipodia extension and cell migration. Thus, expression of caveolin-1 in MTLn3 cells induces a non-motile phenotype (9Zhang W. Razani B. Altschuler Y. Bouzahzah B. Mostov K.E. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20717-20725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To further investigate the possible clinical significance of caveolin-1 in mammary tumorigenesis, Hayashi et al. (10Hayashi K. Matsuda S. Machida K. Yamamoto T. Fukuda Y. Nimura Y. Hayakawa T. Hamaguchi M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2361-2364PubMed Google Scholar) screened 92 human breast cancer samples for a mutation in the caveolin-1 gene. Their results identified a mutation at residue 132 (P132L) in 16% of the samples tested. The mutation most closely correlated with invasive scirrhous carcinomas. NIH-3T3 cells, stably expressing the caveolin-1 (P132L) mutant, demonstrated increased growth in soft agar, hyperactivation of the Ras-p42/44 MAPK cascade, and an altered cellular morphology due to disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. These results emphasize the importance of wild-type caveolin-1 gene expression in the normal regulation of mammary epithelial cell proliferation (10Hayashi K. Matsuda S. Machida K. Yamamoto T. Fukuda Y. Nimura Y. Hayakawa T. Hamaguchi M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2361-2364PubMed Google Scholar). From the above studies, it is clear that caveolin-1 assumes a dynamic role in regulating mammary epithelial cell proliferation. However, the normal physiological regulators of caveolin-1 expression in vivo remain obscure. To identify these in vivo regulators, we analyzed the expression levels of caveolin-1 in the adult mouse mammary gland during different stages of its development. Through this analysis, we expected to find a stage of development in which caveolin-1 levels are normally up-regulated or down-regulated. This would allow us to then identify the hormonal regulators that control caveolin-1 expression. Here, we demonstrate that caveolin-1 expression is significantly down-regulated in the mammary gland during late pregnancy and lactation. Injection of virgin mice with a battery of hormones normally up-regulated during lactation demonstrates that prolactin is the main mediator of caveolin-1 down-regulation. Furthermore, we show that prolactin negatively regulates caveolin-1 expression via a Ras-p42/44-MAPK-dependent mechanism. Finally, we employed HC11 cells, a well-established model of mammary epithelial cell differentiation, to study the possible functional effects of caveolin-1 expression. In the presence of lactogenic hormones, recombinant expression of caveolin-1 in HC11 cells dramatically suppresses the induction of bothβ-casein promoter activity and β-casein synthesis, as revealed by quantitative RT-PCR. β-Casein is an established marker of differentiation and milk production. This report is the first demonstration that caveolin-1 levels are down-regulated during a normal physiological event in vivo, because previous reports have only documented that down-regulation of caveolin-1 occurs during cell transformation and tumorigenesis.

Cells were cultured in their respective media and allowed to reach ∼80–90% confluency. Subsequently, they were washed with PBS and treated with lysis buffer (10 mmTris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 60 mm octyl glucoside) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For protein isolation from tissue, 100 mg of the excised mammary gland was homogenized in lysis buffer. Cell and tissue lysates were then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min to remove insoluble debris. Protein concentrations were quantified using the BCA reagent (Pierce) and the volume required for 10 μg of protein determined. Samples were then separated by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose membranes were stained with Ponceau S (to visualize protein bands) followed by immunoblot analysis. All subsequent wash buffers contained 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, which was supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin and 2% nonfat dry milk (Carnation) for the blocking solution and 1% bovine serum albumin for the antibody diluent. Primary antibodies were used at a 1:500 dilution. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000 dilution, Pierce) were used to visualize bound primary antibodies with the Supersignal chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). Total RNA was extracted from 100 mg of tissue from each sample using the TRIzol reagent protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Twenty micrograms of total RNA for each sample was separated using a 1.2% agarose gel under RNase-free conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose. The filters were hybridized using the ExpressHyb solution (CLONTECH). The blots were probed with the radiolabeled caveolin-1 cDNA.

Chem. 1989; 264: 14840-14847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this way, the affect of various signal transduction pathways on the regulation of caveolin-1 at the transcriptional level could be assessed. Transient transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, 150,000 hTERT-HME1 or HC11 cells were seeded in 6-well plates 12–24 h prior to transfection. Each well was then transfected with 1.0 μg of the indicated luciferase reporter and 0.2 μg of pSV-β-gal (Promega). The pSV-β-gal, an SV40-driven vector expressing β-galactosidase, was used as a control for transfection efficiency. 0.5 μg of pCB7 or pCB7-caveolin-1 was co-transfected where indicated. For hTERT-HME1 cells: At 12 h post-transfection, the cells were rinsed once with PBS and incubated in PRF-CDS DMEM with 10 μg/ml prolactin for 48 h. The cells were lysed in 200 μl of extraction buffer, 100 μl of which was used to measure luciferase activity, as described previously (23Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Hollenberg A. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31090-31096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another 50 μl of the lysate was used to conduct a β-galactosidase assay, as described previously (24Subramaniam A. Gulick J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13986-13994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each experimental value has been normalized using its respective β-galactosidase activity and represents the average of two separate transfections performed in parallel; the error bars in the figures represent the observed standard deviation. All experiments were performed at least three times independently and yielded virtually identical results. For HC11 cells: see above for hormone treatment. Conditions for adenoviral transduction of cells were optimized by immunofluorescence and immunoblot analysis so that relatively high protein expression was achieved without toxicity to the cells. 2D. S. Park, H. Lee, C. Riedel, J. Hulit, P. E. Scherer, R. G. Pestell, and M. P. Lisanti, unpublished observations. Twenty-four hours prior to infection, ∼3 × 106 HC11 cells were plated in 10-cm dishes. At the time of infection, cells were washed once with PBS and incubated for 1 h with serum-free media containing either Ad-Cav-1 + Ad-tTA (100 + 100 plaque-forming units/cell, respectively) or Ad-GFP + Ad-tTA (100 + 100 plaque-forming units/cell, respectively). Cells were then washed with PBS and maintained in HC11 growth media. Total cellular RNA was extracted from HC11 cells using the TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD). Total RNA (2 μg) was reverse-transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus-RT (Life Technologies, Inc., Life-Technologies, Inc.) oligo(dT) primers at 37 °C for 1 h. β-Casein-specific primers for RT-PCR were as described previously (1Gallego M.I. Binart N. Robinson G.W. Okagaki R. Coschigano K.T. Perry J. Kopchick J.J. Oka T. Kelly P.A. Hennighausen L. Dev.

Binart N. Robinson G.W. Okagaki R. Coschigano K.T. Perry J. Kopchick J.J. Oka T. Kelly P.A. Hennighausen L. Dev. Biol. 2001; 229: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA was used as a positive internal control, with RGAPH-1 (GTG AAG GTC GGT GTG AAC GGA TTT GGC CGT), nucleotides 50–76, and RGAPH-2 (CCA CCA CCC TGT TGC TGT AG), nucleotides 997–1016. As a negative internal control, equal amounts of RNA were amplified for 28 or 35 cycles using CasYP and CasYM without reverse transcription (1Gallego M.I. Binart N. Robinson G.W. Okagaki R.

Mammary epithelial cells and adipocytes were separated as described elsewhere (25Nedergaard J. Ailhaud G. Adipose Tissue Protocols. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 203-204Google Scholar). Briefly, mammary glands (4 and 5) were excised from 10- to 12-week-old virgin, day 15 pregnant, day 10 lactating, and day 4 post-weaning C57Bl/6 mice. Samples were then immersed in Hanks’ balanced saline solution supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and gentamicin (50 μg/ml). Tissue samples were minced and digested using type I collagenase (1 mg/ml). Digestions were performed in a 50-cc conical tube on a shaker at 37 °C for 30–60 min. After collagenase treatment, the slurry was passed through a 350-μm nylon mesh, and samples were centrifuged at 500 × g for 1 min to separate the parenchymal fraction from the floating adipocyte fraction. The pelleted samples and the floating adipocytes were washed three times in Hanks’ balanced saline solution (25Nedergaard J. Ailhaud G. Adipose Tissue Protocols. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 203-204Google Scholar). The samples were then treated with lysis buffer (see above) and examined by immunoblot analysis. Because caveolin-1 has been shown to act as an inhibitor of mitogenesis in cultured cells, we examined the expression of caveolin-1 during mammary gland development. Rapid expansion of the lobulo-alveolar compartment occurs during pregnancy and continues throughout lactation. Therefore, we initially examined caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 protein levels during these developmental stages of the mammary gland. C57Bl/6 mice between the ages of 10 and 12 weeks were sacrificed on day 16 of pregnancy and day 10 of lactation, with virgin mice being sacrificed as controls. The mammary glands were then excised, and caveolin protein levels were assessed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1, initial screening revealed that caveolin-1 protein levels are significantly down-regulated during lactation, whereas a more modest reduction of caveolin-1 expression is seen during pregnancy. Although caveolin-2 levels are also mildly down-regulated, repression of caveolin-2 is much less dramatic than that of caveolin-1. Additional time points, spanning pregnancy to involution, were added to characterize the initiation, duration, and termination of caveolin-1 repression. As shown in Fig.2 A, the first and second trimesters of pregnancy (days 1–14) are characterized by a gradual decrease of caveolin-1 levels, whereas the third trimester (days 15–21) displays a more pronounced decrease of caveolin-1 expression. This pronounced down-regulation of caveolin-1 protein levels continues throughout lactation (Fig. 2 B). With the termination of suckling and the onset of involution, caveolin-1 expression briskly returns to non-pregnant levels. In addition, caveolin-3 expression (a muscle-specific caveolin gene) is up-regulated during lactation, presumably due to terminal differentiation of the myo-epithelial cells. To determine at what molecular level lactation regulates caveolin-1 expression, Northern blot analyses were performed on the same mammary gland samples. As Fig. 3 illustrates, caveolin-1 mRNA transcript levels fall dramatically with the onset of lactation. On the third day of weaning, transcript levels begin to re-emerge and then fully return to non-pregnant levels by day 6 of weaning. To examine if the caveolin-1 protein is secreted into milk, samples were collected and examined for the presence of caveolin-1. However, no detectable levels of caveolin-1 were found in milk samples (not shown). During pregnancy, a complex array of ovarian and pituitary hormones, such as progesterone, prolactin, and oxytocin, stimulate the development of the lobulo-alveolar compartment within the mammary gland. Upon parturition, progesterone levels fall sharply, while prolactin and oxytocin levels remain elevated; this is a hallmark of the beginning of lactation. Suckling maintains high levels of prolactin and oxytocin secretion throughout lactation (26Higuchi T. Honda K. Fukuoka T. Negoro H. Hosono Y. Nishida E. Endocrinol. Jpn. 1983; 30: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To dissect the hormonal regulation of caveolin-1 expression observed in the lactating mammary gland, 10- to 12-week-old virgin mice were treated with subcutaneous injections of prolactin, oxytocin, or PBS alone. Fig.4 demonstrates that, although oxytocin treatment moderately decreases caveolin-1 expression in comparison with PBS-treated mice, prolactin injection markedly reduced the caveolin-1 protein to nearly undetectable levels. To further characterize the effects of prolactin and oxytocin on mammary epithelial cells, hTERT-HME1 cells were utilized. hTERT-HME1 cells are derived from primary human mammary epithelial cells that have been immortalized by stable transfection with human telomerase. This particular cell line has been well characterized and displays expression patterns and behaviors similar to non-immortalized primary mammary epithelial cells (13Clontech, Inc. CLONTECHniques. 2000; 15: 1-2Google Scholar, 14Clontech, Inc. CLONTECHniques. 2000; 14: 2-3Google Scholar). Consistent with the idea that hTERT-HME1 cells are immortalized but not oncogenically transformed, these cells abundantly express caveolin-1. There is a distinct lack of caveolin-1 expression in all previously studied breast cancer-derived cell lines. Therefore, this cell line is ideal for studying the effects of various hormones on caveolin-1 expression in culture. hTERT-HME1 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of oxytocin (0–10"
https://openalex.org/W2006272522,"It is now well accepted that G protein-coupled receptors activated by agonist binding become targets for phosphorylation, leading to desensitization of the receptor. Using a series of phosphorylation deficient mutants of the N-formyl peptide receptor (FPR), we have explored the role of phosphorylation on the ability of the receptor to interact with G proteins and arrestins. Using a fluorometric assay in conjunction with solubilized receptors, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of the wild type FPR lowers its affinity for G protein, whereas mutant receptors lacking four potential phosphorylation sites retain their ability to couple to G protein. Phosphorylated mutant receptors lacking only two potential phosphorylation sites are again unable to couple to G protein. Furthermore, whereas stimulated wild type FPR in whole cells colocalizes with arrestin-2, and the solubilized, phosphorylated FPR binds arrestin-2, the stimulated receptors lacking four potential phosphorylation sites display no interaction with arrestin-2. However, the mutant receptors lacking only two potential phosphorylation sites are restored in their ability to bind and colocalize with arrestin-2. Thus, there is a submaximal threshold of FPR phosphorylation that simultaneously results in an inhibition of G protein binding and an induction of arrestin binding. These results are the first to demonstrate that less than maximal levels of receptor phosphorylation can block G protein binding, independent of arrestin binding. We therefore propose that phosphorylation alone may be sufficient to desensitize the FPR in vivo, raising the possibility that for certain G protein-coupled receptors, desensitization may not be the primary function of arrestin. It is now well accepted that G protein-coupled receptors activated by agonist binding become targets for phosphorylation, leading to desensitization of the receptor.

G protein-coupled receptor fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-Lys N-formyl peptide receptor guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate wild type 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)1 comprise the largest class of membrane-expressed receptors. They transduce signals from the extracellular environment via interactions with a wide variety of agonists, including single amino acids, small peptides, hormones, lipids, odorants, and photons of light. The life cycle of the class I, rhodopsin-like GPCR has been well described (1Koenig J.A. Edwardson J.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 276-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 2Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Receptors and Channels. 1997; 5: 193-199PubMed Google Scholar). Following synthesis and export to the cell surface, interaction with an agonist induces a conformational change in the receptor resulting in activation of a G protein. Activated receptors are then targeted by a member of the GPCR kinase family (2Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Once phosphorylated, receptors undergo desensitization and internalization, followed either by recycling of the dephosphorylated receptors to the cell surface or degradation. Phosphorylation of the receptor is believed not to be sufficient to fully desensitize the receptor; it does, however, increase the affinity of the receptor for a family of molecules called arrestins (4Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne-Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 720-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 5Lohse M.J.

The coupling of an arrestin molecule with a phosphorylated receptor sterically inhibits further interaction with G proteins, resulting in termination of G protein activation. For many GPCRs, arrestins also act as accessory molecules for endocytosis, targeting receptors to clathrin-coated pits (6Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). Other receptors appear to internalize through alternative routes that are independent of both arrestin and clathrin (7Gilbert T.L. Bennett T.A. Maestas D.C. Cimino D.F. Prossnitz E.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 8Roseberry A.G. Hosey M.M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 739-746PubMed Google Scholar). A more widespread role for arrestins as scaffolds and adapter proteins has been recently identified, linking them with activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, in addition to regulating receptor trafficking (9Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The N-formyl peptide receptor (FPR) is a member of the chemokine/chemoattractant subfamily of GPCR. The FPR is expressed predominantly on granulocytes, specifically recognizes bacterially generated N-formyl peptides, and interacts with a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein (10Prossnitz E.R. Ye R.D. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 74: 73-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Agonist binding to the FPR activates the granulocyte, initiating several second messenger systems that result in the activation of integrins, cell adhesion to the endothelium, diapedesis and chemotaxis, and ultimately superoxide production and release of granule contents at the site of inflammation (10Prossnitz E.R. Ye R.D. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 74: 73-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). These functions constitute the first line of host defense in response to a bacterial challenge. Inappropriate granulocyte activation has also been identified as the major cause of tissue damage in several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (11Davies E.V. Hallett M.B. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 1: 485-490PubMed Google Scholar, 12Jordan J.E. Zhao Z.Q. Vinten-Johansen J. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 43: 860-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 13Ricevuti G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 832: 426-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Precise control of receptor inactivation and processing is necessary to limit the response and enable the cell to function effectively. FPR phosphorylation has been demonstrated to be necessary for both receptor desensitization and internalization (14Maestes D.C. Potter R.M. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29791-29795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation targets appear to be two clusters of four serine and threonine residues, each preceded by one or two acidic residues, in the C-terminal tail domain. The site containing Ser328, Thr329, Thr331, and Ser332 is referred to as the A site, and residues Thr334, Thr336, Ser338, and Thr339 comprise the B site (see Fig. 1). Several FPR phosphorylation-deficient mutants have been previously generated and characterized with regards to Ca2+ mobilization, receptor phosphorylation, desensitization, and internalization (14Maestes D.C. Potter R.M. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29791-29795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This work has demonstrated that although receptor desensitization and internalization are both dependent on phosphorylation, desensitization is not necessary for internalization, indicating that the two mechanisms are independent processes. Protein phosphorylation plays a key role in intracellular signaling, altering the charge and/or conformation of substrate proteins. Increasing the average levels of phosphorylation of the visual GPCR rhodopsin results in an increase in affinity for arrestin and also appears to diminish the affinity of the receptor for G protein (15Wilden U. Hall S.W. Kuhn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar,16Gibson S.K. Parkes J.H. Liebman P.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5738-5749Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, these results, generated by varying the stimulation time of the receptor, are difficult to interpret because of the heterogeneity of the sites phosphorylated. Numerous other GPCRs have been shown to colocalize with arrestin only in the activated state, leading to the presumption that arrestin binding is necessary for desensitization (2Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 17Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). In fact, it has become largely accepted that phosphorylation of a GPCR alone is insufficient to block G protein binding. However, evidence in support of this premise is lacking because the effect of phosphorylation on G protein binding to nonvisual GPCRs has not been investigated thoroughly. To explore the effect of FPR phosphorylation on signaling and processing assemblies, we have examined the wild type receptor as well as several phosphorylation-deficient mutants, using both cellular and noncellular approaches. We have examined the ability of these mutants, isolated from both stimulated and nonstimulated cells (i.e.phosphorylated and unphosphorylated states of the FPR), to interact with G protein and arrestin. In vitro spectrofluorometric analysis of solubilized mutant FPR proteins demonstrated that unphosphorylated receptors interacted with G proteins to the same extent as the wild type receptor. Using fluorescence microscopy, we have previously demonstrated that the WT FPR colocalizes with arrestin in response to treatment with agonist (18Bennett T.A. Maestas D.C. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24590-24594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Subsequently, utilizing a spectrofluorometric method similar to that used for determining G protein coupling, we have shown that the solubilized phosphorylated FPR specifically binds arrestin-2 and arrestin-3. This study is the first to simultaneously examine the binding of G proteins and arrestins to nonvisual GPCRs with intermediate levels of phosphorylation. Contrary to accepted dogma, our results demonstrate a novel finding suggesting that partial GPCR phosphorylation alone can be sufficient to block G protein binding, thereby desensitizing cellular responses prior to arrestin binding. The generation of FPR mutants and of U937 cells transfected with the FPR have been previously described (19Prossnitz E.R. Quehenberger O. Cochrane C.G. Ye R.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Plasticware was obtained from VWR Scientific Company. Chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma except where otherwise noted. The cells were grown in tissue culture-treated flasks (Corning) in RPMI 1640 (Hyclone) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, with 10 units/ml penicillin and 10 μg/ml streptomycin. The cultures were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and passaged from subconfluent cultures every 3–4 days by reseeding at 2 × 105 cells/ml. To expand cells for membrane preparations, 1-liter baffled spinner flasks (Pyrex) were seeded, equilibrated to 5% CO2, then sealed, and incubated at 37 °C. The cells were harvested when densities reached 1 × 109cells/liter. Functional bovine brain G protein was purchased from Calbiochem. Arrestin-2 was expressed in Escherichia coli (strain BL21) and purified by sequential heparin-Sepharose and Q-Sepharose chromatography essentially as described (20Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 422-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-arrestin-2 and anti-arrestin-3 rabbit polyclonal antisera were generously supplied by Dr. Jeffrey Benovic (Thomas Jefferson University). Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was from Vector Laboratories. The cells were harvested, and the preparations to be stimulated were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, equilibrated to 37 °C, and then incubated in the presence of 10 μm formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (Sigma) for 8 min. Stimulation at this ligand concentration for this duration results in ∼90% maximal receptor phosphorylation (21Hsu M.H. Chiang S.C. Ye R.D. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29426-29429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Following stimulation, an equal volume of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline was added, and tubes were immediately placed on ice. For membrane preparation, all harvested cells were centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min and resuspended in cavitation buffer (10 nm PIPES, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 3.5 mmMgCl2, 600 μg/ml ATP) at a density of 107cells/ml at 4 °C. The cell suspension was placed in a nitrogen bomb and pressurized to 450 p.s.i. using N2 gas for 20 min at 4 °C. Nuclei and cytoplasmic material were separated by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing the membranes was washed twice by centrifugation at 135,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, then resuspended in HEPES sucrose buffer (200 mm sucrose, 25 mmHEPES, pH 7), aliquoted, and stored until use at −80 °C. Membranes were thawed and diluted to 1–2 × 108 membrane cell equivalents/ml in binding buffer (30 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm MgCl2). Preparations were maintained at 4 °C throughout the extraction process. The membranes were centrifuged at 135,000 × g for 30 min and resuspended in 150 μl of binding buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture I and 1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (Calbiochem). The preparations were incubated for 60 min at 4 °C with agitation. The insoluble fraction was separated by centrifugation at 70,000 × g for 5 min in a Beckman Airfuge. The supernatant containing the solubilized fraction was removed, and this extract was used for experimentation within 6 h. Solubilized FPR (in 1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside prepared as above) was incubated with 1 μm bovine brain G protein or with 6 μmarrestin-2 for 2 h on ice in the presence of 10 nmformyl-Met-Leu-Phe-Lys-FITC (Sigma). Blocked samples were incubated with 1 μm formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-Phe (CBI) for 15 min prior to the addition of fMLFK-FITC. The samples were prepared in small volumes (typically 15 μl) to maximize receptor concentration. The control samples were prepared in the presence of appropriate buffer(s). The G protein buffer contained 50 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Lubrol (pH 7.6). The arrestin buffer contained 10 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μmleupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μm chymostatin (pH 7.5). The reconstitution incubations were carried out in the presence of 0.6–0.7% detergent (final concentration). Fluorescence associated with fMLFK-FITC was measured by a SLM 8000 spectrofluorometer (SLM Instruments, Inc.) using the photon counting mode in acquisition. The sample holder was fitted with a cylindrical cuvette adapter to permit measurements in stirred volumes of 200 μl using small cylindrical cuvettes (Sienco) and 2 × 5-mm stir bars (Bel-Art). Excitation was fixed at 490 nm, and stray light was reduced with a 490-nm, 10-nm band pass filter (Corion). FITC fluorescence emission was monitored using a 520-nm, 10-nm band pass interference filter (Corion) and a 3–70 orange glass, 500-nm long pass filter (Kopp). Additions to the samples during kinetic measurements were performed using 10-μl glass syringes (Hamilton) adding reagents through an injection port on the SLM 8000 above the sample cuvette. Following preparation at 4 °C, the samples were brought up to a volume of 200 μl with binding buffer plus 0.1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (to maintain a detergent concentration slightly above the critical micelle concentration), equilibrated to 22 °C, and placed into the spectrofluorometer with constant stirring. The data were acquired for 100 s in 1-s intervals. Typically, total fluorescence was obtained for the first 10 s, and then an anti-fluorescein antibody was added to the sample. The antibody binds free fMLFK-FITC with high affinity and results in essentially complete quenching of the fluorescence associated with free ligand (22Sklar L.A. Finney D.A. Oades Z.G. Jesaitis A.J. Painter R.G. Cochrane C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5661-5669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the remaining fluorescence represents the receptor-bound ligand. In G protein experiments, GTPγS (100 μm) sensitivity was used to assess the coupling between receptors and G proteins based on characteristic ligand dissociation rates. Membrane preparations were solubilized in detergent as outlined above. The sample was then incubated with 10 μl of anti-Gαi-1,2,3 antibody (Calbiochem) or 10 μl of a polyclonal mixture of anti-arrestin-2 and -3 or both for 45 min on ice with gentle agitation. To remove antibody-substrate conjugates, 100 μg of prehydrated protein A-agarose was added to the sample. After a 30-min incubation, the sample was centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 30 s, and the supernatant was removed. The protein A-agarose step was then repeated. WT and mutant receptor expressing cells were incubated with 10 nm FMLFK-FITC for 8 min at either 37 or 0 °C. Each of the samples was then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and permeabilized with 0.02% saponin. Arrestin-2 was detected by incubating cells with anti-arrestin antibody followed by a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to Texas Red. After three washes, the cells were resuspended in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and placed on a slide. Fluorescence images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope to localize both the FPR (green) and arrestin-2 (red) in FPR transfected U937 cells. Several FPR phosphorylation-deficient mutants have been previously generated, replacing potential phosphorylation sites (serine or threonine residues) with either alanine or glycine residues (14Maestes D.C. Potter R.M. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29791-29795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Four of these mutant receptors were used in the work presented here. Mutant ΔA (S328A,T329A,T331A,S332G) and mutant ΔB (T334G,T336G,S338G,T339A) represent mutations of two clusters of Ser and Thr residues (the A site and the B site, respectively) that each follow acidic residues. Mutants ΔC (S328A,T329A) and ΔD (T331A,S332G) each add back two potential phosphorylation sites altered in mutant ΔA (Fig. 1). Previous characterization demonstrated that these four mutants induced Ca2+ mobilization and internalized to the same extent as the wild type receptor (14Maestes D.C. Potter R.M. Prossnitz E.R. J.

However, they differ in their levels of phosphorylation and their ability to desensitize (TableI and Ref. 14Maestes D.C. Potter R.M. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol.

These assays incorporate spectrofluorometric analysis that follows ligand dissociation from receptor complexes in real time, allowing us to determine the state of the FPR and determine the affinity of protein-protein interactions. To assess the effect of receptor phosphorylation with respect to G protein coupling, we first characterized the ability of the mutant receptors to bind purified G protein in their unstimulated (putatively unphosphorylated) state. We will refer to the receptor preparations from unstimulated cells as unphosphorylated and those from the stimulated cells as phosphorylated. Two distinct rates of ligand dissociation can be observed dependent on whether a G protein is bound to the receptor (25Fay S.P. Posner R.G. Swann W.N. Sklar L.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5066-5075Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 26Posner R.G. Fay S.P. Domalewski M.D. Sklar L.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 65-73PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sklar L.A. Mueller H. Omann G. Oades Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8483-8486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The receptor-G protein complex has a higher affinity for ligand than receptor alone. Additionally, the high ligand affinity state of the receptor (G protein-coupled) is sensitive to guanine nucleotide (GTPγS), which uncouples the G protein from the receptor. Therefore, the addition of GTPγS results in a rapid change in the observed dissociation rate. Solubilized receptor preparations were incubated with 1 μm bovine brain G protein and 10 nmfMLFK-FITC for 90 min. As seen in Fig. 2(a and b), the phosphorylation-deficient mutant receptors interacted with exogenously added G proteins to the same extent as the wild type receptor. The mutant receptors were also able to form the high affinity complex by reconstituting with endogenous G proteins. An example is shown in Fig. 2c with the ΔB receptor. The ratio of receptors in the high ligand affinity state to those in the low ligand affinity state increased with increased G protein concentration. Thus, the high level of receptor-G protein coupling that was observed in Fig. 2 (a and b) was the result of the combination of endogenous G proteins and the exogenously added bovine brain G protein. Removal of the endogenous G proteins by immunodepletion results in all of the receptors displaying the low ligand affinity state characteristic of the uncoupled WT FPR (Fig. 2d). It has been reported that for rhodopsin and the β2adrenergic receptors, phosphorylation decreases the affinity of the receptor for G protein but is not sufficient to fully desensitize the receptor (15Wilden U. Hall S.W. Kuhn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 28Benovic J.L. Kuhn H. Weyand I. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8879-8882Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of phosphorylation on the FPR-G protein interaction, we produced membrane preparations from cells that had been treated with agonist prior to cavitation. As we have previously demonstrated, this agonist stimulation results in phosphorylation of the FPR (21Hsu M.H. Chiang S.C. Ye R.D. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29426-29429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These receptor preparations were immunodepleted of endogenous arrestins, because arrestins also bind to phosphorylated receptors and would compete with G protein coupling. The samples were incubated with up to 3 μm bovine brain G protein and 10 nm fMLFK-FITC for 90 min. The phosphorylated WT receptor was unable to couple to G protein (Fig.3a). In contrast, both the ΔA and ΔB receptors displayed the high affinity receptor state indicative of G protein coupling, and the ligand dissociation rate was sensitive to guanine nucleotide (Fig. 3, b andc). The phosphorylated ΔC and ΔD receptors, however, were indistinguishable from wild type. Incubation of ΔC and ΔD receptors with G protein did not alter the ligand dissociation rate compared with samples incubated with a control buffer (Fig. 3,d and e). The effect of the decreased levels of phosphorylation in the mutant receptors altered only one of the cellular processes previously examined: the ability of the ΔA and ΔB receptors to become desensitized (14Maestes D.C. Potter R.M. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29791-29795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Using confocal microscopy imaging, we have demonstrated that arrestin colocalizes with the active WT FPR in vivo (18Bennett T.A. Maestas D.C. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24590-24594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Additionally, purified arrestin was able to bind to the solubilized, phosphorylated WT receptor in our fluorometric assays (42Key T.A. Bennett T.A. Gurevich V.V. Sklar L.A. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49204-49212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We incorporated both of these approaches to further evaluate the role of phosphorylation in receptor desensitization. First, we examined the ability of arrestin to colocalize with the phosphorylation-deficient mutants using confocal fluorescent microscopy techniques. Cells expressing either WT or mutant receptors were stimulated with a fluorescent agonist to identify and track the FPR as it was processed. Arrestin-2 was detected with an anti-arrestin antibody followed by a secondary antibody conjugated to Texas Red. Both the FPR and arrestin-2 initially appear in a diffuse pattern in the control sample, where cells were treated with the fluorescent agonist but kept at 0 °C (Fig.4). The FPR was concentrated mainly at the cell surface, whereas the arrestin was distributed throughout the cytoplasm. The 0 point control for each of the mutant receptors was identical to the wild type FPR (data not shown). Following an 8-min incubation with the fluorescent agonist at 37 °C, the wild type FPR was localized to punctate clusters. Arrestin also translocated to clusters that colocalized with the FPR. All of the phosphorylation-deficient mutant receptors displayed a similar ability to form similar clusters of the FPR after stimulation with agonist. However, the arrestin distribution varied between these cells. In the ΔA and ΔB cells, each lacking four potential phosphorylation sites, the arrestin did not redistribute but remained dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. The ΔB cells displayed a low level of arrestin colocalization with the receptor, but only at a few of the densest receptor clusters could this be observed (data not shown). The ΔC and ΔD expressing cells, with only two potential phosphorylation sites missing, displayed the same FPR-arrestin colocalization as the wild type receptors. To quantitatively assess the ability of the mutant receptors to interact with arrestin, we utilized the in vitroreconstitution assays using solubilized receptor preparations and purified arrestin-2. Arrestin binding to a phosphorylated receptor induces a high ligand affinity state similar to G protein coupling (29Gurevich V.V. Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. Onorato J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28849-28852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The difference between the two high ligand affinity states is discerned by sensitivity to guanine nucleotide. The slow ligand dissociation from the receptor-arrestin complex is not altered by the addition of GTPγS as it is for receptor-G protein complexes. We have previously demonstrated that solubilized WT receptor preparations from cells that were not stimulated with agonist display no ability to bind arrestin (42Key T.A. Bennett T.A. Gurevich V.V. Sklar L.A. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49204-49212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This also proved true for each of the mutant receptors. Nonstimulated receptors depleted of G protein and then incubated with up to 40 μm arrestin-2 did not display the high ligand affini"

In polarized epithelial cells, cell-cell junctions form a specialized membrane structure, comprising TJs,1 AJs, and desmosomes, which is known as the junctional complex. These three junctional structures are aligned from the apical side to the basal side of the lateral membrane, although desmosomes are independently distributed in other areas. TJs function as a barrier preventing solutes and water from passing freely through the paracellular pathway (for reviews, see Refs. 3Tsukita S. Furuse M. Itoh M. Curr. Opin.

Dlg1, aDrosophila counterpart of hDlg, plays a critical role in the formation of cell-cell junctions of epithelial cells and the polarity of neuroepithelial cells in the embryo ofDrosophila (49Bilder D. Li M. Perrimon N. Science. 2000; 289: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 50Ohshiro T. Yagami T. Zhang C. Matsuzaki F.

Although the function of hDlg in mammalian epithelial cells is not clear, it could be a core protein in the formation of cell-cell junctions. However, little is known about hDlg-binding molecules or the mechanism of the localization of this molecule at AJs. In this study, we attempted to identify an hDlg-binding protein using the yeast two-hybrid screening and identified a novel protein from a human cDNA library. However, this protein was a component of TJs rather than AJs. We also found that the protein was incorporated into TJs after TJ strands were formed, and therefore named it Pilt (protein incorporated later intoTJs). We describe here the identification and characterization of Pilt. A bait vector, pBTM116HA hDlg-2–2, was constructed by subcloning the insert encoding aa 581–926 of hDlg-2 into pBTM116HA (52Fujiwara T. Tanaka K. Mino A. Kikyo M. Takahashi K. Shimizu K. Takai Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1221-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). A mouse 11-day embryo yeast two-hybrid library was purchased from CLONTECH and screened as described previously (47Takeuchi M. Hata Y. Hirao K. Toyoda A. Irie M. Takai Y. J. Biol.

Various constructs of Pilt and hDlg-2 contained the following aa: pClneo Myc Pilt, aa 1–547 (full-length); pMXII-EGFPC Pilt, aa 1–547 (full-length); pGex4T-1 Pilt-2, aa 1–260; and pGex4T-1 hDlg-2–4, aa 560–926 (SH3 and GK domains). A rabbit polyclonal Ab was raised against GST-Pilt-2. A mouse monoclonal anti-human JAM Ab (55Ozaki H. Ishii K. Horiuchi H. Arai H. Kawamoto T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kita T. J.

A rat monoclonal anti-nectin-2 Ab was prepared as described (35Takahashi K. Nakanishi H. Miyahara M. Mandai M. Satoh K. Satoh A. Nishioka H. Aoki J. Nomoto A. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J.

Rabbit polyclonal anti-claudin-1, mouse monoclonal anti-Myc, and mouse monoclonal anti-PSD-95 family Abs were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc., American Type Culture Collection, and Upstate Biotechnology, respectively. COS7, MTD-1A, and L cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal calf serum. COS7 cells were transfected with the DEAE dextran method (57Hata Y. Südhof T.C. J. Biol.

COS7 cells on two 10-cm dishes were transfected with pClneo Myc Pilt. The cells were then sonicated in 0.2 ml of Buffer A (20 mm Tris/Cl at pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm α-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) containing 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, followed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was incubated with GST or GST-hDlg-2–4 (2 nmol each) immobilized on 50 μl (wet volume) of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). After the beads were extensively washed with Buffer A containing 0.3% (w/v) Triton X-100. the bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in an SDS sample buffer (60 mm Tris/Cl at pH 6.7, 3% SDS, 2% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol). The sample was then subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide gel), followed by Western blotting with the anti-Myc Ab or protein staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Wound healing assay was performed as described (58Asakura T. Nakanishi H. Sakisaka T. Takahashi K. Mandai K. Nishimura M. Sasaki T. Takai Y.

Briefly, about 60% confluent MTD1-A cells stably expressing EGFP-Pilt on 35-mm dishes were detached with 0.25% trypsin and 1 mm EDTA, and 5 × 105cells were seeded on 35-mm grid tissue culture dishes. After the cells were incubated for about 48 h in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal calf serum to be confluent, the cells were scratched manually with the needle of a 10-μl syringe (Hamilton Co.) and further cultured for 3, 6, or 8 h.

Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was done as described (63Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar). Prestained markers used in Western blotting were β-galactosidase (123 kDa), phosphorylase B (106 kDa), and BSA (77 kDa). Standard markers used in protein staining were phosphorylase B (97 kDa), BSA (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), and carbonic anhydrase (31 kDa). To identify an hDlg-binding protein, we performed the yeast two-hybrid screening using the region of hDlg-2 containing the SH3 and GK domains (aa 581–926) as a bait. We obtained 31 positive clones from 1 × 106 clones of a mouse 11-day embryo yeast two-hybrid library. Twenty-three clones were overlapped and encoded an identical protein. These mouse cDNA clones had homology to the C-terminal portion of a human cDNA (NT2RP3003185; GenBank™/EMBL/DDBL accession no. AK024269) (74% identity of aa sequence). The full-length clone of this human cDNA encoded a protein composed of 547 aa and a calculated M r of 60,704 (Fig.1 A). We named this protein Pilt (protein incorporated later into TJs), because it was incorporated into TJs later after the claudin-based junctional strands were formed as described below. The aa sequences of the N- and C-terminal regions of Pilt were 43 and 51% identical to those of BEGAIN (48Deguchi M. Hata Y. Takeuchi M. Ide N. Hirao K. Yao I. Irie M. Toyoda A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26269-26272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), respectively, but other regions showed no homology to BEGAIN (Fig. 1 B). BEGAIN has been identified as a protein interacting with the GK domain of PSD-95/SAP90 (48Deguchi M. Hata Y. Takeuchi M. Ide N. Hirao K. Yao I. Irie M. Toyoda A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26269-26272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Like BEGAIN, the software COILS version 2 predicted a coiled-coil structure in the N-terminal region of Pilt. Pilt has a proline-rich domain, whereas BEGAIN does not. BEGAIN has one nuclear localization signal, whereas Pilt does not. Pilt has no transmembrane segment. To confirm whether the isolated cDNA encodes the full-length of Pilt, COS7 cells were transfected with pClneo Myc Pilt. The extract was subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with the anti-Pilt Ab. A protein with a molecular mass of ∼85 kDa was detected (Fig.1 C). When the extract of MTD-1A cells was subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with the anti-Pilt Ab, a protein with almost the same molecular mass as that of Myc-tagged Pilt was detected. Therefore, we concluded that the isolated cDNA encodes the full length of Pilt. To confirm the interaction of Pilt with hDlg, the extract of COS7 cells expressing Myc-tagged Pilt was incubated with a GST fusion protein of hDlg (SH3 and GK domains) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. After washing the beads, the bound proteins were eluted and the half of the eluate was subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with the anti-Myc Ab. The other half was subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by protein staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Myc-tagged Pilt indeed bound hDlg (Fig.2, A and B). Northern blot analysis using the full-length cDNA of Pilt as a probe detected ∼3.0-kb mRNA in all the human tissues examined, including heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas, spleen, thymus, prostate, testis, ovary, small intestine, colon, and leukocytes (Fig. 3 A). Subcellular fractionation analysis of Pilt in rat liver indicated that it was enriched in the fraction rich in AJs and TJs, where hDlg was also enriched (Fig. 3 B). Because hDlg has been shown to localize at AJs (40Muller B.M. Kistner U. Veh R.W. Cases-Langhoff C. Becker B. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2354-2366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined by immunofluorescence microscopy whether Pilt colocalized with hDlg at AJs in MTD-1A cells. MTD-1A cells are mouse mammary tumor cells (64Takeuchi K. Sato N. Kasahara H. Funayama N. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Pilt and hDlg localized at cell-cell junctions, but the distribution pattern of Pilt was slightly different from that of hDlg (Fig.4 A). We therefore next examined whether Pilt colocalized with ZO-1 at TJs in MTD-1A cells. The two proteins colocalized at the cell-cell junctions (Fig.4 B). To further confirm the colocalization of Pilt and ZO-1 in MTD-1A cells, EGFP-tagged full-length Pilt was stably expressed in MTD-1A cells and the localization of the expressed protein was compared with that of endogenous ZO-1. Exogenously expressed Pilt colocalized with ZO-1 (Fig. 4 C). Because ZO-1 localizes at TJs in epithelial cells (5Stevenson B.R. Siliciano J.D. Mooseker M.S. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar, 7Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Kitani-Yasuda T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), these results suggest that Pilt localizes at TJs. It may be noted that Pilt was also stained at the perinuclear regions, most presumably the Golgi complex as estimated by the co-staining with Golgi 58-kDa protein (p58), a marker for the Golgi complex (65Bloom G.S. Brashear T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16083-16092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 D). To obtain the definitive evidence for the localization of Pilt at TJs, its localization was analyzed in small intestine absorptive epithelial cells, because TJs and AJs are well separated in this cell type (7Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Kitani-Yasuda T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that Pilt colocalized with ZO-1 at TJs in small intestine absorptive epithelial cells (Fig.5 A). It was also stained at the perinuclear regions, presumably the Golgi complex. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that Pilt exclusively localized at TJs and were absent from AJs and desmosomes (Fig. 5 B). We examined whether Pilt directly interacts with claudin or JAM. For this purpose, we took advantage of cadherin-deficient L cells stably expressing claudin-1 or JAM (claudin-L and JAM-L cells, respectively) (27Itoh M. Sasaki H. Furuse M. Ozaki H. Kita T. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 66Furuse M Sasaki H Fujimoto K Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). In claudin-L cells, claudin-1 and ZO-1 were concentrated at cell-cell contact sites, but Pilt was not concentrated there (Fig.6 A). Pilt was stained at the perinuclear regions. In JAM-L cells, JAM was concentrated at cell-cell contact sites, but Pilt was not concentrated there (Fig.6 B). Pilt was again stained at the perinuclear regions. It has been shown that ZO-1 colocalizes with JAM (27Itoh M. Sasaki H. Furuse M. Ozaki H. Kita T. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Although we have not examined the in vitro binding of Pilt with claudin, JAM, or ZO-1, the results suggest that Pilt does not directly interact with these proteins. When confluent cultures of MTD-1A cells are scratched with a needle, very thin cellular protrusions begin to emerge from the front edge of the wound at the initial stage of wound healing process. At the next stage, small cell-cell junctions are formed at the tips of these cellular protrusions, which are regarded as spot-like primordial junctions as reported previously (59Yonemura S. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 127-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 60Ando-Akatsuka Y. Yonemura S. Itoh M. Furuse M. Tsukita S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Nectin-2 is concentrated at these small contact sites (58Asakura T. Nakanishi H. Sakisaka T. Takahashi K. Mandai K. Nishimura M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 573-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We confirmed this earlier observation (Fig.7 A). Pilt was not accumulated at the spot-like junctions, although it was stained at cell-cell junctions at the non-wounding regions. At the next stage of this wound healing process, the spot-like junctions begin to be fused to form short line-like junctions (58Asakura T. Nakanishi H. Sakisaka T. Takahashi K. Mandai K. Nishimura M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 573-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 59Yonemura S. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 127-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 60Ando-Akatsuka Y. Yonemura S. Itoh M. Furuse M. Tsukita S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Claudin was accumulated at this type of junction (Fig. 7 B). Pilt was not concentrated at the line-like junctions. At the later stage of this process, the line-like junctions grow up to complete cell-cell junctions. Pilt was finally stained at these junctions (Fig. 7 C). These results indicate that Pilt is incorporated into TJs at the very late stage. We have isolated here a novel protein, named Pilt, as an hDlg-binding protein. However, the immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopic analyses indicate that Pilt localizes at TJs but not at AJs in epithelial cells including cultured MTD-1A cells and small intestine absorptive epithelial cells, whereas hDlg localizes at AJs. Furthermore, Pilt is incorporated into TJs at the very late stage of wound healing process, whereas hDlg is incorporated into spot-like junctions at the initial stage. 2A. Fukuhara, K. Irie, and Y. Takai, unpublished observation. These results suggest that Pilt is not a physiological binding partner of hDlg in epithelial cells, although we do not exclude the possibility that Pilt directly interacts with hDlg in cells lacking TJs. The Northern blot analysis indicates that Pilt is highly expressed in tissues, such as skeletal muscle and spleen, which are not rich in TJs. Conversely, the expression of Pilt is relatively low in tissues that are rich in TJs. It remains to be clarified why Pilt shows such tissue distribution patterns. It remains unknown, as well, whether Pilt colocalizes with hDlg in cells lacking TJs. Further studies are necessary to conclude whether Pilt is the physiological binding partner of hDlg. Because Pilt has no transmembrane segment and localizes at TJs, it could bind to the peripheral membrane proteins at TJs. Pilt is not recruited to claudin-based or JAM-based contact sites in L cells, suggesting that Pilt does not directly interact with claudin, JAM, or ZO-1. The exact reason for the failure of Pilt to be recruited to these cell-cell contact sites is not known, but may be simply because many other components of TJs found in epithelial cells, such as ZO-2 (9Jesaitis L.A. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), ZO-3 (12Haskins J. Gu L. Wittchen E.S. Hibabrd J. Stevenson B.R. J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1003-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), may be absent in non-epithelial cells, such as L cells. Although we have not examined here a possible interaction of Pilt with all the known peripheral membrane proteins at TJs, immunoprecipitation analysis with the anti-FLAG Ab from the soluble fraction of MDCK cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged Pilt has not yet revealed any Pilt-binding protein (data not shown). Identification of Pilt-binding proteins is necessary for our understanding of the physiological function of Pilt and of the mechanism of the localization of Pilt at TJs. During the formation of epithelial cell-cell junctions, primordial spot-like junctions are first formed at the tips of the cellular protrusions radiating from adjacent cells (58Asakura T.

Cadherin, nectin, JAM, afadin, and ZO-1 colocalize at the spot-like junctions where claudin and occludin are not concentrated (58Asakura T. Nakanishi H. Sakisaka T. Takahashi K. Mandai K. Nishimura M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 573-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar,60Ando-Akatsuka Y. Yonemura S. Itoh M. Furuse M. Tsukita S. J. Cell.

As cellular polarization proceeds, claudin and occludin gradually accumulate at the spot-like junctions to form TJs, and cadherin, nectin, and afadin are sorted out from claudin, occludin, JAM, and ZO-1 to form AJs. We have shown here that Pilt is incorporated into TJs at the very late stage. It remains to be clarified how Pilt is recruited to TJs at the very late stage, but this recruitment may be closely correlated with the function of Pilt. Several molecules involved in vesicle trafficking, such as Rab3B and mammalian homologues of yeast SEC6 and -8 gene products, are concentrated at the cytoplasmic face of TJs (32Weber E. Berta G.

https://openalex.org/W1559906182,"4-Hydroxybenzoyl-CoA reductase (4-HBCR) is a key enzyme in the anaerobic metabolism of phenolic compounds. It catalyzes the reductive removal of the hydroxyl group from the aromatic ring yielding benzoyl-CoA and water. The subunit architecture, amino acid sequence, and the cofactor/metal content indicate that it belongs to the xanthine oxidase (XO) family of molybdenum cofactor-containing enzymes. 4-HBCR is an unusual XO family member as it catalyzes the irreversible reduction of a CoA-thioester substrate. A radical mechanism has been proposed for the enzymatic removal of phenolic hydroxyl groups. In this work we studied the spectroscopic and electrochemical properties of 4-HBCR by EPR and Mössbauer spectroscopy and identified the pterin cofactor as molybdopterin mononucleotide. In addition to two different [2Fe-2S] clusters, one FAD and one molybdenum species per monomer, we also identified a [4Fe-4S] cluster/monomer, which is unique among members of the XO family. The reduced [4Fe-4S] cluster interacted magnetically with the Mo(V) species, suggesting that the centers are in close proximity, (<15 Å apart). Additionally, reduction of the [4Fe-4S] cluster resulted in a loss of the EPR signals of the [2Fe-2S] clusters probably because of magnetic interactions between the Fe-S clusters as evidenced in power saturation studies. The Mo(V) EPR signals of 4-HBCR were typical for XO family members. Under steady-state conditions of substrate reduction, in the presence of excess dithionite, the [4Fe-4S] clusters were in the fully oxidized state while the [2Fe-2S] clusters remained reduced. The redox potentials of the redox cofactors were determined to be: [2Fe-2S]+1/+2 I, −205 mV; [2Fe-2S]+1/+2 II, −255 mV; FAD/FADH⋅/FADH, −250 mV/−470 mV; [4Fe-4S]+1/+2, −465 mV and Mo(VI)/(V)/(VI), −380 mV/−500 mV.

Methoxyl groups are usually converted to hydroxyl groups and C1 units before further metabolism takes place. In recent years a growing number of anaerobic bacteria have been identified that use low molecular mass aromatic compounds as their sole sources of cell carbon and energy. In the presence of molecular oxygen, hydroxylation is catalyzed by mono- or dioxygenases, and oxidative aromatic ring cleavage is catalyzed by dioxygenases. However, in the absence of the highly reactive co-substrate oxygen, alternative strategies have developed in anaerobic bacteria (1Heider J. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 577-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 2Harwood C.S. Burchhardt G. Hermann H. Fuchs G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 22: 439-458Crossref Google Scholar). Many compounds are converted to the central intermediate benzoyl-CoA, which becomes dearomatized by benzoyl-CoA reductase (BCR)1 (1Heider J. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 577-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). This enzyme couples the difficult ring reduction to a stoichiometric ATP hydrolysis (3Boll M. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). It is assumed that BCR also catalyzes the direct ring reduction of ortho- or meta-substituted hydroxy-, amino- or methyl-derivatives of benzoyl-CoA. 2H. Möbitz and M. Boll, submitted for publication. 2H. Möbitz and M. Boll, submitted for publication. Examples are 3-hydroxy- or 3-methyl-benzoyl-CoA (5Laempe D. Jahn M. Breese K. Schägger H. Fuchs G. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 968-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, the aromatic ring of para-substituted derivatives, for example 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA (4-HBCoA) cannot be reduced by BCR or similar enzymes for mechanistic reasons.2 Therefore, an additional group of enzymes should exist that reductively removes hydroxy or amino groups from the ring prior to dearomatization. The only enzyme of this group of which the biochemistry has been studied so far is 4-HBCR from the denitrifying bacterium Thauera aromatica (6Brackmann R. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This enzyme plays a key role in the anaerobic metabolism of phenolic compounds (1Heider J. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 577-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar).4-HBCR catalyzes the reductive dehydroxylation of 4-HBCoA to benzoyl-CoA as two electrons are transferred to the substrate (6Brackmann R. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). The natural electron donor is a reduced 2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxin (7Breese K. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 916-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), which also serves as the in vivo electron donor for the next enzyme in aromatic metabolism, benzoyl-CoA reductase (8Boll M. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 946-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). 4-HBCR has a molecular mass of 260 kDa and consists of three subunits of 75 (α), 35 (β), and 17 kDa (γ), suggesting an (αβγ)2 composition (6Brackmann R. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Purified 4-HBCR contained 15 mol of iron, 12.5 acid-labile sulfur, 1.3 mol of FAD and 1.9 mol of molybdenum per mol of dimeric enzyme (7Breese K. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 916-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The enzyme was inactivated by cyanide giving initial evidence that it may belong to the xanthine oxidase (XO) family of molybdenum cofactor-containing enzymes (6Brackmann R. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).The genes coding for the three subunits of 4-HBCR have been cloned and sequenced in T. aromatica (7Breese K. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 916-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and in the phototrophic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris (9Gibson J. Dispensa M. Harwood C.S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 634-642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They are highly conserved between these two organisms and also show high similarity to several enzymes of the XO family. This was highest with carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (CODH) from Oligotropha carboxydovorans and Pseudomonas thermocarboxydovorans, with nicotine dehydrogenase from Arthrobacter nicotinovorans, and with eukaryotic xanthine dehydrogenases (XDH) (7Breese K. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 916-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).The XO family of molybdenum-cofactor-containing enzymes comprises a large group of enzymes that usually catalyze hydroxy- or oxo-transfer to the substrate. They usually contain a molybdopterin-cofactor and [2Fe-2S] clusters; many also harbor an FAD cofactor on a special subunit (10Hille R. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2757-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar, 11Kisker C. Schindelin H. Rees D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 233-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 12Kisker C. Schindelin H. Baas D. Rétey J. Meckenstock R.U. Kroneck P. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 22: 503-521Crossref Google Scholar). Although 4-HBCR has high similarity to the above members of the XO family (30–41% overall identity), some special features are unique: (i) The β-subunit harbors an additional domain consisting of ∼40 amino acids, with five cysteine residues, suggesting the presence of an additional [4Fe-4S] cluster (7Breese K. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 916-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar); this assumption agrees with the higher iron content (7.5 mol/mol monomer) and is inconsistent with the presence of only the usual two [2Fe-2S] clusters/monomer. (ii) 4-HBCR is the only member of this family whose function is to catalyze the reverse reaction, the reduction of the substrate; note that the 4-HBCR reaction is considered to be irreversible for mechanistic reasons (see below) (13Buckel W. Keese R. Angew. Chem. 1995; 107: 1595-1598Crossref Google Scholar). (iii) The CoA-ester substrate of 4-HBCR is exceptionally large suggesting the presence of an additional nucleotide binding site for the CoA-moiety.Although the reduction of 4-hydroxybenzoate to benzoate plus water by molecular hydrogen is highly exergonic (59 kJ/mol, calculated from the free energy of formation for the individual compounds from the elements (14Thauer R.K Jungermann K. Decker K. Bacteriol. Rev. 1977; 41: 100-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), the reductive removal of an hydroxy group at the aromatic ring is difficult to achieve mechanistically (13Buckel W. Keese R. Angew. Chem. 1995; 107: 1595-1598Crossref Google Scholar). In particular, 4-hydroxybenzoate undergoes activation to 4-HBCoA by specific ATP-dependent CoA ligases in R. palustris and T. aromatica (15Biegert T. Altenschmidt U. Eckerskorn C. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 16Gibson J. Dispensa M. Fogg G.C. Evans D.T. Harwood C.S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 634-641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which should facilitate the subsequent reductive elimination of water. Buckel and Keese have proposed that the CoA-thioester moiety plays an essential role in enzymatic dehydroxylation by stabilizing a ketyl radical intermediate (13Buckel W. Keese R. Angew. Chem. 1995; 107: 1595-1598Crossref Google Scholar). In chemical systems the removal of phenolic hydroxy groups usually proceeds in a Birch-like mechanism involving alternate one-electron and one-proton transfers to the aromatic ring (see also Fig. 11 A). Kinetic and electrochemical data on the enzyme indicate two successive one-electron transfer steps to the aromatic ring, supporting a Birch-like mechanism (17Kasmi A.E. Brackmann R. Fuchs G. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11668-11677Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In addition, it was predicted that a one-electron redox center with a midpoint potential of −357 mV catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the reductase reaction (17Kasmi A.E. Brackmann R. Fuchs G. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11668-11677Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, a radical mechanism has not yet been proposed for any other molybdenum-cofactor-containing enzyme.Figure 11Hypothetical mechanism of 4-HBCoA reduction and proposed catalytic cycle of 4-HBCR.

We provide spectroscopic evidence that 4-HBCR contains the expected [2Fe-2S] clusters, FAD and molybdenum, plus an additional [4Fe-4S] cluster that is unique among enzymes of the XO family. We suggest that the [4Fe-4S] cluster is involved in electron transfer from ferredoxin to the substrate and provide evidence that it is located close to the molybdenum-cofactor, which is molybdopterin mononucleotide. The Mo(V) EPR signals are typical of the XO family enzymes. Based on these results, a catalytic mechanism is proposed.RESULTSNature of the Iron-Sulfur ClustersThe metal analysis of 4-HBCR revealed the presence of 15–16 mol of iron/mol of dimeric enzyme (α2β2γ2) indicating that the iron content was double of that of typical members of the XO family that have 8 mol of iron/mol of dimeric enzyme. Amino acid sequence analysis suggested the presence of an additional [4Fe-4S] cluster in the β-subunit of 4-HBCR in addition to the two [2Fe-2S] clusters that are usually found in the small γ-subunit of XO-type enzymes. To elucidate the nature of the iron-sulfur clusters Mössbauer and EPR spectroscopic studies were performed.Mössbauer Spectroscopy of Thionine-oxidized 4-HBCRFor Mössbauer spectroscopy studies, BCR was purified from extracts of T. aromatica grown anaerobically with57Fe as the sole source of iron. High 57Fe enrichment was achieved (>90%) as estimated from the resonance absorption effect of each subspectrum of the oxidized sample. In Fig.2, the Mössbauer spectra of the thionine-oxidized 57Fe-labeled 4-HBCR taken at 4.2 K in external fields of 20 mT ⊥γ (A) and 7 T ∥γ (B) are shown. Spectrum A consists of two doublets with an area ratio of 1:1. One of the doublets exhibits parameters typical of delocalized mixed-valence high-spin iron sites (Fe2.5+) with tetrahedral sulfur-coordination (δ = 0.44 mm s−1; ΔEQ = 1.12 mm s−1; Γ = 0.33 mm s−1; dotted line in Fig.2 A) as in [4Fe-4S]2+ and in [3Fe-4S]0 clusters (26Mulliez E. Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Meier C. Cremonini M. Luchinat C. Trautwein A.X. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The second doublet is characteristic of high-spin Fe3+ sites tetrahedrally coordinated with sulfur ligands (δ = 0.29 mm s−1; AEQ = 0.61 mm s−1; Γ = 0.27 mm s−1; dashed line in Fig. 2 A). Such Fe3+ sites are present in [2Fe-2S]1+/2+ and [3Fe-4S]0 clusters (26Mulliez E. Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Meier C. Cremonini M. Luchinat C. Trautwein A.X. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Applying a high external field (Fig. 2 B) demonstrates the presence of two diamagnetic components with area ratio 1:1. This observation rules out the existence of paramagnetic [2Fe-2S]1+ and [3Fe-4S]0 clusters. Therefore, thionine-oxidized HBCR contains [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters and [2Fe-2S]2+ clusters in a ratio of 1:2. Together with the measured Fe content of 15–16 iron per protein molecule our results indicate that a dimer of 4-HBCR contains two [4Fe-4S] clusters and four [2Fe-2S] clusters. This result agrees completely with the predictions made by amino acid sequence analysis (7Breese K. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 916-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Figure 2Mössbauer spectra of57Fe enriched 4-OH-benzoyl-CoA reductase (650 μ m ) oxidized by thionine.

The central region of spectrum A (measured at 120 K) shows a strongly asymmetric doublet, the right part of which (in the interval 0.5–1.0 mm s−1) is not resolved as it is in Fig. 2 A. This behavior indicates the superposition of several subspectra. Since spectrum B, measured at 4.2 K in an applied magnetic field of 20 mT, contains diamagnetic as well as paramagnetic components, we have included subspectra characteristic of diamagnetic [4Fe-4S]2+ and [2Fe-2S]2+ clusters, as well as subspectra characteristic of paramagnetic [4Fe-4S]1+ and [2Fe-2S]1+clusters, in the simulations of the spectra of dithionite-reduced 4-HBCR (Fig. 3). The subspectra of [4Fe-4S]2+ and of [2Fe-2S]2+ at 4.2 K correspond to those shown in Fig. 2; however, at 120 K the parameters had to be slightly readjusted,i.e. δ = 0.44 mm s−1, ΔEQ= 0.88 mm s−1, Γ = 0.33 mm s−1 for [4Fe-4S]2+, and δ = 0.29 mm s−1, ΔEQ = 0.83 mm s−1, Γ = 0.36 mm s−1 for [2Fe-2S]2+. At 120 K (Fig.3 A) subspectrum 2 also represents the Fe3+ sites of [2Fe-2S]1+ clusters, while subspectrum 4 represents the Fe2+ sites of these clusters with the parameters δ = 0.60 mm s−1, ΔEQ = 3.10 mm s−1, Γ = 0.38 mm s−1. The remaining [4Fe-4S]1+ clusters at 120 K are represented in Fig. 3 A (subspectra 5, 6) by the parameters δ = 0.54 mm s−1; ΔEQ = 1.04 mm s−1, Γ = 0.40 mm s−1, which are characteristic of these clusters at elevated temperature (27Thomson C.L. Johnson C.E. Dickson D.P.E. Cammack R. Hall D.O. Weser U. Rao K.K. Biochem. J. 1974; 139: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). At 4.2 K (Fig. 3, B and C) the [4Fe-4S]1+ clusters need to be simulated with the spin-Hamiltonian parameters of two different components, representing two antiferromagnetically coupled 2Fe subclusters with spins 9/2 and 4 respectively, yielding an overall cluster spin of 1/2 (28Middleton P. Dickson P.D.E. Johnson C.E. Rush J.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 88: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Correspondingly at 4.2 K the [2Fe-2S]+ clusters were simulated with the spin-Hamiltonian parameters of the antiferromagnetically coupled Fe3+ (S = 5/2) and Fe2+ (S = 2) subsites (29Loyd S.G. Franco R. Moura J.J.G. Moura I. Ferreira G. Huynh B.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 9892-9900Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar), represented by subspectra 3 and 4. The relevant parameters of all subspectra, which were used to simulate the measured spectra of dithionite-reduced 4-HBCR at 4.2 K (Fig. 3, B and C), are summarized in Table l. The simulations reveal the following cluster stoichiometry: [4Fe-4S]2+:[4Fe-4S]1+:[2Fe-2S]2+:[2Fe-2S]1+equal to 1:1:1:3. Thus, 50% of the [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters and 75% of the [2Fe-2S]2+ clusters have been reduced by dithionite. This result already suggests that the redox potential of the [4Fe-4S]+1/+2 cluster is substantially more negative than that of the [2Fe-2S]+1/+2 clusters (see also below).Figure 3Mössbauer spectra of 57Fe enriched 4-HBCR (650 μm) reduced by dithionite.

To follow the successive reduction of the individual redox active centers, samples of 4-HBCR were taken at potentials between −100 mV and −570 mV at ∼30 mV steps. In these studies, we attempted to assign EPR signals to individual clusters and to elucidate their redox properties.At potentials below −190 mV EPR signals appeared between 330 and 350 mT, which were almost fully developed at −350 mV. EPR signals of at least two different paramagnetic species were observed with characteristic features at gz1 = 2.04 and gz2 = 2.02 (using the convention gx < gy < gz). Representative EPR spectra recorded at −190 mV and −284 mV are presented in Fig. 4, A and C. The −190 mV spectrum was greatly obscured by the radical EPR signal of the redox dyes. After subtraction of this signal, a rhombic S = ½ EPR signal with g values at 2.04, 1.995, and 1.964 (gav = 1.999) was obtained which we assign to an Fe-S cluster (Fig. 4 B). This spectrum also included additional minor sharp features between g = 1.96 and 1.98, which can probably be assigned to a resting Mo(V) signal (for a detailed characterization of the Mo(V) EPR signals, see below). The difference spectrum between the EPR spectra recorded at −284 mV and −190 mV (after normalized subtraction of the redox dye radical signal) is presented in Fig. 4 D. It displays a slightly rhombic EPR signal, which we assign to a second Fe-S cluster with typical g values at 2.02, 1.977, and 1.961 (gav = 1.986). The redox potential-dependent rise of both signals is shown in Fig.5 A. The g = 2.04 EPR signal-fitted to a Nernst curve with E ′0= −205 mV and the g = 2.02 signal to one withE ′0 = −255 mV. To characterize these signals in more detail, a redox potential-dependent microwave power saturation study was performed. The signals differed considerably in their relaxation properties at 40 K (Fig. 5, B and C). The saturation of the g = 2.02 EPR signal occurred only at microwave powers greater than 10 mW and was independent of the poised potential (Fig. 5 C). In contrast, the g = 2.04 EPR signal exhibited a strong dependence on the redox potential: at −190 mV (when the g = 2.02 feature was only weakly present) power saturation was already observable at 0.2 mW, whereas at −284 mV (when the g = 2.02 signal was strongly developed) the signal required microwave powers >2 mW for saturation. Obviously, the reduction of the “g = 2.02-cluster” strongly influences the relaxation properties of the “g = 2.04-cluster” indicating that these two clusters interact magnetically. Since [4Fe-4S]+1 clusters usually relax much faster than this, we refer to the signals as [2Fe-2S]+1 I (gav = 1.999) and [2Fe-2S]+1 II (gav = 1.986). The maximum spin concentration was 1.5–1.8 spins/monomer of 4-HBCR. It is interesting to note that [2Fe-2S]+1 I has an unusually slow relaxation rate (Fig. 5 B) and was observable at temperatures up to 120 K.Figure 4EPR spectra of 4-HBCR (75 μm) recorded at potentials at −190 mV and −284 mV.

Both features showed substantially faster relaxation than [2Fe-2S]+1 I and II (no saturation occurred at 20 K and 2 mW). Thus, we assign these EPR signal features to the [4Fe-4S]+1 cluster of 4-HBCR. A difference spectrum taken from reduced 4-HBCR at −573 mV at 20 mW and 20 K minus one taken at 2 mW and 40 K is shown in Fig. 6 B. This spectrum could be simulated as a rhombic S = 1/2 species with g values at 2.063, 1.954, and 1.934, which can be interpreted as the EPR signal of a single non-interacting [4Fe-4S]+1cluster. However, due to the complexity of the spectra, presumably because of multiple magnetic interactions, this difference spectrum has to be taken cautiously and may only represent the part of the [4Fe-4S]+1 clusters in a non-interacting form. As described above, this [4Fe-4S] cluster was also identified by Mössbauer spectroscopy; with this technique its redox potential has already been estimated to be substantially more negative than those of the [2Fe-2S] clusters. The gradual rise of the [4Fe-4S]+1 signal features was accompanied by a loss of intensity of all features assigned to [2Fe-2S]+1clusters, e.g. those at g = 2.04, 2.02, and 1.97 (Figs.4 and 6 A). To demonstrate this more clearly, features at g = 2.04 (assigned to [2Fe-2S] I), g = 1.97 (assigned to [2Fe-2S]+1 I and II), g = 2.06, and g = 1.935 (assigned to [4Fe-4S]+1) were plotted versus the redox potential. Both the rise of the EPR signal of the [4Fe-4S]+1 cluster and the disappearance of the features assigned to the [2Fe-2S] clusters followed a Nernst-like curve withE ′0 ∼ −465 mV (Fig.7) giving further evidence that reduction of the [4Fe-4S] cluster was associated with the disappearance of the EPR signals of the [2Fe-2S]+1 clusters. The results obtained from Mössbauer spectroscopy of dithionite-reduced 4-HBCR neither indicated the reduction of the [2Fe-2S]+1clusters to the fully reduced [2Fe-2S]0 state nor the formation of a high-spin system. Thus, we suggest that the complete loss of the low-spin [2Fe-2S]+1 EPR signals results from strong magnetic interactions with each other and/or other paramagnets. Such interactions might result in a broadening and/or a splitting of EPR signals making a clear assignment highly complex. Moreover, the maximal total spin concentration determined at 40 K and 2 mW was 2–2.5 spins/monomeric 4-HBCR at −470 mV. At this potential the [4Fe-4S] cluster was only ∼50% reduced. When the potential was lowered to −573 mV, the spin concentration/monomer decreased again to 1.7 ± 0.3 spins at −573 mV. This suggests that spins were escaping detection due to broadening effects resulting from magnetic interactions among clusters.Figure 6EPR spectra of 4-HBCR (75 μm) recorded between −354 mV and −573 mV.

https://openalex.org/W1975954079,"Sequence similarities between the oligomeric mucins (MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC5B) and the von Willebrand factor suggest that they may be assembled in a similar way. After oligomerization, a fragment corresponding to the D1 and D2 domains is released from the von Willebrand factor. This cleavage does not appear to occur in pig submaxillary mucin, the only mammalian mucin in which this cleavage has been examined thus far, but whether other oligomeric mucins undergo N terminus proteolysis is not known. Antibodies recognizing the D1, D2, D3, and the first Cys domains in MUC5B were established and used to investigate to what extent proteolytic cleavage occurs within the N-terminal part of salivary MUC5B. The antibodies against the D1 and D2 domains identified a polypeptide corresponding in size to a MUC5B fragment generated by cleavage within the D′ domain analogously with the von Willebrand factor propolypeptide. The antibodies did not recognize the main mucin population, suggesting that the major part of salivary MUC5B is subjected to this cleavage. An antibody recognizing the D3 domain was used to reveal a second cleavage site in the “soluble” but not in the “insoluble” MUC5B fraction: the first structural difference observed between soluble and insoluble salivary MUC5B. The identification of these cleavage events shows that the N-terminal sites for MUC5B oligomerization are present in the D3 domain and/or in domains located C-terminal to this part of the molecule.

The human oligomeric mucins have been postulated to be assembled in a manner similar to the vWF (6Gum J.R. Hicks J.W. Toribara N.W. Siddiki B. Kim Y.S. J. Biol.

Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34527-34534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). PSM shows homologies to MUC5B, MUC2, and vWF, including the D1, D2, and D3 domains, and it has been suggested that half-cysteine residues in the D1 and D3 domains are needed for multimerization of this mucin (10Perez-Vilar J. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34527-34534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, the assembly of the various mucins may follow dissimilar pathways. For example, MUC2 occurs as an insoluble complex that resists extraction with guanidinium chloride unless disulfide bonds are cleaved (2Herrmann A. Davies J.R. Lindéll G. Mårtensson S. Packer N.H.

Davies J.R. Carlstedt I. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The formation of insoluble MUC2 and MUC5B is likely to involve “cross-links” in addition to those that join mucin monomers end-to-end into linear structures. Possibly, the non-reducible bonds that (together with disulfide bonds) maintain the integrity of the insoluble MUC2 complex fulfill this function (2Herrmann A. Davies J.R. Lindéll G. Mårtensson S.

The structural difference between soluble and insoluble MUC5B therefore remains to be elucidated. MUC5B has been identified in respiratory tract, endocervical secretions, and saliva (4Wickström C.

MUC5B is the first mucin gene in which both the cDNA and genomic sequences are known (8Desseyn J.-L. Buisine M.-P. Porchet N. Aubert J.-P. Laine A. J. Biol.

The structure predicted from the deduced amino acid sequence of the apoprotein fits well with that postulated previously for cervical mucins, now known to be mainly MUC5B, based on biochemical/biophysical studies (20Carlstedt I. Lindgren H. Sheehan J.K. Biochem. J. 1983; 213: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Knowledge of the MUC5B apoprotein sequence has allowed us to develop antibodies against the N-terminal domains of MUC5B and to investigate whether this mucin is subjected to proteolytic cleavage events similar to those that occur in vWF. Antibodies against the D1 and D2 domains were used to identify a polypeptide with a size expected for a MUC5B fragment generated via proteolytic cleavage in the D′ domain. The antibodies did not recognize the main populations from either soluble or insoluble MUC5B, suggesting that the major part of salivary MUC5B is subjected to this cleavage. An antibody against the D3 domain revealed a second MUC5B fragment from soluble MUC5B, whereas this antibody reactivity remained associated with the mucin monomers obtained from insoluble MUC5B. The identification of this cleavage event may provide a structural explanation for the difference between soluble and insoluble salivary MUC5B. Guanidinium chloride (practical grade) was from ICN Biochemicals (Costa Mesa, CA). Stock solutions of guanidinium chloride (∼8 m) were treated with activated charcoal and filtered through a PM10 filter (Amicon, Beverly, MA) before use. Nitrophenyl phosphate and bovine serum albumin (Fraction V, pH 7.0) were purchased from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany); iodoacetamide and N-ethylmaleimide were purchased from Sigma; dithiothreitol was purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany); and di-isopropyl phosphofluoridate was purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Biotin hydrazide was from Vector Laboratories Inc. (Burlingame, CA), and alkaline phosphatase conjugated streptavidin was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Coverplate immunostaining chambers were from Shandon (Pittsburgh, PA). The horseradish peroxidase- and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit sera, as well as the anti-albumin antibody, StreptABComplex/horseradish peroxidase kit, and the liquid diaminobenzidine substrate-chromogen system, were bought from DAKO (Glostrup, Denmark). The LUM5B-2 antibody raised against a repetitive sequence flanking the glycosylated domains of the MUC5B mucin has been described previously (4Wickström C. Davies J.R. Eriksen G.V. Veerman E.C.I. Carlstedt I. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 685-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The ECL Western detection kit, polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and the Superose 6 column were from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. Ethanol-fixed human tracheal tissue was a kind gift from Dr. Jacques Bara, 482-INSERM, Paris, France. All other reagents were of A.R. or equivalent quality.

An initial injection of 100 μg of peptide in Freund's complete adjuvant given intracutaneously was followed 4 weeks later by a booster injection of 100 μg of peptide in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Rabbits were bled 2–3 weeks later, and the antisera were named LUM5B-5(1-Cys), LUM5ACB-2(D1), LUM5B-7(D2), and LUM5B-10(D3) respectively. Human submandibular/sublingual (HSMSL) saliva was collected from three individuals (data from one individual are shown), and mucins were isolated as described previously (16Wickström C. Christersson C. Davies J.R. Carlstedt I. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In short, saliva was collected on ice and separated into sol and gel phases by ultracentrifugation. The gel phase was extracted using 6 m guanidinium chloride, 5 mm EDTA, and 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, and the remaining residue was brought into solution by reduction. All samples were dialyzed into 6 m guanidinium chloride, 5 mm EDTA, and 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, and subjected to isopycnic density-gradient centrifugation in CsCl and 4 m guanidinium chloride (Beckman 70.1 Ti rotor, 40,000 rpm, 15 °C, 75 h, initial density 1.40 g/ml in a Beckman L-70 Optima centrifuge). Fractions were collected from the bottom of the tubes and analyzed for carbohydrate, A280, density, and antibody reactivity. Rate-zonal centrifugation was performed as described (21Sheehan J.K. Carlstedt I. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Guanidinium chloride gradients (6–8m) were formed in 14 × 89 mm centrifuge tubes using a Hoefer gradient maker connected to an LKB 2232 Microperpex pump at a flow rate of 50 ml/hour. Samples were layered onto the top of the gradients, and tubes were spun in a Beckman L-70 Optima centrifuge (Beckman SW41 Ti rotor, 40,000 rpm, 20 °C for 2 h and 45 min or 8 h). Fractions (300 μl) were collected from the top of the tubes and analyzed for reactivity with the LUM5B-2, LUM5B-5(1-Cys), and LUM5B-10(D3) antisera. Gel chromatography was performed on a Superose 6 column eluted with 4 m guanidinium chloride, pH 7, at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. Fractions (0.25 ml) were analyzed for reactivity against the LUM5B-7(D2) and LUM5ACB-2(D1) antisera and an antibody against albumin. Fractions from the Superose 6 column reacting with the LUM5B-7(D2) and LUM5ACB-2(D1) antisera were pooled and dialyzed against water, freeze-dried, dissolved in 62.5 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 6.8, containing 2.5% (w/v) SDS, 10% glycerol (w/v), 1 mm sodium EDTA, and 0.004% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and subjected to electrophoresis on a 4–16% gradient polyacrylamide gel (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206999) Google Scholar). Protein bands were diffusion blotted on to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blotting, membranes were cut, blocked with 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (blocking solution) for 1 h, and incubated (1 h) with LUM5B-7(D2) (1:500) or LUM5ACB-2(D1) (1:500) antiserum or the anti-albumin antibody (1:300) diluted in blocking solution. The membranes were then incubated (1 h) with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit antibody (1:2000 in blocking solution), and bands were visualized using the ECL Western detection kit. Analysis with the LUM5B-2 antiserum was performed according to Ref. 4Wickström C. Davies J.R. Eriksen G.V. Veerman E.C.I. Carlstedt I. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 685-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar. After appropriate dilution in 4 m guanidinium chloride, 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, samples were coated onto multiwell assay plates (3912, Falcon) overnight at room temperature. After coating, plates were blocked (1 h) with blocking solution and incubated (1 h) with the LUM5B-2, LUM5B-5(1-Cys), and LUM5B-10(D3) antisera diluted 1:1000, the LUM5B-7(D2) and LUM5ACB-2(D1) antisera diluted 1:500, and the anti-albumin antibody diluted 1:300. Reactivity was detected with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit antiserum, diluted 1:2000 in blocking solution using nitrophenyl phosphate (2 mg/ml in 1m diethanolamine/HCl buffer, pH 9.8, containing 5 mm MgCl2) as a substrate. Reactivity is expressed as absorbance at 405 nm after 1 h. Human submandibular gland tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin overnight, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin, and 4-μm sections were cut. Human tracheal tissue was fixed in ethanol and embedded in paraffin, and 4-μm sections were cut. Sections were dewaxed, rehydrated, and treated with 10 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 6, at 100 °C in a microwave oven for 10 min. Sections were reduced using dithiothreitol in 0.1 m Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, at room temperature (30 min) and alkylated with 25 mm iodoacetamide in 0.1 Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0 (30 min). Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by immersion in 3% H2O2 for 30 min. Sections were placed in Coverplate immunostaining chambers (Shandon) and blocked with goat serum for 1 h before endogenous biotin was blocked by treatment with the DAKO biotin blocking kit (avidin for 10 min followed by biotin for 10 min). Sections were then incubated with the LUM5B-2, LUM5B-5(1-Cys), and LUM5B-10(D3) antisera (diluted 1:1000 in blocking solution) as well as the LUM5B-7(D2) or LUM5ACB-2(D1) antisera (diluted 1:500) for 1 h. Antibody binding was detected using the DAKO StreptABComplex/horseradish peroxidase kit followed by DAKO liquid diaminobenzidine substrate-chromogen system. Sections were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin. Density measurements were performed using a Carlsberg pipette as a pycnometer. Carbohydrate content was determined by slot-blotting samples on nitro-cellulose membranes (0.20-μm pore size) and staining with periodic acid/Schiff (PAS) as described (23Thornton D.J. Holmes D.F. Sheehan J.K. Carlstedt I. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Carbohydrate was also detected with the glycan detection method based on the method described (24Devine P.L. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 160-162PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were coated onto multiwell assay plates (3912, Falcon) overnight and washed (also between each subsequent step) with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (washing solution). The plates were then subjected to periodate oxidation, using 25 mm metaperiodate in 0.1m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, for 20 min followed by incubation with biotin hydrazide (2.5 μm in 0.1m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5) for 1 h. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (1:20,000) in washing solution (containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin) was added (1 h), and bound reagent was detected using nitrophenyl phosphate as described for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay above. The antisera raised against the different N-terminal domains of MUC5B were investigated with immunohistochemistry using tissues known to produce MUC5B. LUM5B-5(1-Cys), LUM5B-10(D3), LUM5ACB-2(D1), and LUM5B-7(D2) displayed strong reactivity over the mucous cells in the submucosal glands of human tracheal tissue (Fig. 1,a–d), as is true for the LUM5B-2 antiserum (4Wickström C. Davies J.R. Eriksen G.V. Veerman E.C.I. Carlstedt I. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 685-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). On submandibular gland tissue, the LUM5B-5(1-Cys) and LUM5B-10(D3) antisera reacted strongly (Fig. 1, e and f), whereas the LUM5ACB-2(D1) antibody was much weaker and the LUM5B-7(D2) antiserum did not show any reactivity (results not shown). For some of the antisera, a weak reactivity was seen with the pre-immune sera over non-mucin-producing structures. HSMSL saliva was collected from three individuals (data shown for one) and separated into a sol and a gel phase. Following extraction of the gel with guanidinium chloride, the remaining pellet was brought into solution by reduction. Three fractions were thus obtained and are referred to as: “sol,” “gel-soluble,” and “gel-insoluble.” All samples were subjected to density-gradient centrifugation in CsCl. In the sol phase, carbohydrate analysis revealed a population with a buoyant density between 1.40 and 1.32 g/ml reacting with both PAS and the glycan detection method (Fig. 2 a). A major part of this material comprises the MUC7 mucin (14Carlstedt I. Herrmann A. Karlsson H. Sheehan J. Fransson L.-Å. Hansson G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18771-18781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No MUC5B reactivity was observed using either the LUM5B-2 or the LUM5B-5(1-Cys) antisera (Fig. 2 b). The LUM5ACB-2(D1) and LUM5B-7(D2) antisera reacted with low density material at the top of the gradient, whereas the LUM5B-10(D3) antibody showed no reactivity (Fig. 2 b). In the gel-soluble fraction, two major populations reacting with PAS (as well as with the glycan detection method) were detected at 1.45 and 1.40 g/ml, respectively (Fig. 2 c), and reactivity with the LUM5B-2 and LUM5B-5(1-Cys) antisera followed the higher density one (Fig. 2 d). In contrast, no reactivity was seen using the LUM5ACB-2(D1), LUM5B-7(D2), or LUM5B-10(D3) antisera (Fig. 2 d). In the gel-insoluble fraction, both PAS and the glycan detection method revealed a population at 1.45 g/ml (Fig. 2 e), and reactivity with the LUM5B-2, LUM5B-5(1-Cys), and LUM5B-10(D3) antisera coincided with the carbohydrate analyses (Fig. 2 f). The LUM5ACB-2(D1) and LUM5B-7(D2) antisera showed no reactivity. The top fractions from the density gradient of the sol phase (pooled as indicated in Fig. 2 b) were subjected to gel chromatography on a Superose 6 column before and after reduction. Before reduction, LUM5ACB-2(D1) and LUM5B-7(D2) reactivity coincided as a unimodal peak that was well included on the column. Albumin, as detected with an anti-albumin antibody, coincided with the reactivity of the two MUC5B antisera (Fig. 3 a). After reduction, no changes in elution pattern were observed for the LUM5ACB-2(D1) and LUM5B-7(D2) reactivity, whereas the albumin peak was shifted slightly toward the void volume (Fig. 3 b). Fractions from gel chromatography (pooled as indicated in Fig. 3 a) were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. A single band with an approximate size of 65 kDa was revealed with both the LUM5B-7(D2) and LUM5ACB-2(D1) antibodies (Fig. 4). Albumin was detected at approximately the same position (Fig. 4). After reduction, no change was seen for the LUM5B-7(D2) and LUM5ACB-2(D1) antibodies, whereas albumin appeared as a slightly larger molecule probably due to unfolding of intramolecular disulfide bonds. Mucins from the gel-soluble fraction (pooled as indicated in Fig. 2 c) and cognate subunits, as well as subunits from the gel-insoluble fraction (pooled as indicated in Fig. 2 e), were subjected to rate-zonal centrifugation. “Whole” mucins from the gel-soluble fraction showed a broad range of molecular sizes as revealed by the LUM5B-2 antibody. LUM5B-5(1-Cys) followed the same pattern, although the reactivity was weaker, whereas the LUM5B-10(D3) antibody reacted with a component at the very top of the gradient (Fig. 5 a). Subunits from the gel-insoluble fraction revealed using the LUM5B-2 and LUM5B-5(1-Cys) antibodies were, as expected, much smaller than the whole mucins from the gel-soluble fraction (Fig. 5 c). In contrast to the mucins/mucin subunits from the gel-soluble fraction, the reactivity with the LUM5B-10(D3) antiserum followed that of the LUM5B-2 and LUM5B-5(1-Cys) antisera (Fig. 5 c). To further assess the difference between soluble and insoluble MUC5B from the gel, mucin subunits from the two fractions were subjected to rate-zonal centrifugation for an extended time period. For subunits from soluble MUC5B, the LUM5B-2 and LUM5B-5(1-Cys) antibodies revealed the same broad unimodal peak in the middle of the gradient, and again, the LUM5B-10(D3) antibody reacted only with material in the top fractions (Fig. 5 b). Subunits from insoluble MUC5B appeared at the same position as those from the soluble fraction, but in this case, the reactivity of the LUM5B-10(D3) antiserum coincided with that of LUM5B-2 and LUM5B-5(1-Cys), and no reactivity was present at the top of the gradient (Fig. 5 d). Consequently, the domain recognized by the LUM5B-10(D3) antibody seems to be cleaved off from soluble MUC5B but remains attached to insoluble MUC5B. The apparent lack of reactivity with the LUM5B-10(D3) antibody in the density gradient of soluble MUC5B is probably explained by “competitive coating.” After separation in the rate zonal gradient, no competition for binding to the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate exists between the much larger mucins and the smaller fragment. Antisera were raised against peptides within the D1, D2, D3, and the first Cys domain of MUC5B to investigate whether proteolytic cleavage within the N-terminal part of the apoprotein occurs in this mucin. The antisera were investigated using immunohistochemistry, and LUM5B-5(1-Cys), LUM5B-10(D3), LUM5ACB-2(D1), and LUM5B-7(D2) all reacted strongly over the mucous cells of the tracheal submucosal glands known to produce MUC5B (4Wickström C. Davies J.R. Eriksen G.V. Veerman E.C.I. Carlstedt I. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 685-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The LUM5B-5(1-Cys) and LUM5B-10(D3) antisera showed strong reactivity also on submandibular gland tissue sections, whereas the LUM5ACB-2(D1) and LUM5B-7(D2) antisera displayed weak or no reactivity. Possibly, the lack of reactivity of the two latter antisera in salivary tissue is explained by differences in macromolecular organization within the secretory granules reflected in the observation that a much larger proportion of salivary MUC5B occurs as an insoluble complex than respiratory MUC5B. Alternatively, the fact that the tissue from the salivary gland was fixed in formalin, whereas that from human trachea was fixed in ethanol, could explain the differences. However, the results show that all antibodies do recognize the MUC5B apoprotein. Antisera against sequences within the D1 and D2 domains of MUC5B reacted with low density material at the top of the gradient and did not recognize the main mucin populations from the gel-soluble fraction and the gel-insoluble fraction. Consequently, a major part of the N-terminal end of MUC5B appears to be cleaved off, giving rise to a less glycosylated low density fragment that is separated from the highly glycosylated high density mucins. When the putative fragment was subjected to gel chromatography, the two antisera recognizing the D1 and D2 domain, respectively, identified the same peak, suggesting that they recognize the same component. No effects were observed after reduction, suggesting that the putative MUC5B fragment is a monomeric structure. SDS-PAGE/Western blotting of this component resulted in a well defined band, and again, the two antisera identified the same component, which is of approximately the same size as albumin. Because albumin is of approximately the same size as the combined D1 and D2 domains and because the antiserum against the D1 domain is raised against a sequence in the N-terminal part of this domain, we propose that the MUC5B fragment identified results from a cleavage event in the D′ domain (Fig. 6). The D1 and D2 domains of vWF (741 amino acids) comprise the so-called vWF propolypeptide, which is crucial for the formation of the oligomeric form of this protein. Cleavage of the vWF propolypeptide occurs in the D′ domain between Arg and Ser residues in positions Lys762-Arg763-Ser764 (25Verweij C.L. Hart M. Pannekoek H. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2885-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This KRS sequence is not present in the N-terminal end of MUC5B, but there are several other paired basic amino acid sites that may provide substrate (for example, the proprotein convertases known to cleave at such sites (for a review, see Ref. 26Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar)). If indeed cleavage occurs in the D′ domain, the Arg843-Arg844 sequence could be a potential site. However, whether the cleavage events in MUC5B reported here influence assembly of the mucin is not clear at present. In a previous study, we have shown that the major part of the MUC5B mucin from HSMSL saliva is insoluble, i.e. it resists extraction with 6 m guanidinium chloride (16Wickström C. Christersson C. Davies J.R. Carlstedt I. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The structural basis for this is not known; however, the complex can be brought into solution by cleaving disulfide bonds. Using rate-zonal centrifugation, a second fragment was identified in the preparation of soluble MUC5B using an antibody recognizing a sequence in the D3 domain. This component is likely to be highly glycosylated since it banded with the main mucin population. The fragment is apparently only released from soluble MUC5B because the reactivity with the antiserum against the D3 domain is retained with the mucin subunits from insoluble MUC5B following rate zonal centrifugation. The significance of this cleavage event remains to be established; however, it represents the first structural difference identified between soluble and insoluble salivary MUC5B. The possibility that differences in the solubility/structure of mucins may be determined by proteolytic cleavage events provides a conceptually new idea on how the properties of mucus, and thus the protection of mucosal surfaces, may be regulated and modulated between tissues to meet local physiological demands. Extensive studies on PSM have shown that this mucin forms C-to-C dimers in the endoplasmic reticulum (12Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9845-9850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Perez-Vilar J. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6982-6988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) followed by N-to-N multimerization through the D-domains in the distal part of the Golgi (10Perez-Vilar J. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34527-34534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). CGLCG sequences in the D1 and D3 domains have been suggested to be crucial for N-to-N multimerization, and these sequences are highly conserved in other secreted mucins, including MUC5B. No evidence for proteolytic cleavage in the N-terminal part of PSM was found (10Perez-Vilar J. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34527-34534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although the D1 domain in MUC5B from human saliva seems to be cleaved off and the soluble MUC5B species apparently lack the D3 domain, this glycoprotein is still an oligomeric structure. Consequently, the postulated N-to-N-terminal association in human salivary MUC5B oligomers must occur in the C-terminal part of the D3 domain and/or in domains that are C-terminal of this structure (Fig. 6). Possibly, additional disulfide bonds within the D3 domain provide the cross-link(s) necessary to form insoluble MUC5B. In the prepro-vWF, non-covalent interactions between the D1 and D2 domains are thought to “align” the D3 and A domains, which then form disulfide bonds between the vWF dimers (25Verweij C.L. Hart M. Pannekoek H. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2885-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 27Wise R.J. Pittman D.D. Handin R.I. Kaufman R.J. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1988; 52: 229-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Analogously, the role of the D1 and D2 domains in MUC5B might be to act as “docking” structures that after “alignment” and disulfide bond formation may be removed without compromising the oligomeric mucin structure. Free vWF propolypeptide is found as dimers associated by non-covalent bonds in plasma (28Wagner D.D. Fay P.J. Sporn L.A. Sinha S. Lawrence S.O. Marder V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1955-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) in keeping with this idea. The apparent difference in N-terminal cleavage between PSM and human salivary MUC5B could be due to species differences, a difference between individual mucins, or possibly a lack of the enzyme responsible for cleavage in the cells used to study the PSM constructs. Alternatively, the N terminus cleavage of MUC5B may be a post-secretory event mediated by salivary proteases co-secreted with HSMSL. N-terminal cleavage is not essential for vWF oligomerization (25Verweij C.L. Hart M. Pannekoek H. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2885-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and oligomerization could well proceed without N-terminal cleavage. To our knowledge it is not known whether or not PSM isolated from gland tissue has been subjected to N-terminal cleavage. In this study, we demonstrate that proteolytic cleavage may occur in the N terminus of MUC5B, giving rise to a fragment that corresponds in size to the vWF propeptide and thus adding further evidence to the postulated similarities between this protein and the human oligomeric mucins. A second cleavage event may provide a structural explanation for the difference between soluble and insoluble MUC5B in saliva. We thank Annika Böök for contributions to this work."

HPOs with substituents at the 1- and 2-positions of the pyridinone ring have been synthesized, and their inhibitory properties compared with those of desferrioxamine (DFO). Varying the alkyl substituents does not affect the affinity constant of these ligands for iron(III), but permits a systematic investigation of the effect of hydrophobicity and molecular shape on inhibitory properties. The inhibition of RR was monitored, indirectly by measuring tritiated thymidine incorporation into DNA and directly by the quantification of the EPR signal of the enzyme tyrosyl radical. 5-LO inhibition was examined spectrophotometrically, measuring the rate of linoleic hydroperoxide formation by soybean lipoxygenase. The results indicate that the substituent size introduced at the 2-position of the HPO ring is critical for determining inhibition of both enzymes. Large substituents on the 2-position, introduce a steric factor which interferes with accessibility to the iron centers. These studies have identified chelators such as 1,6-dimethyl-2-(N-4′,N-propylsuccinamido)methyl-3-hydroxypyridin-4-one (CP358), which causes only a 10% inhibition of 5-LO after 24 h of incubation at 110 μm IBE (iron-binding equivalents) in comparison to simple dialkyl HPOs such as Deferiprone (CP20) which cause up to 70% inhibition. Using EPR spectroscopy, CP358 inhibits RR at a slower rate than CP20, while chelating intracellular iron(III) at a similar rate, a finding consistent with an indirect inhibition of the tyrosyl radical. However, hepatocellular iron is mobilized at a faster rate by CP358 (P < 0.001). These findings demonstrate that it is possible to design bidentate HPOs which access intracellular iron pools rapidly while inhibiting non-heme iron-containing enzymes relatively slowly, at rates comparable to DFO. It is anticipated that such compounds will possess a superior therapeutic safety margin to currently available bidentate HPOs.

This work suggested that the hydrophobicity of bidentate hydroxypyridinones was important in determining the rate of inhibition of these enzymes, but the larger size of DFO might also limit inhibition of these enzymes. In these previous studies, however, variation of the substitution was only examined in the 1-position of the pyridinone ring (R1) (Fig.1), and it was not possible to differentiate the size and shape effects from those of hydrophobicity. In the present investigation, we have therefore undertaken a detailed structure-activity investigation of a range of such inhibitors, employing substituents in both the 1- and 2-positions of the pyridinone ring, with a view to identifying the principal physicochemical properties of hydroxypyridinones that determine the rate of inhibition of 5-LO and RR. We have further sought to identify hydroxypyridinones that inhibit these enzymes as slowly as DFO but maintain their ability to mobilize intracellular iron. Lipoxygenases are non-heme iron-containing enzymes that catalyze the site-specific oxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids to produce hydroperoxides. 5-LO is the principal lipoxygenase in the human neutrophil, and it catalyzes the first two steps in the conversion of its substrate arachidonic acid to leukotriene A4 which is the precursor of the potent inflammatory mediator leukotriene B4 (9Musser J.H.

Each of the two subunits consists of two identical polypeptide chains. An equimolar complex of both subunits is necessary for activity (17Reichard P.

The small subunit R2 contains (bound to each polypeptide chain) an oxygen-linked diferric metal center which, via a redox cycle, generates and stabilizes a tyrosyl radical during the steady state turnover of the enzyme (17Reichard P. Science. 1993; 260: 1773-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The two octahedrally coordinated iron atoms in each center are doubly bridged by an oxo ligand and coordinated by a single glutamate carboxylate. The coordination about each iron is completed by histidine, aspartate, glutamate, and water (18Nordlund P. Sjoberg B.M. Eklund H. Nature. 1990; 345: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). The tyrosyl radical is located in a hydrophobic pocket and is buried within the protein matrix at a depth of at least 10 Å from the surrounding solvent (17Reichard P. Science. 1993; 260: 1773-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 18Nordlund P. Sjoberg B.M. Eklund H. Nature. 1990; 345: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). The E. coli protein R2 possesses conformational flexibility that may permit small molecules access to the interior of the protein (19Gerez C. Fontecave M.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the mouse R2 protein has a more exposed active site topology in comparison to that of the E. coli R2 protein. Indeed, the three-dimensional structure of mouse R2 shows the existence of a hydrophobic channel that reaches about 10 Å from the surface to the proposed oxygen reaction site close to the tyrosine radical (26Kauppi B. Nielsen B.B. Ramaswamy S. Kjoller Larsen I. Thelander M. Thelander L. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 706-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the iron center of mouse R2 has a less hydrogen-bonded environment that makes it more open and accessible. Iron chelators can inhibit RR by forming a ternary complex with the enzyme-bound iron, chelating the iron center in the active site of the enzyme or by depriving the precursor iron from the newly synthesized enzyme pool. This study reports a systematic investigation whereby we attempt to determine the structural and physiochemical requirements for the inhibitory actions of the 3-hydroxypyridin-4-one (HPO) chelators on both the metalloenzymes RR and 5-LO. Such an investigation will generate an improved understanding of the mechanism of RR and 5-LO inhibition by these chelators. It will also provide the opportunity to identify an HPO chelator with minimal inhibitory properties toward these enzymes. Such a chelator should have potential for the clinical treatment of diseases of iron overload such as β-thalassemia. To achieve these goals, we synthesized a series of HPO chelators with different substituents at the R1 and R2positions of the pyridinone ring (Table I), and we studied their inhibitory properties. Substituents introduced at these positions do not markedly influence the affinities of these ligands for iron(III). The 1- and 2-substituted 3-hydroxypyridin-4-ones were synthesized as described previously (27Dobbin P.S. Hider R.C. Hall A.D. Taylor P.D. Sarpong P. Porter J.B. Xiao G. Van der Helm D. J. Med.

Lipophilicity was quantified by the measurement of the distribution coefficient (D7.4) of the chelators between n-octanol and Tris buffer (pH 7.4) (27Dobbin P.S. Hider R.C. Hall A.D. Taylor P.D. Sarpong P. Porter J.B. Xiao G. Van der Helm D. J. Med. Chem. 1993; 36: 2448-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Desferrioxamine (Desferal®) was purchased from Ciba-Geigy. Human transferrin (98% pure), DNase I (type III), RNase (type I), soybean lipoxygenase, soybean trypsin inhibitor, penicillin, gentamicin, and insulin were from Sigma. Collagenase (type I) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All radiochemicals were from Amersham Biosciences. Aquasol was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. RPMI 1640 medium and fetal calf serum were from Life Technologies, Inc., and PBS was from Oxoid (UK). All other chemicals were of analytical grade. The Student's t test (unpaired) was used to identify significant differences between sample means. The different HPO structures were optimized in the three-dimensional mode using the ACD/ChemSketch program. The distance (Å) between the methyl carbon of the R6 substituent (Fig.1 and Table I) or the carbon at the 6th position of the aromatic ring was applicable, and the final carbon of the R2 substituent was then calculated automatically by the same program. Soybean lipoxygenase (sbLPO) is a 15-lipoxygenase that catalyzes the peroxidation of its preferential substrate linoleic acid to linoleic hydroperoxide. The inhibition of the enzyme was monitored as a decrease in absorption by the product linoleic hydroperoxide at 234 nm. Briefly, sbLPO was prepared as a 10,000 units ml−1 stock in 0.2m borate buffer (pH 9.0) and linoleic acid as a 3.2m stock in ethanol. The enzyme (final concentration 500 units/3.0 ml reaction volume) was preincubated with chelator or the respective diluent for the appropriate times, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of linoleic acid (667 μm in borate buffer). The rate of reaction in the absence and presence of various compounds was determined using the molar absorption coefficient of the hydroperoxide (e = 23,600m−1 cm−1) (8Abeysinghe R.D. Roberts P.J.

The human K562 erythroleukemia cell line was grown in suspension culture in tissue culture flasks, in RPMI 1640 medium containing l-glutamine, supplemented with 5% (v/v) FCS at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. The cells were cultured at a density of 1 × 105 cells/ml to ensure that the exponential growth was maintained. Cell viability was measured by ethidium bromide/acridine orange fluorescence microscopy (30Mills K. Armitage R. Worman C. Immunol. Lett. 1983; 6: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated the chelators were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). HPO chelator solutions were prepared once a week and stored at 4 °C. DFO was freshly prepared for each experiment. The chelators were added to the cells from a 10× concentrated stock solution in PBS. The same volume of PBS was added to the control samples. The concentrations of chelators added to the culture medium are expressed as iron binding equivalents (IBE) for each chelator. The hexadentate chelator, DFO, coordinates iron in a 1:1 ratio, whereas the bidentate HPOs coordinate in a 3:1 ratio. A K562 cell suspension (0.9 ml), of greater than 95% viability, in exponential growth was incubated with 100 μl of chelator in a 24-well plate. Following treatment with the chelators, 200 μl of cell suspensions were plated in a 96-well microtiter plate and pulsed with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine for 1 h to assess cellular DNA synthesis. Cells were harvested onto glass fiber filters with an Automash 2000 (Dynatech). Incorporation of3H label was measured by liquid scintillation counting after addition of aquasol scintillation fluid (2Hoyes K.P. Hider R.C. Porter J.B. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4591-4599PubMed Google Scholar). Hepatocyte isolation and oxygenation were performed as described previously (32Berry M.N. Friend D.C. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 43: 506-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (3633) Google Scholar, 33Young S.P. Aisen P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 633: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Adult male Wistar rats (200–400 g) were anesthetized with Hypnorm (Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Grove, Oxford, UK) and diazepam (CP Pharmaceuticals, Wrexham, UK), and the portal vein was cannulated and the liver removed. The isolated liver was perfused for 10 min with calcium-free bicarbonate-buffered Hanks' solution (pH 7.4) to remove the red blood cells before adding collagenase to the perfusate (final perfusate solution, 100 ml of Hanks' solution containing 50 mg of collagenase, 5 mg of DNase, 5 mg of RNase, 10 mg of soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 200 μm CaCl2). The collagenase perfusate was recirculated for 15 min before lightly mincing the liver in a sterile beaker. The mixed liver cell suspension was filtered through 250-, 85-, and 63-μm nylon meshes after each of three sedimentation steps at 400 rpm for 5 min to remove nonparenchymal cells. Two further sedimentations were performed in sterile culture medium before plating cells for primary culture. Culture medium was RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 12 μg/ml insulin. The resulting hepatocyte suspensions were greater than 95% pure as judged by light microscopy (34Porter J.B. Gyparaki M. Burke L.C. Huehns E.R. Sarpomg P. Saez V. Hider R.C. Blood. 1988; 72: 1497-1503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell viability following centrifugation was estimated by fluorescence microscopy using ethidium bromide and acridine orange. Suspensions containing less than 80% viable cells were not used. Cell were suspended in culture medium to a final concentration of 0.5 × 106/ml, and 3 ml of suspension added to each 60-mm collagen-coated plastic plate (Primeria Falcon 3802, Falcon Labware, Oxnard, CA). Plates were cultured at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. After primary adherence for 4 h, the plates were washed four times with RPMI to remove nonviable, nonadherent cells. The viability of adherent cells was >95%. Cell viability could generally be maintained at this level for over 48 h (34Porter J.B. Gyparaki M. Burke L.C. Huehns E.R. Sarpomg P. Saez V. Hider R.C. Blood. 1988; 72: 1497-1503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After the removal of nonadherent cells, 2 ml of culture medium containing 59Fe human diferric transferrin at a 100 μg/ml final concentration was added (34Porter J.B. Gyparaki M. Burke L.C.

The cells were pulsed with this medium for 16 h before decanting the medium and washed four times over a known time period with RPMI, and fresh medium with or without the compound to be tested for its iron-releasing properties was added at 110 μm IBE. To measure the time course of59Fe release, medium was removed for 59Fe counting and replaced with fresh medium (2 ml) after 2 and 6 h. At the end of the release experiment, the medium was decanted, the adherent cells removed from the plate, and the radioactivity measured on an LKB Compugamma 1282 counter (Amersham Biosciences). Cell damage was monitored by measuring lactate dehydrogenase in the incubation medium. Cell viability was determined at the end of the experiment by fluorescence microscopy. As human K562 leukemia cells give a sufficiently strong tyrosine radical signal for the kinetics of inhibition and regeneration to be studied in intact cells (7Cooper C.E. Lynagh G.R. Hoyes K.P. Hider R.C. Cammack R. Porter J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20291-20299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), we have therefore used this cell line to investigate the rate of suppression of the tyrosyl radical of intracellular ribonucleotide reductase by different HPO chelators. K562 cells were cultured at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium with 5% (v/v) FCS under CO2/air (1:19). Cell stocks were maintained at 2–6 × 105 cells/ml. To ensure that cells were in exponential growth, media was changed 24 h prior to each experiment; cell viability as determined by ethidium bromide/acridine orange fluorescence microscopy was greater than 95% for all experiments. During experiments cells were grown at 4–5 × 105 cells/ml (200 ml/flask). HPO chelators were added from a 10× concentrated stock solution in PBS to give a final concentration of 330 μm IBE, and an equivalent volume of PBS was added for the control sample. Cells were prepared for EPR analysis by centrifuging at 500 × g for 3 min at 0 °C, removing the supernatant, and vortex-mixing the cell pellet. 200-μl aliquots were frozen in EPR tubes. The tubes containing the cells were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. The overall time taken for spinning and freezing was less than 6 min. K562 cells were stored in liquid nitrogen and analyzed using a high quality spherical resonator (SP9703) on a Bruker EMX EPR spectrometer with an Oxford Instruments liquid helium cryostat. Each tube contained 80–100 million cells (0.5 ml total volume). The spectra were recorded at 30 K under nonsaturating conditions as follows: 20 milliwatts for the iron complexes (g = 4.3) and 2 milliwatts for the tyrosyl radical (g = 2). To show the structure of the radical, spectra in the g = 2 region were recorded at 0.5-millitesla modulation amplitude, whereas those at g = 4.3 were recorded with 1-millitesla modulation amplitude. There are significant signals from other metalloproteins in these cells that can obscure the tyrosyl radical signal. To remove these signals, a varying amount of a background spectrum was subtracted from the experimental signal until the interference was minimized. This background was obtained by incubation of K562 cells with the relevant chelator (at 330 μm) for 24 h. No tyrosyl radical was observable in the background spectra. The relative concentration of the tyrosyl radical under different conditions was obtained by measuring the peak minus the trough value of the signal. To account for background species, the spectra were compared relative to control and radical-free (background) spectra. The signal in the absence of chelator addition was arbitrarily set to 1, and the signal in the radical-free background was set to 0 (7Cooper C.E. Lynagh G.R. Hoyes K.P. Hider R.C. Cammack R. Porter J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20291-20299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Absolute quantification of the intracellular high spin ferric chelator complex was obtained by comparing the signal size with a standard curve obtained from the EPR signals of saturated iron chelator complexes of known concentration. These iron complexes were prepared by adding iron (ferrous ammonium sulfate dissolved in 0.05 mH2SO4), 0–80 μm dropwise to the chelator in PBS. The pH was adjusted to 7.4 immediately after the addition of iron. The iron:chelator ratio adopted for the preparation of these HPO-iron complexes was 1:3.1 (36Hoyes K.P. Jones H.M. Abeysinghe R.D. Hider R.C. Porter J.B. Exp. Haematol. 1993; 21: 86-92PubMed Google Scholar). The HPO chelators (CP20–CP26) investigated were all found to be potent inhibitors of both 5-LO and DNA synthesis, because without exception they caused >20% inhibition of DNA synthesis after only 1 h of incubation with K562 cells at a concentration of 11 μm IBE (Fig. 2) and ≥40% inhibition of 5-LO after 30 min of incubation at 110 μmIBE (Table II). In contrast to the large variation observed by this series of chelators in terms of their percentage 5-LO inhibition (TableII), there is only a slight variation between this series of chelators in terms of their percentage inhibition of DNA synthesis. The HPO currently in clinical use, CP20 was found to be the least potent inhibitor of the series, causing 22% inhibition of DNA synthesis, at 11 μm IBE, compared with 32% inhibition caused by the more hydrophobic CP26, the most potent of the series (Fig. 2). As the concentration (μm IBE) of the HPO chelators increased from 11 μm IBE to 330 μm IBE, a further increase in the inhibition of DNA s"

We report here that, in Rhodobacter capsulatus, complete restoration of proton uptake (upon formation of QA− and QB−) to the level found in the wild type is observed in a mutant reaction center in which a tyrosine substitution in the QA environment (AlaM247 → Tyr) is coupled with mutations of acidic residues near QB (GluL212 → Ala/AspL213 → Ala) that initially cancel the proton uptake above pH 8. This result demonstrates that proton uptake occurs by strong cooperation between structural motifs, such as hydrogen-bonded networks, that span the 18 Å distance between the two quinone acceptors.

The reaction center is composed of the L, M, and H proteins. The L and M subunits carry all the cofactors involved in the initial electron transfer chain. The first photochemical event, which initiates the rapid photo-oxidation of a dimer of bacteriochlorophylls (“P”), results in the injection of an electron into the so-called quinone electron acceptor system formed by the primary and secondary quinones, QA, and QB, respectively. Thermodynamic equilibrium between the two semiquinones states, QA− and QB−, is achieved because the rate of electron transfer from QA− to QB is much greater than either the P+QA− → PQAor P+QB− → PQB charge recombination processes. After two successive absorptions of a photon, the doubly reduced and doubly protonated form of the secondary quinone QB is produced. The differential energetic stabilization between QA− and QB− is essential to ensure a high yield of energy conversion. In fact, the partial protonation of residues whose pK a values are shifted by the formation of QA− and QB− fulfills this role (1McPherson P.H. Okamura M.Y. Feher G. Biochim. Biophys.

Very few polar or charged groups are found in the QA environment whereas the QB neighborhood is rich in protonatable and polar groups. In particular, AspL213 and GluL212, situated respectively at 5 and 6 Å from QB, form a strongly interacting acidic cluster, the ionization state of which modulates the electrostatic properties of the QB binding pocket. GluH173and AspL210 have also been suggested to participate in this interactive group, designated as the “QB cluster” (3Alexov E.G. Gunner M.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8253-8270Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar,6Alexov E.G. Gunner M.R. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2075-2093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Because of the strong pairwise interactions between these residues, the cluster responds as a whole to the formation of either QB− or QA− (situated at approximately 18 Å from QB) (3Alexov E.G.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10487-10496Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The hydrogen bond networks formed by water molecules and polar groups lying between QA and QB also have been suggested to participate in the electrostatic response of the protein to the introduction of an electron (7Beroza P. Fredkin D.R. Okamura M.Y. Feher G. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 2233-2250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 8Lancaster C.R. Michel H. Honig B. Gunner M.R. Biophys.

The electrostatic interactions between the cluster and QA− or QB− or within the cluster itself can be probed by measuring the stoichiometries of proton uptake for reaction centers in the QA−(H+/QA−) and the QB−(H+/QB−) states, respectively. In the native reaction centers from Rhodobacter capsulatus and Rhodobacter sphaeroides, it has previously been reported that for both the QA− and QB− states, this cluster (in which a main participant is GluL212) has a signature reflected by the presence of a proton uptake band at high pH (9Brzezinski P.

In fact, a mathematical model, which describes the interactions of three or four (or more) strongly interacting acidic groups, suggests that this band arises from a cumulative effect of pairwise pK a shifts of the different components within the cluster. 1P. Sebban, L. Baciou, and J. Lavergne, unpublished data. Interestingly, the model suggests that when any residue within the cluster is replaced (for example by a non-protonatable residue), the high pH band of the whole cluster disappears or is, at least, notably displaced to lower pH. This effect has been observed experimentally in R. capsulatus and R. sphaeroides reaction centers in which GluL212 has been mutated to Gln or Ala (9Brzezinski P. Paddock M.L. Okamura M.Y. Feher G.

We show here that in R. capsulatus, a wild-type pattern of the H+/QA− and H+/QB− proton uptake pH dependence is fully restored in the AA double mutant when AlaM247, the structural equivalent of AspL213, is replaced by a Tyr. The effect of this mutation is to extend the hydrogen bond network in the QA environment. We suggest that strong interactions involving extended hydrogen-bonded networks between QA and QB (18 Å) are directly involved in the proton uptake by the protein. The single and triple mutant that we have constructed are the AlaM247 → Tyr and GluL212→ Ala/AspL213 → Ala/AlaM247 → Tyr. The GluL212 → Ala/AspL213 → Ala double mutant has been described previously (14Hanson D.K. Tiede D.M. Nance S.L. Chang C.H. Schiffer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The H+/QA− and H+/QB− proton uptake stoichiometries were measured in the presence of 100 μmferrocene as electron donor to P+ and 300 μmferrocyanide. In both types of measurements, pH electrodes and pH-sensitive dyes were combined. When using pH-sensitive dyes, the proton uptake by the RCs2 was measured by following the absorption changes at 585 nm (isosbestic point of P absorption changes). The calibrations were performed by additions of known amounts of HCl (1 m stock; Merck). The H+/QA− proton uptake stoichiometries were measured in the presence of terbutryn (100 μm), which prevents the binding of QB. The proton uptake by the PQAQB− state (ΔHQAQB−+) is deduced from the measured value after one flash (ΔHobs+) according to the following equation (10McPherson P.H. Schönfeld M. Paddock M.L. Okamura M.Y. Feher G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1181-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).ΔHQAQB−+=ΔHobs+−[δ+α(1−δ)]ΔHQA−+(1−α)(1−δ)Equation 1 ΔHQA−+ the proton uptake by the RC in the absence of QB. The fraction of RCs without QB activity (δ) and the partition coefficient between the QA−QB and QAQB− states (α) were determined from the P+QB−→ PQB charge recombination kinetics monitored at 430 nm. The conditions were as follows: 2 μm reaction centers, 50 mm NaCl, 0.03% Triton X-100, 200 μmferrocene, 40 μm dye (bromcresol purple, phenol red, cresol red, or o-cresol phthalein depending on the pH). The buffer concentration was kept below 10 μm by extensive dialysis. The buffers (<10 μm) used were MES (Sigma) between pH 5.5 and 6.5, Bis-Tris propane (Sigma) between pH 6.3 and 9.5, and CAPS (Calbiochem) above pH 9.5. The residues in the QA pocket that are symmetry-related to GluL212and AspL213 are AlaM246 and AlaM247. To reverse this charge asymmetry, a photosynthetically incompetent quadruple mutant (GluL212→ Ala/AspL213 → Ala/AlaM246 → Glu/AlaM247 → Asp) was constructed in R. capsulatus (15Hanson D.K. Schiffer M. Photosynth. Res. 1998; 55: 275-280Crossref Google Scholar). A spontaneous phenotypic revertant carrying the AlaM247 → Tyr mutation near QA was isolated (15Hanson D.K. Schiffer M. Photosynth. Res. 1998; 55: 275-280Crossref Google Scholar, 16Valerio-Lepiniec M. Miksovska J. Schiffer M. Hanson D.K. Sebban P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We investigate here the electrostatic interactions probed by the stoichiometries of proton uptake in engineered mutants carrying the AlaM247 → Tyr mutation in combination with either a WT or AA QB pocket. The pH dependences of the H+/QA− and H+/QB− stoichiometries in the reaction centers of the TyrM247 and the AA + TyrM247 mutants are presented in Fig.1, a and b. The pH dependences of the H+/QA−and the H+/QB−stoichiometries were previously described for the WT (13Maróti P. Hanson D.K. Schiffer M. Sebban P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1057-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 17Sebban P. Maróti P. Hanson D.K. Biochimie (Paris). 1995; 77: 677-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and AA mutant reaction centers (13Maróti P. Hanson D.K. Schiffer M. Sebban P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1057-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); they are also displayed in Fig. 1,a and b. At neutral pH, the H+/QA− and the H+/QB− curves of the WT and AA mutant reaction centers are superimposable, within the experimental error. However, above pH 7.5–8.0, at variance to the data from the WT reaction centers, in the AA mutant reaction centers, the H+/QA− and H+/QB− proton uptake drops to reach a value close to 0. As displayed in Fig. 1, a andb, the addition of the compensatory mutation AlaM247 → Tyr to the AA QB pocket restores the proton uptake profiles in the QA−and QB− states to those observed for the WT reaction centers. Interestingly, reaction centers carrying the single AlaM247 → Tyr mutation display the same H+/QA− curve as the WT reaction centers (Fig. 1 a), suggesting that proton uptake at high pH in the AA + TyrM247 mutant is not due to the tyrosine per se. The role played by the association of TyrM247 with its environment in the overall proton uptake response of the protein is highlighted in the notably increased H+/QB− stoichiometry measured in the TyrM247 single mutant as compared with the WT (Fig. 1 b). Indeed, the H+/QB− values measured in the single mutant varies in the range 0.9–0.8 from pH 6 to 9.5. The restoration of a WT-like high pH band in both the H+/QA− and H+/QB− stoichiometries by the addition of the AlaM247 → Tyr mutation to RC proteins lacking GluL212 and AspL213 suggests that the proton uptake above pH 8 is not specifically associated with the QB cluster. Instead, this high pH signature reflects the existence of a wide network, extending over the entire cytoplasmic side of the protein, in which strong delocalized interactions take place. To structurally investigate the modifications induced by the mutations, we have crystallized reaction centers of the equivalent mutant of R. sphaeroides (AA + TyrM249). 3P. R. Pokkuluri, P. D. Laible, J. L. Ford, D. K. Hanson, and M. Schiffer, unpublished data. The three-dimensional structure of the quinone region of this mutant is presented in Fig. 2. The difference electron density map suggests a position for the tyrosine side chain that is close to the one that was modeled previously (16Valerio-Lepiniec M. Miksovska J. Schiffer M. Hanson D.K. Sebban P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In fact, the side chain is located in a cavity that is filled with a cluster of water molecules that is seen in structures of WT reaction centers (18Fritzsch G. Kampmann L. Kapaun G. Michel H. Photosynth. Res. 1998; 55: 127-132Crossref Google Scholar, 19Ermler U. Fritzsch G. Buchanan S.K. Michel H.

((19); Protein Data Bank entry code 1pcr)). Some of these waters are likely to develop hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl group of TyrM247. Interestingly, this water cluster is connected to water chains closer to QB that join QB and the QB cluster to the QA environment. Restoration of wild-type levels of H+/QA− and H+/QB− proton uptake in the AA + TyrM247 mutant reaction centers suggests that TyrM247 induces interactions that mimic those of the acidic QB cluster present in the WT reaction center and that these hydrogen bond networks are involved in this process. In the WT, the interactions and the associated proton uptake events that differentially stabilize QA− and QB− are likely to be ensured by a hydrogen-bonded network that strongly couples the QBcluster to the QA environment, 18 Å away. We thank Drs. M. R. Gunner and J. Lavergne for helpful discussions during this work and Raj Pokkuluri for the structure figure."

Since these γ subunits differ in both primary structure and isoprenoid modification, we examined the relative contributions of each to Gβγ interaction with receptors. We constructed baculoviruses encoding γ1 and γ2 subunits with altered CAAX (where A is an aliphatic amino acid) motifs to direct alternate or no prenylation of the γ chains and a set of γ1 and γ2 chimeras with the γ2 CAAX motif at the carboxyl terminus. All the γ constructs coexpressed with β1 in Sf9 cells yielded β1γ dimers, which were purified to near homogeneity, and their affinities for receptors and Gα were quantitatively determined. Whereas alteration of the isoprenoid of γ1 from farnesyl to geranylgeranyl and of γ2 from geranylgeranyl to farnesyl had no impact on the affinities of β1γ dimers for Gαt, the non-prenylated β1γ2 dimer had significantly diminished affinity. Altered prenylation resulted in a <2-fold decrease in affinity of the β1γ2dimer for rhodopsin and a <3-fold change for the β1γ1 dimer. In each case with identical isoprenylation, the β1γ2 dimer displayed significantly greater affinity for rhodopsin compared with the β1γ1 dimer. Furthermore, dimers containing chimeric Gγ chains with identical geranylgeranyl modification displayed rhodopsin affinities largely determined by the carboxyl-terminal one-third of the protein. These results indicate that isoprenoid modification of the Gγ subunit is essential for binding to both Gα and receptors. The isoprenoid type influences the binding affinity for receptors, but not for Gα.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4711) Google Scholar). G proteins are composed of three polypeptides: a GTP-binding α subunit and a dimer of β and γ subunits that functions as a monomer. Ligand-activated G protein-coupled receptors catalyze the exchange of GTP for GDP tightly bound to the inactive Gα subunit, resulting in dissociation of the GTP-activated α subunit from both its cognate Gβγ dimer and the receptor. The GTP-activated α subunit and the dissociated Gβγ dimer in turn regulate intracellular effectors (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4711) Google Scholar, 2Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). At least 20 different α subunits, 5 β subunits, and 12 γ subunits (3Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar) have been identified to date. Such a diversity of structures is believed to contribute importantly to the specificity of signaling through these pathways. It is well established that the selective interaction between receptors and the Gα subunits provides a major determinant of signaling specificity. There are numerous examples of the selectivity of receptors for Gα subunits. For example, the β-adrenergic receptor couples primarily to members of the Gαs family (4Green S.A. Holt B.D. Liggett S.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 889-893PubMed Google Scholar, 5Rubenstein R.C. Linder M.E. Ross E.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10769-10777Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 6Strulovici B. Cerione R.A. Kilpatrick B.F. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1984; 225: 837-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), whereas the α2A-adrenergic receptor couples to members of the Gαi family (7Chabre O. Conklin B.R. Brandon S. Bourne H.R. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5730-5734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Nasman J. Jansson C.C. Akerman K.E. J. Biol.

G protein-coupled receptors can even display remarkable selectivity among closely related Gα structures. The bombesin receptor subtypes selectively couple with different subtypes of Gαq (11Jian X. Sainz E. Clark W.A. Jensen R.T. Battey J.F. Northup J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11573-11581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A growing body of evidence also points to the contribution of βγ subunits in determining receptor-G protein coupling selectivity. The role of βγ diversity in the specificity of G protein signaling is supported by both in vivo and in vitro studies. Antisense RNA constructs for Gα, Gβ, and Gγ selectively disrupt receptor signaling in rat pituitary GH3 cells (12Kleuss C. Scherubl H. Hescheler J. Schultz G. Wittig B. Science. 1993; 259: 832-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 13Kleuss C. Scherubl H. Hescheler J. Schultz G. Wittig B. Nature. 1992; 358: 424-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). These studies have demonstrated a specific requirement of β3and γ4 subunits for muscarinic receptor signaling, whereas β1 and γ3 subunits mediate somatostatin receptor signaling. Also, ribozyme-mediated suppression of γ7 subunit expression has led to a specific attenuation of β-adrenergic receptor signaling in HEK293 cells (14Wang Q. Mullah B. Hansen C. Asundi J. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26040-26048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Moreover,in vitro reconstitution with dimers of differing βγ composition demonstrates that both the β subunit (15McIntire W.E. MacCleery G. Garrison J.C. J. Biol.

We initially interpreted the synergy and βγ selectivity of rhodopsin-catalyzed GTP binding to Gαt to mean that rhodopsin made independent binding contacts with the α and βγ subunits (20Fawzi A.B. Fay D.S. Murphy E.A. Tamir H. Erdos J.J. Northup J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12194-12200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Direct interaction of transducin βγ with rhodopsin has been demonstrated separately with fluorescence spectroscopy (21Phillips W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17032-17039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and with surface plasmon resonance measurements (22Clark W.A. Jian X. Chen L. Northup J.K. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 389-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A receptor contact site on the β subunit was identified in cross-linking studies in which a synthetic peptide derived from the third intracellular loop of the α2A-adrenergic receptor could be cross-linked to the carboxyl-terminal region of the β subunit (23Taylor J.M. Jacob-Mosier G.G. Lawton R.G. VanDort M. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3336-3339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A series of post-translational modifications are required for the functions of G proteins. In the case of Gγ subunits, these modifications include the thioether linkage of an isoprenoid group to the conserved cysteine side chain within a carboxyl-terminal CAAX motif (where C is cysteine, A is an aliphatic amino acid, and X is any amino acid), proteolytic cleavage of the AAX tripeptide, and methylation of the resulting carboxyl terminus. The terminating residue in the CAAX motif appears to determine the identity of the isoprenoid. G protein subunits γ1, γ8(cone) and γ11 with serine at this position are modified with a 15-carbon farnesyl, whereas the other γ subunits terminating in leucine are modified with a 20-carbon geranylgeranyl. The lipid modification of the γ subunits has been shown to be responsible for attaching G proteins to membranes (24Muntz K.H. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 25Simonds W.F. Butrynski J.E. Gautam N. Unson C.G. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5363-5366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is also ample evidence suggesting the involvement of the prenyl groups in protein-protein interactions (26Myung C.S.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), but no apparent difference in interaction with retinal Gαt. Since these two γ subunits differ in both primary amino acid sequence and isoprenoid modification, we designed this study to examine the quantitative contributions of isoprenoid modification and protein structure to the βγ dimer affinity for rhodopsin. Our data indicate that although the lipid modification is essential for a competent βγ dimer, the type of prenyl group on the γ subunits influences the binding affinity for rhodopsin, but not for Gαt. In addition, the primary structure of the γ subunit provides a major contribution to rhodopsin binding of βγ dimers, with the carboxyl-terminal sequences conferring receptor selectivity. Mutant and chimeric γ cDNA clones were made by PCR amplification. Bovine γ1 and γ2 were the original templates. A recombinant baculovirus encoding γ1-CVIL (31Lindorfer M.A. Sherman N.E. Woodfork K.A.

Plasmids encoding chimeric γ1/γ2 structures as previously reported (32Lee C. Murakami T. Simonds W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8779-8784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) were used as PCR templates for generating the current chimeric γ cDNA constructs, in which all the 3′-reverse primers contained nucleotides encoding CAIL prior to the stop codon. The resulting chimeric γ structures therefore all contain a carboxyl-terminal sequence that is known to direct geranylgeranylation. The PCR products encoding the chimeric γ structures were cloned into the transfer vector pBacPAK8 (CLONTECH) for production of recombinant baculoviruses. Insect cell culture, transfection, plaque purification, and virus amplification were carried out according to the manufacturer’s recommended procedures (CLONTECH). G proteins were isolated from bovine retina and baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells expressing recombinant β1γ dimers. Bovine retinal transducin was isolated from rod outer segment discs prepared by discontinuous gradient sedimentation (33Papermaster D.S. Dreyer W.J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Gαt and β1γ1 were purified using previously published procedures (20Fawzi A.B. Fay D.S. Murphy E.A. Tamir H. Erdos J.J.

Sf9 cell-expressed β1γ dimers were purified as described for β1γ2 (30Wildman D.E. Tamir H. Leberer E. Northup J.K. Dennis M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Sf9 cells were co-infected with β1-encoding and the appropriate γ-encoding baculoviruses at multiplicities of infection of 1 for the β1 virus and 3 for the γ virus. The cells were harvested 60 h after infection; the cells were lysed; and a P2 membrane fraction was isolated. All the dimers were purified from Sf9 cell membranes, except β1γ2-A, which was purified from the cytosolic fraction. After sequential chromatography over DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and Ultrogel AcA44 (IBF), the fractions containing the β1γ dimers were pooled and concentrated and then further purified on a Superdex HR-75 FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with the final storage solution (10 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 8 mm CHAPS). Two of the samples, β1γ221 and β1γ2-A, required an additional step of purification through a Mono-Q FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) before the final Superdex HR-75 FPLC size-exclusion chromatography. Pre-cast Tricine-16% acrylamide gels (Novex) were run according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Samples were electrophoresed at 125 V for ∼90 min at room temperature. Protein bands were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry was performed by directly coupling a Shimadzu LC10VP HPLC system to the electrospray ion source of an LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer. Reversed-phase HPLC was performed at a flow rate of 10 μl/min using a 0.3 × 100-mm Betabasic 4 column (Keystone Scientific Inc., Bellefonte, PA). Solution A was H2O/acetonitrile (19:1) and 0.1% formic acid; Solution B was acetonitrile/1-propanol (4:1) and 0.1% formic acid. The column was equilibrated at 80% Solution A and 20% Solution B, and the chromatograph was developed using a linear gradient to 20% Solution A and 80% Solution B in 20 min. Full scan mass spectra over the m/z 300–2000 range were acquired continuously for the duration of the chromatography. βγ dimers were prepared for mass spectrometry by acetone precipitation. Samples (60–201 pmol in 20 μl) in 8 mmCHAPS were mixed with 9 volumes of ice-cold acetone in a Vortex mixer and incubated for 20 min on ice, and precipitates were collected by sedimentation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. After aspirating the supernatant liquid, pellets were allowed to air-dry and then were suspended in 25 μl of Solution A, and 5 μl of the sample was injected for liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. Gαtconcentration was determined by rhodopsin-catalyzed GTPγS binding (20Fawzi A.B. Fay D.S. Murphy E.A. Tamir H. Erdos J.J. Northup J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12194-12200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gβ1γ1 was determined by the Amido Black binding assay (36Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The protein concentrations of all other β1γ dimers were determined from the staining intensity of the β chain calibrated with different amounts of β1γ1 on a Coomassie Blue-stained gel by densitometry, with all the samples and β1γ1 standards within linear range. The activities of the β1γ dimers were quantified by rhodopsin-catalyzed GTPγS binding to Gαt and pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gαt as described previously (20Fawzi A.B. Fay D.S. Murphy E.A. Tamir H. Erdos J.J. Northup J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12194-12200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For both assays, the detergent CHAPS was adjusted to a final concentration of 1.6 mm. Urea-washed rod outer segment disc membranes, the source of rhodopsin, were prepared as described (37Fawzi A.B. Northup J.K. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3804-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Initial rate estimates for the catalyzed GTPγS binding to Gαt and pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gαt were determined by single time point reactions, which consumed <20% of the Gαt substrate. The goal of this study was to delineate the relative contributions of isoprenoid modification and protein structure of the Gγ subunit to the interactions of the βγ dimer with Gα subunits and receptors. We have examined these questions using the retinal G protein and rhodopsin because affinity differences between β1γ1 and β1γ2dimers are well characterized for this receptor, and these two dimers differ in both the primary structure and isoprenoid modification of the γ chain. Data from several laboratories have suggested that the isoprenoid modification provides the major determinant of differences between these two dimers, so we initially tested the effects of altering the prenylation. To examine this question, we tested three mutant γ constructs: the γ1 mutant γ1-CVIL was expected to change γ1 from farnesyl to geranylgeranyl; the γ2 mutant γ2-CVIS was expected to change γ2 from geranylgeranyl to farnesyl; and γ2-A, a truncated form of γ2 that terminates at the cysteine residue of the CAAX motif, was expected to result in a mature protein lacking any prenyl group. Co-infection of Sf9 cells with viruses encoding these mutant γ constructs and a β1-encoding virus resulted in the expression of a β1γ dimer for all constructs. Fig. 1 shows the β1γ dimers resulting from such co-infections purified to near homogeneity and separated on a Tricine gel stained with Coomassie Blue. The electrophoretic mobility differences among the γ chains are noticeable in this gel system. None of the samples contained any detectable Gα contamination measured in the rhodopsin-catalyzed GTPγS exchange assay or pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation assay (data not shown). To confirm the nature of the post-translational modifications, we analyzed purified β1γ dimers using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Fig. 2shows the deconvoluted mass spectra of γ1, γ1-CVIL, γ2, and γ2-CVIS. The observed molecular mass for each of the γ constructs is summarized in Table I. As predicted, the γ1 subunit showed a molecular mass of 8332 Da, in agreement with the calculated molecular mass of the polypeptide chain deduced from the DNA sequence plus all known post-translational modifications. They include removal of the amino-terminal methionine, attachment of a farnesyl group to cysteine 71, removal of the carboxyl-terminal tripeptide, and methylation of the new carboxyl terminus. The γ1-CVIL sequence is predicted to direct geranylgeranyl modification. The observed mass of 8401 Da is consistent with exchange of the farnesyl group of wild-type γ1 for a geranylgeranyl. Consistent with the findings of Lindorfer et al. (31Lindorfer M.A. Sherman N.E. Woodfork K.A. Fletcher J.E. Hunt D.F. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18582-18587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the mass spectra also showed a set of signals corresponding to the fully processed molecule minus the prenyl group. These authors have demonstrated that the loss of the farnesyl group occurs during the ionization process and is not due to heterogeneity of modification. Our data are consistent with their findings since the HPLC elution resolves γ1 chains bearing differing isoprenoid modification prior to the ionization for the mass spectrometry. The γ2 and γ2-CVIS subunits also showed the observed masses consistent with the amino acid composition deduced from the DNA sequence plus the predicted isoprenoid modifications (farnesyl for γ2-CVIS and geranylgeranyl for γ2), endoproteolysis, carboxyl methylation, the removal of the amino-terminal methionine, and amino-terminal acetylation. The γ2-A chain showed an observed mass of 7463 Da, consistent with that of the predicted amino acid sequence of γ2 terminating at cysteine of the CAIL carboxyl terminus, lacking prenylation or methylation, with its amino-terminal methionine removed and the new amino terminus acetylated. Minor amounts of inappropriately prenylated species were observed for the γ2 products (Fig. 2, C and D). The relative abundance of farnesylated versus geranylgeranylated γ subunits is summarized in Table I as well.Table IMolecular masses of γ subunits with altered isoprenylation sequencesCalculated massaThe calculated masses are based upon the amino acid sequence deduced from the DNA sequence plus the expected prenyl modifications (farnesyl for γ1 and γ2-CVIS; geranylgeranyl for γ1-CVIL and γ2), endoproteolysis, carboxyl methylation, removal of the amino-terminal methionine, and amino-terminal acetylation (for γ2, γ2-CVIS, and γ2-A).Observed massFarnesylbFractional isoprenoid modification was calculated from the integrated peaks of the farnesylated and gernylgeranylated species in the deconvoluted mass spectra.GeranylgeranylbFractional isoprenoid modification was calculated from the integrated peaks of the farnesylated and gernylgeranylated species in the deconvoluted mass spectra.%%β1γ183318332100NDcND, not determined.β1γ1-CVIL83998401ND100β1γ2774977501189β1γ2-CVIS768176826634β1γ2-A74637463NDNDa The calculated masses are based upon the amino acid sequence deduced from the DNA sequence plus the expected prenyl modifications (farnesyl for γ1 and γ2-CVIS; geranylgeranyl for γ1-CVIL and γ2), endoproteolysis, carboxyl methylation, removal of the amino-terminal methionine, and amino-terminal acetylation (for γ2, γ2-CVIS, and γ2-A).b Fractional isoprenoid modification was calculated from the integrated peaks of the farnesylated and gernylgeranylated species in the deconvoluted mass spectra.c ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab To assess the effects of altering prenylation of Gγ on βγ interactions with receptors, we tested βγ-dependent, rhodopsin-catalyzed GTPγS binding to Gαt in the presence of different β1γ samples. Fig.3 shows results from one such experiment. The K12 values obtained are summarized in TableII. The β1γ1subunit showed a >12-fold lower affinity compared with the β1γ2 subunit for rhodopsin (K12=227 versus 18 nm). When γ1 prenylation was altered from farnesyl to geranylgeranyl, the affinity of β1γ1-CVIL for rhodopsin increased almost 3-fold (Fig. 3 A), but still did not equal that of β1γ2 for rhodopsin (K12=78 versus versus 18 nm). When γ2 prenylation was altered from geranylgeranyl to farnesyl, the affinity of β1γ2-CVIS for rhodopsin decreased <2-fold (Fig. 3 B), distinct from the lower affinity of β1γ1 for rhodopsin (K12=31 versus 227 nm). However, although the alteration of γ2 prenylation from geranylgeranyl to farnesyl diminished affinity for rhodopsin only modestly, the absence of a prenyl group diminished the interaction of the β1γ2-A dimer to undetectable levels, with no enhancement of GTPγS binding at all (Fig. 3 A). These data suggest an absolute requirement for the isoprenoid modification of the γ subunit for the βγ interaction with receptors.Table IIActivity assessment of β1γ dimers with altered isoprenylationK ½β1γ2β1γ2-CVISβ1γ2-Aβ1γ1β1γ1-CVILnmGαtaffinityaMean ± S.E. for (n) determinations.bThis was determined by saturation of pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gαt.25 ± 2 (4)28 ± 3 (4)≥90029 ± 4 (4)27 ± 2 (4)Rhodopsin affinitycThis was determined by saturation of rhodopsin-catalyzed GTPγS binding to Gαt.18 ± 1.5 (5)31 ± 2 (5)NDdND, not determined.227 ± 12 (5)78 ± 3 (5)a Mean ± S.E. for (n) determinations.b This was determined by saturation of pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gαt.c This was determined by saturation of rhodopsin-catalyzed GTPγS binding to Gαt.d ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab To determine whether the differences in affinity observed among βγ subunit forms were due to differing affinities for interaction with Gαt, we analyzed the βγ dependence of pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gαt. Fig.4 shows the saturation of ADP-ribosylation of Gαt by increasing concentrations of different forms of β1γ dimers. In contrast with the rhodopsin-catalyzed GTPγS binding to Gαt, the pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gαtdisplayed no distinction between β1γ1 and β1γ2 with either form of prenylation (TableII). The non-prenylated γ2 dimer (β1γ2-A) displayed a measurable enhancement of the ADP-ribosylation of Gαt, but with an affinity for Gαt that was >30-fold lower than that for the prenylated β1γ1 or β1γ2 dimer. These data suggest that for the βγ interaction with the Gα subunit, the isoprenoid modification of the γ subunit, not the exact identity of the prenyl group, is important. Since the difference in prenyl group did not account for the majority of the affinity difference between β1γ1 and β1γ2 for rhodopsin, we investigated the contribution of primary structures. Fig.5 depicts the set of chimeras we employed containing heterologous sequence at approximately one-third intervals based upon regions of sequence identity between the γ1and γ2 proteins. These constructs were based upon the previously published chimeras (32Lee C. Murakami T. Simonds W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8779-8784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), except that all of the chimeric constructs were altered to code for CAIL at the carboxyl terminus so that they would all have the same geranylgeranyl modification. Co-infection of Sf9 cells with baculoviruses encoding these chimeric γ chains and a β1-encoding virus led to the expression of β1γ dimers for all constructs. Because the yields of β1γ111 protein were quite low, we used the β1γ1-CVIL product for this protein structure. β1γ222 is the wild-type β1γ2 construct. Fig.6 shows the β1γ chimeras along with the parent structure β1γ1-CVIL and β1γ2 purified to near homogeneity and separated on a Tricine-16% acrylamide gel stained with Coomassie Blue. As found for the prenylation mutant γ chains, this gel system clearly resolves the chimeric γ chains. HPLC electrospray ionization mass spectrometry confirmed that the isoprenoid modification of the γ chains was predominantly the geranylgeranyl directed by the CAIL sequence. Geranylgeranyl-modified chain accounted for >74% of the mass of each purified γ subunit (TableIII).Figure 6SDS-PAGE of purified Gβ1γ subunits with chimeric γ chains.Purified recombinant βγ subunits of defined subtypes were electrophoresed on a Tricine-16% acrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Blue.

https://openalex.org/W1530609286,"Abstract The glycosylation of integrins and other cell surface receptors is altered in many transformed cells. Notably, an increase in the number of β1,6-branched N-linked oligosaccharides correlates strongly with invasive growth of cells. An ectopic expression of the Golgi enzymeN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GlcNAc-TV), which forms β1,6 linkages, promotes metastasis of a number of cell types. It is shown here that the 16-kDa transmembrane subunit (16K) of vacuolar H+-ATPase suppresses β1,6 branching of β1integrin and the epidermal growth factor receptor. Overexpression of 16K inhibits cell adhesion and invasion. 16K contains four hydrophobic membrane-spanning α-helices, and its ability to influence glycosylation is localized primarily within the second and fourth membrane-spanning α-helices. 16K also interacts directly with the transmembrane domain of β1 integrin, but its effects on glycosylation were independent of its binding to β1integrin. These data link cell surface tumor-related glycosylation to a component of the enzyme responsible for acidification of the exocytic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1539899672,"The kinetics for electron transfer have been measured for samples of hemoglobin valency hybrids with initially one type of subunit, α or β, in the oxidized state. Incubation of these samples under anaerobic conditions tends to randomize the type of subunit that is oxidized. With a time coefficient of a few hours at pH 7, 25 °C, the Hb solution (0.1 mm heme) approaches a form with about 60% of β chains reduced, indicating a faster transfer rate in the direction α to β. There was no observable electron transfer for samples saturated with oxygen. The electron transfer occurs predominantly between deoxy and aquo-met subunits, both high spin species.

Incubation of oxidized cross-linked tetramer Hb A with deoxy Hb S also displayed electron transfer, implying a mechanism via inter-tetramer collisions. A dependence on the overall Hb concentration confirms this mechanism, although a small contribution of transfer between subunits of the same tetramer cannot be ruled out. These results suggest that in vivo collisions between the Hb tetramers will be involved in the relative distribution of the methemoglobin between subunits in association with the reductase system present in the erythrocyte.

In heme proteins such as Hb, the oxidation state will determine the ligands that bind to the iron of the active center heme; O2, CO, and NO bind to the ferrous form, whereas water, OH−, or CN− are ligands of the ferric state. Free heme in solution oxidizes on contact with oxygen, whereas the globin offers the possibility of reversible oxygen binding by prolonging the ferrous lifetime to more than 1 day. This is still low compared with the turnover of red blood cells of about 120 days, and reversal to the reduced state requires metHb1 reductase. Although heme proteins can be generally classed as the electron transfer cytochromes and oxygen transporters (hemoglobin (Hb), myoglobin), the latter group obviously also participates in electron transfer reactions as part of their natural function. One of the great paradoxes of aerobic life is that although O2 is essential for respiration, it also drives oxidation reactions, in particular that of the ferrous iron into its ferric form, giving rise to other oxidant species (O˙¯2, H2O2, ROO⋅, OH⋅). These free radicals, produced through the hemoglobin oxidation pathway, are linked to oxidative damage reactions (1Rifkind J.M. Zhang L. Levy A. Manoharan P.T. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1991; 2: 645-652Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 2Nagababu E. Rifkind J.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12503-12511Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) such as the accumulation of heme degradation products in the membrane, which might accelerate the erythrocyte aging. Fortunately reducing systems inside the erythrocyte such as the NADH metHb reductase/cytochromeb 5 along with glutathione and ascorbic acid counterbalance the continuous in vivo autoxidation of hemoglobin, whereas catalase and superoxide dismutase, to cite the most familiar, participate in the elimination of the free radicals. If the oxygen binding properties and the autoxidation mechanism of hemoglobin are well described in the literature, the electron transfer reactions in hemoglobin intra- or inter-tetramers have not been extensively studied. In fact more is known about the electron transfer between Hb and other oxidant or reductant molecules. Furthermore, valency exchange in hemoglobin was often attributed to heme exchange between subunits; indeed, heme loss is relatively rapid for the oxidized or degraded form of hemoglobin. However, reduction of Hb by electron transfer is a natural process, and transfer between the subunits should also occur, although possibly on a much slower time scale. Electron transfer in hemoglobin and its redox-associated reactions are then linked to its in vivo life span. In the present work we study electron transfer reactions between hemoglobin molecules for a better understanding of this mechanism and the overall hemoglobin redox reactions that keep the oxygen carrier active in its ferrous form. We used simple methodologies to discriminate the bi-directional transfers α → β and β → α and intra versus inter-tetramer. Our results are discussed in light of Hb oxidation and reduction differences between the α and β subunit. Hb A was purified from the blood of healthy non-smoking donors, stripped of organophosphates, and stored under liquid nitrogen until use as described previously (3Kister J. Poyart C. Edelstein S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12085-12091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hb S from homozygous sickle cell patients was purified on a DEAE-Sephadex column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.3, after running a pH gradient 8.3 to 8.0. Natural variant Hb Chesapeake α92 Arg → Leu was found in a polyglobulic patient (4Granel B. Serratrice J. Badens C. Lena-Russo D. Disdier P. Weiller P.J. Haematologica. 2001; 1: 105Google Scholar) and characterized by electrophoresis and molecular biology studies (DNA sequence analysis). The separation was accomplished by preparative isoelectric focalization as described below. MetHb was generated by autoxidation of ferrous Hb at 37 °C overnight at pH 6.5 in 50 mm bis-Tris buffer with 100 mmNaCl. The remaining ferrous fraction was oxidized by a small excess of potassium ferricyanide at room temperature. The residual ferricyanide and its reduced form were removed by chromatography on an analytical grade ion exchange resin 501-X8 (Bio-Rad). Human α and β chains were split from Hb A upon reaction with p- mercuribenzoate after the procedure of Winterhalter and Colosimo (5Winterhalter K.H. Colosimo A. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 621-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Then para-mercuribenzoate chains were separated by preparative isoelectric focusing at 5 °C using granulated gel (Ultrodex) and ampholines (with a pH gradient from 6 to 8; No. 80-1125-93) purchased from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. The SH groups were regenerated by incubation with dithiothreitol according to the method developed by Parkhurst and Parkhurst (6Parkhurst K.M. Parkhurst L.J. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because the UV spectra are a sensitive probe of the presence ofpara-mercuribenzoate bound to the cysteines, the αSH and βSH spectra were recorded to assess the absence of residualpara-mercuribenzoate. Analytical isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide PAGE along a gradient from pH 6.5 to 8.5 was run to confirm the homogeneity of each preparations and their correct pI, which are different from those of para-mercuribenzoate-bound chains (this control was also performed for all the other protein preparations). Finally visible spectra of the carboxylated chains did not show a contamination of oxidized heme. Cross-linked DCL Hb was generously provided by Baxter Healthcare Corporation. High performance liquid gel filtration chromatography on Superose 12 PC (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) showed an elution profile for a homogenous population of tetramer under conditions (micromolar concentration) for which oxy-Hb A shows a significant amount of dimers. The symmetric hybrids (α+βO2)2 and (αO2β+)2 were prepared according to the method of Cassoly (7Cassoly R. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 106-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The respective deoxy ferrous subunits were oxidized for several minutes in a 1 m glycine buffer, pH 8.4, by a slight excess of ferricyanide at 4 °C and immediately loaded onto a G25 column to strip the oxidant products. Then a 10% excess of the carboxylated heterologous subunits was added to the stripped oxidized subunits. The hybrid solution was cleared of small contamination of fully metHb and carboxylated Hb A by preparative isoelectric focusing at 5 °C. The spectrum of each hybrid was analyzed by simulating the spectrum as a linear combination of the fully CO and aquo-metHb spectra. As expected, near equal amounts of both heme contributions were observed (to within 3%). Two alternative methods were used that do not require separation of the chains, as reported by Tomoda and Yoneyama (8Tomoda A. Yoneyama Y. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 110: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Hybrid (α+βO2)2 was obtained from metHb based on the preferential reduction of the β subunit by sodium ascorbate under anaerobic conditions. The metHb solution equilibrated with 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, was thoroughly deoxygenated by replacing air with nitrogen gas. Then 20 mmsodium ascorbate was added, and the reduction reaction was monitored by spectrophotometry. Once 45% of the reduction was achieved, the sample was immediately loaded onto a G25 column to remove the ascorbate, thus stopping the reaction. After elution, preparative isoelectric focusing at 5 °C was performed overnight to remove the remaining metHb and also a small amount of fully reduced tetramer. Finally the intermediate isoelectric band enriched in hybrid (α+βO2)2 was further purified by fast protein liquid chromatography cation exchange chromatography using a Source 15 S column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated with 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8. The elution was initiated by a linear pH gradient pH 6.8 to 7.5, and the main peak, which contained the Hb valency hybrid, was collected. Note that the reduction of metHb by ascorbate under CO gas gives the same yield for the preparation of this hybrid. Hybrid (αO2β+)2 was prepared by oxidation of Hb A with potassium ferricyanide under anaerobic conditions taking advantage of the preferential oxidation of the deoxy-β subunits. An amount of potassium ferricyanide corresponding to 40% of the Hb was added to the Hb A solution and equilibrated a few minutes in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl at pH 8.4. The oxidant was removed by the same procedure as that for metHb described above, and the hybrid (αO2β+)2 was further purified following the two steps of purification used for the other valency hybrid. The anaerobic conditions were ensured by coupling several physical and chemical methods. The first step consisted in the deoxygenation overnight of the vial containing the chosen buffer with a stream of humidified N2 gas. The vial was sealed with a rubber septum cap covered with vacuum grease. The vial was plunged in a water recipient connected to a thermostatted bath. The pure N2 was delivered after passage through a bubbler containing only water followed by a second sealed bubbler containing 0.2n NaOH and 0.2% sodium dithionite. The gas tubing contained cotton stoppers to prevent any contamination of the vial from the bubbler solutions. The oxygen removal from the buffer was facilitated by magnetic stirring. All the protein and enzymes solution were deoxygenated before incubation by the same purging system for 30 min on ice with continuous stirring. Then the Hb solution was first introduced in the incubation vial with a Hamilton syringe previously flushed with N2, and the Hb deoxygenation was achieved in 15 min with stirring. In the case of a mixture between ferrous and ferric species, the latter was added after the ferrous sample was deoxygenated, and the mixture was then further deoxygenated for few minutes. Finally to maintain the anaerobic conditions for a long period we used an enzymatic system; the substrate and its enzyme were added with the Hamilton syringe to scavenge the remaining oxygen. The N2 flow was disconnected 30 min after the mixing of Hb and the enzyme solutions, and the stirring was stopped to slow down the gas phase diffusion into the solution. To monitor the electron transfer reaction, aliquots were taken through the rubber cap with a Hamilton syringe thoroughly flushed with N2 and immediately diluted into a quench solution equilibrated with CO and kept on ice. Indeed the CO binding to the ferrous fraction prevented any further reaction of electron transfer from the ferrous to the ferric hemes. Except for the azide binding kinetics described below, we also added cyanide at a concentration of 500 μm to the quench solution to prevent the electron acceptance by the ferric hemes. We used the enzymatic system from Pseudomonas species (Sigma), protocatechuic acid (0.5 mm), protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (0.2 units/ml) described by Bull and Ballou (9Bull C. Ballou D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12673-12680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to ensure Hb mixtures at very low O2 concentrations. This biological O2 scavenger system was very efficient, requiring only a few minutes to deoxygenate a 20 μm Hb solution equilibrated under air atmosphere. In our experiments the enzyme system was added after a careful deoxygenation of the buffer and the ferrous Hb solution by a continuous flushing under N2gas so that the remaining O2 concentration did not exceed a few micromolar. We did not observe any participation of the enzymatic system in the electron transfer between Hb subunits. Control experiments were performed in the absence of enzyme for a period of 10 h after great efforts to eliminate the soluble O2by gas flushing, and we observed similar rates of electron transfer as those in the presence of enzyme. Furthermore, in all our control experiments no reduction of the ferric fraction was measured after 24 h of incubation. This was not the case for the glucose/glucose oxidase/catalase system (10Englander S.W. Calhoun D.B. Englander J.J. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We observed 4% reduction of a metHb solution at 300 μm heme concentration (without cyanide) in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 25 °C after 24 h. Absorption spectra were recorded with a SLM-Aminco DW2000 spectrophotometer to monitor the overall fraction of metHb. Indeed methemoglobin formation is the most critical problem we had to overcome because remaining traces of oxygen or addition during sampling via the Hamilton syringe might provoke this oxidation side reaction. Samples were monitored during the 24-h incubation under anaerobic conditions, and the spectrum of each aliquot was analyzed. In the presence of the O2-scavenging system, deoxy Hb samples did not show the formation of metHb after 24 h of incubation. For the hybrid species, methemoglobin formation did not exceed 3% after 24 h and did not introduce a systematic error in the electron transfer measurement because the autoxidation rates for α and β chains are equivalent. The kinetics of metHb reduction were recorded with the rapid-scanning diode array spectrophotometer HP8453. We measured the reduction of metHb, (α+βO2)2, and (αO2β+)2 hybrid species by the system NADPH/ferredoxin-NADP/ferrodoxin as described by Hayashiet al. (11Hayashi A. Suzuki T. Shin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 310: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Enzymes and chemicals were from Sigma. We also measured the chemical reduction of these species by 20 mmsodium ascorbate. Absorption differences between heterologous subunits have been reported in the ferrous deoxy and high spin ferric states (12Mawatari K. Matsukawa S. Yoneyama Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 748: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We used these small differences of optical properties to monitor the electron transfer between Hb subunits. These inequivalences of optical properties between Hb chains arise essentially from their aquo-metHb forms. Such differences have been observed for high spin ferric heme-ligand complexes but not for low spin ligands such as azide or cyanide for instance (12Mawatari K. Matsukawa S. Yoneyama Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 748: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This could be related to the difference between the chains in their pK a for the transition between the high spin aquo-metHb and the low spin hydroxy-metHb forms. Biphasic kinetics of azide association to aquo-metHb were observed, with rates of 600 and 140m−1 s−1 at 25 °C, 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7. From the work of Gibsonet al. (13Gibson Q.H. Parkhurst L.J. Geraci G. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4668-4676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the faster rate was attributed to the β subunits; these rate assignments were confirmed by kinetic measurements of the hybrid species, fully α- or β-oxidized (Fig.1 A). In the presence of IHP, the ratio of the rates is 30 +/− 5 for metHb A, as previously observed by Edelstein and Gibson (14Edelstein S.J. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 961-965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the ratio was 40 +/− 5 for met-DCL Hb with IHP. The larger ratio in the presence of IHP was due essentially to the β chain contribution (Fig. 1 B). Indeed the slow rate of azide binding to the α subunits is similar for metHb A, met-DCL Hb, and (α+βCO)2 valency hybrids with or without the allosteric effector. We used this large difference in rates to monitor the relative changes between α and β ferric fractions during the electron transfer reactions (insert Fig. 1 A). Kinetics were recorded at 403 nm, a wavelength for which the maximum change of absorbance occurred between aquo-metHb and azido-metHb forms. The estimation of the α and β ferric fractions depended on the accurate measurements of the total signal amplitude and the proportion of the two binding phases. As shown in the inset of Fig. 1 B, the expected amplitude from the static spectrum is in agreement with the measured amplitude by stopped-flow after mixing a metHb solution with a final concentration of 15 mm azide in the presence or absence of IHP. Each stopped-flow kinetic curve was an average of at least five stopped-flow mixings. Note that for metHb A, the amplitudes of the two phases are not identical, due to spectral differences of the chains (inset of Fig. 1 A). At the different wavelengths tested, the percentage of fast phase is shown between 40 and 55%; in particular, at 403 nm, the fast phase is equal to 42 +/−2% of the signal but lower after the addition of 0.2 mm IHP (Fig.1 B). This was taken into account to relate the proportions of the two azide binding phases to the ferric α and β fractions. The normalized kinetics were analyzed as a sum of two exponential terms. For each experiment, a control of azide association to metHb was performed to constrain the two binding rates for the data simulation, so only the phase amplitudes were allowed to change. Data simulations were carried out using the least squares fitting program of Scientist. We measured the electron transfer in hemoglobin by incubation of metHb A or met-DCL Hb with deoxy-Hb S; these species were easily separated by biochemical methods, since their pI values differ by 0.4 pH units. Use of the cross-linked DCL Hb ensured that dimer exchange will not occur. Dimer exchange was initially minimal when one of the species was the deoxy tetramer, which required hours to dissociate as opposed to a few seconds for liganded Hb. Thus, for the mixing of metHb A and deoxy-Hb S, as the electron transfer reaction proceeded, the partially oxidized Hb S may dissociate into dimers and hybridize with the Hb A dimers. There was little difference in the electron transfer kinetics for Hb Aversus DCL Hb for experiments at the same hemoglobin concentrations. Each aliquot collected during the incubation under anaerobic conditions of the Hb mixtures was diluted in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, containing 500 μm KCN and equilibrated under 1 atm of CO gas to prevent the autoxidation of the ferrous heme, further electron transfer reaction, and to neutralize the difference of charge between ferric and ferrous hemes before separation of the Hb species by a fast protein liquid chromatography cation exchange chromatography (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The aliquot was loaded onto a Mono S high resolution column, and the separation was carried out by a ionic strength gradient 0 → 100 mm NaCl. Once the separation of the two Hb species was achieved, their absorption spectra were analyzed as a linear combination of the fully HbFe(II)CO and HbFe(III)CN− spectra, considering the α and β chains as equivalent since the (α+CNβCO)2 and (αCOβ+CN)2 spectra are very similar and are well simulated from the fully carboxylated and cyano-met spectra. CO bimolecular recombination rates were measured after flash photolysis with a 10-ns Yttrium-Aluminum Garnet laser pulse delivering 160 mJ at 532 nm (Quantel). Samples were equilibrated under 0.1 atm of CO in 1-mm optical cuvettes. A typical kinetic curve with a detection wavelength at 436 nm is the average of at least 10 measurements. This technique was used to compare the allosteric properties for ligand binding between Hb Chesapeake and Hb A at pH 7.2. Sodium dithionite solution was added up to a final concentration of 0.5 mm in the experiments to prevent an O2 contamination and to keep the Hb samples fully reduced. Kinetics of electron transfer between the Hb subunits are shown in Figs. 2 A and B. When a symmetric hybrid (α or β oxidized) is incubated under anaerobic conditions, the fraction of oxidized form tends to become more evenly distributed, with a slightly larger amount of α chain in the oxidized form at equilibrium. At pH 7.0, 25 °C, and 100 μm heme concentration, the observed rates are 0.2 h−1 for the reaction starting with (α+βdeoxy)2 or (αdeoxyβ+)2; however, the latter species showed about a 20% slightly faster phase. At equilibrium the ferrous heme fraction was slightly more populated in β subunits, which indicates that the microscopic rate of electron transfer is faster in the direction α → β+ than β → α+, with the observed rate the sum of the microscopic rates. The ratio between β and α ferrous fractions at equilibrium, equivalent to the ratio between the microscopic rates, is 1.7 and 1.3 with or without the effector IHP. Each point in the curve (Figs. 2) is the fraction of α- and β-oxidized subunits, determined from the azide binding kinetics. As described under “Materials and Methods,” oxidized α and β subunits react with azide (13Gibson Q.H. Parkhurst L.J. Geraci G. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4668-4676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at distinct rates, with β much faster than α chains. Fig. 3 illustrates the variation of azide binding kinetics due to electron transfer under anaerobic conditions after incubation of the symmetric valency hybrid (α+βdeoxy)2. The fraction of the fast rebinding phase increases as the β chains transfer their electron to the α-oxidized subunits. Likewise, for experimental conditions closer to those in vivo, namely pH 7.4, 37 °C with 100 mm phosphate to mimic the 2,3-diphosphoglycerate effect, the same pattern was observed for the electron transfer reaction in hemoglobin (0.1 mmtotal heme) with a ratio α+/β+ at equilibrium equal to 1.3 and observed rates of 0.4 h−1 for the 2 hybrid species. Again the (α-deoxy-β+)2 hybrid species showed an initial phase (∼20%) with a faster rate; the kinetics could be fitted with two exponential terms, with 80% having the slower rate, similar to the other valency hybrid. This might suggest a different pathway or the possibility of more than two distinct species with regard to their electron transfer reactivity arising from the 10 different Hb ligation micro-states. We also used the small differences of the absorption spectra of the hybrids to monitor the electron transfer kinetics at 37 °C, pH 7.4 (Fig. 4). Using this method we obtained transition rates for β-oxidized and α-oxidized hybrids equal to 0.5 and 0.4 h−1, respectively, at 20 μm protein on a heme basis. The final distribution of the oxidized sites was confirmed by the relative amplitudes of fast and slow phases in azide binding kinetics. Note that with this method of detection we did not observe the biphasic kinetics for the (α-deoxy-β+)2 hybrid. However, in these experiments part of a rapid phase could be missed because the time required to deoxygenate the solution in the optical cuvette with the enzymatic system is about 5 min; in the other method (with azide kinetics on aliquots), the hybrid solutions were readily deoxygenated by adding mechanical stirring to the enzyme system action. We did not observe electron transfer between Hb subunits under 1 atm of O2 or CO at 25 °C after a 48-h incubation (data not shown), confirming a very low rate for liganded ferrous subunits. Similarly, the addition of CN− as the ligand for the oxidized subunits greatly decreased the transfer rate (15Shibayama N. Morimoto H. Saigo S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4375-4381Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 16Shibayama N. Morimoto H. Saigo S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6221-6228Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In a similar manner, at alkaline pH the electron transfer decreases when the oxidized subunits exhibit a transition of ligand from water molecules to hydroxyl anions (Fig. 5). Consequently the electron transfer occurs mainly between deoxy and aquo-met subunits for which the heme configuration is in the high spin state. Initially heme exchange was proposed to explain the valency exchange between Hb subunits. Hemin loss from high spin aquo-metHb is possible since hemin dissociation from metHb takes only a few minutes (17Benesch R.E. Kwong S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14881-14885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hargrove M.S. Whitaker T. Olson J.S. Vali R.J. Mathews A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17385-17389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), but ferrous heme dissociation is much slower, and valency exchange involving heme is unlikely to occur in vivo. No heme exchange reaction was demonstrated between ferrous and ferric Hb because of the high affinity of globin for the heme (19Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3282-3287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); such an exchange would involve a concomitant heme dissociation from both types of subunit. Although this might occur under conditions of low protein stability, our experiments were always within the range for which Hb unfolding is not probable. Because free heme is immediately oxidized by O2, any hemes that were exchanged would be oxidized; this would imply an increase in the overall percentage of metHb, which was not observed. To check for a possible heme exchange reaction under anaerobic conditions, we mixed deoxy-Hb with a 2-fold excess of cobaltous porphyrin after the addition of sodium dithionite to scavenge the oxygen. In this experiment heme exchange is favored because cobaltous porphyrin is available in solution. Spectra for each aliquot collected were measured with and without CO. The spectral variation upon CO addition was directly linked to the fraction of hemoglobin ferrous heme replaced by cobaltous porphyrin since only the ferrous heme reacts with CO. The observed rate was estimated to be equal to 0.007 h−1 at pH 8.0, 25 °C, which reflects the slow dissociation rate of the ferrous heme from the globin. A dependence on the allosteric state of Hb was tested by use of IHP, a potent effector that favors the deoxy conformation, and a mutant Hb, which shifts the allosteric equilibrium in the opposite direction. In general Hb with two ligands display a mixture of the two allosteric states and is therefore sensitive to shifts in the allosteric equilibrium. For example, the difference spectra for both valency hybrids measured by Raman spectroscopy showed about half of the difference between deoxy and fully liganded Hb (20Mukerji I. Spiro T.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13132-13139Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We did not observe a change in the rate of electron transfer for samples with IHP; only a slight increase on the inequivalence between bi-directional electron transfer pathways was observed. This result suggests that the Hb quaternary conformation does not significantly influence the electron transfer. Electron transfer kinetics with symmetric hybrids of Hb Chesapeake support this hypothesis. Indeed this natural variant has been described as a high oxygen affinity mutant due to a pronounced destabilization of the deoxy conformation (21Turner G.J. Galacteros F. Doyle M.L. Hedlund B. Pettigrew D.W. Turner B.W. Smith F.R. Moo-Penn W. Rucknagel D.L. Ackers G.K. Proteins. 1992; 14: 333-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 22Gibson Q.H. Nagel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7255-7259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetics of CO rebinding measured by flash photolysis for 50% ligand dissociation show much less slow phase, characteristic of the deoxy species, compared with Hb A (inset in Fig.6). This confirms that the Hb Chesapeake tetramers are strongly shifted toward the liganded conformation. Electron transfer kinetics with Hb Chesapeake valency hybrids exhibit rates similar to those of Hb A (0.15 h−1) at pH 7.0, 25 °C, with the same preferential pathway toward the β subunits (Fig. 6). To test for transfer between tetramers, we mixed a near equal amount of deoxy-Hb S with met-DCL Hb or metHb A. The cross-linked DCL Hb was used to prevent dimers exchange. After incubation, the collected aliquots were loaded onto a strong cation exchange column to separate each component for further analysis of their relative ferrous and ferric content by spectroscopy. Fig. 7 shows the spectral variation upon electron transfer from deoxy Hb A toward the metHb S after 24 h. After separation by chromatography (see the inset in Fig. 7) the Hb spectrum was simulated as a linear combination of fully cyano-metHb and Hb CO spectra, two stable forms preventing any further electron transfer. The dependence of the electron transfer rate on heme concentration is shown in the inset of Fig. 8; electron transfer is faster at higher hemoglobin concentrations, with a value of 1.6 h−1 at 1.2 mm (total heme). This is expected if the electron transfer occurs by collision between tetramers. A deviation from linearity at low protein concentration could indicate that a parallel mechanism is present. Studies of partially liganded Hb are difficult because of their transient nature, especially with oxygen, which dissociates rapidly. There are numerous in vitro studies on hemoglobin that are based on valency hybrids or metal-substituted Hb. These Hb hybrids molecules have been extensively produced as stable analogues for a better understanding of the Hb oxygenation mechanism. However, electron transfer may play a significant role in the redistribution of the valency state between α and β subunits after a prolonged incubation under conditions for which hemes are not fully liganded. In vivo the electron transfer between hemoglobin molecules within the erythrocyte will occur in parallel with the enzymatic reduction and are capable of reducing metHb on the order of a few minutes (23Kuma F. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5518-5523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electron transfer is a well known reaction for both the cytochromes and Hb. In fact Hb is probably reduced more than 50 times during the 120-day lifetime of the cell, since the rate of autoxidation is about 2 days. Thus electron transfer due to collisions between heme proteins is a common reaction, and some transfer between Hb molecules, although at a slower rate, is to be expected. In the present study, an electron transfer reaction on the time scale of a few hours was observed. For the symmetric hybrids, this reaction will tend to more evenly distribute the fraction of each type of subunit that is oxidized. A slight preference for the α-oxidized form was observed, indicating a higher rate for electron transfer from α to β chains. The slight tendency of the β chains to gain an electron from the α chains could be explained by its higher oxidation-reduction potential, 0.11 V compared with 0.05 V (24Banerjee R. Cassoly R. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 42: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However we did not observe an inequivalence in the reduction of the oxidized subunits by the ferrodoxin-NADP system (data not shown), as has been reported for the methemoglobin reductase system in the absence of IHP (25Tomoda A. Yubisui T. Tsuji A. Yoneyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3119-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A factor of 2 at pH 7.4 was found in favor of the β chains with ascorbate (data not shown) as previously described (26Tomoda A. Takeshita M. Yoneyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7415-7419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From these results, one cannot discriminate whether the transfer occurs intra-Hb tetramer from the symmetric Hb hybrids mixture rather by collision via inter-tetramer exchange or from these two different mechanisms. Inter-molecular electron transfer is obviously a mechanism by which numerous oxidation or reduction reactions are supplied such as the reduction of metHb by the cytochrome b 5. From the results of mixing deoxy tetramers with oxidized cross-linked tetramers, the mechanism of transfer via tetramer collisions was confirmed. Based on the concentration dependence study (Fig. 8) we were able to extrapolate the bimolecular rate of transfer under physiological conditions of the erythrocyte, where the Hb concentration is very high (6 mm in tetramers). Taking a venous hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SvO2) about 75% the electron transfer rate between deoxy and ferric subunits would be 6 h−1. The electron transfer rate decreases when the oxygen saturation increases; in an arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SaO2), about 97% the electron transfer rate will then approach a value of 0.7 h−1. Consequently in the venous compartment, electron transfer is likely to redistribute the oxidized fraction between the pool of Hb tetramers concomitantly with the reduction process by the natural enzymatic system. Heme loss depends on the heme oxidation state, with a very high affinity of the order of picomolar for the ferrous state (27Gibson Q.H. Antonini E. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 1384-1388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but greatly decreased for the ferric heme (18Hargrove M.S. Whitaker T. Olson J.S. Vali R.J. Mathews A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17385-17389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). From59Fe-labeled heme studies, heme loss or exchange for the ferrous deoxy or liganded Hb or cyano-met Hb has been shown to require more than 5 days (28Bunn H.F. Jandl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 465-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas hemin may dissociate within a few minutes. The affinity of the heme for the apoglobin is essentially driven by its dissociation rate; association is rapid, and no difference was observed between heme and heme-CO binding rates to apoglobin (19Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3282-3287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hemin dissociation increases 10-fold for dimers compared with tetramers (17Benesch R.E. Kwong S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14881-14885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), attributed mainly to a significant increase of the rate of dissociation of hemin from the β chains (19Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3282-3287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,28Bunn H.F. Jandl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 465-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore an increase in hemoglobin oxidation, especially for the β chains, or an increase in hemoglobin dimerization will invariably accelerate the hemoglobin degradation in vivo, ending with the precipitation of the apoglobin. For a normal red cell the reduction system is sufficient to ensure a very low level of methemoglobin. However, if the methemoglobin fraction increases due to a decrease of the activity of the NADH-cytochromeb 5 reductase or to a decrease of the substrate concentrations including the cytochrome b 5 such as in case of red cell senescence or methemoglobinemia, the role of the electron transfer between hemoglobin molecules with a higher rate for transfer from α to β could help prevent an accumulation of the unstable oxidized β chains. The same mechanism could be involved in the erythrocyte disorders observed for thalassemia and hemolytic anemia due, respectively, to unpaired chains or unstable hemoglobin variants. The presence of a rapidly oxidizing form would drain electrons from the normal fraction. In these diseases unstable species are highly susceptible to autoxidation, forming aggregates and inclusion bodies. This autocatalytic degradation after oxidation and removal of these forms is necessary to avoid further electron transfer with the remaining fraction. Electron transfer in hemoglobin will play a rolein vivo during the transit of the red cells, since it will effect the distribution of oxidized subunits. We thank G. Caron for preparing hemoglobin samples and Professor D. Lena-Russo for the generous gift of Chesapeake Hb fresh whole blood."
