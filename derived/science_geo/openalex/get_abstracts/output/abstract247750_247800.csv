https://openalex.org/W2065118621,"In order to gain insight into sensory processing modulating reproductive behavioral and endocrine changes, we have aimed at identifying afferent pathways to neurons synthesizing luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH, also known as gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH]), a key neurohormone of reproduction. Injection of conditional pseudorabies virus into the brain of an LHRH::CRE mouse line led to the identification of neuronal networks connected to LHRH neurons. Remarkably, and in contrast to established notions on the nature of LHRH neuronal inputs, our data identify major olfactory projection pathways originating from a discrete population of olfactory sensory neurons but fail to document any synaptic connectivity with the vomeronasal system. Accordingly, chemosensory modulation of LHRH neuronal activity and mating behavior are dramatically impaired in absence of olfactory function, while they appear unaffected in mouse mutants lacking vomeronasal signaling. Further visualization of afferents to LHRH neurons across the brain offers a unique opportunity to uncover complex polysynaptic circuits modulating reproduction and fertility."
https://openalex.org/W2039254286,"Pheromones can have profound effects on reproductive physiology and behavior in mammals. To investigate the neural circuits underlying these effects, we used a genetic transneuronal tracer to identify neurons that synapse with GnRH (LHRH) neurons, the key regulators of reproduction. We then asked whether the connected neurons are presynaptic or postsynaptic to GnRH neurons and analyzed their responses to chemosensory cues. Surprisingly, these experiments indicate that GnRH neurons receive pheromone signals from both odor and pheromone relays in the brain and may also receive common odor signals. Moreover, feedback loops are evident whereby GnRH neurons could influence both odor and pheromone processing. Remarkably, approximately 800 GnRH neurons communicate with approximately 50,000 neurons in 53 functionally diverse brain areas, with some connections exhibiting sexual dimorphism. These studies reveal a complex interplay between reproduction and other functions in which GnRH neurons appear to integrate information from multiple sources and modulate a variety of brain functions."
https://openalex.org/W2079081359,"Secreted and membrane proteins are translocated across or into cell membranes through a protein-conducting channel (PCC). Here we present a cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of the Escherichia coli PCC, SecYEG, complexed with the ribosome and a nascent chain containing a signal anchor. This reconstruction shows a messenger RNA, three transfer RNAs, the nascent chain, and detailed features of both a translocating PCC and a second, non-translocating PCC bound to mRNA hairpins. The translocating PCC forms connections with ribosomal RNA hairpins on two sides and ribosomal proteins at the back, leaving a frontal opening. Normal mode-based flexible fitting of the archaeal SecYEbeta structure into the PCC electron microscopy densities favours a front-to-front arrangement of two SecYEG complexes in the PCC, and supports channel formation by the opening of two linked SecY halves during polypeptide translocation. On the basis of our observation in the translocating PCC of two segregated pores with different degrees of access to bulk lipid, we propose a model for co-translational protein translocation."
https://openalex.org/W2003049757,"AKT/protein kinase B (PKB) is a cardinal node in diverse signaling cascades important in both normal cellular physiology and various disease states. AKT signaling regulates cell proliferation and survival, cell growth (size), glucose metabolism, cell motility and angiogenesis. Aberrant regulation of these processes result in cellular perturbations considered hallmarks of cancer, and numerous studies testify to the frequent hyperactivation of AKT signaling in many human cancers. Various oncoproteins and tumor suppressors intersect the AKT signal transduction pathway and are activated or inactivated, respectively, in cancer. This issue of Oncogene Reviews includes a collection of perspectives on the normal cellular functions of various components of the AKT pathway, as well as biological consequences of alterations of these proteins as related to tumorigenesis. Two reviews focus on AKT regulation, one of which addresses various aspects of phosphoinositide metabolism, while the other emphasizes the role of AKT-interacting proteins in AKT activation. Several reviews highlight the role of major AKT substrates involved in cellular metabolism, transcription and translation; another focuses on the role of AKT signaling in epithelial–mesenchymal transition. Also included are articles on the involvement of AKT pathway deregulation in human cancer and certain hereditary cancer syndromes, as well as in murine models of cancer based on AKT pathway activation. Additional articles discuss current approaches to identify selective inhibitors of the AKT pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2013511756,"The mitochondrial carriers are a family of transport proteins that shuttle metabolites, nucleotides, and cofactors across the inner mitochondrial membrane. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, NAD+ is synthesized outside the mitochondria and must be imported across the permeability barrier of the inner mitochondrial membrane. However, no protein responsible for this transport activity has ever been isolated or identified. In this report, the identification and functional characterization of the mitochondrial NAD+ carrier protein (Ndt1p) is described. The NDT1 gene was overexpressed in bacteria. The purified protein was reconstituted into liposomes, and its transport properties and kinetic parameters were characterized. It transported NAD+ and, to a lesser extent, (d)AMP and (d)GMP but virtually not α-NAD+, NADH, NADP+, or NADPH. Transport was saturable with an apparent Km of 0.38 mm for NAD+. The Ndt1p-GFP was found to be targeted to mitochondria. Consistently with Ndt1p localization and its function as a NAD+ transporter, cells lacking NDT1 had reduced levels of NAD+ and NADH in their mitochondria and reduced activity of mitochondrial NAD+-requiring enzymes. Similar results were also found in the mitochondria of cells lacking NDT2 that encodes a protein (Ndt2p) displaying 70% homology with Ndt1p. The Δndt1 Δndt2 double mutant exhibited lower mitochondrial NAD+ and NADH levels than the single deletants and a more pronounced delay in growth on nonfermentable carbon sources. The main role of Ndt1p and Ndt2p is to import NAD+ into mitochondria by unidirectional transport or by exchange with intramitochondrially generated (d)AMP and (d)GMP.

The main role of Ndt1p and Ndt2p is to import NAD+ into mitochondria by unidirectional transport or by exchange with intramitochondrially generated (d)AMP and (d)GMP. Mitochondria contain in their matrix the universal hydrogen transfer coenzyme NAD+, which serves to transfer hydrogen from substrates to the respiratory chain by oxidative phosphorylation. In addition to its well known role as a coenzyme in redox reactions, NAD+ exerts other important functions in mitochondria. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mitochondrial NADH has been shown to participate in Fe/S protein biogenesis (1Muhlenhoff U. Richhardt N. Gerber J. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29810-29816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and to be the source for NADPH (2Outten C.E. Culotta V.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2015-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), which is required in mitochondria for oxidative stress protection and for specific biogenesis reactions. NAD+ has been shown also to serve critical regulatory functions in gene transcription, enzyme activity, and other important processes through ADP-ribosylation and deacetylation reactions (3Herrero-Yraola A.

In addition, the increase in the NAD+/NADH ratio in mitochondria seems to be important for the extension of the life-span of yeast by calorie restriction (6Lin S.J. Kaeberlein M. Andalis A.A. Sturtz L.A. Defossez P.A. Culotta V.C. Fink G.R. Guarente L. Nature. 2002; 418: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). The enzymes of NAD+ biosynthesis are generally believed to be localized outside the mitochondria (Refs. 7Anderson R.M. Bitterman K.J. Wood J.G. Medvedik O. Cohen H. Lin S.S. Manchester J.K.

Int. 1996; 38: 297-306PubMed Google Scholar), therefore, NAD+ must be imported into these organelles. For a long time nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides were known to be unable to cross the inner membranes of mitochondria (12Tzagoloff A. Mitochondria. Plenum Press, New York1982: 1Google Scholar). However, NAD+ has been shown to be taken up by intact plant mitochondria, the uptake being concentration- and temperature-dependent and specifically inhibited by an azido derivative of NAD+ (13Tobin A. Djedjiour B. Journet E. Neuburger M. Douce R. Plant Physiol. 1980; 66: 225-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Neuburger M. Douce R. Biochem. J. 1983; 216: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Moreover, using human cultured cells harvested under quiescent conditions (6–8 days after medium change), Rustin et al. (15Rustin P. Parfait B. Chretien D. Bourgeron T. Djouadi F. Bastin J. Rotig A. Munnich A. J. Biol.

These studies contradicted the notion of mitochondrial inner membrane impermeability to pyridine coenzymes and led to the hypothesis that NAD+ is transported into mitochondria by a carrier-mediated system. However, the one or more proteins responsible for the observed transport activities have not been hitherto isolated or identified. In this study we provide evidence that the gene products of YIL006W and YEL006W, named Ndt1p and Ndt2p, respectively, are two isoforms of the mitochondrial NAD+ transporter in S. cerevisiae. These proteins are 373 and 335 amino acids long, respectively, possess the characteristics of the MCF, 2The abbreviations used are: MCFmitochondrial carrier familyACDHacetaldehyde dehydrogenaseADHalcohol dehydrogenaseGFPgreen fluorescence proteinNAADdeamido-NADNAMNnicotinic acid mononucleotideNdtnicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) transporterNMNnicotinamide mononucleotidePDHpyruvate dehydrogenasePIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidYPrich mediumSCsynthetic complete mediumSMsynthetic minimal mediumLC-MS/MSliquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. 2The abbreviations used are: MCFmitochondrial carrier familyACDHacetaldehyde dehydrogenaseADHalcohol dehydrogenaseGFPgreen fluorescence proteinNAADdeamido-NADNAMNnicotinic acid mononucleotideNdtnicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) transporterNMNnicotinamide mononucleotidePDHpyruvate dehydrogenasePIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidYPrich mediumSCsynthetic complete mediumSMsynthetic minimal mediumLC-MS/MSliquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. and display a high degree (70%) of homology. Ndt1p was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified, reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles, and identified from its transport properties as a carrier for NAD+. GFP fused to Ndt1p was found to be targeted to mitochondria. Both Δndt1 and Δndt2 cells exhibited lower levels of NAD+ and NADH in their mitochondria and decreased activity of the NAD+-requiring mitochondrial enzymes PDH and ACDH. The Δndt1 Δndt2 double mutant displayed also a severe delay in growth on nonfermentable carbon sources. This is the first time that proteins responsible for the uptake of NAD+ into mitochondria and their genes have been identified at the molecular level. mitochondrial carrier family acetaldehyde dehydrogenase alcohol dehydrogenase green fluorescence protein deamido-NAD nicotinic acid mononucleotide nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) transporter nicotinamide mononucleotide pyruvate dehydrogenase 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid rich medium synthetic complete medium synthetic minimal medium liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. mitochondrial carrier family acetaldehyde dehydrogenase alcohol dehydrogenase green fluorescence protein deamido-NAD nicotinic acid mononucleotide nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) transporter nicotinamide mononucleotide pyruvate dehydrogenase 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid rich medium synthetic complete medium synthetic minimal medium liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Sequence Search and Analysis—Databases were screened with the sequence of Ndt1p (encoded by YIL006W) with BLASTP and TBLASTN. The amino acid sequences were aligned with ClustalW (version 1.7). The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method (16Saitu N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar), MacVector 7.2 software (Accelrys, Cambridge, UK), and PAM250 matrix. Yeast Strains, Media, and Preparation of Mitochondria—BY4742 (wild-type), Δndt1 and Δndt2 yeast strains were provided by the EUROFAN resource center EUROSCARF (Frankfurt, Germany). The NDT1 (YIL006W) or NDT2 (YEL006W) locus of the S. cerevisiae strain BY4742 (MATα;his3Δ1;leu2Δ0;lys2Δ0;ura3Δ0) was replaced by kanMX4. The double deletion strain Δndt1 Δndt2 was constructed using the PCR-mediated gene disruption technique by replacing the YEL006W open reading frame with the hygromycin B resistance cassette (hphMX3) in the Δndt1 mutant (17Goldstein A.L. McCusker J.H. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1541-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). All deletions were verified by PCR. The wild-type and deletion strains were grown in rich medium (YP) containing 2% bactopeptone and 1% yeast extract, synthetic complete medium (SC), or synthetic minimal medium (SM) (18Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar). All media were supplemented with a fermentable or a nonfermentable carbon source (2% glucose, 2% ethanol, 3% acetate, 2% dl-lactate, or 2% pyruvate) and with auxotrophic nutrients when required. The final pH was adjusted to 4.5 or, with acetate or pyruvate, to 6.5. Mitochondria and spheroplasts were isolated from cells grown in ethanol-supplemented YP until the early exponential phase (optical density between 1.0 and 1.5) was reached. The mitochondria were further purified on a discontinuous gradient (19Meisinger C. Sommer T. Pfanner N. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Construction of Expression Plasmids—The coding sequence of NDT1 (YIL006W) or NDT2 (YEL006W) was cloned into the pMW7 vector for expression in E. coli. Both open reading frames were amplified from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA by PCR using primers corresponding to the extremities of the coding sequences with additional BamHI and HindIII sites for NDT1 and NdeI and HindIII sites for NDT2. The pRS416-NDT1 and pRS416-NDT2 plasmids were constructed by cloning a DNA fragment consisting of the NDT1 or NDT2 open reading frame, of 450-bp upstream and 250-bp downstream of the open reading frame into the low copy centromeric vector pRS416 (20Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The latter DNA fragments were amplified from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA by PCR using primers with additional BamHI and XhoI sites. Transformants of E. coli DH5α cells were selected on ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and screened by direct colony PCR and by restriction digestion of purified plasmids. The sequences of the inserts were verified. Bacterial Expression and Purification of Ndt1p and Ndt2p—The overproduction of Ndt1p or Ndt2p as inclusion bodies in the cytosol of E. coli was accomplished as previously described (21Fiermonte G. Walker J.E. Palmieri F. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), except that the host cells were E. coli C0214(DE3) (22Marobbio C.M.T. Agrimi G. Lasorsa F.M. Palmieri F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5975-5982Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Control cultures with the empty vector were processed in parallel. Inclusion bodies were purified on a sucrose density gradient (21Fiermonte G. Walker J.E. Palmieri F. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and washed at 4 °C, first with TE buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0), then twice with a buffer containing Triton X-114 (3%, w/v), 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, and finally with 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.0. Ndt1p or Ndt2p was solubilized in 1.6% Sarkosyl (w/v). Small residues were removed by centrifugation (258,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C). Reconstitution into Liposomes and Transport Assays—The recombinant protein in Sarkosyl was reconstituted into liposomes in the presence of substrates, as described previously (23Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). External substrate was removed from proteoliposomes on Sephadex G-75 columns, pre-equilibrated with 50 mm NaCl and 10 mm PIPES-NaOH at pH 7.0 (buffer A). Transport at 25 °C was started by adding [3H]NAD+ (Moravek Biochemicals, Brea, CA) or the indicated radioactive substrate to proteoliposomes and terminated by the addition of 20 mm bathophenanthroline and 30 mm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (the “inhibitor-stop” method (23Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar)). In controls, the inhibitors were added at the beginning together with the radioactive substrate. All transport measurements were carried out in the presence of 10 mm PIPES at pH 7.0 in the internal and external compartments. The external substrate was removed, and the radioactivity in the liposomes was measured (23Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The experimental values were corrected by subtracting control values. The initial transport rate was calculated from the radioactivity taken up by proteoliposomes after 45 s (in the initial linear range of substrate uptake). For efflux measurements, proteoliposomes containing 2 mm NAD+ were labeled with 20 μm [3H]NAD+ by carrier-mediated exchange equilibration (23Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). After 40 min, external radioactivity was removed by passing the proteoliposomes through Sephadex G-75 columns. Efflux was started by adding unlabeled external substrate or buffer A alone and terminated by adding the inhibitors indicated above. Subcellular Localization of Ndt1p—The yeast strain BY4742 was transformed with the pUG35 vector containing the coding sequence for Ndt1p in-frame with the yEGFP (yeast-enhanced green fluorescent protein) coding sequence under the control of the MET25 promoter. Cells were grown in ethanol-supplemented SC medium until mid-logarithmic phase and transferred to the same medium without methionine. After 4 h the cells were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C in the presence of 50 nm MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes), washed twice with fresh medium, and imaged at the microscope as described previously (22Marobbio C.M.T. Agrimi G. Lasorsa F.M. Palmieri F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5975-5982Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). NAD+ and NADH Determination by Mass Spectrometry—For mass spectrometry analysis of NAD+ and NADH, mitochondria were extracted as described (24Noack H. Kunz W.S. Augustin W. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A Quattro Premier mass spectrometer interfaced with an Alliance 2695 high-performance liquid chromatography system (Waters, Milford, MA) was employed for electrospray ionization LC-MS/MS analysis in the positive ion mode. The multiple reaction monitoring transition monitored for NAD+ was m/z 664.2 > 428.2 and for NADH m/z 666.2 > 649.1. Chromatographic resolution of NAD+ and NADH was achieved using an Atlantis dC18 column (2.1 × 150 mm, 5-μm particle size, Waters) eluted with a linear gradient from 100% 10 mm ammonium formate (initial phase) to 10% 10 mm ammonium formate/90% methanol. The flow was set at 0.3 ml/min. Calibration curves were established using standards, processed in the same conditions as the samples, at four concentrations. The lines of best fit were determined using regression analysis based on the peak area of the analytes. Other Methods—NAD+ synthetase and NAMN/NMN adenylyltransferase activities were assayed according to published protocols (25Zalkin H. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 26Balducci E. Emanuelli M. Raffaelli N. Ruggirei S. Amici A. Magni G. Orsomando G. Polzonetti V. Natalini P. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), except that NAD+ produced after 1 h was quantified by LC-MS/MS analysis. The activities of PDH and ACDH were measured as described in Refs. 27Flikweert M.T. van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 3399-3404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 28Bostian K.A. Betts G.F. Biochem. J. 1978; 173: 773-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, respectively, except that only the NAD+ present in the mitochondrial extracts was added to the assay mixtures. In these assays, NAD+ was regenerated by the diaphorase-coupled cycling reaction (29Graeff R. Lee C. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and the increase in fluorescence due to resorufin production was monitored by an LS 50B luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Citrate synthase was measured as described before (30Srere P.A. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 1-11Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue dye. The N termini were sequenced, and the amount of purified proteins was estimated by laser densitometry of stained samples using carbonic anhydrase as a protein standard (31Fiermonte G. Dolce V. Palmieri F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22782-22787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The amount of protein incorporated into liposomes was measured as described (31Fiermonte G. Dolce V. Palmieri F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22782-22787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and was ∼25% of the protein added to the reconstitution mixture. Sequence Features of Ndt1p and Ndt2p—The proteins encoded by YIL006W and YEL006W, named Ndt1p and Ndt2p, respectively, belong to the MCF, because their amino acid sequences are composed of 3 tandem repeats of about 100 amino acids, each containing two transmembrane α-helices, linked by an extensive loop, and a conserved signature motif (see Ref. 32Palmieri F. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 689-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar for a review). Compared with other MCF members, Ndt1p and Ndt2p exhibit a tryptophan instead of an acidic residue in the signature motif of the second repeat (PIWVVK). This characteristic feature is found in a mitochondrial carrier subfamily, which in S. cerevisiae comprises Flx1p (encoded by YIL134W) and Rim2p (encoded by YBR192W). A major difference between Ndt1p and Ndt2p is that the N-terminal extension of the former is 39 amino acids longer than the extension of the latter. Ndt1p is therefore longer than the great majority of mitochondrial carriers (molecular mass, 30–34 kDa) and shorter than the Ca2+-activated mitochondrial carriers (molecular mass, 50–60 kDa) (see Ref. 32Palmieri F. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 689-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar for a review and Ref. 33Fiermonte G. De Leonardis F. Todisco S. Palmieri L. Lasorsa F.M. Palmieri F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30722-30730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Bacterial Expression of Ndt1p and Ndt2p—The NDT1 and NDT2 genes were overexpressed in E. coli C0214(DE3). The respective proteins were accumulated as inclusion bodies and purified by centrifugation and washing. The purified proteins gave a single band by SDS-PAGE with apparent molecular masses of ∼42.0 and 37.5 kDa for Ndt1p and Ndt2p, respectively (data not shown), in agreement with the calculated values with initiator methionine (41,951 and 36,975 Da, respectively). Their identities were confirmed by N-terminal sequencing. The proteins were not detected in bacteria harvested immediately before the induction of expression nor in cells harvested after induction but lacking the coding sequence in the expression vector. Approximately 100 mg of Ndt1p and 75 mg of Ndt2p per liter of culture were obtained. Functional Characterization of Ndt1p—In the search for potential substrates of Ndt1p and Ndt2p, we based our choice on the fact that these proteins are most closely related to Flx1p (34Tzagoloff A. Jang J. Glerum D.M. Wu M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7392-7397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and Rim2p (35Marobbio C.M.T. Di Noia M.A. Palmieri F. Biochem. J. September 29, 2005; 10.1042/BJ20051284Google Scholar), which transport coenzyme FAD and pyrimidine nucleotides, respectively. Proteoliposomes reconstituted with recombinant Ndt1p catalyzed an active [3H]NAD+/NAD+ exchange that was completely inhibited by a mixture of bathophenanthroline and pyridoxal 5′-phosphate. They did not catalyze homo-exchanges for pyruvate, nicotinamide, folate, citrate, carnitine, and aspartate (internal concentration, 10 mm; external concentration, 1 mm) (results not shown). Importantly, no [3H]NAD+/NAD+ exchange activity was detected if Ndt1p had been boiled before incorporation into liposomes or if proteoliposomes were reconstituted with Sarkosyl-solubilized material from bacterial cells either lacking the expression vector for Ndt1p or harvested immediately before induction of expression. Likewise, no such activity was detected in liposomes reconstituted with six unrelated mitochondrial carriers, Ort1p (36Palmieri L. De Marco V. Iacobazzi V. Palmieri F. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E.

September 29, 2005; 10.1042/BJ20051284Google Scholar), which had been expressed and purified from E. coli. At variance with Ndt1p, recombinant and reconstituted Ndt2p showed no activity under any of the experimental conditions tested, which include variation of the parameters that influence solubilization of the inclusion bodies and reconstitution of the protein into liposomes. To investigate the substrate specificity of Ndt1p in more detail, we measured the uptake of [3H]NAD+ into proteoliposomes that had been preloaded with a variety of potential substrates (Fig. 1). The highest activity of [3H]NAD+ uptake into proteoliposomes was with internal NAD+. [3H]NAD+ also exchanged substantially with internal NAAD, (d)AMP, and (d)GMP. Notably, internal α-NAD+, NADH, NMN, NAMN, and ADP-ribose were very poor counter-substrates. In addition, NADP+, NADPH, nicotinamide, and nicotinic acid were virtually not exchanged. Among nucleotides, those of A and G exchanged with [3H]NAD+ more effectively than those of U, T, and C. In all cases, internal nucleoside diphosphate and nucleoside triphosphate were less effective than nucleoside monophosphate, and the deoxynucleotides were nearly as effective as the corresponding nucleotides. Interestingly, [3H]NAD+ also exchanged, to some extent, with internal FMN, FAD, and 3′-AMP. In contrast, the uptake of [3H]NAD+ was negligible in the presence of internal cAMP, adenosine, coenzyme A, pyruvate, thiamine monophosphate, ornithine, NaCl (Fig. 1), and cGMP, thiamine, thiamine diphosphate, S-adenosylmethionine, succinate, malate, malonate, oxoglutarate, oxalacetate, phosphoenolpyruvate, citrate, carnitine, aspartate, glutamate, glutamine, lysine, arginine, histidine, proline, threonine, glutathione, choline, and spermine (data not shown). In contrast with the data shown for Ndt1p in Fig. 1, no uptake of [3H]NAD+ was observed in liposomes reconstituted with Ort1p, Sfc1p, Sam5p, Ggc1p, APC, GC1, or Rim2p containing even their best substrate, i.e. ornithine, fumarate, S-adenosylmethionine, GTP, ATP-Mg, glutamate, or TTP, respectively. The [3H]NAD+/NAD+ exchange reaction catalyzed by reconstituted Ndt1p was inhibited markedly by mercurials (p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, mersalyl, and mercuric chloride), pyridoxal 5′-phosphate and bathophenanthroline (inhibitors of several mitochondrial carriers), as well as by bromcresol purple and tannic acid (inhibitors of the glutamate carrier) (Fig. 2). In contrast, little inhibition was observed with N-ethylmaleimide, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate, 1,2,3-benzenetricarboxylate, butylmalonate, carboxyatractyloside, and bongkrekic acid (inhibitors of other mitochondrial carriers). Kinetic Characteristics of Recombinant Ndt1p—The kinetics were compared for the uptake of 1 mm [3H]NAD+ into proteoliposomes either as uniport (in the absence of internal NAD+) or as exchange (in the presence of 10 mm NAD+) (Fig. 3). The uptake of NAD+ by exchange followed a first-order kinetics (rate constant, 0.06 min–1; initial rate, 442 nmol/min per mg of protein), isotopic equilibrium being approached exponentially. In contrast, the uniport uptake of NAD+ was very low. The uniport mode of transport was further investigated by measuring the efflux of [3H]NAD+ from prelabeled active proteoliposomes, because it provides a more convenient assay for unidirectional transport (23Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In these experiments, little yet significant efflux of [3H]NAD+ from prelabeled proteoliposomes was observed in the absence of external substrate, whereas extensive efflux occurred upon addition of external NAD+ or AMP (Fig. 3). Both effluxes, i.e. with and without external substrate, were prevented completely if the inhibitors bathophenanthroline and pyridoxal 5′-phosphate were present (data not shown). Therefore, Ndt1p is able to catalyze a low unidirectional transport of NAD+ besides a fast exchange reaction of substrates. The kinetic constants of the recombinant purified Ndt1p were determined by measuring the initial transport rate at various external [3H]NAD+ concentrations in the presence of a constant saturating internal concentration of 10 mm NAD+. The transport affinity (Km) and specific activity (Vmax) values for NAD+/NAD+ exchange at 25 °C were 0.38 ± 0.04 mm and 617 ± 97 nmol/min per mg of protein, respectively, in 40 experiments. The Km value of Ndt1p for NAD+ reported here is virtually the same as that found for the uptake of [14C]NAD+ into potato mitochondria (13Tobin A. Djedjiour B. Journet E. Neuburger M. Douce R. Plant Physiol. 1980; 66: 225-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This value is lower than the intracellular concentrations of 1–3 mm of NAD+ plus NADH found in yeast (40Lin S.J. Ford E. Haigis M. Liszt G. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar and references therein). However, it should be noted that most of the total cellular NAD+ and NADH is bound to proteins and that only ∼10% has be"
https://openalex.org/W1980576384,"The highly invasive behavior of glioblastoma cells contributes to the morbidity and mortality associated with these tumors. The integrin-mediated adhesion and migration of glioblastoma cells on brain matrix proteins is enhanced by stimulation with growth factors, including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). As focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a nonreceptor cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, has been shown to promote cell migration in various other cell types, we analysed its role in glioblastoma cell migration. Forced overexpression of FAK in serum-starved glioblastoma cells plated on recombinant (rec)-osteopontin resulted in a twofold enhancement of basal migration and a ninefold enhancement of PDGF-BB-stimulated migration. Both expression of mutant FAK(397F) and the downregulation of FAK with small interfering (si) RNA inhibited basal and PDGF-stimulated migration. FAK overexpression and PDGF stimulation was found to increase the phosphorylation of the Crk-associated substrate (CAS) family member human enhancer of filamentation 1 (HEF1), but not p130CAS or Src-interacting protein (Sin)/Efs, although the levels of expression of these proteins was similar. Moreover downregulation of HEF1 with siRNA, but not p130CAS, inhibited basal and PDGF-stimulated migration. The phosphorylated HEF1 colocalized with vinculin and was associated almost exclusively with 0.1% Triton X-100 insoluble material, consistent with its signaling at focal adhesions. FAK overexpression promoted invasion through normal brain homogenate and siHEF1 inhibited this invasion. Results presented here suggest that HEF1 acts as a necessary and specific downstream effector of FAK in the invasive behavior of glioblastoma cells and may be an effective target for treatment of these tumors."

https://openalex.org/W2142828330,"The classification of peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) is still a matter of debate. To establish a molecular classification of PTCL, we analysed 59 primary nodal T-cell lymphomas using cDNA microarrays, including 56 PTCL and three T-lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL). The expression profiles could discriminate angioimmunoblastic lymphoma, anaplastic large-cell lymphoma and T-LBL. In contrast, cases belonging to the broad category of 'PTCL, unspecified' (PTCL-U) did not share a single molecular profile. Using a multiclass predictor, we could separate PTCL-U into three molecular subgroups called U1, U2 and U3. The U1 gene expression signature included genes known to be associated with poor outcome in other tumors, such as CCND2. The U2 subgroup was associated with overexpression of genes involved in T-cell activation and apoptosis, including NFKB1 and BCL-2. The U3 subgroup was mainly defined by overexpression of genes involved in the IFN/JAK/STAT pathway. It comprised a majority of histiocyte-rich PTCL samples. Gene Ontology annotations revealed different functional profile for each subgroup. These results suggest the existence of distinct subtypes of PTCL-U with specific molecular profiles, and thus provide a basis to improve their classification and to develop new therapeutic targets."

To identify mechanisms of gene regulation for these critical cardiac apoptosis effectors, the determinants of Nix and BNip3 promoter activation were elucidated by luciferase reporter gene expression in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. BNip3 transcription was increased by hypoxia but not by phenylephrine (10 μm), angiotensin II (100 nm), or isoproterenol (10 μm). In contrast, Nix transcription was increased by phenylephrine but not by isoproterenol, angiotensin II, or hypoxia. Since phenylephrine stimulates cardiomyocyte hypertrophy via protein kinase C (PKC), the effects of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, 10 nm for 24 h) and adenoviral PKC expression were assessed. PMA and PKCα, but not PKCϵ or dominant negative PKCα, increased Nix transcription. Multiple Nix promoter GC boxes bound transcription factor Sp-1, and basal and PMA- or PKCα-stimulated Nix promoter activity was suppressed by mithramycin inhibition of Sp1-DNA interactions. In vivo determinants of Nix expression were evaluated in Nix promoter-luciferase (NixP) transgenic mice that underwent ischemia-reperfusion (1 h/24 h), transverse aortic coarctation (TAC), or cross-breeding with the Gq overexpression model of hypertrophy.

Indeed, mitochondrial disruption may have especially profound consequences for the heart as myocardium is enriched in mitochondria and has a high rate of energy utilization (15Marin-Garcia J. Goldenthal M.J. J. Card. Fail. 2002; 8: 347-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We examined the hypothesis that cardiac regulation of these two closely related mitochondrial death proteins would, because of their functional similarities, be distinct, i.e. that each was the apoptotic effector of a different cell stress pathway. Previous reports have defined in detail the physiological mechanisms and molecular determinants of BNip3 gene regulation; BNip3 expression varies between tissue types (16Yasuda M. Han J.W. Dionne C.A. Boyd J.M. Chinnadurai G.

Nix, on the other hand, is constitutively expressed in many tissues, including the heart (18Matsushima M. Fujiwara T. Takahashi E. Minaguchi T. Eguchi Y. Tsujimoto Y. Suzumori K. Nakamura Y.

Notwithstanding the absence of positive data for Nix transcriptional regulation in ischemic cardiac tissue, the presence of three putative HREs in the human Nix promoter (20Aerbajinai W. Giattina M. Lee Y.T. Raffeld M. Miller J.L. Blood. 2003; 102: 712-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and a report of hypoxic induction of Nix in cultured tumor cell lines (17Sowter H.M. Ratcliffe P.J. Watson P. Greenberg A.H. Harris A.L. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6669-6673PubMed Google Scholar) have led to general acceptance of the notion that cardiac Nix and BNip3 are both hypoxia-inducible (21Crow M.T. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and are regulated in a similar manner, by similar pathways (11Zhang H.M. Cheung P. Yanagawa B. McManus B.M. Yang D.C. Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The biological advantage of such a high degree of functional and regulatory overlap is not immediately obvious. In contrast, distinct regulatory mechanisms for Nix and BNip3 would constrain apoptotic responses to uniquely defined conditions, which might be optimal for cell death programming in a terminally differentiated organ, such as the heart. Herein, we have described the cloning, characterization, and in vitro and in vivo functional analyses of the mouse Nix promoter. When compared with BNip3, the basal pattern of Nix expression differs between tissue types, and in the heart, Nix is induced by entirely different physiological stimuli. Hypertrophy-inducible cardiac Nix expression was mediated by protein kinase C (PKC) α activation and dependent upon binding of the transcription factor Sp1. These results contradicted accepted dogma regarding hypoxic induction of cardiac Nix and established that Nix and BNip3 represent the terminal effectors of distinct stress-mediated intrinsic cardiomyocyte apoptosis pathways for hypertrophy and hypoxia. Cloning of the Mouse Nix and BNip3 Gene Promoters and Creation of Promoter-Reporter Constructs—We employed a PCR-based strategy using high fidelity DNA polymerase to amplify the intergenic region between Nix and protein phosphatase 2a (PP2a), comprising the upstream Nix promoter. A 7.4-kb DNA fragment was PCR-amplified from C57/BL6 genomic DNA utilizing the primers 5′-CTAGCTAGCTCTTGCACCATCTTGCCTGGT-3′ and 5′-CTGGAGCTCCCGTGCTCACTGTTGAGGCCAGCG-3′. To facilitate cloning, the oligonucleotides were engineered with NheI and SacI sites (underlined), respectively. The PCR products were digested with NheI and SacI and subcloned into the XbaI and SacI sites of pBS (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) The Nix promoter region was verified by DNA sequence analysis. The 7.4-kb Nix promoter was subsequently digested with EcoRV, EcoRI, SacI, and PstI to generate a series of 5′ deletions that were cloned into pGL3-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI) to create Nix promoter-luciferase reporter constructs. A similar strategy was used to create a pGL3-Basic luciferase reporter construct from the 2.3-kb human BNip3 promoter. Cardiomyocyte Culture and Transfection—Ventricular myocytes were isolated from 1–2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats and cultured as described (8Regula K.M. Ens K. Kirshenbaum L.A. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). For promoter-reporter studies, 1.0 μg of plasmid DNA was transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). After 24 h, transfected cardiomyocyte cultures were infected with PKC adenoviri (multiplicity of infection of 10), cultivated under hypoxic conditions (95% N2, 5% CO2, with less than 1% O2 by oxygen sensor), or treated with chemical agents (10 nm phorbol myristate acetate in dimethyl sulfoxide, 10 μm phenylephrine, 10 μm isoproterenol, or 100 nm or 1 μm angiotensin II). Generation of Nix Promoter-Luciferase Transgenic Mice—The– 5.362-kb Nix promoter-luciferase construct, linearized and separated from vector DNA, was injected into the male pronucleus of FVBN single cell mouse embryos, implanted into pseudopregnant females. Three founders were identified by genomic Southern analysis of tail clip DNA, and colonies were established. There was no apparent phenotype in any of the promoter-reporter transgenic mouse lines. Acute pressure overloading by microsurgical transverse aortic coarctation (TAC) for 4 days and infarction-reperfusion (1-h occlusion of left anterior descending artery followed by 24 h reperfusion) were modeled as described (10Yussman M.G.

Animals were treated in accordance with approved University of Cincinnati Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocols. mRNA Analysis—Northern blots used 2 μg of poly(A)+ mRNA, hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNAs for Nix or BNip3. For Nix, blots were also hybridized to a 700-bp fragment of the extreme 3′-untranslated region, which recognizes only the higher molecular weight Nix transcript (10Yussman M.G. Toyokawa T. Odley A.

A mouse multiple tissue Northern blot was purchased from Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Luciferase Assays—Myocytes were harvested, lysed in cell culture lysis reagent (Promega), and clarified by centrifugation at 1,000 × g, and the supernatant was immediately assayed for luciferase activity. Hearts and other organs were weighed after removal and immediately homogenized in 1 ml of cell culture lysis reagent 1× (Promega) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min, and fresh supernatants were assayed for luciferase activity in a Berthold luminometer (Sirius) using the Luciferase assay system from Promega. Relative luciferase activity was normalized to protein content (Bradford assay). Data are reported as induction relative to empty vector (pGL3-Basic) for myocytes or relative luminescence units per microgram of protein (relative luminescence units/μg protein) for tissue samples. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Gel mobility shift assays were performed essentially as described previously (23D'Angelo D.D. Oliver B.G. Davis M.G. McCluskey T.S. Dorn G.W. J. Biol.

Confocal Immunohistochemistry Studies—Deparafinized sections underwent antigen retrieval by heating in 10 mm citric buffer/2 mm EDTA, pH 6.2, and were immunolabeled with anti-Sp1 (PEP-2) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology or anti-luciferase clone mAB21 from Upstate Biotechnology. Detection used anti-mouse conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 or anti-rabbit conjugated with Alexa Fluor 568 IgGs (Molecular Probes). Sections were examined on a Nikon PCM2000 laser confocal microscope. Statistical Analysis—Results are reported as means ± S.E. All transfections were performed in duplicate. Experimental groups were compared using Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance. A Bonferroni test was used for post-hoc comparisons, with p < 0.05 indicating significance. In Vivo Nix and BNip3 Gene Expression—Mouse Nix (GenBank™ accession number AF067395) is located on chromosome 14D1, immediately 3′ of PP2a. We used PCR to amplify this intergenic region. Sequencing of the Nix promoter revealed the absence of consensus TATA or CCAAT transcription initiator elements but the presence of several GC boxes 5′ to the transcription start site, which is typical of TATA-less promoters (Fig. 1A). The presence of several HREs in the human Nix promoter has been noted previously (20Aerbajinai W. Giattina M. Lee Y.T. Raffeld M. Miller J.L. Blood. 2003; 102: 712-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and forms a basis for the assumption that, like BNip3, Nix is regulated in experimental cardiac hypoxia (21Crow M.T. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Indeed, the mouse Nix promoter and human BNip3 promoter are similar in that both possess multiple putative HRE and GC box motifs (Fig. 1A). To determine whether Nix and BNip3 are co-regulated, we performed comparative Northern blot analysis for these two transcripts across different mouse tissues. Nix expression appeared constitutive, with modest transcript levels in almost all tissues assayed, whereas BNip3 transcript levels varied greatly between different organs, being highest in heart, liver, and kidney (Fig. 1B). These distinct patterns of gene expression across tissues suggested that, in addition to having distinct basal expression patterns, the Nix and BNip3 genes might be differentially induced. In Vitro Analysis of Nix and BNip3 Promoters—To identify conditions for differential regulation of Nix and BNip3 in the heart, 5′-flanking sequences of each gene were linked to a luciferase reporter and transiently expressed in cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (NRCM). Culture of NRCM in a hypoxic environment (<1% 02) increased BNip3, but not Nix, promoter-reporter activity (Fig. 1C). The transcriptional response to cardiac-acting neurohormones also differed. Nix promoter activity was induced by phenylephrine, a potent Gq-coupled hypertrophic agonist in this system (24Bishopric N.H. Simpson P.C. Ordahl C.P. J. Clin. Investig. 1987; 80: 1194-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 25Waspe L.E. Ordahl C.P. Simpson P.C. J. Clin. Investig. 1990; 85: 1206-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), but not isoproterenol or angiotensin II. In contrast, BNip3 promoter activity was not induced by any of these agents, and transcription in response to phenylephrine and isoproterenol was significantly repressed. Thus, the in vitro NRCM promoter-reporter system demonstrated distinct regulation of Nix and BNip3 to environmental and hormonal stressors; BNip3 is exclusively induced by hypoxia, whereas Nix is induced by the hypertrophic agonist phenylephrine. Since the mechanisms for hypoxic BNip3 induction have previously been studied in detail (9Kubasiak L.A. Hernandez O.M. Bishopric N.H. Webster K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12825-12830Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), and those for hypertrophic induction of Nix are entirely unknown, subsequent studies focused on Nix. The functional significance of individual cis-elements in the Nix promoter was assessed in assays of basal and stimulated activity of 5′ deletion Nix promoter-luciferase reporter constructs transfected into NRCM and by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. As depicted in Fig. 2A, basal Nix promoter-reporter activity diminished in proportion to the length of the constructs, from –5.36 kb to –0.19 kb (Fig. 2A). A Nix promoter-reporter construct containing the complete ∼7-kb PP2a-Nix intergenic region had a very low level of basal transcriptional activity, likely attributable to regulatory elements from the PP2a gene (data not shown), and was not studied further. Thus, loss of GC boxes corresponded with loss of basal promoter activity. As previous reports have linked responsiveness of GC box-rich promoters in several genes with regulated binding of the transcription factor, Sp1, to GC elements (23D'Angelo D.D. Oliver B.G.

Biochem. 2003; 270: 1855-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we used electrophoretic mobility shift assays to determine whether the same mechanism could be operative for Nix (Fig. 2, B and C). When compared with a synthetic oligonucleotide encoding an authentic Sp1 binding site (cont), an identical band was seen with a nucleotide spanning the –8 to –1 region (probe A), the –141 to –134 region (probe B), and the –322 to –316 region (probe C) of the Nix promoter but not probe A with a mutated GC box. Competition with excess unlabeled authentic Sp1 oligonucleotide eliminated the band, and the addition of anti-Sp1 antibody resulted in a supershift. These results demonstrated that Sp1 binds specifically to GC-rich motifs in the Nix promoter. The mechanism for Sp1-mediated regulation of signaling genes has been reported as induction of this factor by PKC (23D'Angelo D.D. Oliver B.G. Davis M.G. McCluskey T.S. Dorn G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19696-19704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 26Kim E. Muga S.J. Fischer S.M. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2003; 270: 1855-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Our studies showed that phenylephrine, which is known to induce hypertrophy in NRCM by activating PKC (30Kariya K. Farrance I.K. Simpson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26658-26662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kariya K. Karns L.R. Simpson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3775-3782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), specifically increased NRCM Nix promoter activity (Fig. 1C). Accordingly, we assessed the consequences on Nix transcription of directly activating PKC with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, 10 nm for 24 h). As shown in Fig. 3A, PMA treatment increased Nix transcriptional activity in all constructs. Based on the observed parallel loss of Nix promoter activity and GC-rich elements in the series of 5′-truncated Nix promoter-reporter constructs and the observation that at least some of these elements bound the PMA-responsive transcription factor Sp1 (23D'Angelo D.D. Oliver B.G. Davis M.G. McCluskey T.S. Dorn G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19696-19704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we considered that inhibition of promoter-Sp1 binding should depress Nix transcription. Indeed, disrupting Sp1 binding to GC boxes with mithramycin A (26Kim E. Muga S.J. Fischer S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11188-11197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) decreased basal activity and eliminated PMA responsiveness for each of the Nix promoter-reporter constructs (Fig. 3A). In the above studies, phorbol ester stimulation of Nix promoter activity was employed as a pharmacological surrogate for endogenous diacylglycerol-mediated activation of PKC. To determine whether PKC per se was capable of inducing Nix transcription and to elucidate any preferential activity of relevant PKC isoforms in this function, NRCM transfected with –5.36-kb NixP were infected with adenovirus encoding either PKCα or PKCϵ, the two most highly cardiac-expressed conventional and novel PKC isoforms, respectively (32Hahn H.S. Marreez Y. Odley A. Sterbling A. Yussman M.G. Hilty K.C. Bodi I. Liggett S.B. Schwartz A. Dorn G.W. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). (Transfection of NRCM with adeno-PKCδ induced spontaneous cell death by apoptosis (not shown) and therefore could not be included in the comparison). As shown in Fig. 3B, PKCα, but not PKCϵ, increased Nix promoter activity in non-treated cardiac myocytes to levels comparable with stimulation with PMA, consistent with a major role for this isoform. Dominant negative PKCα was without any effects on Nix transcription (Fig. 3B). Collectively, these studies delineate a Sp1-dependent mechanism for Nix transcriptional activation by PKCα in NRCM. In Vivo Analysis of the Mouse Nix Promoter—The in vivo determinants of Nix transcriptional regulation were evaluated in three independent transgenic mouse lines expressing the –5.362-kb NixP-luciferase (NixP-luc) construct. Consistent with constitutive low level expression on the multiple-tissue Northern blot, basal luciferase activity was low in all organs sampled, although it was higher in hearts than in other organs tested (Fig. 4A, inset). When compared with baseline, cardiac NixP-luc activity was increased in acutely pressure overloaded hearts (108 ± 9 mm mercury for 4 days) and in NixP-luc mice crossed onto the Gαq transgenic background (33D'Angelo D.D. Sakata Y. Lorenz J.N. Boivin G.P. Walsh R.A. Liggett S.B. Dorn G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8121-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) but not in hearts 24 h after 1 h of reversible ischemia of the left anterior descending coronary artery (Fig. 4A), a period of time previously determined to be sufficient for induction of BNip3 (8Regula K.M. Ens K. Kirshenbaum L.A. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Nix transcriptional activity, assayed with the luciferase reporter, was directly proportional to the magnitude of pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy assessed as heart weight corrected for body weight (p < 0.05, r = 0.71; Fig. 4B). To determine whether the mechanism for Nix induction in pressure overload and Gαq-dependent cardiac hypertrophy was Sp1-mediated as suggested by the NRCM studies, NixP-luc activity was assayed in separate cohorts of Gαq transgenic/NixP-luc mice treated for 14 days with mithramycin (400 μg/kg/day, intraperitoneal, Fig. 4C). As in NRCM (Fig. 3), in vivo suppression of hypertrophy-mediated Nix induction by mithramycin shows that Nix transcriptional regulation is dependent upon Sp1. Consistent with these findings, Sp1 expression was increased in parallel with Nix transcriptional activity (measured as luciferase protein expression) in NixP-luc mice crossed with Gαq overexpressors (Fig. 4D). The current results contradict the widely held notion that Nix and BNip3, the two major cardiac BH3-only proteins, are regulated by similar mechanisms (11Zhang H.M. Cheung P. Yanagawa B. McManus B.M. Yang D.C. Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 21Crow M.T. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Instead, each of these two powerful mitochondrial death proteins appeared to be induced by a different set of physiological and neurohormonal stimuli. Thus, Nix is the apoptotic effector for myocardial hypertrophy, whereas BNip3 is the apoptotic effector for cardiac hypoxia. These observations not only impacted our understanding of disease-specific pathways for programmed cardiomyocyte suicide but also defined separate targets for therapeutics directed at preventing apoptosis in ischemic myocardial injury versus cardiac hypertrophy decompensation. Cardiac apoptosis is thought to have pathophysiological relevance in chronic heart failure and after myocardial infarction, which are the clinical syndromes corresponding to the circumstances under which Nix and BNip3 are reportedly up-regulated. In ischemic and dilated human cardiomyopathies, the prevalence of apoptotic cardiomyocytes is markedly increased (1Narula J. Haider N. Virmani R. DiSalvo T.G. Kolodgie F.D. Hajjar R.J. Schmidt U.

Although it has not been possible to determine whether apoptosis is a contributory factor in human heart failure decompensation (or is simply a consequence of functional deterioration), experimental models have unambiguously demonstrated the potential for either chronic indolent (34Wencker D. Chandra M. Nguyen K. Miao W. Garantziotis S. Factor S.M. Shirani J. Armstrong R.C. Kitsis R.N. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1497-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar) or acute severe (5Hirota H. Chen J. Betz U.A. Rajewsky K. Gu Y. Ross Jr., J. Muller W. Chien K.R. Cell. 1999; 97: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) myocardial apoptosis to cause heart failure. Indeed, human pressure overload cardiac hypertrophy is associated with Nix induction (10Yussman M.G. Toyokawa T. Odley A. Lynch R.A. Wu G. Colbert M.C. Aronow B.J. Lorenz J.N. Dorn G.W. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), and inhibition of Nix with a dominant negative mutant defective in mitochondrial targeting is protective against apoptotic peripartum heart failure in the Gαq transgenic model (10Yussman M.G. Toyokawa T. Odley A. Lynch R.A. Wu G. Colbert M.C. Aronow B.J. Lorenz J.N. Dorn G.W. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). These data suggest at least the strong possibility that programmed cell death in general, and Nix-mediated apoptosis in particular, contributes to hypertrophy decompensation and the progression of heart failure. In contrast, BNip3 is not regulated in cardiac hypertrophy or by hypertrophic agonists but is dramatically increased in expression by hypoxia or ischemia (8Regula K.M. Ens K. Kirshenbaum L.A. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 9Kubasiak L.A. Hernandez O.M. Bishopric N.H. Webster K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12825-12830Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The distinct regulatory pathways for Nix and BNip3 are of particular interest because the two proteins have virtually identical functions. Both are proapoptotic BH3-only members of the Bcl-2 superfamily of apoptotic regulatory proteins, both are targeted to mitochondria by a C-terminal transmembrane spanning sequence, and both must interact with other Bcl-2 proteins, such as Bax or Bad, to initiate apoptosis by cytochrome c release and activation of the intrinsic pathway (11Zhang H.M. Cheung P. Yanagawa B. McManus B.M. Yang D.C. Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 14Graham R.M. Frazier D.P. Thompson J.W. Haliko S. Li H. Wasserlauf B.J. Spiga M.G.

Indeed, there has been some confusion as to whether Nix and BNip3 were products of the same or different genes, contributed to by the original nomenclature for Nix as “BNip3L” (18Matsushima M. Fujiwara T. Takahashi E. Minaguchi T. Eguchi Y. Tsujimoto Y. Suzumori K. Nakamura Y. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1998; 21: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 19Chen G. Cizeau J.

The current studies showed that these related apoptotic factors are the products of different genes that are regulated by distinct physiological conditions in the heart. Although it is possible that Nix and BNip3 can also be co-regulated in other conditions, such as by hypoxia in human tumor cells (17Sowter H.M. Ratcliffe P.J. Watson P. Greenberg A.H. Harris A.L. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6669-6673PubMed Google Scholar), the striking differences in cardiac regulation imply unique pathophysiologies, despite apparent functional redundancy at the protein level. Gene targeting experiments will likely be needed to precisely define the contributions of Nix and BNip3 genes in the in vivo context. The molecular mechanisms of cardiac BNip3 induction have previously been elucidated in detail (8Regula K.M. Ens K. Kirshenbaum L.A. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 9Kubasiak L.A. Hernandez O.M. Bishopric N.H. Webster K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12825-12830Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Hypoxia/acidosis is a powerful stimulus for BNip3 transcription, mediated by the proximal HRE in the promoter region. In contrast, Nix transcription was not increased by either in vitro hypoxia or angiotensin II application. Instead, it was increased by those stimuli that are associated with development of myocardial or cardiac myocyte hypertrophy, i.e. phenylephrine application, Gαq overexpression, and pressure overload (10Yussman M.G. Toyokawa T. Odley A. Lynch R.A. Wu G. Colbert M.C. Aronow B.J. Lorenz J.N. Dorn G.W. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 24Bishopric N.H. Simpson P.C. Ordahl C.P.

Chem. 1993; 268: 26658-26662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kariya K. Karns L.R. Simpson P.C. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 278-287PubMed Google Scholar), was sufficient to induce Nix promoter activity in cultured NRCM and may be the essential mediator of in vivo Nix induction as well, although the current studies cannot be definitive in this regard. However, it is worth noting that PKCα is transcriptionally increased and activated in Gq-dependent hypertrophy (33D'Angelo D.D. Sakata Y. Lorenz J.N. Boivin G.P. Walsh R.A. Liggett S.B. Dorn G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8121-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 35Dorn G.W. Tepe N.M. Wu G. Yatani A. Liggett S.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 278-287PubMed Google Scholar) and that it has been shown to act synergistically with Gq to cause systolic and diastolic heart failure in experimental mouse models (32Hahn H.S. Marreez Y. Odley A. Sterbling A. Yussman M.G. Hilty K.C. Bodi I. Liggett S.B. Schwartz A. Dorn G.W. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Accordingly, transcriptional up-regulation of Nix is only one of many potentially deleterious effects of PKCα activation in myocardial hypertrophy. In the case of the Nix gene, transcriptional induction was accomplished via Sp1 binding to GC-rich elements within the promoter. This pattern of transcriptional regulation has been described with phorbol ester enhancement of Sp1 binding to other signaling genes, including those for the thromboxane A2 receptor (23D'Angelo D.D.

Chem. 1995; 270: 410-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) also described a similar transcriptional signaling axis for norepinephrine, cardiomyocyte PKCα, and Sp1 that induces the skeletal actin promoter during in vitro NRCM hypertrophy. Suppression of in vivo Gαq-stimulated Nix induction by mithramycin treatment established the relevance of this pathway to the intact organism. These studies corrected the misperception that, like BNip3, cardiac Nix induction is regulated by hypoxia/ischemia. Rather, the signaling events leading to increased Nix expression involved activation of PKCα by hypertrophic agents, induction of Sp1, and its binding to GC box motifs in the promoter. In vivo,Gαq overexpression and pressure overload activate this pathway. The distinct stimuli for, and mechanisms of, Nix and BNip3 transactivation in the heart reveal a tightly regulated and previously unrecognized system for stress-dependent manipulation of cell death in the heart. In the broader pathophysiological context, the delineation of opposing regulatory pathways for functionally identical apoptosis proteins identifies a multiplier effect whereby differentially modulated gene expression increases both the variety and the specificity of biological response."
https://openalex.org/W2044769361,"Skeletal muscle function and viability are dependent upon intact innervation. Peripheral nerve injury and muscle denervation cause muscle atrophy. Time to re-innervation is one of the most important determinants of functional outcome. While short-term denervation can result in nearly fully reversible changes in muscle mass, prolonged denervation leads to irreversible muscle impairment from profound atrophy, myocyte death and fibrosis. We performed transcriptional profiling to identify genes that were altered in expression in short-term (1 month) and long-term (3 month) denervated muscle and validated the microarray data by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Genes controlling cell death, metabolism, proteolysis, stress responses and protein synthesis/translation were altered in expression in the denervated muscle. A differential pattern of expression of genes encoding cell cycle regulators and extracellular matrix components was identified that correlated with the development of irreversible post-denervation changes. Genes encoding mediators of protein degradation were differentially expressed between 1 and 3 month denervated muscle suggesting different signaling networks are recruited over time to induce and maintain muscle atrophy. Understanding of the timing and type of pathological processes that are triggered by denervation may allow the design of interventions that delay or protect muscle from loss of nerve function."
https://openalex.org/W2029497007,"Multidrug resistance may be achieved by the activation of membrane transporters, detoxification, alterations in DNA repair or failure in apoptotic pathways. Recent data have suggested an involvement of mitogenic signalling pathways mediated by Ras and phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K/Akt) in controlling multidrug resistance. Since these pathways are important targets for therapeutic interference, we sought to investigate whether blocking effectors kinases by specific inhibitors would result in a sensitization toward cytotoxic drugs. We found that cotreatment of drug-resistant HT29RDB colon cancer cells with the topoisomerase inhibitor doxorubicin and the PI3K-inhibitor LY294002 resulted in massive apoptosis, while cotreatment with the Mek inhibitors PD98059 or U0126 had no effect. This suggested that the PI3K-pathways controls cell survival and drug resistance in these cells. Besides blocking Akt phosphorylation, the PI3K-inibitor increased the intracellular doxorubicin concentration threefold. LY294002 inhibits drug export in a competitive manner as revealed by measuring drug efflux in the presence and the absence of inhibitor. The efficacy of drug efflux inhibition by LY294002 was similar to that achieved by the MRP1 inhibitors MK571 and genistein. We conclude that the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 may have therapeutic potential when combined with doxorubicin in the treatment of MRP1-mediated drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2023494015,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are transcription factors that strongly influence molecular events in normal and cancer cells. PPAR-beta/delta (PPAR-b/d) overexpression suppresses the activity of PPAR-gamma (PPAR-g) and PPAR-alpha. This interaction has been questioned, however, by studies with synthetic ligands of PPARs in PPAR-b/d-null cells, and it is not known whether an interaction between PPAR-b/d and PPAR-g exists, especially in relation to the signaling by natural PPAR ligands. Oxidative metabolites of linoleic and arachidonic acids are natural ligands of PPARs. 13-S-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-S-HODE), the main product of 15-lipoxygenase-1 (15-LOX-1) metabolism of linoleic acid, downregulates PPAR-b/d. We tested (a) whether PPAR-b/d expression modulates PPAR-g activity in experimental models of the loss and gain of PPAR-b/d function in colon cancer cells and (b) whether 15-LOX-1 formation of 13-S-HODE influences the interaction between PPAR-b/d and PPAR-g. We found that (a) 15-LOX-1 formation of 13-S-HODE promoted PPAR-g activity, (b) PPAR-b/d expression suppressed PPAR-g activity in models of both loss and gain of PPAR-b/d function, (c) 15-LOX-1 activated PPAR-g by downregulating PPAR-b/d, and (d) 15-LOX-1 expression induced apoptosis in colon cancer cells via modulating PPAR-b/d suppression of PPAR-g. These findings elucidate a novel mechanism of the signaling by natural ligands of PPARs, which involves modulating the interaction between PPAR-b/d and PPAR-g."
https://openalex.org/W2089128901,"The neuron-specific K+-Cl- cotransporter KCC2 plays a crucial role in determining intracellular chloride activity and thus the neuronal response to γ-aminobutyric acid and glycine. Of the four KCCs, KCC2 is unique in mediating constitutive K+-Cl- cotransport under isotonic conditions; the other three KCCs are exclusively swelling-activated, with no isotonic activity. We have utilized a series of chimeric cDNAs to localize the determinant of isotonic transport in KCC2. Two generations of chimeric KCC4-KCC2 cDNAs initially localized this characteristic to within a KCC2-specific expansion of the cytoplasmic C terminus, between residues 929 and 1043. This region of KCC2 is rich in prolines, serines, and charged residues and encompasses two predicted PEST sequences. Substitution of this region in KCC2 with the equivalent sequence of KCC4 resulted in a chimeric KCC that was devoid of isotonic activity, with intact swelling-activated transport. A third generation of chimeras demonstrated that a domain just distal to the PEST sequences confers isotonic transport on KCC4. Mutagenesis of this region revealed that residues 1021-1035 of KCC2 are sufficient for isotonic transport. Swelling-activated K+-Cl- cotransport is abrogated by calyculin A, whereas isotonic transport mediated by KCC chimeras and KCC2 is completely resistant to this serine-threonine phosphatase inhibitor. In summary, a 15-residue C-terminal domain in KCC2 is both necessary and sufficient for constitutive K+-Cl- cotransport under isotonic conditions. Furthermore, unlike swelling-activated transport, constitutive K+-Cl- cotransport mediated by KCC2 is completely independent of serine-threonine phosphatase activity, suggesting that these two modes of transport are activated by distinct mechanisms.

All four of the KCCs are swelling-activated, suggesting an important role in volume regulatory decrease (12Lauf P.K. Bauer J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 144: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Indeed, K+-Cl- cotransport was first defined as a swelling-activated and NEM-activated K+ efflux mechanism in red cells (13Dunham P.B. Ellory J.C. J. Physiol.

Targeted deletion of KCC3 abolishes the volume regulatory decrease response of hippocampal neurons and attenuates the volume regulatory decrease in renal proximal tubular cells (17Boettger T.

Despite this evident physiological importance, the molecular determinants of swelling activation have not been elucidated in the KCCs. It is, however, known that swelling activation of red cell K+-Cl- cotransport (19Starke L.C. Jennings M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C118-C124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and of all four KCCs (7Su W. Shmukler B.E. Chernova M.N. Stuart-Tilley A.K. de Franceschi L. Brugnara C. Alper S.L. Am. J.

More recent data have implicated the WNK4 and SPAK serine-threonine kinases in the volume sensitivity of both K+-Cl- cotransport (KCC2) and Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransport (NKCC1) (20Gagnon K.B. England R. Delpire E. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; Google Scholar). KCC2 has several characteristics that differentiate it from the other three KCCs. First, heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes and mammalian cells reveals that KCC2 is unique in mediating constitutive K+-Cl- cotransport under isotonic conditions (6Payne J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1516-C1525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Strange K. Singer T.D. Morrison R. Delpire E. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C860-C867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Song L. Mercado A.

Physiol. 2006; Google Scholar); the other three KCCs are exclusively swelling-activated, without significant activity under isotonic conditions. KCC2 is, however, swelling-activated under hypotonic conditions (8Strange K. Singer T.D. Morrison R. Delpire E. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C860-C867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Song L. Mercado A. Desai R. George A.L.J Gamba G. Mount D.B. Mol. Brain Res. 2002; 103: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 20Gagnon K.B. England R. Delpire E. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; Google Scholar). Second, a structural feature unique to KCC2 is an expanded domain of ∼100 amino acids, rich in prolines, serines, and charged residues, near the end of the cytoplasmic C terminus. This region encompasses two predicted PEST (Proline/E (glutamate)/Serine/Threonine) sequences (21Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar) that are completely unique to KCC2 (see also “Results” and “Discussion”). Third, KCC2 has perhaps the most clearly defined physiological role of the four KCCs. KCC2 is thus a neuron-specific gene (22Williams J.R. Sharp J.W. Kumari V.G. Wilson M. Payne J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12656-12664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 23Lu J. Karadsheh M. Delpire E. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 39: 558-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), with a crucial role in determining intracellular chloride activity ([Cl-]i) and the neuronal response to GABA and glycine (24Payne J.A. Rivera C. Voipio J. Kaila K. Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 199-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 25Hebert S.C. Mount D.B. Gamba G. Pfluegers Arch. 2004; 447: 580-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Early in postnatal life there is robust neuronal expression of the Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter NKCC1 (26Plotkin M.D. Kaplan M.R. Peterson L.N. Gullans S.R. Hebert S.C. Delpire E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C173-C183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with only minimal expression of KCC2. Inward-directed transport by NKCC1 increases [Cl-]i above its equilibrium potential, such that the activation of ligand-gated Cl- conductance by the neurotransmitters GABA and glycine stimulates neuronal depolarization and excitation (27Miles R. Nature. 1999; 397: 215-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 28Sung K.W. Kirby M. McDonald M.P. Lovinger D.M. Delpire E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7531-7538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated a dramatic induction of KCC2 within the first postnatal week (23Lu J. Karadsheh M. Delpire E. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 39: 558-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 29Clayton G.H. Owens G.C. Wolff J.S. Smith R.L. Brain Res. Dev.

Nature. 1999; 397: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1677) Google Scholar), resulting in a dominance of K+-Cl- efflux and a decrease in [Cl-]i to below its equilibrium potential; this results in a shift in the GABA and glycine effect to hyperpolarization and neuronal inhibition (30Rivera C. Voipio J. Payne J.A. Ruusuvuori E. Lahtinen H. Lamsa K. Pirvola U. Saarma M. Kaila K. Nature. 1999; 397: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1677) Google Scholar). Initial indications that GABA itself promotes the developmental induction of KCC2 (31Ganguly K. Schinder A.F. Wong S.T. Poo M. Cell. 2001; 105: 521-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) have not been supported by subsequent studies (32Ludwig A. Li H. Saarma M. Kaila K. Rivera C. Eur. J.

(Lond.). 2003; 550: 719-730Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, the overexpression of KCC2 in immature neurons is clearly sufficient to reduce [Cl-]i (34Chudotvorova I. Ivanov A. Rama S. Hubner C.A. Pellegrino C. Ben-Ari Y. Medina I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 566: 671-679Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 35Lee H. Chen C.X. Liu Y.J. Aizenman E. Kandler K. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 21: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), with a loss of the GABA-induced Ca2+ response (35Lee H. Chen C.X. Liu Y.J. Aizenman E. Kandler K. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 21: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Most surprisingly, several correlates of GABAergic activity are induced by this ectopic overexpression of KCC2 (34Chudotvorova I. Ivanov A. Rama S. Hubner C.A. Pellegrino C. Ben-Ari Y. Medina I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 566: 671-679Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar), suggesting that KCC2 has direct effects on the development of GABAergic synapses. Finally, mice with a targeted deletion of KCC2 have impaired regulation of neuronal [Cl-]i (36Zhu L. Lovinger D. Delpire E. J. Neurophysiol. 2005; 93: 1557-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), with hyperexcitability and early death from generalized seizures (37Woo N.S. Lu J. England R. McClellan R. Dufour S. Mount D.B. Deutch A.Y. Lovinger D.M. Delpire E. Hippocampus. 2002; 12: 258-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Impaired expression and/or activity of KCC2 has also been implicated in several forms of neuronal injury (24Payne J.A. Rivera C. Voipio J. Kaila K.

De Koninck Y. Nature. 2003; 424: 938-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). The physiological role of KCC2-mediated swelling-activated K+-Cl- cotransport is not particularly clear, although one possibility is that it serves to limit neuronal/dendritic swelling in response to glutamatergic excitation (42Gulyas A.I. Sik A. Payne J.A. Kaila K. Freund T.F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 13: 2205-2217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the isotonic activity of KCC2 is clearly suited to the constitutive maintenance of [Cl-]i, a defined physiological role for this transporter (36Zhu L. Lovinger D. Delpire E. J. Neurophysiol. 2005; 93: 1557-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To begin a study of the molecular determinants of constitutive and swelling-activated KCC activity, we have utilized a directed series of chimeric and mutant cDNAs, using human KCC2 (9Song L. Mercado A. Desai R. George A.L.J Gamba G. Mount D.B. Mol. Brain Res. 2002; 103: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and mouse KCC4 (3Mount D.B. Mercado A. Song L. Xu J. George Jr., A.L. Delpire E. Gamba G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16355-16362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) as the starting point. This effort has identified a KCC2-specific C-terminal domain that is both necessary and sufficient for constitutive K+-Cl- cotransport under isotonic conditions. To our knowledge this is the first identification of a discrete cytoplasmic domain that modulates the volume sensitivity of a given class of ion transporter. Furthermore, this domain may be a critical cytoplasmic target for the post-transcriptional regulation of this important transporter. Construction of Chimeric and Mutant cDNAs—For the purpose of constructing chimeric cDNAs between mouse KCC4 and human KCC2, we generated a number of silent restriction sites in the relevant cDNA constructs, all in the Xenopus expression vector pGEMHE (3Mount D.B.

George A.L.J Gamba G. Mount D.B. Mol. Brain Res. 2002; 103: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The QuikChange mutagenesis system (Stratagene) was utilized for all of the mutations described herein; mutations were all confirmed by sequencing and subcloned back into the relevant expression constructs. To generate a silent EcoRI site within transmembrane domain 12 (TM12) of mouse KCC4 (codons 664-666), we utilized the sense primer 5′-GAGTGGGGGGATGGAATTCGAGGCCTGTCACTGAAT-3′ and antisense primer 5′-ATTCAGTGACAGGCCTCGAATTCCATCCCCCCACTC-3′. We generated a new AflII site within TM1 of KCC4 (codons 133-135), also adding an L133F mutation (the other four KCCs have phenylalanine at this position within TM1); this mutagenesis utilized the sense primer 5′-GCAGAACATCTTCGGTGTTATCCTTTTCTTAAGACTGACCTGGATT-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-AATCCAGGTCAGTCTTAAGAAAAGGATAACACCGAAGATGTTCTGC-3′. An alternative HpaI site within TM1 was generated in codons 140-142 of KCC4, using the primers 5′-GAACATCTTCGGTGTTATCCTTTTCCTGAGGTTAACCTGGATTG-3′ and 5′-CAATCCAGGTTAACCTCAGGAAAAGGATAACACCGAAGATGTTC-3′. A silent EcoRI site at the beginning of TM3 was then generated in this latter construct, at codons 196-197 of KCC4: the primers 5′-TTCGCTGGGGCCTGAATTCGGAGGTGCTGTTGGCC-3′ and 5′-GGCCAACAGCACCTCCGAATTCAGGCCCCAGCGAA-3′. We also generated two initial silent sites within the C terminus of KCC4. The primers 5′-AATGAGCGGGAGAGAGAGGCCCAATTGATTCATGACAG-3′ and 5′-ATGCAGTGTTCCTGTCATGAATCAATTGGGCCTCTCT-3′ were thus utilized to generate a silent MunI site in codons 951-952 of KCC4, whereas the primers 5′-AGGACCTGCAGATGTTCCTGTACCACCTTCGAATCAGTG-3′ and 5′-CTCGGCACTGATTCGAAGGTGGTACAGGAACATCTGCAG-3′ were used to generate a silent SfuI site in codons 902-904. Finally, a silent BglII site was generated in codons 914-916 of human KCC2 using the primers 5′-AGCAGCGTTCCCAGATCTTAAAACAGATGCATTTAACC-3′ and 5′-TTGGTTAAATGCATCTGTTTTAAGATCTGGGAACGCTGC-3′. Table 1 summarizes the various KCC4-KCC2 chimeras generated for this study. The junction points for these chimeras were generated within conserved segments, so as to maximize the likelihood that the chimeric cDNAs would be functional. These chimeras were all generated by PCR, using primers that incorporated restriction sites suitable for subcloning into the KCC4 or KCC2 backbone cDNA. Amplificons were generally subcloned into pCR2.1 by TA cloning (Invitrogen) followed by sequencing of the entire insert to verify the integrity of the DNA generated by PCR; fragments were then subcloned into the expression vectors using the relevant restriction enzymes, followed by sequence confirmation of insertion. For example, in the “K244” chimera, residues 1-138 of KCC4 were replaced by the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of KCC2. PCR amplification of the KCC2 template for this purpose utilized the sense primer 5′-TTACCCGGGCCACATGCTAAACAACCTGACGGACTGCGAGGACGGCGATGGGGGAGCCAACCCT-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-TCTTAAGAAGAGGATGACGCCAAAGA-3′, which incorporate XmaI and AflII sites, respectively. The resulting fragment was subcloned from pCR2.1 into the modified KCC4 construct, using XmaI (5′ multicloning site) and AflII (TM1).TABLE 1Nomenclature and composition of chimeric cDNAs Chimeric cDNAs were generated using PCR-dependent subcloning and a series of silent restriction sites built into the KCC2, KCC4, and K4UR2-B constructs. The K4SD-1/2/3 subdomain chimeras were constructed from the K4UR2-B chimeric cDNA, replacing KCC2 sequence in the chimera with that of KCC4; see text for details.ChimeraCommentKCC4 residuesaThe content of the KCC2 or KCC4 sequence is defined by the specific codons incorporated in the chimeric cDNAsKCC2 residuesaThe content of the KCC2 or KCC4 sequence is defined by the specific codons incorporated in the chimeric cDNAsK244N terminus of KCC2139–10831–117K442C terminus of KCC21–664645–1116K424-ATM1–TM12 of KCC21–132; 665–1083112–644K424-BTM1–TM2 of KCC21–140, 197–1083120–175K2UR4“Unique region” of KCC4935–10831–914K4UR2-AUnique region of KCC21–951; 1019–1083933–1051K4UR2-BUnique region of KCC21–902; 1058–1083883–1090K4SD-1Proximal 2/3rds of UR domain1–902; 974–1083883–999K4SD-2Distal 2/3rds of UR domain1–951; 1058–1083973–1090K4SD-3Distal 1/3rd of UR domain1–973; 1058–10831000–1090a The content of the KCC2 or KCC4 sequence is defined by the specific codons incorporated in the chimeric cDNAs Open table in a new tab In the “K442” chimera, residues 665-1083 of KCC4, were replaced with the entire C terminus of KCC2, using the engineered EcoRI site in TM12 (see above) and an XbaI site in the 3′-multicloning site. Parts of the central core of hydrophobic domains in KCC4 were also substituted with KCC2 in two “K424” chimeras. In the K424-A chimera, residues 133-664 of KCC4 (TM1-12, see Table 1) were replaced by KCC2 using the engineered AflII and EcoRI sites in TM1 and TM12. To generate a chimera in which TM1-2 of KCC4 were replaced by the (divergent) sequence of KCC2 (K424-B), we replaced codons 141-196 by KCC2, using the engineered HpaI and EcoRI sites in TM1 and just before TM3 (see above). Sequence comparison of the mammalian KCCs indicates that KCC2 contains an expanded domain of ∼100 amino acids, rich in prolines and charged amino acids (2Payne J.A. Stevenson T.J. Donaldson L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16245-16252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 9Song L. Mercado A. Desai R. George A.L.J Gamba G. Mount D.B. Mol. Brain Res. 2002; 103: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In the two “K4UR2” chimeras, this “unique region” within the C terminus of KCC2 was substituted for the equivalent region of KCC4, with varying amounts of surrounding sequence. Thus in the K4UR2-A chimera, residues 952-1018 of KCC4 were replaced with residues 933-1051 of KCC2 by PCR-based subcloning, using the silent C-terminal MunI site (see above) and an existing NsiI site in KCC4. In the K4UR2-B chimera, residues 903-1057 of KCC4 were replaced with residues 883-1090 of KCC2, using the silent C-terminal SfuI site (see above) and an existing XhoI site in KCC4. The corresponding “K2UR4” chimera was generated as well, replacing residues 915-1116 of KCC2 with residues 935-1083 of KCC4; this construct utilized the engineered BglII site (see above) and an XbaI site in the 3′-multicloning site of KCC2. Finally, a third generation of KCC4-KCC2 chimeras was generated to refine the localization of the sequence that conferred isotonic transport, using the K4UR2-B chimera as the starting point. For this purpose, an existing BamHI site, corresponding to codons 437-438 of KCC4, was inactivated in K4UR2-B by mutagenesis. A new silent BamHI site (see Fig. 2A) was then generated in K4UR2-B, at codons 1019-1022 of the hybrid open reading frame, using the primers 5′-AAGGGGAGACGGATCCGGAGAAGGTGCATCTCA-3′ and 5′-TGAGATGCACCTTCTCCGGATCCGTCTCCCCTT-3′. An upstream MunI site was then added to this construct, using the primers 5′-AGAGGAGGAGGTGCAATTGATCCACGATCAGAGTGC-3′ and 5′-GAGCACTCTGATCGTGGATCAATTGCACCTCCTCCTC-3′. Three “subdomain” chimeras were then generated, using PCR-based subcloning to revert sections of the KCC2 sequence in the K4UR2-B chimera to that of KCC4; see also Table 1 and Fig. 2B. In the K4SD-1 chimera, the region between the BamHI and XhoI sites was replaced by KCC4, thus retaining the proximal two-thirds of the unique region and both PEST domains. In the K4SD-2 chimera the region between the SfuI and MunI sites was replaced by KCC4, removing the first PEST domain and retaining the distal two-thirds of the unique region. Finally, in the K4SD-3 chimera, the region between the SfuI and BamHI sites was replaced by KCC4, retaining the distal one-third of the unique region of KCC2 (Fig. 2). To prepare cRNA for injection, cDNA constructs were linearized at the 3′ end using NheI, and cRNA was transcribed in vitro, using the T7 RNA polymerase mMESSAGE kit (Ambion). RNA integrity was confirmed on agarose gels, and concentration was determined by absorbance reading at 260 nm. cRNA was stored frozen in aliquots at -80 °C until used. Preparation of Xenopus laevis Oocytes—Adult female X. laevis frogs were purchased from NASCO (Fort Atkinson, MI) and maintained in a Marine Biotech XR3 system (New Bedford, MA) under controlled light conditions at a water temperature of 16 °C.

In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, MAPK Pmk1/Spm1 has been involved in cell wall construction, morphogenesis, cytokinesis, and ion homeostasis, as part of the so-called cell integrity pathway together with MAPK kinase kinase Mkh1 and MAPK kinase Pek1. We show that Pmk1 is activated in multiple stress situations, including hyper- or hypotonic stress, glucose deprivation, presence of cell wall-damaging compounds, and oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide or pro-oxidants. The stress-induced activation of Pmk1 was completely dependent on Mkh1 and Pek1 function, supporting a nonbranched pathway in the regulation of MAPK activation. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that Mkh1, Pek1, and Pmp1 (a protein phosphatase that inactivates Pmk1) are cytoplasmic proteins. Mkh1 and Pek1 were also found at the septum, whereas Pmk1 localized in both cytoplasm and nucleus as well as in the mitotic spindle and septum during cytokinesis. Interestingly, Pmk1 subcellular localization was unaffected by stress or the absence of Mkh1 and Pek1, suggesting that its activation by the Mkh1-Pek1 cascade takes place at the cytoplasm and/or septum and that the active and inactive forms of this kinase cross the nuclear membrane. Cdc42 GTPase and its effectors, p21-activated kinases Pak2 and Pak1, are not upstream elements controlling the basal level or the stress-induced activation of Pmk1. However, Sty1 MAPK was essential for proper Pmk1 deactivation after hypertonic stress in a process regulated by Atf1 transcription factor. These results provide the first evidence for the existence of cross-talk between two MAPK cascades during the stress response in fission yeast.

The basic architecture of each functional cascade is composed of three sequentially acting protein kinases that become activated in response to triggering signals; the MAPK kinase kinases (MAPKKKs) phosphorylate and activate MAPK kinases (MAPKKs), which in turn phosphorylate and activate MAPKs (1Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar, 2Waskiewicz A.J. Cooper J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Among other actions, the effector MAPKs control the activity of transcription factors either directly or indirectly. Thus, activation by specific stimuli of MAPK signal transduction pathways is accompanied by changes in gene expression that play a crucial adaptive role in the adjustment of cells to environmental conditions. In contrast to the six or more MAPK cascades present in budding yeast (3Hohmann S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 300-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar), three distinct MAPK signaling cascades have been so far identified in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. These include the mating pheromone-responsive MAPK pathway and the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) pathway, whose central elements are MAPKs Spk1 and Sty1/Spc1, respectively (4Shiozaki K. Russell P. Nature. 1995; 378: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 5Toda T. Shimanuki M. Yanagida M. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 60-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). A third pathway, known as the cell integrity pathway, consists of a MAPK cascade composed by MAPKKK Mkh1 (6Sengar A.S. Markley N.A. Marini N.J. Young D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3508-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), MAPKK Pek1/Shk1 (7Loewith R. Hubberstey A. Young D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 153-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Sugiura R.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1318-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These and other results suggest that this pathway is involved in cell wall construction, morphogenesis, cytokinesis, and ion homeostasis in fission yeast (6Sengar A.S. Markley N.A. Marini N.J. Young D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3508-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 7Loewith R. Hubberstey A. Young D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 153-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Sugiura R.

Pmk1/Spm1 MAPK was independently characterized by two laboratories as a structural homolog of the budding yeast Mpk1/Slt2 MAPK (9Toda T. Dhut S. Superti-Furga G. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Sugiura R. Kuno T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6752-6764Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 10Zaitsevskaya-Carter T. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1318-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Later work identified Mkh1 and Pek1 as the respective MAPKKK and MAPKK components of the pathway (6Sengar A.S. Markley N.A. Marini N.J. Young D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3508-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 7Loewith R. Hubberstey A. Young D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 153-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Sugiura R. Toda T. Dhut S. Shuntoh H. Kuno T. Nature. 1999; 399: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In fact, yeast two-hybrid experiments indicate that Mkh1, Pek1, and Pmk1 physically interact to form a ternary complex (7Loewith R. Hubberstey A. Young D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 153-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pmk1 MAPK is a 48-kDa protein that can be dually phosphorylated by Pek1 at two conserved threonine and tyrosine amino acid residues in positions 186 and 188 (consensus sequence TEY) (8Sugiura R. Toda T. Dhut S. Shuntoh H. Kuno T. Nature. 1999; 399: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Moreover, conclusive evidence indicates that inactive (unphosphorylated) Pek1 binds Pmk1 and acts as a potent inhibitor of Pmk1 signaling in the absence of a triggering stimulus (8Sugiura R. Toda T. Dhut S. Shuntoh H. Kuno T. Nature. 1999; 399: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Pmp1 phosphatase is able to dephosphorylate Pmk1, suggesting that this phosphatase may negatively regulate the Pmk1 MAPK pathway (11Sugiura R. Toda T. Shuntoh H. Yanagida M. Kuno T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The Pmk1 signal transduction pathway seems closely related to the Mpk1/Slt2 cell integrity pathway of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (3Hohmann S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 300-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar). However, whereas Mpk1/Slt2 is activated by phosphorylation in response to elevated temperatures, cell wall-damaging compounds, or oxidative agents (12Martín H. Rodriguez-Pachon J.M. Ruiz C. Nombela C. Molina M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1511-1519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 13Vilella F. Herrero E. Torres J. de la Torre-Ruiz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9149-9159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), S. pombe Pmk1 becomes activated only by high temperatures or sodium chloride (10Zaitsevskaya-Carter T. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1318-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Besides, the MAPK activation domain in Pmk1 is homolog to that present in extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) (p42/p44) of animal cells, which become strongly activated in response to growth factors, phorbol esters, and, to a lesser extent, cytokines or osmotic stress (14Roux P.P. Blenis J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 320-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar). A common feature of the signaling pathways is the nuclear translocation of MAPKs as a critical step for their biological function at the transcriptional level. However, this process varies among different eukaryotic organisms. Whereas mammalian ERKs translocate from the cytoplasm to the cell nucleus upon stimulation by growth factors (14Roux P.P. Blenis J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 320-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar), budding yeast Slt2 constitutively shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (15van Drogen F. Peter M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1698-1703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Similar to ERKs, fission yeast Sty1 is mainly cytoplasmic in unstressed cells but translocates into the cell nucleus upon phosphorylation (16Gaits F. Degols G. Shiozaki K. Russell P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1464-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The mechanisms responsible for the activation of the cell integrity MAPK cascade in S. pombe and the elements involved downstream from Pmk1 are poorly understood. Recent evidence supports a potential interaction between Pak2 and Mkh1 MAPKKK (17Merla A. Johnson D.I. Curr. Genet. 2001; 39: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Pak2/Shk2, a p21-activated kinase (PAK kinase), is an effector of the Cdc42 GTPase, which plays a key role in the establishment of cell polarity in fission yeast (18Sells M.A. Barratt J.T. Caviston J. Ottilie S. Leberer E. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18490-18498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 19Yang P. Kansra S. Pimental R.A. Gilbreth M. Marcus S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18481-18489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Pak2 associates with Mkh1 MAPKKK by a two-hybrid system, and overexpression of its catalytic domain is lethal in wild type cells of the fission yeast but not in mutants disrupted in mkh1+ or pmk1+ (17Merla A. Johnson D.I. Curr. Genet. 2001; 39: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This suggests that Cdc42 might interact with Pak2 to signal through the Mkh1-Pek1-Pmk1 pathway (17Merla A. Johnson D.I. Curr. Genet. 2001; 39: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A functional linkage between the Pmk1 MAPK pathway and the protein kinase C homologs Pck1 and Pck2 has been also proposed, but it is unclear whether these elements act upstream of the Pmk1 pathway or synergistically regulate independent aspects of cell integrity (6Sengar A.S. Markley N.A. Marini N.J. Young D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3508-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 9Toda T. Dhut S. Superti-Furga G. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Sugiura R. Kuno T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6752-6764Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Despite detailed knowledge of signaling through other MAPK modules found in yeast cells, various functional aspects of the Pmk1 MAPK pathway in S. pombe have received comparatively less attention. In particular, it remains to be determined which kind of signals or extracellular conditions, other than heat shock or osmostress, can activate the Pmk1 MAPK pathway. Moreover, studies on the degree of insulation of the Pmk1 MAPK pathway and the subcellular location of its main components are lacking. In this work, we address some of the above questions to show that in S. pombe the Pmk1 MAPK pathway responds against a wide variety stresses, including the presence of cell wall-damaging compounds or oxidative conditions. We also demonstrate that Pmk1 MAPK may be found in the cytoplasm and nucleus, whereas Mhk1 MAPKKK, Pek1 MAPKK, and Pmp1 phosphatase are cytoplasmic proteins. Notably, Mkh1, Pek1, and Pmk1 locate at the septum during cell separation. In addition, our approach reveals that the stress-induced activation of the Pmk1 MAPK pathway is partially regulated by the SAPK pathway through Sty1 and that Cdc42 and Pak2 do not act as upstream elements in this cascade. Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—The S. pombe strains (Table 1) were routinely grown with shaking at 28 °C in YES or EMM2 medium (20Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3148) Google Scholar) with 3% glucose. Culture media were supplemented with adenine, leucine, histidine, or uracil (100 mg/liter; Sigma), depending on the requirements for each particular strain. Transformation of yeast strains was performed by the lithium acetate method as described elsewhere (21Soto T. Beltrán F.F. Paredes V. Madrid M. Millar J.B.A. Vicente-Soler J. Cansado J. Gacto M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1-10Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Plasmids pREP41X-HA6H-cdc42(G12V) and pREP41X-GST-cdc42 (T17N) express, respectively, a hyperactive and a dominant negative allele of Cdc42 fused to HA and GST under the control of the attenuated variant (41X) of the thiamine-repressible promoter nmt1 (22Forsburg S.L. Sherman D.A. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 191: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Mutant strains were obtained by standard transformation procedures or by mating and selecting diploids in EMM2 medium without supplements. Spores were obtained in MEL medium (20Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3148) Google Scholar), purified by glusulase treatment (21Soto T. Beltrán F.F. Paredes V. Madrid M. Millar J.B.A. Vicente-Soler J.

Wu J.Q. Longtine M.S. Shah N.G. McKenzie III, A. Steever A.B. Wach A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). Primer sequences used in each case (80–100 bp in length) are available upon request. The Pmk1-HA6H-tagged strains MI200 and MI201 were obtained as follows. A 5′-truncated version of the pmk1+ ORF was amplified by PCR employing ACCACTCGAGATCGCATCTGCTTGA as 5′-oligonucleotide (which hybridizes at positions +125 to +139 in the pmk1+ ORF and contains an XhoI site) and the 3′-oligonucleotide ACCATGCGGCCGCGGTTATGGCGATTAC (which hybridizes at the 3′-end of the pmk1+ ORF and incorporates a NotI site placed immediately upstream of the TAA stop codon). Restriction sites in both oligonucleotides are italicized. PCR amplification employing the Expand high fidelity system (Roche Applied Science) generated a 1.6-kbp fragment that was cleaved with XhoI and NotI and cloned into integrative plasmid pIH-ura, which allows HA6H tag fusions at the C terminus (24Paredes V. Franco A. Madrid M. Soto T. Vicente-Soler J. Gacto M. Cansado J. Yeast. 2004; 21: 593-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid (pIH-Pmk1-ura) was digested at the unique BstXI site within the pmk1+ coding region (position 1428), and the linear fragment was transformed into haploid strains MM1 and MM2 to target integration at the pmk1+ locus. Uracil prototrophs were selected, and the identification of strains MI200 and MI201 with one copy of pmk1-HA6H expressed from the genomic pmk1+ promoter was verified by Southern blot analysis and immunoblot of whole-cell extracts with anti-HA antibody (see below). To obtain strain MI301, which expresses a C-terminal tagged version of Pmk1 fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP), a DNA fragment with the pmk1+ ORF plus regulatory sequences was amplified by PCR employing the 5′-oligonucleotide PMKGF-5 (CCTTATCTAGATTTCTCATTGCCGCTTC, which hybridizes at positions 313–330 upstream of the pmk1+ ATG start codon and contains an XbaI site) and the 3′-oligonucleotide PMKGF-3 (CCTTAGGATCCTTATGGCGATTATCATC, which hybridizes at the 3′-end of pmk1+ ORF and incorporates a BamHI site placed immediately upstream of the TAA stop codon). PCR amplification generated a 2.1-kbp fragment that was cleaved with XbaI and BamHI and cloned into integrative plasmid pIL-GFP to construct C-terminal fusions with the GFP tag and containing the S. pombe leu1+ gene as a selectable marker. The resulting plasmid (pIL-pmk1-GFP) was digested at the unique NruI site within leu1+, and the linear fragment was transformed into pmk1+-disrupted strain TP319-13c. leu1+ transformants were obtained, and the correct integration of the pmk1-GFP fusion plus regulatory sequences was verified as above. Additionally, pmk1+, pek1+, mkh1+, and pmp1+ were tagged in their chromosomal loci at their 3′-ends with GFP by employing plasmid pFA6a-GFP(S65T)-kanMX6 as template and the same PCR-mediated strategy used for gene disruption (23Bahler J.

Stress Treatments—Most experiments to investigate Pmk1 activation under stress were performed using log phase cell cultures (A600 of 0.5) growing at 28 °C in YES medium and the appropriate stress treatment. In glucose deprivation studies, cells were grown in YES medium with 7% glucose to an A600 of 0.5 (actual glucose concentration = 6%, determined by the glucose oxidase method), recovered by filtration, and resuspended in the same medium without glucose but osmotically equilibrated with 3% glycerol (25Madrid M.

Hypotonic treatment was achieved by growth of cells in YES medium plus 0.8 m sorbitol and transfer to the same medium without polyol. To monitor Pmk1 activation in strains bearing the orb2-34 allele, cultures were grown in YES medium to an A600 of 0.2, shifted to 37 °C for 3 h, allowed to recover for 30 min at 28 °C, and then subjected to the adequate treatment. In overexpression experiments, cells were first grown in EMM2 medium plus 10 μm thiamine, washed three times, and reinoculated into fresh medium (with or without thiamine) for about 20 h at 28 °C prior to the activating compound. At different times, 30 ml of culture were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C, the cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline buffer, and the yeast pellets were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for analysis. Under these conditions, neither activation of Pmk1 nor the previously described Sty1 phosphorylation induced by centrifugation at room temperature was observed in unstressed cells (25Madrid M. Soto T. Franco A. Paredes V. Vicente J. Hidalgo E. Gacto M. Cansado J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41594-41602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Purification and Detection of Activated Pmk1-HA6H and Sty1-HA6H following Different Stresses—Cell homogenates were prepared under native conditions employing chilled acid-washed glass beads and lysis buffer (10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, plus specific protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures for fungal and yeast extracts) (Sigma). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min, and HA6H-tagged Pmk1 or Sty1 was purified by using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen Inc.) (21Soto T. Beltrán F.F. Paredes V. Madrid M. Millar J.B.A. Vicente-Soler J. Cansado J. Gacto M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1-10Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The purified proteins were resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Amersham Biosciences), and incubated with either monoclonal mouse anti-HA (clone 12CA5; Roche Applied Science), polyclonal rabbit anti-phospho-p42/44 antibodies (Cell Signaling) (7Loewith R.

Millar J.B.A. Vicente-Soler J. Cansado J. Gacto M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1-10Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The immunoreactive bands were revealed with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) and the Supersignal System (Pierce). Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—For immunoprecipitation of proteins interacting with Pmk1-HA6H, cell extracts were incubated for 12 h at 4 °C with monoclonal anti-HA antibody (12CA5), and the immunocomplexes were adsorbed overnight at 4 °C with protein A-agarose (Roche Applied Science). After extensive washing, the complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and hybridized separately with anti-HA, anti-phospho-p44/42, or a monoclonal mouse anti-GFP antibody (clones 7.1 and 13.1; Roche Applied Science). The immunoreactive bands were revealed as indicated above. Fluorescence Microscopy—Images were observed on a Leica DM 4000B fluorescence microscope with a 100× objective, captured with a cooled Leica DC 300F camera and IM50 software, and then imported into Adobe PhotoShop 6.0 (Adobe Systems). Alternatively, fluorescence microscopy was performed on a Deltavision microscope containing a photometrics CH350L liquid-cooled CCD camera and an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope with a ×100 objective equipped with a Deltavision data collection system (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA). To localize Pmk1-GFP, Pek1-GFP, Mkh1-GFP, and Pmp1-GFP fusions, cells grown in YES medium to an A600 of 0.2 were subjected to different stress treatments, and the cells of small aliquots (10 μl) were loaded onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides or fixed with formaldehyde as described (26Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J. Mcleod M. Warbrick E. Experiments with Fission Yeast: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993Google Scholar). 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and Calcofluor white were employed for nuclear and cell wall/septum staining, respectively (26Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J. Mcleod M. Warbrick E. Experiments with Fission Yeast: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993Google Scholar). Plate Assay of Stress Sensitivity for Growth—Wild type and mutant strains of S. pombe were grown in YES liquid medium to log phase. Appropriate dilutions were spotted in duplicate on YES solid medium containing 2% (w/v) bacto-agar (Difco) and supplemented with the indicated compounds. Incubation was either at 28 °C for 3 days or at 37 °C for 2 days. Pmk1 Activation following Different Stresses—Exponentially growing cultures of strain MI200, which harbors a genomic copy of pmk1+ tagged with HA6H, were subjected to different environmental stimuli. The purified Pmk1-HA6H fusion was then assayed by Western blotting with a polyclonal anti-phospho-p42/44 antibody to detect phosphorylation/activation of Pmk1 protein"

Transcripts encoding splice variants of human survivin have been described and their expression correlated with cancer progression. As survivin forms homodimers in vitro, it has been suggested that these isoforms could interfere with wild type function by forming heterodimers. Here we show that survivin-2β and survivin-δEx3 can interact with wild type survivin but have reduced affinity for the partner protein of survivin, borealin, and thus do not localize with the chromosomal passenger complex in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that overexpression of survivin-2β-green fluorescent protein (GFP) or survivin-δEx3-GFP does not impede cell cycle progression. We also report that wild type survivin, but not survivin-2β-GFP or survivin-δEx3-GFP, can rescue cell proliferation inhibited by small interfering RNA-mediated survivin depletion. These data suggest that, despite their ability to interact with wild type survivin, neither of these isoforms acts as its competitor during mitosis nor has an essential function.

These data suggest that, despite their ability to interact with wild type survivin, neither of these isoforms acts as its competitor during mitosis nor has an essential function. Survivin is a 16.5-kDa protein, which is essentially comprised of an NH2-terminal BIR domain typical of anti-apoptotic proteins, and a COOH-terminal amphipathic α-helical coil. In vitro it crystallizes as a dimer, and this interaction is thought to be mediated through two hydrophobic regions, one in its extreme NH2 terminus, amino acids 6-10, and the second in the “linker” region, amino acids 89-102, between the BIR domain and the COOH-terminal helix (1Chantalat L.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As its name infers, survivin is cytoprotective, but it also has a more fundamental role as an essential cell division protein, see (4Wheatley S.P. McNeish I.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2005; 247: 35-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In addition to forming homodimers, survivin interacts directly with the chromosomal passenger proteins, aurora-B kinase, borealin, and INCENP in vitro (5Wheatley S.P. Carvalho A. Vagnarelli P. Earnshaw W.C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 886-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 6Wheatley S.P. Henzing A.J. Dodson H. Khaled W. Earnshaw W.C. J. Biol.

Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 179-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). These proteins are mutually dependent upon each other, and together they form a complex during mitosis, the chromosomal passenger complex, which is required for chromosome movements, proper spindle checkpoint control, and cell division (reviewed in Ref. 8Vagnarelli P. Earnshaw W.C. Chromosoma. 2004; 113: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Four splice variants of human survivin have been described, survivin-2α, survivin-2β, survivin-δ-Ex3, and survivin-3β (9Mahotka C. Wenzel M. Springer E. Gabbert H.E. Gerharz C.D. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6097-6102PubMed Google Scholar, 10Mahotka C. Liebmann J. Wenzel M. Suschek C.V. Schmitt M. Gabbert H.E. Gerharz C.D.

While survivin-2α and survivin-3β are predicted to be truncated forms of 128 and 120 amino acids, respectively, survivin-2β and survivin-δ-Ex3 both result from alternative splicing at the interface between exons 2 and 3. Survivin-2β has an additional exon of 23 amino acids, exon 2β, inserted in its BIR domain, which is predicted to alter its tertiary structure and thus to affect its anti-apoptotic function. Survivin-δEx3 omits exon 3 causing a frameshift that results in a COOH terminus with no homology to wild type survivin (10Mahotka C. Liebmann J. Wenzel M. Suschek C.V. Schmitt M. Gabbert H.E. Gerharz C.D. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 1334-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). These differences have led to the suggestion that survivin-2β and survivin-δEx3 may antagonise wild type survivin by forming heterodimers with reduced capabilities (13Krieg A. Mahotka C. Krieg T. Grabsch H. Muller W. Takeno S. Suschek C.V. Heydthausen M. Gabbert H.E. Gerharz C.D. Br. J. Cancer. 2002; 86: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Indeed, when induced to undergo apoptosis, it has been reported that cells transfected with survivin-2β have decreased viability over cells transfected with wild type survivin (14Caldas H. Jiang Y. Holloway M.P. Fangusaro J. Mahotka C. Altura R.A. Conway E.M. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1994-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, to date there is only indirect evidence that heterodimers can form between these isoforms and wild type survivin (14Caldas H. Jiang Y. Holloway M.P. Fangusaro J. Mahotka C. Altura R.A. Conway E.M. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1994-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The presence of transcripts of survivin isoforms has been correlated with cancer progression. For example, using reverse transcription PCR Mahotka et al. (9Mahotka C. Wenzel M. Springer E. Gabbert H.E. Gerharz C.D. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6097-6102PubMed Google Scholar) found that wild type survivin and survivin-δ Ex3 were expressed in cell lines derived from renal carcinomas but not from normal renal cells. Differential expression of survivin-2β was also reported in gastric carcinomas and, in this case, negatively correlated with disease progression (13Krieg A. Mahotka C. Krieg T. Grabsch H. Muller W. Takeno S. Suschek C.V. Heydthausen M. Gabbert H.E. Gerharz C.D. Br. J. Cancer. 2002; 86: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 15Meng H. Lu C. Mabuchi H. Tanigawa N. Cancer Lett. 2004; 216: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Further reports have linked the expression of survivin isoforms with poor patient prognosis (for review, see Ref. 16Li F. Br. J. Cancer. 2004; 92: 212-216Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Notably, however, with the exception of one recent study (14Caldas H. Jiang Y. Holloway M.P. Fangusaro J. Mahotka C. Altura R.A. Conway E.M. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1994-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), the only description of survivin isoforms at the protein level has come from expression of tagged versions, which have revealed that survivin-2β-GFP is cytoplasmic throughout the cell cycle, while survivin-δEx3-GFP is nuclear during interphase and diffusely localized in mitosis (10Mahotka C. Liebmann J. Wenzel M. Suschek C.V. Schmitt M. Gabbert H.E. Gerharz C.D. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 1334-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 14Caldas H. Jiang Y. Holloway M.P. Fangusaro J. Mahotka C. Altura R.A. Conway E.M. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1994-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrate that survivin-2β and survivin-δEx3 can interact directly with wild type survivin in vitro. Despite these abilities, however, neither survivin-2β-GFP nor survivin-δEx3-GFP co-immunoprecipitate or co-localize with endogenous survivin, or the other chromosomal passengers during mitosis. We provide evidence that their differential localization may be due to their altered affinity for borealin. Furthermore, we report that these proteins are present at very low levels in cycling HeLa and U2OS cells and that their overexpression does not interfere with cell proliferation under our experimental conditions. Finally, we reveal that cDNA to wild type survivin, and only wild type survivin, can compensate for depletion of all forms of survivin by siRNA, indicating that these isoforms do not play a vital role in cell division and cannot compensate for loss of the wild type protein. Thus we conclude that the presence or absence of survivin-2β or survivin-δEx3 within cultured HeLa or U2OS cells is irrelevant to cell proliferation. PCR and Cloning Isoforms—To extract mRNA, exponentially growing cells were lysed in TRIzol (Invitrogen) and treated with chloroform (2 min) to remove lipids. After centrifuging (13,000 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C), the aqueous phase was removed and nucleic acids precipitated with ice-cold isopropyl alcohol. RNA was pelleted, washed with 70% ethanol, and re-suspended in RNase-free, diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water (Ambion) before incubation at 60 °C (5 min). Samples were then incubated in DNase (Ambion) for 1 h at 37 °C. After DNase inactivation, 5 μg of RNA sample was combined with 500 ng of oligo(dT) (New England Biolabs) and incubated at 70 °C for 15 min. Samples were cooled and then incubated with 100 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm dNTP, 1 × 1st strand (42 °C, 1 h) and then 70 °C for 15 min. cDNA was amplified by PCR using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) and cloned into the appropriate vectors. Real-time PCR was performed using QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and analyzed on an ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The common forward primer was GAC CAC CGC ATC TCT ACA TTC, and reverse primers were TGC TTT TTA TGT TCC TCT ATG GG (wild type survivin), AAG TGC TGG TAT TAC AGG CGT (survivin-2β), and ATT GTT GGT TTC CTT TGC ATG (survivin-δ Ex3).

Tissue Culture, Transient Transfections, and Stable Cell Lines—U2OS and HeLa cells were maintained at 37 °C, with 5% CO2, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin-streptomycin, and fungizome. Transfections were carried out with the indicated pcDNA3.1 constructs using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) and stable cell lines generated by transfection followed by selection with G418 (500 μg/ml). Prior to analysis, GFP-positive cells were sorted using an LSRII fluorescence-activated cell sorter (BD Bioscience) to ensure a homogeneous population. Tissue culture reagents were from Invitrogen unless otherwise stated. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Whole cell extracts and immunoprecipitations were carried out on colcemid (0.5 ng/ml, 16 h; Sigma)-treated cells arrested in mitosis. Approximately 5 × 105 cell equivalents were loaded per lane for whole cell extracts and 3 × 106 cell equivalents per lane for immunoprecipitation, except where indicated. SDS-PAGE analysis and immunoblotting were carried out using normal procedures, with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Dako) and chemiluminescent reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Signals were analyzed by exposure to Hyperfilm (Eastman Kodak Co.) or using a PhosphorImager (Storm 480 Phosphorimager, Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation, whole cell extracts were prepared by incubation for 20 min at 4 °C in RIPA-benzonase buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8), 137 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholate, plus protease inhibitors), with 25 units of benzonase and 2 mm MgCl2, and incubated with a mixture of anti-GFP antibodies (3E1, Cancer Research-UK and 3E6, Molecular Probes), for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation, then with protein G beads (Cancer Research-UK) for 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were centrifuged and washed sequentially in wash I (50 mm Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40), wash II (50 mm Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), and wash III (50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA), then boiled in 5 × sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Isoform-specific Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits by AbCam against the following peptide sequences: C-SWLPWIEASGRS (survivin-δ Ex3) and CNTSTLGGRGGRITR (survivin-2β). Antibodies were affinity-purified against the peptides and stored at -20 °C. These antibodies are now available from AbCam (www.abcam.com). Microscopy—Cells were prepared for fluorescence microscopy using standard protocols. Briefly cells were washed with PBS, fixed for 5 min at 37 °C with 4% paraformaldehyde and extracted with 0.2% Triton in PBS (2 min, 37 °C). Samples were then washed with PBS, blocked with PBS containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for a minimum of 15 min, and immunoprobed sequentially with the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies for 1 h (room temperature). Primary antibodies were polyclonal anti-survivin-δEx3 (1/50, rabbit; now available from AbCam), polyclonal anti-survivin-2β (1/50, rabbit; now available from AbCam), monoclonal anti-aurora-B kinase (1/250, mouse; Transduction Laboratories), and monoclonal anti-tubulin (1/2000; B512, Sigma). Secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories) were used at 1/200. Samples were mounted in Vectashield containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and viewed using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope or Zeiss Axioplan II. Growth Curves and FACS Analysis—Cell proliferation was assessed by trypan blue exclusion (Sigma) using a hemocytometer. For FACS analysis cells were pelleted at 750 rpm for 5 min at room temperature, washed in PBS, then fixed for 1 h in 1% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C. Cells were then repelleted, washed in PBS, and resuspended in 500 μl of propidium iodide solution (PI; Sigma) containing 40 μg/ml PI and 100 μg/ml RNase A (MP Biomedicals Ltd. UK) in PBS. Cells were then passed through a 70-μm cell strainer (Falcon) into a 2058 tube (Falcon) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min before analysis on an LSRII fluorescence-activated cell sorter (BD Bioscience). Cells were initially analyzed by forward scatter versus side scatter to differentiate between live cells and cell debris. The live cell population was selected for by gate P1. P1-gated cells were plotted as PI-width versus PI-area to establish nuclear size. Gate P2 selected for single cells with increased PI intensity, and cell doublets were excluded. Cells from the P2 population were then plotted versus GFP-A. Gate P3 was selected for GFP-negative cells (established using a GFP-negative cell line), and gate P4 was selected for GFP-positive cells. To determine the DNA content of the P4 population, PI-A was plotted against the number of cells counted for each cell line. RNA Interference and Complementation—The RNAi target domain, bases 45-65, within the survivin cDNA sequence was selected as it was common to all human survivin isoforms; hence it should eliminate all splice variants (17Carvalho A. Carmena M. Sambade C. Earnshaw W.C. Wheatley S.P. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2987-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Using site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) guanine 54 was substituted for cytosine, thus creating a “wobble” in the RNAi target domain, allowing us to generate isoform specific constructs resistant to “knock down”. These constructs were cloned into the expression vector, pcDNA3.1, and introduced into human cells as described above. RNAi was carried out using 60 pmol of double-stranded RNA per reaction and Oligofectamine as described in Ref. 17Carvalho A. Carmena M. Sambade C. Earnshaw W.C. Wheatley S.P. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2987-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar or 1.5 μl of siPORT NeoFx (Ambion) in 24-well plates with 4 × 104 cells/well. Survivin Isoforms Can Interact Directly with Wild Type Survivin but Have Reduced Affinity for Borealin—To determine whether survivin-2β or survivin-δEx3 can interact directly with survivin in vitro, we incubated 35S-labeled, in vitro translated wild type survivin, survivin-2β or survivin-δEx3, with GST or GST-survivin bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. In this assay both isoforms bound to GST-survivin (Fig. 1A, middle panel), albeit survivin-δEx3 bound far less efficiently (∼3-fold) than wild type survivin. These data suggest that survivin isoforms can form heterodimers with wild type survivin. Similar interactions were also detected using yeast two hybrid pairwise interactions. 7S. Tate, P. K. Ferrigno, and S. P. Wheatley, unpublished observations. Interactions of similar intensity were also seen between GST-auorora-B and survivin and GST-aurora-B and the isoforms (Fig. 1A, right panel). Next we investigated the affinities of the isoforms for GST-borealin (Fig. 1B). An intense interaction between GST-borealin and wild type survivin was observed, a comparatively weak interaction was seen between GST-borealin and survivin-2β, and no interaction was observed between GST-borealin and survivin-δEx3. To determine whether these proteins have the potential to interact within the physiological milieu, we generated cell lines stably expressing GFP, survivin-GFP, survivin-2β-GFP, and survivin-δEx3-GFP (see below) from the cytomegalovirus promoter. These lines were transiently transfected with aurora-B, borealin, or survivin, then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP antibodies (Fig. 2). Using this overexpression method we found that wild type survivin and survivin-2β, but not survivin-δEx3, could immunoprecipitate aurora-B, borealin, and wild type survivin. Expression of Survivin Isoforms—Reverse transcription PCR performed on four human cancer cell lines, HeLa, U2OS, MCF7, and HT29, revealed three mRNA transcripts corresponding to survivin in each cell type (Fig. 3A). Sequence analysis verified that in each case the predominant band was wild type survivin, while the additional bands above and below the major band were survivin-2β and survivin-δEx3, respectively (data not shown). The signal intensity from the isoform bands varied from line to line. As reverse transcription PCR cannot be used reliably to compare the levels of mRNA expression in a sample, we next used real-time PCR to provide accurate quantitation of mRNA expression of these variants in the cell lines used in this study. As shown in Fig. 3B, real-time PCR revealed that wild type survivin was always the most abundant and survivin-δEx3 the least abundant form in HeLa and U2OS cells. To detect endogenous survivin isoforms at the protein level, antibodies were raised against the survivin-2β-specific peptide, CNTSTLGGRGGRITR, and a peptide within the COOH terminus of survivin-δEx3, COOH-SWLPWIEASGRS. Immunoblot analysis of recombinantly expressed GST-tagged versions of these proteins revealed that the antibodies specifically recognized the isoforms to which they were targetted and did not cross react with the other forms of survivin (Fig. 4, A and B). When tested on whole cell lysates from HeLa cells transiently transfected with GFP-tagged versions of the isoforms, the survivin-2β antibody recognized a band of the appropriate size for survivin-2β-GFP; however, it also highlighted a higher molecular weight band, circa 100 kDa, in both the untransfected and transfected lanes, indicating that it was not completely specific (Fig. 4C, asterisk). Affinity-purified antibodies to survivin-δEx3 appeared to be relatively specific revealing a single band in the transfected lane of ∼40 kDa (Fig. 4D). Despite the reactivity of the antibodies in immunoblots we were unable to detect endogenously expressed protein of either isoform from HeLa or U2OS cells using these antibodies (Fig. 4, E and F, lower panels). Furthermore, we used a commercial polyclonal-survivin antibody that recognizes epitopes present in wild type survivin, survivin-2β and survivin-δEx3, on whole cell extracts prepared from cells either untransfected or transfected with untagged survivin-2β (Fig. 4E) or survivin-δEx3 (Fig. 4F). In each case the untagged exogenously expressed isoform was readily detectable in the transfected extracts with this antibody; however, no corresponding band was observed in the untransfected cell lysates. Together these data suggest that the endogenous expression of the survivin isoforms in these cells is extremely low. Localization of Survivin Isoforms—It is possible that even very low levels of isoforms could interfere with wild type survivin function; therefore we asked whether localization of isoforms would support this. We used GFP tagging and immunofluorescence with the antibodies described above to detect and localize survivin-2β and survivin-δEx3 (Fig. 5). COOH-terminally tagged cDNA for each variant was transfected into HeLa or U2OS cells and observed 48 h later. Wild type survivin-GFP was found at the centromeres of prometaphase cells, and the midbody of cells executing cytokinesis, as reported previously (Fig. 5A). Using this method, survivin-2β-GFP was found diffuse throughout the cytoplasm at all stages of the cell cycle and was excluded from the mitotic chromosomes and interphase nuclei. Concentration of survivin-2β-GFP was noted at the very center of the midbody (Fig. 5B), in a pattern that was distinct from the bipartite midbody localization of wild type survivin-GFP (Fig. 5A). Examination of control cells revealed that GFP alone localizes to the very center of the midbody (Fig. 5D), suggesting that this localization is a GFP artifact rather than a specific localization of survivin-2β-GFP. Survivin-δEx3-GFP was also found diffusely localized in the cytoplasm and was excluded from the chromosomes in mitosis (Fig. 5C, upper panel). In interphase it was present in the nucleus, as indicated by the G1 cells in Fig. 5C (lower panel). Importantly, at no time did we see localization that corresponded to that of the wild type form as judged by immunostaining for aurora-B (Fig. 5, red panels). Furthermore, aurora-B localization was not disrupted by the overexpression of any of the survivin isoforms. The peptide-specific antibodies raised against survivin-2β also revealed that it was excluded from the mitotic chromosomes and rarely seen at the midbody. During interphase the signal was diffuse throughout the cytoplasm and absent from nuclei (data not shown). Additionally, using this polyclonal antibody a signal was detected at the centrosome throughout mitosis. However, this signal persisted after RNAi depletion (data not shown), indicating that it was due to a cross-reaction, possibly with the 100-kDa protein in Fig. 4C. Immunolocalization of survivin-δEx3 with the antibodies described in Fig. 4 showed a weak signal of diffuse cytoplasmic staining, exclusion from the chromosomes during mitosis, and no concentration at the midbody (data not shown). In interphase cells it was apparent in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Thus our immunohistological data confirm the localizations with GFP-tagged forms above. Survivin Isoforms Cannot Immunoprecipitate Endogenous Chromosomal Passenger Proteins—As shown in Fig. 2, survivin-2β-GFP was able to immunoprecipitate aurora-B, borealin, and survivin when they were overexpressed in the cell. Given that the localization of the isoforms is different from the chromosomal passenger proteins (Fig. 5), we next asked whether it could immunoprecipitate the endogenous forms of these proteins from whole cell extracts in vivo. Fig. 6 shows that only wild type survivin-GFP can interact with the endogenous chromosomal passenger complex, as judged by co-immunoprecipitation of aurora-B, borealin, and wild type survivin. Overexpression of Survivin Isoforms Does Not Impede Cell Proliferation—Compared with wild type survivin-GFP and survivin-δEx3-GFP, we encountered some difficulties in establishing the survivin-2β-GFP expressing lines, suggesting that it may be slightly cytotoxic. Nevertheless, once established, cell lines stably expressing survivin-GFP, survivin-2β-GFP, and survivin-δEx3-GFP grew with normal kinetics (Fig. 7A). These lines were subjected to FACS analysis to monitor DNA content (Fig. 7B). No change in distribution of 2N and 4N cells was observed, and no increase in ploidy (8N or 16N) was detected in any of the lines, as compared with a control GFP line, indicating that overexpression of these versions of survivin does not interfere with proliferation in these cell lines. Survivin Isoforms Cannot Complement for Loss of Wild Type Survivin—To assess whether the isoforms have an essential role in mitosis, we carried out RNAi complementation experiments. The RNAi target sequence, bases 45-65, was selected as it is present in all known splice variants of human survivin; hence its application should eliminate all known isoforms (17Carvalho A. Carmena M. Sambade C. Earnshaw W.C. Wheatley S.P. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2987-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The constructs used to generate the stable cell lines described above carried an additional silent mutation (C54G) within this siRNA target region to prevent their elimination, denoted (r) for resistant hereinafter. Immunoblot analysis verified that these constructs were indeed resistant to knock down and that the non-resistant (nr) cytomegalovirus promoted survivin-GFP could be efficiently eliminated from cells by 48 h post-transfection with survivin specific siRNA (Fig. 8A). Using these stable cell lines we asked whether the exogenously expressed proteins could complement for loss of endogenous survivin by RNAi. As indicated in Fig. 8, B and D, in a control population expressing survivin-GFP, cell proliferation ceased 48 h after exposure to survivin specific double-stranded RNA. Introduction of a single cDNA encoding only wild type survivin(r)-GFP was sufficient to restore growth (Fig. 8, C and D). By contrast neither survivin(r)2β-GFP nor survivin(r)δEx3-GFP was able to complement for loss of survivin expression (Fig. 8D). A number of studies have suggested that the clinical outcome of some cancer sufferers can be correlated to the expression of mRNA of the survivin isoforms, survivin-2β and survivin-δEx3 (reviewed in Ref. 16Li F. Br. J. Cancer. 2004; 92: 212-216Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been speculated that the reason for this correlation could be due to competition by the isoforms to form dimers with the wild type protein. However, three questions have remained outstanding. First, whether they can form heterodimers; second, whether these forms exist as proteins within the cell; and third, whether they can interfere with the function of the wild type protein. This study addresses all of these questions. Survivin Isoforms Can Heterodimerise with the Wild Type Protein—Caldas et al. (14Caldas H. Jiang Y. Holloway M.P. Fangusaro J. Mahotka C. Altura R.A. Conway E.M. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1994-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) recently reported that survivin-2β and survivin-δEx3 can co-immunoprecipitate with wild type survivin when both versions are transiently transfected into human cells. Our in vivo data confirm this finding for survivin-2β, and our in vitro data extend it by demonstrating for the first time that survivin-2β and survivin-δEx3 can interact directly with wild type survivin to form heterodimers. Two regions of the wild type protein have been implicated in dimerization, residues 6-10, and the linker region (amino acids 89-102) between the BIR domain and the COOH-terminal α-helix (1Chantalat L. Skoufias D.A. Kleman J.P. Jung B. Dideberg O. Margolis R.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 183-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 2Verdecia M.A. Huang H. Dutil E. Kaiser D.A. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Our in vitro analysis is consistent with this as, although the folding of survivin-2β is predicted to be disrupted by the 23-amino acid BIR domain insertion, and the linker region is absent from survivin-δEx3, both variants retain amino acids 6-10, which may be sufficient to permit dimerization. Interestingly, BIR domains are typically present in tandem or multiple repeats, but this domain is singularly present in survivin; thus dimerization may provide a means of duplicating this domain. It should be noted, however, that although crystallographic and NMR studies have decribed survivin as a homodimer (1Chantalat L. Skoufias D.A. Kleman J.P. Jung B. Dideberg O. Margolis R.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 183-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 2Verdecia M.A. Huang H. Dutil E. Kaiser D.A. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 3Sun C. Nettesheim D. Liu Z. Olejniczak E.T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), it has yet to be determined whether dimerization is critical for its function in vivo. Survivin Isoforms Do Not Interact with the Chromosomal Passenger Complex in Vivo—During mitosis survivin operates in a complex with aurora-B kinase, borealin, and INCENP, and these “chromosomal passenger proteins” are mutually dependent upon each other for their localization and function (see Ref. 8Vagnarelli P. Earnshaw W.C. Chromosoma. 2004; 113: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Here we report that neither survivin-2β-GFP nor survivin-δEx3-GFP is able to immunoprecipitate endogenous chromosomal passengers from U2OS cells. As they do not co-localize with these proteins at any stage of mitosis this may not be wholly surprising. Thus to determine whether the inability of these isoforms to interact with the chromosomal passenger complex is due to their differences in localization, or vice versa, we performed immunoprecipitations on cells in which the chromosomal passenger of interest was also overexpressed. Using this method we discovered that survivin-2β-GFP, but not survivin-δEx3-GFP, was able to immunoprecipitate aurora-B and borealin, albeit less efficiently than the wild type protein. Consistent with these data, when investigated in vitro, a strong direct interaction occurred between wild type survivin and borealin; a comparatively weak interaction was detected between survivin-2β and borealin, and no interaction was seen between survivin-δEx3 and borealin. Previous reports have demonstrated that the interaction between wild type survivin and borealin is mediated by the BIR domain of survivin (7Gassmann R. Carvalho A. Henzing A.J. Ruchaud S. Hudson D.F. Honda R. Nigg E.A. Gerloff D.L. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 179-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 18Romano A. Guse A. Krascenicova I. Schnabel H. Schnabel R. Glotzer M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), that most of survivin is bound to borealin in mitotic cells, and that localization to the mitotic centromeres of survivin is borealin-dependent (7Gassmann R. Carvalho A. Henzing A.J. Ruchaud S. Hudson D.F. Honda R. Nigg E.A. Gerloff D.L. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 179-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). As the BIR domain is altered in survivin-2β and truncated in survivin-δEx3, our data are consistent with this region being responsible for interaction with borealin. Thus we conclude that the differential localization of these proteins within the cell is likely to be a consequence of their inefficiency/inability to bind directly to borealin. Survivin-2β and Survivin-δEx3 Are Low Abundance Proteins—To determine whether survivin isoforms are expressed as proteins in cycling HeLa and U2OS cells, we generated isoform-specific peptide antibodies. The level of expression of these versions of survivin was lower than our detection capabilities by immunoblotting; however, we were able to detect the endogenous proteins within the cell by immunofluorescence microscopy. Importantly, the pattern of localization was similar to that observed for GFP tagged versions of these proteins and no co-localization with wild type survivin was observed during mitosis (10Mahotka C. Liebmann J. Wenzel M. Suschek C.V. Schmitt M. Gabbert H.E. Gerharz C.D. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 1334-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Using the same antibodies Caldas et al. (14Caldas H. Jiang Y. Holloway M.P. Fangusaro J. Mahotka C. Altura R.A. Conway E.M. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1994-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) were able to detect survivin-δEx3, but not survivin-2β, in HeLa cell extracts. Whether the low abundance of these proteins is simply a consequence of the low level of mRNA available, or rapid turnover at the protein level, remains to be determined; however, accelerated proteosome-dependent clearance of survivin-δEx3, as compared with wild type protein, has been reported (10Mahotka C. Liebmann J. Wenzel M. Suschek C.V. Schmitt M. Gabbert H.E. Gerharz C.D. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 1334-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and may be due to an additional degradation signal in its COOH terminus (19Song Z. Wu M. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2723-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Indeed, in our hands we have also found that survivin-δEx3 is highly unstable in a number of systems. If a protein behaves in a dominant or dominant negative fashion, its presence, even at low levels, would be expected to alter cell behavior. To test whether these proteins have a dominant impact on cell cycle progression, we generated stable U2OS cells expressing GFP-tagged forms expressed from a cytomegalovirus promoter. Some initial problems were encountered generating the survivin-2β-GFP lines that suggested survivin-2β may be slightly cytotoxic. Once established, however, all lines expressing these isoforms grew normally and did not accumulate cells of increased ploidy, as compared with cells depleted of survivin, previously demonstrated by Lens et al. (20Lens S.M. Wolthuis R.M. Klompmaker R. Kauw J. Agami R. Brummelkamp T. Kops G. Medema R.H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2934-2947Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Thus these cells are clearly able to tolerate high levels of survivin-2β or survivin-δEx3 without any deleterious effects indicating that they do not interfere with the essential role of wild type survivin during mitosis. Only Expression of Wild Type Survivin cDNA Complements RNAi-mediated Pan-survivin Depletion—Here we have shown that overexpression of survivin isoforms at the protein level is inconsequential to the proliferation of HeLa and U2OS cells in culture. We have also presented complementation experiments to determine whether their expression is required for cell viability. We report that complementation with cDNA to wild type survivin alone is sufficient to restore proliferation indicating that the isoforms are not essential for normal cell cycle progression. In addition, our data reveal that neither survivin-2β cDNA nor survivin-δEx3 cDNA can rescue cell growth, demonstrating that they cannot substitute for the wild type protein. We have shown for the first time that the survivin splice variants, survivin-2β and survivin-δEx3, can form heterodimers with the wild type protein and have altered affinity for the chromosomal passenger, borealin. We also demonstrate that expression of survivin-2β or survivin-δEx3 in transformed human cells, even at high levels, is inconsequential to cell proliferation and that neither survivin-2β nor survivin-δEx3 can substitute for wild type function. We conclude that any correlation between patient prognosis and expression of survivin isoforms is unlikely to be due to interference with mitotic events. It will be interesting to determine whether these correlations can be attributed to interference with the anti-apoptotic activities of survivin."

The protein requires insertion of zinc and copper atoms, followed by the formation of a conserved S-S bond between Cys-57 and Cys-146 (human numbering), which makes the protein fully active.

Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1986; 58: 61-97PubMed Google Scholar). It is a dimer in all eukaryotes, whereas in prokaryotes it exists as either a dimer or a monomer. The mature, active form of SOD1 contains, in each subunit, a copper ion essential for catalysis and a zinc ion that has primarily a structural role. In the active site, a narrow channel is present that is large enough to admit only superoxide, water, and small anions and ligands such as imidazole and peroxynitrite. In the lining of the channel there is a positively charged side chain from an arginine residue (Arg-143, human numbering). The cationic residue generates an electrostatic gradient proposed to be responsible for steering the superoxide anion toward the active site. Site-directed mutagenesis of residue 143 to a neutral or anionic residue produced proteins with dramatically reduced or abolished activity (2Banci L. Bertini I. Luchinat C. Hallewell R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 3629-3633Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A peculiar feature of the mature form of SOD1 is the presence of a kinetically stable disulfide bond. Once formed, the disulfide bond is maintained in the reducing cytoplasmic environment where the majority of the SOD1 inside the cell is located. The presence of intramolecular disulfide bonds is common in secreted proteins, where their primary purpose is for protein stabilization. However, disulfide bonds are rare in intracellular proteins because of the highly reducing environment and low concentration of dioxygen in the cytosol (3Sevier C.S. Kaiser C.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 836-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 4Valentine J.S. Doucette P.A. Potter S.Z. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; Google Scholar). It has been previously shown that intramolecular disulfide bonds in intracellular proteins (like SOD1) can play more than just a structural role and have functional significance (3Sevier C.S. Kaiser C.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 836-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). The disulfide bond between Cys-57 and Cys-146 is fully conserved in all SOD1 structures. This bond links loop IV, which contains Cys-57, with strand β8, containing Cys-146. The linkage of the secondary structure elements contributes to the stabilization of the SOD1 fold. The active form of the protein is obtained when one zinc and one copper ion per subunit are bound. Although nothing is known on how the protein acquires the zinc ion, a description of the insertion of copper is available. The process is aided by a copper metallochaperone called CCS (copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase) (5Culotta V.C. Klomp L.W. Strain J. Casareno R.L. Krems B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol.

Genomics. 2001; 265: 873-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Yeast mutants lacking CCS express a form of SOD1 protein that is essentially apo for copper but contains zinc (5Culotta V.C.

However, a CCS-independent activation of mammalian SOD1 is possible (8Carroll M.C. Girouard J.B. Ulloa J.L. Subramaniam J.R. Wong P.C. Valentine J.S. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5964-5969Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). A mechanism of the copper transfer from CCS to SOD1 in yeast has been proposed based on the x-ray structure of the heterodimeric CCS-SOD1 complex (9Lamb A.L. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In this picture, SOD1 first loads zinc ions from an unknown source, and subsequently copper transfer takes place through the formation of an intermolecular S-S bond, involving Cys-57 of SOD1 and a Cys of CCS. The disulfide-reduced, copper-depleted form of SOD1 therefore represents the state of the protein before its complex formation with copper(I) CCS (10Furukawa Y. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2872-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Additionally, this protein state may play a relevant role in pathological conditions. The presence of exposed cysteine residues may modulate its ability to interact with other macromolecules and to give rise to large molecular aggregates (11Furukawa Y. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17266-17274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Aggregates containing SOD1 have been found in some fALS patients and in some fALS SOD1 transgenic mice and rats (12Wang J. Slunt H. Gonzales V. Fromholt D. Coonfield M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A.

A. 2000; 97: 12571-12576Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The fALS pathology has been related to mutations in the protein Cu,Zn-SOD1, some of which have a tendency to form fibrils (14Rowland L.P. Shneider N.A. N. Eng. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1688-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1565) Google Scholar). An increasing number of pathological states involve protein aggregates, which represent the final state of biomolecules with altered folding properties and/or structural conformations (15Taylor J.P. Hardy J. Fischbeck K.H. Science. 2005; 296: 1991-1995Crossref Scopus (996) Google Scholar). To avoid interference effects arising from Cys-6 and Cys-111 (i.e. the two other Cys present in SOD1 that are in the reduced state), we studied the thermostable mutant of human SOD1 (C6A, C111S), which is structurally and functionally equivalent to the wild type protein (16Hallewell R.A.

Currently, there are a huge number of structures of SOD1 (>50, ∼10 of which of human SOD1) deposited in the Protein Data Bank in various states (22Strange R.W. Antonyuk S. Hough M.A. Doucette P.A.

Biochem. 2002; 269: 1905-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), including several mutants, but all with the disulfide bond intact. Therefore, the structural characterization of E,Zn-SOD1 with the disulfide bond reduced that is reported here (hereafter E,Zn-hasSOD1SH-SH) is particularly meaningful as it is the first structure of SOD1 with the disulfide bond broken. It represents the step before the protein acquires copper but also a state that is emerging to be relevant in the fALS-related SOD1 mutants (11Furukawa Y. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17266-17274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 26Tiwari A. Hayward L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5984-5992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Therefore, it provides useful new data on the features of SOD1. Sample Preparation—Human asSOD1 (hasSOD1) was expressed in the Escherichia coli TOPP1 (Stratagene) or BL21(DE3) strain. The 15N and 15N, 13C, 2H-labeled protein samples were obtained as previously reported (25Banci L. Bertini I. Cramaro F. Del Conte R. Viezzoli M.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1905-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The protein was isolated and purified according to previously published protocols (16Hallewell R.A. Imlay K.C. Laria I. Gallegos C. Fong N.M. Irvine B. Cabelli D.E. Bielski B.H.J. Olson P. Mullenbach G.T. Cousens L.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 474-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The triple-labeled dimeric hasSOD1 contained ∼70% 2H. Metal ions were removed according to published protocols (27McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and zinc reconstitution was obtained as described in Ref. 17Lepock J.R. Frey H.E. Hallewell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21612-21618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The reduction of disulfide bridge was accomplished by addition of dithiothreitol. Fully reduced and empty copper protein hasSOD1 (E,Zn-hasSOD1SH-SH) was prepared under a nitrogen atmosphere in an anaerobic chamber. The thiol-disulfide status of purified hasSOD1 was determined by chemical modification with the thiol-specific reagent 4-acetamide-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (Molecular Probes, Inc.) (10Furukawa Y. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2872-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The NMR samples of the E,Zn-hasSOD1SH-SH were in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5, 90% H2O/10% D2O. The final protein concentration ranges between 1 and 1.5 mm in the presence of 20 mm dithiothreitol. ∼0.6 ml of sample was loaded into high quality NMR tubes that were capped with latex serum caps in the Vacuum Atmospheres chamber. NMR Measurements and Structure Calculation—The NMR spectra were acquired on Avance 900, 800, 600, and 500 Bruker spectrometers. All of the triple resonance probes used were equipped with pulsed field gradients along the z-axis. The 800- and 500-MHz spectrometers were equipped with a triple resonance cryoprobe. The NMR experiments, used for the backbone and the aliphatic side chain resonances assignment and for obtaining structural restraints, recorded on 2H/13C/15N/, 13C/15N-enriched and unlabeled E,Zn-hasSOD1SH-SH samples, are summarized in supplemental Table S1. The 1H, 13C, and 15N resonance assignments of E,Zn-hasSOD1SH-SH are reported in supplemental Table S2. In total, 88% of the 1H, 98% of the 15N, and 80% of the 13C have been assigned. The combined variation of the 15N and 1H amide chemical shifts of E,Zn-hasSOD1SH-SH, Cu,Zn-hasSOD1SS, and E,Zn-E133QM2-asSOD1SS are shown in supplemental Fig. S1. 1H-1H nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) experiment (80-ms mixing time) (28Wider G. Macura S. Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. J. Magn. Reson. 1984; 56: 207-234Google Scholar) was carried out to identify connectivities involving histidines of the binding sites at 298 K. All the spectra were collected at 298 K, processed using the standard Bruker software (XWINNMR), and analyzed through the CARA program (29Keller R.L.J. The Computer-aided Resonance Assignment Tutorial (1.3). 2004; (Cantina Verlag)Google Scholar). An automated CANDID approach combined with DYANA torsion angle dynamics algorithm (30Herrmann T. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar) was used to assign the ambiguous NOE cross-peaks and to have a preliminary protein structure. Structure calculations were then performed through iterative cycles of DYANA (31Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2548) Google Scholar) followed by restrained energy minimization with AMBER 5.0 (32Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.S. Cheatham T.E. Ferguson D.M. Seibel G.L. Singh U.C. Weiner P.K. Kollman P.A. AMBER 5.0. University of California, San Francisco1997Google Scholar) applied to each member of the final DYANA family. The assessment of the structures was evaluated using the program PROCHECK-NMR (33Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A.C. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4360) Google Scholar). The root mean square deviation values for the backbone and heavy atoms of one subunit are shown in supplemental Fig. S2. 15N R1, R2, and steady-state heteronuclear NOEs, which can provide information on internal mobility as well as on the overall protein tumbling rate, were measured with pulse sequences as described by Farrow et al. (34Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2002) Google Scholar). R2 were measured using a refocusing time of 450 ms. In all experiments the water signal was suppressed with the “water flip back” scheme (35Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12593-12594Crossref Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). Average R1, R2, and 1H-15N NOE values of 0.81 ± 0.10, 23.7 ± 2.9, and 0.82 ± 0.10 s-1 are found, respectively, at 600 MHz. A correlation time of 17.3 ± 2.3 ns was estimated from the R2/R1 ratio (the experimental relaxation rates are shown in supplemental Fig. S3). The exchange with the solvent of the backbone amide proton was investigated through a series of 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) experiments performed over 4 days on the E,Zn-hasSOD1SH-SH protein previously frozen dry and then dissolved in D2O. Exchange with the bulk solvent in D2O solution was measured following the intensity of amide proton moieties in 15N-HSQC spectra. The amide protons can be grouped in three groups: fast exchanging (the peak disappears in less than 20 min), intermediate exchanging (the peak is still present after 20 min but disappears within 10 h), and slow exchanging (the peak persists after 10 h). The behavior indicates not only solvent exposure but also the presence of hydrogen bonding, which may slow down the exchange of the exposed amide protons. This is the case for almost all residues located in regions having a defined secondary structure, as they are involved in extensive H-bond networks that stabilize the β-barrel structure typical of this protein. Copper(I) Insertion—The copper-depleted protein was added with the copper(I) complex (Cu(CH3CN)4)+ in a 1:1 ratio in an anaerobic chamber. The protein was then washed extensively in the presence of phosphate buffer 20 mm at pH 5. The metal uptake of the protein was established through one-dimensional NMR spectrum in the region of imidazole NHs (10-16 ppm). The structure of the copper-depleted thermostable form (C6A, C111S) of human SOD1 with the disulfide bond reduced (E,Zn-hasSOD1SH-SH) has been determined in solution by NMR with high resolution (root mean square deviation 0.66 ± 0.14 and 1.15 ± 0.13 for the backbone and heavy atom, respectively, considering the segments involved in the β-barrel). The structure quality and the statistics on constraint violations for the final family is shown in Table 1. The protein is in a dimeric state and completely maintains the global fold of mature SOD1 (Fig. 1). Surprisingly, the breakage of the disulfide bond does not significantly destabilize the protein structure. This can suggest a functional rather than structural role for this highly conserved moiety. In addition, the backbone conformation of the region at the dimer interface (residues 53-55, 149-151) is very similar to that found in x-ray (22Strange R.W. Antonyuk S. Hough M.A. Doucette P.A.

Weiss M.S. Valentine J.S. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2167-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and solution structures (25Banci L. Bertini I. Cramaro F. Del Conte R. Viezzoli M.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1905-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) of human and yeast Cu,Zn-SOD1SS. Local conformational rearrangements are found essentially only in the immediate surrounding of the two cysteines (Cys-57 and -146) involved in the intrasubunit disulfide bond. This protein region, and in particular residue 57, becomes extremely more solvent accessible with respect to the oxidized protein (Fig. 2). The solvent exposure of cysteine 57 is a peculiarity that is never observed in SOD1 structures, not even in the apo form of the protein (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S4). The presence of the disulfide bond, in fact, prevents solvent exposure by forcing the Cys-57 to reach the Cys-146 that is located within the protein core. Solvent exposure is also confirmed by H2O/D2O solvent exchange measurements. The region spatially close to the cysteine residues responsible for the disulfide bridge (residues 57 and 146) appears more exposed to the solvent. This was not observed in the structures of Cu,Zn-hasSOD1SS and E,Zn-E133QM2-asSOD1SS.TABLE 1Statistical analysis of the energy-minimized family of conformers and the mean structure of E, Zn-hasSOD1SH-SHREMaREM indicates the energy minimized family of 30 structures, 〈REM〉 is the energy-minimized mean structure obtained from the coordinates of the individual REM structures(REM)aREM indicates the energy minimized family of 30 structures, 〈REM〉 is the energy-minimized mean structure obtained from the coordinates of the individual REM structuresRoot mean square violations per meaningful distance constraint (Å)bThe number of meaningful constraints for each class is reported in parentheses(30 structures)(mean)Intraresidue (554)0.0184 ± 0.00160.0215Sequential (1496)0.0099 ± 0.00140.0102Medium range (1023)cMedium range distance constraints are those between residues (i,i+2), (i,i+3), (i,i+4), and (i,i+5)0.0107 ± 0.00140.0096Long range (2734)0.0102 ± 0.00130.0079Total (5807)0.0113 ± 0.00090.0108Root mean square violations per meaningful dihedral angle constraints (deg)bThe number of meaningful constraints for each class is reported in parenthesesPhi (183)2.72 ± 1.761.98Psi (162)2.67 ± 1.022.11Average number of constraints per residue19Average number of violations per structureIntraresidue25.2 ± 2.526Sequential25.4 ± 3.930Medium range19.2 ± 3.318Long range45.7 ± 3.930Total115.5 ± 7.2104Phi18.6 ± 2.714Psi14.4 ± 2.912Average no. of NOE violations larger than 0.3 Å0.02 ± 0.170Average no. of NOE violations between 0.1 Å and 0.3 Å16.88 ± 4.24115Average NOE target function (Å2)0.88 ± 0.140.82Average angle target function (rad2)0.80 ± 0.500.48Structural analysisdAs it results from the Ramachandran plot analysis% of residues in most favorable regions65.0%67.6%% of residues in allowed regions29.1%27.3%% of residues in generously allowed regions5.2%4.2%% of residues in disallowed regions0.8%0.8%Secondary structure elements (residues 1–153)β1 (3–6), β2 (15–21), β3 (29–37), B4 (41–48), β5 (85–89), β6 (94–101), β7 (116–121), α1 (131–137), β8 (143–152)a REM indicates the energy minimized family of 30 structures, 〈REM〉 is the energy-minimized mean structure obtained from the coordinates of the individual REM structuresb The number of meaningful constraints for each class is reported in parenthesesc Medium range distance constraints are those between residues (i,i+2), (i,i+3), (i,i+4), and (i,i+5)d As it results from the Ramachandran plot analysis Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2Solvent exposure of Cys-57 in the structures of one subunit of thermostable E,Zn-hasSOD1SH-SH (left), Cu,Zn-hasSOD1SS (right; Protein Data Bank code 1SOS), and wild type E,E-hSOD1SS (center; Protein Data Bank code 1HL4). The surface of Cys-57 is shown in lighter color.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Interestingly, the metal binding ligands in E,Zn-hasSOD1SH-SH have a conformation very close to that found in Cu,Zn-hasSOD1SS and in the monomeric copper-depleted form (24Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. D'Onofrio M. Viezzoli M.S. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2479-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 25Banci L. Bertini I. Cramaro F. Del Conte R. Viezzoli M.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1905-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), indicating that the protein is ready to harbor the catalytic metal. In the active site channel of Cu,Zn-SOD1SS, located between the electrostatic loop VII (121-142) and loop IV (49-84), some H-bonds form a highly conserved network that is important for generating the optimal electrostatic field necessary to attract and drive the substrate toward the copper site. In the present structure most of the H-bonds are maintained with the exceptions of the copper ligand His-48 hydrogen bonded to Cys-57 via the carbonyl oxygen of Gly-61 and the catalytically important side chain of Arg-143. This is also assessed by the chemical shift perturbation of the amide proton of Gly-61 (supplemental Fig. S1). The total solvent exposure of Cys-57 located in loop IV is also reflected in an increased solvent exposure of residues 48 and 146, which are buried in Cu,Zn-hSOD1SS. Accordingly, the relative amide protons display fast hydrogen/deuterium exchange in E,Zn-hasSOD1SH-SH (data not shown). The conformation of Arg-143 is extremely sensitive to the position of Cys-57 (37Banci L. Carloni P. La Penna G. Orioli P.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 6994-7001Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 38Banci L. Bertini I. Del Conte R. Viezzoli M.S. Biospectroscopy. 1999; 5: 33-41Crossref Google Scholar, 39Banci L. Bertini I. Del Conte R. Mangani S. Viezzoli M.S. Fadin R. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Arg-143 is located at the end of the electrostatic loop (loop VII) whose conformation greatly affects the enzymatic activity. In the dimeric Cu,Zn-hasSOD1SS solution structure, Cys-57 is quite rigid along with loop VII. As a consequence, the side chain of Arg-143 is highly ordered and is in the optimal conformation to interact with the superoxide anion bound to copper. In the monomeric Cu,Zn-E133QM2-asSOD1SS species, loop IV containing Cys-57 experiences conformational equilibria and Arg-143 moves away from copper, determining a sizable drop in SOD activity (40Banci L. Benedetto M. Bertini I. Del Conte R. Piccioli M. Viezzoli M.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11780-11791Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In the present structure, loop IV is highly disordered due to the S-S breaking resulting in extensive disorder of the Arg-143 side chain. Consequently, the overall electrostatic field is highly perturbed. The comparison of our solution structure with that of monomeric E,ZnE133QM2-asSOD1SS (24Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. D'Onofrio M. Viezzoli M.S. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2479-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) reveals that the observed disorder of residue Arg-143 is not a consequence of the absence of copper but of the relaxation of loop IV due to the S-S breaking. The breakage of the disulfide bond results in a perturbed distribution of the electrostatic charges in the active site channel essential to guide the superoxide ion in the catalytic site. Two mechanisms have been proposed for copper uptake and consequent activation of human SOD1; the first requires the presence of CCS (9Lamb A.L. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 41Lamb A.L. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14720-14727Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and the second involves the reduced form of glutathione (8Carroll M.C. Girouard J.B. Ulloa J.L. Subramaniam J.R. Wong P.C. Valentine J.S. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5964-5969Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The first mechanism, described in yeast, is based on the x-ray structure of the heterodimeric yeast CCS-SOD1 complex. Although a direct comparison with the yeast E,Zn-SOD1SH-SH is not possible because of the lack of its structure in the Protein Data Bank, the present solution structure shares some specific features with that of the yeast mutant H48F SOD1 in the heterodimeric complex with CCS (9Lamb A.L. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). All SOD1 residues involved in the interaction with domain II of CCS (residues 51, 114, 152) experience similar conformation in E,Zn-hasSOD1SH-SH regardless of the differences in the primary sequence. It has been proposed that in yeast the presence of Pro-142 and Pro-144 in place of Ser-142 and Leu-144 may account for the loss of ability to acquire copper independently of CCS (8Carroll M.C. Girouard J.B. Ulloa J.L. Subramaniam J.R. Wong P.C. Valentine J.S. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5964-5969Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Because yeast E,Zn-SOD1SH-SH has been found to be monomeric (10Furukawa Y. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2872-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), we can speculate that these differences in the primary sequence destabilize the structure of this region, leading to monomerization (Leu-144 is inserted in the hydrophobic part of the protein called the plug of the barrel). The correct conformation for acquiring copper could be restored only by the formation of the heterodimeric complex with CCS facilitated by interaction with domain III. However, the complexity of the issue is demonstrated by the increased propensity to monomerization displayed by a subgroup of fALS mutants (for example G85R, D125H, L38V) that have the mutation far away from the dimer interface (11Furukawa Y.

In the crystal structure of the heterodimeric complex, an intermolecular disulfide bond between Cys-57 of SOD1 and Cys-229 of CCS was found. If the present solution structure is superimposed on the yeast H48F SOD1 in the heterodimeric complex, a similar distance of the sulfur atom of Cys-57 from that of Cys-229 of CCS is found (0.20 nm in the heterodimer complex and 0.28 nm in the superimposed solution structure of E,Zn-hasSOD1SH-SH). This feature demonstrates that Cys-57 has a favorable conformation to form the same disulfide bond. Also, in the heterodimer complex the side chain of Arg-143 is far away from the copper site and is hydrogen bonded to the backbone of Ala-230 of yeast CCS; the mobility of Arg-143 could have the role of making its side chain available for this kind of interaction. On the basis of the present structure we can speculate that the copper ion could enter in its site with the assistance of Cys-57, which, being close to the copper site, could constitute a ligand in a hypothetical intermediate (Fig. 4). Indeed, the high affinity of copper for thiol groups and the complete exposure of the side chain of Cys-57 could be significant for the incorporation of copper ion into the protein, regardless of whether this occurs through the interaction with CCS (9Lamb A.L. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 41Lamb A.L. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C.

Independently of the mechanism by which the copper enters the site in vivo, we have observed that E,Zn-hasSOD1SH-SH is able to acquire copper(I) in vitro. The acquisition of copper can, in fact, be easily monitored by one-dimensional NMR spectrum of imidazole NH protons. Supplemental Fig. S5 shows the signals originated by copper binding; the figure also shows that the spectra of Cu(I),Zn-hasSOD1SH-SH and Cu(I),Zn-hSOD1SS are very similar (and different from E,Zn-hasSOD1SH-SH), thus demonstrating that the metal enters correctly in its site. Subsequent oxidation of the disulfide bond would allow the formation of the hydrogen bond network constraining the side chain of Arg-143, making the protein fully functioning. Exposed cysteines can also easily form interprotein disulfide bonds, thus giving rise to aggregates. The status of the disulfide bond in fALS SOD1 mutants has not been extensively characterized, although in all crystal structures of fALS mutants such bonds are intact (42Antonyuk S. Elam J.S. Hough M.A. Strange R.W. Doucette P.A. Rodriguez J.A. Hayward L.J. Valentine J.S. Hart P.J. Hasnain S.S. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1201-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 43Hart P.J. Liu H.

However, the disulfide bonds in fALS mutants are more susceptible to reduction than wild type SOD1 (26Tiwari A. Hayward L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5984-5992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that in some fALS mutants, fibrils are formed through intersubunit S-S bonds (11Furukawa Y. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17266-17274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). This implies that under cellular disulfide-reducing conditions at physiological pH and temperature, the fALS SOD1 mutants are more prone to aggregation. The present structure provides an important piece of information for understanding the copper uptake mechanism in SOD1 and for the debate about which is the relevant form of SOD1 for the onset of the fALS pathology.

https://openalex.org/W2094423596,"DLK1 (delta-like) is a transmembrane and secreted protein in the epidermal growth factor-like homeotic family. Although expressed widely during embryonic development, only a few tissues retain the expression in adults. Neuroendocrine tumors often highly express this protein; therefore, we hypothesized that brain tumors might also express it. This study found that the expression of DLK1 in gliomas was higher than that in normal brain (P<0.05). After stable transfection of a DLK1 cDNA expression vector into GBM cell lines, their proliferation was increased. Furthermore, they lost contact inhibition, had enhanced anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, and had significantly greater capacity to migrate. Western blot studies showed that expression of cyclin D1, CDK2, and E2F4 were increased, and Rb levels were decreased in these cells. DLK1 was found on the cell surface and secreted in the medium from the transfected GBM cells. DLK1-enriched condition medium stimulated the growth of glioblastoma multiforme cell lines and explants. DLK1 antibody blocked cell growth stimulated by DLK1. In summary, these results suggest that DLK1 may play a role in the formation or progression of gliomas."
https://openalex.org/W2031532912,"Oxalate oxidase (EC 1.2.3.4) catalyzes the conversion of oxalate and dioxygen to hydrogen peroxide and carbon dioxide. In this study, glycolate was used as a structural analogue of oxalate to investigate substrate binding in the crystalline enzyme. The observed monodentate binding of glycolate to the active site manganese ion of oxalate oxidase is consistent with a mechanism involving C-C bond cleavage driven by superoxide anion attack on a monodentate coordinated substrate. In this mechanism, the metal serves two functions: to organize the substrates (oxalate and dioxygen) and to transiently reduce dioxygen. The observed structure further implies important roles for specific active site residues (two asparagines and one glutamine) in correctly orientating the substrates and reaction intermediates for catalysis. Combined spectroscopic, biochemical, and structural analyses of mutants confirms the importance of the asparagine residues in organizing a functional active site complex."
https://openalex.org/W2067836992,"The Smad4+/E6sad mouse carries a null mutation in the endogenous Smad4 gene resulting in serrated adenomas and mixed polyposis of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract with 100% penetrance. Here, we show by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis and immunohistochemistry (IHC) that, although the majority of the tumors appear at 9 months of age, somatic loss of the wild-type Smad4 allele occurs only at later stages of tumor progression. Hence, haploinsufficiency underlies Smad4-driven tumor initiation in the GI tract. As both the Apc and Smad4 tumor suppressor genes map to mouse chromosome 18, we have bred Smad4+/E6sad with the Apc+/1638N model to generate two distinct compound heterozygous lines carrying both mutations either in cis (CAS) or in trans (TAS). Strikingly, both models show increased tumor multiplicities when compared with the single mutant littermates, although CAS mice are more severely affected and became moribund at only 5–6 weeks of age. Phenotypic and molecular analyses indicate that Smad4 haploinsufficiency is sufficient to significantly affect tumor initiation and progression both prior to and upon loss of Apc function. Moreover, complete loss of Smad4 strongly enhances Apc-driven tumor formation."

In this study, we have used site-specific mutagenesis to map amino acid residues that are critical in calreticulin function. We have focused on two cysteine residues (Cys88 and Cys120), which form a disulfide bridge in the N-terminal domain of calreticulin, on a tryptophan residue located in the carbohydrate binding site (Trp302), and on certain residues located at the tip of the “hairpin-like” P-domain of the protein (Glu238, Glu239, Asp241, Glu243, and Trp244). Calreticulin mutants were expressed in crt-/- fibroblasts, and bradykinin-dependent Ca2+ release was measured as a marker of calreticulin function. Bradykinin-dependent Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum was rescued by wild-type calreticulin and by the Glu238, Glu239, Asp241, and Glu243 mutants. The Cys88 and Cys120 mutants rescued the calreticulin-deficient phenotype only partially (∼40%), and the Trp244 and Trp302 mutants did not rescue it at all. We identified four amino acid residues (Glu239, Asp241, Glu243, and Trp244) at the hairpin tip of the P-domain that are critical in the formation of a complex between ERp57 and calreticulin. Although the Glu239, Asp241, and Glu243 mutants did not bind ERp57 efficiently, they fully restored bradykinin-dependent Ca2+ release in crt-/- cells. This indicates that binding of ERp57 to calreticulin may not be critical for the chaperone function of calreticulin with respect to the bradykinin receptor.

Therefore, in this study, we used restoration of bradykinin-dependent Ca2+ release from the ER to compare the function of several site-specific calreticulin mutants with that of wild-type calreticulin. We focused on two cysteine residues that form a disulfide bridge in the N-domain of calreticulin, on a centrally located tryptophan residue in the carbohydrate binding site, and on several residues located at the tip of the “extended arm” of the protein's P-domain. We have identified two tryptophan residues that are critical for the chaperone function of calreticulin: Trp302, which is located in the carbohydrate binding pocket and Trp244, which is found at the tip of the P-domain's extended arm. In contrast, mutation of the cysteine residues disrupted the chaperone function only partially. We have also identified four amino acid residues at the tip of the “extended arm” of the P-domain that are critical in the formation of an ERp57-calreticulin complex.

Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—The sensor chip was activated, coupled, and blocked using the amine coupling kit from BIAcore. Specifically, two lanes on a CM5 chip were activated using a 1:1 mixture of N-hydroxysuccinimide/N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride for 7 min at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. Purified calreticulin or calreticulin mutants were then immobilized in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4, at a flow rate of 5 ml/min, and this was followed by blocking with 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5, for 7 min at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. A control channel on the sensor chip was activated and blocked, using amino-coupling reagent, without immobilization of protein. The protein bound to the control channel was subtracted from the protein bound to the other channels to determine specific binding. The flow buffer contained 20 mm Tris, pH 7, 135 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Tween 20, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μm benzamidine, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (23Milner R.E.

Binding was carried out at 20 °C at a flow rate of 30 ml/min. The binding data were analyzed by nonlinear least squares curve fitting. Association and dissociation constants, ka and kd, were generated from the association and dissociation curves from the BIAcore experiments. ERp57 was expressed in E. coli and purified as previously described (24Corbett E.F. Oikawa K. Francois P. Tessier D.C. Kay C. Bergeron J.J.M. Thomas D.Y. Krause K.-H. Michalak M. J. Biol.

Expression of Calreticulin Mutants in Calreticulin-deficient Cells— Several domains have been identified in calreticulin by three-dimensional structural modeling (9Michalak M. Robert Parker J.M. Opas M. Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The N-terminal globular domain of the protein contains a carbohydrate (lectin) binding site (10Schrag J.D.

Dabrowska M. Campbell I.D. Eggleton P. Opas M. Michalak M. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 20: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The central, proline-rich P-domain of calreticulin forms an extended arm and binds ERp57 (17Ellgaard L. Bettendorff P. Braun D. Herrmann T. Fiorito F. Jelesarov I. Guntert P. Helenius A. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 773-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To assess the functional significance of these regions in calreticulin, we carried out site-specific mutagenesis. The cysteine residues Cys88 and Cys120 (in the N-terminal domain) were mutated to alanine, to prevent formation of the disulfide bridge. A tryptophan residue located centrally in the carbohydrate binding pocket (Trp302) was also mutated. Finally, a series of residues located at the tip of the “extended arm” of the P-domain (Glu283, Glu239, Asp241, Asp243, and Trp244) were also mutated. Calreticulin-deficient (crt-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (K42) were stably transfected with the expression vectors encoding these site-specific mutants, creating cell lines expressing wild-type calreticulin (crt-/--wt) or one of the calreticulin mutants (crt-/--C88, crt-/--C120, crt-/--E238, crt-/--E239, crt-/--D241, crt-/--E243, crt-/--W244, and crt-/--W302). The recombinant proteins were identified by an HA epitope, which was introduced at the C terminus (11Nakamura K. Zuppini A. Arnaudeau S. Lynch J. Ahsan I. Krause R. Papp S. De Smedt H. Parys J.B.

Castelbou C. Michalak M. Demaurex N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46696-46705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis showed that all of the transfected cells (crt-/--C88, crt-/--C120, crt-/--E238, crt-/--E239, crt-/--D241, crt-/--E243, crt-/--W244, and crt-/--W302) expressed recombinant protein (Fig. 1), and this was confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis. Using immunofluorescence, we also showed that the recombinant protein was localized in an ER-like network, by staining of the same cells with antibodies against protein disulfide isomerase, Grp94, and calnexin (data not shown). Bradykinin-induced Ca2+ Release in Cells Expressing Calreticulin Mutants—Calreticulin-deficient cells have inhibited bradykinin-dependent Ca2+ release, which is restored by expression of full-length recombinant calreticulin (Fig. 2A) (11Nakamura K. Zuppini A. Arnaudeau S. Lynch J. Ahsan I. Krause R. Papp S. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Müller-Esterl W. Lew D.P. Krause K.-H. Demaurex N. Opas M. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We took advantage of this, using the recovery of bradykinin-dependent Ca2+ release from the ER, in crt-/- cells, as a model system in which to compare the function of calreticulin and the various mutants we had generated. Fig. 2A shows that, as expected, bradykinin caused a rapid and transient increase in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration in wild-type cells but not in crt-/- cells (11Nakamura K. Zuppini A. Arnaudeau S. Lynch J. Ahsan I. Krause R. Papp S. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Müller-Esterl W. Lew D.P. Krause K.-H. Demaurex N. Opas M. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Also, as expected, the expression of recombinant calreticulin in the crt-/- cells fully restored the bradykinin-dependent Ca2+ release (Fig. 2A). Next, we measured bradykinin-dependent Ca2+ release in calreticulin-deficient cells (crt-/-) expressing the various calreticulin mutants. In crt-/- cells expressing recombinant calreticulin with mutations at the tip of extended arm of the P-domain, bradykinin-dependent Ca2+ release was partially recovered (Fig. 2A). Specifically, expression of the mutants Glu238, Glu239, Asp241, and Glu243 restored bradykinin-dependent Ca2+ release to 55, 75, 73, and 78% of the control, respectively (Fig. 2A). In contrast, expression of the Trp302 calreticulin mutant did not restore bradykinin-dependent Ca2+ release, and expression of Trp244 mutant restored only >10% of the activity (Fig. 2A). However, Trp244 and Trp302 calreticulin mutants had no effect on Ca2+ capacity of the ER stores (Fig. 2B). The expression of SERCA and InsP3 receptors (Fig. 2C) was not altered in crt-/- cells expressing Trp244 and Trp302 mutants. In digitionin-permeabilized cells, InsP3-induced Ca2+ release from ER was indistinguishable in wild-type cells and in crt-/- cells expressing Trp244 and Trp302 calreticulin mutants (data not shown), indicating that InsP3 receptors were functional in these cells. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis revealed that the cell surface localization of the bradykinin receptor was also not affected by in cells the expression of Trp244 and Trp302 calreticulin mutants (Fig. 2D). We concluded that Trp244 and Trp302 residues play an essential role in the function of calreticulin as far as folding of the bradykinin receptor is concerned. Last, we investigated the functional consequence of mutating the cysteine residues involved in formation of the disulfide bridge in the N-domain of calreticulin (Cys88 and Cys120). Fig. 2A shows that bradykinin-dependent Ca2+ release was increased by only 38 and 40%, compared with the control, in cells expressing the Cys88 and Cys120 mutants, respectively. These data demonstrate that the cysteine residues are also critical in determining the ability of calreticulin to function properly as a chaperone. Effect of Calreticulin Mutants on Thermal Aggregation of MDH—In order to further examine the role of the residues Cys88, Cys120, Trp244, and Trp302 in the chaperone activity of calreticulin, we exploited an in vitro assay used previously (12Guo L.

Honeybees are known to fly a feeder-to-hive or hive-to-feeder vector according to whether or not they have recently fed--their feeding state controls which compass direction they select.

They reported the existence of an alternative first exon in the murine vdac-1 gene that encodes a different leader peptide at the N terminus, a signal that purportedly targets the protein to the plasma membrane through the Golgi apparatus. Under this scenario, the signal peptide is eventually cleaved away to produce a plasmalemmal VDAC (pl-VDAC) protein identical to the mitochondrial protein. Other mechanisms involving alternative mRNA untranslated regions have also been hypothesized to explain the extramitochondrial localization of porin (27Bathori G. Parolini I. Szabo I. Tombola F.

Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2004; 59: 87-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). If the maxianion channel is a pl-VDAC, then deletion and/or silencing of the VDAC genes would be expected to eliminate the channel activity and abolish the maxianion channel-mediated ATP release. Here we present the results of such a study. Generation of VDAC-deficient Mouse Fibroblasts—The gene targeting strategies for the vdac1, vdac2, and vdac3 genes have been described previously (40Wu S. Sampson M.J. Decker W.K. Craigen W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1452: 68-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). VDAC1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were isolated from day 11.5 vdac1–/– embryos, derived from the cross of vdac1–/– mice. Mouse embryos derived from the cross of vdac3–/– females and vdac3+/– males were harvested at day 11.5, and vdac3–/– MEFs were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (36Graham B.H. Craigen W.J. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2004; 59: 87-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). vdac2–/– embryos die in midgestation, but MEFs derived from embryos harvested before then are viable. vdac2–/– embryonic stem cell clones were microinjected into blastocysts obtained from C57BL/6 female mice. MEFs derived from 8.5-day chimeric embryos were treated with 0.3 mg/ml G418. Deficiency of VDAC2 following G418 selection was confirmed by both PCR and immunoblotting with anti-VDAC2 antibodies. Double-deficient (dKO) mouse adult fibroblasts (MAFs) were isolated from skin biopsies of adult double-knockout (vdac1–/–/vdac3–/–) mice generated by crossing vdac1–/–/vdac3+/– females to vdac1+/–/vdac3+/– males. Cultured fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's high glucose plus pyruvate medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin (100 units/ml) plus streptomycin (100 units/ml) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. VDAC protein expression was verified by Western blotting using affinity-purified anti-VDAC1 rabbit polyclonal antibodies and anti-VDAC2 and anti-VDAC3 chicken polyclonal antibodies (41Decker W.K. Craigen W.J. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 70: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). vdac2 gene silencing was performed by RNA interference in dKO fibroblasts. The following oligonucleotides, targeting three different regions of the mouse vdac2 gene, were used to generate the hairpin-encoding inserts for the three RNAi constructs: 5′-TTTTCTCGAGCCGCCTCGGCTGTGATGTTGACTTCAAGAGA-3′ and 5′-CCTTGGTACCTTCCAAAAACCTCGGCTGTGATGTTGACTCTCTTGAA-3′ (RNAi-1 construct); 5′-TTTTCTCGAGCCGCTTTGCAGTCGGCTACAGGTTCAAGAGA-3′ and 5′-CCTTGGTACCTTCCAAAAACTTTGCAGTCGGCTACAGGTCTCTTGAA-3′ (RNAi-2 construct); 5′-TTTTCTCGAGCCGTGGGACAGAATTTGGAGGATTCAAGAGA-3′, and 5′-CCTTGGTACCTTCCAAAAATGGGACAGAATTTGGAGGATCTCTTGAA-3′ (RNAi-3 construct). The underlined sequences are 19-nucleotide target sequences corresponding to the regions of murine vdac2. The oligonucleotides were annealed, extended with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase, and cloned into a pBluescript II KS+ vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) containing the mouse RNAase P H1 promoter and a puromycin resistance gene. Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science)-mediated transfection of fibroblasts was performed with these three RNAi constructs as well as with the control construct containing only the RNAase P H1 promoter and puromycin resistance gene. Clones stably expressing hairpin siRNAs were selected with 5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). The effectiveness of VDAC2 down-regulation by each RNAi construct was studied by Western blotting with specific anti-VDAC2 antibodies. For patch clamp experiments, the cells were grown on glass coverslips and were transferred to the chamber immediately before experiments. Solutions—The normal Ringer solution for patch clamp contained 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Na-HEPES, 6 mm HEPES, 5 mm glucose (pH 7.4; 290 mosmol/kg H2O). For selectivity measurements, 135 mm NaCl in Ringer solution was replaced with 135 mm of tetraethylammonium or sodium glutamate. The pipette solution for inside-out experiments was either normal Ringer solution or solution containing 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4, adjusted with KOH). The pipette solution for outside-out experiments contained 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2,5 mm Na-HEPES, 6 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA (pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH, pCa 7.7, 280 mosmol/kg H2O). For K/Cl permeability measurements, the bath solution contained 1000 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4, adjusted with KOH). The bath solution for bromide and acetate permeability measurements contained 1000 mm KBr or potassium acetate, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4, adjusted with KOH or acetic acid, respectively). For ATP permeability measurements, 100 mm Na2ATP solution was used after the pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. The hypotonic solution for ATP release measurements contained 92 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Na-HEPES, 6 mm HEPES, 5 mm glucose (pH 7.4, 210 mosmol/kg H2O, 72% hypotonicity). GdCl3 was stored as a 50 mm stock solution in water and added directly to Ringer solution immediately before each experiment. 5-Nitro-2-(phenylpropylamino)-benzoate, glibenclamide, 4-acetamino-4′-isothiocyanostilbene, arachidonic acid, indomethacin, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, and clotrimazole were purchased from Sigma and were added to Ringer solution immediately before use from stock solutions in Me2SO. Me2SO did not have any effect when added alone at a concentration of less than 0.1%. The osmolality of all solutions was measured using a freezing point depression osmometer (OM802; Vogel). Electrophysiology—Patch electrodes were fabricated from borosilicate glass capillaries using a laser micropipette puller (P-2000; Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA) and had a tip resistance of around 1.5–2 megaohms when filled with pipette solution. Membrane currents were measured with an EPC-9 patch clamp system (Heka-Electronics, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany). The membrane potential was controlled by shifting the pipette potential (Vp). The membrane potential is reported as –Vp. Currents were filtered at 1 kHz and sampled at 5–10 kHz. Data acquisition and analysis were done using Pulse+PulseFit (Heka-Electronics). Whenever the bath Cl– concentration was altered, a salt bridge containing 3 m KCl in 2% agarose was used to minimize variations of the bath electrode potential. The liquid junction potentials were measured according to Ref. 42Neher E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar and were corrected when necessary. All experiments were performed at room temperature (23–25 °C). ATP Release and Total ATP Assay—Bulk extracellular ATP concentration was measured by the luciferin-luciferase assay (ATP Luminescence Kit; AF-2L1, DKK-TOA Co., Tokyo, Japan) with an ATP analyzer (AF-100, DKK-TOA), as described previously (5Sabirov R.Z. Dutta A.K. Okada Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 251-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 6Dutta A.K. Okada Y. Sabirov R.Z. J. Physiol. (London). 2002; 542: 803-816Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, the cells were cultured to confluence in 12-well plates for time course experiments and in 24-well plates for end point steady-state ATP release measurements. Culture medium was totally replaced with isotonic Ringer solution (1000 μl for 12-well and 425 μl for 24-well plates, respectively). Cells were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C, and 100 μlofthe extracellular Ringer solution was removed and used as a control sample for background ATP release. A hypotonic challenge was then applied by gently removing most of the remaining extracellular solution (875 μl for 12-well and 300 μl for 24-well plates, respectively) and adding the hypotonic solution (1000 μl for 12-well and 400 μl for 24-well plates, respectively). The solution was gently mixed by careful rocking, and the plate was placed into the incubator at 37 °C. At the specified time points, the plate was carefully rocked again to ensure homogeneity of the extracellular solution, and samples (20 μl for 12-well and 50 μl for 24-well plate, respectively) were collected from each well for the luminometric ATP assay. ATP concentration was measured by mixing 20–50 μl of sample solution with 500 μl of normal Ringer solution and 50 μl of luciferin-luciferase reagent. At this ratio, ionic salt sensitivity of the luciferase reaction (43Boudreault F. Grygorczyk R. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C219-C226Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) was negligible. When required, drugs were added to the hypotonic solution to give the final concentrations as indicated. Since Gd3+ has been reported to interfere with the luciferase reaction (43Boudreault F. Grygorczyk R. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C219-C226Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we supplemented the luciferin/luciferase assay mixture with 600 μm EDTA when the samples contained Gd3+. Other drugs employed in the present study had no significant effect on the luciferin-luciferase reaction. Total ATP in cell lysates was quantified using a commercially available luciferin-luciferase assay kit (AF-2L1; DKK-TOA, Tokyo, Japan), as previously described (44Zamaraeva M.V. Sabirov R.Z. Maeno E. Ando-Akatsuka Y. Bessonova S.V. Okada Y. Cell Death. Differ. 2005; 12: 1390-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Data Analysis—Single channel amplitudes were measured by manually placing a cursor at the open and closed channel levels. The reversal potentials were calculated by fitting I-V curves to a second-order polynomial (2Sabirov R.Z. Okada Y. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 1672-1685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) or measured directly from ramp currents. Permeability ratios were calculated using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation as previously described (5Sabirov R.Z. Dutta A.K. Okada Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 251-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The value of PK/PCl was calculated from the KCl gradient experiments, and this was then used for Br–/Cl– and acetate/Cl– permeability ratio calculations. Data were analyzed in Origin 5–7 (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA). Pooled data are given as means ± S.E. of n observations. Statistical differences of the data were evaluated by analysis of variance and the paired or unpaired Student's t test where appropriate and considered significant at p < 0.05. Statistical differences in slopes of linear fits were evaluated by analysis of covariance using StatsDirect software (StatsDirect Ltd., Cheshire, UK) and considered significant at p < 0.05. Single Maxianion Channels in Wild-type Mouse Fibroblasts—In the cell-attached (on-cell) configuration, no single channel events were observed from wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (WT-MEFs). However, after excision of the patch membrane, single channel events with a large amplitude could be readily recorded (Fig. 1A). The channels exhibited voltage-dependent inactivation at both positive and negative potentials greater than ±20 mV. The unitary current-to-voltage (I-V) relationship was linear in the range of ±50 mV, with a reversal potential of about 0 mV in symmetrical conditions with Ringer solution in the bath and pipette and a slope conductance of 400.3 ± 3.8 pS (Fig. 1B). The single channel amplitude was insensitive to the replacement of NaCl with tetraethylammonium-Cl. However, the inward currents greatly decreased, and the reversal potential shifted to a negative value of –33.7 ± 1.6 mV when NaCl in the bath solution was replaced with sodium glutamate (Fig. 1B). This result indicates that the large conductance channel in WT-MEFs is anion-selective with a permeability ratio of glutamate/Cl– of 0.23 ± 0.02. This value is close to Pglutamate/PCl = 0.22 obtained for the maxianion channel in mammary C127 cells (4Sabirov R.Z. Okada Y. Purinerg. Signal. 2005; 1 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In order to test the ATP permeability of the maxianion channels in WT-MEFs, we recorded the I-V curves in response to ramp pulse from –50 to +50 mV. The ramp I-V relationship was linear in symmetric ionic conditions with Ringer solution both in the pipette and in the bath, with reversal potential at 0 mV. When all anions in the bath were replaced with 100 mm ATP4–, large outward currents (carried by Cl– from the pipette solution) as well as small inward currents (presumably carried by ATP4– from the bath solution (see Ref. 5Sabirov R.Z. Dutta A.K. Okada Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 251-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) were consistently observed. The average reversal potential shifted to –18.2 ± 1.2 mV (n = 15 from five different patches), giving PATP/PCl = 0.083 ± 0.005. The maxianion channel in WT-MEFs was insensitive to Gd3+ ions (50 μm) added from the intracellular side of excised patches (n = 5; data not shown) but completely blocked (n = 6) when the drug was applied from the extracellular side in the outside-out configuration (Fig. 1D). Another well known modulator of the maxianion channel, arachidonic acid (20 μm), potently inhibited the channel activity when added from the cytosolic side (n = 7; Fig. 1D). The biophysical properties of the WT-MEF maxianion channel, such as the single channel conductance, voltage-dependent inactivation, ATP permeability, and sensitivity to Gd3+ and arachidonate, are very similar to those observed previously in C127 cells (5Sabirov R.Z. Dutta A.K. Okada Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 251-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 6Dutta A.K. Okada Y. Sabirov R.Z. J. Physiol. (London). 2002; 542: 803-816Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar), kidney macula densa cells (7Bell P.D. Lapointe J.Y. Sabirov R. Hayashi S. Peti-Peterdi J. Manabe K. Kovacs G. Okada Y. Proc. Natl.

(London). 2004; 559: 799-812Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In a separate set of experiments, we determined the ionic selectivity of WT-MEF maxianion channels in conditions close to those commonly used for mitochondrial VDAC proteins reconstituted in lipid bilayers. When 10-fold KCl gradient (100 mm in the pipette versus 1000 mm in the bath) was applied to the maxianion channel-containing patches, the reversal potential was 40.6 ± 1.5 mV (Fig. 1B). This value is much greater than the value of 10.2 mV reported for the mitochondrial porin under the same conditions (45Blachly-Dyson E. Peng S. Colombini M. Forte M. Science. 1990; 247: 1233-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The calculated permeability ratio PCl/PK = 13.5 ± 2.3 also largely exceeded the PCl/PK of 1.7–1.9 for mitochondrial porins from different sources (45Blachly-Dyson E. Peng S. Colombini M. Forte M. Science. 1990; 247: 1233-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 46Colombini M. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 111: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Replacing 1000 mm KCl in the bath with equimolar KBr or potassium acetate resulted in the reversal potentials of 41.2 ± 1.5 and 28.6 ± 0.5 mV, respectively (Fig. 1B). The calculated permeability ratio PBr/PCl = 1.01 ± 0.06 was close to that for mitochondrial VDAC (1.02) as derived from the partitioned ionic conductances in Ref. 47Zizi M. Byrd C. Boxus R. Colombini M. Biophys. J. 1997; 75: 704-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (41) Google Scholar. However, Pacetate/PCl of 0.58 ± 0.01 was greater than Pacetate/PCl = 0.41 for mitochondrial VDAC (47Zizi M. Byrd C. Boxus R. Colombini M. Biophys. J. 1997; 75: 704-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (41) Google Scholar) under similar experimental conditions (both values were calculated after accounting for incomplete dissociation of potassium acetate at 1000 mm; see Ref. 47Zizi M. Byrd C. Boxus R. Colombini M. Biophys. J. 1997; 75: 704-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Effect of Deletion of VDAC Genes on the Occurrence of Maxianion Channels in Mouse Fibroblasts—The hypothesis that the maxianion channel is a plasmalemmal subtype of VDAC, as suggested by Buettner et al. (14Buettner R. Papoutsoglou G. Scemes E. Spray D.C. Dermietzel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3201-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), was based on the proposed existence of an alternative first exon in the murine vdac-1 gene. The hypothetical alternative exon encodes a leader peptide at the N terminus that targets the protein to the plasma membrane through the Golgi apparatus. Therefore, deleting the vdac gene would interrupt this process and consequently abolish plasmalemmal VDAC expression and maxianion channel activity. We have generated MEFs lacking the vdac1 gene and assayed the expression of VDAC1 protein using specific antibodies. Western blotting demonstrated a complete absence of VDAC1 protein in these cells (Fig. 2A, a). However, when the same cells were assayed electrophysiologically, they exhibited maxianion channel activity indistinguishable from WT-"

BCR-ABL displays constitutive tyrosine kinase activity, required for its transformation ability. Although the molecular mechanisms behind this malignancy are not fully understood, a role for phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase has been repeatedly described. Here we report the specific up-regulation of the class IB catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase (p110γ) in response to BCR-ABL expression. We demonstrate that this upregulation is due to increased transcription and is dependent on both PI 3-kinase and MEK activity. We performed in vitro kinase activity assays and show that BCR-ABL also leads to increased p110γ activity and that this activation requires both G protein-coupled receptor and Ras signaling. In addition, by transfection of cells with dominant negative p110γ, we determined that this specific PI 3-kinase isoform is involved in both proliferation and the apoptosis resistance associated with chronic myeloid leukemia. The data presented here define for the first time the ability of BCR-ABL to alter the expression levels of PI 3-kinase isoforms and also demonstrate a previously unreported link between BCR-ABL and p110γ.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) 2The abbreviations used are: CML, chronic myeloid leukemia; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; PI, phosphoinositide; PI3K, PI 3-kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; FTS, S-trans,trans-farnesylthiosalicyclic acid; RT, reverse transcription; MBP, myelin basic protein, ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. is a clonal disorder of the hematopoietic system that results in the excessive accumulation of immature and mature myeloid cells. The cytogenetic cause of CML is the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) (1Rowley J.D. Virchows Arch. B Cell Pathol. 1978; 29: 57-63PubMed Google Scholar). This results from a translocation between breakpoint cluster region (BCR) and ABL genes on chromosomes 22 and 9, respectively. Depending on the breakpoint within the BCR gene, the fusion protein may be either 210 kDa (p210) or 185 kDa in size (2Shtivelman E. Lifshitz B. Gale R.P. Roe B.A. Canaani E. Cell. 1986; 47: 277-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The p210 form of the BCR-ABL fusion protein is seen in 95% of all CML cases. ABL, which normally encodes a tyrosine kinase, becomes constitutively active when fused to BCR (3Groffen J. Stephenson J.R. Heisterkamp N. de Klein A. Bartram C.R. Grosveld G. Cell. 1984; 36: 93-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). This constitutive tyrosine kinase activity is crucial for the transforming ability of the BCR-ABL oncogene (4Lugo T.G. Pendergast A.M. Muller A.J. Witte O.N. Science. 1990; 247: 1079-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). CML progresses from an initial chronic phase characterized by the accumulation of apparently normal myeloid precursors and mature cells to an acute phase associated with a poor prognosis. The acute phase is marked by the clonal expansion of differentiation-arrested myeloid precursor cells. The sole curative treatment for CML is allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, which is available only to a very small number of patients. It is hoped that the identification of new genes and signaling pathways associated with BCR-ABL expression will potentially lead to new molecular targets for therapy. BCR-ABL has been reported to activate numerous signal transduction pathways, normally activated by receptor-tyrosine kinases, including the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (5Skorski T.

Perussia B. Calabretta B. Blood. 1995; 86: 726-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular it has been demonstrated that PI3K activity is required not only for BCR-ABL-mediated survival but also for the growth of CML cells (10Skorski T. Bellacosa A. Nieborowska-Skorska M.

PI3Ks represent a family of cytosolic, intracellular signaling proteins involved in the regulation of several cellular functions including proliferation and differentiation (11Kapeller R.

Nature. 1988; 332: 644-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar), which have been reported to act as second messengers (16Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). PI3Ks can be divided into three main classes (I-III). These classes are based on their in vitro substrate specificity, structure, and probable mode of regulation. Class I PI3Ks are further categorized into one of two subclasses, IA or IB. In general, class IA PI3Ks are heterodimers consisting of an 85-kDa regulatory subunit and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit. PI3Kγ is the only class IB member of the PI3Ks. This enzyme is also composed of a 110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110γ), but in contrast to the class IA members, it associates with a p101 adaptor molecule. In general, class IA PI3Ks are reported to be activated by receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases and small G proteins. Conversely p110γ has been reported to be activated by the α and βγ subunits released upon activation of G protein-coupled receptors (17Kerchner K.R. Clay R.L. McCleery G. Watson N. McIntire W.E.

However, G protein-coupled receptors have also been shown to activate p85-dependent PI3Ks in human vascular smooth muscle cells (19Hu Z.W. Shi X.Y. Lin R.Z. Hoffman B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8977-8982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and it has been demonstrated that Gβγ can activate p110β (20Maier U. Babich A. Nurnberg B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29311-29317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). BCR-ABL has been shown to interact indirectly with the p85 regulatory subunit of class IA PI3Ks (21Jain S.K. Susa M. Keeler M.L. Carlesso N. Druker B. Varticovski L. Blood. 1996; 88: 1542-1550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, to date PI3Kγ has not been implicated in transformation by BCR-ABL or in the pathogenesis of CML. A potential role for PI3Kγ is substantiated by the fact that cDNA encoding p110γ was first isolated from human myeloid cells (22Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Dhand R. Nurnberg B. Gierschik P. Seedorf K. Hsuan J.J. Waterfield M.D. Wetzker R. Science. 1995; 269: 690-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) and is also preferentially expressed in cells of the hematopoietic lineage (23Ho L.K. Liu D. Rozycka M. Brown R.A. Fry M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 130-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to investigate the affect that ectopic expression of BCR-ABL has on the expression levels of different PI3Ks. We demonstrate that transcription of the p110γ gene is selectively upregulated in response to p210 BCR-ABL in 32D cells transfected with BCR-ABL and also in K562 and Lama-84 CML cell lines. Analysis of this up-regulation shows that it is dependent on both MEK and PI3K activities but occurs independently of Ras, Raf, and PKC. The increased level of p110γ expression in BCR-ABL-positive cells is accompanied by an increase in both the lipid and protein kinase activities of this enzyme. Transfection of cells with dnp110γ reveals that its activity contributes to the proliferation and apoptosis resistance of these cells. These data not only provide insights into the regulation of p110γ expression and activation but also identify a novel downstream target of BCR-ABL, involved in the drug resistance of CML cells (22Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Dhand R. Nurnberg B. Gierschik P. Seedorf K. Hsuan J.J. Waterfield M.D. Wetzker R. Science. 1995; 269: 690-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—The 32D and empty vector cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) with 10% WEHI-conditioned media as a source of IL-3. The BCR-ABL-expressing C4 clone was maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 0.2 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich). C4 cells treated with STI571 were cultured in the presence of 10% WEHI-conditioned media. C4 cells transfected with dnp110γ (K832R) were maintained in media supplemented with 250 μg/ml G418 sulfate (Geneticin, Sigma-Aldrich). K562, Lama-84, and HeLa cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 200 μm l-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich). 20 ng/ml recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the media of K562 and Lama-84 cells treated with STI571. All cultures were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 1 mg/ml streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich). The pcDNA3 vector encoding dominant negative p110γ (K832R) was kindly provided by Dr. R. Wetzker (University of Jena, Jena, Germany). Transfection of C4 cells was achieved by electroporation using a Gene Pulser apparatus (Bio-Rad). Stably transfected clones were obtained by serial dilution in media containing 700 μg/ml G418. HeLa cells were transiently transfected using Effectene transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen Ltd., Crawley, UK). Reagents—Radiochemicals were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. STI571 was kindly provided by Novartis, Basel, Switzerland; etoposide (VP-16) and actinomycin D were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich; S-trans,trans-farnesylthiosalicyclic acid (FTS) was obtained from Affiniti Research Products (Exeter, UK); UO126 was from Cell Signaling Technology, Hertfordshire, UK); LY294002, pertussis toxin, 8-bromo-cAMP, staurosporine, and protein kinase C inhibitor set (bisindolylmaleimide I, calphostin C, chelerythrine chloride, Gö 6976, PKC inhibitor 20–28, Ro 032–0432) were purchased from Calbiochem. Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR—Total cellular RNA was prepared using Tri Reagent (Biosciences, Dublin, Ireland). Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized according to the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase protocol (Promega, Southampton, UK). Oligo(dT), MgCl2, and RNasin were also purchased from Promega. dNTPs were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. cDNA was amplified using Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR reactions were carried out as follows: 95 °C for 5 min and 13–30 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, Tanneal for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min followed by 72 °C for 5 min. Primers were p110α (forward, 5′-gcaaccgtgaagaaaagatcctcaatcga-3′ reverse, 5′-caacaacatgctccgagtctttttcctga-3′; Tanneal 65 °C, 357-bp product), p110β (forward, 5′-atccaaccttcctctccctttaccaccaa-3′, reverse, 5′-tccagacctcagctgtcctttgaagtca-3′, Tanneal 65 °C, 414-bp product), p110δ (forward, 5′-gtcaagctcggaggtgaatgtatgctca-3′, reverse, 5′-gatcttctccagagcggggaagtacaca-3′, Tanneal 65 °C, 372-bp product), p110γ (forward, 5′-gctcttggcagaaaaaggtg-3′, reverse, 5′-cctgggcatctcagtggtat-3′, Tanneal 55 °C, 169-bp product), p101 (forward, 5′-aactacaccgcaaacttcagtccaa-3′, reverse, 5′-ctggttccagctgtaggtgtagcat-3′, Tanneal 60 °C, 352-bp product), 18 S rRNA (forward, 5′-cgaggccctgtaattgga-3′, reverse, 5′-gtttcccgtgttgagtca-3′, Tanneal 56 °C, 715-bp product), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (forward, 5′-accacagtccatgccatcac-3′, reverse, 5′-tccaccacccagttgctgta-3′, Tanneal 58 °C, 450-bp product). To control for DNA contamination of RNA samples, PCR was also carried out in the absence of reverse transcription (–RT in Figs. 1a and 7a); in this case Moloney murine leukemia virus was omitted from the reverse transcription reaction. Control reactions were performed initially to ensure linearity of amplification over the number of cycles used. Real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed using SYBR Green I on a LightCycler instrument (Roche Diagnostics). Primer sequences and PCR conditions were used as above.FIGURE 7Expression levels of the adaptor molecule p101 are not altered in BCR-ABL expressing cells. a, RT-PCR experiments using cDNA from 32D, untreated C4 cells, and C4 cells treated for 48 h with 1 μm STI571 (STI) show expression levels of p101 in the presence (+RT) and absence (–RT) of reverse transcription. Levels of 18s rRNA PCR product demonstrate equal quantities of cDNA. b, Western blot analysis of expression of p101 in total cell lysates from 32D, untreated (Unt) C4 cells, and C4 cells treated for 48 h with 1 μm STI571.

The lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g (4 °C) for 15 min to remove insoluble debris. Equivalent amounts of protein, as determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay, were resolved using SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schüll). All secondary antibodies were peroxidase-conjugated, and proteins were detected using Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies were anti-PI3K p110γ, anti-phospho-AKT (Ser-473), and anti-AKT (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-PI3K p110α and anti-PI3K p110β (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany), anti-PI3K p110δ (Calbiochem), anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20) (Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA), anti-p101 (Upstate Biotechnology Ltd., Milton Keynes, UK), anti-β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich). Kinase Assays—Ras activity was measured using the Ras activation assay kit from Upstate Biotechnology and following the manufacturer's instructions. GTP-bound Ras from cell lysates was “pulled down” using the GST fusion protein corresponding to the Ras binding domain of Raf-1, bound to agarose. The presence of active Ras was detected by Western blotting using the anti-Ras antibody. Raf-1 kinase assay was performed using the Raf-1 kinase cascade assay kit from Upstate Biotechnology according to the manufacturer's instructions. Raf-1 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, and kinase activity was measured using MEK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and myelin basic protein (MBP) as sequential substrates. MEK kinase assays were performed essentially as the Raf-1 kinase assay with some modifications. MEK was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, and kinase activity was measured using ERK and MBP as sequential substrates. Assay products for Raf-1 and MEK assays were assessed using P81 phosphocellulose paper (Upstate Biotechnology) and counting on a Beckman Coulter LS 6500 scintillation counter. p110γ lipid kinase assays were performed using the PI3K enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit from Echelon Biosciences Inc (Salt Lake City, UT) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein phosphorylation was assayed essentially according to Stoyanova et al. (24Stoyanova S. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Kirsch C. Hanck T. Klinger R. Wetzker R. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) with MBP used as a substrate rather than the measurement of autophosphorylation. Briefly, p110γ was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and washed twice with kinase buffer without ATP (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.01% Triton X-100) and resuspended in kinase buffer supplemented with ATP to give a final concentration of 20 μm and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP per sample and MBP at a final concentration of 20 μg/sample. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 min at 30 °C. Assay products were assessed using P81 phosphocellulose paper (Upstate Biotechnology) and counting on a Beckman Coulter LS 6500 scintillation counter. PCR—Genomic DNA was extracted from cells using Gen Elute mammalian genomic DNA miniprep kit (Sigma-Aldrich). PCR reactions to confirm the presence of pcDNA3 plasmid were carried out as follows: 95 °C for 5 min and 35 cycles of –95 °C for 1 min, 63 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min followed by 72 °C for 5 min. Primers were 5′-tcagaggtggcgaaacccgaca-3′ forward and 5′-gcgcgtaatctgctgcttgcaa-3′ reverse; the product was 498 bp. DNA was amplified using native Taq DNA polymerase (Stratagene, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). Electrophoresis was carried out using 1.5% agarose gels containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide, and DNA was visualized under UV light. Cell Proliferation Assay—Cells were plated at a density of 0.2 × 106 cells/ml. Cell numbers from aliquots of time course experiments were determined by trypan blue exclusion assay using a Neubauer hemocytometer. Measurement of Apoptosis (Phosphatidylserine Exposure)—The exposure of phosphatidylserine on the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane was monitored by the binding of annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate according to the manufacturer's instructions (IQ Products, Labron Ltd., Dublin, Ireland). Briefly, 5 × 105/ml cells were resuspended in calcium binding buffer (10 mm Hepes, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 140 mm NaCl) and incubated with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate for 5 min at room temperature in the dark. Cells were incubated with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide at room temperature before analysis. Fluorescence resulting from fluorescein isothiocyanate and propidium iodide was measured at 530 nm (FL1) and 590 nm (FL2) respectively and analyzed using Cellquest software on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using an excitation of 488 nm. Expression of p110γ Is Selectively Increased in Cells Transfected with p210 BCR-ABL—PI3K has been implicated downstream of BCR-ABL in studies from both mouse (25Roumiantsev S. de Aos I.E. Varticovski L. Ilaria R.L. Van Etten R.A. Blood. 2001; 97: 4-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and cell line models (9Skorski T. Kanakaraj P. Nieborowska-Skorska M. Ratajczak M.Z.

Machii T. Wakao H. Kanakura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8076-8082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) of CML. It has also been shown recently that PI3K inhibitors can synergize with STI571 to inhibit the growth of human CML cells (27Klejman A. Rushen L. Morrione A. Slupianek A. Skorski T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5868-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, very little is known about the specific PI3K isoforms involved in signaling downstream of BCR-ABL. In particular, the affect of BCR-ABL on expression of PI3K isoforms has not been studied. Microarrays were previously carried out by our group comparing 32D cells (murine IL-3-dependent myeloid progenitor cells) with a transfected clone of this cell line expressing high levels of p210 BCR-ABL (C4). Transfection of these cells with BCR-ABL has been shown to render them growth factor-independent and also to increase their resistance to cytotoxic drug-induced apoptosis (28Keeshan K. Mills K.I. Cotter T.G. McKenna S.L. Leukemia. 2001; 15: 1823-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Results from microarray comparisons revealed that the class IB PI3K isoform p110γ is expressed at an increased level in C4 cells compared with the parental 32D cell line. RT-PCR was used to confirm this increase in p110γ expression and also to investigate the possibility that the expression of other PI3K catalytic subunits is altered by BCR-ABL. Fig. 1a demonstrates that p110γ mRNA is in fact expressed at a higher level in C4 cells than 32D cells, as had been shown by microarray results. It was found that ectopic expression of BCR-ABL does not affect the level of expression of either class IA isoforms p110α or p110β. Expression of the third class IA isoform p110δ was found to be increased in C4 cells, similar to p110γ. STI571 (Gleevec) is a specific inhibitor of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity (29Carroll M. Ohno-Jones S. Tamura S. Buchdunger E. Zimmermann J. Lydon N.B. Gilliland D.G. Druker B.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 4947-4952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When C4 cells are treated with 1 μm STI571 for 48 h, the phenotype reverted to that of 32D cells. That is, levels of phosphotyrosine are reduced, and the cells become dependent on interleukin-3 for survival (data not shown). This treatment does not result in significant cytotoxicity, as determined by annexin V/propidium iodide staining (Fig. 1b). As such, STI571 was used to confirm that differences between 32D and C4 cells are in fact due to the tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL. Indeed, treatment of C4 cells with STI571 resulted in a decrease in the levels of expression of both p110γ and p110δ mRNA (Fig. 1a). The increased p110γ mRNA seen in C4 cells is reflected by an increased level of p110γ protein as seen by Western blotting of whole cell lysates from 32D and C4 cells (Fig. 1c). It is also shown that treatment with STI571 results in a decrease in levels of p110γ protein in C4 cells. As was observed at the mRNA level, no difference was seen in the level of expression of p110α or p110β protein in C4 cells. In addition, levels of p110δ protein were found to be equivalent between 32D and C4 cells even though an increase in mRNA was seen. No increase in p110γ protein was seen in empty vector-transfected 32D cells, confirming that the up-regulation of p110γ does not occur as a result of transfection alone but is dependent on BCR-ABL expression (Fig. 1d). These results demonstrate that expression of the PI3K catalytic isoform p110γ is selectively increased by p210 BCR-ABL. p110γ Expression Is Also Increased in K562 and Lama-84 Cells in a BCR-ABL-dependent Manner—To confirm that the increase in p110γ expression seen in C4 cells is not unique to this cell line, levels of p110γ were analyzed in two additional CML cell lines, K562 and Lama-84. K562 is an erythroleukemia cell line derived from a chronic myeloid leukemia patient in blast crisis (30Lozzio C.B. Lozzio B.B. Blood. 1975; 45: 321-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lama-84 is a chronic myeloid leukemia cell line established from the peripheral blood of a patient 1 month after the onset of blast crisis (31Seigneurin D. Champelovier P. Mouchiroud G. Berthier R. Leroux D. Prenant M. McGregor J. Starck J. Morle F. Micouin C. Pietrantuono A. Kolodie L. Exp. Hematol. 1987; 15: 822-832PubMed Google Scholar). Both cell lines were treated with STI571 for 24 h to inhibit BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity. Concentrations of STI571 were chosen for each cell line that resulted in a complete reduction in phosphotyrosine levels as determined by PY-20 antibody binding (Fig. 2a). We also determined by propidium iodide uptake on a FACScan flow cytometer that these concentrations were not significantly cytotoxic to the cells (data not shown). It was found by Western blotting of whole cell lysates that both cell lines expressed p110γ and that the expression level of this protein was reduced by treatment with STI571. In addition, it is shown that treatment of both cell lines with STI571 had no affect on the level of expression of p110β or p110δ (Fig. 2b). We were unable to detect expression of the remaining PI3K catalytic subunit, p110α, in either cell line. These results confirm in two human CML cell lines the results seen in C4 cells, i.e. that expression of the p110γ isoform of PI3K is specifically up-regulated by BCR-ABL in a tyrosine kinase-dependent manner. Increased p110γ Expression in C4 Cells Is Due to Increased Transcription—We have observed in C4 cells that increased p110γ protein is due to increased mRNA. Inhibition of the decay of cytoplasmic mRNA is a common mechanism employed in cells to induce a net increase in an mRNA species. To investigate the possibility that this mechanism was employed in C4 cells, both 32D and C4 cells were treated with actinomycin D, an inhibitor of de novo transcription. RNA was extracted from cells at 0, 4, 8, and 12 h, and the remaining fractions of p110γ mRNA were determined by real-time RT-PCR. Fig. 3a demonstrates that there is no difference in the stability of p110γ mRNA between 32D and C4 cells. This excludes the possibility that inhibition of mRNA decay is responsible for the increased level of p110γ mRNA seen in C4 cells. These results favor a direct transcriptional mechanism of BCR-ABL-dependent p110γ expression. The Up-regulation of p110γ in C4 Cells Is Dependent on PI3K and MEK Activity but Independent of Ras—The ability of p210 BCR-ABL to up-regulate the expression of p110γ represents a novel and potentially important downstream affect of this oncogene. As such, we aimed to determine the pathways and signaling molecules required for this upregulation. C4 cells were treated for 48 h with 20 μm LY294002 or 10 μm FTS or for 24 h with the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2-specific MEK1/2 inhibitor, UO126 (5 μm) to investigate the involvement of the signaling molecules PI3K, Ras, and MEK, respectively. These molecules were chosen due to their reported involvement in transformation by BCR-ABL (26Sonoyama J. Matsumura I. Ezoe S. Satoh Y. Zhang X. Kataoka Y. Takai E. Mizuki M. Machii T. Wakao H. Kanakura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8076-8082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 32Hoover R.R. Gerlach M.J. Koh E.Y. Daley G.Q.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7774-7780Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It was found that treatment of C4 cells with both LY294002 and UO126 resulted in a down-regulation in the expression of p110γ (Fig. 4a). This indicates that downstream of BCR-ABL, both PI3K and MEK activities are required for the increased expression of p110γ. The farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTS) did not affect p110γ protein levels, suggesting that Ras signaling is not involved in the up-regulation of p110γ expression in response to BCR-ABL. For each of the inhibitors used, it was confirmed that the activity of the target molecule was in fact reduced. This was achieved by the use of a Ras activity assay (Fig. 4c) and a MEK activity assay (Fig. 4d), and in the case of PI3K, Western blot analysis of levels of AKT phosphorylation (ser473) were used as an indicator of PI3K activity (Fig. 4b).

https://openalex.org/W2053804917,"The basal level of the tumor suppressor p53 is regulated by MDM2-mediated ubiquitination at specific lysines, which leads to p53 nuclear export and degradation. Upon p53 activation, however, these lysines become acetylated by p300/CREB-binding protein. Here we have reported an unexpected finding that p300-mediated acetylation also regulates p53 subcellular localization and can promote cytoplasmic localization of p53. This activity is independent of MDM2 but requires a p53 nuclear export signal and acetylation of multiple lysines by p300. Mechanistically, we showed that conversion of a minimal four of these lysines to alanines but not arginines mimics p300-mediated p53 nuclear export, and these lysine-neutralizing mutations effectively prevent p53 tetramerization, thus exposing the oligomerization-regulated nuclear export signal. Our study suggested a threshold mechanism whereby the degree of acetylation regulates p53 nucleus-cytoplasm trafficking by neutralizing a lysine-dependent charge patch, which in turn, controls oligomerization-dependent p53 nuclear export.

Our study suggested a threshold mechanism whereby the degree of acetylation regulates p53 nucleus-cytoplasm trafficking by neutralizing a lysine-dependent charge patch, which in turn, controls oligomerization-dependent p53 nuclear export. The tumor suppressor p53 plays critical roles in protecting cells from malignant transformation. Upon its activation in response to a variety of stress stimuli, p53 becomes stabilized and accumulates in the nucleus and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (1Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). Due to its potent growth inhibition and pro-apoptotic activity, p53 is normally kept latent and at low levels in unstressed cells by its negative regulator MDM2. MDM2 represses p53, in part, by promoting p53 degradation and nuclear export through catalyzing p53 poly- and monoubiquitination on specific lysine residues (2Yang Y. Li C.C. Weissman A.M. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2096-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Although polyubiquitinated p53 is targeted to proteasome for degradation, the exact mechanism by which monoubiquitination promotes p53 nuclear export is not understood. In contrast to MDM2 mediated-ubiquitination, acetylation has been positively linked to both p53 transcriptional activity and p53 stability (reviewed in Refs. 3Prives C. Manley J.L.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6236-6245Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). It is unclear why so many lysines are modified by acetylation. Nor is it known whether the acetylation of the lysines provides a functional moiety for protein-protein interaction or serves to modify the conformation of p53. One clue as to the function of p53 acetylation lies in the potentially interesting links between acetylation and ubiquitination. Both the acetylation and the ubiquitination machinery modify the ϵ amino group of the lysine residue. Furthermore, acetylation and ubiquitination occur on a common set of lysine residues at the C terminus of p53 (7Ito A. Kawaguchi Y. Lai C.H. Kovacs J.J. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Yao T.P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6236-6245Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and p300/CBP-mediated acetylation might functionally antagonize one another to control p53 activity.

Recent studies have highlighted the importance of intracellular trafficking in the regulation of p53 activity (8Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M.

Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). It is known that p53 actively shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm via a mechanism that involves a nuclear export signal (NES) and its receptor Crm-1 (reviewed in Ref. 11Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 886: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Although its importance is apparent, little is known about how p53 nuclear export is regulated. Recent studies have indicated that the oligomeric status of p53 may control the accessibility of NES to the export machinery (8Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Biochemical and structural studies revealed that the C-terminal NES is normally exposed in the inactive monomeric or dimeric forms of p53 that are subject to active nuclear export. Upon its conversion to the active tetrameric form, however, the C-terminal NES becomes buried and inaccessible, resulting in p53 nuclear retention. At present, it is not understood how the oligomerization status of p53 is regulated in response to specific stress signals or modifications, such as ubiquitination. Here we have presented evidence that lysine acetylation is a novel mechanism that controls p53 oligomerization and subcellular trafficking. We found that p53 hyperacetylation leads to cytoplasmic accumulation of endogenous p53 in response to p53-activating agents. We further showed that overexpression of p300 stimulates cytoplasmic accumulation of p53 in an acetylation-dependent but MDM2-independent manner. Mechanistically, we have provided evidence suggesting that acetylation promotes the nuclear export of p53 by neutralizing the “charge patch” created by the C-terminal lysine residues. The charge neutralization of the C-terminal lysines prevented p53 oligomerization and therefore exposed the p53 NES, allowing efficient p53 export. The requirement of multiple modified lysines for efficient export suggested a potential threshold mechanism wherein the acetylation level of p53 serves as a signal that promotes p53 export to the cytoplasm. Cell Lines and Transfection—H1299 human cells, p53(–/minus]), MDM2(–/minus]) mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells, and A549 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. All cells were grown at 37 °C in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. All transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate method as described previously (12Eckner R. Yao T.P. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Plasmids—Wild type human p53 cDNA, wild type human MDM2, wild type human Myc-p300, and human p300DY mutants were described previously (5Ito A. Lai C.H. Zhao X. Saito S. Hamilton M.H. Appella E. Yao T.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). p53-5KR and -6KR mutants were generated using site-directed mutagenesis, changing lysines 320, 370, 372, 373, 381, and 382 to arginines. P53-2KA, -3KA, -4KA, and -5KA mutants were also constructed using site-directed mutagenesis to exchange the lysines to alanines. p53-NES(–) mutants were also constructed using site-directed mutagenesis to change the leucines (amino acids 348 and 350) to alanines. Immunofluorescence—For immunofluorescence staining, cells grown on a glass coverslip were transfected with 0.1 μg of p53 and 1 μg of Myc epitope-tagged p300 expression plasmids. Immunostaining was performed as described (12Eckner R. Yao T.P. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) using anti-p53 rabbit polyclonal antibody (FL-393, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-HDAC1 monoclonal antibody (H-11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 and anti-MDM2 monoclonal antibody SMP-14 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Hoechst 33258 was used to visualize the nucleus. Fractionation, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—The cells were homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer in buffer (25 mm Hepes-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 5 μm deacetylase inhibitor TSA (Sigma) and protease inhibitors. After centrifugation at 960 × g for 5 min, nuclei pellets were washed with the homogenizer buffer and then lysed in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane) supplemented with 5 μm trichostatin A and protease inhibitors. Lysates were centrifuged at 5000 × g for 5 min to obtain supernatants of the nuclear fraction. Meanwhile, NaCl and Nonidet P-40 were added to cytoplasmic supernatants to bring the concentrations up to 150 mm and 1%, respectively. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (5Ito A. Lai C.H. Zhao X. Saito S. Hamilton M.H. Appella E. Yao T.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Proteins were detected with one of the following antibodies: anti-human p53 antibody (Ab-6, Calbiochem), anti-human acetylated (Lys-373) p53 antibody and anti-human acetylated (Lys-382) p53 antibody (Calbiochem); anti-α-tubulin antibody (DM1A, Sigma); or anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) antibody (Roche Applied Science). Protein Production and Oligomerization Assay—Wild type, 3KA, 4KA, or 4KR p53 C-terminal DNA (amino acid 326–393) including the tetramerization domain was cloned into pGEX-6P-1 vectors. GST fusion constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli and then purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) and cleaved with Precission protease (Amersham Biosciences). The oligomerization assay was performed as described previously (8Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Acetylation Regulates Subcellular Localization of p53—We have previously shown that p53 becomes acetylated by p300/CBP upon cellular stresses (5Ito A. Lai C.H. Zhao X. Saito S. Hamilton M.H. Appella E. Yao T.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). As p53 activation is accompanied by its accumulation in the nucleus, we asked whether p300-mediated acetylation regulates p53 subcellular localization. To test this, we transfected p53-null H1299 cells with expression plasmids for p53 and p300 and then examined p53 subcellular localization. As shown in Fig. 1A, panel a, when expressed alone, p53 resides almost exclusively in the nucleus. To our surprise, upon co-expression with p300, p53 localized to both the nucleus and the cytoplasm in the majority of the cells expressing both transfected p53 and transfected p300 (Fig. 1, A, panel b, and B). Cell counts demonstrated that up to 84% of the cells that expressed both p53 and p300 showed cytoplasmic accumulation of p53 (Fig. 1B). To determine whether the accumulation of p53 in the cytoplasm requires p300 activity, we examined whether an acetyltransferase-deficient p300DY mutant (5Ito A. Lai C.H. Zhao X. Saito S. Hamilton M.H. Appella E. Yao T.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) could affect the subcellular localization of p53. As shown in Fig. 1, A, panel c, and B, unlike wild type p300, the acetyltransferase-deficient p300DY mutant did not stimulate p53 accumulation in the cytoplasm. As expected, both p300 and p300DY are localized to the nucleus (Fig. 1A, panels h, i, j, and l), and neither p300 nor the p300DY mutant had an effect on the levels of p53 under the experimental conditions (Fig. 1D) (5Ito A. Lai C.H. Zhao X. Saito S. Hamilton M.H. Appella E. Yao T.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Together, these results indicate that p300-mediated cytoplasmic accumulation of p53 requires p300-acetyltransferase activity. As p53 subcellular localization is regulated by active nuclear export, we investigated whether acetylation-dependent p53 accumulation in the cytoplasm is dependent on the activation of the nuclear export machinery. As shown in Fig. 1A, panel d, and B, the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB) efficiently blocked the cytoplasmic accumulation of p53 induced by p300. We also evaluated the subcellular localization of a p53 mutant, the C-terminal NES (8Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar) of which is inactivated. As shown in Fig. 1A, panel e, and B, when expressed alone, NES mutant p53 is localized to the nucleus, similar to wild type p53. However, unlike wild type p53, NES mutant did not accumulate in the cytoplasm in response to p300 expression and remained in the nucleus (Fig. 1A, panel f, and B). Importantly, wild type and NES mutant p53 are acetylated to comparable levels. These results demonstrated that p300-mediated cytoplasmic accumulation of p53 requires the C-terminal NES and suggested that acetylation enhances p53 nuclear export. To further verify the conclusions from the immunolocalization study, we determined the subcellular localization of p53 by biochemical fractionation. As shown in Fig. 1C, p53 is normally a nuclear protein (lanes 1 and 2). However, co-expression of wild type p300, but not the p300DY mutant, induced a marked accumulation (25% of the total p53) of the p53 protein in the cytoplasmic fraction (compare lanes 2, 4, and 6). The p300-dependent cytoplasmic accumulation of p53 could again be largely reversed by LMB treatment (lane 8). These results are in agreement with the data obtained from the immunolocalization, providing further evidence that p300-mediated acetylation affects subcellular localization of p53. The presence of acetylated p53 in the cytoplasmic fraction suggests that p53 can be exported to the cytoplasm after being acetylated (Fig. 1C). Lastly, we asked whether endogenous p53 accumulates in the cytoplasm during stress stimuli. As shown in Fig. 1E, we observed significant accumulation of endogenous p53 in the cytoplasm in response to UV irradiation or hypoxia when deacetylation of p53 is suppressed (Fig. 1E, compare panels b and d with panels a and c). In agreement with immunolocalization analysis, subcellular fractionation assays also reveal significant accumulation of endogenous p53 in the cytoplasm in response to UV irradiation (Fig. 1F, lane 3). Importantly, cytoplasmic p53 induced by UV irradiation is acetylated, as it can be recognized by an antibody specific for the acetylated p53 (Fig. 1F, lane 3, upper panel). Together, these results support the conclusion that hyperacetylation of p53 leads to its accumulation in the cytoplasm. p300-mediated Cytoplasmic Accumulation of p53 Is Independent of MDM2—It was reported that MDM2 stimulates p53 nuclear export by promoting p53 ubiquitination (13Geyer R.K. Yu Z.K. Maki C.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 14Boyd S.D. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). As p300 functionally interacts with MDM2 (15Grossman S.R. Perez M. Kung A.L. Joseph M. Mansur C. Xiao Z.X. Kumar S. Howley P.M. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), we determined whether p300-induced cytoplasmic accumulation of p53 requires MDM2. To test this idea, we expressed p53 alone or together with p300 in MDM2-deficient MEF cells (16McMasters K.M. Montes de Oca Luna R. Pena J.R. Lozano G. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1731-1736PubMed Google Scholar) and assessed p53 subcellular localization. As shown in Fig. 2A, in the absence of MDM2, p300 is still capable of stimulating the cytoplasmic accumulation of p53. In fact, more than 90% of cells overexpressing p300 showed p53 in cytoplasm, which is similar to the effect induced by MDM2 (Fig. 2B). This result indicates that p300-mediated cytoplasmic accumulation of p53 is independent of MDM2. C-terminal Lysine Residues Are Required for Efficient Acetylation-induced Cytoplasmic Accumulation of p53—The results presented so far have supported the idea that p300 affects subcellular localization of p53 in an acetylation-dependent manner, likely by directly acetylating p53. To further investigate this possibility, we determined whether lysine residues known to be acetylated by p300 are required for acetylation-induced cytoplasmic accumulation of p53. We therefore mutated multiple lysines to arginines (5KR and 6KR, Fig. 3A) that are known targets of acetylation by p300 (7Ito A. Kawaguchi Y. Lai C.H. Kovacs J.J. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Yao T.P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6236-6245Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) and evaluated the subcellular distribution of these mutants in response to p300. As shown in Fig. 3B, when expressed alone, the localization of these p53 KR mutants is almost entirely nuclear and indistinguishable from wild type p53. However, in response to ectopically expressed p300, the number of cells that show a cytoplasmic accumulation of the 5KR (51%) and 6KR (30%) p53 mutants is markedly reduced when compared with that of wild type p53 (84%). These data indicated that the lysine residues acetylated by p300 are required for p53 nuclear exit in response to p300. Neutralization of Positively Charged Lysine Residues in the C Terminus Regulates Subcellular Localization of p53—It was previously shown that acetylation in histone H2A.Z works by neutralizing the charge conferred by multiple lysine residues (17Ren Q. Gorovsky M.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1329-1335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). As acetylation also targets multiple lysine residues in p53, we asked whether acetylation promotes p53 nuclear exit by a similar mechanism. To test this, we generated charge-neutralizing mutations by converting lysine residues known to be acetylated and ubiquitinated to alanine, either individually or in combination, and evaluated their subcellular localization. As shown in Fig. 4, the subcellular localization of the 2KA and several 3KA (3KA-1, 3KA-2, and 3KA-3) mutants is similar to that of wild type p53 and is mostly nuclear (Fig. 4, B and C). In contrast, when four lysine residues are mutated in three different combinations (4KA-1, 4KA-2, and 4KA-3), these p53 mutants clearly began to accumulate in the cytoplasm. The conversion of five lysine residues (5KA) led to a further increase in the number of cells with cytoplasmic p53 staining (Fig. 4, B and C). The cytoplasmic localization of the 4KA-1, 4KA-2, 4KA-3, and 5KA p53 mutants was observed in 51, 52, 48, and 64% of transfected cells, respectively, when compared with 19% for wild type p53 (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, the intensity of the wild type p53 protein detected in the cytoplasm was much weaker than that of the 4KA and 5KA mutants (data not shown). Importantly, cytoplasmic p53 4KA and 5KA mutants can be effectively eliminated upon treatment with LMB (Fig. 4, B and C), supporting the idea that nuclear export is required for cytoplasmic accumulation of the 4KA and 5KA p53 mutants. Together, these observations indicate that the degree of p53 cytoplasmic accumulation is proportional to the number of lysine residues neutralized and suggest that acetylation modulates p53 subcellular localization by modifying the positive charge of specific lysine residues at the C terminus of p53. C-terminal Lysine Charge Determines the Oligomerization Status of p53—The accessibility of the C-terminal NES to the export machinery has been shown to be regulated by the oligomerization status of p53 (8Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). We therefore assessed whether modification of the lysine charge activates p53 export by regulating p53 oligomerization status. Based on the observation that the conversion of at least four but not three lysines to alanines promotes p53 cytoplasmic accumulation, recombinant wild type, 3KA, and 4KA (4KA-1, 4KA-2, and 4KA-3, Fig. 4A) mutant polypeptides encompassing the entire p53 tetramerization domain and lysine-rich C terminus (amino acids 326–393) were tested for their ability to oligomerize. A mutant p53 with four lysines converted to arginines (4KR), which would prevent acetylation but preserve the charge of the lysine, was used as an additional control. As shown in Fig. 5, the wild type and 3KA polypeptides dimerized and tetramerized readily (lanes 2 and 4). In contrast, the 4KA-1, 4KA-2, and 4KA-3 polypeptides completely failed to do so (lanes 6, 8, and 10). Importantly, polypeptides from the 4KR mutant, which is a nuclear protein (data not shown), showed a wild type capacity to oligomerize (lane 12). Together, these results demonstrate that the oligomerization status of p53 can be controlled by the charge conferred by a defined number of lysine residues. In this report, we have provided evidence that acetylation regulates p53 subcellular localization, at least in part, by activating its nuclear export. Our study identified the charge of C-terminal lysine residues targeted by p300 as a regulatory element that controls p53 oligomerization and subcellular localization. Our data suggested that acetylation regulates p53 nucleus-cytoplasm trafficking by neutralizing the lysine charge patch, which in turn controls oligomerization-dependent p53 nuclear export. The subcellular localization of p53 is believed to be controlled at the levels of its oligomerization status. It was proposed that tetramerization prevents both p53 nuclear import and p53 nuclear export (reviewed in Ref. 18Liang S.H. Clarke M.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2779-2783Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In the case of nuclear export, as the dominant C-terminal NES is located in the oligomerization domain, it was suggested that the accessibility of the p53 NES is regulated by the oligomerization status (8Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). This conclusion is supported by the solution and the crystal structure of the oligomerization domain, which demonstrates that the C-terminal NES is exposed in monomeric or dimeric conformations but that it is buried in p53 tetramers (19Lee W. Harvey T.S. Yin Y. Yau P. Litchfield D. Arrowsmith C.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 877-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 20Clore G.M. Ernst J. Clubb R. Omichinski J.G. Kennedy W.M. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 21Jeffrey P.D. Gorina S. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1995; 267: 1498-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The interconversion between the tetrameric and monomeric states, which corresponds to p53 transcriptional activity, would therefore determine the availability of the NES and, consequently, the efficiency of p53 export. However, the biochemical basis that controls p53 oligomerization and its regulation is poorly understood. In this report, we have provided experimental evidence that the charge of lysine residues targeted by acetylation and ubiquitination machinery may be a key determinant of p53 oligomerization. This conclusion is supported by the observation that mutations that neutralize four acetylatable lysine residues result in p53 that cannot oligomerize (Fig. 5). Further, these charge-neutralizing mutations also lead to p53 accumulation in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4). Lastly, these cytoplasmic accumulations of p53 can be effectively reversed by the nuclear export inhibitor LMB (Figs. 1 and 4). Our data, however, did not exclude the possibility that the charge neutralization of lysine residues might also affect p53 nuclear import as well. Regardless of which mechanism might play a more dominant role, our results supported the idea that a charge modification of the lysine residues is a critical determinant in regulating p53 subcellular localization. If C-terminal charge plays a critical role in p53 nuclear export, how is this charge patch regulated? Our study identified acetylation as one potential mechanism that regulates the lysine charge patch. Acetylation occurs at the ϵ-amino group of a lysine. Thus, acetylation would result in a loss of the positive charge, which in turn would affect p53 oligomerization (Fig. 5) and nucleus-cytoplasm trafficking (Fig. 4). The idea that acetylation regulates p53 export by neutralizing charge is supported by an elegant study on histone H2A.Z in which acetylation was shown to function by modifying a charge patch also made of multiple lysines (17Ren Q. Gorovsky M.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1329-1335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In this regard, ubiquitin also modifies the ϵ-amino group of a lysine. However, given that a fusion of monoubiquitin to p53 is sufficient to promote p53 nuclear export (22Li M. Brooks C.L. Wu-Baer F. Chen D. Baer R. Gu W. Science. 2003; 302: 1972-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar), acetylation and ubiquitination would likely regulate p53 export through different mechanisms. Interestingly, although the conversion of different combinations of four lysines known to be targets of acetylation to alanines (4KA mutants) promotes cytoplasmic accumulation of p53, the conversion of only three lysines (3KA) has little effect (Fig. 4). In support of this observation, we show that p53 4KA mutants fail to tetramerize, whereas the 3KA mutants do as efficiently as the wild type (Fig. 5). These results suggest that there might be a threshold for the activation of p53 export, as determined by the overall charge provided by the lysine cluster at the C terminus. Thus, the extent of charge neutralization by acetylation could in theory determine the subcellular distribution of the activated p53. We suspect that, upon stresses, p53 would be stabilized in the nucleus when fewer than three lysine residues are acetylated; however when more than four lysine residues are acetylated, presumably in response to prolonged or intense insults, p53 becomes hyperacetylated and exported to the cytoplasm. What is the biological significance of acetylation-mediated p53 nuclear exit? All evidence so far indicates that acetylation positively regulates p53 function (4Brooks C.L. Gu W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Thus, it is logical to speculate that hyperacetylated p53 has a function when it is delivered to the cytoplasmic compartment. Interestingly, recent evidence indicates that p53 can also promote apoptosis by directly interacting with the apoptosis machinery in mitochondria (10Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). Although a recent study observed very similar profiles in the acetylation level on lysine 382 and 372 of nuclear and mitochondrial p53 and thus concluded that acetylation is not the determining factor for mitochondria targeting (23Nemajerova A. Erster S. Moll U.M. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), it remains possible that the total acetylation of mitochondrial p53 might still be up-regulated via other acetylatable lysine residues. Alternatively, the hyperacetylated cytoplasmic p53 might undergo rapid deacetylation before they reach mitochondria. Although the importance of acetylation-mediated p53 nuclear export in tumor suppression still awaits further investigation, our study identified acetylation as a potential mechanism that controls p53 intracellular trafficking in response to stresses.

We have reported previously that splice variant ATF3ΔZip2, which lacks the leucine zipper region, is induced in response to various stress stimuli. However, its biological function has not been elucidated. By using cells treated with tumor necrosis factor-α and actinomycin D or cells overexpressing ATF3ΔZip2, we showed that ATF3ΔZip2 sensitizes cells to apoptotic cell death in response to tumor necrosis factor-α, at least in part through suppressing nuclear factor (NF)-κB-dependent transcription of anti-apoptotic genes such as cIAP2 and XIAP. ATF3ΔZip2 interacts with a p65 (RelA)-cofactor complex containing CBP/p300 and HDAC1 at NF-κB sites of the proximal promoter region of the cIAP2 gene in vivo and down-regulates the recruitment of CBP/p300. Our study revealed that ATF3ΔZip2 counteracts anti-apoptotic activity of NF-κB, at least in part, by displacing positive cofactor CBP/p300 and provides insight into the mechanism by which ATF3 regulates cell fate through alternative splicing in stress response.

Genet. 1998; 32: 279-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). A variety of functionally distinct isoforms is generated from a single gene by use of different combinations of splice junctions, and may play role in coordinating gene regulation in response of cells to various environmental stimuli. However, the altered gene regulatory function and the biological implication of spliced variants still remain elusive.Activating transcription factor (ATF) 3The abbreviations used are: ATFactivating transcription factorTNF-αtumor necrosis factor-αCBPcyclic AMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding proteinHDAChistone deacetylasep/CAFCBP-associated factorChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationGFPgreen fluorescence proteinPBSphosphate-buffered salinePMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideGSTglutathione S-transferaseDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochlorideGFPgreen fluorescent proteinm.o.i.multiplicity of infectionGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseRTreverse transcriptionsiRNAsmall interfering RNANF-κBnuclear factor-κB. 3The abbreviations used are: ATFactivating transcription factorTNF-αtumor necrosis factor-αCBPcyclic AMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding proteinHDAChistone deacetylasep/CAFCBP-associated factorChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationGFPgreen fluorescence proteinPBSphosphate-buffered salinePMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideGSTglutathione S-transferaseDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochlorideGFPgreen fluorescent proteinm.o.i.multiplicity of infectionGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseRTreverse transcriptionsiRNAsmall interfering RNANF-κBnuclear factor-κB. 3 is a member of the ATF/CREB family of basic leucine zipper-type transcription factors. It is induced upon exposure of cells to a variety of physiological and pathological stimuli (2Hai T. Wolfgang C.D. Marsee D.K. Allen A.E. Sivaprasad U. Gene Expr. 1999; 7 (and references therein): 321-335PubMed Google Scholar), and it is thought to have cell-detrimental effects, such as cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (2Hai T. Wolfgang C.D.

Ectopic expression of ATF3 in heart, liver, and pancreatic β-cells causes cardiac enlargement, liver cell dysfunction, and diabetes, respectively (6Okamoto Y. Chaves A. Chen J. Kelley R. Jones K.

On the other hand, ATF3 is also rapidly induced in the regenerating liver (9Hsu J.-C. Laz T. Mohn K.L. Taub R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3511-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) or in cells treated with serum or growth-stimulating factors (10Iyer V.R. Eisen M.B. Ross D.T. Schuler G. Moore T. Lee J.C.F.

It can support cell survival of endothelial cells (11Kawauchi J. Zhang C. Nobori K. Hashimoto Y. Adachi M.T. Noda A. Sunamori M. Kitajima S. J. Biol.

Namikawa K. Kiryu-Seo S. Kiyama H. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5187-5196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown recently that ATF3 is a target of the proto-oncogene c-myc in serum-induced cell proliferation (13Tamura K. Hua B. Adachi S. Guney I. Kawauchi J. Morioka M. Adachi T.M. Tanaka Y. Nakabeppu Y. Sunamori M. Sedivy J.M. Kitajima S. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2590-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, ATF3 may function differently depending on the cellular context.ATF3 is composed of 181 amino acids, and the basic region and leucine zipper domain from 88 to 147 amino acids are required for dimer formation and specific DNA binding (14Chen B.P.C. Liang G. Whelan J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15819-15826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hsu J.-C. Bravo R. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4654-4665Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The homodimer of ATF3 represses transcription from various promoters with ATF sites (14Chen B.P.C. Liang G. Whelan J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15819-15826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hsu J.-C. Bravo R. Taub R. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1992; 12: 4654-4665Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In addition to the heteromeric complexity, various spliced isoforms of ATF3 may further generate functional diversity in different cellular context. ATF3ΔZip has been isolated in serum-stimulated HeLa cells (14Chen B.P.C. Liang G. Whelan J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15819-15826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas ATF3ΔZip2c and ΔZip3 were identified in amino acid-deprived cells (17Pan Y. Chen H. Siu F. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38402-38412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Another isoform, ATF3b, is implicated in mediating cAMP signaling of proglucagon transcription in pancreatic α-cells (18Wang J. Cao Y. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32899-32904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We have isolated previously ATF3ΔZip2a and -b from cells treated with various stimuli such as A23187, TNF-α, endoplasmic reticulum stress, or oxidative stress (19Hashimoto Y. Zhang C. Kawauchi J. Imoto I. Adachi M.T. Inazawa J. Amagasa T. Hai T. Kitajima S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2398-2406Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These two isoforms encode the C-terminally truncated protein of 135 amino acids, which shares the N-terminal 116 amino acids with the full-length ATF3 but contains novel 19 amino acids at the C terminus. ATF3ΔZip2 lacks the leucine zipper domain and thus is capable of DNA binding. It is localized in the nucleus and counteracts the transcriptional regulation by full-length ATF3 in a reporter assay (19Hashimoto Y. Zhang C. Kawauchi J. Imoto I. Adachi M.T. Inazawa J. Amagasa T. Hai T. Kitajima S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2398-2406Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the functional role and biological significance of this spliced isoform in stress response are unknown.Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the expression of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses (20Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5541) Google Scholar, 21Karin M. Ben-Nerish Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4043) Google Scholar). It is located in the cytoplasm of nonstimulated cells as a form bound to IκB, but it is released by degradation of IκBα and enters the nucleus in response to stimuli. There are five known members of the mammalian NF-κB/Rel family: p65 (RelA), c-Rel, RelB, p50, and p52. p65, RelB, and c-Rel are transcriptionally active, whereas p50 and p52 function as the DNA-binding subunits. Recent analysis of NF-κB-deficient mice and cells has further clarified its role in inhibiting apoptosis (22Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immun. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref Scopus (2433) Google Scholar). For instance, RelA-deficient mouse fibroblasts showed increased sensitivity to pro-apoptotic stimuli such as TNF-α, which by itself is a poor inducer of apoptosis unless accompanied by inhibitors of new RNA or protein synthesis (23Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2925) Google Scholar, 24Van Antwerp D.I. Martin S.I. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2440) Google Scholar). NF-κB induces the expression of a number of genes including cIAPs, cFLIP, A1, TRAF1, and TRAF2, whose products can inhibit apoptosis (22Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immun. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref Scopus (2433) Google Scholar, 25Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar). Among them, cIAP2 contains two functional κB sites in the promoter (26Hong S.-Y. Yoon W.-H. Park J.-H. Kang S.-G. Ahn J.-H. Lee T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18022-18028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and the cIAP2 protein directly binds and inhibits effector caspases, such as caspase 3 and 7, as well as prevents activation of pro-caspase 6 and 9 (27Deveraux Q.L. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Van Arsdale T. Zhou Q. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2215-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). Another cIAP, X chromosome-linked IAP (XIAP), also inhibits TNF-induced apoptosis of cells expressing the IκBα super-repressor mutant (28Stehlik C. de Martin R. Kumabashiri I. Schmid J.A. Binder B.R. Lipp J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). NF-κB has also been shown to inhibit apoptosis by DNA-damaging agents, including cancer therapeutics (29Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar, 30Baldwin A.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar).It is well known that NF-κB-dependent transcription requires the recruitment of multiple coactivator proteins. CBP and its homologue p300 interact with the p65 subunit of NF-κB to activate responsive gene promoters (31Gerritsen M.E. Williams A.J. Neish A.S. Moore S. Shi Y. Collins T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2927-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 32Perkins N.D. Felzien L.K. Betts J.C. Leung K. Beach D.H. Nabel G.J. Science. 1997; 275: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), and this interaction is enhanced by inducible phosphorylation of p65 (33Zhong H. May M.J. Jimi E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). The histone acetyltransferase activity of p/CAF is also required for the NF-κB-activated transcription (34Sheppard K.A. Rose D.W. Haque Z.K. Kurokawa R. McInerney E. Westin S. Thanos D. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6367-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas steroid receptor coactivator-1 interacts with the p50 subunit of NF-κB to potentiate the transcription (35Na S.Y. Lee S.K. Han S.J. Choi H.S. Im S.Y. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10831-10834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Inversely, HDAC1/2 (36Ashburner B.P. Westerheide S.D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7065-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar), SNIP1 (37Kim R.H. Flanders K.C. Reffey S.B. Anderson L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46297-46304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and PIAS3 (38Jang H.D. Yoon K. Shin Y.J. Kim J. Lee S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24873-24880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) interact with p65 to negatively regulate gene expression. More recently, the candidate tumor suppressor gene product ING4 has been reported to interact with p65 and suppress the NF-κB-dependent anti-apoptosis (39Garkavtsev I. Kozin S.V. Chernova O. Xu L. Winkler F. Brown E. Barnett G.H. Jain R.K. Nature. 2004; 428: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Thus, the differential binding of p65 with coactivators or repressors determines the extent of activation or repression of NF-κB-dependent gene expression. However, our knowledge is still limited about what molecule(s) modulate NF-κB-dependent transcription in stress response.In this report, we explored the functional role of ATF3ΔZip2 by using TNF-α-stimulated cells. It was demonstrated that ATF3ΔZip2, but not full-length ATF3, sensitizes cells to apoptotic cell death, partly by suppressing the expression of NF-κB-dependent anti-apoptotic genes cIAP2 and XIAP. ATF3ΔZip2 is further shown to bind directly to the p65 subunit of NF-κB and down-regulate the CBP/p300 recruitment. Our study provides evidence that ATF3ΔZip2, which is generated through stress-activated alternative splicing, represses NF-κB activity and may play pro-apoptotic role in stress response.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids, Antibodies, and Reagents—A mammalian expression plasmid pMEFLAGATF3ΔZip2 and a bacterial expression plasmid encoding the GST fusion of ATF3ΔZip2 were as described (19Hashimoto Y. Zhang C. Kawauchi J. Imoto I. Adachi M.T. Inazawa J. Amagasa T. Hai T. Kitajima S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2398-2406Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Mammalian expression vectors for the p65 and p50 subunits of NF-κB were generous gifts from Dr. Fujita at the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute, Tokyo, Japan. Plasmid vector for expressing p65 in Escherichia coli was constructed by subcloning into pET21a (Novagen). Expression plasmids, pCI-cIAP2 and pCI-XIAP, were prepared by subcloning cDNAs encoding human cIAP2 (GenBank™ accession number NM182962) and XIAP (GenBank™ accession number NM001167) into the pCIneo vector (Clontech), respectively. A bacterial expression plasmid pGST-CBP2N encoding a GST fusion of the N-terminal 117-738 amino acids of CBP and a mammalian expression vector pcDNA3/mCBP-HA for mouse CBP (40Nakajima T. Fukamizu A.

Rabbit anti-ATF3 (C-19), anti-ATF2 (N-96), anti-p65, anti-p50, anti-IκBα (FL), anti-cIAP2 (H-85), anti-CBP (C-20), anti-p300 (C-20), goat anti-HDAC1 (C-19), and monoclonal anti-GST (B-14) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 and anti-β-tubulin antibodies were from Sigma. Anti-ATF3 antibody was also generated by immunizing rabbits with full-length ATF3 expressed in E. coli. Recombinant human TNF-α was purchased from Genzyme. Other chemicals were reagent grade.Cell Culture and Transient Expression—TGR-1 is a subclone of the immortalized rat embryonic Rat-1 cell line, and U2OS is a human osteosarcoma cell line, respectively. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. For transient expression, plasmid DNA was vortex-mixed with SuperFect (Qiagen) and transfected into cells according to the manufacturer's instruction.Adenovirus Preparation and Gene Transfer—An adenovirus vector AdATF3 encoding the full-length ATF3 was as described (11Kawauchi J. Zhang C. Nobori K. Hashimoto Y. Adachi M.T. Noda A. Sunamori M. Kitajima S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39025-39034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and a vector AdATF3ΔZip2 for FLAG-tagged ATF3ΔZip2 was constructed as in a protocol of an adenovirus expression vector kit from Takara (Otsu, Japan). Briefly, a blunt-ended cDNA fragment of ATF3ΔZip2 was subcloned into the Swa1 site of the E1-deleted region of a cassette cosmid vector pAxCAwt and was cotransfected into 293 cells with DNA-terminal protein complex (42Miyake S. Makimura M. Kanegae Y. Harada S. Sato Y. Takamori K. Tokuda C. Saito I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Cells expressing recombinant viruses for FLAG-tagged ATF3ΔZip2 were screened by anti-FLAG immunoblot analysis and cloned by a limiting dilution. An adenovirus vector encoding β-galactosidase (AdLacZ) was a generous gift from Dr. Saito of Tokyo University, Japan. These adenoviruses were plaque-purified, and their titers were determined by titration in 293 cells. For adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, cells were exposed to adenoviral vectors at the indicated multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) and were cultured for the specified times.Isolation of U2OS Cells Stably Expressing ATF3ΔZip2 siRNA—An oligonucleotide that targets the C-terminal amino acid regions unique for human ATF3ΔZip2 from 126 to 132, 5′-ACTTGCATGTGGGCTGTTGGC-3′, was subcloned into pMX-puroII-U6 (43Kamura T.

The resulting vector was transfected into Plat E cells, and recombinant retrovirus was generated. U2OS cells stably expressing mouse ecotropic retrovirus receptor were infected with the recombinant retrovirus and were cultured in medium containing 20 μg/ml puromycin for 4 days.Cell Death Assay—TGR1 cells (6 × 104 cells) that were infected with AdATF3ΔZip2, AdATF3, or AdLacZ virus at 25 m.o.i. for 24 h or U2OS cells (1 × 105 cells) were treated with the indicated concentration of TNF-α for 36 h or 10 ng/ml TNF-α and the indicated amount of actinomycin D for 18 h, respectively. Both attached and floating cells were combined and stained with 0.2% trypan blue. Viable cells were counted and expressed as a proportion of total cells as described before (11Kawauchi J. Zhang C. Nobori K. Hashimoto Y. Adachi M.T. Noda A. Sunamori M. Kitajima S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39025-39034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Alternatively, cells (6 × 104 cells) were transfected with indicated the amounts of pMEFLAGATF3ΔZip2, pCMVGFP, and effector plasmids. At 16 h post-transfection, cells were treated with 20 ng/ml TNF-α and incubated for another 36 h. Cells were then examined for GFP expression and nuclear fragmentation by DAPI staining under a fluorescence microscope (Nikon). Cell death was quantitated as a fraction of cells with fragmented nuclei per GFP-positive cells. For detection of DNA ladder formation, both attached and floating cells were collected 36 h after TNF-α treatment. Their chromosomal DNA was extracted using a kit from Wako (Osaka, Japan), separated on a 1.8% agarose gel, and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide.Cell Extract Preparation and Western Blot Analysis—TGR1 or U2OS cells treated as indicated were harvested, washed in PBS, and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin, 200 μm sodium vanadate, 100 mm NaF, and 10% glycerol). After incubation on ice for 10 min, the cells were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatants were taken as whole cell extract. The amounts of protein were measured by the Lowry method using bovine serum albumin as standard (44Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell extracts (20 μg of protein) were separated on an SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and subjected to Western blot using the protocol of ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences).Nuclear Translocation of NF-κB—For nuclear translocation of NF-κB, U2OS cells (1 × 106 cells) were infected with AdATF3ΔZip2 or AdLacZ at 25 m.o.i. for 24 h and then treated with 20 ng/ml TNF-α. At the time points indicated after TNF-α treatment, cells were harvested and suspended in buffer of 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Cytoplasmic fraction was obtained by centrifugation of cells at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The resultant pellet containing nuclei was washed by the above buffer, dissolved in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Western blot analysis.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—U2OS cells (1.5 × 107 cells) were infected with 25 m.o.i. of AdATF3ΔZip2 or AdLacZ for 24 h and then treated with 20 ng/ml TNF-α for 3 h. Nuclear extracts were then prepared according to the method of Dignam et al. (45Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9142) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts (2 μg of protein) were incubated in 20 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm PMSF, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 0.5 mg of poly(dI-dC) and 0.5 ng of radiolabeled DNA probe at room temperature for 30 min. For supershift assays, anti-p65 or anti-p50 antibody (0.1 μg each) was added and incubated for another 30 min. An oligonucleotide DNA probe for consensus NF-κB motif (sc-2505) 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and radiolabeled with 25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) and polynucleotide kinase. Mutant oligonucleotide (sc-2511) used for the competition experiment was also product of Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Binding mixture was applied onto a 5% nondenatured polyacrylamide slab gel in Tris borate-EDTA buffer. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried on a 3MM Whatman paper and visualized by Fuji Bas 2500 image analyzer.RNA Isolation, Microarray Analysis, and Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—TGR1 cells (1.5 × 106 cells) were infected with AdATF3ΔZip2 or AdLacZ at 25 m.o.i. for 24 h and treated with 20 ng/ml TNF-α for 3 h. Total RNA was then isolated by acid-guanidinium method using a kit from Qiagen. After amplification and labeling of cRNA with Cy3 or Cy5, microarray analysis was performed using custom-made in situ synthesized 60-mer oligonucleotide microarrays containing 22,500 features, including controls (Agilent Technologies). Semi-quantitative measurements of mRNAs for cIAP2, XIAP, TRAF2, FLIP, or GAPDH were performed by RT-PCR of 1 μg of total RNA using a kit from Takara as described in Ref. 19Hashimoto Y. Zhang C.

Reaction products were separated on 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide.Luciferase Assay—Reporter plasmid, pLuc-cIAP2, was constructed by subcloning a 0.6-kb fragment of the human cIAP2 gene promoter (GenBank™ accession number AF233684) from -538 to +55 into an XhoI site of pGL3 vector (Promega). NF-κB-dependent reporter, pNFκB-Luc, which contains four tandem copies of the NF-κB consensus motif fused to a TATA-like promoter from the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter, was obtained from Clontech. U2OS cells (5 × 104 cells) were transfected with 0.5 μg of pLuc-cIAP2 or pNFκB-Luc and the indicated amounts of effector plasmids. At 16 h post-transfection, cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml TNF-α for 24 h. Cells were then harvested, and their extracts were assayed for luciferase activity as described (19Hashimoto Y. Zhang C.

Both firefly and seapansy luciferase activities were measured using a dual luciferase reporter assay system according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). pRL-TK (Toyo Ink, Tokyo, Japan) containing the seapansy luciferase gene was used as an internal control of transfection and expression.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assays were performed as described (13Tamura K.

U2OS cells (4 × 107 cells) were infected with AdATF3ΔZip2 at 25 m.o.i. for 24 h and treated with 20 ng/ml TNF-α. At 8 h post-stimulation, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. After washing twice with PBS, the cells were collected and lysed with 2 ml of SDS lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and sonicated to DNA lengths of ∼250 bp. After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, supernatants were diluted 10-fold in ChIP dilution buffer (16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl, 0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA). Immunoprecipitations were then performed with the indicated antibodies. ChIP DNA was detected using standard PCR with the following primer pairs for the different regions of the cIAP2 gene promoter: the proximal promoter region at -260 to +55 5′-GTAAATGCCGCGAAGATATGCCAC-3′ and 5′-GCATGCACCAGCAAGGACAAG-3′ and the distal promoter region at -538 to -260 5′-CCTTTCACCTCTTACTTTCTTG-3′ and 5′-GTGGCATATCTTCGCGGCATTTAC-3′.Binding Assay of Zip2 Complex—For in vivo binding, U2OS cells (1 × 107 cells) were infected with AdATF3ΔZip2 at 25 m.o.i. for 24 h and then treated with 20 ng/ml TNF-α for 3 h. Alternatively, U2OS cells stably expressing ATF3ΔZip2 siRNA or control GFP siRNA were treated with 10 ng/ml TNF-α and 0.05 μg/ml actinomycin D for 3 h. Whole cell extracts were prepared and incubated with 0.5 μg each of anti-p65 or anti-FLAG antibody at 4 °C for 3 h, followed by incubation with 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h. The resulting immunocomplex was washed and subjected to Western blot analysis. For in vitro binding, full-length ATF3 and ATF3ΔZip2 were expressed as GST fusion as described (19Hashimoto Y. Zhang C.

FAK phosphorylates the cytoskeletal protein α-actinin at Tyr-12. Here we report that protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP 1B) is an α-actinin phosphatase. PTP 1B-dependent dephosphorylation of α-actinin was seen in COS-7 cells and PTP 1B-null fibroblasts reconstituted with PTP 1B. Furthermore, we show that coexpression of wild-type α-actinin and PTP 1B causes dephosphorylation at Tyr-397 in FAK. No dephosphorylation was observed in cells coexpressing the α-actinin phosphorylation mutant Y12F and PTP 1B. Furthermore, the phosphorylation at four other sites in FAK was not altered by PTP 1B. In addition, we found that phosphorylated α-actinin bound to Src and reduced the binding of FAK to Src. The dephosphorylation at Tyr-397 in FAK triggered by wild-type α-actinin and PTP 1B caused a significant increase in cell migration. We propose that phosphorylated α-actinin disrupts the FAK·Src complex exposing Tyr-397 in FAK to PTP 1B.

Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). These fibroblasts form numerous and enlarged focal adhesions and are impaired in cell adhesion and spreading on fibronectin, demonstrating that, although FAK might be involved in adhesions formation, its primary function is adhesion disassembly (21Ilic D.

FAK knockdown fibroblasts, generated by utilizing either FAK small interference RNA or Cre-Lox-mediated excision, formed multiple extensions instead of a single, leading lamellipodium further indicating that FAK plays a role in the spatial organization of the leading edge of migrating cells (22Tilghman R.W.

Cells derived from mice triple deficient in the Src kinases, Src, Yes, and Fyn (SYF-/-), paxillin, or p130CAS, are similarly migration-defective (23Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A.

A quantitative analysis of adhesion site dynamics at the cell front confirmed that the rate of adhesions turnover is significantly reduced in cells lacking FAK, SYF, paxillin, or p130CAS (27Webb D.J.

Whereas tyrosine phosphorylation drives the assembly of focal complexes, the dispersal of these complexes requires dephosphorylation. Src family kinases, FAK, and/or p130CAS are dephosphorylated by a number of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), including SHP-2, PTP-PEST, PTP α, and the low molecular weight phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase (LMW-PTP) (28Yu D.H.

Furthermore, fibroblasts null for either one of these PTPs, or that express dominant-negative forms of these phosphatases, exhibit reduced or excessive adhesions and impaired migration, indicating that the PTPs that act on the FAK·Src signaling complex, and/or pathway, play a pivotal role relative to integrin-mediated cell migration. Surprisingly, little is known about how the disassembly of the FAK·Src complex is regulated or how the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is balanced at adhesion sites. α-Actinin is a ubiquitously expressed protein best known for its actin filaments cross-linking activity (33Burridge K. Feramisco J.R. Nature. 1981; 294: 565-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In addition, α-actinin is localized to, and interacts with, a number of focal adhesion components, including integrins and vinculin (34Wachsstock D.J. Wilkins J.A. Lin S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Whether α-actinin is an early or relatively latecomer into focal adhesions may depend on the integrin type examined (7Zaidel-Bar R. Ballestrem C. Kam Z. Geiger B. J.

In α5-green fluorescent protein-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells plated onto fibronectin, the paxillin-containing adhesions that were devoid of α-actinin turned over significantly faster than the α-actinin-containing adhesions, suggesting that α-actinin contributes to the stabilization or “maturation” of these sites (40Laukaitis C.M.

The phosphorylation of α-actinin reduces its affinity for actin and prevents its localization to focal adhesion plaques (41Izaguirre G. Aguirre L. Hu Y.P. Lee H.Y. Schlaepfer D.D. Aneskievich B.J.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5023-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an increase in the level of α-actinin Tyr-12 phosphorylation, caused by an hyperactivate FAK, or the disruption of a green fluorescent protein-tagged recombinant α-actinin by laser ablation, weakens the strength of linkages formed between integrins and the cytoskeleton and alters the focal adhesion dynamics (42von Wichert G.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 286-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These observations support the possibility that the phosphorylation of α-actinin may serve to modulate the coupling/uncoupling of integrins to the cytoskeleton. Recently we found that α-actinin is dephosphorylated by the hematopoietic PTP SHP-1 (44Lin S.Y. Raval S. Zhang Z. Deverill M. Siminovitch K.A. Branch D.R. Haimovich B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25755-25764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Here we show that α-actinin is also dephosphorylated by the ubiquitously expressed phosphatase, PTP 1B. Unexpectedly, we found that coexpression of PTP 1B with wild-type α-actinin in either COS-7 cells or in PTP 1B-null fibroblasts triggered dephosphorylation of FAK at Tyr-397, the primary Src binding site. The sequence that surrounds the site of phosphorylation in α-actinin, Tyr-12, is similar to the one surrounding Tyr-397 in FAK. This raises the exciting possibility that phosphorylated α-actinin may function as a “FAK decoy” and, as such, may regulate the interaction between FAK and Src (41Izaguirre G. Aguirre L. Hu Y.P. Lee H.Y. Schlaepfer D.D. Aneskievich B.J. Haimovich B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28676-28685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The results presented support this possibility and establish that phosphorylated α-actinin binds Src and reduces the binding of Src to FAK. We propose that the disruption of the FAK·Src complex enables the dephosphorylation of FAK at Tyr-397 by PTP 1B. Furthermore, we show that the dephosphorylation of Tyr-397 in FAK triggered by PTP 1B and wild-type α-actinin caused a significant increase in the rate of cell migration. These data establish a novel role for α-actinin in regulating FAK·Src interaction and suggest the existence of an α-actinin-dependent feedback loop that regulates cell migration.

Bound proteins were eluted in 10-ml fractions with a linear gradient of 0 to 400 mm KCl prepared in buffer C. Fractions eluted with 180–300 mm KCl contained the phosphatase activity. These fractions were combined and concentrated dialyzed as described above. The resulting sample was loaded onto a 5-ml heparin column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 20 ml of buffer C, and bound proteins were eluted in 5-ml fractions with a linear gradient of 0 to 400 mm KCl prepared in buffer C. The active fractions (270–300 mm KCl) were collected and then were resolved by Sephacryl S200 HR column (Amersham Biosciences) with buffer A. The fractions were assayed for phosphatase activity as described below. The final active fraction was analyzed by in gel-phosphatase assay and silver staining exactly as described (44Lin S.Y.

Phosphatase Assay—Phosphorylated recombinant α-actinin was isolated from transfected COS-7 cells as previously described (41Izaguirre G. Aguirre L. Hu Y.P. Lee H.Y. Schlaepfer D.D. Aneskievich B.J. Haimovich B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28676-28685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The purified protein (1 μg) was mixed with phosphatase assay buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 01% β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm PMSF in a final volume of 35 μl. The reaction mix was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The phosphorylation of α-actinin was analyzed by Western blotting with the antibody to phosphotyrosine (pTyr), 4G10. Protein Identification by Tandem Mass Spectrometry—A fraction representing the pooled sample eluted off the Sephacryl S200 HR column was resolved by gel electrophoresis. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. A gel slice containing the region immediately above the 37-kDa marker was sliced out and submitted to analysis at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility. The protein was digested and analyzed by microcapillary reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry on Finnigan LCQ DECA XP quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. Transfection and Expression of Recombinant Proteins in COS-7 and PTP 1B Null Cells—COS-7 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine Plus reagents (Invitrogen) as described (41Izaguirre G. Aguirre L.

Where indicated, cells were transfected with 2 μg of either wild-type- or Y12F-α-actinin cDNAs plus 1 μg of each of the remaining cDNA to a total of 4 μg of cDNA per 10-cm dish. When necessary, an empty vector was used to bring the total cDNA amount to 4 μg. Vanadate (0.5 mm) prepared as described (41Izaguirre G. Aguirre L. Hu Y.P. Lee H.Y. Schlaepfer D.D. Aneskievich B.J.

Unless otherwise indicated, the cells were cultured in the presence of vanadate for 24 h prior to analysis. In experiments in which the cells were not treated with vanadate, the cells were detached with trypsin and replated onto fibronectin-coated dishes (10 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h prior to lysis. The PTP-1B-null cells were transfected as described. In some experiments the cDNAs mix (total of 4 μg per 10-cm dish) contained 0.1 μg of cDNA encoding for the puromycin-resistant gene (pPUR, BD Biosciences Clontech). The cells were treated with puromycin at a concentration of 2 μg/ml starting at 24 h post-transfection. The puromycin-resistant cultures were propagated and expanded for ∼2 weeks. Irrespective of whether the cells were selected with puromycin or not, on the day of the experiment the cells were detached with trypsin and replated onto a fibronectin-coated surface for 1 h as described above. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing vanadate and lysed in modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm PMSF). The lysates were passed several times through a 27-gauge one-half needle to disrupt the cells and to shear the DNA. The samples were normalized for protein content (1 mg/ml) and preabsorbed for 1 h with 30 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The lysates (0.5–1 mg of protein per sample) were then incubated for 2 h with the specified antibodies. Antibody·antigen complexes were precipitated with 30 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads, washed three times with lysis buffer, and eluted with Laemmli sample buffer. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were probed with primary antibodies. Secondary antibody was either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or rabbit anti-mouse (Bio-Rad). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence using ECL reagents kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Pull-down Assay—Two biotin-tagged 20-mer peptides designed based on the N-terminal end of human α-actinin (biotin-DHYDSQQTNDYMQPEEDWDR) were synthesized at the W.C. Keck Biotechnology Resource Center (New Haven, CT). One of the peptides (phosphopeptide) contained a phosphotyrosine residue at position 12. Stock solutions (1 mm) were prepared in buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The peptides (10 μl) were immobilized onto 90 μl of streptavidin-conjugated agarose beads (Pierce). The volume was brought up to 200 μl with phosphate-buffered saline. Immobilized peptides were incubated with lysates from COS-7 cells transfected with c-Src cDNA (500 μg in 1 ml) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% CHAPS, and 1 mm PMSF, prior to elution and analysis by Western blotting and silver staining. Motility Assay—Cell migration was determined using the protocol described by Yu et al. (28Yu D.H. Qu C.K. Henegariu O. Lu X. Feng G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21125-21131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Cells were trypsinized and washed once with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich) and then twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium only. Cells (1 × 105 cells/well) were added to the upper chambers of Transwells containing poly-carbonate membranes (tissue culture-treated, 6.5-mm diameter, 8-μm pores, Costar, Cambridge, MA) precoated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at 37 °C. The lower chamber was filled with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4 μg/ml fibronectin. After incubation for 16 h at 37 °C, the membrane was fixed in methanol, and cells on the upper surface were mechanically removed. The 16-h time point was chosen because in preliminary experiments we found that the total number of cells that migrated at earlier time points was extremely small. Migrated cells on the lower side of membranes were stained using the Diff-Quik (Dade International, Miami, FL) and enumerated under the microscope at ×200 magnification. Five random microscopic fields were counted per well, and all experiments were performed at least three times in duplicates. PTP 1B Is an α-Actinin Phosphatase—Recently, we reported that the protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) SHP-1 is an α-actinin phosphatase (44Lin S.Y. Raval S. Zhang Z. Deverill M. Siminovitch K.A. Branch D.R. Haimovich B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25755-25764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, because the expression of SHP-1 is confined to cells of a hematopoietic origin, we reasoned that α-actinin must be dephosphorylated by an additional PTP that is more ubiquitously expressed. In the course of the purification of SHP-1 from unstimulated platelet lysates, we observed a second phosphatase activity against α-actinin in lysates of thrombin-stimulated platelets. The phosphatase was purified using a previously described approach (44Lin S.Y. Raval S. Zhang Z. Deverill M. Siminovitch K.A. Branch D.R. Haimovich B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25755-25764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The phosphatase activity against α-actinin was partially purified using four sequential chromatography steps that included a reactive Green 19 resin, an ion exchange Hitrap Q column, a Heparin column, and a Sephacryl S200 HR seizing column. Fractions containing activity of one or more phosphatases against α-actinin were identified after each column and pooled. A single activity peak was recovered at each step. The peak eluted off the Heparin column was analyzed using an in-gel phosphatase assay (Fig. 1A) and was found to contain a single phosphatase activity band of ∼45 kDa. The protein was identified as PTP 1B by tandem mass spectrometry. Purified PTP 1B dephosphorylated α-actinin in vitro (Fig. 1B), but because PTP 1B can dephosphorylate a number of phosphoproteins in vitro, the specificity of PTP 1B toward α-actinin had to be confirmed in vivo. Because platelets are not amenable to genetic manipulation, we used two different cell systems to ask whether PTP 1B is an α-actinin phosphatase. Although the phosphorylation of α-actinin is difficult to detect in many cell types, robust phosphorylation of α-actinin was observed in vanadate-treated COS-7 cells (Fig. 2A) (41Izaguirre G.

Vanadate is a reversible inhibitor of PTPs and as such it reduces, but does not completely inhibit, the activity of PTPs (47Huyer G. Liu S. Kelly J. Moffat J. Payette P. Kennedy B. Tsaprailis G.

https://openalex.org/W2018232486,"Activation of Wnt/β-catenin target genes is regulated by a heterodimer of β-catenin and the high mobility group box transcription factors of the lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF)/T-cell factor (TCF) family. In vertebrates, four LEF/TCF family members have been identified. They all contain a conserved β-catenin-binding motif at the N terminus and a highly conserved high mobility group box for DNA binding. The core sequence between these motifs is less conserved and contributes to the specific properties of the individual family members. To identify interacting proteins that allocate specific functions to the individual LEF/TCF transcription factors, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the less conserved core sequence as bait. We isolated the murine LIM protein HIC-5 (hydrogen peroxide-induced clone 5; also termed ARA-55 (androgen receptor activator of 55 kDa)) and cloned the highly conserved Xenopus homolog. In addition, we report that the LIM domain-containing C-terminal half of HIC-5 binds to a conserved alternatively spliced exon in LEF/TCF transcription factors. Our functional analyses revealed that HIC-5 acts as negative regulator of a subset of LEF/TCF family members, which have been characterized as activators in reporter gene analyses and in the Xenopus axis induction assay. In addition, we observed a repressive interference of LEF/TCF family members with HIC-5-mediated activation of glucocorticoid-driven transcription, which again could be allocated to specific LEF/TCF subtypes. With the characterization of HIC-5 as a binding partner of the alternatively spliced exon in LEF/TCF transcription factors, we identified a novel molecular mechanism in the dialog of steroid and canonical Wnt signaling that is LEF/TCF subtype-dependent.

They all contain a highly conserved β-catenin-binding domain and an even more conserved DNA-binding site, the high mobility group (HMG) box. In general, they are activated by recruiting the coactivator β-catenin, which is thought to replace the repressor Groucho (available at www.stanford.edu/~rnusse/wntwindow.html) (1Logan C.Y. Nusse R.

Thereby, LEF/TCF target genes that are repressed in the absence of Wnt/β-catenin signaling become activated. Apart from a complex regulatory network in the cytoplasm that controls β-catenin stability and binding behavior, modulator proteins in the nucleus further decide the cell competence to respond to canonical Wnt signaling. In addition, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is influenced by cross-talk with other signaling cascades, including transforming growth factor-β/SMAD (3Nishita M. Hashimoto M.K. Ogata S. Laurent M.N. Ueno N.

Although the general view of LEF/TCF action is well understood, the functional specificity of individual LEF/TCF proteins are often ignored. Most of the LEF/TCF-binding proteins mentioned above do not discriminate between the different family members or splice variants. Furthermore, proteins such as CtBP and ALY that bind selectively to individual LEF/TCF proteins cannot completely explain their functional differences. For example, CtBP binds to PLSL(T/V) motifs in the C termini of TCF-3 and TCF-4E, resulting in repression of target genes (8Valenta T. Lukas J. Korinek V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2369-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 9Brannon M. Brown J.D. Bates R. Kimelman D. Moon R.T. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 3159-3170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). But even after depletion of the CtBP-binding site, XTCF-3 still neither activates target genes nor induces a secondary axis in Xenopus embryos (10Gradl D. König A. Wedlich D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14159-14171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that the core region between the β-catenin-binding domain and the HMG box confers specific properties to individual LEF/TCF transcriptions factors (10Gradl D. König A. Wedlich D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14159-14171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This region has formerly been described as the interaction domain for Groucho (11Levanon D. Goldstein R.E. Bernstein Y. Tang H. Goldenberg D. Stifani S. Paroush Z. Groner Y. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.

It contains a highly conserved alternatively spliced exon, which is termed exon IVa in TCF-1, exon VI in LEF-1, and exon VIII in TCF-4. Interestingly, a Xenopus LEF-1 RNA containing this exon has not been reported so far. Two small repressive peptide motifs adjacent to this exon are alternatively expressed in TCF-4 (10Gradl D.

With the exception of this conserved exon, the sequence between the β-catenin-binding domain and the HMG box is less conserved and only poorly characterized. In addition to the modulators of LEF/TCF activity mentioned above, steroid receptors not only bind β-catenin (14Yang F. Li X. Sharma M. Sasaki C.Y. Longo D.L. Lim B. Sun Z. J. Biol.

Steroid receptors belong to the family of ligand-activated zinc finger transcription factors and consist of an N-terminal transactivation domain, two zinc fingers, and a hormone-binding site. Upon ligand binding, the steroid receptor changes its conformation, which reduces the binding affinity of inhibitors (e.g. hsp90). After dimerization, it enters the nucleus and activates target genes. Interestingly, the cross-talk between Wnt/β-catenin signaling and steroid response is bidirectional: glucocorticoids inhibit the transcriptional activity of LEF/TCF proteins, whereas TCF proteins modulate estrogen receptor activity. Depending on individual TCF family members, the latter can result in enhancement (TCF-1) or suppression (TCF-4) of the estrogen-driven promoter response (16Amir A.L. Barua M. McKnight N.C. Cheng S.

Apart from the internal transactivation domain, several adaptor proteins that bind to steroid receptors and activate expression of target genes have been identified. Among them, ARA-55 (androgen receptor activator of 55 kDa; also named HIC-5 (hydrogen peroxide-induced clone 5)) was initially described as a component of the focal adhesion complex, in which it binds to the focal adhesion kinase (19Fujita H.

HIC-5/ARA-5 (referred to below only as HIC-5) belongs to the paxillin family of LIM proteins because it shares common protein-protein interaction motifs with paxillin: HIC-5 possesses three LD domains in the N-terminal half and four LIM domains in the C-terminal half. Recent studies confirmed a nuclear role of HIC-5 as coactivator of steroid receptors (21Yang L. Guerrero J. Hong H. DeFranco D.B. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Biol.

The pleiotropic functions of HIC-5 imply an important role as a regulatory protein, allowing the cell to integrate the input of different signaling cascades. In this study, we identify HIC-5 as a novel binding partner of LEF/TCF proteins. The HIC-5 C terminus containing the LIM domains binds to a conserved exon in LEF/TCF proteins. This interaction of HIC-5 and LEF/TCF proteins is conserved in vertebrates and results in a complex that represses both LEF/TCF target gene activation and HIC-5-induced steroid receptor activation. However, this does not present a general regulatory mechanism of LEF/TCF target gene activation because only those family members that contain the conserved exon and that act as activators (Xenopus (X) TCF-4C, murine (m) LEF-1, human (h) TCF-1, and hTCF-4) are repressed by HIC-5. Other family members that activate target genes but do not contain the exon (e.g. XLEF-1) are not regulated by HIC-5. However, transcription factors that do not activate target gene promoters (TCF-3 and XTCF-4A) are not regulated by HIC-5. Instead, they repress HIC-5-induced steroid receptor activation. Thus, HIC-5 is a novel LEF/TCF binding partner that mediates the TCF subtype-specific cross-talk between Wnt/β-catenin signaling and steroid receptor activation.

Bacterial Expression of LEF/TCF Proteins—Transformed BL21(DE3) bacteria were induced at A600 = 0.7 with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 30 °C. After centrifugation, bacterial pellets were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 6.5 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5) additionally containing 400 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, and protease inhibitors. Aliquots of the cleared lysates were stored in liquid nitrogen. Pull-down Assays—Bacterially expressed GST-tagged HIC-5 protein was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4°C in buffer A (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2·6H2O, 0.75 mm CaCl2·2H2O, 2% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors) and incubated with buffer A lysate from transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) epithelial 293 cells. After binding for 2 h at 4 °C,thesamples were washed three times with buffer A, boiled in SDS sample buffer for 5 min, and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose, probed with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10, and revealed by the chemiluminescence reaction (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Immobilized GST-HIC-5 constructs and in vitro translated 35S-labeled LEF/TCF proteins or immobilized GST-LEF/TCF constructs and in vitro translated 35S-labeled HIC-5 proteins were incubated in buffer A, washed, eluted and separated on a 10% SDS gel. After Coomassie Blue staining, the gel was dried and subjected to PhosphorImager (Raytest) analysis to visualize the bound protein. Injection Experiments—mRNA was synthesized in vitro using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion, Inc.). 500 pg of LEF-1 or HIC-5 mRNA or 70 pg of XWNT-8 mRNA were injected into both ventral blastomeres of Xenopus four-cell stage embryos. Embryos were kept as described previously (29Kühl M. Sheldahl L.C. Malbon C.C. Moon R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12701-12711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) and analyzed for the appearance of secondary axis, dorso-anteriorization, and target gene expression. Transfection and Reporter Gene Assays—HeLa and HEK293 cells were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. HEK293 cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation according to Gorman (30Gorman C. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: a Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1985: 143-190Google Scholar), and HeLa cells were transfected with MATra reagent (IBA GmbH, Göttingen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested. Reporter gene assays were performed as described (26Gradl D. Kühl M. Wedlich D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5576-5587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze the glucocorticoid response, transfected cells were treated with 10 nm dexamethasone. Reverse Transcription-PCR—1 μg of HeLa cell total RNA was reverse-transcribed using MMTV reverse transcriptase (Promega). cDNA corresponding to 20 ng of RNA was amplified for 28 (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) or 34 (p21 and p27) cycles with the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase forward primer (5′-GTGGATATTGTTGCCATCAAT-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CGCTGTTGAAGTCAGAGGAG-3′), the p21 forward primer (5-ATGTCCGTCAGAACCCATG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-TTAGGGCTTCCTCTTGGAGA-3′, or the p27 forward primer (5′-GTCTAACGGGAGCCCTAGCC-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CTAACCCCGTCTGGCTGTCC-3′). 1 μgof Xenopus stage 10.5 total RNA was reverse-transcribed using MMTV reverse transcriptase. cDNA corresponding to 20 ng of RNA was amplified for 26 (histone H4) or 34 (siamois and Xnr-3) cycles with the histone H4 forward primer (5′-CGGGATAACATTCAGGGTATCACT-3′) and reverse primer (5′-ATCCATGGCGGTAACTGTCTTCCT-3), the siamois forward primer (5′-CTCCAGCCACCAGTACCAGAT-3′) and reverse primer (5′-GGGGAGAGTGGAAAGTGGTTG-3′, and the Xnr-3 forward primer (5′-TCCACTTGTGCAGTTCCACAG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-ATCTCTTCATGGTGCCTCAGG-3′). Isolation of Full-length XHIC-5—Using degenerated primers, we amplified a 500-bp fragment of the 5′-region of XHic-5 from stage 18 cDNA. 3Primer sequences are available upon request. To obtain the entire open reading frame of XHic-5, we screened a Xenopus tailbud λ-ZAP cDNA library with this fragment. The open reading frame of XHic-5 (GenBank™ accession number AY971603) was subcloned into the NcoI/XhoI sites of pCS2-Myc. Immunostaining—HeLa cells were fixed with 3% formaldehyde and permeabilized by incubation for 8 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Localization of the anti-HIC-5 (polyclonal; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and anti-TCF-3/4 and anti-LEF-1 (monoclonal; Pierce) primary antibodies was visualized with Cy2-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, respectively. XHIC-5 Discriminates between XTCF-3/4 and XLEF-1—To identify new binding partners, we screened a mouse embryonic day 10 library using the core domain (between the β-catenin-binding site and the HMG box) of Xenopus TCF-3 and TCF-4 as bait. We identified HIC-5 as a candidate protein that binds to both XTCF-3 and XTCF-4 (data not shown). The full-length XHic-5 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AY971603) was isolated by screening a Xenopus tailbud λ-ZAP library. The XHIC-5 protein is 40% identical to its human ortholog. The similarity in the conserved three LD and four LIM domains ranges from 55% (LIM domain 2) to 100% (LD domain 2) (Fig. 1A). The most obvious differences between the Xenopus and mammalian HIC proteins are the absence of a 33-amino acid proline-rich region flanking a highly conserved part and the presence of a 55-amino acid acidic and serine-rich region between LD domains 2 and 3 in the Xenopus protein. To confirm the physical interaction found in the yeast two-hybrid screen, we carried out GST pull-down assays using bacterially expressed GST-LEF/TCF fusion proteins and in vitro translated 35S-labeled XHIC-5. Indeed, we found that XHIC-5 bound to XTCF-3 and XTCF-4, but not to the GST control (Fig. 1B). We further confirmed the physical interaction using transfected Myc-tagged XHIC-5 and bacterially expressed GST-LEF/TCF fusion proteins (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, compared with XTCF-3 and XTCF-4, the binding of XHIC-5 to XLEF-1 was very weak (Fig. 1, B and C). HIC-5 Binds to a Conserved Exon—The most obvious difference between XLEF-1 and XTCF-3/4 is a conserved exon that fails in XLEF-1. This exon corresponds to exon IVa in hTCF-1, exon VI in hLEF-1, and exon VIII in hTCF-4, all of which are known to be alternatively spliced. Alternative splicing of this exon has not been reported for the Xenopus homolog of LEF-1; instead, this exon is missing in all XLef-1 cDNAs reported so far (10Gradl D. König A. Wedlich D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14159-14171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 31Molenaar M. van de Wetering M. Oosterwegel M. Peterson-Maduro J. Godsave S. Korinek V. Roose J. Destree O. Clevers H. Cell. 1996; 86: 391-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar). By constructing chimeric proteins, we have recently shown that this exon promotes target gene activation (10Gradl D. König A. Wedlich D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14159-14171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To confirm that this conserved exon is the HIC-5-binding domain, we transfected Myc-tagged Xenopus LEF/TCF constructs and analyzed their binding to recombinantly expressed HIC-5 in GST pull-down assays. Indeed, wild-type XLEF-1 hardly bound HIC-5, whereas a chimeric XLEF-1 construct containing the conserved exon of XTCF-3 (XLEF-1+Exon) was precipitated with immobilized GST-HIC-5 (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, in vitro translated HIC-5 bound to the recombinantly expressed exon of XTCF-3 and XTCF-4 (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, HIC-5 did not discriminate among XTCF-4A, -4B, and -4C, which differ in the presence of two small peptide motifs flanking the conserved exon (Fig. 2B). The C Terminus (but Not the N Terminus) of HIC-5 Binds to LEF/TCF Proteins—We next tried to map the binding domain in HIC-5. As HIC-5 contains two putative protein-protein interaction sites, the LD and LIM domains, we fused the LD domain- and LIM domain-containing parts separately to GST. Therefore, we cut the protein into two halves, the N-terminal half containing the three LD domains and the C-terminal half containing the four LIM domains (Fig. 3). GST pull-down assays with in vitro translated LEF/TCF proteins revealed that the LEF/TCF-binding site is the LIM domain-containing C terminus, but not the LD domains (Fig. 3). Thus, the conserved exon of LEF/TCF proteins interacts with the C terminus, most likely with the LIM domains, of HIC-5. Because the binding of HIC-5 to LEF/TCF proteins was observed for the Xenopus and murine proteins and also between the corresponding binding partners of different species, we conclude that the interaction is conserved in vertebrates. HIC-5 Suppresses LEF/TCF-induced Target Gene Activation—Next, we asked whether the physical interaction between LEF/TCF proteins and HIC-5 results in activation or repression of Wnt/β-catenin target genes. Therefore, we cotransfected HEK293 cells with LEF/TCF reporter constructs, HIC-5, and different LEF/TCF expression constructs. Transfected HIC-5 (both the murine and Xenopus orthologs) had only a minor effect on the activity of the TOPFlash promoter by itself. Consistent with previously published data (10Gradl D. König A. Wedlich D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14159-14171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 13Pukrop T. Gradl D. Henningfeld K. Knöchel W. Wedlich D. Kühl M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8968-8978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), XTCF-4C and XLEF-1 (but not XTCF-4A and XTCF-3) activated the TOPFlash promoter in HEK293 cells (Fig. 4A). In the presence of HIC-5, however, XTCF-4C did not activate the TOPFlash promoter, and activation by the chimeric XLEF-1+Exon construct was drastically reduced. In the case of XTCF-4C, promoter activation dropped from 2.1 to 1.2-fold (mHIC-5) or 0.8-fold (XHIC-5) and, in the case of XLEF-1+Exon, from 4.1- to 1.9- or 1.5-fold, respectively (Fig. 4A). Consistent with the observation that HIC-5 bound to a conserved exon present in XTCF-3, XTCF-4, and XLEF-1+Exon but missing in XLEF-1, we found no effect of HIC-5 on TOPFlash activation via XLEF-1. The promoter was activated by 1.5–2-fold irrespective of whether HIC-5 was cotransfected or not (Fig. 4A). The specificity of TOPFlash activation and repression is documented by cotransfection of the control promoter FOPFlash, which was neither activated by XLEF-1+Exon nor repressed by HIC-5 (Fig. 4B). This repressive function of HIC-5 is conserved among vertebrates because the results were similar and even more pronounced when we studied mHIC-5 in combination with human or murine LEF/TCF proteins. mLEF-1, hTCF-1, and h-TCF-4 activated the TOPFlash promoter by 3.1–3.5-fold. As shown for the Xenopus LEF/TCF proteins, cotransfection of HIC-5 inhibited mammalian LEF/TCF-induced promoter activation (Fig. 4C). Although TCF-3 contains the conserved exon, it did not activate the TOPFlash promoter and was not regulated by HIC-5. The regulation of Wnt target genes by HIC-5 is not restricted to the artificial TOPFlash promoter. We observed a similar response when we used the Xenopus fibronectin promoter (Fig. 4D). Again, cotransfection of HIC-5 prevented promoter activation by XLEF-1+Exon (1.7-fold versus 3.2-fold) and XTCF-4C (1.6-fold versus 2.3-fold), but not by XLEF-1. Thus, the binding of the conserved exon of LEF/TCF proteins to the C-terminal half of HIC-5 is conserved among vertebrates and prevents activation of Wnt/β-catenin target gene promoters. HIC-5 Suppresses Secondary Axis Formation—Ectopic activation of the Wnt/β-catenin cascade in the ventral hemisphere of Xenopus embryos results in the induction of a secondary Spemann organizer and subsequently in the appearance of a secondary body axis. The only LEF/TCF family member that mimics an activated Wnt/β-catenin cascade and induces a secondary body axis upon ventral injection is LEF-1. We showed recently that the frequency of secondary axis formation is higher following mLEF-1 injection than following XLEF-1 injection and that this difference is due to the presence of the conserved exon (10Gradl D. König A. Wedlich D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14159-14171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). If HIC-5 is indeed a general repressor that binds to the conserved exon, it should suppress mLEF-1 (but not XLEF-1)-induced secondary axis formation in Xenopus embryos. Therefore, we co-injected 500 pg of HIC-5 mRNA together with 500 pg of mLEF-1 or XLEF mRNA into both ventral blastomeres of Xenopus four-cell stage embryos and scored the appearance of a secondary axis. As expected, co-injected HIC-5 reduced the frequency of secondary axis formation induced by mLEF-1 from 33 to 15%, but had no effect on the frequency of XLEF-1-induced secondary axis formation (Fig. 5, A and B). After injection of 70 pg of XWNT-8 mRNA, most of the embryos (94%, n = 80) showed the most severe canonical Wnt phenotype, a complete dorso-anteriorization. This phenotype is best seen by a ring-shaped cement gland (Fig. 5C). After co-injection of HIC-5, only 3% (n = 104) of the injected embryos showed this complete dorso-anteriorization. Instead, 58% of th"

The main mechanism responsible for the generation of recombinant viruses is a process of copy choice between the two copies of genomic RNA during reverse transcription. We previously identified, after a single cycle of infection of cells in culture, a recombination hot spot within the gp120 gene, corresponding to the top portion of a RNA hairpin. Here, we determine that the hot region is circumscribed to 18 nucleotides located in the descending strand of the stem, following the sense of reverse transcription. Three factors appeared to be important, albeit at different extents, for the high rate of recombination observed in this region. The position of the hot sequence in the context of the RNA structure appears crucial, because changing its location within this structure triggered differences in recombination up to 20-fold. Another pivotal factor is the presence of a perfectly identical sequence between donor and acceptor RNA in the region of transfer, because single or double nucleotide differences in the hot spot were sufficient to almost completely abolish recombination in the region. Last, the primary structure of the hot region also influenced recombination, although with effects only in the 2-3-fold range. Altogether, these results provide the first molecular dissection of a hot spot in infected cells and indicate that several factors contribute to the generation of a site of preferential copy choice.

The genome of retroviruses consists of a single-stranded RNA molecule of positive polarity, present in two copies within retroviral particles in the form of a dimer (1Vogt V.M. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 27-69Google Scholar). After infection of a target cell, reverse transcription will generate a double-stranded DNA molecule that will be integrated into the genome of the host. A process that has been shown to be extremely frequent in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) 3The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; RT, reverse transcriptase; RTP, reverse transcription products; nt, nucleotides; NC, nucleocapsid protein. is template switching between the two copies of genomic RNA during the reverse transcription step (2Galetto R. Negroni M. AIDS Rev. 2005; 7: 92-102PubMed Google Scholar). According to recent estimates, from 3 to 30 switching events can occur per genome for each infectious cycle, depending on the type of infected cell (3Jetzt A.E. Yu H. Klarmann G.J. Ron Y.

When the two genomic RNAs are not identical (heterozygous viruses), this process can generate chimeric DNA molecules that will result in the production of recombinant viruses in the subsequent generation. In HIV-1, the high genetic heterogeneity and the frequent occurrence of coinfection of a cell by genetically divergent viruses (5Jost S. Bernard M.C. Kaiser L. Yerly S. Hirschel B. Samri A. Autran B.

As a consequence, recombination is extremely frequent in this virus and is considered nowadays as the main source of HIV-1 genetic variability worldwide (9Rambaut A. Posada D. Crandall K.A. Holmes E.C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2004; 5: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying recombination in HIV-1 have been intensively studied during the last decade. Most recombination events have been shown to occur by template switching during synthesis of the first DNA strand, when the reverse transcriptase (RT) uses the genomic RNA as a template (3Jetzt A.E.

In retroviruses, reverse transcription is coupled to the degradation of the RNA template by the RT-encoded RNase H activity, a process that is mandatory for template switching (13DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Rodriguez-Rodriguez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6370-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Telesnitsky A. Goff S.P. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses.

A. 1995; 92: 6971-6975Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The degradation of the template RNA (donor RNA) is required to leave the trailing nascent DNA in a single-stranded form, available for annealing onto the other copy of genomic RNA present within the viral particle (acceptor RNA). This interaction would then drive the ultimate transfer of the growing 3′ end of the nascent DNA onto the second RNA moiety, leading to the generation of a chimeric DNA carrying genetic information from both copies of genomic RNA. Different causes have been proposed to be responsible for template switching (16Negroni M. Buc H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 275-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), such as breaks on the genomic RNA (17Coffin J.M. J. Gen.

In some of these cases the hairpin structures were suggested to induce stalling of reverse transcription at their base favoring the annealing of the acceptor RNA on the nascent DNA (20Roda R.H.

Using an original system to study recombination after a single cycle of infection of cells in culture, we recently identified a hot spot within the coding portion of the gp120 gene from the LAI strain of HIV-1, where the recombination rate per nucleotide was up to 10 times higher than those observed in the surrounding regions (34Galetto R.

In that work, which provided the first demonstration of the existence of a hot spot for recombination in infected cells, copy choice was studied on a 400-nt long region that was subdivided into five subregions named R1 to R5 following the sense of (-)-DNA synthesis. The hot region corresponded to region R2, which spanned the 58 nt that make the upper part of a hairpin (C2 hairpin), whose structure was deduced by enzymatic probing in vitro (27Moumen A. Polomack L. Unge T. Veron M. Buc H. Negroni M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15973-15982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition, by introducing mutations in the lower part of the stem in such a way as to alter the stability of the hairpin, we were able to affect the efficiency of recombination in R2. In this study, we have addressed the question of which determinants, within R2 itself, are responsible for the high degree of transfer observed.

Chem. 2004; 279: 36625-36632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar. Mutagenesis of the hairpin structure was done using standard molecular biology and cloning techniques. All constructions were verified by sequencing. The transcomplementation plasmids used were pCMVΔR8.2 (35Naldini L. Blomer U. Gallay P. Ory D. Mulligan R. Gage F.H. Verma I.M. Trono D. Science. 1996; 272: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (4016) Google Scholar), coding for HIV-1 gag, pol, and accessory proteins; and pHCMV-G (36Yee J.K. Miyanohara A. LaPorte P. Bouic K. Burns J.C.

For assays with vector particles lacking accessory proteins the pCMVΔR8.74 transcomplementation plasmid was used (37Zufferey R. Nagy D. Mandel R.J. Naldini L. Trono D. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar), together with the pHCMV-G plasmid. Cells—293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin (from Invitrogen), and maintained at 37 °C with 10% CO2. MT4 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Production of Vector Particles—HIV-1-based vectors were produced by transient transfection of 293T cells using the calcium phosphate method as described in Ref. 34Galetto R. Moumen A. Giacomoni V.

Briefly, cells were transfected with an HIV-1 encapsidation plasmid (pCMVΔR8.2) (35Naldini L. Blomer U. Gallay P. Ory D. Mulligan R. Gage F.H. Verma I.M. Trono D. Science. 1996; 272: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (4016) Google Scholar) and a vesicular stomatitis virus envelope expression plasmid (pHCMV-G) (36Yee J.K. Miyanohara A. LaPorte P. Bouic K. Burns J.C. Friedmann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9564-9568Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), together with two plasmids that generate the defective genomic RNAs shown in Fig. 1A. For the generation of viral vectors devoid of accessory proteins, pCMVΔR8.2 was replaced by pCMVΔR8.74 (37Zufferey R. Nagy D. Mandel R.J. Naldini L. Trono D. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar). To eliminate non-internalized DNA from viral preparations, the supernatants from transfected cells were DNase I treated prior to concentration using Vivaspin Ultrafiltration Concentrators (molecular weight cut-off 50,000). The amount of p24 present in vector preparations was determined by using a HIV-1 p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Single Cycle Infection Assays—MT4 cells were transduced with 200 ng of p24 antigen per 106 cells (corresponding to an approximate multiplicity of infection of 20) in a 500-μl volume in 35-mm dishes. Two-hours post-transduction the cells were diluted up to a 4-ml volume with supplemented RPMI medium and maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 40 h. The reverse transcription products (RTP) were purified from the cytoplasmic fraction of transduced cells using the method described by Hirt (38Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (3351) Google Scholar), because most of the RTP remain in an unintegrated form and, additionally, the genomic vectors lack the FLAP sequence shown to enhance nuclear import of RTP (39Zennou V. Petit C. Guetard D. Nerhbass U. Montagnier L. Charneau P. Cell. 2000; 101: 173-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed, high molecular weight DNA was removed by precipitation, and the lysates were cleared by ultracentrifugation. After phenol chloroform extraction from the supernatant, low molecular weight DNA was ethanol-precipitated and purified using the NucleoSpin® Extract clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel). The purified double-stranded DNA was digested with DpnI to eliminate possible contaminating DNA of bacterial origin prior to PCR amplification (20 cycles) with primers BH and SH, and cloning in Escherichia coli. Plating on isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG/X-gal) containing dishes allowed blue/white screening of recombinant and parental colonies, respectively (34Galetto R. Moumen A. Giacomoni V. Veron M. Charneau P. Negroni M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36625-36632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To determine the regions where strand transfer occurred, 48 recombinant clones were analyzed for each triplicate assay. A full panel of controls run in parallel to ascertain that the recombinant molecules were generated during reverse transcription has been previously described (34Galetto R. Moumen A. Giacomoni V. Veron M. Charneau P. Negroni M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36625-36632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Estimation of the Recombination Rates—The transfection of equal amounts of pLac+ and pLac- plasmids leads to the production of similar quantities of each of the genomic RNAs as previously reported (34Galetto R. Moumen A. Giacomoni V. Veron M. Charneau P. Negroni M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36625-36632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), because the same promoter sequence is present in both genomic plasmids. Given that the RNAs also share the same sequences for dimerization and encapsidation, these processes are expected to yield 50% of heterozygous, and 50% of homozygous particles, with an equal amount of lac +/+ and lac-/- vectors, as usually assumed (40An W. Telesnitsky A. AIDS Rev. 2002; 4: 195-212PubMed Google Scholar). After transduction of MT4 cells, the RTP are amplified by PCR and cloned in E. coli after digestion with BamHI and SacII. This procedure will allow cloning BamHI+/lac- and BamHI+/lac+ RTP, which can be generated by reverse transcription in homozygous lac-/- and in heterozygous particles (34Galetto R. Moumen A. Giacomoni V. Veron M. Charneau P. Negroni M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36625-36632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As a result, assuming that only one molecule of double-stranded DNA is generated from each viral particle, one-third of the total amount of colonies will correspond to RTP issued from lac-/- vectors. The total number of colonies is therefore multiplied by 2/3 to consider only the RTP issued from heterozygous particles. The possibility of cloning products of cellular origin was also ruled out as described in Ref. 34Galetto R. Moumen A. Giacomoni V. Veron M. Charneau P. Negroni M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36625-36632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar. The number of white colonies (N) is corrected by a factor given by n/48, where n is the number of colonies that resulted from cloning of RTP after analysis of 48 white colonies. The global frequency of recombination (F) is given by: F = b/{2/3[N(n/48) + b]}, where b is the number of blue colonies. The recombination rate per nucleotide (f) within a given interval (i) is given by: f = F(xi/X)/zi, where F is as above, xi is the number of colonies analyzed where recombination was identified to have occurred within the interval considered, X is the total number of colonies on which mapping was performed, and zi is the size in nucleotides of the interval. Primer Extension Assays—Reverse transcription was primed using a 5′-terminal-labeled deoxyoligonucleotide and, for each RNA analyzed, 3 pmol were annealed with the primer at a molar ratio of primer to RNA of 10:1. Annealing was performed at 65 °C for 5 min in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) and 75 mm KCl, followed by slow cooling to 40 °C. After incubation on ice for 2 min, dithiothreitol was added at a final concentration of 1 mm, together with 100 units of RNasin (Promega). The nucleocapsid protein (NC) was then added at a ratio of 1 molecule of NC for 8 nt of total RNA and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. HIV-1 RT was added at a final concentration of 400 nm and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C to allow the formation of the reverse transcription complex. The reaction was started by addition of the four dNTPs (1 mm each, final concentration) and MgCl2 (at a final concentration of 7 mm), and stopped at various time intervals by addition of EDTA and SDS at a final concentration of 25 mm and 0.4%, respectively. The samples were incubated for 1 h at 56°C and ethanol precipitated after phenol and chloroform extraction. The products were analyzed by autoradiography using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) after electrophoresis on 8% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels containing 8 m urea, using a loading buffer with formamide at a final concentration of 22.5%. Outline of the System for the Study of Recombination—Recombination was studied after a single cycle of infection using the procedure previously described (34Galetto R. Moumen A. Giacomoni V. Veron M. Charneau P. Negroni M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36625-36632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, the system is based in the production of vesicular stomatitis virus envelope-pseudotyped HIV-1 particles by transient transfection of 293T cells with two transcomplementation and two genomic plasmids. The first two plasmids will allow the expression of all HIV-1 proteins except those encoded by the env gene in one case, and of the G protein from the vesicular stomatitis virus envelope in the other. The two genomic plasmids will, instead, direct the synthesis of two defective genomic RNAs that will be encapsidated in the viral particles, and that share a region of homology on which recombination is studied. The viral particles are collected and used to transduce MT4 cells in culture. The rationale is to study copy choice occurring in the region of homology in heterozygous virions by following the generation of BamHI+/lac+ RTP, as indicated in Fig. 1B. This is achieved by screening for the presence of a functional lacZ gene in E. coli after cloning these RTP, as detailed in the legend of Fig. 1. This will provide a snapshot of the products generated after a single infectious cycle in MT4 cells because, as they carry non-functional LTR sequences (Fig. 1B), they will not support transcription of new genomic RNAs. The proportion of lac+ bacterial clones over the total amount of colonies leads to an estimate of the frequency of recombination as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” The presence of specific mutations on the donor or on the acceptor RNA along the region of homology allows it to divide into subregions (Fig. 1C) and, after sequencing recombinant RTP, to assess a recombination rate per nucleotide for each subregion as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Mapping the Hot Region in the Top Portion of the C2 Hairpin—Understanding whether the whole upper half of the hairpin, or if only a portion of this region, is a preferential site for recombination constitutes a crucial issue for dissecting the mechanism of copy choice ongoing in this sequence. To this end, we have introduced, in a first instance, additional mutations in R2 that allow distinguishing between recombination occurring in the upper part of the mounting stem (R2a), in the apical loop (R2b), or in the upper part of the descending stem (R2c) (Fig. 2A). In addition, a mutation introduced in R1 allowed it to split into two regions, one including the lower part of the mounting portion of the stem and the 20 nt that precede it (R1b), and the other region that constitutes the very beginning of the region of homology (R1a, Fig. 1C). The reason for subdividing R1 in two parts was to explore the possibility that the presence of the hairpin enhanced template switching by inducing stalling of the reverse transcription at its base. If this were the case, R1b should display a high degree of transfer. As shown in Fig. 3A (left panel), the frequency of recombination was quite homogeneous, with an average rate of 2.1 × 10-4 per nt (S.D. 0.6 × 10-4), except for region R2c that stood out with a rate five times higher than the average value (10.5 ± 2.3 × 10-4 per nt). R2c is a 18-nt long segment that constitutes the first part of the descending stem, reverse transcribed after the apical loop (Figs. 1C and 2A). The R1b region did not display a rate higher than the average, indicating that potential stalling at the base of the hairpin during reverse transcription does not result in increased strand transfer. This analysis indicates that the hot region is circumscribed (spanning 18 nt out of 400) and maps in a double-stranded portion of the RNA constituted by the descending limb of the stem. Effect of HIV-1 Accessory Proteins on the Distribution of Strand Transfer Events—Various viral accessory proteins have been shown to be present in HIV-1 cores (41Welker R. Hohenberg H. Tessmer U. Huckhagel C. Krausslich H.G. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1168-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), possibly participating in the formation of the reverse transcription complex and affecting the mutation rate during reverse transcription (42Mansky L.M. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 134-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To determine whether these viral proteins have any role in the generation of the identified recombination hot spot, we carried out a recombination assay on C2 RNA after generating vector particles deprived of vif, vpr, vpu, and nef proteins, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Template switching occurred at recombination rates similar to those found in the presence of the accessory proteins, as previously observed (43Rhodes T.D. Nikolaitchik O. Chen J. Powell D. Hu W.S. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 1666-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and with preference for the same genomic region (Fig. 3A, right panel). Altogether, these observations suggest that the major determinants for the generation of the hot spot in R2c are not related to the presence of these cofactors and might therefore be determined by other parameters, as could be the primary sequence of this region, or its position in the C2 hairpin. Position Effect on Recombination—The observation that only the descending part of the hairpin constitutes a hot sequence for recombination raises the question of which determinants are responsible for this behavior. We first checked whether the location of R2c in the descending portion was essential for the high efficiency of transfer observed. To this end, we constructed a mutant hairpin where the portions of R2a and R2c engaged in the formation of the upper part of the hairpin were exchanged, as shown in Fig. 2B (SW RNA). The exchange was made maintaining the 3′ to 5′ polarity of the swapped sequences as in the C2 RNA, in such a way that the sequences the RT will come across w"

The aim of the present study was to develop a prosthetic graft that could perform as a small-diameter vascular conduit. Tubular structures of hyaluronan (HYAFF-11 tubules, 2 mm diameter, 1 cm length) were grafted in the abdominal aorta of 30 rats as temporary absorbable guides to promote regeneration of vascular structures. Performance was assessed by histology, immunohistochemistry, and ultra-structural analysis. These experiments resulted in three novel findings: 1) complete endothelialization of the tube's luminal surface occurred; 2) sequential regeneration of vascular components led to complete vascular wall regeneration 15 days after surgery; and 3) the biomaterial used created the ideal environment for the delicate regeneration process during the critical initial phases, yet its biodegradability allowed for complete degradation of the construct four months after implantation, at which time, a new artery remained to connect the artery stumps. This study assesses the feasibility to create a completely biodegradable vascular regeneration guide in vivo, able to sequentially orchestrate vascular regeneration events needed for very small artery reconstruction."
https://openalex.org/W2136498140,"Native uncoupling protein 1 (UCP 1) was purified from rat mitochondria by hydroxyapatite chromatography and identified by peptide mass mapping and tandem mass spectrometry. Native and expressed UCP 1 were reconstituted into liposomes, and proton flux through UCP 1 was shown to be fatty acid-dependent and GDP-sensitive. To investigate the mechanism of action of UCP 1, we determined whether hydrophilic modification of the ω-carbon of palmitate effected its transport function. We show that proton flux was greater through native UCP 1-containing proteoliposomes when facilitated by less hydrophilically modified palmitate (palmitate > ω-methoxypalmitate > ω-hydroxypalmitate with little or no proton flux due to glucose-<i>O</i>-ω-palmitate or undecanesulfonate). We show that non-proton-dependent charge transfer was greater when facilitated by less hydrophilically modified palmitate (palmitate/undecanesulfonate > ω-methoxypalmitate > ω-hydroxypalmitate, with no non-proton-dependent charge transfer flux due to glucose-<i>O</i>-ω-palmitate). We show that the GDP-inhibitable oxygen consumption rate in brown adipose tissue mitochondria was reversed by palmitate (as expected) but not by glucose-<i>O</i>-ω-palmitate. Our data are consistent with the model that UCP 1 flips long-chain fatty acid anions and contradict the ""cofactor"" model of UCP 1 function."

Leishmania is a parasitic protozoan causing an endemic disease affecting 88 countries on four continents (www.who.int/tdr/). Treatment with pentavalent antimony-based drugs has been used for decades. However, toxicity and loss of efficacy with the emergence of resistant strains render necessary the development of alternative therapies.Leishmania exists alternatively as a flagellated extracellular promastigote living inside the alimentary tract of the female sandfly (subfamily phlebotominae) insect vector or as an aflagellated intracellular amastigote within the acidic parasitophorous vacuoles of the mammalian host mononuclear phagocyte (1Hammarton T.C. Mottram J.C. Doerig C. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 2003; 5: 91-101PubMed Google Scholar). During this digenetic life cycle Leishmania encounters major environmental changes that induce parasite differentiation and gene stage-specific expression essential for survival. Some of these dramatic changes are phosphate deprivation, pH acidification, and reduction in extracellular osmolarity.

Redon F. Antoine J.C. Chardin P. DeVos T. Merlin G. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2065-2074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Promastigotes were cultured in closed flasks, under gentle agitation at 24 °C (15Cuvillier A. Redon F. Antoine J.C. Chardin P. DeVos T. Merlin G. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2065-2074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in AM medium, i.e. RPMI 1640 medium plus 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mm glutamine, 2 mg/ml dextrose, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1× minimum Eagle's medium essential and nonessential amino acids, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 8% fetal calf serum (all ingredients were purchased from Eurobio).Phylogenetic Analysis—Amino acid sequences of family I soluble pyrophosphatases (sPPases) were downloaded from GenBank™ data bases or from GeneDB (www.genedb.org/) for trypanosomatid sequences. The pyrophosphatase (PPase) domains were aligned using the multiple alignment options in CLUSTAL X (16Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35182) Google Scholar) followed by minor manual adjustments. The alignment of the sPPase domains has been deposited at EMBL with accession number ALIGN_000878. Phylogenetic trees were generated by the neighbor joining method (17Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar) and maximum parsimony heuristic options as implemented in PAUP version 4.0b10 (Alvitec). Bootstrapping was also carried out using PAUP. The accession numbers of the various sequences used in that study are as follows: 1, BAB22922; 2, AAG36781; 3, AAD24964; 4, XP215416; 5, BAB25754; 6, CAG89198; 7, CAG99536; 8, NP013994.1; 9, P19117; 10, CAE76321; 11, O13505; 12, CAG99833; 13, CAC37330; 14, CAA31629; 15, CAC42762; 16, AAS57950; 17, AAP74700; 18, LmjF11.0210; 19, Tc00.1047053511165.40; 20, Tb11.02.4910; 21, LmjF03.0910; 22, Tc00.1047053508181.140; 23, Tb03.27C5.190; 24, AAC50012; 25, O48556; 26, AAC33503; 27, AAD46520; 28, AAC78101; 29, CAA12415; 30, P17288; 31, O34955; 32, CAA15034; 33, P51064; 34, O05545; 35, O67501; 36, CAB08851; and 37, P38576.Cloning of L. amazonensis VSP1 Gene—A PCR amplification on genomic DNA was performed using the degenerated set of oligonucleotides LmCPPO2 (5′-ATGTTYTCNGCNTTY-3′) and LmCPP03 (5′-TGYTGYTGRTGRTGH-3′) designed from a partial sequence of the Leishmania major VSP1 (AL354096). The amplified DNA fragment of 300 bp was sequenced and used as a probe to screen a cosmid library 3G. Merlin, unpublished data. using the pCosTL vector (gift from John Kelly, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine). The complete sequence of LaVSP1 gene was obtained by direct cosmid sequencing.Expression in Escherichia coli of His6-tagged Native La VSP1 (nLaVSP1) and Mutated LaVSP1 (mLaVSP1) Proteins—The LaVSP1 gene was PCR-amplified with the following primers: Mut1 (5′-CGGCCATATGTCCGATGACACGCGCTACATGTA-3) and Mut3 (5′-CGGCCCTCGAGCACCTCCTCCTTCTTCTTAATCTT-3′) and cloned between the NdeI and XhoI sites of the pET23a vector (Novagen). The mutated LaVSP1 gene was obtained by the overlapping PCR method using the following set of primers: Mut1/Mut2 (GATTTCGACGCCCTCTATTGGGTCGTTGTC-3′) and Mut3/Mut4 (5′-CGACAACGACCCAATAGAGGGCGTCGAAATC-3′). The resulting protein was mutated by a D325E substitution. Both native and mutated proteins were expressed in E. coli (BL21) and purified as described below.Overexpression of mLaVSP1 or nLaVSP1 Proteins in L. amazonensis— Expressions of the mLaVSP1 and nLaVSP1 proteins in L. amazonensis were accomplished by cloning their respective genes in the pFHTLG (gift from Ken Stuart, Seattle Biomedical Research Institute) (18Yan S. Martinez-Calvillo S. Schnaufer A. Sunkin S. Myler P.J. Stuart K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 119: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), between the BglII and AvrII restriction sites and transfection of L. amazonensis (BA125). The genes were obtained by PCR amplification using the pET23a constructions as templates and the following set of primers: LDNcapase1 (5′-GCCGGAGATCTATGTCCGATGACACGCGCTACAAG-3′) and LDNcapase2 (5′-CCTTTCGGGCTTTGTTAGCCCTAGGATCTCAGTG-3′). The mLaVSP1 and the nLaVSP1 proteins were expressed with a His6 tag.For constitutive expression of either nLaVSP1 or mLaVSP1, 108 exponentially growing L. amazonensis BA125 were transfected with the recombinant pFHLTG vectors. The resulting cell lines were called BA125/nLaVSP1 and BA125/mLaVSP1, respectively. To obtain an inducible expression of the same proteins, L. amazonensis was previously transfected with the pTupactet construct (18Yan S. Martinez-Calvillo S. Schnaufer A. Sunkin S. Myler P.J. Stuart K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 119: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The resulting cell lines were called BA125In/nLaVSP1 and BA125In/mLaVSP1, respectively. Protein expression was induced by culturing cells in culture medium with 50 μg/ml hygromycin and 1 μg/ml tetracycline for 1 week.Conditions of Electroporation—Briefly, 108 cells were washed and resuspended in 200 μl of cold electroporation buffer (21 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mm NaH2PO4, 6 mm glucose). 50 μgof plasmid DNA were added, and the cells were electroporated at 0 °C in 2-mm cuvettes with a Cellject apparatus set on 450 V, 74 W, 600 microfarads, single pulse mode (15Cuvillier A. Redon F. Antoine J.C. Chardin P. DeVos T. Merlin G. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2065-2074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).To integrate the Tet-R gene into the tubulin locus, pTupactet vector was digested with KpnI and NotI, and the cells were electroporated with 5 μg of this DNA preparation. The cells with integrated pTupactet DNA were selected by the addition of 45 μg/ml puromycin. These cells were then transfected by the recombinants pFHTLG vectors (as described above) and selected by the addition of 10 μg/ml hygromycin.Purification of the Recombinant nLaVSP1 and mLaVSP1 Proteins by Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography—The recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli were purified from the His.Bind® column according to the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen). Before performing the PPase assay, the enzyme was desalted in MES buffer (50 mm MES/NaOH, pH 6.5, 500 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2) on a PD10 column (Amersham Biosciences) and stored in that buffer.Different affinities of PPi to Mg2+ as a function of pH render the Mg2+ dependences for PPases complex (19Halonen P. Tammenkoski M. Niiranen L. Huopalahti S. Parfenyev A.N. Goldman A. Baykov A. Lahti R. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4004-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Some buffers such as Tris modulate E. coli PPase activity (20Baykov A.A. Hyytia T. Turkina M.V. Efimova I.S. Kasho V.N. Goldman A. Cooperman B.S. Lahti R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 308-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) We therefore stored the enzyme in MES/NaOH, pH 6.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and 250 mm NaCl. The reactions were then performed in reaction buffers containing either Mg2+ or Zn2+ and at different pH levels.PPase and Exopolyphosphatase Activity— 0.020–2 μg of desalted nLaVSP1 and mLaVSP1 proteins were incubated at 25 °C for 1 min to hydrolyze PPi and 2 min for either polyP3 or polyP28. The reaction was stopped, and released Pi was quantified as described by Shatton et al. (21Shatton J.B. Ward C. Williams A. Weinhouse S. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). MES/NaOH buffer was used from pH 5.5 to 6.5 and Tris-HCl from pH 7.0 to 8.8. Before use, polyP28 was purified on G25 Sephadex.For each substrate concentration tested a blank value, corresponding to the same reaction conditions but without the enzyme, was subtracted from the values obtained in the presence of the enzyme. Because polyP3 hydrolysis produces Pi and PPi, which could be hydrolyzed to Pi, we used the equation developed for an enzyme with two substrates, as published by Zyryanov et al. (22Zyryanov A.B. Shestakov A.S. Lahti R. Baykov A.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 901-906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to calculate the Michaelis constants.Determination of Protein Concentration—Protein concentration was estimated by the method of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213254) Google Scholar), by Coomassie staining after SDS-PAGE, and/or by Western blotting.Western Blot Analysis of the mLaVSP1 and nLaVSP1 as Extracted from Leishmania—3×106 cells were lysed with SDS and a pool of protease inhibitors, boiled for 5 min, and then submitted to 12.5% SDS-PAGE with standard markers (Promega).The proteins were transferred onto Immobilon P membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Rabbit immune serum (1:5,000 dilution) and goat anti-rabbit Ig/peroxidase (1:10,000 dilution) were used. Staining was done with ECL™ Western blotting detection reagents as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were scanned to produce initial images, and the protein bands were quantified using NIH Image software.Metacyclic Promastigote Purification—Leishmania cells were harvested when in stationary phase and then washed twice in PBS; the cell suspension was adjusted to 5×108 cells/ml and incubated 30 min at room temperature with a 1:500 dilution of monoclonal antibody 3A1, kindly provided by Dr. Elvira Maria. Saraiva (24Chaves C.S. Soares D.C. Da Silva R.P. Saraiva E.M. Exp. Parasitol. 2003; 103: 152-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This antibody is directed against the L. amazonensis promastigote forms. The cell suspension was then centrifuged at 250 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was washed twice in PBS, and unagglutinated, i.e. metacyclic, promastigotes were counted using a Malassez hemacytometer.Macrophage Infection by the Metacyclic Form—Macrophages were obtained from BALB/c mice as described (25Antoine J.C. Jouanne C. Lang T. Prina E. de Chastellier C. Frehel C. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 764-775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by in vitro differentiation of bone marrow precursor cells in 24-well plates containing 12-mm-diameter round glass coverslips for light microscopy studies. Precursors were deposited in 60-mm cultures dishes. The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Eurobio) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Eurobio), 40 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate, 20% L-929 fibroblast-conditioned medium. After 5 days at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 nonadherent cells were removed, and adherent macrophages were further harvested and incubated in culture medium containing only 2% of conditioned medium at the concentration of 106 cell/ml in 24-well plates containing 12-mm-diameter round glass coverslips (18–24 h before the addition of the parasites). Macrophages were infected by stationary phase promastigotes, metacyclic promastigotes, at a ratio of four parasites/macrophage. The parasites and macrophages were brought into contact by incubation at 4 °C for 4 h before being washed with Dulbecco's PBS (Seromed) to remove free parasites. Macrophages were fixed either immediately or 1–72 h after infection. The cells were fixed with methanol and stained with Giemsa for 15 min at room temperature. The coverslips were finally mounted on microscope slides with Mowiol (Calbiochem). The percentage of infected macrophages (of 600–700 cells) and the mean number of amastigotes/infected macrophage (of 150–200 cells) were determined using an inverted microscope.Infectivity Tests—Leishmania promastigotes were cultured for up to 8 weeks after recovery from footpad lesions and harvested in early stationary phase of growth (5–6 days after last passage). 106 promastigotes were injected into BALB/c mouse footpads, and lesion diameters were determined weekly with a caliper.Immunofluorescence—12-mm-diameter round glass coverslips were treated for 30 min in 10 μg/ml poly-l-lysine (>300 kDa; Sigma) in 24-well tissue culture plates (Costar) (15Cuvillier A. Redon F. Antoine J.C. Chardin P. DeVos T. Merlin G. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2065-2074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Leishmania promastigotes (106 cells/well) were added, and the plates were centrifuged at 130 × g for 10 min, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 1 h, and sequentially incubated for 10 min with 50 mm NH4Cl for 30 min with 10% mouse serum (Jackson laboratories) plus 10% goat serum (Eurobio) in PBS, 1 h with 1:100 dilution of mouse anti-poly-His5 antibody (Qiagen) and 1:1,000 dilution of rabbit anti-VP1 immune serum or 1:1,000 dilution of rabbit anti-exopolyphosphatase immune serum in 0.25% (w/v) gelatin (Sigma) and 1 h with 10 μg/ml fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig antibody (Jackson Laboratories) and 10 μg/ml rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig antibody (Jackson Laboratories) in 0.25% (w/v) gelatin. The coverslips were mounted on microscope slides with Mowiol (Calbiochem). Cell preparations were examined under a conventional Zeiss Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscope. The images were acquired with a Princeton Instruments camera and analyzed with Metaview™ (Universal Imaging).6-Diamino-2-phenylindol (DAPI) Accumulation Observed by Fluorescence Microscopy—12-mm-diameter round glass poly-l-lysine-treated coverslips (>300 kDa; Sigma) were used in 24-well tissue culture plates (Costar). Leishmania promastigotes (106 cells/well) were washed twice Dulbecco's PBS and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in PBS with 10 μg/ml DAPI. Then cells were added in the 24-well tissue culture plates containing the 12-mm-diameter round glass coverslips treated and centrifuged at 130 × g for 10 min. The coverslips were mounted on microscope slides without Mowiol nor resin. PolyP and DNA were detected using the DAPI filter from Zeiss (set 02) and by exposing for 200 ms for polyP detection. DAPI has a fluorescence emission maximum at 456 nm. PolyP shift DAPI fluorescence to a higher wavelength, with a maximum of 525 nm (26Tijssen J.P. Beekes H.W. Van Steveninck J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 721: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONLaVSP1 Gene Cloning and Phylogenetic Analysis—Cloning and sequencing of LaVSP1 were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A search in the L. major genome sequence data base (www.genedb.org) with BLAST algorithms, using the LaVSP1 protein sequence, indicated the existence of only one copy of VSP1, which localized on chromosome 11 (LmjF11.0210). The LaVSP1 and LmVSP1 protein sequences only differ in 15 amino acids (ALIGN_000878), and none of them correspond to amino acids involved in the catalytic center (27Sivula T. Salminen A. Parfenyev A.N. Pohjanjoki P. Goldman A. Cooperman B.S. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). LaVSP1 gene codes for a protein of 443 amino acids (28Lemercier G. Bakalara N. Santarelli X. J. Chromatogr. B. 2003; 786: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison analysis (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) revealed that LaVSP1 exhibits 64% sequence identity with the TbVSP1 (ALIGN_000878). In addition to the pyrophosphatase domain, LaVSP1 has a large N-terminal extension region of 160 amino acids, as previously observed for TbVSP1 (28Lemercier G. Bakalara N. Santarelli X. J. Chromatogr. B. 2003; 786: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This region contains a calcium-binding type II EF-hand domain (COG5126, FRQ1) between positions 111 and 173.Phylogenetic protein analysis of LaVSP1 and the cytosolic soluble pyrophosphatase of Leishmania was performed with other family I sPPases of various bacteria and eukaryotes (Fig. 1). Both Leishmania acidocalcisomal (LaVSP1) and cytosolic proteins cluster with the animal/fungus PPase family (27Sivula T. Salminen A. Parfenyev A.N. Pohjanjoki P. Goldman A. Cooperman B.S. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), which also contains the plastid enzymes from plants. The mitochondrial and cytosolic PPases of the animal/fungus family probably duplicated and diverged after the speciation (Fig. 1). In contrast, the cytosolic enzymes from plants do not cluster with the other eukaryotic enzymes, including the plastid PPases, suggesting that each plant isoform has a different origin. The origin of the two trypanosomatid PPases is not clear. Indeed, the trypanosomatid isoforms show a paraphyletic organization, and the acidocalcisomal PPases are closer to the animal/fungus PPases than to the cytosolic PPases. This observation suggests that the trypanosomatid acidocalcisomal and cytosolic PPases diverged before the trypanosomatid and animal/fungus speciation, giving rise to two different deep branches of PPases. Alternatively, they may have a different origin as proposed for the plant isoforms. One may speculate that trypanosomatid cytosolic and/or acidocalcisomal PPases have a plant origin, as previously hypothesized for many other metabolic enzymes from trypanosomatids (29Hannaert V. Saavedra E. Duffieux F. Szikora J.P. Rigden D.J. Michels P.A. Opperdoes F.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1067-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). However, this view is not strongly supported by the topology of the PPase tree because the chloroplast and VSP1 PPases do not constitute a monophyletic group. In any case, this paraphyletic organization, well supported by the bootstrap values, suggests that trypanosomatid VSP1 and cytosolic PPases may carry different functions.TbVSP1 expression, in both the insect and mammalian hosts, its acidocalcisome localization, and its ability to hydrolyze both PPi and polyP (30Lemercier G. Dutoya S. Luo S. Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Baltz T. Docampo R. Bakalara N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37369-37376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) are the representative cellular and biochemical features of TbVSP1. We therefore analyzed LaVSP1 for its expression throughout the L. amazonensis life cycle, its cellular localization, and biochemical specificities.Differential Expression and Localization of LaVSP1—Relative expression level quantification between LACK (Leishmania homologue of receptors for activated C kinase) (31Mougneau E. Altare F. Wakil A.E. Zheng S. Coppola T. Wang Z.E. Waldmann R. Locksley R.M. Glaichenhaus N. Science. 1995; 268: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and LaVSP1 proteins was estimated at different life cycle stages of L. amazonensis. Fig. 2 shows that LaVSP1 expression levels were regulated throughout the parasite life cycle. Namely, expression in metacyclic forms was three times greater than in the exponentially growing promastigotes and six times greater than in the amastigote stage. We determined by indirect immunofluorescence LaVSP1 localization in genetically modified L. amazonensis promastigotes (Ba125/nLaVSP1) expressing a recombinant His6-tagged nLaVSP1 using an anti-His5 monoclonal antibody. The results shown in Fig. 3D indicate that nLaVSP1 localized to vesicle-like structures of various sizes mainly distributed around the nucleus. Such cellular organization is typical of acidocalcisome distribution (32Docampo R. Moreno S.N. Parasitol. Today. 1999; 15: 443-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Next, to refine this localization, a rabbit antisera directed against the T. brucei vacuolar proton translocating pyrophosphatase (TbVP1) was used in a colocalization study (Fig. 3) with nLaVSP1 as an acidocalcisome marker on the Ba125/nLaVSP1 strain (30Lemercier G.

The results shown in Fig. 3 indicated that LaVP1 and nLaVSP1 colocalized. In addition, LaVSP1 was also found in some vesicles where LaVP1 was not detected (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 2Expression analysis by Western blotting of LaVSP1 throughout the L. amazonensis life cycle. LaVSP1 and LACK expressions were quantified at the amastigote stage (AM), metacyclic stages (META), and different life cycle stages of procyclics (PRO). exp shows the exponential growth phase, stat shows the stationary growth phase, and stat-lt shows the late stationary growth phase. Rabbit antisera directed against TbVSP1 (28Lemercier G. Bakalara N. Santarelli X. J. Chromatogr. B. 2003; 786: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and LACK (gift from J. C. Antoine, Institut Pasteur Paris) were used to probe the LaVSP1 and LACK proteins, respectively. The values in the figure indicate the ratios of LaVSP1/LACK expression levels over the ratios of LaVSP1/LACK expression levels at the exponential growth stage. Therefore, the value is 1 for the expression of LaVSP1 at the exponential growth stage.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3Colocalization analysis by indirect immunofluorescence of LaVSP1 and LaVP1 in L. amazonensis.

https://openalex.org/W1995555550,"In topogenesis of membrane proteins on the endoplasmic reticulum, the orientation of the hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) segment is influenced by the charge of the flanking amino acid residues. We assessed the function of the positive charges downstream of the hydrophobic segment using synaptotagmin II. The positive charges were systematically replaced with non-charged residues. Although the original TM segment translocated the N terminus, the topology was inverted, depending on the mutations. Orientation was affected in mutants in which 6 Lys were shifted downstream, even when the 6 Lys were 25 residues from the hydrophobic segment. The Lys was functionally replaced by Arg, but not by Asp or Glu. The timing of action during polypeptide elongation indicated that the Lys functions at the ribosome exit sites. We suggest that the commitment of the TM segment to a particular orientation is influenced by far downstream parts of the polypeptide chain and that the positive charges are decoded after exiting the ribosome.

The ribosomes are targeted to the ER membrane by the signal recognition particle, and the nascent polypeptide chains are integrated into the membrane, mediated by the translocon (1Hegde R.S. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1997; 91: 575-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The signal sequences, which are primarily defined by a hydrophobic segment (H-segment) in the nascent polypeptide chain, are inserted into the translocon to form the two possible alternative orientations. When the following portion is translocated through the translocon, it results in an Ncyt/Clum orientation in which the N terminus is on the cytoplasmic side and the C terminus is on the lumenal side of the membrane. Cleavable signal peptides and one of the non-cleavable signal-anchor sequences (SA-II sequence) have this orientation. When the preceding portion is translocated, it results in the Nlum/Ccyt orientation (2Sakaguchi M. von Heijne G. Membrane Protein Assembly. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1997: 135-150Google Scholar). This type of signal-anchor sequence occurs in various membrane proteins (e.g. microsomal cytochrome P450 isoforms, synaptotagmin isoforms, and some viral membrane proteins) and are termed type I signal-anchor sequences (SA-I sequences) because they have the so-called type I orientation and remain as membrane anchor segments (3Sakaguchi M. Tomiyoshi R. Kuroiwa T. Mihara K. Omura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 16-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).The H-segments of the signal-anchor sequences are composed of 17-27 residues, and those of signal peptides are 7-14 residues (4Nilsson I. Whitley P. von Heijne G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The longer H-segment and fewer positive charges in the N-terminal domain (N-domain) often cause translocation of the N-terminal side and result in an SA-I topology (5Goder V. Spiess M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The charged amino acid residues in the flanking regions greatly affect the orientation (6Gafvelin G. Sakaguchi M. Andersson H. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6119-6127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The effect of positive charge has been also established in statistical analysis as the “positive inside rule”, in which positively charged amino acids tend to be more prevalent on the cytoplasmic than on the extra-cytoplasmic side of TM proteins (5Goder V. Spiess M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). More specifically, it has been proposed that charge differences in the 15 residues flanking both sides of the H-segment determine the orientation; the more positive side is retained on the cytoplasmic side (7Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Although the effect of the charge is established, the details of its function have not been clarified. We extensively examined the topogenesis process of the SA-I sequence of the synaptotagmin II (SytII) molecule, which exists in the secretory vesicles of neurons and is responsible for Ca2+-regulated secretion at neuron terminals (8Schiavo G. Osborne S.L. Sgouros J.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 9Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 379-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Mouse SytII possesses a 60-residue N-domain, a 27-residue hydrophobic TM segment, and the following cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 1). The targeting of the SA-I sequence of SytII to the ER membrane occurs just after the H-segment emerges from the ribosome, and translocation occurs after the elongation proceeds past the following several residues. The positive charges following the H-segment are essential for N-domain translocation, and deletion of 8 Lys residues just after the H-segment results in an inversion of the H-segment topography (10Kida Y. Sakaguchi M. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Mihara K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 719-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Recently, it was suggested that the yeast translocon subunit Sec61p participates in decoding positive charges of signal-anchor sequences (11Goder V. Junne T. Spiess M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1470-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).In this study, we examined the effect of the number and position of positive charges immediately following the H-segment of SytII on topogenic function and estimated the timing of the action during polypeptide chain elongation. The positive charges had additive effects, irrespective of their position within the flanking region. The 6-Lys cluster was effective on the topology even when the cluster was 25 residues away from the H-segment. When the Lys cluster was shifted downstream, the timing of the N-domain translocation was delayed. A similar position effect was observed with another model protein, neuregulin-1β (NRG-1β). We suggest that the orientation of the H-segment can be suspended until the following polypeptide of more than 25 residues enters the translocon.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Preparations of rough microsomal membranes (RM) (12Walter P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) and rabbit reticulocyte lysate (13Jackson R.J. Hunt T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 50-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) were performed as described previously. Cycloheximide was purchased from Sigma. Rabbit antiserum for SytII (14Fukuda M. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Aimoto S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29206-29211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and antiserum for dog Sec61α were described previously (10Kida Y. Sakaguchi M. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Mihara K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 719-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Antiserum against dog translocating chain-associating membrane protein (TRAM) was raised against a synthetic peptide of the N-terminal 15 residues. The photoactivatable amino acid l-4′-(3-[tri-fluoromethyl]-3H-diazirin-3-yl) phenylalanine ((Tmd)Phe) was loaded onto amber suppresser tRNA using (Tmd)Phe-pdCpA (Photoprobes) essentially as described previously (15High S.

Mikoshiba K. Mihara K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 719-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The cDNA was subcloned between HindIII and XbaI sites of pRcCMV (Invitrogen), which possesses both the T7 RNA polymerase promoter for in vitro transcription and the cytomegalovirus promoter for expression in cultured cells. The sequence from the HindIII site to the initiation methionine was AAGCTTCCACCATGG. Using the Kunkel mutagenesis method (17Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4886) Google Scholar), all but one glycosylation site (Asn32 or Asn208) was silenced to obtain the N32-protein (T210A, S343S, T384A) and the N208-protein (T34A, S343A, T384A). Substitutions of Lys with neutral polar residues, shifting of the Lys cluster, formations of AflII sites in the open reading frame, and insertion of the amber codon (TAG) at point 111 of 20-6K mutants were performed using the Kunkel method. Insertion of charged amino acid residues (Asp, Arg, and Glu) and the formation of stop codons were performed using the polymerase cycle reaction procedure (18Weiner M.P. Costa G.L. Schoettlin W. Cline J. Mathur E. Bauer J.C. Gene. 1994; 151: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar).cDNA for NRG-1β was obtained from human fetal brain total RNA by reverse transcription-PCR and then subcloned between HindIII and XbaI sites of pRcCMV. Deletion and insertions of positive charges were performed using the Kunkel method. After the construction, PCR fragments encoding Met-Ala plus Ser150-Val645 of the wild-type and mutated NRG-1β were subcloned between NcoI and EcoRI of pSPBP4 (19Siegel V. Walter P. Cell. 1988; 52: 39-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) to generate Δ147 mutant. Because NRG-1β has an NcoI site in open reading frame, the NcoI-EcoRI fragment was subcloned, and then the NcoI-NcoI fragment was inserted into the NcoI site.The generated amino acid sequences of the constructed mutants are indicated in the figures. All the mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The oligonucleotide sequences used are available from the author.In Vitro Analysis—In vitro transcription and translation were performed essentially as described previously (20Ota K. Sakaguchi M. von Heijne G. Hamasaki N. Mihara K. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 495-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 21Sakaguchi M. Hachiya N. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biochem. 1992; 112: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For SytII mRNA with a termination codon, plasmids were linearized at the XhoI site and transcribed by T7-RNA polymerase. For the truncated mRNAs, plasmids were linearized at the AflII site, which was created at various points in the open reading frame. The template for NRG-1β was linearized by EcoRI and transcribed by SP6 RNA polymerase.The mRNAs coding for the full-length molecule were translated for 1 h at 30 °C in the reticulocyte lysate cell-free system in the presence of 15.5 kBq/μl of EXPRESS protein-labeling mix (PerkinElmer) of [35S]Met and [35S]Cys. The truncated mRNAs were translated at 25 °C for 20-40 min according to length. Translation was terminated by the addition of cycloheximide, and the mixture was further incubated at 25 °C for 30 min to complete the translocation and glycosylation. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent image analysis using BAS1800II (Fujifilm). The intensities of the protein bands were estimated, and the glycosylation efficiency (%) of either site (N32% or N208%) was calculated using the following formula: [glycosylated form] × 100/([glycosylated form] + [unglycosylated form]). Percent glycosylation can be used as an estimation of membrane insertion of either the N- or C-terminal domain (C-domain) (see “Results”). The topology percentage (%) of SA-I was calculated using the following formula: N32(%) × 100/[N32(%) + N208(%)], and the topology percentage (%) of SA-II was calculated using the following formula: N208(%) × 100/[N32(%) + N208(%)].The truncated mRNAs coding for amber111 mutant of 20-6K protein were translated in the presence of suppressor tRNA with a photoactivatable amino acid, (Tmd)Phe-amber suppresser tRNA. The reaction mixtures were supplemented with 2 mm cycloheximide and transferred to a 96-well plate. They were UV irradiated (365 nm) on ice for 15 min. The irradiated samples were resolved with 1% SDS and diluted with 10 volumes of immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Trasyrol) and then immunoprecipitated using Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and antiserum against TRAM. The residual supernatants were then immunoprecipitated by anti-Sec61α antiserum. The radiolabeled proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent image analysis.For proteinase K (ProK) treatment, the translation mixture was incubated with 0.2 mg/ml of ProK for 30 min on ice. The reaction mixture was diluted with 10 volumes of high salt buffer (0.5 m KOAc, 2.5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 30 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated for 10 min on ice. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the membrane pellet was solubilized with sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. Aliquots of the membrane precipitates and translation mixtures were subjected to endoglycosidase H treatment according to the manufacturer's protocol.Expression in COS7 Cells—COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (D6429; Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences) under an atmosphere of 10% CO2 at 37 °C. For transfection, COS7 cells were seeded in 3.5-cm wells (2 × 105 cells/well). After culturing for 24 h, the expression plasmids (1 μg) were transfected with FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After culturing for 24 h, the cells were pulse labeled with 3.7 MBq/500 μl of medium [35S]Met of EXPRESS protein-labeling mix for 10 min and lysed with 2% SDS. SytII was immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-SytII antibodies as described previously (22Kanki T. Sakaguchi M. Kitamura A. Sato T. Mihara K. Hamasaki N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13973-13981Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).RESULTSEffect of the Number of Positive Charges—To estimate the topology of model proteins derived from SytII, all potential glycosylation sites except one in either the N-domain (Asn32) or C-domain (Asn208) were silenced (Fig. 1A). If the H-segment forms a TM orientation, either site should be glycosylated (Fig. 1B). There are 8 Lys residues among the 12 residues following the H-segment of SytII (Fig. 2A, WT). We first examined the effect of the number of Lys residues on topogenic properties. The 8 Lys residues were systematically replaced with polar, but non-charged, residues (Asn, Ser, or Gln) using the N32 and N208 proteins (Fig. 2A). The plasmid DNAs were linearized with the XhoI site and transcribed in vitro. The synthesized mRNA was translated in a reticulocyte lysate cell-free system in the presence of RM, and radioactive proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent image analysis (Fig. 2B). The wild-type was glycosylated predominantly in the N-domain (Fig. 2B, lane 1), but not in the C-domain (Fig. 2B, lane 10). In contrast, the mutant in which all 8 Lys were replaced was glycosylated predominantly in the C-domain (Fig. 2B, lane 11) and only slightly in the N-domain (Fig. 2B, lane 2). When 4 of 8 Lys residues were changed (–KKKK–), both sites were significantly glycosylated (Fig. 2B, lanes 9 and 18). In all cases, endoglycosidase H treatment shifted the upper bands down (data not shown), confirming that they were glycosylated forms.FIGURE 2Effect of the number of Lys residues on topology. A, 8 Lys residues following the H-segment of SytII were systematically mutated into non-charged polar residues. Only the changed residues are indicated. B, the altered proteins were expressed in a cell-free system in the presence of RM. The synthesized molecules were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and image analysis. Open and closed circles indicate glycosylated and unglycosylated forms, respectively. C, after the translation of three typical altered proteins, the reaction mixtures were subjected to ProK treatment (ProK + lanes), and then the membrane vesicles were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Aliquots of ProK-treated samples were further treated with endoglycosidase H (EndoH + lanes). The ProK-resistant fragments of N-domains and C-domains are indicated by up and down arrows, respectively. D, the glycosylation (%) of each protein was calculated from the formula [glycosylated form] × 100/([glycosylated form] + [unglycosylated form]). Those of the N-domain (N32) and C-domain (N208) are indicated by a black bar and white bar, respectively. Experiments with each protein were performed at least two times, and the results were reproducible. E, the percentages of each orientation among the inserted molecules were calculated. The topology percentage (%) of SA-I was calculated from the formula N32(%)× 100/[N32(%) + N208(%)]. That of SA-II was from the formula N208(%) × 100/[N32(%) + N208(%)]. SA-I(%) and SA-II(%) are indicated by squares and circles, respectively. Results of the altered proteins in which Lys residues were deleted from the N-terminal side, C-terminal side, and both sides are indicated by white, gray, and black symbols, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine the glycosylation efficiency of the glycosylation site translocated into the lumenal side, the reaction mixtures were subjected to ProK treatment, which degraded the polypeptide chain on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Membrane vesicles were then isolated by ultracentrifugation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2C). When the wild-type SytII was treated with ProK, a small peptide fragment including the N-domain and the TM segment was observed (Fig. 2C, lanes 2 and 5). Endoglycosidase H treatment shifted the N32 protein down to the same molecular weight as the N208 protein (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 6). The ProK-resistant unglycosylated form was not observed, indicating that the inserted N-domain was completely glycosylated. In contrast, the 0-Lys mutant (——–) resulted in a large ProK-resistant fragment including the TM segment and C-domain (Fig. 2C, lanes 8 and 11). Only the fragment of N208 protein was endoglycosidase sensitive. Again, the ProK-resistant fragment was completely glycosylated (Fig. 2C, lanes 11 and 12). The 4-Lys mutant (–KKKK–) gave a pattern that was a mixture of those of the wild-type and the 0-Lys mutant (Fig. 2C, lanes 14, 15, 17, and 18). In this case, the glycosylation sites in the ProK-resistant fragment were 100% glycosylated. All the ProK protection experiments demonstrated that the glycosylation of the inserted segment was almost 100% in the lumen. It is reasonable to conclude that glycosylation is a direct indication of the membrane insertion.Thus, the glycosylation of wild-type molecules indicated that 80% of the nascent chain was inserted in the SA-I topology, and 20% was not inserted into the membrane (Fig. 2D). In contrast, 10% of the 0-Lys mutant had an SA-I topology and 70% had an SA-II topology. In our cell-free system, an integration efficiency of 80% is standard with SytII.The orientations of other mutants were quantified. The sum of the insertion yields was nearly 80% with all the altered proteins, indicating that they were inserted into the membrane with a similar efficiency of 80% and that the insertion efficiency was not affected by the charge mutations (Fig. 2D). The orientation on the membrane can thus be estimated by the ratio of glycosylation of the N32 and N208 (termed topology percentage) (Fig. 2E). The orientation of the mutants was affected by the number of positive charges, irrespective of the position within this region; i.e. 4-Lys mutations resulted in a similar orientation independent of the positions. The clear additive effects of Lys on the orientation confirmed the topogenic function of the positive charges.Effect of Positions of the Positive Charges—We next addressed the position effect of the Lys cluster on membrane orientation. Two Lys were kept just after the H-segment to determine the boundary of the H-segment, and the 6-Lys cluster was systematically shifted downstream in 5-residue increments (Fig. 3A). The mutant with only 2 Lys (KK——) had a predominantly Ncyt/Clum (SA-II) orientation (70%), whereas the mutant with the 6-Lys cluster at 5 residues from H-segment had a 100% SA-I orientation (Fig. 3B). The effect gradually decreased as the distance from the H-segment increased. Unexpectedly, the 6-Lys cluster, separated by 25 and 30 residues from the H-segment, still had significant effects on orientation.FIGURE 3Effect of distance of positive charges from the H-segment. A, The 6-Lys cluster was moved downstream. The clusters are indicated by bold-faced characters and boxes. B, the proteins were analyzed as in Fig. 2. Glycosylated and unglycosylated forms are indicated by open and closed circles, respectively (upper panel). Topology (%) of membrane-integrated molecules was calculated (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To address the effect of the charged residues on topogenesis in living cells, we expressed the altered proteins in cultured COS cells. Newly synthesized proteins were pulse labeled and immunoprecipitated. The 10-min pulse labeling eliminated the possibility of selective degradation of a set of topologic forms. The glycosylation of the inserted domain should be almost complete as shown with the cell-free system. The effect of the 6-Lys cluster position was more apparent in the cultured cells; there were significant effects even when separated by 30 residues from the H-segment (Fig. 4). Although the position effect was somewhat different from that in the cell-free system for unknown reasons, we have concluded that the Nlum orientation was more favorable than the Ncyt orientation in cultured cells and that the Lys cluster was effective even when it was separated by more than 25 residues from the H-segment. Taken together, the 6-Lys cluster affected the topology from more distant positions than previously assumed.FIGURE 4Effect of distance of positive charges assessed in COS7 cells. The N32 proteins possessing the 6-Lys clusters at various sites were expressed in COS7 cells, pulse labeled for 10 min, and immunoprecipitated with anti-SytII antibodies. The proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent image analysis. Glycosylated and unglycosylated forms are indicated by open and closed circles, respectively. The glycosylation (%) of N32 was calculated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of Other Charged Residues—The effects of other charged amino acid residues were examined at positions 5 or 25 from the H-segment (Fig. 5). Arg and Lys had similar effects on N-domain translocation. When they were separated by 25 residues from the H-segment, Lys had a slightly more prominent effect than Arg. Hermansson et al. (23Hermansson M. Monne M. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) reported that when positioned after the H-segment to examine the ability to induce a helical hairpin, the topogenic function of the Asp residue was comparable with Lys. In the context used in the present study, however, both of the negatively charged residues Asp and Glu had significant but very weak effects on topogenesis. The effects of Asp and Glu clusters positioned 5 residues from the H-segment were weaker than those of the Lys cluster positioned 25 residues from the H-segment. The contribution of the negatively charged residues is not clear compared with those of positively charged residues.FIGURE 5Effect of other charged residues on the topology of SytII. A, the 6-Lys clusters at 5 and 25 residues from the H-segment were changed into Arg, Asp, and Glu clusters. Changed residues are indicated by bold-faced characters and boxes. B, the altered proteins were analyzed as in Fig. 2. Glycosylated and unglycosylated forms are indicated by open and closed circles, respectively. The topology (%) of SA-I and SA-II are indicated by the black and white boxes, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Timing of Positive Charge Function—Liao et al. (24Liao S. Lin J. Do H. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the H-segment of the nascent polypeptide chain can be sensed within the ribosome tunnel. Although the positive charges immediately following the H-segment seem to function at the exit site of the ribosome (10Kida Y. Sakaguchi M. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Mihara K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 719-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the Lys residues further downstream might also be sensed within the ribosome. To determine the timing of this action, we examined the effect of the length of the nascent polypeptide chain on N-domain translocation using the 5-6K and 20-6K proteins (Fig. 6). To generate intermediates of polypeptide chain elongation, mRNAs truncated at various positions were obtained by transcription of template DNAs linearized at the AflII site, which was generated at various locations within the open reading frame. The mRNA possessed no termination codon so that the nascent polypeptide chain remained bound to the ribosome as peptidyl-tRNA to form a ribosome nascent chain complex. When translated in the presence of RM, nascent chains with the expected molecular weights were synthesized as major bands (Fig. 6A). A clear difference of glycosylation between the 5-6K and 20-6K proteins was observed at the length of 136 and 141 residues. In the case of the 5-6K, the N-domain was translocated depending simply on the length of the nascent chain. The 136-residue nascent chain was efficiently glycosylated, as reported previously using wild-type SytII molecule (10Kida Y. Sakaguchi M. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Mihara K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 719-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast, the N-domain translocation lagged in 20-6K. At a length of 126 residues, the 20-6K protein was glycosylated by 20%, similar to the 5-6K protein. The integration was highly likely to be independent of the 6-Lys cluster (Fig. 6A). Despite the lag, the 146-residue 20-6K protein was as efficiently glycosylated as the 5-6K protein. In contrast, both proteins translocated the N-domain, when a termination codon was created instead of making the truncated mRNA (Fig. 6A, open symbols). Even when the termination codon was created just after the positive charges, the N-domain was efficiently translocated. The 6-Lys cluster and H-segment in the shorter nascent chain bound to the ribosomes could not function because they were masked by ribosomes. When the nascent chain was released from the ribosomes, the downstream Lys cluster functioned as efficiently as that positioned just after the H-segment. These data indicated that the N-domain translocation up to a nascent chain length of 126 is due to two lysine residues (Lys88-Lys89). In the 5-6K protein, the 6-Lys cluster closely follows the H-segment, and the resulting curve was monophasic. In the 20-6K protein, however, the 6-Lys cluster emerges 15 residues downstream and is functional only in the longer nascent chains.FIGURE 6Timing of Lys cluster function. A, truncated RNAs encoding"
https://openalex.org/W2017592458,"A subset of DNA helicases, the RecQ family, has been found to be associated with the p53-mediated apoptotic pathway and is involved in maintaining genomic integrity. This family contains the BLM and WRN helicases, in which germline mutations are responsible for Bloom and Werner syndromes, respectively. TFIIH DNA helicases, XPB and XPD, are also components in this apoptotic pathway. We hypothesized that there may be some redundancy between helicases in their ability to complement the attenuated p53-mediated apoptotic levels seen in cells from individuals with diseases associated with these defective helicase genes. The attenuated apoptotic phenotype in Bloom syndrome cells was rescued not only by ectopic expression of BLM, but also by WRN or XPB, both 3′ → 5′ helicases, but not expression of the 5′ → 3′ helicase XPD. Overexpression of Sgs1, a WRN/BLM yeast homolog, corrected the reduction in BS cells only, which is consistent with Sgs1 being evolutionarily most homologous to BLM. A restoration of apoptotic levels in cells from WS, XPB or XPD patients was attained only by overexpression of the specific helicase. Our data suggest a limited redundancy in the pathways of these RecQ helicases in p53-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2029152270,"Tpl2/Cot is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a key physiological role in the regulation of immune responses to pro-inflammatory stimuli, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). TNF-α stimulates the JNK, ERK, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases and the NF-κB pathway by recruiting RIP1 and TRAF2 to the TNF receptor 1. Here we showed that Tpl2 activation by TNF-α signals depends on the integrity of the Tpl2-interacting proteins RIP1 and TRAF2, which are required for the engagement of the ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. However, neither RIP1 nor TRAF2 overexpression was sufficient to activate Tpl2 and ERK. We also showed that Tpl2 activation by TNF-α depends on a tyrosine kinase activity that is detected in TNF-α-stimulated cells. Based on both genetic and biochemical evidence, we concluded that in a variety of cell types, Syk is the tyrosine kinase that plays an important role in the activation of Tpl2 upstream of ERK. These data therefore dissect the TNF receptor 1 proximal events that regulate Tpl2 and ERK and highlight a role for RIP1, TRAF2, and Syk in this pathway.

However, a detailed analysis of these mice revealed a critical role for Tpl2 in the regulation of innate and adaptive immunity and in the response to inflammatory signals through the modulation of the ERK MAPK signaling pathway. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated Tpl2–/– macrophages exhibit impaired synthesis of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and cyclooxygenase-2, because of a specific defect in ERK activation (10Dumitru C.D.

In other studies we found that Tpl2 is also required for the transduction of ERK activation signals initiated by CD40 engagement and contributes to IgE synthesis in B lymphocytes stimulated with interleukin 4 and anti-CD40 mAb (12Eliopoulos A.G. Wang C.C. Dumitru C.D. Tsichlis P.N. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3855-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Similarly, we found that ERK phosphorylation induced by TNF-α is also severely impaired in Tpl2–/– macrophages and that the ERK activation signals are induced by triggering the p55 TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) (12Eliopoulos A.G. Wang C.C. Dumitru C.D. Tsichlis P.N. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3855-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts isolated from Tpl2–/– mice demonstrate additional defects in NF-κB transactivation and JNK signal transduction in response to TNF stimulation (13Das S. Cho J. Lambertz I. Kelliher M.

Taken together, these findings may provide an explanation to the reported protection of Tpl2 knock-out mice from TNF-α-induced inflammatory bowel disease (14Kontoyiannis D. Boulougouris G. Manoloukos M. Armaka M. Apostolaki M. Pizarro T. Kotlyarov A. Forster I. Flavell R. Gaestel M. Tsichlis P. Cominelli F. Kollias G. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1563-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Tpl2 is regulated by and contributes to the transduction of pro-inflammatory signals is currently the subject of intense investigation. Previous studies demonstrated that Tpl2 forms a stoichiometric, high affinity complex with the cytoplasmic NF-κB inhibitory protein p105 NF-κB1 (15Belich M.P. Salmeron A. Johnston L.H. Ley S.C. Nature. 1999; 397: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and that the Tpl2:NF-κB1 binding stabilizes but inactivates Tpl2. LPS and TNF signals promote the dissociation of Tpl2 from p105 (16Waterfield M.R. Zhang M. Norman L.P. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 685-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Unbound Tpl2 is active but unstable and undergoes rapid degradation via the proteasome (16Waterfield M.R. Zhang M. Norman L.P. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 685-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). As expected, the steady-state levels of Tpl2 are very low in NF-κB1–/– macrophages, and the ability of LPS to activate ERK and its downstream target cyclooxygenase-2 is severely impaired in these cells (16Waterfield M.R. Zhang M. Norman L.P. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 685-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Although not fully defined, this regulatory event occurs downstream of the IκB kinase (IKK) signaling complex that is responsible for the stimulus-dependent serine phosphorylation of NF-κB1 and its subsequent degradation by the proteasome (17Heissmeyer V. Krappmann D. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4766-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Indeed, the inactivation of the IKKβ catalytic subunit of the IKK signaling complex results not only in impaired NF-κB signaling but also in diminished activation of Tpl2 and ERK in response to TNF-α or LPS (18Waterfield M. Jin W. Reiley W. Zhang M. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6040-6048Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 19Beinke S. Robinson M.J. Hugunin M. Ley S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9658-9667Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). IKKβ is also required for the direct phosphorylation of Tpl2 at Thr290, which regulates Tpl2 binding to NF-κB1 (20Cho J. Tsichlis P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2350-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 21Cho J. Melnick M. Solidakis G.P. Tsichlis P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20442-20448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, although IKKβ and NF-κB1 are required for the activation of Tpl2, additional molecules that regulate Tpl2 are likely to exist. Thus, a role for protein-tyrosine kinases in Tpl2 signaling has been recently highlighted by the inhibitory effects of the broad spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin-A on LPS-induced Tpl2 activation (22Caivano M. Rodriguez C. Cohen P. Alemany S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52124-52130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The binding of soluble TNF-α to TNFR1 induces the recruitment of receptor-interacting protein-1 (RIP1) and TNF receptor-associated factor-2 (TRAF2) to the cytoplasmic C terminus of TNFR1 (23Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.-B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar), which results in the transduction of signals that regulate the MAPK pathways and NF-κB (24Kelliher M.A. Grimm S.

In the present study, we focused on the mechanisms of Tpl2 activation by TNF-α, upstream of ERK. Our data demonstrate that Tpl2 plays an important role in the TNF-α-mediated activation of MEK and ERK across different cell lineages. In addition, our data show that RIP1 and TRAF2 associate with Tpl2 and that their expression is necessary but not sufficient for the transduction of Tpl2 activation signals engaged by TNF-α. Finally, we provide biochemical and genetic data that demonstrate that the activation of the Tpl2/MEK/ERK cascade by TNF-α depends on the tyrosine kinase Syk. Cell Culture and Transfections—Cell culture, transfections, and reporter assays were performed as described previously (10Dumitru C.D. Ceci J.D. Tsatsanis C. Kontoyiannis D. Stamatakis K. Lin J.H.

H33HJ-JA1 and Jurkat E6.1 cells were purchased from European Collection of Animal Cell Culture and maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). HeLa and MCF7 cells were obtained from the Cancer Research UK Cell Culture facility, London, UK, and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Macrophage and fibroblast cultures were performed as described previously (12Eliopoulos A.G. Wang C.C. Dumitru C.D. Tsichlis P.N. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3855-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Chemical inhibitors (LY, BisI, PP2, PP3, Pic, and HerbA) were purchased from Calbiochem and dissolved in Me2SO prior to use. A Myc-tagged Syk expression vector was kindly provided by Professor Steve Watson, University of Birmingham, UK. Immunocomplex Kinase Assays—To assay Tpl2 kinase activity, 400–600 μg of whole cell lysate was immunoprecipitated for 4–5 h with anti-Tpl2 antibody M20 coupled to protein-A-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or unconjugated protein-A beads as a control. Bound proteins were washed twice with kinase lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.5% Triton X-100, 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EGTA, 3 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm DTT) and twice with kinase reaction buffer (KRB: 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm DTT). The beads were resuspended in 20 μl of KRB containing 200 μm ATP, 22 mm MgCl2, 0.4 μg of inactive GST-MEK1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), and 1 μg of inactive GST-ERK2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Following incubation for 30 min at 30 °C in a shaking incubator, the beads were pellet by centrifugation, and 6 μl of the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube together with 10 μl of KRB, 10 μl of MBP (Invitrogen) substrate (2 mg/ml stock in KRB), and 10 μl of diluted [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in KRB containing 500 μm ATP and 75 mm MgCl2). The reaction was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in a shaking incubator, and 10 μl were spotted on a 2 × 2-cm P81 paper square (Whatman) in duplicate or triplicate. The squares were washed three times with 0.75% phosphoric acid for 5 min per wash, once with acetone for 5 min, and then left to dry. The [γ-32P]ATP that was incorporated to MBP was measured in a scintillation counter, and specific activity was calculated. Immunocomplex JNK and ERK in vitro kinase assays using GST-c-Jun (Cell Signaling Technology) and GST-Elk1 (Cell Signaling Technology) as substrates, respectively, were performed as described previously (12Eliopoulos A.G. Wang C.C. Dumitru C.D. Tsichlis P.N. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3855-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 29Eliopoulos A.G. Waites E.R. Blake S.M. Davies C. Murray P. Young L.S. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 1316-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For IKK kinase assays, cells were lysed in kinase lysis buffer and cleared by centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 10 min). 500 μg of the lysates were then immunoprecipitated with 1.2 μg of the anti-IKKβ mAb H4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein-G beads for 3 h. Bound proteins were washed twice with kinase lysis buffer and twice with IKK kinase reaction buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate), and the kinase reaction was performed in 20 μl of reaction buffer containing 10 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 1 μg of GST-IκBα (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) for 30 min at 30 °C in a shaking incubator. 20 μl of SDS-gel loading buffer was then added to terminate the reaction, and the products were resolved on a 10% gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and exposed to autoradiography. The membrane was then incubated with anti-IKKβ polyclonal antibody H470 to confirm similar levels of immunoprecipitated IKK. Activation of Syk was measured by autophosphorylation assays, as described previously (30Avdi N.J. Nick J.A. Whitlock B.B. Billstrom M.A. Henson P.M. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2189-2199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Briefly, anti-Syk immunoprecipitates were washed once in kinase lysis buffer and three times with Syk kinase reaction buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2). The kinase reaction was performed in 30 μl of reaction buffer containing 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 10 min at 30 °C in a shaking incubator. 20 μl of SDS gel loading buffer was then added to terminate the reaction, and the products were resolved on a 9% gel, which was dried and exposed to autoradiography. Antibodies, Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitations—Antibodies to phosphorylated IκBa, MEK, ERK, Syk, and p38 and “total” ERK and p38 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies and used in immunoblotting at 1:1000 dilution. Msk1, p50/NF-κB1, Akt, Syk 4D10 mAb, and phosphotyrosine 4G10 antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Polyclonal antibodies against IκBα, p65, TRAF2, and Syk were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Agarose and HRP-conjugated anti-Tpl2 polyclonal antibody M20 was also obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For immunoprecipitations in 293 cells, 500 μg of cell extracts were incubated overnight with 2 μg of anti-RIP1 antibody (Pharmingen), and the precipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblot. Syk was immunoprecipitated from 400 μg of total cell lysates using 1 μg of anti-Syk C-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 4D10 antibody and immunoblotted with 4G10 mAb. For detection of NF-κB1/Tpl2 interactions, a goat polyclonal NF-κB1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was first coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads using dimethyl pimelimidate. The coupled antibody was then incubated with 2 mg of protein extracts overnight, and immunoprecipitated NF-κB1 was immunoblotted with either HRP-conjugated Tpl2 or a rabbit polyclonal anti-NF-κB1 (Upstate). A similar approach was used to detect endogenous TNFR1/Syk interactions in TNF-α-stimulated macrophages, using an anti-TNFR1 antibody fromR&D Systems. RNA Interference—For delivery of small interfering RNAs (siRNA), 1 × 105 MCF7 cells were plated in each well of a 24-well plate (Costar), and the next day siRNA duplexes were transfected using the siIMPORTER transfection reagent (Upstate Biotechnology), according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Syk was targeted with the Syk siRNA duplexes GUCGAGCAUUAUUCUUAUAdTdT (and its antisense) and CCUCAUCAGGGAAUAUGUG (and its antisense). As a control, the firefly luciferase siRNA duplex CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGAdTdT (and antisense) was used. All siRNAs were synthesized by MWG Biotec, Ebersberg, Germany. Following a 6-h incubation with Syk or luciferase siRNA duplexes, an equal volume of media was added. Cells were then left to recover for 10 h and were re-plated in 24-well dishes. The next day, the cells were subjected to a second round of transfection to increase the siRNA-mediated gene suppression. Twenty four hours later, cultures were serum-starved overnight and then stimulated with TNF-α, before lysis. Tpl2 Is Largely Responsible for the Engagement of the MEK/ERK Pathway by TNF-α—The role of Tpl2 in TNF-induced ERK signaling was first examined in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) isolated from the Tpl2+/+ and Tpl2–/– mice. Cell cultures were stimulated with human TNF-α, which selectively engages the mouse TNFR1. Western blots of cell lysates harvested at sequential time points were probed with antibodies against the phosphorylated and active forms of ERK1 and ERK2, the total (phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated) ERK, and the phosphorylated form of the ERK kinase MEK. The results confirmed our previous finding that the TNF-α-mediated ERK phosphorylation is severely impaired, although not abolished, in Tpl2–/– BMDM (12Eliopoulos A.G. Wang C.C. Dumitru C.D. Tsichlis P.N. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3855-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Moreover, the results of the present analysis extend this finding by the demonstration that MEK phosphorylation is also significantly reduced in TNF-α stimulated Tpl2–/– BMDM (Fig. 1A). Therefore, Tpl2 functions upstream of MEK in the molecular pathway that is initiated by TNFR1 and results in the phosphorylation of ERK. To confirm that the effect of Tpl2 on TNF-induced ERK signaling is not a macrophage-restricted phenomenon, we performed similar analysis in immortalized Tpl2+/+ and Tpl2–/– fibroblasts. The results showed diminished ERK phosphorylation in TNF-stimulated Tpl2–/– fibroblasts (Fig. 1B). Similarly, the TNF-mediated activation of ERK, as measured by in vitro kinase assays using GST-Elk1 as a substrate, was significantly reduced in MCF7 breast carcinoma cells transfected with low amounts of Tpl2KM, a catalytically inactive Tpl2 (Fig. 1C). Therefore, Tpl2 Tp12KM, a plays an important role in TNF-induced ERK signaling in a range of different cell types. However, additional Tpl2-independent mechanisms of ERK signaling are also engaged by TNF stimulation. RIP1 and TRAF2 Are Necessary for the Activation of the Tpl2/ERK Cascade in Response to TNF-α Stimulation—However, RIP1 or TRAF2 overexpression is not sufficient for ERK activation. In an effort to characterize the pathway through which Tpl2 regulates TNFR1-transduced ERK activation signals, we first examined whether Tpl2 is recruited to a RIP1-containing complex in TNF-stimulated cells. To this end, endogenous RIP1 was immunoprecipitated from Tpl2+/+ macrophages before, and 2.5 and 5 min after stimulation with TNF-α. Immunoprecipitates were then immunoblotted with either an HRP-conjugated Tpl2 antibody or with anti-RIP1. The results showed weak association of RIP1 and Tpl2 in unstimulated cultures, which was significantly increased following treatment with TNF-α (Fig. 2A). The ability of Tpl2 to complex with RIP1 was confirmed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells transiently transfected with Myc-tagged Tpl2 or, as a negative control, FLAG-tagged Msk1. RIP1 immunoprecipitates from these cultures were immunoblotted with anti-Tpl2, Msk1, or RIP1 antibodies. It was found that overexpressed Tpl2, but not Msk1, associates with endogenous RIP1 (Fig. 2B). Similar experiments were performed in cells transfected with Myc-tagged NF-κB1, a Tpl2-interacting protein. The results showed that endogenous RIP1 associated with NF-κB1 (Fig. 2C). RIP1 also interacts with TRAF2 following stimulation with TNF-α (23Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.-B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 25Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Kelliher M. Liu Z. Immunity. 2000; 12: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). TRAF2 co-immunoprecipitates with overexpressed Tpl2 (28Eliopoulos A.G. Davies C. Blake S.S. Murray P. Najafipour S. Tsichlis P.N. Young L.S. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4567-4579Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), but the physiological role of TRAF2 in TNF-induced Tpl2/MEK/ERK signaling is unknown. This issue was addressed in fibroblasts isolated from TRAF2+/+ and TRAF2–/– mice (Fig. 2D). Examination of the effects of TNF on ERK phosphorylation in TRAF2+/+ fibroblasts demonstrated significant activation of ERK at 10 and 20 min, which returned to basal levels by 30 min of treatment (Fig. 2E). Most interestingly, the activation of ERK in TRAF2–/– cells was reduced at 10 min and was abolished at 20 min of stimulation with TNF-α (Fig. 2E). Therefore, TRAF2 plays an important role in TNFR1-transduced ERK activation signals. This observation raised the question of whether TRAF2 is required for Tpl2 activation in response to TNF-α. To this end, TRAF2+/+ and TRAF2–/– fibroblasts were treated with TNF-α for 10 or 20 min or left untreated, and lysates from these cultures were immunoprecipitated with anti-Tpl2 antibody and subjected to an in vitro coupled kinase assay using inactive MEK, ERK2, and MBP as sequential substrates. The results showed significant increase in the endogenous Tpl2 kinase activity in TNF-stimulated TRAF2+/+ fibroblasts, which was absent in TRAF2–/– cells (Fig. 2F). We conclude that TRAF2 is required for TNFR1 signaling on the Tpl2/MEK/ERK axis. Overexpression of RIP1 or TRAF2 activates the JNK, p38, and NF-κB pathways (31Reinhard C. Shamoon B. Shyamala V. Williams L.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1080-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 32Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V.

Science. 1997; 275: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). To determine whether overexpression of TRAF2 and RIP1 also results in the activation of the Tpl2/MEK/ERK pathway, HEK293 cells were first transfected with RIP1, and its effects on the endogenous ERK2 activation were examined by in vitro kinase assays using GST-Elk1 as a substrate. As a control, the effects of transfected RIP1 on JNK1 activation were also assessed by in vitro kinase assays using GST-c-Jun as a substrate. RIP1 overexpression was found to increase the kinase activity of endogenous JNK1 but not ERK2 (Fig. 3, A and B). Unlike RIP1, Tpl2 overexpression potently induced the activation of both ERK2 and JNK1 (Fig. 3, A and B). Similar results were obtained when the phosphorylation status of transfected HA-ERK1 or HA-JNK1 was examined in RIP1 overexpressing HEK293 cells (data not shown). We next examined the effects of TRAF2 on the activation of the Tpl2/MEK/ERK pathway. To this end, HEK293 cells were transfected with empty vector (Fig. 3C, 1st 4 lanes), TRAF2 (5th lane) or, as a control, Tpl2 (6th lane), and they were either left untreated (1st, 5th, and 6th lanes) or stimulated with TNF-α for 10, 20, or 30 min (Fig. 3C, 2nd to 4th lanes). Endogenous ERK2 or, as a control, JNK1 was immunoprecipitated and examined for catalytic activity using GST-Elk1 or GST-c-Jun as a substrate, respectively. The results showed that expression of TRAF2 induced an ∼2.2-fold increase in activation of JNK but failed to activate the endogenous ERK in these cells. However, transfection of Tpl2 or treatment with TNF-α engaged both signaling pathways (Fig. 3C). Similar results were obtained upon co-transfection of TRAF2 and HA-ERK1 (Fig. 3D), suggesting that the inability of TRAF2 to activate ERK is not merely a consequence of insufficient expression levels of TRAF2 versus ERK. The effects of TRAF2 on the kinase activity of Tpl2 was also determined. Although TNF stimulation significantly increased the catalytic activity of Tpl2 in a time-dependent manner, transfection of TRAF2 had no effect (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these data suggest that the expression of RIP1 and TRAF2 is necessary but not sufficient for the activation of the Tpl2/ERK cascade in response to TNF-α stimulation. The Syk Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Piceatannol Suppresses the TNF-mediated Activation of the Tpl2/MEK/ERK Pathway—On the basis of the preceding data, we hypothesized that activation of Tpl2, following its recruitment to the TNFR1-RIP1-TRAF2 complex, requires additional TNF-induced signals. Previous studies had shown that tyrosine kinase signaling may play an important role in Tpl2/MAPK activation by LPS in RAW264.7 macrophages (22Caivano M. Rodriguez C. Cohen P. Alemany S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52124-52130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To determine whether tyrosine kinases are also required for the activation of Tpl2 by TNF-α in BMDM, we treated these cells with the broad spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin-A (HerbA), prior to stimulation with TNF-α, and we analyzed their lysates for the expression and phosphorylation of MEK and ERK. The results showed a dramatic reduction in both MEK and ERK activation in TNF-α-stimulated macrophages pretreated with HerbA, compared with cells exposed to TNF-α alone (Fig. 4A). On the basis of this observation, we proceeded to evaluate the effects of chemical inhibitors that target specific tyrosine kinases. To this end, Tpl2+/+ macrophages were treated with the Syk tyrosine kinase inhibitor piceatannol (Pic) (34Oliver J.M. Burg D.L. Wilson B.S. McLaughlin J.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 2005; 142: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), but the role of the embryonic cell transcriptome in this context remains to be established. Here, we extended our previous investigation to analyze additional pluripotent cell-specific genes for their predisposition to retrotransposition. In addition, we screened a panel of 24 adult human tissues to reveal transcriptional activity of these novel processed retrogenes. We report that one of the Dppa3-derived genomic sequences is transcriptionally active and displays a tissue-specific expression profile.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBLAST was used to compare the cDNA of Nanog, Oct4, Dppa3 (Stella/PGC7), GDF3, and Dppa1, -2, -4, and -5 with the National Center for Biotechnology Information human genome data base (18Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69138) Google Scholar). An E value limit was set to 1 × 10–4 for these searches, and the Ensembl genome browser was used to confirm all blast hits. Processed pseudogenes were selected based on the search criteria, which calculated similarity to the source genes in question.Pseudogene sequences were compared with their corresponding source gene sequence and variations were exploited to design specific primers to each retropseudogene using Vector NTI Suite 9. All of the primers associated with one source gene were cross-checked with its source gene and all of its sister pseudogenes to confirm specificity. Primers were purchased from Sigma Genosys and resuspended to 1 μl/μg in ddH20 and then diluted 200-fold in ddH20. PCR against the human genome was performed using PCR SuperMix (Invitrogen).Human rapid scan panels were purchased from OriGene Technologies. The panels contained 96 wells consisting of 24 tissues arrayed in quadruplicate. Each quadruplicate consisted of increasing concentrations of cDNA (1×, 10×, 100×, and 1000×). PCR using source- and retropseudogene-specific primers along with PCR SuperMix was carried out against these panels. In all panels screened in this study, β-actin was amplified to validate the integrity of the cDNA samples.RNA was prepared from donor-derived human blood and bone marrow (Cambrex) using RNeasy kits (Qiagen). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using the SuperScript III RT kit (Invitrogen). PCR was carried out using source and retropseudogene primers as well as PCR SuperMix. β-Actin was employed as a control to validate the integrity of each sample.Pancreas cDNA was obtained from BioChain, and RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) cDNA was purchased from Ambion. cDNAs isolated from thyroid gland, heart and adrenal gland were obtained from BioChain.Each reaction well contained 5 μl of forward primer, 5 μl of reverse primer, 1 μl of genomic DNA, and 39 μl of PCR SuperMix (Invitrogen). These samples were run at 94 °C (5 min), then through 35 cycles of the following three steps (1) 94 °C (1 min), (2) 55 °C (1 min), (3) 72 °C (1 min), and finally at 72 °C (5 min) followed by refrigeration. Annealing temperatures of 50 and 60 °C were also attempted for each primer pair. PCR products were then run on agarose gels, treated with ethidium bromide, and imaged. For the rapid scan screens, 5 μlof forward primer, 5 μl of reverse primer, and 39 μl of PCR SuperMix (Invitrogen) was added to each well on the cDNA panels. PCR and electrophoresis were carried out as detailed above.RESULTSPreviously, we BLASTed four known pluripotent cell-specific mRNA transcripts against the human genome and revealed their predisposition for retrotransposition and subsequent generation of processed pseudogenes (4Pain D. Chirn G.W. Strassel C. Kemp D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6265-6268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The frequency of retrotransposition within the “pluripotent gene” set was striking, compared with that of non-pluripotent cell-specific genes. In summary, three of the four stem cell-specific genes contributed to a total of 32 processed pseudogenes, whereas 15 non-stem cell-specific genes contributed to a single processed pseudogene.In the current study, we shifted focus to a different set of recently identified pluripotent tissue-specific genes. The Dppa family of genes (Dppa1–5) are coordinately expressed in pluripotent tissues, including blastocyst, epiblast, and primordial germ cells (11Bortvin A. Eggan K. Skaletsky H. Akutsu H. Berry D.L. Yanagimachi R. Page D.C. Jaenisch R. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 1673-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). We observed by BLAST analysis that four of the five Dppa genes possess multiple, highly conserved retropseudogenes, dispersed throughout the human genome (Table 1). Briefly, mRNA transcript sequences of these genes were individually BLASTed against the National Center for Biotechnology Information human genome data base. The hits that represented the source genes contained the expected intron/exon gene organization, but all other sequences were contiguous, such that the conserved alignments reflected the mRNA transcript sequence rather than the genomic sequence. This suggested that these conserved sequences likely resulted from retrotransposition events (19Devor E.J. Moffat-Wilson K.A. Hum. Biol. 2003; 75: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the instances of Dppa1 and Dppa5, the mouse ortholog was used as source gene in the absence of an annotated human variant. However, these murine transcripts were BLASTed against the human genome. MEGABLAST was employed with an expected value significance cut-off equal to 0.01, and this relatively high stringency was used to predict the occurrence of gene retrotransposition. Due to this relative increase in stringency compared with our previous study, Dppa3 (Stella/Pgc7) associated with five less hits, totaling 11 (4Pain D. Chirn G.W. Strassel C. Kemp D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6265-6268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In total, four of the five Dppa genes were associated with 22 processed pseudogenes by this bioinformatic analysis. In summary, these data further consolidate our previous observation of apparent predisposition of pluripotent cell-specific genes to the generation of processed pseudogenes (38 from 8 ES cell-specific source genes, see Table 1).TABLE 1MEGABLAST analysis of pluripotent cell-specific gene mRNA sequences against the human genomeGeneSource gene (species)Human genome locusFrequency of retropseudogenesDppa1MouseNAaNA, not available.0Dppa2Human3q135Dppa3Human12p1311Dppa4Human3q134Dppa5MouseNA2NanogHuman12p1310Oct4Human6p216Gdf3Human12p130a NA, not available. Open table in a new tab Dppa3 (Stella/Pgc7) was associated with 11 processed pseudogenes, annotated Dppa3 (a–k) (Table 2). A non-extensive bioinformatic analysis was performed on each putative pseudogene to predict the likelihood of transcriptional activity. Start and stop codons conserved from the source gene represented a potential identifier, as did conservation of the full coding region (Table 2). Following this analysis, four processed pseudogenes of Dppa3 were selected to further characterize their functional potential (i.e. Dppa3 (a–d)).TABLE 2Characterization of Dppa3 retropseudogenesPseudogeneHuman genome locusCoding regionStart codonStop codonLocation commentDppa3(a)Xq22FullYesYesDppa3(b)14q13FullYesYesDppa3(c)12q22FullYesYesIntron (LOC387873)Dppa3(d)16p13FullYesYesIntron (CREB-BP)Dppa3(e)3p21FullYesYesIntron (Vpr-bindingprotein)Dppa3(f)9p13IncompleteNoYesDppa3(g)8q21FullYesYesDppa3(h)8q24FullYesNoDppa3(i)5p14FullYesNoDppa3(j)3q28IncompleteNoNoDppa3(k)9q31IncompleteNoYesIntron (Inversin) Open table in a new tab To selectively identify processed pseudogenes of Dppa3, specific PCR primers were designed to mismatch with other pseudogenes as well as the source gene (Table 3).

Notably, the Dppa3 source gene primer pair failed to generate an amplification product in any of the adult tissues tested (data not shown), confirming the reported specificity of Dppa3 expression in pluripotent tissues (11Bortvin A. Eggan K. Skaletsky H. Akutsu H. Berry D.L. Yanagimachi R. Page D.C. Jaenisch R. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 1673-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). In contrast, RT-PCR against Dppa3(d) generated amplification products of the predicted size. Transcripts for Dppa3(d) were detected in bone marrow, peripheral blood, adrenal gland, pancreas, and thyroid (thyroid not clearly seen in Fig. 1). In each case, the amplified product was only detected in the 1000x cDNA reaction, due to the low expression level of the transcript in all positive tissue types.To validate the expression of Dppa3(d) in these specific tissues, we obtained human RNA from alternative sources, from which to perform RT-PCR with the putative pseudogene-selective primers. Human bone marrow-derived RNA was extracted from mononuclear cells that were isolated from donated whole bone marrow aspirates. Peripheral blood was similarly donated by volunteers, from which mononuclear cells were isolated and prepared for RNA extraction. Other human tissues were acquired from various vendors (see Mateials and Methods) and RT-PCR was performed on all samples simultaneously (Fig. 2). Amplification of the Dppa3(d) product was successful in all of the re-tested adult tissue-types, confirming the data from the primary tissue panel screens. Importantly, the Dppa3 source gene primers were unable to amplify any product within these tissue samples, consistent with the reported absence of Dppa3 source gene transcript in human adult tissues (Fig. 2). The variation in amplification product intensity within this panel of tissues may be explained by the variety in sample source, cell-type homogeneity, as well as the non-quantitative nature of gel-based RT-PCR.FIGURE 2Tissue-specific expression of Dppa3(d). RT-PCR was carried out using primers specific for β-actin, Dppa3(d), or the source gene Dppa3. Adult tissue extracts included: adrenal gland (lane 1), bone marrow (lane 2), heart (lane 3), pancreas (lane 4), peripheral blood (lane 5), and thyroid gland (lane 6). Lane L represents the 100-bp ladder control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm that the Dppa3(d) primers were not selective for the source Dppa3 gene-derived transcript, and that the primers for the source gene were legitimate, RT-PCR was performed on NT2 cell-derived RNA (a teratocarcinoma cell line). This cell line expresses Nanog and Oct4, and differentiates preferentially to neuronal lineages upon retinoic acid treatment (20Deb-Rinker P. Ly D. Jezierski A. Sikorska M. Walker P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6257-6260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The Dppa3(d) primers failed to generate any product from NT2 cell RNA, whereas in bone marrow and pancreas (obtained from alternative sources to previous figures, see “Experimental Procedures”), robust transcripts were amplified under the same PCR conditions (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the Dppa3 source gene primer pair successfully amplified a product of the expected size from NT2 cell RNA, confirming expression of Dppa3 coordinate with the pluripotency-related genes Nanog and Oct4 (Fig. 3B). However, no amplification product was observed from bone marrow or pancreas cDNA using the source gene primers. Notably, in a single experiment, we did observe very weak positive amplification of Dppa3 source gene transcript in the bone marrow-derived mRNA (data not shown). To validate these data further, we sequenced the RT-PCR products and confirmed that the primers were exclusively amplifying the Dppa3 source gene or the Dppa3(d) gene as predicted in the various tissues and cell lines (Table 4).FIGURE 3Specificity of Dppa3 source gene primers.

Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONGerm line transmission is a prerequisite for genes that give rise to processed pseudogenes, and elevated source gene transcription levels further promote such events (21Zhang Z. Gerstein M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 328-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This primary feature of inherited retrotransposition inspired us to focus on pluripotent cell-specific genes as a potential source of processed pseudogenes in the human genome. Previously, we proposed a role of extensive retrotransposition as a potential signature event of ES cell-specific genes (4Pain D. Chirn G.W. Strassel C. Kemp D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6265-6268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We found that Nanog, Oct4, and Dppa3 (Stella/PGC7) each possess multiple processed pseudogenes, and our data suggested that retrotransposition frequency of ES cell-specific genes far exceeds that of non-ES cell-specific genes. Moreover, we proposed that this “pseudogene signature” may prove useful in identifying novel ES cell-specific genes in future. On this basis, we continued to develop the hypothesis to assess whether any of the ES cell-specific (or pluripotent cell-specific) genes were retrotransposed to form transcriptionally active genomic integrants. First, we identified further examples of processed pseudogenes originating from pluripotent cell-specific genes. The Dppa family of genes were identified as a cluster of genes whose developmental expression pattern was similar to that of Oct4 (11Bortvin A. Eggan K. Skaletsky H. Akutsu H. Berry D.L. Yanagimachi R. Page D.C. Jaenisch R. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 1673-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Like Oct4, this cluster of genes also appeared predisposed to the generation of processed pseudogenes, consistent with the original tenet of the study. Next, we progressed to the question of whether any of the putative pluripotency gene-related retropseudogenes were transcriptionally active. We hypothesized that the creation of functionally active products of retrotransposition that originated from pluripotency-related genes may indicate far reaching implications in evolution.Here, we reveal that retrotransposition of the pluripotent tissue-specific Dppa3 gene created a transcriptionally active daughter genomic sequence, which displays a discrete tissue-specific expression pattern. The functional role (if any) of this descendant transcript remains to be elucidated. As for precedent, the reported functional manifestations of other transcribed retrogenes include protein expression (22Bellingham J. Tarttelin E.E. Foster R.G. Wells D.J. J. Exp. Zool. B Mol. Dev. Evol. 2003; 297: 1-10PubMed Google Scholar) as well as regulatory mechanisms mediated by duplex mRNA formation with parent transcripts that impart inhibitory (23Korneev S.A. Park J.H. O'Shea M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7711-7720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or stabilizing effects (24Hirotsune S. Yoshida N. Chen A. Garrett L. Sugiyama F. Takahashi S. Yagami K. Wynshaw-Boris A. Yoshiki A. Nature. 2003; 423: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). However, as the tissue distribution of Dppa3(d) transcript is distinct from its source gene, a role in mRNA duplexing is unlikely. Furthermore, recent studies investigating the multipotency of adult tissue-derived cells have utilized RT-PCR detection of Dppa3, Oct4, and Nanog gene transcripts as markers of pluripotency (25Johnson J. Bagley J. Skaznik-Wikiel M. Lee H.J. Adams G.B. Niikura Y. Tschudy K.S. Tilly J.C. Cortes M.L. Forkert R. Spitzer T. Iacomini J. Scadden D.T. Tilly J.L. Cell. 2005; 122: 303-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Given our present finding that a Dppa3-derived retrogene is expressed in bone marrow, it may be prudent to readdress the use of these pluripotency genes in this context. Moreover, further studies should reveal which specific cell types within bone marrow, peripheral blood, pancreas, thyroid, and adrenal gland express the Dppa3(d) retrogene, and these ongoing efforts will likely expedite its functional characterization.Given the increased propensity for highly expressed genes within the germ line to propogate new, functional DNA, a clear advantage is provided for ES cell-specific genes or other pluripotency-related genes to promote genetic diversity and play a key evolutionary role. Whether this is the case for the Dppa3-derived retrogene, Dppa3(d), is tempting to speculate, but clarification will require further study. Processed pseudogenes (retropseudogenes) emerge by reverse transcription of processed mRNA and consequent genomic integration (1Vanin E.F. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1985; 19: 253-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 2Balakirev E.S. Ayala F.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2003; 37: 123-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 3Goncalves I. Duret L.

Induction of DNA replication by LIF or prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) occurs, in part, through different signaling events. LIF and OSM specifically trigger STAT1 cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation, whereas PGF2α fails to do so. However, LIF and PGF2α can trigger increases in ERK1/2 activity, which are required for their mitogenic responses because U0126, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, prevents both ERK1/2 activation and induction of DNA synthesis by LIF or PGF2α treatment. PGF2α induces cyclin D expression and full phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein. In contrast, LIF fails to promote increases in cyclin D mRNA/protein levels; consequently, LIF induces DNA synthesis without promoting full phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (Rb). However, both LIF and PGF2α increase cyclin E expression. Furthermore, LIF mitogenic action does not involve protein kinase C (PKC) activation, because a PKC inhibitor does not block this effect. In contrast, PKC activity is required for PGF2α mitogenic action. More importantly, the synergistic effect between LIF and PGF2α to promote S phase entry is independent of PKC activation. These results show fundamental differences between LIF- and PGF2α-dependent mechanism(s) that induce cellular entry into S phase.

However, because these mitogens have been tested in different cellular systems, it is unknown whether this difference is a function of the cell type or is a fundamental difference in the delivery of the transducing signal per se. Thus, we have systematically studied LIF-, OSM-, and PGF2α-dependent mechanisms of control of S phase entry into the Swiss 3T3 cell system. We have shown previously that LIF-triggered signals differ from those triggered by classical mitogens, such as PGF2α, bombesin, or epidermal growth factor (30Jiménez de Asúa L. Goin M.

LIF and OSM trigger initiation of DNA synthesis without the requirement for mevalonic acid synthesis because inhibition of the hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase by lovostatin does not block LIF- or OSM-induced DNA replication and cell multiplication (32Sauane M. Coso O.A. Giulianelli S. Giráldez A.N. Rudland P.S. Jimenez de Asúa L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 313: 926-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Indeed, because LIF triggers cellular entry into the S phase via a PKC-independent signaling mechanism, it becomes relevant to investigate which activation cascade (MAPK and/or JAK/STAT) is involved in the onset of DNA replication and cell division. Here we show that LIF and OSM stimulate the initiation of DNA synthesis and cell division through a common signaling mechanism that involves MEK/ERK activation as well as STAT1 cytoplasmic-nuclear translocation. Signals triggered by LIF and OSM are independent of PKC activation. On the other hand, PGF2α triggers activation of MEK/ERK but fails to activate STAT1 cytoplasmic-nuclear translocation. The different signaling pathways involved in the mitogenic response to cytokines and growth factors cause a major effect on G1 cyclin expression. PGF2α, as the majority of classical growth factors, induces the expression of cyclin Ds as an important step in the G0 to S phase transition. However, LIF-stimulated S phase entry occurs without changes in the levels of cyclin Ds but with increases in cyclin E expression. These findings are relevant for understanding how LIF, in particular, and cytokines, in general, regulate the events involved in controlling the normal cell cycle. These studies are also important for unraveling critical signaling events capable of underlying unrestricted cancerous cell division. Chemicals—The majority of the materials was purchased from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. The mouse recombinant carrier-free LIF, OSM, CNTF, and IL-6 were purchased from R & D (Minneapolis, MN). PGF2α was the generous gift from Dr. M. Torkelston, Upjohn (Kalamazoo, MI), and the GF109203X was kindly provided by GlaxoSmithKline. U0126 was purchased from Calbiochem. [methyl-3H]Thymidine was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Cell Culture—Swiss mouse 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units of penicillin/ml, 100 μg of streptomycin/ml, and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Subconfluent cultures were grown in 100-mm dishes at 37 °C equilibrated with 10% (v/v) CO2. Initiation of DNA Synthesis Assay—Cells were seeded at 1.5 × 105 in 35-mm dishes in 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with low molecular weight nutrients (DEMS), 1% (v/v) newborn calf serum, and 6% (v/v) fetal calf serum. After 3 days of incubation, the medium was changed to a similar fresh medium, and the cells were further incubated for 3–4 days to allow them to become confluent and quiescent. Cytokines and growth factors were directly added to the conditioned medium. Cells were then labeled with [methyl-3H]thymidine for 28 h before being processed for autoradiography. The percentage of cells that initiated DNA synthesis at a given time was determined as described previously (25Levy C.S. Sauane M. Rudland P.S. Jiménez de Asúa L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cell Number—Cells were plated at 1.5 × 105 in 60-mm dishes in 5 ml of medium, for the determination of the initiation of DNA synthesis. When cells became quiescent, but were still subconfluent, the corresponding cytokines or prostaglandins were added to the culture medium, and the cell number was determined 60 h later. Cells were detached from the dish using 5 mm EDTA, 0.05% (v/v) trypsin for 5 min at 37 °C and counted in a Coulter counter (34Otto A.M. Nilsen-Hamilton M. Boss B.D. Ulrich M.O. Jiménez de Asúa L.

MAPK Assay—MAPK activity assays were performed on subconfluent Swiss 3T3 cells by immunoprecipitation of total endogenous ERK. Cells were maintained for 16 h in serum-free medium and then treated with agents as indicated in the figure legends, washed with cold PBS, and lysed at 4 °C in a buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.3 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (v/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (v/v) SDS, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin. ERK was immunoprecipitated from the cleared lysates by incubation with the specific antibody (sc-154 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were recovered with the aid of Gamma-bind-Sepharose Beads (Amersham Biosciences) and washed three times with PBS containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and 2 mm Na3VO4, once with 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 m LiCl, and once in kinase reaction buffer (12.5 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), 12.5 mm 3-glycerophosphate, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm sodium fluoride, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate). The ERK-2 activity present in the immunoprecipitates was determined by resuspension in 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP per reaction and 20 μm of unlabeled ATP, using 20 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP) as a substrate, as described previously (35Coso O.A.

After 20 min at 30 °C, reactions were terminated by addition of 10 μl of 5× Laemmli buffer. Samples were heated 5 min at 95 °C and analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis on 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels. Autoradiography was performed with the aid of an intensifying screen. Parallel immunoprecipitates were processed for Western blot analysis using the same antiserum as described previously (35Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Kalinec G. Kyriakis J.M. Woodgett J. Gutkind J.S. J.

Indirect Immunofluorescence—It was performed on sparse quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells, adhering to coverslips. After stimulation, cells were fixed and permeabilized with 3.7% (v/v) formaldehyde in PBS plus 0.2%(v/v) saponin for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then blocked for 30 min with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated goat serum and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with 20 μg/ml of the primary antibody diluted in PBS, 0.1%(v/v) saponin. The primaries antibodies used were as follows: STAT1 antibody (G16920), STAT3 antibody (S21320), and STAT5 antibody (S21520) from BD Transduction Laboratories. The coverslips were washed three times with PBS and further incubated for 1 h with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgGs (Sigma) diluted 1/50 in PBS. Finally the cells were washed three times with PBS and mounted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.3]octane solution (Sigma). Images were obtained on a BX-60 Olympus fluorescent microscope. The percentage of cells in which STAT1 translocated to the nucleus upon LIF or LIF plus Na3VO4 treatment was determined in three independent experiments by counting the number of nuclear and non-nuclear stained cells in at least five fields, each containing an average of at least 150 cells, at different time points. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Proteins were separated on 12% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Transfers were blocked overnight at 4 °C with 5% (v/v) nonfat milk in TBS, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the primary antibody diluted in 5% (v/v) nonfat milk in TBS, 0.1%(v/v) Tween 20. The primary antibodies used were as follows: phosphospecific p42/p44MAPK antibody (sc-7383; diluted 1/1000), p42/p44MAPK antibody (sc-154; 1/1000), cyclin D1 antibody (sc-450; 1/1000), cyclin D2 antibody (sc-593; 1/1000), cyclin D3 antibody (sc-6283; 1/1000), cyclin E antibody (sc-481; 1/1000), CDK4 antibody (sc-260; 1/1000), and CDK6 antibody (sc-177; 1/1000) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; cyclin A antibody (C4710) from Sigma. The transfers were rinsed with TBS, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated pig anti-rabbit or rabbit anti-mouse serum (Dako) diluted 1/5000 in 5% (v/v) nonfat milk in TBS, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. The immunoblots were developed with the ECL detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Northern Blot—Cells were plated at 3.0 × 105 in 100-mm dishes similar to the assay for DNA synthesis. Under these conditions, cultures became confluent and quiescent at a saturating density of 3 × 106 cells. In experiments where the levels of cyclin D1 mRNA were determined after various times of addition of growth factors, total RNA was prepared from cells by extracting them with Trizol reagent. Samples (15 μg) were subjected to 1% (v/v) MOPS/formaldehyde agarose-gel electrophoresis and blotted onto nylon membranes. The membranes were hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probes for cyclin D1 and 18 S RNA with a Promega kit, washed, and exposed to x-ray film (36Sauane M. Correa L. Rogers F. Krasnapolski M.

For cyclin D1 the 1.3-kbp EcoRI fragment of pcBZ04.1 was used. Cyclin D1 and 18 S RNA cDNA probes were generously provided by Drs. C. D. Sherr (St. Jude's Hospital, Memphis, TN) and A. R. Kornblihtt (Physiology and Molecular Biology Laboratory, School of Sciences, University of Buenos Aires, Argentina), respectively. LIF and OSM Induce DNA Synthesis through Common Signaling Mechanism(s)—To investigate whether LIF-triggered signals that induce cell proliferation can be shared by other related cytokines, such as OSM, CNTF, and IL-6, we studied their ability to induce cellular entry into S phase in resting Swiss 3T3 cells. Both LIF and OSM, added at either subsaturating (10 ng/ml) or saturating (100 ng/ml) concentrations, stimulated the initiation of DNA synthesis inducing 8 and 29% of cells to enter into S phase after 28 h, respectively (Fig. 1), as shown previously (32Sauane M. Coso O.A. Giulianelli S. Giráldez A.N. Rudland P.S. Jimenez de Asúa L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 313: 926-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). When both LIF and OSM were added together, they caused only an additive effect on the percentage of cells that entered into S phase at any concentration tested (Fig. 1). In contrast, treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with IL-6 or CNTF did not induce cellular entry into the S phase (Fig. 1). Taken together, these results suggest that LIF and OSM may share common signaling pathway(s) to induce the entry into S phase. To examine whether LIF- or OSM-triggered signals differ from those elicited by PGF2α, we analyzed the ability of PGF2α to enhance LIF- or OSM-dependent induction to S phase entry. PGF2α treatment stimulated the initiation of DNA synthesis in Swiss 3T3 cells by inducing 7 and 25% of cells to enter into S phase after 28 h (Fig. 1), similarly to the effect observed with LIF or OSM. Most interestingly, when PGF2α and LIF were added together at either subsaturating or saturating concentrations, the stimulatory effect of LIF or PGF2α in inducing DNA synthesis was potentiated by raising the fraction of cells that entered into S phase to 57 and 67%, respectively (Fig. 1). Similarly, the stimulatory effect of OSM was potentiated by PGF2α (Fig. 1). These results suggest that LIF or OSM in combination with PGF2α exhibited a synergistic effect by increasing the percentage of cells entering S phase. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the synergistic effect observed between LIF or OSM with PGF2α to induce both DNA synthesis and cell division may be due, at least in part, to the activation of different signaling pathways promoted by LIF and OSM with respect to those activated by PGF2α. LIF and PGF2α Activate MAPK Signaling Pathway with a Different Kinetic Pattern—To ascertain whether the mitogenic effect of LIF and PGF2α on Swiss 3T3 cells involved differential activation of a well characterized MAPK cascade (37Pages G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chamgard J.C. Meloche S. Poyssegur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8319-8323Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar), we examined the capacity of LIF and PGF2α to activate ERK. Treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with LIF or PGF2α resulted in different kinetic patterns of ERK activation. LIF promoted a maximum increase of ERK activity only at 12 min (Fig. 2B), whereas PGF2α caused a maximum increase in ERK activity within 4 min (Fig. 2A). There was no change in the levels of p44/p42 MAPK throughout this period (Fig. 2, A and B). Because both LIF and PGF2α promote the activation of ERK1/2, we investigated whether LIF- or PGF2α-triggered activation of ERK is required for their mitogenic effect. Treatment of cells with U0126, a widely used MEK inhibitor (38Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2739) Google Scholar), for 1 h before addition of growth factors caused a significant and progressive reduction in either LIF- or PGF2α-induced ERK phosphorylation without affecting the overall levels of this protein (Fig. 3A). Indeed, U0126 at 10 μm inhibited ERK activity by 90% in both PGF2α- and LIF-stimulated cells (Fig. 3B). Moreover, addition of U0126 from 0.5 to 5 μm to cells prior to LIF or PGF2α treatment resulted in a progressive inhibition of DNA replication (Fig. 3C). However, although U0126 at 1 μm effectively blocked PGF2α-stimulated DNA synthesis by 90%, a higher concentration of 3 μm was required to cause a similar effect with LIF-stimulated cells. In contrast, U0126 did not affect DNA synthesis stimulated by fetal bovine serum (FBS). These results showed that ERK activation is required for both LIF- and PGF2α-triggered cellular entry into S phase, although with a different kinetic pattern. Role of JAK/STAT Signaling Pathway in LIF/PGF2α-induced DNA Synthesis—To investigate whether LIF, OSM, and PGF2α exert a differential stimulation of the JAK/STAT pathway, we examined their ability to cause cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation of the different STATs by indirect immunofluorescence upon treatment of subconfluent resting Swiss 3T3 cells. In control, nonstimulated cells, STAT1 was mainly diffusely distributed within the cytoplasm (Fig. 4A). LIF and OSM treatment promoted nuclear translocation of STAT1 as demonstrated by the nuclear immunostaining of STAT1 (Fig. 4, panels A, B, and D, respectively). In contrast, PGF2α did not trigger STAT1 nuclear localization (Fig. 4A, panel C). Results similar to those found by immunofluorescence were obtained when the subcellular localization of STAT1 was determined by analyzing cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of LIF-stimulated cells by Western blotting (data not shown). Furthermore, LIF, OSM, and PGF2α could not promote translocation of STAT3 or STAT5 to the nucleus in the 3T3 cells (not shown). As positive controls, anti-STAT3 and STAT5 antibodies were able to detect STAT3 and STAT5 cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation in 3T3 L1 pre-adipocytes stimulated by different cytokines, growth factors, and hormones (data not shown) (39Balhoff J.P. Stephens J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 894-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). No translocation was observed with either IL-6 or CNTF, which are not mitogenic for Swiss 3T3 cells (Fig. 4B). To ascertain whether regulation of tyrosine phosphatases is implicated in LIF-dependent nuclear localization of STAT1, Swiss 3T3 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of"
