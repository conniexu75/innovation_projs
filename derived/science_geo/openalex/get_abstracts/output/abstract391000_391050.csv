The large strains cause cracking, pulverization, and a resultant loss of electrical conduction. Huang et al. (p. 1515 ; see the Perspective by Chiang ) used in situ transmission electron microscopy on a single tin oxide nanowire to identify the physical changes that occur during intercalation and observed a moving cloud of dislocations that separated the reacted and unreacted sections. Upon completion of the electrochemical charging, the nanowire showed up to 90% elongation and a 35% increase in diameter."

Witness, for example, the cultural upheavals driven by potato blight in the 1800s. A variety of microbial pathogens continue to afflict crop plants today, driving both loss of yield and incurring the increased costs of control mechanisms. Now, four reports analyze microbial genomes in order to understand better how plant pathogens function (see the Perspective by Dodds ). Raffaele et al. (p. 1540 ) describe how the genome of the potato blight pathogen accommodates transfer to different hosts. Spanu et al. (p. 1543 ) analyze what it takes to be an obligate biotroph in barley powdery mildew, and Baxter et al. (p. 1549 ) ask a similar question for a natural pathogen of Arabidopsis . Schirawski et al. (p. 1546 ) compared genomes of maize pathogens to identify virulence determinants. Better knowledge of what in a genome makes a pathogen efficient and deadly is likely to be useful for improving agricultural crop management and breeding."

After several bites, however, our appetite usually wanes and the offer of a second bar is less appealing than the first. Morewedge et al. (p. 1530 ) show that the decrease in hedonic response can also be induced by having imagined eating the first bar of chocolate. In comparisons of subjects asked to imagine the repetitive consumption of candy or cheese, they observed a specific drop in the amount consumed when subjects were actually offered the previously imagined foods to eat."
https://openalex.org/W1973615174,"For the Love of Iron Iron-loving elements such as Re, Os, Ir, Pt, Rh, Pd, and Au must have been delivered to the upper mantle of Earth, Mars, and the Moon after formation of the planetary cores, because, before that, these elements tended to bond with the core's metallic iron, stripping them from the planetary upper layers. Using Monte Carlo models, Bottke et al. (p. 1527 ) show that the relative abundances of iron-loving elements on Earth, Mars, and the Moon can be explained if most of the impacting planetesimals that delivered the elements had sizes extending up to several thousand kilometers. In these circumstances, most of the iron-loving elements would arrive in a small number of random impacts, the most massive of which hit Earth but not the Moon. Some of these impacts may also have altered Earth's obliquity, produced the Moon's orbital inclination, and delivered water to the Moon's mantle."
https://openalex.org/W1990285247,"The antimalarial agent artesunate (ART) activates programmed cell death (PCD) in cancer cells in a manner dependent on the presence of iron and the generation of reactive oxygen species. In malaria parasites, ART cytotoxicity originates from interactions with heme-derived iron within the food vacuole. The analogous digestive compartment of mammalian cells, the lysosome, similarly contains high levels of redox-active iron and in response to specific stimuli can initiate mitochondrial apoptosis. We thus investigated the role of lysosomes in ART-induced PCD and determined that in MCF-7 breast cancer cells ART activates lysosome-dependent mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. ART impacted endolysosomal and autophagosomal compartments, inhibiting autophagosome turnover and causing perinuclear clustering of autophagosomes, early and late endosomes, and lysosomes. Lysosomal iron chelation blocked all measured parameters of ART-induced PCD, whereas lysosomal iron loading enhanced death, thus identifying lysosomal iron as the lethal source of reactive oxygen species upstream of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. Moreover, lysosomal inhibitors chloroquine and bafilomycin A1 reduced ART-activated PCD, evidencing a requirement for lysosomal function during PCD signaling. ART killing did not involve activation of the BH3-only protein, Bid, yet ART enhanced TNF-mediated Bid cleavage. We additionally demonstrated the lysosomal PCD pathway in T47D and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Importantly, non-tumorigenic MCF-10A cells resisted ART-induced PCD. Together, our data suggest that ART triggers PCD via engagement of distinct, interconnected PCD pathways, with hierarchical signaling from lysosomes to mitochondria, suggesting a potential clinical use of ART for targeting lysosomes in cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1988007786,"Forkhead transcription factor FoxO1 and the NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase SIRT1 are evolutionarily conserved regulators of the development of aging, oxidative stress resistance, insulin resistance, and metabolism in species ranging from invertebrates to mammals. SIRT1 deacetylates FoxO1 and enables activation of FoxO1 transcription in multiple systems. The functional consequences of the interactions between FoxO1 and SIRT1 remain incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that the 1.5-kb rat sirt1 promoter region contains a cluster of five putative FoxO1 core binding repeat motifs (5×IRS-1) and a forkhead-like consensus binding site (FKHD-L). Luciferase promoter assays demonstrate that FoxO1 directly activates SIRT1 promoter activity and that both the IRS-1 and FKHD-L enable FoxO1-dependent SIRT1 transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that FoxO1 binds to the IRS-1 and FKHD-L sites of the SIRT1 promoter. Consistently, FoxO1 overexpression increases SIRT1 expression, and FoxO1 depletion by siRNA reduces SIRT1 expression at both the messenger RNA and protein levels in vascular smooth muscle cells and HEK293 cells. Thus, endogenous FoxO1 is a positive transcriptional regulator of SIRT1. Conversely, SIRT1 promotes FoxO1-driven SIRT1 autotranscription through interacting with and deacetylating FoxO1. Moreover, resveratrol, a plant polyphenol activator of SIRT1, increases FoxO1-dependent SIRT1 transcription activity and thus induces its expression. These findings suggest that positive feedback mechanisms regulate FoxO1-dependent SIRT1 transcription and indicate a previously unappreciated function for FoxO1. This signaling network may coordinate multiple pathways acting upon immune, inflammatory, regenerative, and metabolic processes.

The yeast Sir2 (silent information regulator 2) and its mammalian homologue SIRT1, class III histone deacetylases of the sirtuin family, modulate aging, oxidative stress resistance, cell metabolism, energy homeostasis, insulin resistance, and angiogenesis in several species (1Haigis M.C.

Reduced expression or activity of SIRT1 contributes to insulin resistance and its related diseases, such as type II diabetes mellitus (12Milne J.C. Lambert P.D. Schenk S. Carney D.P. Smith J.J.

In contrast, SIRT1 up-regulates adiponectin expression by deacetylating FoxO1 and thus protects against insulin resistance (14Kadowaki T. Yamauchi T. Kubota N. Hara K. Ueki K. Tobe K. J. Clin.

SIRT1 transgenic mice display improved glucose tolerance and increased metabolic efficiency and have reduced aging-induced diabetes when fed a normal diet (17Banks A.S. Kon N. Knight C. Matsumoto M. Gutiérrez-Juárez R. Rossetti L. Gu W. Accili D. Cell Metab. 2008; 8: 333-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Evidence from genetically engineered mouse models (18Potente M. Ghaeni L. Baldessari D. Mostoslavsky R. Rossig L. Dequiedt F. Haendeler J. Mione M. Dejana E. Alt F.W. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2644-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) shows a key role of SIRT1 in controlling endothelial angiogenic functions during vascular growth. These observations suggest that activation or increased expression of SIRT1 might have a broad spectrum of beneficial effects in metabolic diseases, including diabetes and obesity, as well as in aging-associated cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis. Expression and activity of SIRT1 are tightly regulated at multiple levels. Apoptosis transcriptional regulator E2F1 induces SIRT1 transcriptional expression in response to the stress of DNA damage (19Wang C. Chen L. Hou X. Li Z. Kabra N. Ma Y. Nemoto S. Finkel T. Gu W. Cress W.D. Chen J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1025-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Furthermore, deacetylation of E2F1 by SIRT1 inhibits its activity by a negative feedback mechanism (19Wang C. Chen L. Hou X. Li Z. Kabra N. Ma Y. Nemoto S. Finkel T. Gu W. Cress W.D. Chen J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1025-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). SIRT1 transcription is also negatively regulated by HIC1 (hypermethylated in cancer 1), a tumor suppressor gene, which binds the enhancer elements of the SIRT1 promoter and represses SIRT1 expression (20Chen W.Y. Wang D.H. Yen R.C. Luo J. Gu W. Baylin S.B. Cell. 2005; 123: 437-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 21Zhang Q. Wang S.Y. Fleuriel C. Leprince D. Rocheleau J.V. Piston D.W. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 829-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a concomitant induction of FoxO3a and SIRT1 expression was observed in response to acute nutritional stress (22Nemoto S. Fergusson M.M. Finkel T. Science. 2004; 306: 2105-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). FoxO3a interacts with p53 and binds to the p53 response elements within the mouse Sirt1 promoter, thereby up-regulating SIRT1 transcription (22Nemoto S. Fergusson M.M. Finkel T. Science. 2004; 306: 2105-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). HUR, an RNA-binding protein, associates with the 3′-untranslated region of SIRT1 mRNA and increases SIRT1 expression by stabilizing the SIRT1 mRNA (23Abdelmohsen K. Pullmann Jr., R. Lal A. Kim H.H. Galban S. Yang X. Blethrow J.D. Walker M. Shubert J. Gillespie D.A. Furneaux H. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 543-557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress reduces SIRT1 mRNA and protein levels, and a concomitant reduction of HUR and SIRT1 expression appears during the replicative senescence of human diploid fibroblasts (23Abdelmohsen K. Pullmann Jr., R. Lal A. Kim H.H. Galban S. Yang X. Blethrow J.D. Walker M. Shubert J. Gillespie D.A. Furneaux H. Gorospe M. Mol.

Cell. 2007; 28: 277-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and DBC1 (deleted in breast cancer 1) (25Kim J.E. Chen J. Lou Z. Nature. 2008; 451: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) were recently identified as positive and negative regulators of SIRT1 enzymatic activity, respectively. SIRT1 activity is also regulated by post-translational modifications (2Brooks C.L. Gu W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 26Haigis M.C. Sinclair D.A. Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2010; 5: 253-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). Thus, expression and activity of SIRT1 are subject to complex control patterns at multiple levels that might contribute to the highly multifunctional roles of SIRT1 in regulating cell homeostasis. Transcription factor FoxO family members (and FoxO1 in particular) play important roles in aging, cell metabolism, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress resistance (27Ronnebaum S.M. Patterson C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2010; 72: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 28Gross D.N. van den Heuvel A.P. Birnbaum M.J. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2320-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). FoxO1 activity is tightly regulated. FoxO1 phosphorylation by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt in response to insulin or growth factors leads to the export of FoxO1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, thereby inhibiting its transcription activity (27Ronnebaum S.M. Patterson C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2010; 72: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 28Gross D.N. van den Heuvel A.P. Birnbaum M.J. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2320-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). FoxO1 activity is also regulated by acetylation on specific lysine residues (29Daitoku H. Hatta M. Matsuzaki H. Aratani S. Ohshima T. Miyagishi M. Nakajima T. Fukamizu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10042-10047Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). CREB-binding protein acetylates FoxO1 and disrupts FoxO1-DNA interactions, thereby attenuating FoxO1-dependent gene expression (29Daitoku H. Hatta M. Matsuzaki H. Aratani S. Ohshima T. Miyagishi M. Nakajima T. Fukamizu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10042-10047Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Conversely, SIRT1 increases FoxO1 DNA-binding ability by deacetylating FoxO1 and potentiates its transcription activity (16Qiao L. Shao J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39915-39924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 17Banks A.S. Kon N. Knight C. Matsumoto M. Gutiérrez-Juárez R. Rossetti L. Gu W. Accili D.

Thus, FoxO1 and SIRT1 act synergistically to modulate diverse processes, such as aging, oxidative stress response, and insulin resistance, in a wide range of organisms. However, the precise mechanisms defining the interrelationship of FoxO1 and SIRT1 are incompletely characterized. We posited that FoxO1 may regulate SIRT1 expression transcriptionally. Here we show that FoxO1 directly activates SIRT1 transcription through its binding to the IRS-1 and FKHD-like responsive elements within the rat sirt1 promoter region. Conversely, SIRT1 interacts with and deacetylates FoxO1 and thus potentiates FoxO1-dependent SIRT1 transcription, invoking a putative positive feedback loop mechanism. Finally, resveratrol, a known plant-derived polyphenol activator of SIRT1 that delays aging and protects against the metabolic consequences of high caloric intake in mice (32Baur J.A. Pearson K.J.

These findings provide insights into a novel positive autofeedback mechanism by which this posited FoxO1-SIRT1 circuit may mediate beneficial effects on age-related immunoinflammatory diseases.

Then the virus was removed, and the cells were cultured for an additional 36 h before cell collection. 500 μg of total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with GFP antibodies and protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated overnight with the indicated antibodies. After incubation with secondary antibodies, proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Full-length FoxO1 protein was prepared using the T7 promoter of pcDNA3-FoxO1 expression plasmid by the TNT-coupled transcription/translation systems (Promega). In vitro translated FoxO1 protein was confirmed by Western blotting using anti-FoxO1 antibodies. EMSA was carried out using the LightShift® chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Pierce). Briefly, binding reactions were conducted in binding buffer for 20 min at room temperature using the in vitro translated FoxO1 proteins and biotin-labeled annealed double-stranded probes containing IRS-1bcd or FKHD-L binding sites or mutated probes as described in supplemental Table S3. For competition experiments, unlabeled wild-type probes were mixed with the labeled probes at 100- and 200-fold molar excess prior to the addition of in vitro translated proteins. The reaction mixtures were then loaded onto a 6% native polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at 4 °C for 150 min at 90 V in 0.5× TBE. Following electrophoresis, the gel was transferred to the positively charged nylon membrane (Biodyne®B, P/N 60209) and then analyzed following the manufacturer's instructions. The ChIP assay was done following the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate). VSMCs or HEK293 cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min, lysed, and sonicated. Soluble chromatin was coimmunoprecipitated with anti-FoxO1 or FoxO3a antiserum or an equal amount of rabbit IgG. Cells at ∼80% confluence grown in one 10-cm diameter dish were used per immunoprecipitation. After decross-linking of the DNAs, DNA purified from starting (1% input) and immunoprecipitated samples were subjected to PCR using the primers listed in supplemental Table S4. Those regions of amplification contain the IRS-1 or FKHD-L-binding element in the rat sirt1 promoter (XM_001080493) or two putative FoxO1 DNA-binding elements in the human SIRT1 promoter (NM_012238). Standard PCRs were performed. All values were expressed as mean ± S.E. Data were analyzed by Student's unpaired t test or one-way analysis of variance of the repeated experiments followed by Tukey's post hoc pairwise multiple comparisons when appropriate with Prism (GraphPad software). Statistical significance was accepted at p < 0.05. Aberrant growth, proliferation, differentiation, and migration of VSMCs are fundamental pathogenetic features of cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension and atherosclerosis (36Berk B.C.

To explore the rat homologue of yeast SIR2, we screened the National Center for Biotechnology Information expressed sequence tag and nonredundant databases using the conserved SIR2 domain with the tBlastn and Blastp algorithms. We found that the rat sirt1 gene (GenBankTM accession number XM_001080493) contains 11 exons, which encode a 799-amino acid protein with 94% (571 of 605) and 91% (551 of 604) sequence identities to mouse and human SIRT1 at the amino acid level, respectively. Mouse and human SIRT1 encode proteins with 737 and 747 amino acids, respectively (supplemental Fig. S1). Rat sirt1 was mapped on Rattus norvegicus chromosome 20p11 and spanned 61,147 base pairs according to the results of Blast analysis using the Rat Genome Celera Assembly database (Fig. 1A). We next analyzed the putative transcription factor binding sites within the 2.0-kb promoter region of the rat sirt1 gene using the MatInspector program of the Genomatix portal (available on the World Wide Web). We found that the 2.0-kb rat SIRT1 promoter region contains a cluster of five putative FoxO1 core binding repeat motifs (designated IRS-1abcde, ACAAAAA, from −973 to −732) (41Biggs 3rd, W.H.

Mori N. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). This analysis suggests that SIRT1 expression could be regulated by FoxO family members. Interestingly, two putative consensus FoxO1 DNA-binding elements (−517ACAAAA−512 and −457TGTTTTAA−450, which is complementary at six of seven bases with the FoxO1 core consensus element (ACAAAAA)) are also found in the human SIRT1 promoter (supplemental Fig. S2), suggesting that these FoxO-dependent binding sequences are evolutionarily conserved within SIRT1 homologs. To determine the roles of FoxO family members in rat SIRT1 transcriptional regulation, we cloned the proximal 5′-flanking segments of the sirt1 gene by PCR amplification using genomic DNA isolated from VSMCs. Sequences of cloned 5′-flanking fragments partially overlap and contain the 5′-transcriptional coding sequences within the first exon (supplemental Fig. S3). The sequencing results indicate that the isolated 5′-flanking fragments are indeed the rat sirt1 promoter regions containing the highly conserved FoxO core binding sites. To investigate whether FoxO family members might regulate the rat sirt1 gene transcription, we performed luciferase promoter assays in HEK293 cells using the 1.5-kb rat sirt1 reporter. We found that FoxO1 overexpression increased SIRT1 promoter activity 2–9-fold in a dose-dependent manner, whereas FoxO3a overexpression had a less stimulatory effect (Fig. 2A). These results indicate that FoxO1 robustly and selectively (relative to FoxO3a) activates the rat sirt1 promoter activity. In similar conditions, FoxO1 but not FoxO3a overexpressi"

This feedback has generally been considered to be positive, but so far we have only a qualitative idea of the effect. Dessler (p. 1523 ; see the news story by Kerr ) estimated the magnitude of the feedback by analyzing 10 years of satellite data on the flux of radiation through the top of the atmosphere. As expected, the feedback is positive and within the canonical range of estimates of how much warming will occur for a doubling of atmospheric CO 2 : 2°C to 4.5°C."
https://openalex.org/W2078710083,"The recognition and signaling of DNA double strand breaks involves the participation of multiple proteins, including the protein kinase ATM (mutated in ataxia-telangiectasia). ATM kinase is activated in the vicinity of the break and is recruited to the break site by the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex, where it is fully activated. In human cells, the activation process involves autophosphorylation on three sites (Ser<sup>367</sup>, Ser<sup>1893</sup>, and Ser<sup>1981</sup>) and acetylation on Lys<sup>3016</sup>. We now describe the identification of a new ATM phosphorylation site, Thr(P)<sup>1885</sup> and an additional autophosphorylation site, Ser(P)<sup>2996</sup>, that is highly DNA damage-inducible. We also confirm that human and murine ATM share five identical phosphorylation sites. We targeted the ATM phosphorylation sites, Ser<sup>367</sup> and Ser<sup>2996</sup>, for further study by generating phosphospecific antibodies against these sites and demonstrated that phosphorylation of both was rapidly induced by radiation. These phosphorylations were abolished by a specific inhibitor of ATM and were dependent on ATM and the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex. As found for Ser(P)<sup>1981</sup>, ATM phosphorylated at Ser<sup>367</sup> and Ser<sup>2996</sup> localized to sites of DNA damage induced by radiation, but ATM recruitment was not dependent on phosphorylation at these sites. Phosphorylation at Ser<sup>367</sup> and Ser<sup>2996</sup> was functionally important because mutant forms of ATM were defective in correcting the S phase checkpoint defect and restoring radioresistance in ataxia-telangiectasia cells. These data provide further support for the importance of autophosphorylation in the activation and function of ATM <i>in vivo</i>."
https://openalex.org/W2034043992,"Cellular stress induced by nutrient deprivation, hypoxia, and exposure to many chemotherapeutic agents activates an evolutionarily conserved cell survival pathway termed autophagy. This pathway enables cancer cells to undergo self-digestion to generate ATP and other essential biosynthetic molecules to temporarily avoid cell death. Therefore, disruption of autophagy may sensitize cancer cells to cell death and augment chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Chloroquine and its analog hydroxychloroquine are the only clinically relevant autophagy inhibitors. Because both of these agents induce ocular toxicity, novel inhibitors of autophagy with a better therapeutic index are needed. Here we demonstrate that the small molecule lucanthone inhibits autophagy, induces lysosomal membrane permeabilization, and possesses significantly more potent activity in breast cancer models compared with chloroquine. Exposure to lucanthone resulted in processing and recruitment of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) to autophagosomes, but impaired autophagic degradation as revealed by transmission electron microscopy and the accumulation of p62/SQSTM1. Microarray analysis, qRT-PCR, and immunoblotting determined that lucanthone stimulated a large induction in cathepsin D, which correlated with cell death. Accordingly, knockdown of cathepsin D reduced lucanthone-mediated apoptosis. Subsequent studies using p53+/+ and p53−/− HCT116 cells established that lucanthone induced cathepsin D expression and reduced cancer cell viability independently of p53 status. In addition, lucanthone enhanced the anticancer activity of the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat. Collectively, our results demonstrate that lucanthone is a novel autophagic inhibitor that induces apoptosis via cathepsin D accumulation and enhances vorinostat-mediated cell death in breast cancer models.

Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved degradation pathway that eliminates certain proteins, defective organelles, and protein aggregates (1Yorimitsu T. Klionsky D.J. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1542-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that autophagy may function as a tumor suppressor pathway by degrading cellular components that are damaged or no longer needed (2Apel A. Zentgraf H. Büchler M.W. Herr I. Int. J. Cancer. 2009; 125: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 3Shintani T. Klionsky D.J. Science. 2004; 306: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, mice haploinsufficient for beclin 1 are tumor-prone, and loss of at least one beclin 1 allele has been reported in some primary tumors (4Liang X.H. Jackson S. Seaman M. Brown K. Kempkes B. Hibshoosh H. Levine B. Nature. 1999; 402: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (2771) Google Scholar, 5Qu X. Yu J. Bhagat G. Furuya N. Hibshoosh H. Troxel A. Rosen J. Eskelinen E.L.

However, once cancer has formed activation of the autophagy pathway may be utilized to generate ATP via protein recycling to overcome metabolic/hypoxic stress and maintain survival (6Kondo Y. Kanzawa T. Sawaya R. Kondo S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 726-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar, 7Lum J.J. Bauer D.E. Kong M. Harris M.H. Li C. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B. Cell. 2005; 120: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). Because nutrient and oxygen deprivation are hallmark characteristics of the tumor microenvironment, disrupting of autophagic degradation may be a promising approach to selectively target cancer cells. Previous investigations have proposed that persistent autophagy may lead to a caspase-independent form of cell death following depletion of the minimal amount of organelles and proteins needed for survival (8Hippert M.M. O'Toole P.S. Thorburn A. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 9349-9351Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). However, the process of autophagic breakdown of cellular components to maintain bioenergetics also inhibits cell death induced by growth factor withdrawal, insufficient angiogenesis, and various chemotherapeutic agents (9Carew J.S. Nawrocki S.T. Cleveland J.L. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The induction of autophagy has been observed in malignant cells following treatment with many cancer therapeutics including arsenic trioxide, etoposide, rapamycin, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (sodium butyrate and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, SAHA, vorinostat), tamoxifen, temozolomide, imatinib, bortezomib, and ionizing radiation (10Bursch W.

Considering the dissimilar mechanisms of action of these agents, inhibition of autophagy may be a promising strategy to enhance the activity of a broad range of cancer therapeutics. Disruption of autophagy is commonly achieved by targeted knockdown of genes essential for autophagy such as ATG5 and ATG7 or by using the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or the lysosomotropic drug chloroquine (CQ) 2The abbreviations used are CQ, chloroquine; LMP, lysosomal membrane permeabilization; HCQ, hydroxychloroquine; PI, propidium iodide.

CQ is a weak base that inhibits lysosomal acidification, which prevents the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes and subsequent autophagic degradation (23Poole B. Ohkuma S. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 90: 665-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). CQ and its analog hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been used for many years for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the prophylaxis and treatment of malaria and is now being investigated in clinical trails in combination with conventional cancer therapy (9Carew J.S.

Currently, CQ and HCQ are the only clinically relevant autophagic inhibitors being used in cancer therapy, but their ability to cause ocular toxicity, especially irreversible retinopathy, underscores the need for additional inhibitors of autophagy (28Tehrani R. Ostrowski R.A. Hariman R. Jay W.M. Semin. Ophthalmol. 2008; 23: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Lucanthone (Miracil D) has been extensively used as an anti-schistome agent. The drug also blocks topoisomerase II activity and has been reported to inhibit AP endonuclease (APE1), an important enzyme in DNA base excision repair (29Dassonneville L. Bailly C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 30Luo M. Kelley M.R. Anticancer Res. 2004; 24: 2127-2134PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these properties, lucanthone is currently being investigated as a sensitizer to chemotherapy and radiation. Here we report a novel mechanism of action for lucanthone that is characterized by the disruption of lysosomal function, inhibition of autophagy, and induction of apoptosis. These effects enable lucanthone to potentiate the anticancer activity of vorinostat. Lucanthone-induced apoptosis occurred through a p53-independent mechanism and was, in part, mediated by an increase in cathepsin D levels. Importantly, lucanthone displayed more potent activity against a panel of breast cancer cell lines compared with CQ. Considering that previous clinical investigations of lucanthone did not note any signs of drug-related ocular toxicity, it may have a better safety profile than CQ or HCQ (31Milligan A.J. Katz H.R. Leeper D.B. J Natl. Cancer Inst. 1978; 60: 1023-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Collectively, this study provides evidence that lucanthone inhibits autophagy and provides a rationale for its use in combination with anticancer agents that induce this survival pathway. MDA-MB-231, HCC1954, BT-474, SKBR-3, MDA-MB-435, HCC1937, and BT-20 breast cancer cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). HCT116 53+/+ and p53−/− isogenic cell lines were kindly provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein (John Hopkins, Baltimore, MD). Cell lines were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum under conditions of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Antibodies were obtained from the following commercial sources: anti-tubulin and p53 (Sigma), anti-LC3-II and anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), anti-cathepsin D (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-SQSTM1 (Abnova, Walnut, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for immunoblotting were obtained from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ). Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Bortezomib, etoposide, and vorinostat were purchased from the CTRC pharmacy. Chloroquine, giemsa, propidium iodide, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), bafilomycin A1, pepstatin A, Z-VAD-fmk, and acridine orange were obtained from Sigma. Lucanthone was kindly provided by Spectrum Pharmaceuticals. Cell viability was assessed by MTT assay. Cells were seeded into 96-well microculture plates at 10,000 cells per well and allowed to attach for 24 h. Cells were then treated with lucanthone, chloroquine, vorinostat, or combinations for 72 h. Following drug treatment, MTT was added and cell viability was quantified using a BioTek (Winooski, VT) microplate reader. Effects on cell viability were also determined by measuring ATP levels using the ATPlite assay system (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) and by trypan blue exclusion. Pro-apoptotic effects following in vitro drug exposure were quantified by propidium iodide (PI) staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of sub-G0/G1 DNA content as previously described (32Mahalingam D. Medina E.C. Esquivel 2nd, J.A. Espitia C.M. Smith S. Oberheu K. Swords R. Kelly K.R. Mita M.M. Mita A.C. Carew J.S. Giles F.J. Nawrocki S.T. Clin.

Following drug treatment, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized using 0.2% Triton X-100, and incubated overnight with indicated primary antibodies. Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated fluorescent secondary antibodies were used to visualize protein localization. Images were captured using an Olympus fluorescent microscope (Center Valley, PA) with a DP71 camera and a 60X objective. Image-Pro Plus software Version 6.2.1 (MediaCybernetics, Bethesda, MD) was used for image acquisition. Quantification of fluorescence was determined in 5 random fields using ImageJ software. Cells were plated in chamber slides and treated with lucanthone or CQ for 48 h. After drug treatment, cells were washed with PBS and fixed in methanol for 5 min. Cells were then incubated for 1 h in Giemsa stain diluted 1:20 with deionized water. Cells were rinsed with water and imaged using an Olympus fluorescent microscope. Image-Pro Plus software version 6.2.1 was used for image acquisition. Acidic lysosomes were visualized by acridine orange staining. After treatment with lucanthone or CQ for 48 h, cells were stained with 1 μm acridine orange for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed with PBS and images were captured using an Olympus fluorescent microscope. Based on the acidity, lysosomes appeared as orange fluorescent cytoplasmic vesicles. Quantification of 5 random fields of acridine orange intensity and image acquisition were performed using Image-Pro Plus software Version 6.2.1. Transmission electron microscopy of cells was performed as previously described (19Carew J.S. Medina E.C. Esquivel 2nd, J.A. Mahalingam D. Swords R. Kelly K. Zhang H. Huang P. Mita A.C. Mita M.M.

Sections were cut in an LKB Ultracut microtome (Leica, Deerfield, IL), stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined in a JEM 1230 transmission electron microscope (JEOL, USA, Inc., Peabody, MA). Images were captured using the AMT Imaging System (Advanced Microscopy Techniques Corp, Danvers, MA). Colon cancer cells were incubated with 10 μm lucanthone, 50 μm CQ, or 2.5 μm vorinostat for 48 h. Cells were harvested and were then lysed as previously described (33Nawrocki S.T. Carew J.S. Maclean K.H. Courage J.F. Huang P. Houghton J.A. Cleveland J.L. Giles F.J. McConkey D.J. Blood. 2008; 112: 2917-2926Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Approximately 50 μg of total cellular protein from each sample were subjected to SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in a Tris-buffered saline solution containing 0.1% Tween-20 for 1 h. The blots were then probed overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies, washed, and probed with species-specific secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase. Immunoreactive material was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (West Pico, Pierce). Cathepsin D and non-target SMARTpool siRNA were obtained from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Cells were transfected with 100 nm of each siRNA using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and then treated with drugs for 48 h. Efficiency of RNAi was measured at 48 h by immunoblotting. Lentiviral particles with ATG7 or empty vector shRNA were obtained from Dharmacon. MDA-MB-231 cells were infected for 24 h, and cells were selected with puromycin. ATG7 knockdown was determined by immunoblotting. Breast cancer cells were treated with 10 μm lucanthone for 48 h. Total RNAs were isolated using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) and treated with TURBO DNA-freeTM kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). 300 ng of total RNA per sample was amplified and hybridized to GeneChip® Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. These arrays assay for the expression of about 28,869 well-annotated genes with 764,885 distinct probes. Affymetrix CEL files were imported into Partek® Genomics SuiteTM 6.4 (Partek Inc.) using the default Partek normalization parameters and the robust multi-array average (RMA) analysis adjusted for probe sequence and GC content (GC-RMA). Data normalization was performed across all arrays using quantile normalization. Significantly up-regulated genes (p < 0.05 and > 4-fold increase) were identified. cDNA from lucanthone-treated cells were used for relative quantification by RT-PCR analyses. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed from 1 μg of RNA in a 20 μl reaction mixture using the high-capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Cathepsin D (CTSD) and GAPDH transcripts were amplified using commercially available TaqMan® Gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Relative gene expression was calculated with the 2−ΔCt method using GAPDH as a housekeeping gene (34Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic. Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25871) Google Scholar). Statistical significance of differences observed in samples was determined using the Tukey-Kramer Comparison Test or the Student's t test. Differences were considered significant in all experiments at p < 0.05. Autophagy promotes cell survival and leads to drug resistance by enabling cancer cells to recycle cellular components to generate ATP. In accordance with this, inhibition of autophagy genetically or using compounds such as 3-MA and CQ enhances the activity of many anticancer agents (9Carew J.S. Nawrocki S.T. Cleveland J.L. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Despite the promising potential of targeting this pathway for cancer therapy, CQ and its analog HCQ are currently the only FDA-approved drugs that inhibit autophagy. Lucanthone is an anti-schistome agent that is currently being evaluated for cancer therapy by Spectrum Pharmaceuticals (Fig. 1A). A previous report suggested that lucanthone induced autophagy in schistomes, which was characterized by the formation of autophagic vacuoles (35Clarkson J. Erasmus D.A. J Helminthol. 1984; 58: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, based on its chemical structure, we hypothesized that lucanthone would disrupt lysosomal function and inhibit the final step in autophagic degradation. Consistent with this hypothesis, treatment of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with lucanthone induced lipid modification of LC3-I into LC3-II, which is characterized by the punctate localization of LC3 to autophagosomes (Fig. 1B). LC3-I is recruited to autophagosomes, where LC3-II is generated by site-specific proteolysis and lipidation and is considered an early marker of autophagy (9Carew J.S. Nawrocki S.T. Cleveland J.L. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Lucanthone also induced cytoplasmic vacuolization, which is characteristic of LMP and autophagy (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, lucanthone decreased the red staining intensity of lysosomes with acridine orange indicating a loss of lysosomal acidity following treatment with either CQ or lucanthone (Fig. 1, B and C).FIGURE 1Lucanthone inhibits autophagy. A, chemical structure of lucanthone. B, lucanthone induces LC3-II formation, vacuolization, and LMP. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated for 48 h with 10 μm lucanthone or 50 μm chloroquine. LC3-II was visualized by immunocytochemistry, vacuolization by Giemsa staining, and LMP by loss of acridine orange fluorescence. Electron microscopy demonstrates vacuolization and electron dense particle accumulation. Arrows indicate undegraded protein accumulation. C, quantification of LMP. The degree of red acridine orange staining was measured in MDA-MB-231 cells by immunofluorescence and quantified using ImageJ software. D, lucanthone stimulates SQSTM1/p62 accumulation and aggregation. Cells were treated with 10 μm lucanthone for 48 h. Levels and aggregation of p62 were determined by immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry, respectively. Fluorescence was quantified using ImageJ software. Mean ± S.D., n = 5. * indicates a significant difference from the controls. p < 0.05. E, Bafilomycin A1 does not augment lucanthone-mediated p62 or LC3-II accumulation or apoptosis. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 10 μm lucanthone, 100 nm bafilomycin A1, or both agents for 48 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Inhibition of autophagy results in an accumulation of proteins normally degraded by this pathway. 48-hour exposure to lucanthone or CQ induced an accumulation of electron dense particles when visualized by transmission electron microscopy, suggesting protein aggregation (Fig. 1B). The polyubiquitin-binding protein p62 or sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1) is degraded by autophagy, localized to cellular inclusion bodies, and has been proposed to play a role in facilitating protein aggregate clearance by autophagy (36Mathew R. Karp C.M. Beaudoin B. Vuong N. Chen G. Chen H.Y. Bray K. Reddy A. Bhanot G. Gelinas C. Dipaola R.S. Karantza-Wadsworth V. White E.

Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24131-24145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). Consistent the other markers of autophagy inhibition we observed following treatment with lucanthone, p62 levels were strongly increased following drug treatment (Fig. 1D). Immunocytochemistry revealed that p62 displayed a diffuse staining pattern under basal conditions, but aggregated in response to lucanthone. This effect is in accord with its reported interaction with ubiquitinated proteins (37Pankiv S. Clausen T.H. Lamark T. Brech A. Bruun J.A. Outzen H. Ǿvervatn A. Bjørkøy G. Johansen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24131-24145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). To further evaluate that lucanthone inhibits autophagy, we treated cells with lucanthone in the presence of bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of vacuolar type H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) that prevents the acidification of lysosomes and disrupts autophagic degradation. Consistent with both agents acting as autophagy inhibitors, co-treatment did not induce a further increase in p62 expression or apoptosis (Fig. 1E). Therefore, both lucanthone and CQ induce many of the hallmark features of autophagy (LC3-II formation and vacuolization), but ultimately inhibit autophagy through deacidification of lysosomes. LMP and subsequent inhibition of autophagy had been reported to induce cell death in cancer cells (38Boya P. Andreau K. Poncet D. Zamzami N. Perfettini J.L. Metivier D. Ojcius D.M. Jäättelä M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1323-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 39Boya P. Kroemer G. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 6434-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). To investigate the anticancer activity of lucanthone, cell viability was measured by MTT assay. Lucanthone reduced cell viability to a similar extent in a panel of seven breast cancer cell lines (Fig. 2A). In addition, a direct comparison revealed that lucanthone was significantly more potent than CQ at reducing breast cancer cell viability with a mean IC50 of 7.2 μm versus 66 μm for CQ (Fig. 2A). Measurement of cell viability in two representative cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and BT-20) by ATPlite assay (Fig. 2B) and trypan blue exclusion (Fig. 2C) revealed comparable results. To further characterize the effects of lucanthone on breast cancer cells, expression profiling was performed on the MDA-MB-231 and BT-20 cell lines (supplemental Table S1). Of the genes induced by lucanthone, cathepsin D (CTSD), matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1), and cytochrome P450, family 1, member A1 (CYP1A1) were increased in both cell lines (Fig. 3A). The lysosomal protease cathepsin D is a key mediator of apoptosis and its release into the cytosol has been reported to promote cell death (40Emert-Sedlak L. Shangary S. Rabinovitz A. Miranda M.B. Delach S.M. Johnson D.E. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2005; 4: 733-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 41Fehrenbacher N. Jäättelä M.

Cancer Lett. 2006; 237: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Considering this, we further evaluated the role of cathepsin D during lucanthone-mediated cell death. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) confirmed that lucanthone induced a significant increase in cathepsin D levels in both cell lines (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, lucanthone also increased cathepsin D protein levels 2–3-fold and promoted its cytosolic aggregation as measured by immunocytochemistry (Fig. 3C). We next measured the expression of cathepsin D in four breast cancer cell lines by immunoblotting to investigate its contribution to lucanthone-mediated apoptosis. As expected, cathepsin D levels were strongly increased following lucanthone treatment (Fig. 4A) and correlated with apoptosis (Fig. 4B). To further establish the mechanistic role of cathepsin D in lucanthone-induced apoptosis, siRNA was used to knockdown its expression (Fig. 4C). Cells with reduced cathepsin D levels were significantly less sensitive to lucanthone-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 4C). We next evaluated the role of the aspartyl protease inhibitor pepstatin A, which inhibits cathepsin D and the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk on lucanthone-mediated apoptosis. Both inhibitors blunted apoptosis induced by lucanthone (Fig. 4D). Loss of function of p53 is a frequent event in human cancer that is associated with tumorigenesis and drug resistance (43Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22628) Google Scholar). Therefore, agents that possess efficacy independent of p53 status are highly desirable. We investigated the role of p53 in lucanthone-mediated cell death using HCT116 53+/+ and p53−/− isogenic cell lines (Fig. 5A). As expected, p53-deficient cells were less sensitive to etoposide, a topoisomerase inhibitor that stimulates p53-mediated apoptosis (44Lin X. Ramamurthi K. Mishima M. Kondo A. Christen R.D.

https://openalex.org/W1983867780,"Abnormal aggregation of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) into amyloid fibrils is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes. In this study, we investigated the initial oligomerization and subsequent addition of monomers to growing aggregates of human IAPP at the residue-specific level using NMR, atomic force microscopy, mass spectroscopy, and computational simulations. We found that in solution IAPPs rapidly associate into transient low-order oligomers such as dimers and trimers via interactions between histidine 18 and tyrosine 37. This initial event is proceeded by slow aggregation into higher-order spherical oligomers and elongated fibrils. In these two morphologically distinct types of aggregates IAPPs adopt structures with markedly different residual flexibility. Here we show that the anti-amyloidogenic compound resveratrol inhibits oligomerization and amyloid formation via binding to histidine 18, supporting the finding that this residue is crucial for on-pathway oligomer formation."

We have reported that isolated, permeabilized Plasmodium chabaudi, releases Ca2+ upon addition of exogenous IP3. In the present study, we investigated whether the IP3 signaling pathway operates in intact Plasmodium falciparum, the major disease-causing human malaria parasite. P. falciparum-infected red blood cells (RBCs) in the trophozoite stage were simultaneously loaded with the Ca2+ indicator Fluo-4/AM and caged-IP3. Photolytic release of IP3 elicited a transient Ca2+ increase in the cytosol of the intact parasite within the RBC. The intracellular Ca2+ pools of the parasite were selectively discharged, using thapsigargin to deplete endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ and the antimalarial chloroquine to deplete Ca2+ from acidocalcisomes. These data show that the ER is the major IP3-sensitive Ca2+ store. Previous work has shown that the human host hormone melatonin regulates P. falciparum cell cycle via a Ca2+-dependent pathway. In the present study, we demonstrate that melatonin increases inositol-polyphosphate production in intact intraerythrocytic parasite. Moreover, the Ca2+ responses to melatonin and uncaging of IP3 were mutually exclusive in infected RBCs. Taken together these data provide evidence that melatonin activates PLC to generate IP3 and open ER-localized IP3-sensitive Ca2+ channels in P. falciparum.

The RBC cycle of P. falciparum occurs over a period of 48 h (the life cycles of other Plasmodium species are also multiples of 24 h) and consists of three stages of parasite development known as ring, trophozoite, and schizont. Proliferation occurs by lysis of the RBC to release merozoites, which are the product of the end of shizogony. This is followed by rapid reinvasion of uninfected RBCs to complete the cycle (6Doerig C. Baker D. Billker O. Blackman M.J. Chitnis C. Dhar Kumar S. Heussler V. Holder A.A. Kocken C. Krishna S.

Parasitol. 1994; 63: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 37Wengelnik K. Vial H.J. Res. Microbiol. 2007; 158: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To date, in Apicomplexeans a PLC-like enzyme has been cloned only from Toxoplasma gondii and interestingly the activity of this enzyme was greater with phosphatidylinositol rather than PIP2 as a substrate (28Fang J. Marchesini N. Moreno S.N. Biochem. J. 2006; 394: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, IP3 and DAG increases have been reported during P. falciparum gametocyte exflagellation involved in the sexual cycle and transmission to the mosquito vector (38Martin S.K. Jett M. Schneider I. J. Parasitol. 1994; 80: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and Elabbadi et al., (36Elabbadi N. Ancelin M.L. Vial H.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 63: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) reported ionomycin-induced elevations in IP3 in the asexual RBC stage of the life cycle, indicating an enzyme capable of PIP2 hydrolysis is present in P. falciparum. It is now well established that the host hormone melatonin (12Hotta C.T. Gazarini M.L. Beraldo F.H. Varotti F.P. Lopes C. Markus R.P. Pozzan T. Garcia C.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 466-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and its precursors N-acetylserotonin, tryptamine, serotonin, and N(1)-acetyl-N(2)-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AFMK) affect the intraerythrocytic P. falciparum cell cycle (13Beraldo F.H. Garcia C.R. J. Pineal Res. 2005; 39: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 14Beraldo F.H. Mikoshiba K. Garcia C.R. J. Pineal Res. 2007; 43: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 39Budu A. Peres R. Bueno V.B. Catalani L.H. Garcia C.R. J. Pineal Res. 2007; 42: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These molecules were able to induce Ca2+ release from cultured P. falciparum and P. chabaudi and importantly these responses were blocked by PLC inhibition and melatonin receptor antagonism (14Beraldo F.H. Mikoshiba K. Garcia C.R. J. Pineal Res. 2007; 43: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Similarly, the ability of melatonin and other tryptophan derivatives to synchronize P. falciparum cultures were also blocked by inhibition of PLC and melatonin receptors (13Beraldo F.H. Garcia C.R. J. Pineal Res. 2005; 39: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 14Beraldo F.H. Mikoshiba K. Garcia C.R. J. Pineal Res. 2007; 43: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 40Hotta C.T. Markus R.P. Garcia C.R. Braz. J Med. Biol. Res. 2003; 36: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Whereas, in the intraerythrocytic stages of P. berghei and P. yoelii, two rodent parasites that show asynchronous development (not linked to circadian rhythm) in vivo, melatonin does not modulate their cell cycle or elicit an elevation in intracellular Ca2+ (41Bagnaresi P. Alves E. da Silva H.B. Epiphanio S. Mota M.M. Garcia C.R. Int. J. Gen. Med. 2009; 2: 47-55PubMed Google Scholar). There is clear evidence that P. falciparum and other plasmodium obligate parasites contain the molecular machinery for IP3-dependent Ca2+ release (14Beraldo F.H. Mikoshiba K. Garcia C.R. J. Pineal Res. 2007; 43: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 35Passos A.P. Garcia C.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 38Martin S.K. Jett M. Schneider I. J. Parasitol. 1994; 80: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate unequivocally that intact P. falciparum, within their natural erythrocyte host cell, release Ca2+ in response to IP3. Furthermore, we provide clear evidence that melatonin acts in P. falciparum to activate PLC and induce concurrent elevations in IP3. This key process in P. falciparum survival depends on IP3 receptor function during the trophozoite stage of the intraerythrocytic life cycle. Considering the likely vast genetic divergence between mammalian and plasmodium IP3 receptors, this protein is a strong candidate for novel therapeutic intervention. P. falciparum (D37) parasites were maintained in culture as described (42Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6185) Google Scholar). Briefly, P. falciparum were cultured in RPMI media supplemented with 50 mg/liter hypoxanthine; 40 mg/liter gentamycin; 435 mg/liter NaHCO3; 5% A+ or O human red blood cells and 10% A+ or O human blood serum in an atmosphere of 5% CO2; 3% O2; 92% N2 at 37 °C. Media was changed every 24 h and RBCs replaced every 48 h. Parasitemia and the development stage of synchronized cultures were determined by Giemsa-stained smears. P. falciparum infected erythrocytes were washed in HEPES-buffered saline solution (HBSS) (in mm: 25 HEPES, 121 NaCl, 5 NaHCO3, 4.7 KCl, 1.2 KH2PO4, 1.2 MgSO4, 2.0 CaCl2, 10 glucose, 0.04 probenecid, and 0.25% (w/v) fatty acid-free BSA, pH 7.4) and co-loaded, in suspension, with caged-IP3 (2 μm; siChem) and Fluo4-AM (5 μm; Invitrogen; 37 °C) for 45 min. Cells were washed with HBSS and seeded onto borosilicate glass coverslips coated with ploy-l-lysine and incubated for 15 min at room temperature to enable cell adherence. Cells were washed and mounted on the stage of an Axiovert2000 (Zeiss) spinning disc confocal microscope. Fluo4-AM fluorescence images (Argon laser excitation 488 nm, emission >510 nm) were acquired at 2 Hz with a cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera using the data acquisition software Piper ControlTM (Stanfordphotonics). Photo release of caged-IP3 was achieved by light pulses (1ns duration with a wavelength of 337 nm and 1.45 mJ of energy) from a nitrogen charged UV flash lamp (Photon Technology International) guided through the objective (C-Achromatx40/1.2). Data analysis was performed using ImageJ (NIH). The parasites were synchronized with sorbitol treatment (43Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2840) Google Scholar) and cultured to a parasitemia of >5%. At late trophozoite stage the culture was resuspended in RPMI medium complemented with 5% human serum containing 2.5 μCi/ml [H3-myo]inositol (Perkin Elmer). Labeling continued until young trophozoite phase and >10% parasitemia. The infected erythrocyte culture was then washed in HBSS and preincubated in for 20 min with 10 mm LiCl2 to block inositol monophosphate hydrolysis prior to addition of melatonin or other test agents. The incubation was terminated by addition of ice-cold tricholoroacetic acid, the water soluble [H3]inositol containing components were then extracted by addition of tri-n-octylamine:1,1,2-trichlorofluoroethane (1:1 ratio) and [H3]inositol phosphates were separated by ion exchange chromatography (44Berridge M.J. Downes C.P. Hanley M.R. Biochem. J. 1982; 206: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (1798) Google Scholar) using Dowex resin in the formate form. Lower order inositols and glycerophospholipids were removed by elution with 40 ml 0.4 m ammonium formate/0.1 m formic acid. IP3 and higher order inositols were then eluted with 10 ml of 1.2 m ammonium formate/0.1 m formic acid. Ultima-Flo (Perkin Elmer) was added to the eluate and DPM determined using liquid scintillation counting. Data are expressed as a fold increase over non-infected red blood cell controls loaded with 2.5 μCi/ml [H3-myo]inositol in parallel. In this study, IP3-dependent Ca2+ release has been examined in intact P. falciparum within the host erythrocyte using flash photolysis of cell permeant caged-IP3. The development of this cell permeant form of caged-IP3 (45Dakin K. Li W.H. Cell Calcium. 2007; 42: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) provides a sophisticated tool to manipulate cytosolic IP3 levels under physiological conditions, and is particularly well suited to the intraerythrocytic malaria parasite because this is intractable to other methods to modify cytosolic IP3 levels. Infected erythrocytes were co-loaded with both the cell permeant caged-IP3 and Fluo4-AM for 45 min, a period sufficient to enable de-esterification of these molecules in mammalian systems (46Smith I.F. Wiltgen S.M. Parker I. Cell Calcium. 2009; 45: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). UV flash photolysis of caged-IP3 under these conditions elicited a rapid and transient increase in intracellular Ca2+ in RBCs infected with P. falciparum (Fig. 1A, representative trace of 81 cells from 15 independent experiments and Fig. 1B confocal images with Ca2+ changes shown in pseudocolor). A number of controls were performed to confirm that photorelease of caged IP3 is acting specifically on receptors in P. falciparum within RBCs. Firstly, we assessed the effect of IP3 photolysis on uninfected erythrocytes. Our data demonstrate RBCs are insensitive to UV laser pulses in both the absence Fig. 1C and presence Fig. 1D of caged-IP3. This result was not unexpected as mammalian RBCs lack endoplasmic reticulum. However, these results confirm that these cells are devoid of any IP3 sensitive Ca2+ store and, therefore, do not contribute to the Ca2+ response shown in Fig. 1, A and B. Importantly, we also demonstrate UV laser excitation is without effect on P. falciparum-infected RBC in the absence of caged-IP3 (Fig. 1C). These data also confirm that our protocol to photolyze the chemical cage on IP3 does not result in a Ca2+ response mediated by any cytotoxic effect of UV excitation in infected erythrocytes. All experiments were performed in the presence of 40 μm probenecid, a nonspecific inhibitor of organic anion transport (47Di Virgilio F. Steinberg T.H. Silverstein S.C. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 48Gazarini M.L. Thomas A.P. Pozzan T. Garcia C.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) to block cellular loss and compartmentalization of the Ca2+ indicator. Previous studies have shown that Ca2+ indicator dyes accumulate in the parasite acidic food vacuole (49Biagini G.A. Bray P.G. Spiller D.G. White M.R. Ward S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27910-27915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 50Rohrbach P. Friedrich O. Hentschel J. Plattner H. Fink R.H. Lanzer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27960-27969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), complicating measurements of cytosolic Ca2+ in the intraerythrocytic parasite. Consistent with this, in the absence of probenecid we observed no Ca2+ response to photolysis of caged-IP3 and little or no response to SERCA blockade with thapsigargin in P. falciparum-infected RBCs (Fig. 2A) compared with responses in the presence of probenecide (Fig. 2B). Thus in P. falciparum in the absence of probenecid, anion transporters appear to allow Fluo-4AM accumulation in intracellular compartments. Previous studies in isolated permeabilized malaria parasites have revealed the presence of both ER and acidic vacuole Ca2+ stores within P. chabaudi and P. falciparum (16Varotti F.P. Beraldo F.H. Gazarini M.L. Garcia C.R. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 35Passos A.P. Garcia C.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To establish the sensitivity of these organelles to IP3 in intact P. falciparum, the ability of caged-IP3 to elicit Ca2+ release after depletion of each compartment was characterized in intraerythrocytic parasites. Depletion of the acidic pool with chloroquine (10 μm) did not affect the ability of the P. falciparum to respond to photolysis of IP3 (Fig. 3B, representative trace of 11 cells from three independent experiments). However, depletion of ER Ca2+ with thapsigargin (5 μm) abolished IP3-mediated Ca2+ release (Fig. 3A, representative trace of 12 cells from three experiments). These data suggest that in P. falciparum the ER is the major IP3-sensitive Ca2+ store. We have previously demonstrated that the host hormone melatonin, and its metabolites, elicit Ca2+ increases in intact P. chabaudi (12Hotta C.T. Gazarini M.L. Beraldo F.H. Varotti F.P. Lopes C. Markus R.P. Pozzan T. Garcia C.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 466-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar)- and P. falciparum (13Beraldo F.H. Garcia C.R. J. Pineal Res. 2005; 39: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar)-infected RBCs. Fig. 4, A and B show the melatonin-induced Ca2+ signals with high temporal and spatial resolution. To test the hypothesis that hormone-induced Ca2+ release proceeds via a canonical PLC/IP3 receptor pathway in Plasmodia, we examined the effect of melatonin on polyphosphoinositide levels. Sorbitol treatment was used to synchronize the cultures so that all of the parasites were at the same stage (43Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2840) Google Scholar), and a parasitemia of >5% infected RBCs was obtained prior to [3H-myo]inositol labeling. It has been reported that de novo synthesis of polyphosphoinositides (the lipid precursors for IP3) is greatest during mature parasite development (trophozoite and schizont) and high during invasion and early ring stages of the RBC lifecycle (36Elabbadi N. Ancelin M.L. Vial H.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 63: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 51Olszewski K.L. Morrisey J.M. Wilinski D. Burns J.M. Vaidya A.B. Rabinowitz J.D. Llinás M. Cell Host Microbe. 2009; 5: 191-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Therefore, in our experiments [3H-myo]inositol loading commenced at the late trophozoite stage and the parasites were allowed to go through one RBC invasion cycle to ensure maximum incorporation into the lipid pool. We have found that the Ca2+ responses to melatonin occur predominantly at the trophozoite stage. Therefore, incubations with melatonin were performed after 36 h incubation with [3H-myo]inositol at the early trophozoite phase, which was confirmed with Giemsa-stained smears. At this point, the parasitemia was typically about 10%. Mature erythrocytes, turnover membrane lipids slowly and are devoid of the machinery for de novo inositol lipid synthesis, and thus incorporation of [3H-myo]inositol into the RBC lipids is minimal in comparison to P. falciparum (37Wengelnik K. Vial H.J. Res. Microbiol. 2007; 158: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Consistent with the work of Elabbadi et al., (36Elabbadi N. Ancelin M.L. Vial H.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 63: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), ionomycin (2 μm) was capable of eliciting a robust increase in inositol polyphosphates of 49 ± 20% compared with a basal level of 5 ± 2% in untreated infected RBCs (Fig. 4C) (data from three independent experiments performed in triplicate and expressed as percentage increase over non-infected RBC control). In the same series of experiments, melatonin (100 μm) elicited an increase of 30 ± 14% in inositol polyphosphate generation (Fig. 4C). Increases of inositol polyphosphate formation at lower levels of melatonin followed the same trend, but did not rise to significance when compared with the control cells without added melatonin (basal). To establish whether melatonin and caged-IP3 release Ca2+ from the same intracellular store, we assessed the ability of P. falciparum to respond to photolysis of caged-IP3 after challenging the cells with a maximal dose of melatonin (10 μm). In any given microscope field, a melatonin-induced Ca2+ increase was observed in approximately half of the infected erythrocytes (44 ± 14% in five independent experiments, 54 total cells examined), and almost all of those cells that did not respond to melatonin released Ca2+ upon photolysis of IP3 (50 ± 15%). Fig. 5A, shows representative traces of melatonin and IP3-sensitive P. falciparum from the same coverslip. Interestingly, very few cells were capably of eliciting sequential Ca2+ transients to both melatonin (10 μm) and photolysis of caged-IP3. Only 2 out of the 54 cells (7 ± 4%) generated Ca2+ transients to both stimuli (Fig. 4B). These data showing apparent overlap of the melatonin- and IP3-sensitive Ca2+ intracellular stores are summarized in Fig. 5C. Furthermore, photorelease of caged-IP3 during a melatonin-dependent rise in intracellular Ca2+ did not potentiate the Ca2+ response (Fig. 5D; representative of 4 cells from three independent experiments). Thus, these data provide clear evidence that melatonin releases Ca2+ from the ER IP3-sensitive Ca2+ store in P. falciparum. The above data all describe responses in P. falciparum at the trophozoite stage of the erythrocyte life cycle. Since we postulate that the IP3-dependent signaling cascade plays a vital role in the cell cycle progression, UV photolysis of caged-IP3 was inve"
https://openalex.org/W1964082146,"The phospholipids of Escherichia coli consist mainly of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and cardiolipin. PG makes up ∼25% of the cellular phospholipid and is essential for growth in wild-type cells. PG is synthesized on the inner surface of the inner membrane from cytidine diphosphate-diacylglycerol and glycerol 3-phosphate, generating the precursor phosphatidylglycerol-phosphate (PGP). This compound is present at low levels (∼0.1% of the total lipid). Dephosphorylation of PGP to PG is catalyzed by several PGP-phosphatases. The pgpA and pgpB genes, which encode structurally distinct PGP-phosphatases, were identified previously. Double deletion mutants lacking pgpA and pgpB are viable and still make PG, suggesting the presence of additional phosphatase(s). We have identified a third PGP-phosphatase gene (previously annotated as yfhB but renamed pgpC) using an expression cloning strategy. A mutant with deletions in all three phosphatase genes is not viable unless covered by a plasmid expressing either pgpA, pgpB, or pgpC. When the triple mutant is covered with the temperature-sensitive plasmid pMAK705 expressing any one of the three pgp genes, the cells grow at 30 but not 42 °C. As growth slows at 42 °C, PGP accumulates to high levels, and the PG content declines. PgpC orthologs are present in many other bacteria."

Any two sexes can form a diploid zygote, which will recruit other haploid cells to form a macrocyst. Bloomfield et al. (p. 1533 ; see the Perspective by Kessin ) found that sex in this amoeba is determined by several genes at a locus on chromosome 5, with each mating type represented by a different version of the locus. Not all of the genes were directly essential for successful mating, and the master regulators appeared to be two small soluble intracellular proteins, which control mating types I and III, and a combination of homologs of these two proteins that control mating type II."
https://openalex.org/W2024673940,"We demonstrate that the twin arginine translocation (Tat) system contributes to bacterial resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs). Our results show that a deletion at the tatC gene, which encodes a subunit of the Tat complex, caused Salmonella and Escherichia coli to become susceptible to protamine. We screened chromosomal loci that encode known and predicted Tat-dependent proteins and found that two N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidases, encoded by amiA and amiC, elevated bacterial resistance to protamine and α-helical peptides magainin 2 and melittin but not to β-sheet defensin HNP-1 and lipopeptide polymyxin B. Genetic analysis suggests that transcription of both amiA and amiC loci in Salmonella is up-regulated by the CpxR/CpxA two-component system when nlpE is overexpressed. A footprinting analysis reveals that CpxR protein can interact with amiA and amiC promoters at the CpxR box, which is localized between the predicted −10 and −35 regions but present on different strands in these two genes. In addition, our results show that activation of the CpxR/CpxA system can facilitate protamine resistance because nlpE overexpression elevates this resistance in the wild-type strain but not the cpxR deletion mutant. Thus, we uncover a new transcriptional regulation pathway in which the Cpx envelope stress response system modulates the integrity of the cell envelope in part by controlling peptidoglycan amidase activity, which confers bacterial resistance to protamine and α-helical CAMPs.

IntroductionCationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) 3The abbreviations used are: CAMPcationic antimicrobial peptideIPTGisopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranosideTattwin arginine translocation. are short peptides (12–50 amino acids) that carry positive charges in physiological conditions and generally contain abundant hydrophobic residues to allow for interaction with the bacterial membrane as well as other components of the bacterial envelope (1Brogden K.A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (4272) Google Scholar, 2Zasloff M. Nature. 2002; 415: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (6655) Google Scholar). The specific interaction allows CAMPs to weaken the integrity of the inner and outer membranes and subsequently kill bacterial cells. On the other hand, bacteria have developed a number of mechanisms against CAMPs. For instance, a two-component system in Salmonella, PmrA/PmrB, mediates modification of lipopolysaccharide that reduces the negative charges in lipid A moiety, resulting in a decrease of electrostatic interactions between the outer membrane and CAMPs, thus conferring resistance to these peptides (for a recent review, see Ref. 3Gunn J.S. Trends Microbiol. 2008; 16: 284-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Protamine, an arginine-rich 33-residue CAMP isolated from salmon sperm nuclei (4Ando T.

Microbiology. 1996; 142: 3389-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), whereas magainin 2 and melittin induce leakage of cytoplasmic components by forming pores in the bacterial membrane (8Yang L.

(i) The PhoP/PhoQ system plays a critical role in Salmonella resistance to varied CAMPs, including protamine, magainin 2, and melittin (11Fields P.I. Groisman E.A. Heffron F.

Biochem. 2006; 70: 1688-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The yqjA mutant is susceptible to protamine and α-helical CAMPs, including magainin 2 and melittin (13Shi Y. Cromie M.J. Hsu F.F. Turk J. Groisman E.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that the PhoP-dependent pgtE gene contributes to the resistance to several α-helical CAMPs (15Guina T. Yi E.C. Wang H. Hackett M. Miller S.I. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4077-4086Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli outer membrane protease, OmpT, which shares significant similarity with PgtE, has been demonstrated to confer bacterial resistance to protamine by mediating cleavage of this peptide (16Stumpe S. Schmid R. Stephens D.L. Georgiou G. Bakker E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4002-4006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). (ii) A set of sap loci, encoding factors required for potassium and oligopeptide transport, is essential for Salmonella resistance to protamine (17Parra-Lopez C. Lin R. Aspedon A. Groisman E.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3964-3972Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The sapABCDF operon encodes a periplasmic oligopeptide-binding protein and its inner membrane transporter, which is proposed to transport protamine into the cytoplasm to yield resistance (18Parra-Lopez C.

(iii) The yejABEF operon, which encodes a putative ATP-binding cassette transporter, is suggested to be responsible for resistance to antimicrobial peptides with different structures, including protamine, α-helical melittin, lipopeptide polymyxin B, and β-sheet human defensins (19Eswarappa S.M. Panguluri K.K. Hensel M. Chakravortty D. Microbiology. 2008; 154: 666-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).The twin arginine translocation (Tat) complex is a transporter responsible for the export of folded proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane (20Berks B.C. Sargent F. Palmer T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 260-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). This Sec-independent system consists of three major subunits (TatA, TatB, and TatC), and is known for transporting substrates involved for various cellular activities, such as acquisition of metal ions, energy metabolism, cell wall biogenesis, and virulence (for a review, see Ref. 21Palmer T. Sargent F. Berks B.C. Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13: 175-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In this study, we used a mutant library containing single deletions at Salmonella loci and demonstrated that a Tat-dependent pathway is responsible for resistance to protamine and α-helical CAMPs in Salmonella. With genetic analysis of the known and predicted Tat-dependent loci, we can begin to understand a novel regulatory circuit required for CAMP resistance through modulation of the peptidoglycan metabolism in response to the envelope stress.DISCUSSIONAccording to the results shown in this study, we present a transcriptional regulation pathway that contributes to resistance of Gram-negative bacteria Salmonella and E. coli to specific CAMPs. We demonstrate that (i) the Tat system is required for the resistance to protamine and α-helical CAMPs magainin 2 and melittin; (ii) the Tat-dependent resistance is in part mediated by two of its amidase substrates, AmiA and AmiC; (iii) the CpxR/CpxA two-component system up-regulates amiA and amiC transcription; (iv) the CpxR protein binds to divergent CpxR boxes in the amiA and amiC promoters; and (v) the CpxR/CpxA system facilitates resistance to protamine.The Tat-dependent Cell Wall Amidases Contribute to Resistance to Protamine and α-Helical Antimicrobial Peptides in Enteric BacteriaEnzymes that can cleave peptidoglycan and damage the integrity of bacterial cell wall play a role in cell division, growth, and cell wall remodeling. The Tat-dependent N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidases, AmiA and AmiC, catalyze cleavage of the cross-link formed by the peptide strand and polysaccharide strand of peptidoglycan (21Palmer T. Sargent F. Berks B.C. Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13: 175-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 33Tomioka S. Nikaido T. Miyakawa T. Matsuhashi M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 156: 463-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Heidrich C. Templin M.F. Ursinus A. Merdanovic M. Berger J. Schwarz H. de Pedro M.A. Höltje J.V. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). We have shown that tatC, amiA, and amiC mutants exhibit increased susceptibility to protamine and α-helical CAMPs magainin 2 and melittin (Fig. 2A) (data not shown). This phenotype is probably caused by an altered outer membrane that allows penetration of more peptides to the sites of action (e.g. cytoplasmic membrane) that are located within this barrier. This hypothesis is based on the observation that interference of the AmiA and AmiC function by either disruption of the Tat activity or mutation of the amiA and amiC genes renders the integrity of the E. coli cell envelope highly defective, resulting in increased permeability of the outer membrane to hydrophobic antibiotics and detergents (27Ize B. Stanley N.R. Buchanan G. Palmer T. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, both tatC and amiA amiC mutants of Salmonella displayed increased susceptibility to the antibiotic vancomycin (Fig. 2B), which targets the peptidoglycan of Gram-positive bacteria. However, this antibiotic is prohibited, probably due to its high molecular weight, by the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, Gram-negative bacteria could be sensitized to many antibiotics when pretreated with polymyxin B nonapeptide, a polymyxin B analog that could enhance the permeability of bacterial outer membrane but not kill bacteria by itself (42Vaara M. Vaara T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1983; 24: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).Notably, antimicrobial peptide nisin exhibits bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria by specifically binding to lipid II, a membrane-bound component involved in peptidoglycan synthesis (43Bauer R. Dicks L.M. Int. J. Food Microbiol. 2005; 101: 201-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In Gram-negative bacteria, the pentapeptide moiety of the lipid II intermediates, l-alanyl-γ-d-glutamyl-diaminopimelyl-d-alanyl-d-alanine, should carry negative charges in the physiological condition due to the carboxyl group of the glutamate residue. We hypothesize that the defective outer membrane in the tatC and amidase mutants may allow more CAMP molecules to pass through and interact with the pentapeptide domain via electrostatic force. Thus, an alternative mechanism for protamine and α-helical CAMPs to implement their bactericidal activities might be to bind to the glycan chain during peptidoglycan biosynthesis in the periplasm. It is possible that a pentapeptide in the lipid II intermediate, once bound to protamine, cannot integrate into the peptidoglycan meshwork via the transpeptidation step. On the other hand, the periplasmic amidases, AmiA and AmiC, could probably cleave the pentapeptides to prevent the protamine-glycan complex accumulation, thus conferring resistance to this CAMP. It remains to be investigated why AmiA and AmiC are not required for Salmonella resistance to defensins and polymyxin B although they are also CAMPs.Interestingly, a Salmonella mutant carrying deletion at the amiB locus displayed wild-type resistance to protamine (Fig. 2A). It is possible that AmiB, a Tat-independent periplasmic amidase (44Bernhardt T.G. de Boer P.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1171-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), has a different specificity to the target bond formed between the l-alanine and N-acetylmuramoyl residues, which is located in a particular location of the peptidoglycan meshwork. Although AmiA and AmiC both contribute to resistance to CAMPs, the AmiC amidase appears to act on the peptidoglycan at the septum and is located exclusively at the septal ring during cell division, whereas the AmiA amidase can be detected throughout the periplasm (44Bernhardt T.G. de Boer P.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1171-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidases are widely distributed among bacterial species; therefore, the amidase-dependent mechanism characterized in this study may represent a generalized mechanism for bacterial resistance to α-helical CAMPs and probably other peptides with similar features.The CpxR/CpxA Two-component System Contributes to Resistance to Protamine and α-Helical Antimicrobial Peptides in Enteric BacteriaThe CpxR/CpxA two-component system senses perturbations in the cell envelope and up-regulates the expression of genes encoding factors that combat the damage (for a review, see Ref. 45Raivio T.L. Silhavy T.J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In agreement with its function, we demonstrate that the CpxR/CpxA system contributes to Salmonella resistance to protamine and α-helical CAMPs in this study. Our results further show that the amiA and amiC genes are required for resistance to these peptides (Fig. 2A) (data not shown) and are up-regulated by the CpxR/CpxA system (Fig. 3B). Although the direct action of these Tat-dependent amidases is to modulate cell wall remodeling, they should play a role in the release of bacterial envelope stress because mutations of the amiA and amiC loci or the tatC locus caused a loss of integrity of the bacterial cell envelope (27Ize B. Stanley N.R. Buchanan G. Palmer T. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Thus, it is plausible that the CpxR/CpxA system confers the resistance to CAMPs by combating damage of the cell envelope caused by these peptides or by modifying the outer membrane to prevent CAMPs from binding.Activation of the CpxR/CpxA system by overexpressing nlpE is still able to elevate resistance of the tatC mutant to protamine, indicating that some other CpxR-dependent loci contribute to the peptide resistance in a Tat-independent manner. One of these loci is the yqjA gene, whose transcription is up-regulated by both the PhoP/PhoQ and CpxR/CpxA systems (13Shi Y. Cromie M.J. Hsu F.F. Turk J. Groisman E.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 14Yamamoto K. Ishihama A. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2006; 70: 1688-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The yqjA gene encodes a protein with unknown function but unlikely to be a Tat substrate and is required for magainin 2 and protamine resistance (13Shi Y. Cromie M.J. Hsu F.F. Turk J. Groisman E.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition to the CpxR/CpxA system, other regulatory mechanism(s) should also be responsible for activation of the amiA and amiC genes. Both amiA and amiC are transcribed to similar levels in wild type and the cpxR mutant when grown in LB medium without nlpE overexpression (Fig. 3B), and the cpxR mutant does not display increased susceptibility to protamine when compared with the wild-type parent (Fig. 6A).It is shown that CAMPs are able to induce regulatory activity of some two-component systems. A number of antimicrobial peptides, including polymyxin B and LL-37 (46De Yang Chen Q. Schmidt A.P. Anderson G.M. Wang J.M. Wooters J. Oppenheim J.J. Chertov O. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar), activate the PmrA/PmrB system, thus elevating resistance to these peptides in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (47McPhee J.B. Lewenza S. Hancock R.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In addition, LL-37, as well as other CAMPs, was shown to induce the PhoP/PhoQ system, resulting in up-regulation of the PhoP-activated gene, phoN, in Salmonella (48Bader M.W. Sanowar S. Daley M.E. Schneider A.R. Cho U. Xu W. Klevit R.E. Le Moual H. Miller S.I. Cell. 2005; 122: 461-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). However, CAMPs are unlikely to activate the CpxR/CpxA system because β-galactosidase activity remained similar to that of the amiA-lac and amiC-lac strains grown in LB medium supplemented with or without sublethal concentrations of protamine and magainin 2 (data not shown).The CpxR Regulator Protein Binds to the amiA and amiC Promoters via the CpxR BoxThe CpxR-dependent regulation of the amiA and amiC genes is validated by identifying the CpxR-binding sites in their promoters. Although the CpxR protein used was not further phosphorylated in vitro using acetyl phosphate, the identified CpxR-binding sequences in these genes share similarity to the CpxR box, previously characterized as the CpxR-binding sequence from demonstrated or predicted CpxR-regulated genes (41De Wulf P. McGuire A.M. Liu X. Lin E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26652-26661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The CpxR box in both amiA and amiC promoters is localized within the −35 and −10 regions. A preliminary result showed that substitutions of the CpxR box abolished CpxR-dependent activation of amiA transcription (data not shown). However, we could not rule out the possibility that the amiA promoter was damaged due to these substitutions being located near the −35 and −10 regions. A previous study showed that the PhoP box, the consensus DNA sequence for the PhoP binding (29Lejona S. Aguirre A. Cabeza M.L. García Véscovi E. Soncini F.C. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6287-6294Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), was characterized from a region that overlapped with the −35 region in many PhoP-activated genes (29Lejona S. Aguirre A. Cabeza M.L. García Véscovi E. Soncini F.C. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6287-6294Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, it is plausible that binding of these two-component regulators to the regions located near −35 and −10 could facilitate, but not inhibit, interaction of the RNA polymerase to some specific promoter regions they regulate. On the other hand, the CpxR box, similarly to the amiA promoter, is also located between the −35 and −10 regions of the aer gene in E. coli, which mediates down-regulation of its transcription (41De Wulf P. McGuire A.M. Liu X. Lin E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26652-26661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Further study is ongoing to investigate how CpxR can coordinate RNA polymerase in transcription of amiA and aer.Although the CpxR box is located in the opposite strand at the amiC promoter (Fig. 5E), its transcription is up-regulated in a CpxR-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). A comparable example was found in the P2 promoter of the rpoE operon, in which a CpxR box in the reverse direction was overlapped with the −35 for σE; however, it was responsible for negative regulation of rpoE transcription (41De Wulf P. McGuire A.M. Liu X. Lin E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26652-26661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). According to these observations, it is likely that CpxR interacts with different σ factors, thus facilitating σ70 binding or inhibiting σE binding when it is located on the opposite strand of a promoter region. Furthermore, it has been shown that the CpxR box is located far upstream of the −35 region in three CpxR-activated loci, degP, yihE, and ppiA (50Pogliano J. Lynch A.S. Belin D. Lin E.C. Beckwith J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1169-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Cumulatively, these results indicate divergent models for the CpxR regulatory function, which provide possibilities for further investigation of this stress response regulator.It is very interesting that bacteria such as Salmonella use multiple signaling systems to confer resistance to antimicrobial peptides. A possibility that might explain this phenomenon is that these systems can modify different cellular components in separate parts of bacterial cells under various stresses, thus protecting different targets from attack by CAMPs. In summary, we demonstrate that the CpxR/CpxA system confers Salmonella resistance to protamine and α-helical CAMPs partially dependent on the Tat pathway via amidases, AmiA and AmiC. As illustrated in Fig. 7, our findings provide new insights into the regulatory networks that contribute to bacterial resistance to antimicrobial peptides and greatly enrich our understanding of the new mechanism for envelope stress response governed by the CpxR/CpxA system. IntroductionCationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) 3The abbreviations used are: CAMPcationic antimicrobial peptideIPTGisopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranosideTattwin arginine translocation. are short peptides (12–50 amino acids) that carry positive charges in physiological conditions and generally contain abundant hydrophobic residues to allow for interaction with the bacterial membrane as well as other components of the bacterial envelope (1Brogden K.A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (4272) Google Scholar, 2Zasloff M. Nature. 2002; 415: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (6655) Google Scholar). The specific interaction allows CAMPs to weaken the integrity of the inner and outer membranes and subsequently kill bacterial cells. On the other hand, bacteria have developed a number of mechanisms against CAMPs. For instance, a two-component system in Salmonella, PmrA/PmrB, mediates modification of lipopolysaccharide that reduces the negative charges in lipid A moiety, resulting in a decrease of electrostatic interactions between the outer membrane and CAMPs, thus conferring resistance to these peptides (for a recent review, see Ref. 3Gunn J.S. Trends Microbiol. 2008; 16: 284-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Protamine, an arginine-rich 33-residue CAMP isolated from salmon sperm nuclei (4Ando T. Yamasaki M. Suzuki K. Mol. Biol. Biochem. Biophys. 1973; 12: 1-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as magainin 2 and melittin, both α-helical peptides from frog skin and honeybee (5Zasloff M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 5449-5453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar, 6Habermann E. Science. 1972; 177: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar), have been used as model CAMPs to select chromosomal loci required for bacterial resistance to antimicrobial peptides. It is suggested that protamine may exert its bactericidal effect by disrupting cytoplasmic membrane energization (7Aspedon A. Groisman E.A. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 3389-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), whereas magainin 2 and melittin induce leakage of cytoplasmic components by forming pores in the bacterial membrane (8Yang L. Harroun T.A. Heller W.T. Weiss T.M. Huang H.W. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 641-645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 9Yang L. Harroun T.A. Weiss T.M. Ding L. Huang H.W.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3590-3599Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar).Several independent pathways have been implicated in resistance to these peptides in the Gram-negative species Salmonella typhimurium based the following observations. (i) The PhoP/PhoQ system plays a critical role in Salmonella resistance to varied CAMPs, including protamine, magainin 2, and melittin (11Fields P.I. Groisman E.A. Heffron F. Science. 1989; 243: 1059-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 12Gunn J.S. Miller S.I. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6857-6864Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), mediated in part by the yqjA gene encoding an inner membrane protein of unknown function (13Shi Y. Cromie M.J. Hsu F.F. Turk J. Groisman E.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Transcription of the yqjA gene is regulated in a PhoP- and CpxR-dependent manner (13Shi Y. Cromie M.J. Hsu F.F. Turk J. Groisman E.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 14Yamamoto K. Ishihama A. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2006; 70: 1688-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The yqjA mutant is susceptible to protamine and α-helical CAMPs, including magainin 2 and melittin (13Shi Y. Cromie M.J. Hsu F.F. Turk J. Groisman E.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that the PhoP-dependent pgtE gene contributes to the resistance to several α-helical CAMPs (15Guina T. Yi E.C. Wang H. Hackett M. Miller S.I. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4077-4086Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli outer membrane protease, OmpT, which shares significant similarity with PgtE, has been demonstrated to confer bacterial resistance to protamine by mediating cleavage of this peptide (16Stumpe S. Schmid R. Stephens D.L. Georgiou G. Bakker E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4002-4006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). (ii) A set of sap loci, encoding factors required for potassium and oligopeptide transport, is essential for Salmonella resistance to protamine (17Parra-Lopez C. Lin R. Aspedon A. Groisman E.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3964-3972Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The sapABCDF operon encodes a periplasmic oligopeptide-binding protein and its inner membrane transporter, which is proposed to transport protamine into the cytoplasm to yield resistance (18Parra-Lopez C. Baer M.T. Groisman E.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4053-4062Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). (iii) The yejABEF operon, which encodes a putative ATP-binding cassette transporter, is suggested to be responsible for resistance to antimicrobial peptides with different structures, including protamine, α-helical melittin, lipopeptide polymyxin B, and β-sheet human defensins (19Eswarappa S.M.

https://openalex.org/W2063780360,"PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin-like/kexin type 9) is an emerging target for pharmaceutical intervention. This multidomain protein interacts with the LDL receptor (LDLR), promoting receptor degradation. Insofar as PCSK9 inhibition induces a decrease in plasma cholesterol levels, understanding the nature of the binding interaction between PCSK9 and the LDLR is of critical importance. In this study, the ability of PCSK9 to compete with apoE3 N-terminal domain-containing reconstituted HDL for receptor binding was examined. Whereas full-length PCSK9 was an effective competitor, the N-terminal domain (composed of the prodomain and catalytic domain) was not. Surprisingly, the C-terminal domain (CT domain) of PCSK9 was able to compete. Using a direct binding interaction assay, we show that the PCSK9 CT domain bound to the LDLR in a calcium-dependent manner and that co-incubation with the prodomain and catalytic domain had no effect on this binding. To further characterize this interaction, two LDLR fragments, the classical ligand-binding domain (LBD) and the EGF precursor homology domain, were expressed in stably transfected HEK 293 cells and isolated. Binding assays showed that the PCSK9 CT domain bound to the LBD at pH 5.4. Thus, CT domain interaction with the LBD of the LDLR at endosomal pH constitutes a second step in the PCSK9-mediated LDLR binding that leads to receptor degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2047688072,"Protease-activated receptor (PAR) signaling is closely linked to the cellular activation of the pro- and anticoagulant pathways. The endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) is crucial for signaling by activated protein C through PAR1, but EPCR may have additional roles by interacting with the 4-carboxyglutamic acid domains of procoagulant coagulation factors VII (FVII) and X (FX). Here we show that soluble EPCR regulates the interaction of FX with human or mouse tissue factor (TF)-FVIIa complexes. Mutagenesis of the FVIIa 4-carboxyglutamic acid domain and dose titrations with FX showed that EPCR interacted primarily with FX to attenuate FX activation in lipid-free assay systems. In human cell models of TF signaling, antibody inhibition of EPCR selectively blocked PAR activation by the ternary TF-FVIIa-FXa complex but not by the non-coagulant TF-FVIIa binary complex. Heterologous expression of EPCR promoted PAR1 and PAR2 cleavage by FXa in the ternary complex but did not alter PAR2 cleavage by TF-FVIIa. In murine smooth muscle cells that constitutively express EPCR and TF, thrombin and FVIIa/FX but not FVIIa alone induced PAR1-dependent signaling. Although thrombin signaling was unchanged, cells with genetically reduced levels of EPCR no longer showed a signaling response to the ternary complex. These results demonstrate that EPCR interacts with the ternary TF coagulation initiation complex to enable PAR signaling and suggest that EPCR may play a role in regulating the biology of TF-expressing extravascular and vessel wall cells that are exposed to limited concentrations of FVIIa and FX provided by ectopic synthesis or vascular leakage."

https://openalex.org/W2116668508,"Muscle Building The signaling mechanisms involved in actin filament formation for myofibril formation, which is required for growth factor-induced muscle maturation and hypertrophy, remain unclear. Takano et al. (p. 1536 ; see the Perspective by Gautel and Ehler ) now show that the mechanism involves the interaction of nebulin and N-WASP. N-WASP is an activator of the Arp2/3 complex, which induces branched actin filaments in nonmuscle cells. The nebulin–N-WASP complex formed in muscle, however, causes nucleation of unbranched actin filaments within myofibrils without the Arp2/3 complex. Nebulin–N-WASP–mediated myofibrillar actin filament formation is required for muscle hypertrophy and might explain a congenital hereditary neuromuscular disorder caused by nebulin gene mutation: nemaline myopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2000135565,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) regulate many mammalian physiologic and pathophysiologic processes. These proteins bind with the kinase receptors BMPR-I and BMPR-II, thereby activating Smad transcription factor. In this study, we demonstrate that neogenin, a receptor for netrins and proteins of the repulsive guidance molecule family, is a receptor for BMPs and modulates Smad signal transduction. Neogenin was found to bind directly with BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-6, and BMP-7. Knockdown of neogenin in C2C12 cells resulted in the enhancement of the BMP-2-induced processes of osteoblastic differentiation and phosphorylation of Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8. Conversely, overexpression of neogenin in C2C12 cells suppressed these processes. Our results also indicated that BMP-induced activation of RhoA was mediated by neogenin. Inhibition of RhoA promoted BMP-2-induced processes of osteoblastic differentiation and phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8. However, treatment with Y-27632, an inhibitor of Rho-associated protein kinase, did not modulate BMP-induced phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8. Taken together, our findings suggest that neogenin negatively regulates the functions of BMP and that this effect of neogenin is mediated by the activation of RhoA. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) regulate many mammalian physiologic and pathophysiologic processes. These proteins bind with the kinase receptors BMPR-I and BMPR-II, thereby activating Smad transcription factor. In this study, we demonstrate that neogenin, a receptor for netrins and proteins of the repulsive guidance molecule family, is a receptor for BMPs and modulates Smad signal transduction. Neogenin was found to bind directly with BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-6, and BMP-7.

https://openalex.org/W1993207934,"Ceramides, which are membrane sphingolipids and key mediators of cell-stress responses, are generated by a family of (dihydro) ceramide synthases (Lass1-6/CerS1-6). Here, we report that brain development features significant increases in sphingomyelin, sphingosine, and most ceramide species. In contrast, C(16:0)-ceramide was gradually reduced and CerS6 was down-regulated in mitochondria, thereby implicating CerS6 as a primary ceramide synthase generating C(16:0)-ceramide. Investigations into the role of CerS6 in mitochondria revealed that ceramide synthase down-regulation is associated with dramatically decreased mitochondrial Ca(2+)-loading capacity, which could be rescued by addition of ceramide. Selective CerS6 complexing with the inner membrane component of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore was detected by immunoprecipitation. This suggests that CerS6-generated ceramide could prevent mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, leading to increased Ca(2+) accumulation in the mitochondrial matrix. We examined the effect of high CerS6 expression on cell survival in primary oligodendrocyte (OL) precursor cells, which undergo apoptotic cell death during early postnatal brain development. Exposure of OLs to glutamate resulted in apoptosis that was prevented by inhibitors of de novo ceramide biosynthesis, myriocin and fumonisin B1. Knockdown of CerS6 with siRNA reduced glutamate-triggered OL apoptosis, whereas knockdown of CerS5 had no effect: the pro-apoptotic role of CerS6 was not stimulus-specific. Knockdown of CerS6 with siRNA improved cell survival in response to nerve growth factor-induced OL apoptosis. Also, blocking mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake or decreasing Ca(2+)-dependent protease calpain activity with specific inhibitors prevented OL apoptosis. Finally, knocking down CerS6 decreased calpain activation. Thus, our data suggest a novel role for CerS6 in the regulation of both mitochondrial Ca(2+) homeostasis and calpain, which appears to be important in OL apoptosis during brain development."

Upon infection, inflammation, or tissue damage, its plasma level can rise within hours >1000-fold, providing an early, nonspecific disease indicator of prime clinical importance. In recent years, another aspect of CRP expression has attracted much scientific and public attention. Apart from transient, acute phase-associated spikes in plasma concentration, highly sensitive measurements have revealed stable interindividual differences of baseline CRP values in healthy persons. Strikingly, even modest elevations in stable baseline CRP plasma levels have been found to correlate with a significantly increased risk of future cardiovascular disease. These observations have triggered intense controversies about potential atherosclerosis-promoting properties of CRP. To directly assess potential effects of CRP on atherogenesis, we have generated CRP-deficient mice via gene targeting and introduced the inactivated allele into atherosclerosis-susceptible ApoE−/− and LDLR−/− mice, two well established mouse models of atherogenesis. Morphometric analyses of atherosclerotic plaques in CRP-deficient animals revealed equivalent or increased atherosclerotic lesions compared with controls, an experimental result, which does not support a proatherogenic role of CRP. In fact, our data suggest that mouse CRP may even mediate atheroprotective effects, adding a cautionary note to the idea of targeting CRP as therapeutic intervention against progressive cardiovascular disease.

https://openalex.org/W2164176705,"The MelB permease of Salmonella typhimurium (MelB-ST) catalyzes the coupled symport of melibiose and Na+, Li+, or H+. In right-side-out membrane vesicles, melibiose efflux is inhibited by an inwardly directed gradient of Na+ or Li+ and stimulated by equimolar concentrations of internal and external Na+ or Li+. Melibiose exchange is faster than efflux in the presence of H+ or Na+ and stimulated by an inwardly directed Na+ gradient. Thus, sugar is released from MelB-ST externally prior to the release of cation in agreement with current models proposed for MelB of Escherichia coli (MelB-EC) and LacY. Although Li+ stimulates efflux, and an outwardly directed Li+ gradient increases exchange, it is striking that internal and external Li+ with no gradient inhibits exchange. Furthermore, Trp → dansyl FRET measurements with a fluorescent sugar (2′-(N-dansyl)aminoalkyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside) demonstrate that MelB-ST, in the presence of Na+ or Li+, exhibits appKd values of ∼1 mm for melibiose. Na+ and Li+ compete for a common binding pocket with activation constants for FRET of ∼1 mm, whereas Rb+ or Cs+ exhibits little or no effect. Taken together, the findings indicate that MelB-ST utilizes H+ in addition to Na+ and Li+. FRET studies also show symmetrical emission maximum at ∼500 nm with MelB-ST in the presence of 2′-(N-dansyl)aminoalkyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and Na+, Li+, or H+, which implies a relatively homogeneous distribution of conformers of MelB-ST ternary complexes in the membrane.

In eukaryotic cells, the primary cation responsible for the electrochemical gradient across membranes is Na+, to which most symporters are coupled.

A three-dimensional structure model of MelB was recently built by threading analysis (27Yousef M.S. Guan L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The model suggested a similar overall fold between these two permeases; i.e. MelB is organized in two-helix bundles connected with a central loop and separated by an internal cavity facing the cytoplasmic side.

Although it shares high sequence identity with MelB-EC, MelB of Klebsiella pneumoniae couples melibiose transport only to H+ and Li+, but not to Na+ (32Hama H. Wilson T.H. J. Biol.

MelB of Salmonella typhimurium (MelB-ST) was also reported to catalyze coupled galactoside transport to Na+ or Li+, but not to H+ (42Niiya S. Moriyama Y. Futai M. Tsuchiya T. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 144: 192-199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, MelB-ST was cloned and hetero-expressed in E. coli. Our results indicate that MelB-ST shares similar cosubstrate specificities with MelB-EC, albeit with relatively lower affinities. Moreover, MelB-EC seems to yield a wide range of conformers in the presence of cosubstrate, whereas the conformation distribution of MelB-ST ternary complexes is relatively homogeneous. [3H]Melibiose was custom-synthesized by PerkinElmer Life Sciences. 2′-(N-Dansyl)aminoalkyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (D2G) was kindly provided by Drs. H. Ronald Kaback and Gérard Leblanc. 2-(4′-Maleimidylanilino)-naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (MIANS) was purchased from Invitrogen. Oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, and Vent DNA polymerase were from either Takara Bio USA or New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). All other materials were reagent grade and obtained from commercial sources. S. typhimurium LT2 strain (43Mizushima K. Awakihara S. Kuroda M. Ishikawa T. Tsuda M. Tsuchiya T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 234: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), obtained from Dr. Tomofuse Tsuchiya (Okayama University, Japan), was used for cloning the MelB-ST. E. coli DW2 strain (melA+, ΔmelB, ΔlacZY), obtained from Gérard Leblanc, was used for the expression and functional characterization. E. coli XL1 Blue and DH 5α strains were applied for DNA cloning and plasmid amplification. Chromosomal DNA from S. typhimurium LT2 was used for the PCR template. The forward primer corresponds to a sequence encoding a fragment of Lys77–Ala86, which contains a unique restriction site, NcoI, and the reverse primer complements 3′-terminus of melB gene excluding its stop codon. The PCR product was used as template for further PCR amplification to create variations in the C terminus of MelB. A DNA fragment encoding a His10 tag followed by a stop codon and a unique restriction site SacI was generated by PCR reaction. An expression plasmid pK95 ΔAH/wild-type MelB His6 tag, a gift from Gerard Leblanc, was treated with NcoI and SacI and ligated with these DNA fragments digested by the same restriction enzymes. The final construct, pK95 ΔAH/L5M MelB-ST/CHis10 that encodes the full-length MelB-ST with Met in the position of Leu5, was verified by restriction digestion profile and DNA sequencing. A Val residue in the position of Gly109 was identified among several individual clones, which differs from the DNA sequence database; however, Val109 is conserved in other MelB orthologues. E. coli DW2 strain containing a given plasmid was grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth supplemented with 100 mg/liter ampicillin at 37 °C. The overnight cultures were diluted 20-fold in the same broth supplemented with 0.5% glycerol, shaking for 5 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested and washed with 100 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.5, by centrifugation. RSO membrane vesicles were prepared from E. coli DW2 strain without or with a given plasmid by osmotic lysis as described (44Kaback H.R.

E. coli DW2 cells expressing MelB in 15 ml of LB broth supplemented with 0.5% glycerol were diluted and washed with 50 ml of 100 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.5, for four times to decrease Na+ contamination to a calculated concentration <0.05 μm. The cell pellets were resuspended with 100 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgSO4, adjusted to an A420 of 10.0 (0.7 mg protein/ml), and aliquoted with 50 μl. Transport was initiated by adding 2 μl of [3H]melibiose with a specific activity of 10 mCi/mmol at a final concentration of 0.4 mm in the absence or presence of either 20 mm NaCl or 20 mm LiCl and stopped at a given incubation time by diluting 60-fold with quenching buffer (100 mm potassium Pi, pH 5.5, 100 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgSO4), fast filtrating using one GF75 glass fiber filter (Advantec, Japan), and washing with the same quenching buffer (46Kaback H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 698-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The filters were added with 3 ml of Bio-Safe II (Research Products International Corp.), and the intracellular [3H]melibioses were detected by a scintillation counter (Beckman LS6500). For the transport assay using RSO vesicles, 20 mm ascorbate (Na+-free) and 0.2 mm phenazine methosulfate were added to 2 mg/ml RSO vesicles in 100 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgSO4 to generate the electrochemical H+ gradient (Δμ̃H+) (46Kaback H.R.

Chem. 1971; 246: 5857-5861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After blowing RSO vesicles under oxygen for 20 s, transport was initiated by adding [3H]melibiose (final concentration of 0.4 mm, 10 mCi/mmol) in the absence and presence of 20 mm NaCl or LiCl. At a given incubation time at 23 °C, transports were stopped, and the intracellular [3H]melibioses were detected as described above. RSO membrane vesicles containing MelB-ST in 100 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgSO4 were concentrated to ∼30 mg/ml and pre-equilibrated overnight on ice with 20 mm [3H]melibiose (10 mCi/mmol), 0.75 μm monensin, and 10 μm carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (20Bassilana M. Pourcher T. Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16865-16870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), without or with 20 mm NaCl or LiCl. Aliquots (2 μl) were diluted 200-fold into a given buffer in the absence (efflux) or presence (exchange) of 20 mm unlabeled melibiose (48Kaczorowski G.J. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3691-3697Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and reactions were terminated by dilution and rapid filtration at a given time. Fluorescence was measured with either Hitachi F-7000 or SLM-8100/DMX fluorescence spectrophotometers. Steady-state measurements were performed in a 3-mm quartz cuvette with RSO membrane vesicles containing a given MelB at a protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in 100 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgSO4. Trp was excited at 290 nm and recorded between 300 and 570 nm at 1-nm intervals with slit widths of 2.5 mm for both excitation and emission. Trp → dansyl FRET was assayed by mixing RSO vesicles with fluorescent sugar D2G and displaced by the addition of excess melibiose, as described previously (10Maehrel C. Cordat E. Mus-Veteau I. Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33192-33197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cation bindings in the presence of D2G were measured by adding NaCl or LiCl prior to the displacement of D2G FRET by melibiose. The appKd values for D2G in RSO vesicles containing MelB were determined by titration of D2G in the FRET measurement in the absence or presence of a saturated concentration of NaCl or LiCl. Integrations of displacement (diffFRET) by excess melibiose or β-d-galactopyranosyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, a higher affinity ligand, were plotted as a function of D2G, and hyperbolic function was used to fit to data. RSO vesicles containing MelB in the absence or presence of 20 mm NaCl or LiCl were excited at 290 nm, and FRET signals of D2G, which was added at a concentration close to the appKd value, were traced at 500 nm. At a 30-s interval, melibiose was added stepwise until no change in FRET signal was approached. The percentage of displacement as total bound D2G was plotted as a function of melibiose concentration. EC50 was determined by the hyperbolic fitting to data, and the appKd value for melibiose was calculated by the equation: appKd = EC50/{1 + [D2G]/Kd for D2G}. RSO vesicles containing MelB in the absence of Na+ and Li+ were excited at 290 nm, and FRET emissions of D2G at 10 μm were traced at 500 nm. At a 30-s interval, NaCl or LiCl was added stepwise until no change was reached. The increase of fluorescence intensity was plotted as a function of cation concentration, and K0.5 was determined by fitting with the hyperbola equation. E. coli DW2 (lacY−Z−melA+B−) contains α-galactosidase that hydrolyzes the incoming α-anomer melibiose to galactose and glucose. As a result, the external melibiose concentration remains higher than the inside during melibiose transport (37Franco P.J. Jena A.B. Wilson T.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1510: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In DW2 intact cells, the heterologously expressed MelB-ST catalyzes melibiose downhill transport in a nominally Na+- and Li+-free condition (i.e. in the presence of H+) and the presence of Na+ or Li+ simulated melibiose transport by 2–3-fold (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained with MelB-EC (Fig. 1B), indicating that melibiose transport in both permeases is coupled to H+, Na+, or Li+, with a preference of Na+ > Li+ > H+. Melibiose uptake was performed with RSO vesicles, prepared from DW2 cells expressing MelB-ST, in the presence of Δμ̃H+ imposed across the membrane by adding ascorbate and phenazine methosulfate and blowing under O2 steam (46Kaback H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 698-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 47Konings W.N. Barnes Jr., E.M. Kaback H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5857-5861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The H+-coupled melibiose uptake against the concentration gradient was saturable, and both Na+ and Li+ stimulated the uptake by 2–3-fold (Fig. 1C). The addition of Na+ or Li+ by preincubating with RSO vesicles for 20 s prior to the initiation of transport, or by mixing with [3H]melibiose, exhibits comparable results; however, no uptake can be detected in the absence of Δμ̃H+ (data not shown). RSO vesicles containing MelB-ST (pH, 7.5) were treated with ionophores valinomycin (a K+-specific transporter), nigericin (a H+/K+ antiporter), or both during the transport time course. In the presence of either cation among H+, Na+, and Li+, inhibition of melibiose uptake was observed upon the addition of valinomycin alone or valinomycin with nigericin, whereas no detectable effect was observed by adding nigericin only (Fig. 2). Thus, in the absence and presence of Na+ or Li+, the major driving force for melibiose uptake at pH 7.5 is ΔΨ. These results are consistent with the well established notion that Na+ or Li+ gradient in RSO vesicles is maintained by ΔΨ through the Na+/H+ antiporter (NhaA) (40Wilson T.H. Ding P.Z. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1505: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 42Niiya S. Moriyama Y. Futai M. Tsuchiya T. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 144: 192-199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49West I.C.

An important transport feature by cation-coupled transporters is the reversible reaction. De-energetic RSO vesicles containing MelB-ST were preloaded with 20 mm [3H]melibiose in the absence of Na+ and Li+. Melibiose downhill efflux or equilibrium exchange experiments were carried out by rapid dilution into a given buffer as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The loss of the intracellular [3H]melibiose was observed as a function of time (Fig. 3A, panel I) retaining <20% of internal melibiose at 3 min (data not plotted). Pretreatment of RSO vesicles with the water-soluble thiol reactive agent MIANS largely reduced the efflux rate (Fig. 3A, panel I), with >60% retained at 4 min (data not plotted). In purified MelB-ST, the alkylation of Cys residues by MIANS was protected by excess melibiose. 3M. Yousef, S. Nurva, and L. Guan, unpublished data. Thus, it is likely that most of the outwardly flowed [3H]melibiose, which was detected in the efflux experiment, is mediated by MelB-ST proteins. Furthermore, the addition of external 200 mm Na+ reduced the efflux rate (Fig. 3A, panel II). When the dilution buffer included an equimolar concentration of unlabeled melibiose (20 mm), melibiose exchange exhibited a rate slightly faster rate than efflux (Fig. 3A, panel I). It is striking that the melibiose exchange was reduced by external Li+ but stimulated by external Na+ (Fig. 3A, panel III). Further increase in cation concentration from 20 to 200 mm led to no additional effect. De-energetic RSO vesicles were pre-equilibrated with 20 mm [3H]melibiose and Na+. By diluting into buffers containing an equimolar concentration of Na+ (20/20 mm Na+, in/out), melibiose efflux yielded a slightly faster rate than that in the H+-coupled mode, and exchange was stimulated (Fig. 3B, panel I). Furthermore, [3H]melibiose outward flow was largely stimulated by diluting into a Na+-free buffer (20/0 mm), and a reduced rate was found with a higher external Na+ concentration (20/200 mm) (Fig. 3B, panel II). Conversely, exchange rate was little affected by varying the external Na+ concentration (Fig. 3B, panel III). Similar experiments were performed with Li+. When establishing equimolar concentrations on both sides of membrane, Li+ yielded an opposite effect on efflux and exchange, stimulating efflux and inhibiting exchange (Fig. 3C, panel I). Furthermore, the increase of outside Li+ concentration yielded little effect on the exchange rate; however, the outward flowing rate of melibiose was largely stimulated in the presence of an outwardly directed Li+ gradient (Fig. 3C, panel III). Finally, external Li+ inhibited efflux at a pattern similar to the Na+ effect; i.e. both external Na+ and external Li+ significantly decreased the efflux rate in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3B, panel II, and 3C, panel II). D2G is a fluorescent substrate for both MelB-EC and LacY (10Maehrel C. Cordat E. Mus-Veteau I. Leblanc G. J. Biol.

FRET from Trp residues to the dansyl moiety of the bound D2G has been established with reconstituted purified MelB-EC or membrane vesicles (10Maehrel C. Cordat E. Mus-Veteau I. Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33192-33197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 53Cordat E. Mus-Veteau I. Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33198-33202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the current study, D2G was applied to measure cosubstrate bindings in MelB-ST and to probe conformation of MelB-cosubstrate ternary complexes. RSO vesicles from E. coli DW2 containing MelB-ST in the absence of Na+ and Li+, i.e. in the presence of H+, were excited at 290 nm (Fig. 4, top panel, H+, black curve), yielding a typical Trp emission for membrane proteins with a λmax of 330 nm (data not shown); D2G, which was added to the solution, was excited by the Trp emission, yielding a broad emission between 410 and 570 nm with a λmax of ∼500 nm (red curve). The addition of excess melibiose decreased the dansyl fluorescence intensity (cyan curve); the further addition of melibiose yields no further effect (magenta curve). Little or no change in fluorescence emission is observed upon the addition of the same volume of water, 20% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, used to dissolve the D2G), or the same concentration of non-substrates glucose and sucrose (data not shown). Furthermore, RSO vesicles prepared from E. coli DW2 without MelB were applied as controls. An emission spectrum of D2G with a λmax of 525 nm was detected (Fig. 4, bottom panel, red), which was not affected by the addition of melibiose, Na+, or Li+, and the emission intensity was similar to the magenta curves from DW2 containing MelB (Fig. 4, top and middle panels). These data indicate that the total D2G FRET signal (red curves) observed in MelB-ST is contributed from more than one source, and in the absence of Na+ and Li+, ∼27% displaceable FRET signal by melibiose resulted from the bound D2G in MelB-ST. Similar experiments were carried out as described above, with the addition of Na+ or Li+ prior to the displacement of bound D2G. A 3-fold increase in dansyl emission by Na+ (Fig. 4, top panel, Na+, green curve) was observed in MelB-ST. The further addition of Na+ (blue curve) yields no additional change; additions of excess melibiose decreased the emission (cyan and magenta curves). In the presence of H+ and Na+, all curves obtained from melibiose displacement are overlaid well, and thus, not only represent the background level of FRET but also indicate that bound D2G was fully displaced by melibiose. When applying Li+ instead of Na+, a 6-fold higher stimulation in D2G fluorescence was observed (Fig. 4, top panel, Li+), whereas little or no effect was observed with rubidium or cesium cation (Fig. 4, top panel, Rb+ and Cs+). Consistent with the melibiose transport results, H+, Na+, and Li+ are coupled cations in MelB-ST. The same measurements were performed with RSO vesicles containing MelB-EC. As described (10Maehrel C. Cordat E. Mus-Veteau I. Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33192-33197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), a larger and broader emission between 420 and 570 nm (Fig. 4, middle panel) was observed upon adding D2G. The emission was descended to the background level in the presence of excess melibiose and largely increased by Na+ or Li+, with little effect by Rb+ or Cs+. The bound D2G emission (diffFRET) was deduced from the difference before and after melibiose displacement (Fig. 4, between magenta and red or blue curves). With MelB-ST, bou"
https://openalex.org/W2027918333,"Melleolides and related fungal sesquiterpenoid aryl esters are antimicrobial and cytotoxic natural products derived from cultures of the Homobasidiomycetes genus Armillaria. The initial step in the biosynthesis of all melleolides involves cyclization of the universal sesquiterpene precursor farnesyl diphosphate to produce protoilludene, a reaction catalyzed by protoilludene synthase. We achieved the partial purification of protoilludene synthase from a mycelial culture of Armillaria gallica and found that 6-protoilludene was its exclusive reaction product. Therefore, a further isomerization reaction is necessary to convert the 6-7 double bond into the 7-8 double bond found in melleolides. We expressed an A. gallica protoilludene synthase cDNA in Escherichia coli, and this also led to the exclusive production of 6-protoilludene. Sequence comparison of the isolated sesquiterpene synthase revealed a distant relationship to other fungal terpene synthases. The isolation of the genomic sequence identified the 6-protoilludene synthase to be present as a single copy gene in the genome of A. gallica, possessing an open reading frame interrupted with eight introns."

Histologically, the growth plate of Csgalnact1−/− mice contained shorter and slightly disorganized chondrocyte columns with a reduced volume of the extracellular matrix principally in the proliferative layer. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the level of both aggrecan and link protein 1 were decreased in Csgalnact1−/− cartilage. Western blot analysis demonstrated an increase in processed forms of aggrecan core protein. These results suggest that CSGalNAcT-1 is required for normal levels of CS biosynthesis in cartilage.

CS is usually attached to a core protein, thereby forming a proteoglycan (PG). Depending on the core protein, CS is localized either in the extracellular matrix (ECM) or on the cell surface and is particularly abundant in cartilage and brain. In cartilage, a large CS PG aggrecan, which is thought to contain approximately 100 CS chains, forms PG aggregates together with hyaluronan and link protein 1 (LP-1). The aggregates contribute to water retention and resistance to compression (1Watanabe H. Yamada Y. Kimata K. J Biochem. 1998; 124: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 2Kiani C.

In brain, CS PGs such as aggrecan, versican, and neurocan are present in perineuronal nets, which wrap around the neuronal cell bodies and control neuronal plasticity and interneuronal activity (4Dityatev A.

In addition, biochemical analyses have revealed that CS binds to cytokines and growth factors including midline and pleiotrophin (6Muramatsu T. J.

CS biosynthesis is initiated by the transfer of a GalNAc residue to the linkage region of a GlcUA-β1,3-galactose (Gal)-β1,3-Gal-β1,4-Xyl tetrasaccharide primer that is attached to a serine residue of the core protein (Fig. 1A). Chain elongation then occurs by the alternate addition of GalNAc and GlcUA residues. In mammals, six glycogenes encoding glycosyltransferases have been identified, which are classified into three pairs based on amino acids sequence similarity. The first pair of glycosyltransferases comprises chondroitin sulfate synthase 1 (CSS1)/chondroitin synthase 1 (ChSy1) and chondroitin sulfate synthase 3 (CSS3), which both possess β3GT and β4GT motifs and exhibits dual glycosyltransferase activities of β1,3-glucuronyltransferase (GlcUAT) and β1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GalNAcT) for chondroitin chain elongation (7Kitagawa H.

The second pair comprises CSS2/chondroitin-polymerizing factor (ChPF) and chondroitin sulfate glucuronyltransferase (CSGlcUAT). CSS2 exhibits dual glycosyltransferase activity, similar to CSS1 and CSS3 (9Yada T. Gotoh M. Sato T. Shionyu M. Go M. Kaseyama H. Iwasaki H. Kikuchi N. Kwon Y.D. Togayachi A. Kudo T. Watanabe H.

In our previous study we demonstrated that CSGalNAcT-1 efficiently transfers GalNAc onto the linkage tetrasaccharide in vitro, which is common to heparan sulfate/heparin, and its initiation activity was stronger than CSGalNAcT-2. Furthermore, CSGalNAcT-1 has been shown to be a critical enzyme for CS biosynthesis in cartilage (15Sakai K. Kimata K. Sato T. Gotoh M. Narimatsu H. Shinomiya K. Watanabe H. J. Biol.

Although biochemical characterization of these glycosyltransferases involved in CS biosynthesis has been performed extensively, their individual functions in vivo are not yet understood. In this study, we generated and characterized Csgalnact1−/− mice as the first gene knock-out mouse model of CS glycosyltransferases. The knock-out mice were viable and fertile, but slightly dwarf-like. Analysis of their cartilage showed it to contain a lower amount of CS and a reduced volume of the ECM, where aggrecan is mainly processed. These observations suggest that CSGalNAcT-1 is necessary for normal levels of endochondral ossification, and the decrease in CS amount in the growth plate by its absence causes a rapid catabolism of aggrecan. Mice were maintained in specific pathogen-free conditions in the Laboratory Animal Resource Center at the University of Tsukuba. All experiments were performed according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology and the University of Tsukuba. The targeting vector for Csgalnact1 gene disruption was constructed by ligation of three PCR fragments into a conditional targeting vector cassette. Three arms (left arm, center arm, and right arm) for homologous recombination were amplified by PCR using the following primers containing restriction enzyme recognition sites (shown in lowercase): left arm, 5′-gtttaaacTTTGTACTAATAACTATGTATT-3′ and 5′-ggtaccATATTAATGACGTGGATGTGGT-3′; center arm, 5′-gtcgacACTAAATATATATATGAATG-3′ and 5′-gtcgacCTTCTAACATAGAATAACAAAAC-3′; right arm, 5′-ggcgcgccTTAGGTTGTTAAAATACTTGTC-3′ and 5′-ggcgcgccCATGGACTTTTGCTAAATGA-3′. The amplified products were inserted into the original vector using PmeI and KpnI sites for the left arm, SalI sites for the center arm, and AscI sites for the right arm after sequence confirmation. The targeting vector was linearized by digestion with NotI and transfected into C57BL/6J mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells (16Tanimoto Y. Iijima S. Hasegawa Y. Suzuki Y. Daitoku Y. Mizuno S. Ishige T. Kudo T. Takahashi S. Kunita S. Sugiyama F. Yagami K. Comp. Med. 2008; 58: 347-352PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting cells were selected in medium containing 0.3 mg/ml G418 (Naquarai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). Anticipated homologous recombination was subsequently confirmed by PCR and Southern hybridization. Targeted ES cells were injected into ICR mouse blastocysts to generate chimeric mice. Male mice chimeric for the targeted allele were mated with female Ayu1-Cre mice (17Niwa H. Araki K. Kimura S. Taniguchi S. Wakasugi S. Yamamura K. J.

The resultant heterozygotes bearing the null allele were subsequently interbred to yield wild-type (+/+), heterozygous (+/−), and homozygous (−/−) Csgalnact1 mutant mice. Genotypes were confirmed by PCR using the following three primers: 5′-ATGTAGATGAACTGTCCATCCTA-3′, 5′-AATGGCGACCTGCCTATCTGGA-3′, and 5′-GACGGCTCTCTTGCTTCCAAGGGA-3′. For Southern hybridization, 40 μg of BamHI-digested genomic DNA was resolved on a 0.8% agarose gel and probed with an ∼1-kbp DNA probe amplified by PCR with the following primers: 5′-GAAGTCAGCAAATCTGCCTGCT-3′ and 5′-TTGGAAAAGGAAATGGGCTCA-3′. Probe labeling and signal detection were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions of AlkPhos labeling and detection system (GE Healthcare). Total RNAs were isolated from fresh brain of adult mice and humerus, tibial, and rib cartilages of newborn mice using an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), and cDNA templates were synthesized from the total RNA with a QuantiTect Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen). The primers and probes were selected from TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems). Mm01345503_m1, Mm01189028_m1, Mm00545807_m1, Mm00488952_m1, Mm00477355_m1, and Mm00478620_m1 were used for the quantitative analysis of Csgalnact1, Csgalnact2, aggrecan (Acan), link protein 1 (Hapln1), Adamts1, and Adamts5 genes, respectively. PCR products were measured continuously with an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System. The relative amounts of the transcripts were normalized to the amount of β-actin (Actb) (Mm00607939_s1) transcript in the same cDNA samples. The whole skeletons of embryos (embryonic day (E) 18.5) were fixed in 95% ethanol and stained overnight in a solution containing Alcian blue 8GX (Sigma-Aldrich). Samples were placed in 1% KOH (v/v)/Alizarin red S (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h and then destained with 2–0.2% KOH (v/v)/20–80% glycerol for several days. Cleared specimens were stored in 100% glycerol. Anatomically removed mice tissues were fixed in Mildform 10N (Wako Pure Chemical Industries; Osaka, Japan) after two immediate washings in PBS and then embedded in paraffin. The hard tissues from 2-week-old mice were decalcified in Morse's solution (10% sodium citrate and 22.5% formic acid) for 24 h after fixing in 4% formalin before embedding in paraffin. Four-micrometer-thick sections were prepared from humerus and tibia and subjected to staining with hematoxylin & eosin, Masson's trichrome staining, Alcian blue staining (Muto Pure Chemicals Co., LTD, Tokyo, Japan), and immunohistochemical staining of link protein-1 mAb, 8A4 (Developed Studies Hybridoma Bank at the University of Iowa), and collagen II Ab (Research Diagnostics, Flanders, NJ). Staining of aggrecan using mAb, 1C6 (Developed Studies Hybridoma Bank) was performed on sections treated with chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Hyaluronan staining was performed using biotinylated hyaluronic acid-binding protein (Seikagaku Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All sections were observed with a Keyence Biozero fluorescence microscope (BZ-8000; Keyence, Osaka, Japan). To measure bone length, isolated humerus and tibia from 2-week-old mice were stained with Alizalin red S and Alcian blue 8GX, observed with a digital microscope (VH-8000; Keyence), and then measured with ImageJ software. Statistical analyses were calculated by Student's t test. Humerus, tibial, and rib cartilages were obtained from newborn mice after general anesthesia. GAGs were released from the core protein of 20 mice cartilages with 0.2 m NaOH for 16 h at room temperature. The samples were neutralized by an addition of 4 m acetate, treated with DNase and RNase for 2 h at 37 °C, and digested with 1 mg/ml proteinase K in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 2 h at 37 °C. The samples were centrifuged, and the supernatants were applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column (GE Healthcare) that was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After washing with 10 column volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, GAG-rich fractions were eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 m NaCl. The eluates were precipitated by the addition of 3 volumes of 95% ethanol containing 1.3% potassium acetate. Finally, the precipitate was dissolved in distilled water. To examine the disaccharide compositions of CS, an aliquot of the extracted GAGs was separated from low molecular weight proteins and disaccharides by filtration using Ultrafree-MC (5,000 molecular weight cut-off). Unfiltrated GAGs in the filter cups were treated with 30 milliunits of chondroitinase ABC in 25 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.04% BSA for 2 h at 37 °C, and filtered for a second time using Ultrafree-MC (5,000 molecular weight cut-off). Unsaturated disaccharides in the filtrates were analyzed according to Toyoda's method (18Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Selleck S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2269-2275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) with a slight modification of elution conditions. To examine the chain length of CS, an aliquot of the isolated GAGs was treated with the heparitinase (Seikagaku Corp.) mixture and labeled with [3H]sodium borohydride (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Briefly, 10 μl of sample source was reacted with 8.4 pmol of [3H]sodium borohydride (12 nCi/pmol) for 3 h at room temperature, treated with 2 μl of 2 m CH3COOH, and neutralized with 2 μl of 2 m NaOH. After removal of free [3H]sodium borohydride by precipitation using 3 volumes of 95% ethanol containing 1.3% potassium acetate, the labeled sample was applied to a Superose 6 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 0.2 m NaCl, followed by scintillation counting of each fraction. The cartilage PG was extracted from tibial cartilage of newborn mice using 4 m guanidine hydrochloride method (19Hascall V.C. Kimura J.H. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 769-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The samples of fragmented cartilage depleted of surrounding tissues were treated with 4 m guanidine hydrochloride in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, supplemented with a proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). PG was then extracted for 24 h at 4 °C with gently rotating. The extract was subjected to dialysis against Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl) and digested with chondroitinase ABC after determination of protein concentration. Deglycosylated proteins (5 μg) by chondroitinase ABC treatment were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, and then proteins were transferred to a Hybond ECL (GE Healthcare) membrane. After blocking with 5% skimmed milk for 1 h at room temperature, membrane was blotted with the following primary antibodies: anti-aggrecan mAb (1C6), anti-mouse collagen II Ab (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and anti-β-actin mAb (Sigma-Aldrich). The specific signal of the primary antibody was developed with horseradish peroxidase conjugated to each secondary antibody of anti-mouse IgG (GE Healthcare) and anti-sheep IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) using Western Lighting Plus-ECL (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and Hyperfilm ECL (GE Healthcare). We generated conditional CSgalnact1 mutant mice using the Cre-loxP systems. A targeting vector was constructed in which exon 1, containing the 5′-untranslational region (UTR) and encoding a translational start site followed by the transmembrane domain, was flanked with loxP sequences (Fig. 1B). We confirmed homologous recombination between the targeting vector and the Csgalnact1 locus in C57BL/6J mouse ES cells by PCR and Southern hybridization analyses (data not shown). Chimeric mice were obtained by microinjecting Csgalnact1flox/+ ES cells into mouse blastocyst, and the resulting animals were crossed with C57BL/6J mice to achieve germ line transmission of the floxed allele. Heterozygotes (Csgalnact1+/−) harboring the null allele were successfully generated by mating male Csgalnact1flox/+ with female Ayu1-Cre mice, a general deleter Cre recombinase-expressing transgenic line (17Niwa H. Araki K. Kimura S. Taniguchi S. Wakasugi S. Yamamura K. J. Biochem. 1993; 113: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Then, homozygotes (Csgalnact1−/−) were generated by subsequent interbreeding of Csgalnact1+/−. The genotype of Csgalnact1−/− mice harboring the null allele was confirmed by a PCR method using tail genomic DNA to amplify a 433-bp product from the wild-type (WT) allele and a 258-bp product from the Csgalnact1-null allele (Fig. 1C). Further confirmation was obtained by Southern hybridization using tail genomic DNA (Fig. 1D). The transcripts of Csgalnac1 and another initiation enzyme for CS synthesis, Csgalnact2, were measured using brain and cartilage cDNAs of WT and Csgalnact1−/− littermates by real-time PCR. The level of Csgalnact2 transcript was the same between WT and Csgalnact1−/−, although the Csgalnact1 transcript was undetectable in Csgalnact1−/− mice (Fig. 1E, and see Fig. 7). These results demonstrate successful disruption of Csgalnact1 gene in the C57BL/6J background. The mutant mice developed normally and were fertile. Intercrosses between the heterozygotes gave rise to 49 WT, 118 heterozygous, and 55 homozygous mice, nearly proportional to the expected frequency of 1:2:1. However, the homozygote mice showed a significantly slower growth rate (∼10% reduction) compared with that of their WT littermates (Fig. 2). Despite the smaller size, male and female Csgalnact1−/− mice had a normal lifespan and fertility resulting in viable offspring by inbred mating. To confirm the dwarfism, we measured the bone length of Csgalnact1−/− and WT mice at age 2 weeks. When skeletal preparations of humerus double-stained with Alizarin red and Alcian blue were observed (Fig. 3A), both humerus and tibia of Csgalnact1−/− were found to be clearly shorter than that of their WT littermates. When measured, the length of both humerus and tibia were significantly reduced in Csgalnact1−/− mice (Fig. 3B). We further performed histological analysis of the growth plate at 2 weeks old (Fig. 3C). At this stage, the secondary ossification center is formed, and the growth plate contains columns of proliferative and hypertrophic chondrocytes. The tibial growth plate of 2-week-old Csgalnact1−/− mice exhibited a slight disorganization of chondrocyte columns and a decrease in proliferative chondrocytes. The length of the growth plate was measured by microscopy. The growth plate of Csgalnact1−/− mice was shorter than that of WT (441 ± 10 μm and 307 ± 6 μm for WT and Csgalnact1−/−, respectively). Although the dwarfism of Csgalnact1−/− mice was not apparent by gross appearances a few days after birth, we reasoned that slight changes resulting in dwarfism had occurred at an early stage in development. To determine when these changes are initiated in Csgalnact1−/− mice, we performed an analysis at the embryonic stage. As shown in Fig. 4A, no abnormalities were apparent in the whole skeleton, skull, forelimb, hind limb, lumbar spine, and digits after double staining with Alizarin red and Alcian blue. The short bones of Csgalnact1−/− mice are likely to be due to impairment of endochondral ossification. Thus, we performed histological analysis of the growth plate, which is essential for this process. The growth plate was found to contain columns of chondrocytes at resting, proliferative, and hypertrophic stages. The ECM was mainly in the resting and proliferative zones. Humerus cartilage of Csgalnact1−/− at E18.5 exhibited a decreased ECM volume and densely packed proliferative chondrocytes. Moreover, the chondrocyte columns were slightly disorganized by comparison with those of WT (Fig. 4, B and C). Specifically, the proliferative chondrocyte layer of Csgalnact1−/− was shorter than WT, although the hypertrophic chondrocyte layer was similar in length (Fig. 4D). We further examined the chondrocyte proliferation by in vivo BrdU incorporation. The number of chondrocytes that incorporated BrdU was similar between Csgalnact1−/− and WT (data not shown). These observations indicate that the main abnormality in the Csgalnact1−/− growth plate is a decrease in ECM volume, resulting in short chondrocyte columns. Nonetheless, chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation are almost normal. Next, we performed biochemical analysis of CS chains in cartilage. Initially, it was confirmed that both Csgalnact transcripts were expressed in all cartilage samples from WT mice. Csgalnact1 transcript could not be detected in any of the cartilage samples derived from Csgalnact1−/− mice (Fig. 5A). The chain length and disaccharide composition of CS were determined using cartilage extracts from humerus, tibia, and rib cartilage of WT and Csgalnact1−/− mice as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The elution profile of gel filtration chromatography revealed a peak at fraction 30 in WT and a peak at fraction 28 in Csgalnact1−/− (Fig. 5B). Based on the elution pattern, we estimated that the amount of CS in Csgalnact1−/− cartilage was ∼50% of that in WT (Fig. 5B). This decrease in the amount of CS was more pronounced in the tibia than in the humerus and rib samples. Analysis of disaccharide composition showed a similar sulfation ratio for C0S (HexA-GalNAc), C4S (HexA-GalNAc(4S)) and C6S (HexA-GalNAc(6S)). The relative amounts of C0S, C4S, and C6S in the various samples were as follows: humerus, 11.7%, 85.5%, and 2.8% for WT and 5.6%, 92.1%, and 2.3% for Csgalnact1−/−; tibia, 10.4%, 86.5%, and 3.1% for WT and 6.7%, 90.5%, and 2.8% for Csgalnact1−/−; rib, 2.8%, 96.2%, and 1.1% for WT and 6.3%, 92.1%, and 1.6% for Csgalnact1−/−, respectively (Fig. 5C). These data confirm that the amount of CS in Csgalnact1−/− cartilage is reduced by ∼50%, although the chain length and disaccharide composition are similar to those of WT. Although our biochemical analysis revealed ∼50% decrease in the amount of CS, this decrease alone may not be responsible for the decreased ECM volume observed in Csgalnact1−/− cartilage. Thus, we examined the major ECM molecules of cartilage, including aggrecan, LP-1/Hapln-1, and collagen II. Using anti-aggrecan mAb, 1C6, Csgalnact1−/− humerus cartilage immunostained at E18.5 more faintly than that of WT (Fig. 6, A–D). Aggrecan in WT was mainly localized in the interterritorial zone, whereas in Csgalnact1−/− it was localized in the pericellular zone (Fig. 6, C and D). An anti-LP-1 mAb, 8A4, immunostained Csgalnact1−/− humerus cartilage at E18.5 more faintly than WT (Fig. 6, E and F). Indeed, the relative staining intensity was similar to that observed for aggrecan. In contrast, when collagen II was immunostained, both Csgalnact1−/− and WT cartilage showed a similar level of intensity, although the immunostained area was reduced in Csgalnact1−/− (Fig. 6, G and H). Hyaluronan staining in cartilage also gave a similar level of intensity (data not shown). Next, we determined which process was affected in the decreased deposition of aggrecan and LP-1. When transcriptional levels were investigated in tibia by quantitative real-time PCR, the levels of aggrecan, LP-1/Hapln-1, Adamts1, and Adamts5 in Csgalnact1−/− were found to be similar to those of WT (Fig. 7A). We then performed Western blot analysis of aggrecan. When a PG extract from tibial cartilage was treated with chondroitinase ABC and applied to Western blot analysis, the anti-aggrecan mAb 1C6 detected two bands at >300 kDa i.e. a band at ∼200 kDa and a band at ∼100 kDa in both Csgalnact1−/− and WT. WT samples gave a major band at the highest molecular mass, representing full-length aggrecan core protein. In contrast, Csgalnact1−/− samples showed a major band at ∼200 kDa, with slightly greater signal intensity than that of WT. Moreover, the signal intensity of bands at >300 kDa was substantially diminished by comparison with WT (Fig. 7B), indicating degradation of aggrecan core protein. These results strongly suggest that the decrease in the level of aggrecan in the ECM of Csgalnact1−/− cartilage is mainly due to increased aggrecan degradation. In this study, we generated and analyzed mice lacking Csgalnact1gene expression. The mutant mice exhibited slight dwarfism due to a minor impairment of endochondral ossification. Histological examinations revealed a short proliferative layer with mild disorganization of chondrocyte columns and substantially decreased ECM. Biochemical analysis showed that the amount of CS was only ∼50% that of normal mice. Intriguingly, the levels of processed forms of aggrecan core protein were substantially increased in Csgalnact1−/− cartilage. These results suggest that CSGalNAcT-1 contributes to cartilage formation and subsequent endochondral ossification. Moreover, CSGalNAcT-1 is involved in the metabolism of aggrecan. CS and chondroitin are present in many organisms including Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. Whereas mammals have six CS glycosyltransferases, C. elegans has only two, which are orthologous to CSS1/ChSy1 and CSS2/ChPF. Bacterial strain K4 synthesizes chondroitin modified with fructose, which is catalyzed by a dual glycosyltransferase KfoC (20Ninomiya T. Sugiura N. Tawada A. Sugimoto K. Watanabe H. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21567-21575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The fact that three glycosyltransferases, Ext1, Ext2, and Extl3 (21Nadanaka S. Kitagawa H. J. Biochem. 2008; 144: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), are involved in heparan sulfate biosynthesis suggests that CS glycosyltransferases were evolutionarily duplicated from three ancestral enzymes to six. The presence of three pairs of glycosyltransferases, together with their rather ubiquitous expression patterns, strongly suggests functional redundancy and difficulty in acquiring a phenotype in knock-out mice by targeting a single enzyme. Nonetheless, our observation that the absence of CSGalNAcT-1 causes a decrease in the level of CS in cartilage by as much as ∼50%, despite the presence of all the other enzymes, clearly indicates a functional selectivity of CSGalNAcT-1. Indeed, these results further support our previous hypothesis that CSGalNAcT-1 is a key enzyme for CS biosynthesis in cartilage (15Sakai K. Kimata K. Sato T. Gotoh M. Narimatsu H. Shinomiya K. Watanabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4152-4161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because we have not observed an initiation activity in CSS1/ChSy1 and CSS3/ChSy2, it is likely that CS chain initiation is operated by CSGalNAcT-1 and -2. The expression level of Csgalnact2 was ∼50% that of Csgalnact1 in humerus and tibial cartilages and brain in WT mice, and the level of the CS in Csgalnact1−/− mice was ∼50 and ∼30% (data not shown), respectively. This correlation suggests that both CSGalNAcT-1 and -2 cooperatively contribute to CS biosynthesis and CSGalNAcT-2 alone does not fully compensate CS chain initiation in the absence of CSGalNAcT-1 in these tissues. Our analysis demonstrated that although the levels of CS in Csgalnact1−/− cartilage decreased to ∼50% that of normal mice, the CS chain length remained similar or slightly increased. This observation implies that CSGalNAcT-1 catalyzes chain initiation and does not contribute to chain elongation, consistent with our previous results (15Sakai K. Kimata K. Sato T. Gotoh M. Narimatsu H. Shinomiya K. Watanabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4152-4161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). When we overexpressed Csgalnact1 in chondrocytic cells, the amount of CS increased by ∼2.2-fold, but the chain length remained unaltered. In Csgalnact1−/− cartilage, Csgalnact2, which had stronger chain elongation activity than Csgalnact1 in vitro (14Sato T. Gotoh M. Kiyohara K. Akashima T. Iwasaki H. Kameyama A. Mochizuki H. Yada T. Inaba N. Togayachi A. Kudo T. Asada M. Watanabe H. Imamura T. Kimata K. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3063-3071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), might be able to use excess UDP-GalNAc as a donor substrate more efficiently, resulting in a slight increase in chain length. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated a marked reduction of the ECM, especially of aggrecan and LP-1, in Csgalnact1−/− cartilage. Interestingly, aggrecan was localized to the pericellular region in Csgalnact1−/− cartilage but was diffuse in the WT ECM. Western blotting experiments showed an increase in the level of processed forms of aggrecan and a decrease in the amount of intact core protein. These observations suggest that CS chains attached to the core protein protect them from enzymatic digestion by proteinases. Indeed, GAGs such as CS and keratan sulfate attached to aggrecan core protein affect the manner of cleavage by proteinases (22Pratta M.A. Tortorella M.D. Arner E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39096-39102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although various matrix metalloproteinases, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin motif (ADAMTS)-1, -4, -5, -8, -9, -15 and m-calpain, have been shown to cleave the aggrecan core protein at specific sites (23Nagase H.

Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the mechanism of physiological aggrecan metabolism has not been fully elucidated. Determination of the cleavage sites may lead to identification of proteinases that participate in normal aggrecan metabolism. To date, several gene knock-out mice exhibiting impaired biosynthesis of CS and aggrecan have been reported. For example, knock-out mice of Slc35d1, which encode a nucleotide-sugar transporter transporting UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GalNAc into the endoplasmic reticulum (27Hiraoka S. Furuichi T. Nishimura G. Shibata S. Yanagishita M. Rimoin D.L. Superti-Furga A. Nikkels P.G. Ogawa M. Katsuyama K. Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Ishida N. Isono K. Sanai Y. Cohn D.H. Koseki H. Ikegawa S. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 1363-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), show a marked decrease in CS and die at the embryonic stages. Gene-trapped knock-out mice of C4st1, which encodes chondroitin-4-sulfotransferase involved in 4-O-sulfation of the chondroitin chain, show ∼85% reduction of CS and exhibit severe chondrodysplasia (28Klüppel M. Wight T.N. Chan C. Hinek A. Wrana J.L. Development. 2005; 132: 3989-4003Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In their cartilage, aggrecan is immunostained in the pericellular region, similarly to that of Csgalnact1−/− cartilage. These results strongly suggest that CS chains play an important role in the transportation of aggrecan from the cell surface to the interterritorial zone. Aggrecan knock-out mice display cartilage matrix deficiency (cmd/cmd) (29Watanabe H. Kimata K. Line S. Strong D. Gao L.Y. Kozak C.A. Yamada Y. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 154-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 30Watanabe H. Nakata K. Kimata K. Nakanishi I. Yamada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 6943-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and LP-1-null mice (31Watanabe H. Yamada Y. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) demonstrate a good correlation of the decrease in aggrecan aggregate with severity of skeletal phenotype. Mice cmd/cmd exhibit dwarfism and marked chondrodysplasia and die at the perinatal period, and their growth plates lack chondrocyte columns. LP-1-null mice exhibit a similar but milder phenotype than cmd/cmd mice. Specifically, the growth plate of LP-1-null mice contain disorganized chondrocyte columns and a decrease in aggrecan deposition to ∼25% that of WT. Cmd heterozygotes show a slight dwarfism and cervical intervertebral disc herniation at 1 year of age, where aggrecan deposition is reduced to ∼80%. The dwarfism of Csgalnact1−/− mice is more conspicuous than cmd heterozygotes and much less pronounced than Crtl1-null mice. Thus, the deposition level of aggrecan that contributes to endochondral ossification appears to be <80% and much >25%, although Csgalnact1−/− cartilage contains 50% less CS and aggrecan is partly fragmented. It is still unclear how the decreased CS level causes dwarfism. We speculate that the decreased ECM volume, together with the reduction of aggrecan deposition, disabled the alignment of an adequate number of proliferative chondrocytes that participate in endochondral ossification. Many signaling molecules and growth factors, such as PTHrP (32Amizuka N. Warshawsky H. Henderson J.E. Goltzman D. Karaplis A.C. J.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ is a ligand-activated transcription factor expressed in various immune cells and acts as a transcriptional repressor to inhibit the transcription of many proinflammatory cytokines. But, the function of PPAR-γ in TLR3- and -4-mediated IFN-β production is not well elucidated. Here, we have analyzed the effect of the PPAR-γ agonists on IFN-β production in peritoneal primary macrophages in response to LPS and poly(I:C). PPAR-γ agonists inhibited LPS and poly(I:C)-induced IFN-β transcription and secretion. siRNA knockdown of PPAR-γ expression and transfection of PPAR-γ expression plasmid demonstrated that PPAR-γ agonist inhibits IFN-β production in a PPAR-γ-dependent manner. The ability of the PPAR-γ agonist to inhibit IFN-β production was confirmed in vivo as mice treated with troglitazone exhibited decreased levels of IFN-β upon LPS and poly(I:C) challenge. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) demonstrated that troglitazone treatment impaired IRF3 binding to the IFN-β promoter. Furthermore, troglitazone could inhibit LPS and poly(I:C)-induced STAT1 phosphorylation and subsequent ISRE activation. These results demonstrate that PPAR-γ negatively regulates IFN-β production in TLR3- and 4-stimulated macrophages by preventing IRF3 binding to the IFN-β promoter."

Herp is a mammalian ubiquitin domain protein, which is strongly induced by the unfolded protein response. It is involved in ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) and interacts directly with the ubiquitin ligase Hrd1, which is found in high molecular mass complexes of the ER membrane. Here we present the first evidence that Herp regulates Hrd1-mediated ubiquitylation in a ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain-dependent manner. We found that upon exposure of cells to ER stress, elevation of Herp steady state levels is accompanied by an enhanced association of Herp with pre-existing Hrd1. Hrd1-associated Herp is rapidly degraded and substituted by de novo synthesized Herp, suggesting a continuous turnover of the protein at Hrd1 complexes. Further analysis revealed the presence of multiple Hrd1 copies in a single complex enabling binding of a variable number of Herp molecules. Efficient ubiquitylation of the Hrd1-specific ERAD substrate α1-antitrypsin null Hong Kong (NHK) required the presence of the Herp UBL domain, which was also necessary for NHK degradation.

Previously, we found that Herp associates with high molecular mass protein complexes containing derlin-1, p97, and the ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3) Hrd1/synoviolin, which mediate the ubiquitylation of substrate proteins and their retro-translocation to the cytosol (6Schulze A. Standera S. Buerger E. Kikkert M. van Voorden S. Wiertz E. Koning F. Kloetzel P.M. Seeger M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 10Ye Y. Meyer H.H.

In addition, it has been demonstrated that Herp is able to bind ubiquilin proteins, which have been suggested to mediate shuttling of ubiquitylated substrate proteins to the 26 S proteasome (13Kleijnen M.F.

Although the N-terminal UBL domain of Herp is necessary neither for the interaction with Hrd1 nor for binding ubiquilins (6Schulze A. Standera S. Buerger E. Kikkert M. van Voorden S. Wiertz E.

Here we have analyzed the dynamics of the Herp interaction with Hrd1 and the role of its UBL domain for its function in ERAD. We show enhanced formation of dynamic Herp-Hrd1 complexes upon exposure of cells to ER stress and demonstrate the presence of oligomeric Hrd1 enabling binding of multiple Herp molecules. Furthermore, our study reveals that the UBL domain of Herp is essential for the ubiquitylation and subsequent disposal of mutant α1-antitrypsin. Thus, the data indicate that Herp is able to rapidly stimulate Hrd1-mediated ubiquitylation and degradation of aberrant ER proteins. Plasmids were constructed by PCR amplification from HeLa cDNA or from cDNA clones, purchased from RZPD/ImaGenes, followed by insertion into pSG5 (Novagen) (HERP, HERPΔUBL encoding amino acids 1–10 joined with 88–391, HRD1, HRD1-MYC). HRD1-M-MYC encoding Hrd1C329S was generated from HRD1-MYC by site-directed mutagenesis using QuikChange (Stratagene). To generate HTB-tagged versions, a cassette containing the HTB (RGS-His6 TEV-protease-site biotinylation-sequence) tag derived from pFA6a-HTB-kanMX6 (kindly provided by P. Kaiser, La Jolla, CA) was inserted into the BamHI site of pSG5-based constructs using BamHI/BglII. His-Ub-GFP was generated by subcloning an insert encoding His10-ubiquitin into pEGFP-N3. GenBankTM accession numbers are AF055001 for HERP and AL834263 for HRD1. α1-Antitrypsin null Hong Kong (NHK) was expressed from a pBR322-based Ig-λ expression vector kindly provided by P. Paganetti (Novartis). The shHERP and shGFP plasmids have been described previously (6Schulze A. Standera S. Buerger E. Kikkert M. van Voorden S. Wiertz E. Koning F. Kloetzel P.M. Seeger M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were grown in Iscove's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate method. To generate cell lines stably expressing HTB-tagged proteins, HeLa cells were cotransfected with HRD1-HTB and pLXSP carrying puromycin resistance. Resistant clones were isolated by limiting dilution and screened for expression of HTB-tagged proteins by Western blotting. Polyclonal Herp-specific antiserum was generated as described (6Schulze A. Standera S. Buerger E. Kikkert M. van Voorden S. Wiertz E. Koning F. Kloetzel P.M. Seeger M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The antiserum against Hrd1 was kindly provided by M. Kikkert and E. Wiertz (Leiden University, The Netherlands). The RGS-His antibody was from Qiagen, the p97 antibody (MA3-004) was from Dianova, the polyclonal ubiquitin-specific antiserum was from Dako, the peroxidase-coupled ubiquitin antibody (FK2) was from Enzo, the GAPDH antiserum was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, the α1-antitrypsin antibody used for immunoprecipitation was from Dako, the peroxidase-coupled α1-antitrypsin antibody was from Bethyl Laboratories, and the anti-GFP antibody was from Rockland Immunochemicals. To prepare cell extracts for Western blot analysis, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate). For analysis of protein complexes by tag-based precipitation or immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in buffer A (33 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 150 mm KOAc, 4 mm MgOAc, 1% deoxyBigCHAP (Calbiochem), 10% glycerol) supplemented with CompleteTM (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min on ice. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 14,000 rpm. For precipitation of HTB-tagged proteins, supernatants were incubated with streptavidin-agarose (Novagen) for 2 h and washed in buffer B (buffer A containing 0.2% deoxyBigCHAP instead of 1%). Beads were then suspended in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting. For metabolic labeling, cells grown to confluency were incubated in methionine-free RPMI for 1 h followed by the addition of [35S]methionine (200 μCi/1 × 107 cells) for 30 min. Samples were normalized for [35S]methionine incorporation by scintillation counting. For immunoprecipitations, radioimmune precipitation extracts were incubated for 4 h with the antibody prior to the addition of protein G-Sepharose for 16 h. Beads were then washed with buffer B and eluted in SDS sample buffer. For sequential immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in buffer A. Incubation with the first antibody (anti-Herp or anti-p97) and protein G-Sepharose for 16 h was followed by a first wash with buffer B followed by a 30-min incubation in radioimmune precipitation buffer to dissociate ERAD complexes. Proteins still attached to the beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, whereas supernatants were subjected to a second immunoprecipitation (anti-Hrd1) and analyzed accordingly. Western blotting was performed according to standard protocols using secondary antibodies from Seramun and the ECL Plus detection kit (GE Healthcare). To analyze immunoprecipitations from non-labeled cell extracts by Western blotting, peroxidase-coupled primary antibodies or protein A-HRP (Bio-Rad) were used. Formation of His-tagged ubiquitin conjugates was monitored as described (16Meulmeester E. Frenk R. Stad R. de Graaf P. Marine J.C. Vousden K.H. Jochemsen A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4929-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells (1 × 107) were transfected with NHK, His10-UB-GFP, HERP, HERPΔUBL, HRD1-MYC, or HRD1-M-MYC as indicated for 48 h and treated with 10 μm MG132 for 6 h. After cell lysis using 6 m guanidinium-HCl, ubiquitin conjugates were isolated using Ni-NTA-agarose, washed, and analyzed by immunoblotting. In the alternative approach, 1 × 107 HeLa cells were transfected with NHK, shHERP, shGFP, HERP, HERPΔUBL, HRD1-MYC, or HRD1-M-MYC as indicated and cultured for 24 h followed by MG132 treatment for 6 h. Preparation of cell extracts, immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting was performed as described above. Cells (2 × 107) were lysed in buffer A, loaded on a glycerol gradient (buffer A, but with 0.2% deoxyBigCHAP, no inhibitors, and 15–50% glycerol), and subjected to centrifugation in a Beckman SW40 rotor at 40,000 rpm for 15 h and 49 min at 4 °C. Upon treatment of cells with ER stress-inducing agents such as thapsigargin and tunicamycin, both Herp and Hrd1 are induced by the UPR (4van Laar T. Schouten T.

Commun. 2007; 352: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we set out to compare alterations in their protein levels and elucidate the formation of protein complexes containing both proteins upon exposure of cells to ER stress. To this end, HeLa cells were treated with either thapsigargin or tunicamycin, and cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation and analyzed by Western blotting. As expected, Herp levels were low in untreated cells but were boosted dramatically within 4 h after exposure to thapsigargin or tunicamycin (Fig. 1A). To detect steady state levels of Hrd1, we had to perform Hrd1-specific immunoprecipitations as available Hrd1 antibodies were insufficient to directly detect the protein in immunoblots of HeLa cell extracts. We found that in contrast to Herp, the amount of Hrd1 remained virtually constant within 8 h of treatment with thapsigargin or tunicamycin. However, the elevation of Herp levels detected upon the addition of the reagents was accompanied by an enhanced coprecipitation of Herp with Hrd1 and vice versa. In summary, exposure of cells to thapsigargin or tunicamycin led to a dramatic increase of Herp steady state levels and an enhanced formation of Herp- and Hrd1-containing complexes. To study the dynamics of the interaction between Herp and Hrd1, pulse-chase experiments followed by co-immunoprecipitations were performed. These experiments enabled us to monitor the stability of Herp and its association with Hrd1 over time. As a control, we used p97, which is known to be a stable protein that also interacts with Hrd1. HeLa cells were treated with thapsigargin for 6 h to induce ER stress and the expression of UPR target proteins such as Herp and Hrd1. Then cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 60 min and analyzed immediately or after incubation for 3 and 6 h with medium lacking radioactively labeled amino acids (Fig. 1B). We found that de novo synthesized Herp and Herp- or p97-associated Hrd1 were increased in cells exposed to thapsigargin, whereas p97 levels seemed not to be affected. Although Herp is rapidly degraded, p97 as well as Herp- or p97-associated Hrd1 species were stable for at least 6 h. As these data indicated that labeled Herp associated with Hrd1 is replaced by de novo synthesized Herp, we used cycloheximide (CHX) to block translation and therefore prevent synthesis of Herp after pulse-labeling. Indeed, the addition of CHX resulted in a decreased coprecipitation of labeled Hrd1 with Herp, whereas the amount of Hrd1 coprecipitated with p97 remained constant for at least 6 h. The data therefore suggest a continuous process in which de novo synthesized Herp binds pre-existing Hrd1 and is then degraded. In a previous study, we have shown that in vitro, a cytosolic C-terminal fragment of Hrd1 is able to oligomerize and bind directly to an N-terminal fragment of Herp (6Schulze A. Standera S. Buerger E. Kikkert M. van Voorden S. Wiertz E. Koning F. Kloetzel P.M. Seeger M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). As the presence of oligomeric Hrd1 would enable binding of multiple Herp molecules to a single Hrd1 complex, we asked whether Hrd1 forms oligomeric structures in the cell. To test this hypothesis, we generated HeLa cell lines expressing Hrd1 with a C-terminal tandem tag containing RGS-His6 and an in vivo biotinylation site (Hrd1-HTB). Extracts from two Hrd1-HTB-expressing cell clones (6 and 36) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with Hrd1-specific antiserum and streptavidin-agarose precipitation (Fig. 2A). As evident from the Western blots of the Hrd1 immunoprecipitates stained by the RGS-His antibody, levels of Hrd1-HTB in clone 6 were lower when compared with clone 36. Thus, the amount of the fusion protein in clone 6 was below the detection limit of the Hrd1 antiserum. In both clones, levels of WT-Hrd1 were similar to the HeLa control and exceeded the level of Hrd1-HTB by far. Streptavidin-agarose precipitation of Hrd1-HTB resulted in coprecipitation of WT-Hrd1, indicating that both Hrd1 species are present in a common complex. Notably, in both clones, the amount of WT-Hrd1 coprecipitated with Hrd1-HTB exceeded the amount of Hrd1-HTB considerably. Thus, we concluded that the number of Hrd1 molecules in a single complex is at least equal to the sum of the WT-Hrd1 and Hrd1-HTB amounts divided by the amount of Hrd1-HTB. Although similar amounts of Herp were coprecipitated with the Hrd1 antiserum from the HeLa control as well as from the transfectants, it was as expected absent from streptavidin-agarose precipitates of the control cells. Due to higher amounts of Hrd1-HTB present in clone 36 when compared with clone 6, there was also an increased coprecipitation of WT-Hrd1 and Herp. To ensure that Hrd1-HTB is present only in high molecular mass complexes, we subjected extracts of Hrd1-HTB cells (clone 36) to glycerol gradient centrifugation followed by streptavidin-agarose precipitation (Fig. 2B). Hrd1-HTB was detected exclusively in high density fractions of the gradient, in which it was found to coprecipitate with endogenous Herp and p97. Therefore, Hrd1-HTB is completely integrated into high molecular mass complexes. As coprecipitation of p97 peaks between fractions 8 and 9, whereas the Hrd1 and Herp peaks are found in fractions 7 and 8, it is likely that there are different Hrd1-containing multimers, which vary with respect to their association with p97. In addition, we observed that Hrd1 proteins in complexes containing Hrd1-HTB were stable for at least 6 h, indicating that the tag did not interfere with their stability (Fig. 2C). The data therefore suggest the existence of oligomeric complexes comprising multiple Hrd1 molecules that each contain a Herp-binding site. Considering the association of Herp with Hrd1, we reasoned that Herp might be required for the Hrd1-mediated ubiquitylation of substrate proteins. To test this hypothesis, we employed an in vivo ubiquitylation assay to analyze the effect of Herp on the ubiquitylation of NHK, which has been identified as a substrate of Hrd1 (22Christianson J.C. Shaler T.A. Tyler R.E. Kopito R.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 272-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). NHK was coexpressed with His-tagged ubiquitin, and the accumulation of specific ubiquitin conjugates was monitored upon inhibition of the proteasome. Analysis of Ni-NTA-associated ubiquitin conjugates using an α1-antitrypsin-specific antibody revealed that expression of Herp lacking the UBL domain (HerpΔUBL) led to an inhibition of NHK ubiquitylation when compared with WT-Herp (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 4 and 5). The observed reduction of NHK ubiquitylation was similar to the effect observed upon expression of Hrd1C329S, a RING domain mutant of the E3 (17Kaneko M. Ishiguro M. Niinuma Y. Uesugi M. Nomura Y. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 6 and 7). An increase of endogenous Herp indicated that expression of NHK causes ER stress (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 1 and 2), which is reduced upon coexpression of the ubiquitin construct (Fig. 3A, lane 3). In the presence of Hrd1C329S, further enhancement of endogenous Herp levels is most likely due to impaired Hrd1 function. To validate the data from this experiment, we performed an inverse approach using an α1-antitrypsin-specific antibody to immunoprecipitate NHK from cells that were cotransfected with NHK and a HERP-specific shRNA construct (shHERP) (Fig. 3B). As observed in the previous experiment (Fig. 3A), there is a modest increase in endogenous Herp in the presence of NHK, which is further enhanced upon expression of Hrd1C329S. We found that the shRNA-mediated reduction of Herp levels is accompanied by a decrease in ubiquitylated NHK. Although transfection with HERP-specific shRNA resulted in a reduction of endogenous Herp already at 24 h after transfection (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 2 and 3), it was not sufficient to efficiently inhibit expression of Herp from a plasmid. Therefore, we were able to rescue the shRNA effect by cotransfection of WT-HERP, whereas HERPΔUBL led to a further reduction of ubiquitylated NHK. Differences between ubiquitylation patterns obtained by the different experimental setups are most likely due to the presence of the His tag in the ubiquitin construct used in the approach presented in Fig. 3A. Taken together, the data demonstrate that the UBL domain of Herp is essential for the ubiquitylation of NHK detected upon inhibition of the 26 S proteasome. Furthermore, our data confirm previous reports on the requirement of the Hrd1 activity for the ubiquitylation of NHK (22Christianson J.C. Shaler T.A. Tyler R.E. Kopito R.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 272-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). As ubiquitylation of substrate proteins is necessary for their degradation by the proteasome, requirement of the Herp UBL domain for the ubiquitylation of NHK suggested that it is also important for the degradation of the substrate protein. To prove this hypothesis, we monitored the degradation of NHK upon the addition of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-glycosylation. As NHK is N-glycosylated and tunicamycin prevents this modification, the addition of tunicamycin allowed us to monitor the fate of the glycosylated substrate pool. Treatment of cells with tunicamycin led to a reduction of glycosylated NHK, which was accompanied by an increase of its non-glycosylated form (Fig. 4). To ensure that the observed non-glycosylated NHK species are synthesized de novo after the exposure of cells to tunicamycin, we performed a control experiment in which CHX was used to block translation. Indeed, when protein synthesis was inhibited by CHX, the non-glycosylated form of NHK was not detected. As expected, Herp levels were increased after 4 h of treatment with tunicamycin, whereas inhibition of translation by CHX led to the opposite effect. Inhibition of Herp synthesis with specific shRNA resulted in a stabilization of glycosylated NHK. Cotransfection with WT-HERP restored substrate degradation, whereas cotransfection of HERPΔUBL failed to rescue the shRNA phenotype. In summary, the data confirmed our hypothesis that degradation of glycosylated NHK is dependent on the Herp-UBL domain. Components of the ERAD machinery such as Hrd1 are induced by the UPR to facilitate the disposal of aberrant proteins from the ER (4van Laar T. Schouten T. Hoogervorst E. van Eck M. van der Eb A.J. Terleth C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 5Kokame K. Agarwala K.L. Kato H. Miyata T. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Hrd1 is a central component of membrane-resident ERAD complexes connecting the ubiquitylation of ERAD substrates and their extraction to the cytosol (6Schulze A. Standera S. Buerger E. Kikkert M. van Voorden S. Wiertz E. Koning F. Kloetzel P.M. Seeger M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 10Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A.

Ron D. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 429: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). It therefore seems likely that rapid adaptation of substrate turnover to cellular requirements is achieved predominantly by varying the activity of ERAD complexes that are available at the time, rather than by regulating their abundance. As Herp binds Hrd1 and promotes the ubiquitylation activity of the E3, it is able to act as a regulator of Hrd1-dependent protein degradation. This hypothesis is further supported by our data on the dynamics of the association between Herp and Hrd1 upon exposure of cells to ER stress. Although the increase of Herp levels in cells exposed to ER stress is accompanied by an elevation of Herp-associated Hrd1, the steady state level of total Hrd1 appears to remain unchanged for at least 8 h. In contrast, we observed an increase of Hrd1 synthesis within that period of time. However, it has been reported that HRD1 mRNA expression peaks at 6 h of exposure to ER stress, whereas steady state levels of the Hrd1 protein are elevated only modestly with a peak between 12 and 24 h (20Kaneko M. Yasui S. Niinuma Y. Arai K. Omura T. Okuma Y. Nomura Y. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 5355-5360Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As Hrd1 is a stable protein displaying a half-life of 15 h (19Kikkert M. Doolman R. Dai M. Avner R. Hassink G. van Voorden S. Thanedar S. Roitelman J. Chau V. Wiertz E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3525-3534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), it is likely that the amount of Hrd1 synthesized de novo within 8 h after induction by the UPR is considerably lower than the Hrd1 amount already present in the cell. The consequence is only a minor increase of the Hrd1 steady state level that is not detected in our experiments. As the half-life of Herp is only 2 h (15Sai X. Kokame K. Shiraishi H. Kawamura Y. Miyata T. Yanagisawa K. Komano H. FEBS Lett. 2003; 553: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), its rapid induction by the UPR also leads to the dramatic increase of its steady state levels already 4 h after exposure to ER stress. The enhanced association of Herp with Hrd1 then permits an increase of Hrd1-mediated ubiquitylation. Once the cell has overcome the stress situation, UPR signaling is disabled, which leads to a decrease in Herp-associated Hrd1, allowing a readjustment of Hrd1-dependent ubiquitylation to standard conditions. Considering that Herp is able to bind Hrd1 directly (6Schulze A. Standera S. Buerger E. Kikkert M. van Voorden S. Wiertz E. Koning F. Kloetzel P.M. Seeger M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), the presence of multiple Hrd1 molecules in a single complex may also permit binding of multiple Herp molecules to such a complex. Thus, it is seems possible either that occupation of all Herp-binding sites on a Hrd1 ERAD complex is required for substrate ubiquitylation or that the ubiquitylation activity of the complex is dependent on the number of Herp molecules bound, introducing a further level of regulation. As oligomerization of gp78, a homologue of Hrd1, as well as its yeast counterpart Hrd1p have recently been demonstrated to be crucial for the ubiquitylation of substrate proteins (23Li W. Tu D. Li L.

Previously, it has been shown that when expressed in budding yeast, Herp is able to partially rescue the phenotype caused by the deletion of USA1, although no significant sequence similarity between both proteins was detected (26Carvalho P. Goder V. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 2006; 126: 361-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Similar to Herp, Usa1p also contains a UBL domain and was found to associate with Hrd1p. The partial rescue of Usa1p-deficient cells by Herp can be explained by the requirement of both proteins for ERAD of transmembrane substrates (6Schulze A. Standera S. Buerger E.

However, the UBL domain of Usa1p seems to be dispensable for the ubiquitylation and degradation of soluble ER proteins (24Carroll S.M. Hampton R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 5146-5156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 25Horn S.C. Hanna J. Hirsch C. Volkwein C. Schütz A. Heinemann U. Sommer T. Jarosch E. Mol.

PLoS One. 2009; 4: e7604Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), whereas our data demonstrate that the Herp UBL domain is crucial for the ubiquitylation and degradation of the soluble NHK. In addition, Usa1p is a stable protein that functions as a scaffold, crucial for the integrity of Hrd1p-based complexes (24Carroll S.M. Hampton R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 5146-5156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 25Horn S.C. Hanna J. Hirsch C. Volkwein C. Schütz A. Heinemann U. Sommer T. Jarosch E. Mol.

Thus, Herp and Usa1p differ with respect to these important functions and therefore display only limited functional similarities. Taking into account that the Herp UBL domain is not required for Hrd1 binding (6Schulze A. Standera S. Buerger E. Kikkert M. van Voorden S. Wiertz E. Koning F. Kloetzel P.M. Seeger M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), it is free to interact with other factors, which may be required for the ubiquitylation of specific Hrd1 substrates. Thus, it is conceivable that Herp acts as an adapter protein, enabling Hrd1-mediated ubiquitylation. However, further studies will be required to identify interaction partners of the Herp UBL domain. In conclusion, the current data favor a model in which ER stress induces increased binding of Herp to Hrd1 molecules present in ERAD complexes. This results in enhanced Hrd1-dependent ubiquitylation and rapid disposal of aberrant proteins to prevent the formation of toxic aggregates and apoptotic cell death. We thank M. Kikkert, E.

https://openalex.org/W2147579396,"Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) induces anemia in humans and mice, but it is unclear whether ACE is involved in other aspects of hematopoiesis. Here, we systemically evaluated ACE-knockout (KO) mice and found myelopoietic abnormalities characterized by increased bone marrow myeloblasts and myelocytes, as well as extramedullary myelopoiesis. Peritoneal macrophages from ACE-KO mice were deficient in the production of effector molecules, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-12p40, and CD86 when stimulated with lipopolysaccharide and interferon-γ. ACE-KO mice were more susceptible to Staphylococcus aureus infection. Further studies using total or fractionated bone marrows revealed that ACE regulates myeloid proliferation, differentiation, and functional maturation via angiotensin II and substance P and through the angiotensin II receptor type 1 and substance P neurokinin 1 receptors. Angiotensin II was correlated with CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein-α up-regulation during myelopoiesis. Angiotensin II supplementation of ACE-KO mice rescued macrophage functional maturation. These results demonstrate a previous unrecognized significant role for ACE in myelopoiesis and imply new perspectives for manipulating myeloid cell expansion and maturation."

Although the roles of TopBP1 have been studied mostly in cancer cell lines, its physiological function remains unclear in mice and untransformed cells. We generated conditional knock-out mice in which exons 5 and 6 of the TopBP1 gene are flanked by loxP sequences. Although TopBP1-deficient embryos developed to the blastocyst stage, no homozygous mutant embryos were recovered at E8.5 or beyond, and completely resorbed embryos were frequent at E7.5, indicating that mutant embryos tend to die at the peri-implantation stage. This finding indicated that TopBP1 is essential for cell proliferation during early embryogenesis. Ablation of TopBP1 in TopBP1flox/flox mouse embryonic fibroblasts and 3T3 cells using Cre recombinase-expressing retrovirus arrests cell cycle progression at the G1, S, and G2/M phases. The TopBP1-ablated mouse cells exhibit phosphorylation of H2AX and Chk2, indicating that the cells contain DNA breaks. The TopBP1-ablated mouse cells enter cellular senescence. Although RNA interference-mediated knockdown of TopBP1 induced cellular senescence in human primary cells, it induced apoptosis in cancer cells.

TopBP1 also mediates ATR-mediated Chk1 activation by facilitating the interaction of claspin and Chk1 (19Liu S. Bekker-Jensen S. Mailand N. Lukas C. Bartek J. Lukas J. Mol. Cell.

Furthermore, association of TopBP1 with NBS1 is involved in double-stranded DNA break-induced homologous recombination repair (21Morishima K. Sakamoto S. Kobayashi J. Izumi H. Suda T. Matsumoto Y.

Binding of TopBP1 to E2F1 represses E2F1 proapoptotic activity by recruiting the Brg1·Brm chromatin remodeling complex (22Liu K. Luo Y. Lin F.T. Lin W.C. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 673-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). TopBP1 also binds to the DNA binding domain of p53 and inhibits the promoter binding activity of this protein (23Liu K.

Therefore, TopBP1 depletion derepresses the proapoptotic activity of p53 and E2F1 and induces cellular apoptosis. In addition, TopBP1 represses Miz-1 expression to inhibit p21 expression (24Herold S. Wanzel M. Beuger V. Frohme C. Beul D. Hillukkala T. Syvaoja J. Saluz H.P. Haenel F. Eilers M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 509-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The binding and repression of E2F1 and Miz1 require Akt-dependent oligomerization of TopBP1 (25Liu K. Paik J.C. Wang B. Lin F.T. Lin W.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4795-4807Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Most of the previous studies on the role of TopBP1 in the cell cycle and the DNA damage response have been carried out using human cancer cells. In this study we generated TopBP1 conditional knock-out mice to study the physiological functions of the TopBP1 protein. Inactivation of both TopBP1 alleles led to embryonic lethality at the peri-implantation stage. From TopBP1flox/flox embryos, we prepared mouse embryonic fibroblasts and their immortalized 3T3 cells. Ablation of TopBP1 in these cells using a Cre recombinase-expressing retrovirus produced DNA breakage. This process activated DNA damage response signaling and arrested cell cycle progression, thereby inducing cellular senescence. We also showed that knockdown of TopBP1 in human primary cells by RNA interference caused cellular senescence. A 16.3-kb DNA fragment containing exon 3 and exon 10 of the murine TopBP1 gene was retrieved from BAC clones (bMQ-304N19, Geneservice) into a pBluescript phagemid system according to a previously reported procedure (26Liu P. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 476-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 27Warming S. Costantino N. Court D.L. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e36Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). A 50-bp DNA fragment of the loxP sequence was inserted at the EcoRI restriction site located between exon 4 and 5, and a 1.9-kb neomycin resistance cassette from pL451 (provided by N. Copeland) was inserted at the XbaI restriction site located between exon 6 and 7. The diphtheria toxin A chain cassette was employed as a negative selection marker. The targeting vector was linearized and used for gene targeting in the E14Tg2A ES cell line (129/OlaHsd-derived, Baygenomics). Mouse ES cell culture and electroporation were performed as previously described with the exception of the procedure for neomycin selection (28Zheng P. Schramm R.D. Latham K.E. Biol. Reprod. 2005; 72: 1359-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Correctly targeted ES clones were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts for chimera generation. Chimeric males were bred with C57BL/6 females, and germ line transmission of the TopBP1neo allele was verified by PCR and Southern blots (Fig. 1C). The TopBP1flox (“floxed”) and TopBP1Δ alleles were generated by crossing the TopBP1neo allele with a Flp deleter strain (FLPeR mice, Jackson laboratory strain 003946) and a Cre deleter strain (zp3-Cre, Jackson laboratory strain 003651) (Fig. 1D), respectively. The PCR primers used and genotyping information for the TopBP1 wild-type, floxed, and mutant alleles are provided in supplemental Table S1. All blastocysts were generated by natural mating of TopBP1 heterozygote mice. The morning of the day on which a vaginal plug was detected was designated as day E0.5. Blastocysts were collected on E3.5 by flushing the uterus of each mouse with M2 medium (Sigma) followed by culturing in conditioned ES media (knock-out Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen), 15% FBS (Hyclone), 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 55 μm 2-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen), and 1000 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor (Chemicon) for 0 or 24 h. Overgrowths were photographed on each day and harvested for genotyping (Fig. 1E). Genotyping of embryonic cells was performed as previously described (29Lee H. Lee D.J. Oh S.P. Park H.D. Nam H.H. Kim J.M. Lim D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5373-5381Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The sequences of the PCR primers used and genotype information for the TopBP1 wild-type, floxed, and mutant alleles are provided in supplemental Table S1. For BrdU-treated embryos, blastocysts were rinsed in PBS and fixed in fresh 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. DNA was denatured after permeabilization with 2 n HCl and 0.5% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature and washed extensively in PBS with 1.0% BSA. Blastocysts were incubated with mouse anti-BrdU (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) overnight at 4 °C. Incubation with Alex Fluor 488 (Invitrogen) secondary antibodies was performed for 1 h at 37 °C followed by staining with 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). MEFs were generated from embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) embryos according to standard protocols (30Nash R.A. Caldecott K.W. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5207-5211Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). MEFs were grown in DMEM with 4500 mg/liter d-glucose and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone), 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 55 μm 2-mercaptoethanol in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 and passaged every 2–3 days. All experiments with MEFs were performed with cells that had been subjected to 3–5 passages. The primary MEF cells were immortalized using the 3T3 protocol (31Todaro G.J. Green H. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (2004) Google Scholar). MEF and 3T3 cells thus obtained were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine (Welgene), and 2β-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen). U2OS, HeLa, HS68, IMR90, and PT67 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. PT67 packaging cells containing the retrovirus construct expressing Cre recombinase were generated and cultured with puromycin (3 μg/ml) until confluent. The cells were then incubated in fresh medium without puromycin for 24 h. Supernatant medium was collected and filtered using a 0.45-μm filter. This filtered medium was used to infect MEF and its 3T3 cells. After retroviral infection with Polybrene (6 μg/ml) for 24 h, the virus-infected cells were selected with puromycin (3 μg/ml) for another 24 h. The 3T3 cells were blocked at the G1/S boundary by treatment with 2 mm thymidine for 12 h. After release into fresh medium for 8 h, cells were treated with 2 mm thymidine for an additional 12 h. Nocodazole (100 ng/ml) was added to the cells for 12 h to arrest the cells at the G2/M phase. Cells were trypsinized and then fixed in 70% ethanol at 4 °C. After fixation, the cells were incubated with RNase A (10 μg/ml), Nonidet P-40 (0.05%), and propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) for 1 h. For the BrdU FACS analysis, cells were incubated for 10 min in the presence of BrdU (10 μm). Harvested cells were fixed in 70% ethanol at 4 °C and denatured in 2 n HCl, 0.5% Triton X-100 for 1 h. The cells were then neutralized with 0.1 m Na2B4O7 (pH 8.5) and incubated with BrdU antibody and FITC-conjugated secondary antibody in PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.5% Tween 20 for 1 h each. Cells were stained with propidium iodide solution and then analyzed using the FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences). Anti-TopBP1 polyclonal antibody was raised against the TopBP1 fragment corresponding to amino acids 1019–1167 (12Jeon Y. Lee K.Y. Ko M.J. Lee Y.S. Kang S. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14882-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The antibody to BrdU was obtained from Abcam. The antibodies to phospho-H2AX (Ser139), phospho-Chk1 (Ser137), and phospho-Chk2 (Thr68) were obtained from Cell Signaling. The antibody to β-actin was obtained from Sigma. Cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for an additional 20 min. After treatment with each primary and secondary antibody, coverslips were mounted on glass slides with mounting media containing 1 μg/ml DAPI (Vectashield). SA-β-Gal staining was performed using a SA-β-Gal staining kit (#9860; Cell Signaling) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequences of the synthesized siRNA oligonucleotides (Samchully Pharm Co.) were previously described (12Jeon Y. Lee K.Y. Ko M.J. Lee Y.S. Kang S. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14882-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar): TopBP1 #2, ACCGAGUACGCCACUCUCA, and control siRNA (GL3), CUUACGCUGAGUACUUCGATT. Cells were transfected with siRNAs using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To explore the physiological functions of TopBP1 in embryo development and adult tissues, we generated a conditional TopBP1 allele by gene targeting in mouse ES cells (Fig. 1). The murine TopBP1 gene, located on chromosome 9F1, is distributed over about 45 kb and is composed of 28 exons with a potential translational start codon in exon 2 (as determined from NCBI annotation of NCBI Build 37). In our gene targeting strategy, exons 5 and 6 were flanked by two loxP sequences that are recognized and removed by Cre recombinase. Consequently, only the first 121 of the entire 1515 amino acids of TopBP1 are correctly translated after the frameshift mutation and generation of a null allele. The TopBP1-targeting construct was electroporated into 129P2/OlaHsd-derived E14K ES cells, and neomycin-resistant clones were screened for homologous recombination by Southern blotting with 5′ external probes and EcoRV digestion (Fig. 1, A and B). Of 196 neomycin-resistant cell lines, 18 (9.1%) displayed the desired target. Correctly targeted ES cell clones were used to derive chimeric mice that transmitted the TopBP1neo allele through the germ line (Fig. 1C). TopBP1+/flox mice were generated as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1D). TopBP1flox/flox mice were viable, fertile, and did not show any abnormalities. The expression levels of TopBP1 in TopBP1flox/flox MEFs were found to be similar to the expression levels observed in the wild-type mouse (Fig. 1F), implying that the TopBP1flox allele does not exert a significant effect on the expression of the protein. Furthermore, the level of TopBP1 protein was found to be higher during early embryogenesis (e.g. ES cell and E9.5) than during late embryogenesis. Furthermore, the level of TopBP1 protein was found to be higher in progenitor cells than in differentiated cells (MEF) (Fig. 1F). These expression patterns of TopBP1 suggest the possibility that the protein is involved in cell proliferation or that it functions in the undifferentiated state. The expression level of TopBP1 in TopBP1+/Δ MEFs suggests that the TopBP1Δ allele is defective in TopBP1 expression (Fig. 1F). However, heterozygous TopBP1+/Δ mice were apparently normal, healthy, and fertile. There were no developmental abnormalities detected during a 15-month observation period. In contrast, homozygous TopBP1Δ/Δ mice were not produced of 168 live births from TopBP1+/Δ intercrosses (supplemental Table S2), indicating that inactivation of both alleles leads to embryonic lethality. To assess the specific period of TopBP1 knock-out-induced developmental failure, timed heterozygous mating was performed. Embryos or fetuses were collected after various gestation periods, and their genotypes were determined by PCR (Fig. 2A and supplemental Table S2). No homozygous mutant embryos/fetuses were recovered at 8.5 or beyond, and embryos tended to be completely resorbed at E7.5. When blastocysts were recovered at E3.5 from heterozygote intercrosses, 34.9% (72/206) of the total embryos were found to be homozygous TopBP1Δ/Δ. The mutant embryos followed Mendel's law and could not be morphologically distinguished from wild-type and heterozygous embryos. These data indicate that TopBP1-deficient embryos normally develop to the blastocyst stage but die at the peri-implantation stage. To characterize the growth defects of TopBP1-deficient embryos, blastocysts recovered at E3.5 were cultured in vitro for several days (Fig. 2B). After culturing for 3–4 days, spherical blastocysts became flattened on the culture dish and formed a multicomponent structure in which the inner cell mass grew as a round shape on top of the extra-embryonic trophoblast giant cells (32Nowak R.A. Haimovici F. Biggers J.D. Erbach G.T. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In these cultures heterozygous TopBP1+/Δ and wild-type embryonic cells normally developed into inner cell mass and trophoblast giant cells. Although homozygous TopBP1Δ/Δ embryos apparently showed normal growth for 24 h, the embryos did not grow any further after the point when normal embryos hatched. The mutant embryos did not hatch and exhibited morphological shrinkage. Furthermore, we frequently observed complete resorption of the embryos into the uterus at E7.5 (Fig. 2C). These results collectively suggest that homozygous TopBP1Δ/Δ embryos exhibit growth defects after E4.5 and then die at the peri-implantation stage. We employed the in vitro cultures of blastocysts to examine whether the developmental failure of mutant embryos at the peri-implantation stage resulted from cell proliferation defects. The proliferation of embryonic cells was measured by the BrdU incorporation assay, which detects proliferative activity of the cells by measuring DNA synthesis (Fig. 3). In this assay, 45–60% of the BrdU-positive cells were detected in wild-type embryos at E3.5, 4.0, and E4.5. On the other hand, less than 15% of the BrdU-positive cells were detected in TopBP1-null embryos at E3.5, and most of the mutant embryos did not exhibit BrdU-positive cells at E4.5. At this point, the TopBP1-null embryos did not develop further and appeared to shrink or die. The presence of fragmented DNA, which is an indication of apoptotic cells, was detected by staining of TopBP1-null embryos cultured in vitro with DAPI (supplemental Fig. S1). Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining confirmed that cell death occurred in TopBPΔ/Δ embryos at E4.0 (supplemental Fig. S1). In contrast, the TUNEL-positive cells were rarely detected in wild-type littermates. These results suggest that the dramatic reduction of proliferating cells accompanied by cell death at least in part induces the developmental failure of TopBP1-null embryos. The function of TopBP1 in the cell cycle has been addressed using TopBP1-depleted cancer cells such as HeLa and U2OS, with RNA interference (RNAi) (12Jeon Y. Lee K.Y. Ko M.J. Lee Y.S. Kang S.

As an alternative, we analyzed the loss of TopBP1 function using TopBP1flox/flox mouse embryonic fibroblast cells prepared from TopBP1flox/flox mice and their immortalized 3T3 cells. Infection of these cells with a retrovirus, which expresses Cre recombinase (Cre-retrovirus), was found to ablate the expression of TopBP1 protein in TopBP1flox/flox MEF and 3T3 cells (Fig. 4). At the indicated time after the infection, TopBP1 protein levels were examined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4A). In contrast to the wild-type cells, most of the TopBP1 protein was depleted in TopBP1flox/flox cells 48 h after the viral infection. Consistently, as TopBP1 was being depleted, TopBP1 disappeared from the nucleus of TopBP1flox/flox cells (supplemental Fig. S2), although TopBP1 protein is located in the nucleus of wild-type cells during interphase (35Mäkiniemi M. Hillukkala T. Tuusa J. Reini K. Vaara M. Huang D. Pospiech H. Majuri I. Westerling T. Mäkelä T.P. Syväoja J.E. J. Biol.

Biol. 2003; 23: 3287-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). FACS analysis of TopBP1-ablated cells indicates a reduction of G1-phase cells containing 2N DNA and a reduction of S-phase cells as well as an increase of G2/M-phase cells containing 4N DNA content (Fig. 4B), relative to wild-type cells. To differentiate the cells that undergo normal cell cycle progression from the cells that are arrested in each cell cycle phase, Cre-retrovirus-infected cells were subjected to a double thymidine block or treatment with nocodazole, which arrests cells at the G1/S boundary with 2N DNA content or at prometaphase of mitosis with 4N DNA content, respectively. Whereas the double thymidine block arrested the cell cycle progression of wild-type cells at the G1/S boundary with 2N DNA content, the FACS analysis indicated that the TopBP1-ablated cells yield a significant population of cells containing 4N DNA. The 4N DNA-containing cells undergo arrest of cell cycle progression in the G2 or M phase. Anti-phosphohistone H3 (Ser10) antibody detects both the late G2 and M phase cells, which can be discriminated by their chromosome and nuclear morphologies (37Dunn K.L. Davie J.R. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 3492-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 38Hendzel M.J. Wei Y. Mancini M.A. Van Hooser A. Ranalli T. Brinkley B.R. Bazett-Jones D.P. Allis C.D. Chromosoma. 1997; 106: 348-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar). Most of TopBP1-ablated 4N cells appeared to be arrested in the late G2 phase (supplemental Fig. S3). Nocodazole treatment of TopBP1-ablated cells produced a higher population of cells containing 2N DNA than the wild-type cells. This implies that the 2N DNA-containing cells were arrested in the G1 phase. As TopBP1 is depleted, BrdU incorporation, which provides an indication of DNA synthesis of proliferating cells, became decreased in the TopBP1-ablated cells (Fig. 4C). Although after 120 h, 27% of the TopBP1-ablated cells were in the S-phase, only 12% of the cells were positive with respect to BrdU incorporation. On the other hand, most of the control S-phase cells had incorporated BrdU. The lower level of BrdU incorporation in the S-phase cells suggests that the cells were not replicating and had undergone cell cycle arrest in the S phase. Inconsistent with the defect of TopBP1-ablated cells in cell cycle progression, the TopBP1-ablated cells did not proliferate (Fig. 4D). These results suggest that the TopBP1-ablated cells undergo cell cycle arrest in G1, S, G2, or M phase. It is likely that the phase in which arrest occurs depends upon the time required for TopBP1 level to fall below the threshold level necessary for progression through each stage of the cell cycle. When TopBP1 was depleted by TopBP1-specific siRNAs in cancer cells, the depletion was found to induce phosphorylation of H2AX and activation of the ATM-Chk2 DNA damage pathway even in the absence of external genotoxic stress (34Kim J.E. McAvoy S.A. Smith D.I. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10907-10915Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Because DNA breaks induce H2AX phosphorylation (denoted as γH2AX), which forms foci at the region of the DNA break, the formation of the γH2AX foci together with the activation of the ATM-Chk2 pathway indicates that the TopBP1 knockdown induces the breakage of DNA. These observations suggest that TopBP1 is necessary for maintaining genome integrity. By detecting phosphorylated H2AX and Chk2 using corresponding phospho-specific antibodies, we examined the activation of DNA damage responses of TopBP1-ablated MEFs and 3T3 cells. At a point 72 h after infection with the Cre-retrovirus, the ablation induced increases in the rate of phosphorylation and formation of foci of γH2AX and Chk2 in TopBP1flox/flox cells (Fig. 5, A and B, and supplemental Fig. S4). In response to genotoxic stress, TopBP1 activates Chk1 not only by directly interacting with ATR·ATRIP but also by facilitating activation of claspin and potentiating its ability to bind Chk1 (19Liu S. Bekker-Jensen S. Mailand N. Lukas C. Bartek J. Lukas J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6056-6064Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 39Garcia V. Furuya K. Carr A.M. DNA Repair. 2005; 4: 1227-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Upon UV radiation, the Chk1 phosphorylation of Cre-retrovirus-infected cells was examined (Fig. 5C). Although the radiation increased the rate of phosphorylation of γH2AX and Chk1 in wild-type cells, Chk1 phosphorylation maintained background levels in the TopBP1-depleted cells. The lack of activation of Chk1 confirmed the previous findings that TopBP1 function is necessary for the activation of Chk1 in response to DNA damage (19Liu S. Bekker-Jensen S. Mailand N. Lukas C. Bartek J. Lukas J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6056-6064Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 34Kim J.E. McAvoy S.A. Smith D.I. Chen J. Mol. Cell.

As reported previously (34Kim J.E. McAvoy S.A. Smith D.I. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10907-10915Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), TopBP1 depletion increased the number of abnormal nuclei in cells containing binuclei or micronuclei (Fig. 5D and supplemental Fig. S5). Even in the absence of external genotoxic stress, TopBP1-deficient cells were found to exhibit DNA breaks and activation of Chk2. The DNA breaks detected by γH2AX in the cells persisted for at least 10 days after infection with Cre-retrovirus. This suggests that DNA damage could not be repaired regardless of whether the DNA damage repair mechanism was operating properly (Fig. 6A). Although TopBP1 knockdown by RNA interference induced apoptosis in cancer cells (12Jeon Y. Lee K.Y. Ko M.J. Lee Y.S. Kang S. Hwang D.S. J. Biol.

Wu X. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), we were not able to detect significant cell death of TopBP1-ablated MEF or 3T3 cells. Instead, TopBP1-ablated cells underwent morphological changes including enlargement and flattening of the cells on the culture dishes (Fig. 6B). At a point 10 days after infection with Cre-retrovirus, the nuclear size of the TopBP1-ablated cells increased by as much as 3–4-fold relative to the wild-type cells. The TopBP1 ablation also increased the cellular granularity of the harvested cells (Fig. 6C). These morphological changes are the typical phenotypes of senescent cells (40Chen Q.M. Tu V.C. Catania J. Burton M. Toussaint O. Dilley T. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4087-4097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Hwang E.S. Yoon G. Kang H.T. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66: 2503-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Consistent with these morphological changes, TopBP1-ablated cells were positive with respect to SA-β-gal staining, which detects senescent cells (Fig. 6D). Taken together, the results indicate that TopBP1 ablation induces cellular senescence in mouse MEF and 3T3 cells. We examined whether TopBP1 deficiency causes cellular senescence in human cells. Using TopBP1-specific siRNA (12Jeon Y. Lee K.Y. Ko M.J. Lee Y.S. Kang S. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14882-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), TopBP1 knockdown was carried out in human IMR90 and HS68 primary cells and human HeLa and U2OS cancer cells (Fig. 7). Three days after the siRNA transfections, the human primary cells exhibited generation of DNA breaks detected by phosphorylation of H2AX and Chk2 with the reduction of BrdU-incorporated cells (Fig. 7B and supplemental Fig. S6). At 7 days after the continuous knockdown, most of the human primary cells became senescent. On the other hand, the cancer cell lines were negative for SA-β-gal staining and were observed to undergo apoptosis (Fig. 7C). These results indicate that TopBP1 deficiency also causes cellular senescence in human primary cells in a manner similar to the senescence observed for mouse cells. In this study we generated and characterized a conditional knock-out mutation in the mouse TopBP1 gene. The TopBP1flox allele was found to be comparable with that of the wild-type allele, and deletion of TopBP1 exons 5 and 6 produced a null allele suitable for determining the roles of TopBP1 in vivo and in primary cells (Fig. 1F). TopBP1-deficient embryos indicate a critical and non-redundant function for TopBP1 during murine peri-implantation development. This conclusion is supported by the following observations; (a) TopBP1 is highly expressed in ES and early embryonic cells (Fig. 1F), (b) about 20% of embryos at E7.5 were fully resorbed (Fig. 2C), and (c) whereas TopBP1Δ/Δ blastocysts recovered at E3.5 were detected at the expected Mendelian ratio (supplemental Table S2) and were morphologically indistinguishable from wild-type, inner cell mass and trophoblast giant cells did not grow upon outgrowth of blastocysts (Fig. 2B). The dramatic reduction of BrdU incorporation in the mutant embryo followed by the observation of cell death suggests that a defect in cell proliferation causes the developmental failure. It has been reported that TopBP1 is present in mammalian oocytes and is involved in a meiotic recombination checkpoint (28Zheng P. Schramm R.D. Latham K.E. Biol. Reprod. 2005; 72: 1359-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 42Perera D. Perez-Hidalgo L. Moens P.B. Reini K. Lakin N. Syväoja J.E. San-Segundo P.A. Freire R. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 2009; 20: 2351-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Also, TopBP1 is highly expressed during early embryogenesis (Fig. 1F). Therefore, the survival of TopBP1-deficient cells to the blastocyst stage suggests that maternal TopBP1 mRNA and/or protein are sufficient to sustain the TopBP1 level through several cell divisions in mutant embryos during early embryogenesis. However, it appears that TopBP1 is depleted at the blastocyst stage, leading to embryonic cell death, as supported by the result shown in Fig. 4C, which indicates that comparable BrdU incorporation in mutant MEFs is sustained until 72 h after TopBP1 ablation. The functions of TopBP1 in the initiation of chromosome replication, replication fork checkpoint, and DNA damage checkpoint support our proposal that TopBP1 ablation in the mouse MEF cells causes G1 arrest with 2N DNA or DNA replication failure in S phase cells. The failure to complete chromosome replication and DNA damage can lead to arrest of the TopBP1-deficient cells in the G2 phase with 4N DNA content. Also, the DNA breakage taken placed by TopBP1 deficiency can contribute to such defects in the cell cycle progression. TopBP1-depleted cancer cells using siRNA accumulated the cells containing DNA breaks and 4N DNA (34Kim J.E. McAvoy S.A. Smith D.I. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10907-10915Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) or G1 arrest cells without DNA damage (12Jeon Y. Lee K.Y. Ko M.J. Lee Y.S. Kang S. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14882-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The functions of TopBP1 support our proposal that TopBP1-deficient cells arrest the cell cycle at each cell cycle phase when TopBP1 is lowered below the threshold level necessary for the progression of each cell phase. TopBP1 knockdown using siRNAs in cancer cells induces apoptosis (12Jeon Y. Lee K.Y. Ko M.J. Lee Y.S. Kang S. Hwang D.S. J. Biol.

Smith D.I. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10907-10915Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). TopBP1 recruits Brg1·Brm to E2F1-responsive promoters and inhibits E2F1 transcriptional activity, which represses E2F1-mediated apoptosis during the G1/S transition of the cell cycle (22Liu K. Luo Y. Lin F.T. Lin W.C. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 673-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Similarly, depletion of TopBP1 up-regulates p53 target genes involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, thereby inducing DNA damage-induced apoptosis because interaction of TopBP1 with the p53 DNA binding domain inhibits the binding of p53 to the promoters (23Liu K. Bellam N. Lin H.Y. Wang B. Stockard C.R. Grizzle W.E. Lin W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 2673-2693Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These results explain why TopBP1 knockdown induces apoptosis in cancer cells. Although TopBP1 depleted mouse MEFs and 3T3 cells were found to exhibit phenotypes similar to the phenotypes of cancer cells subjected to TopBP1-knockdown, such as generation of DNA breaks, activation of the Chk2 pathway, and inactivation of the Chk1 pathway under UV radiation, the TopBP1-depleted MEFs were found to induce cellular senescence rather than apoptosis. Furthermore, prolonged knockdown of TopBP1 by the addition of siRNA against TopBP1 also triggers cellular senescence in human primary cells. When DNA damage is severe, cells either undergo apoptosis to remove damaged cells from a cell population or initiate cellular senescence that leads to irreversible cell cycle arrest (44d'Adda di Fagagna F. Nat. Rev Cancer. 2008; 8: 512-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). The cell type and the intensity, duration, and nature of the damage may decide whether apoptosis or cellular senescence occurs. We thank N.

https://openalex.org/W2060018494,"All members of the kinesin superfamily of molecular motors contain an unusual structural motif consisting of an α-helix that is interrupted by a flexible loop, referred to as L5. We have examined the function of L5 in the mitotic kinesin Eg5 by combining site-directed mutagenesis of L5 with transient state kinetics, molecular dynamics simulations, and docking using cryo electron microscopy density. We find that mutation of a proline residue located at a turn within this loop profoundly slows nucleotide-induced structural changes both at the catalytic site as well as at the microtubule binding domain and the neck linker. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that this mutation affects the dynamics not only of L5 itself but also of the switch I structural elements that sense ATP binding to the catalytic site. Our results lead us to propose that L5 regulates the rate of conformational change in key elements of the nucleotide binding site through its interactions with α3 and in so doing controls the speed of movement and force generation in kinesin motors."

https://openalex.org/W1984105675,"Most amyloids are pathological, but fragments of Pmel17 form a functional amyloid in vertebrate melanosomes essential for melanin synthesis and deposition. We previously reported that only at the mildly acidic pH (4-5.5) typical of melanosomes, the repeat domain (RPT) of human Pmel17 can form amyloid in vitro. Combined with the known presence of RPT in the melanosome filaments and the requirement of this domain for filament formation, we proposed that RPT may be the core of the amyloid formed in vivo. Although most of Pmel17 is highly conserved across a broad range of vertebrates, the RPT domains vary dramatically, with no apparent homology in some cases. Here, we report that the RPT domains of mouse and zebrafish, as well as a small splice variant of human Pmel17, all form amyloid specifically at mildly acid pH (pH ∼5.0). Protease digestion, mass per unit length measurements, and solid-state NMR experiments suggest that amyloid of the mouse RPT has an in-register parallel β-sheet architecture with two RPT molecules per layer, similar to amyloid of the Aβ peptide. Although there is no sequence conservation between human and zebrafish RPT, amyloid formation at acid pH is conserved."
https://openalex.org/W2068161156,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the key components of the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway that repairs DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are yeast Ku (yKu), Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2, Dnl4-Lif1, and Nej1. Here, we examined the role of Nej1 in NHEJ by a combination of molecular genetic and biochemical approaches. As expected, the recruitment of Nej1 to in vivo DSBs is dependent upon yKu. Surprisingly, Nej1 is required for the stable binding of yKu to in vivo DSBs, in addition to Dnl4-Lif1. Thus, Nej1 and Dnl4-Lif1 are independently recruited by yKu to in vivo DSBs, forming a stable ternary complex that channels DSBs into the NHEJ pathway. In accord with these results, purified Nej1 interacts with yKu and preferentially binds to DNA ends bound by yKu. Furthermore, the binding of a mixture of Nej1 and Dnl4-Lif1 to DNA ends bound by yKu is greater than the sum of the binding of the individual proteins, indicating that pairwise interactions among yKu, Nej1, and Dnl4-Lif1 contribute to complex assembly at DNA ends. Nej1 stimulates intermolecular ligation by Dnl4-Lif1, but, more interestingly, the addition of Nej1 results in more than one intermolecular ligation per Dnl4 molecule. Thus, Nej1 not only plays an important role in determining repair pathway choice by participating in the initial NHEJ complex formed at DSBs but also contributes to the reactivation of Dnl4-Lif1 after repair is complete, thereby increasing the capacity of the NHEJ repair pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2107009504,"Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) encompass some of the most abundant macromolecules on the surface of almost every cell type. Heparan sulfate (HS) chains provide a key interaction surface for the binding of numerous proteins such as growth factors and morphogens, helping to define the ability of a cell to respond selectively to environmental cues. The specificity of HS-protein interactions are governed predominantly by the order and positioning of sulfate groups, with distinct cell types expressing unique sets of HS epitopes. Embryos deficient in HS-synthesis (Ext1−/−) exhibit pre-gastrulation lethality and lack recognizable organized mesoderm and extraembryonic tissues. Here we demonstrate that embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derived from Ext1−/− embryos are unable to differentiate into hematopoietic lineages, instead retaining ESC marker expression throughout embryoid body (EB) culture. However hematopoietic differentiation can be restored by the addition of soluble heparin. Consistent with specific size and composition requirements for HS:growth factor signaling, chains measuring at least 12 saccharides were required for partial rescue of hematopoiesis with longer chains (18 saccharides or more) required for complete rescue. Critically N- and 6-O-sulfate groups were essential for rescue. Heparin addition restored the activity of multiple signaling pathways including bone morphogenic protein (BMP) with activation of phospho-SMADs re-established by the addition of heparin. Heparin addition to wild-type cultures also altered the outcome of differentiation, promoting hematopoiesis at low concentrations, yet inhibiting blood formation at high concentrations. Thus altering the levels of HS and HS sulfation within differentiating ESC cultures provides an attractive and accessible mechanism for influencing cell fate.

Embryos deficient in HS-synthesis (Ext1−/−) exhibit pre-gastrulation lethality and lack recognizable organized mesoderm and extraembryonic tissues. Here we demonstrate that embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derived from Ext1−/− embryos are unable to differentiate into hematopoietic lineages, instead retaining ESC marker expression throughout embryoid body (EB) culture. However hematopoietic differentiation can be restored by the addition of soluble heparin. Consistent with specific size and composition requirements for HS:growth factor signaling, chains measuring at least 12 saccharides were required for partial rescue of hematopoiesis with longer chains (18 saccharides or more) required for complete rescue. Critically N- and 6-O-sulfate groups were essential for rescue. Heparin addition restored the activity of multiple signaling pathways including bone morphogenic protein (BMP) with activation of phospho-SMADs re-established by the addition of heparin. Heparin addition to wild-type cultures also altered the outcome of differentiation, promoting hematopoiesis at low concentrations, yet inhibiting blood formation at high concentrations. Thus altering the levels of HS and HS sulfation within differentiating ESC cultures provides an attractive and accessible mechanism for influencing cell fate. Cells have adopted elaborate systems to identify growth factor and morphogen cues in order to elicit an appropriate response throughout embryonic development and adulthood. A key component of this process is the sugar polymer heparan sulfate (HS), 2The abbreviations used are HS, heparan sulfate; HSPG, heparan sulfate proteoglycans; ESC, embryonic stem cells; GlcA, glucuronic acid; IduA, iduronic acid; EB, embryoid body. which coats the outer surface of almost every cell within the body enabling the selective detection of environmental signals. HS polymerization is catalyzed by a heterodimer consisting of EXT1 and EXT2 enzymes resulting in the addition of alternating glucuronic acid (GlcA) and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues. This backbone is then enzymatically modified by de-N-acetylation and N-sulfation of selected GlcNAc residues to form N-sulfoglucosamine (GlcNS), epimerization of a subset of GlcA residues to iduronic acid (IdoUA) and the addition of sulfate groups at the 2-O-position of GlcA/IdoUA and 6-O- and rarely 3-O-position of GlcNS/GlcNAc. Modification is highly regulated and not complete, forming a cell-type specific pattern of highly sulfated domains (S-domains) interspersed by unmodified regions with the length, position and patterning of sulfate groups ultimately determining HS:ligand binding. The related GAG heparin is virtually fully sulfated along its length. Targeted disruption of Ext1 or Ext2 demonstrates the essential requirement for HS during early development, with lethality in HS-deficient embryos prior to E8.5 because of defective gastrulation (1Lin X.

Development. 2005; 132: 5055-5068Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Although primitive streak formation is initiated by a small percentage of embryos, they fail to form recognizable mesoderm and extraembryonic tissues. Ext1−/− and Ext1+/− ESCs have been obtained from E3.5 blastocysts (1Lin X. Wei G. Shi Z. Dryer L. Esko J.D. Wells D.E. Matzuk M.M. Dev. Biol. 2000; 224: 299-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Following induction of spontaneous differentiation, Ext1−/− ESCs showed a delay or absence of both endoderm and mesoderm markers (1Lin X. Wei G. Shi Z. Dryer L. Esko J.D. Wells D.E. Matzuk M.M. Dev. Biol. 2000; 224: 299-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Furthermore, differentiation of Ext1−/− ESCs into neuroectodermal precursors is defective (3Johnson C.E. Crawford B.E. Stavridis M. Ten Dam G. Wat A.L. Rushton G. Ward C.M. Wilson V. van Kuppevelt T.H. Esko J.D. Smith A. Gallagher J.T. Merry C.L. Stem Cells. 2007; 25: 1913-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Recently, ESCs have been derived from Ext1flox/flox embryos and following LIF withdrawal these ESCs showed a complete absence of markers of differentiation (4Kraushaar D.C. Yamaguchi Y. Wang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 5907-5916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). During development all three germ layers are formed from the primitive ectoderm in a process known as gastrulation:epiblast cells are recruited to the primitive streak where they undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition generating mesoderm and definitive endoderm (5Tam P.P. Behringer R.R. Mech. Dev. 1997; 68: 3-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Newly formed mesoderm subsequently migrates away from the streak and is patterned into distinct developmental populations. The first cells specified form the yolk sac, the initial site of embryonic hematopoiesis initiated by a common precursor known as the hemangioblast (6Huber T.L. Kouskoff V. Fehling H.J. Palis J. Keller G. Nature. 2004; 432: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). This developmental pathway can be recreated in vitro using ESCs differentiated in embryoid bodies (EBs) (7Keller G. Kennedy M. Papayannopoulou T. Wiles M.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 473-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 8Palis J. Robertson S. Kennedy M. Wall C. Keller G. Development. 1999; 126: 5073-5084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereby cells within the EB progressively mature via an epiblast-like state to mesodermal precursors before the hemangioblast is established (9Kouskoff V.

The hemangioblast, identifiable by expression of mesodermal transcription factor Brachyury, together with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) Flk1, can give rise to primitive and definitive hematopoiesis, smooth muscle, and endothelium upon further differentiation (6Huber T.L. Kouskoff V. Fehling H.J. Palis J. Keller G. Nature. 2004; 432: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 10Fehling H.J. Lacaud G. Kubo A. Kennedy M. Robertson S. Keller G. Kouskoff V. Development. 2003; 130: 4217-4227Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In serum-containing EB culture differentiation is rapid, with Brachyury+/Flk1+ hemangioblasts visible from day 2.5 to 3, and more mature CD34+/CD41+ hematopoietic precursors evident from day 5, supplying an ideal model to study hematopoietic development in vitro. A number of studies aimed at establishing the growth factors involved in mesodermal/hematopoietic specification have identified multiple pathways, including members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGFs), Wingless (Wnt), BMP, and transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) families, all of which are expressed within or adjacent to the region where the primitive streak will form and/or by cells within the developing yolk sac (11Conlon F.L.

Recent in vitro studies support the role for these factors. BMP4 signaling via pSMAD1/5/8 was shown to be important for induction of transcription factors characteristic of ventral-posterior mesoderm (Brachyury, Mesp, cdx1), and to induce Flk1 expression from pre-formed mesoderm (14Lengerke C. Schmitt S. Bowman T.V. Jang I.H. Maouche-Chretien L. McKinney-Freeman S. Davidson A.J. Hammerschmidt M. Rentzsch F. Green J.B. Zon L.I. Daley G.Q.

Development. 2008; 135: 1525-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Other groups report that addition of Wnt3a and Activin A can induce primitive streak formation marked by Brachyury expression, with inhibitor studies suggesting Activin A, Wnt3a and BMP4 are all required for Flk1+ mesoderm formation (12Gadue P. Huber T.L. Paddison P.J. Keller G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16806-16811Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 17Nostro M.C. Cheng X. Keller G.M. Gadue P. Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 60-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In addition, Activin A and FGF2 also induce Flk1+ cells from BMP4-induced Brachyury+ mesoderm (16Pearson S. Sroczynska P. Lacaud G. Kouskoff V. Development. 2008; 135: 1525-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In serum-containing EB cultures pSMAD1/5/8 activation is seen at the point of Brachyury/Flk1 induction and Smad6 overexpression (which acts to inhibit Smad1 signaling) decreases the number of Flk1+ cells (15Park C. Afrikanova I. Chung Y.S. Zhang W.J. Arentson E. Fong Gh G. Rosendahl A. Choi K. Development. 2004; 131: 2749-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Using reporter assays, activation of the Wnt pathway, most likely via Wnt3a and 8, is seen from day 2.5 to 3.5 and expression of TGFβ-family member Nodal is seen at days 2 to 3, consistent with their putative roles (18Lindsley R.C. Gill J.G. Kyba M. Murphy T.L. Murphy K.M. Development. 2006; 133: 3787-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). HS can bind and modulate the activity of an extensive range of ligands, leading to the proposed role for HS in the simultaneous coordination of multiple signaling factors. The activities of all the factors discussed above are influenced by HS. Thus to investigate the requirement for HS in directed mesodermal differentiation we tested the ability of Ext1−/− and Ext1+/− cells to differentiate into hemangioblast and hematopoietic precursors. Although Ext1−/− cells expressed mesoderm-specific transcription factor Brachyury, no further differentiation to the hemangioblast stage was observed, with cells retaining expression of ES markers (Oct4, SSEA-1, CD31, and cKit). However differentiation could be restored by the addition of soluble heparin/HS with specific size and composition requirements required for activity. We present evidence to suggest that the differentiation defect in Ext1−/− cells is, at least in part, due to an impaired response to BMP4, highlighting a critical role for HS as a co-receptor in the BMP4 signaling pathway. Addition of heparin to wild-type cells also altered the outcome of differentiation, suggesting that the application of exogenous GAG offers a novel mechanism for influencing ESC fate. Ext1−/− and Ext1+/− ESCs were provided by Jeff Esko/Dan Wells (University of California, San Diego) (1Lin X. Wei G. Shi Z. Dryer L. Esko J.D. Wells D.E. Matzuk M.M. Dev. Biol. 2000; 224: 299-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Matched 129Sv wild-type ESCs were generated in house. ESCs were maintained on irradiated feeder cells, and transferred to gelatin for two passages prior to EB generation as described previously (19Baldwin R.J. ten Dam G.B. van Kuppevelt T.H. Lacaud G. Gallagher J.T. Kouskoff V. Merry C.L. Stem Cells. 2008; 26: 3108-3118Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recombinant mouse Noggin/Fc chimera (0.2 μg/ml, R&D systems, Abingdon, UK) and SB431542 (10 μm, Tocris, Bristol, UK) were dissolved in DMSO and added at day 0 alongside a DMSO alone control. Heparin, HS (pig mucosa, containing both low- and high-sulfated species), CS, DS, selectively desulfated heparin and sized heparin fragments (all from Iduron, Manchester, UK) or organon HS (gift from Organon Co., Oss, The Netherlands) were added at day 0 at 1 μg/ml unless stated. Heparinases I/II/III (Iduron) were used at 5 mIU each. Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy mini kit including a DNase step (Qiagen, Crawley, UK). 2 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using oligo-dT and AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Southampton, UK). PCR was performed as described previously (19Baldwin R.J. ten Dam G.B. van Kuppevelt T.H. Lacaud G. Gallagher J.T. Kouskoff V. Merry C.L. Stem Cells. 2008; 26: 3108-3118Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For primer sequences see supplemental Table S1. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and prepared for staining as described previously (3Johnson C.E. Crawford B.E. Stavridis M. Ten Dam G. Wat A.L. Rushton G. Ward C.M. Wilson V. van Kuppevelt T.H. Esko J.D. Smith A. Gallagher J.T. Merry C.L. Stem Cells. 2007; 25: 1913-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Antibodies used are detailed in supplemental Table S2. Cells were harvested using cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK), and processed for flow cytometry as detailed previously (19Baldwin R.J. ten Dam G.B. van Kuppevelt T.H. Lacaud G. Gallagher J.T. Kouskoff V. Merry C.L. Stem Cells. 2008; 26: 3108-3118Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Antibodies used are detailed in supplemental Table S2. Cells were mixed into methylcellulose-containing medium with specific growth factors and cytokines to promote the growth of either hemangioblast or hematopoietic cell as described previously (19Baldwin R.J. ten Dam G.B. van Kuppevelt T.H. Lacaud G. Gallagher J.T. Kouskoff V. Merry C.L. Stem Cells. 2008; 26: 3108-3118Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Blast colonies were scored at day 5 and hematopoietic colonies were counted at day 6 (primitive erythrocytes) and day 9 (definitive precursors containing one or more myeloid lineages with or without erythrocytes). Results are representative of at least three independent experiments. ESCs were plated for 24 h in serum-free KO-DMEM (Invitrogen), before supplementation with 0–20 ng/ml BMP4 (R&D Systems) for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.27 m sucrose, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche, Burgess Hill, UK), pH7.5) determining protein concentration using BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). Cells were harvested and protein extracted as above. 20 μg of total protein was separated using reduced SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane as described previously (20Ward C.M. Barrow K. Woods A.M. Stern P.L. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4533-4542Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Antibodies used are detailed in supplemental Table S2. The membrane was developed by enhanced chemiluminescence and visualized using film (Amersham Biosciences). Ext1−/− ESCs were readily maintained in culture forming optically bright colonies with typical ES morphology, although colonies phenotypically appeared more compact than wild-type, with little visible differentiation (Fig. 1A). Similar to wild-type, Ext1−/− ESCs stain positive for ESC marker Oct4 and present a high nucleus to cytoplasm ratio with minimal actin cytoskeleton visible (Fig. 1B). To confirm the absence of HS chains at the cell surface of Ext1−/− ESCs, flow cytometry was performed using HS-specific antibodies. Wild-type cells showed positive staining with antibody 10E4, which recognizes a mixed N-sulfated/N-acetylated epitope (21David G. Bai X.M. Van der Schueren B. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 961-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) and with 3G10, which recognizes unsaturated uronic acid stubs remaining after heparinase cleavage of HS chains (Fig. 1, C and D). Ext1−/− cells were negative for both these antibodies with metabolic radiolabeling and purification of GAGs confirming the absence of HS chains. 3C. L. R. Merry, unpublished data. The flow cytometry profile of Ext1+/− ESCs stained with 10E4 was intermediate between that of wild-type and Ext1−/−, suggesting a decrease in the number of 10E4-reactive epitopes (Fig. 1C). 3G10 binding following heparinase digest however showed that a similar number of chains to wild-type are present, as only one 3G10-reactive epitope is produced by heparinase activity per chain (Fig. 1D). This difference was explained following GAG purification, whereby Ext1+/− HS chains measured only half the length of wild-type,3 supporting the view that the Ext1 locus is haploinsufficient (1Lin X. Wei G. Shi Z. Dryer L. Esko J.D. Wells D.E. Matzuk M.M. Dev. Biol. 2000; 224: 299-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The formation of recognizable mesodermal structures fails in Ext1−/− embryos and preliminary studies have suggested that Ext1−/− ESCs have defects in both mesodermal and endodermal differentiation (1Lin X. Wei G. Shi Z. Dryer L. Esko J.D. Wells D.E. Matzuk M.M. Dev. Biol. 2000; 224: 299-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Therefore using an EB method optimized for the formation of mesodermal/hematopoietic lineages we investigated the ability of Ext1+/− and Ext1−/− cells to differentiate into hemangioblast and blood progenitors. Ext1−/− cells readily formed EBs in culture (Fig. 2A), although EB size and proliferation rate was decreased compared with wild-type (Fig. 2, A and B). Prior to EB initiation, all three ESC lines displayed high levels of cell surface ESC markers SSEA1, CD31, and cKit (22Robson P. Stein P. Zhou B. Schultz R.M. Baldwin H.S. Dev. Biol. 2001; 234: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 23Vittet D. Prandini M.H. Berthier R. Schweitzer A. Martin-Sisteron H. Uzan G. Dejana E. Blood. 1996; 88: 3424-3431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, C and D). In wild-type EBs expression of cKit and CD31 was rapidly down-regulated during the first few days of EB differentiation, as ESC identity was lost and differentiation initiated (Fig. 2D). By days 3 to 4, cKit expression was significantly reduced in ∼60% of cells, concurrent with the onset of Flk1 expression within the cKitlow population, marking the hemangioblast (Fig. 2F). CD31 expression was resumed by a proportion of cells by day 6, marking the appearance of hematopoietic and endothelial populations. CD41+ populations emerge in wild-type cells from EB day 4 to 5 defining the onset of primitive and definitive hematopoiesis (24Mitjavila-Garcia M.T. Cailleret M. Godin I. Nogueira M.M. Cohen-Solal K.

Ruco L. Mantovani A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 63: 247-254PubMed Google Scholar), reaching a maximal at day 6 (Fig. 2, D and E and data not shown). At this stage of differentiation a dual CD34+/CD41+ cell population was apparent, highlighting cells of the definitive hematopoietic progenitor lineage (27Mikkola H.K. Fujiwara Y. Schlaeger T.M. Traver D. Orkin S.H. Blood. 2003; 101: 508-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). A small percentage of CD41-/CD34+ cells were also present in EB cultures at day 6, marking cells restricted to the endothelial lineage. Ext1+/− cells appear to successfully differentiate in EBs, expressing the same differentiation markers as wild-type, albeit at slightly decreased levels (Fig. 2). In contrast to wild-type, expression of ESC markers (cKit/CD31/SSEA-1) was retained in Ext1−/− cells throughout EB differentiation (Fig. 2, C and D). A slight reduction in CD31/cKit expression was apparent in a small proportion of the EB population at day 4 (Fig. 2D). Nevertheless these proteins were not completely lost from the cell surface and indeed high expression of CD31/cKit was resumed by virtually all EB cells by day 6, suggesting that either ESC marker expression was restored, or that CD31low/cKitlow cells were lost from the culture at later day stages. Cell surface expression of hemangioblast marker Flk1 and hematopoietic-specific marker CD41 were absent, indicating Ext1−/− cells fail to commit to hematopoietic differentiation (Fig. 2, E and F). To confirm both the absence of differentiation in Ext1−/− cells and the potential of Ext1+/− cells to form hematopoietic colonies, EBs were dissociated into single cells and assayed in semi-solid clonogenic replating assays for their ability to form hemangioblast-derived blast colonies at EB day 3.5 or primitive and definitive hematopoietic colonies at EB day 6 (Fig. 2, G and H). Hemangioblast colonies were produced by both wild-type and Ext1+/− cells, albeit reduced by ∼50% in Ext1+/− cultures. No blast colonies were produced by Ext1−/− cells, consistent with the absence of Flk1 expression implying a HS-dependent step during the specification of the hemangioblast. This result was mirrored following hematopoietic replating with reduced numbers of colonies in Ext1+/− and an absence of recognizable hematopoietic colonies in Ext1−/− cultures (Fig. 2H). Interestingly Ext1−/− EBs failed to form large numbers of secondary EBs, which are characteristically generated by undifferentiated cells in these clonogenic replating assays (10Fehling H.J. Lacaud G. Kubo A. Kennedy M. Robertson S. Keller G. Kouskoff V. Development. 2003; 130: 4217-4227Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). On closer inspection, EB-like structures were apparent during the first few days of secondary culture, yet proliferation was not maintained. Instead at day 5, when colonies were scored, only non-viable indistinct colonies were visible (supplemental Fig. S1). To further confirm the retention of an ESC-like fate by most Ext1−/− cells upon EB formation, Ext1−/− and wild-type EBs were also replated at day 6 under ESC growth conditions (+LIF) (Fig. 2, I and J). The majority of recovered wild-type cells (97%) displayed a large flattened differentiated appearance, devoid of Oct4 expression, with an extensive actin cytoskeleton and limited proliferative capacity (Fig. 2, I and J). In contrast, two distinct cell types were visible in Ext1−/− cultures: the majority of cells appeared morphologically similar to ESCs with a large nucleus to cytoplasm ratio and were Oct4+ (∼93%); the remainder were flattened and Oct4−, similar to those seen in wild-type cultures (Fig. 2, I and J). Upon passaging, Oct4− cells were rapidly lost from Ext1−/− cultures, with pure populations of Oct4+ ESC-like colonies maintainable for greater than 10 passages (data not shown). As HS appears critical for mesodermal and hematopoietic differentiation, we hypothesized that the addition of soluble heparin may compensate for the lack of cell surface HS on Ext1−/− cells. Thus increasing concentrations of heparin were added to Ext1−/− cells from day 0, and EB cells stained with differentiation markers or replated under hematopoietic-colony forming conditions (with heparin addition) at day 6 (Fig. 3, A and B). With the addition of 10 ng/ml heparin, no rescue of differentiation was observed. However as the concentration of heparin was increased to 100 ng/ml and above, ESC-marker SSEA-1 was down-regulated and expression of hematopoietic marker CD41 became apparent together with an emerging CD34+/CD41+ population (Fig. 3A). Consistent with marker expression hematopoietic colonies were produced in secondary replating assays (Fig. 3B). This effect was dose-dependent, with optimal hematopoietic differentiation seen with the addition of 1 μg/ml heparin (Fig. 3B). Significantly, the number of hematopoietic colonies produced from heparin-treated Ext1−/− cultures was almost identical to those seen with wild-type cells, illustrating the very efficient rescue of hematopoiesis by exogenous heparin. Interestingly, increasing the heparin concentration further in Ext1−/− cells, up to 10 μg/ml, resulted in a decrease in the numbers of hematopoietic progenitors, suggesting that increasing the concentration above a threshold limit becomes inhibitory (Fig. 3B). Minimal differences were observed in the absolute number of colonies formed by Ext1−/− cells whether heparin was included during secondary replating or not (supplemental Fig. S2), implying that the obligatory HS-dependent step is already fulfilled during formation of CD34+/CD41+ precursors. However heparin addition during replating did enable robust secondary EB formation from control Ext1−/− cultures, although when added at this stage, hematopoiesis was not promoted (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. S2). To confirm rescue of EB differentiation by soluble heparin, further analyses of Ext1−/− EBs treated with 1 μg/ml heparin were performed. Heparin addition restored EB size and proliferative capacity, suggesting heparin addition allows an efficient response to both differentiation and proliferative factors (compare Fig. 3, C and D with Fig. 2, A and B). Down-regulation of cKit and expression of Flk1 was also apparent at day 4, marking hemangioblast commitment (Fig. 3E). RT-PCR was used to track marker expression during differentiation (Fig. 3F). Wild-type cells progressively down-regulate ESC-marker Oct4, show transient expression of Brachyury and Flk1 from days 2 to 3 and express hematopoietic transcription factors SCL, GATA1, and β-Major from days 3 to 4 (Fig. 3F), as seen previously (10Fehling H.J. Lacaud G. Kubo A. Kennedy M. Robertson S. Keller G. Kouskoff V. Development. 2003; 130: 4217-4227Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Similar expression patterns were also present in Ext1+/− cultures. Control Ext1−/− EBs without heparin addition failed to down-regulate ESC marker Oct4 and although expression of epiblast marker FGF5 was initiated, its expression was atypical. No significant differences in phosphorylated ERK were detected during the time period of this assay (data not shown) suggesting that other signaling pathways play a more significant role. Similar atypical expression of Brachyury was also seen in Ext1−/− cells, with message apparent from day 2. However unlike in wild-type cultures where expression is transient, becoming down-regulated at later EB stages as later mesodermal markers are induced, Brachyury instead persisted in Ext1−/− cells with an absence of later markers (Fig. 3F). This highlights the failure of Ext1−/− cells to progress beyond the epiblast/early mesodermal stage, instead reverting back to an ESC-like state, albeit with some expression of Brachyury. A small number of Flk1 transcripts were seen at day 6, producing a faint band following RT-PCR (Fig. 3F), however cell surface Flk1 protein was not present at day 6 nor at later day stages by flow cytometry (Fig. 2F and data not shown). Following the addition of heparin to Ext1−/− cultures, wild-type-like expression of FGF5, Brachyury and Flk1, together with hematopoietic markers SCL, GATA1, and β-Major were apparent, albeit slightly delayed, suggesting the restoration of differentiation (Fig. 3F). To confirm the loss of ESC identity by Ext1−/− EBs grown in the presence of heparin, day 6 EB cells were replated under ESC growth conditions. The resulting cells had a large flattened differentiated appearance (Fig. 3G), failed to express Oct4 (Fig. 3H) and had limit"
https://openalex.org/W2068131240,"The maintenance of rapid and efficient actin dynamics in vivo requires coordination of filament assembly and disassembly. This regulation requires temporal and spatial integration of signaling pathways by protein complexes. However, it remains unclear how these complexes form and then regulate the actin cytoskeleton. Here, we identify a srGAP2 and formin-like 1 (FMNL1, also known as FRL1 or FRLα) complex whose assembly is regulated by Rac signaling. Our data suggest srGAP2 regulates FMNL1 in two ways; 1) Rac-mediated activation of FMNL1 leads to the recruitment of srGAP2, which contains a Rac-specific GAP domain; 2) the SH3 domain of srGAP2 binds the formin homology 1 domain of FMNL1 to inhibit FMNL1-mediated actin severing. Thus, srGAP2 can efficiently terminate the upstream activating Rac signal while also opposing an important functional output of FMNL1, namely actin severing. We also show that FMNL1 and srGAP2 localize to the actin-rich phagocytic cup of macrophage-derived cells, suggesting the complex may regulate this Rac- and actin-driven process in vivo. We propose that after Rac-dependent activation of FMNL1, srGAP2 mediates a potent mechanism to limit the duration of Rac action and inhibit formin activity during rapid actin dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2080252542,"The matriptase-prostasin proteolytic cascade is essential for epidermal tight junction formation and terminal epidermal differentiation. This proteolytic pathway may also be operative in a variety of other epithelia, as both matriptase and prostasin are involved in tight junction formation in epithelial monolayers. However, in polarized epithelial cells matriptase is mainly located on the basolateral plasma membrane whereas prostasin is mainly located on the apical plasma membrane. To determine how matriptase and prostasin interact, we mapped the subcellular itinerary of matriptase and prostasin in polarized colonic epithelial cells. We show that zymogen matriptase is activated on the basolateral plasma membrane where it is able to cleave relevant substrates. After activation, matriptase forms a complex with the cognate matriptase inhibitor, hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor (HAI)-1 and is efficiently endocytosed. The majority of prostasin is located on the apical plasma membrane albeit a minor fraction of prostasin is present on the basolateral plasma membrane. Basolateral prostasin is endocytosed and transcytosed to the apical plasma membrane where a long retention time causes an accumulation of prostasin. Furthermore, we show that prostasin on the basolateral membrane is activated before it is transcytosed. This study shows that matriptase and prostasin co-localize for a brief period of time at the basolateral plasma membrane after which prostasin is transported to the apical membrane as an active protease. This study suggests a possible explanation for how matriptase or other basolateral serine proteases activate prostasin on its way to its apical destination."
https://openalex.org/W1969600864,"Neurons incorporated into the adult main olfactory bulb (MOB) and accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) derive from the subventricular zone (SVZ). Despite some recent studies on the role of olfactory neurogenesis in sociosexual behaviors mediated by hormones, data on the implication of estrogens are still lacking. Taking advantage of female aromatase-knockout (ArKO) mice, which are unable to produce estradiol across their life span, we investigated the role of estradiol exposure during early postnatal and adult periods on adult neurogenesis in the MOB and AOB. We found that proliferation of progenitor cells in the adult female SVZ was not influenced by estradiol. However, whereas adult exposure to estradiol influences the turnover of MOB newborn neurons, the survival of those in the AOB depends on exposure to estradiol during the early postnatal period. Finally, based on their expression of Zif268, we showed that newborn neurons in the MOB responded to sociosexual odors, albeit to a lesser extent in ArKO females, suggesting a contribution of estradiol during the early postnatal period to this response. Together, these results suggest that the survival and functional integration of newborn neurons in the adult female MOB and AOB are differentially influenced by estrogens from the early postnatal period to adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2076609835,"A recent proteomics study identified FAM129B or MINERVA as a target of the MAP kinase (Erk1/2) signaling cascade in human melanoma cells. Phosphorylation of the protein was found to promote cell invasion and the dissociation of the protein from the cell-cell junctions. Suppression of apoptosis during metastasis is a prerequisite for the survival and spread of cancer cells. During apoptosis, the adherens junctions are disassembled as the dying cell retracts, and new contacts are formed between normal neighboring cells. In this study, we show that FAM129B was cytosolic in exponentially growing HeLa cells but was translocated to the adherens junctions where it colocalized with β-catenin whenever contact between two or more cells was established. Silencing the FAM129B gene expression by specific siRNAs did not induce apoptosis or inhibit the growth of HeLa cells. However, when apoptosis was induced by exposure to TNFα/cycloheximide or other apoptotic signaling molecules, the onset of apoptosis was accelerated 3–4-fold when FAM129B was depleted. Annexin V binding, the inactivation of the DNA repair enzyme, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and the activation of the caspases occurred more rapidly in the cells lacking FAM129B. The rapid induction of apoptosis in FAM129B knockdown cells was reversed by co-transfection with recombinant FAM129B, indicating that its effect on apoptosis was specific. As apoptosis proceeded, FAM129B was degraded and disappeared from the plasma membrane. Thus, one crucial facet of the mechanism by which FAM129B promotes cancer cell invasion is likely to be the suppression of apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W1998486665,"Activation of the heterotrimeric G protein Gq causes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vivo and in cell models. Our previous studies have shown that responses to activated Gq in cardiomyocytes are mediated exclusively by phospholipase Cβ1b (PLCβ1b), because only this PLCβ subtype localizes at the cardiac sarcolemma. In the current study, we investigated the proteins involved in targeting PLCβ 1b to the sarcolemma in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. PLCβ 1b, but not PLCβ1a, coimmunoprecipitated with the high-MW scaffolding protein SH3 and ankyrin repeat protein 3 (Shank3), as well as the known Shank3-interacting protein α-fodrin. The 32-aa splice-variant-specific C-terminal tail of PLCβ 1b also associated with Shank3 and α-fodrin, indicating that PLCβ 1b binds via the C-terminal sequence. Shank3 colocalized with PLCβ 1b at the sarcolemma, and both proteins were enriched in the light membrane fractions. Knockdown of Shank3 using siRNA reduced PLC activation and downstream hypertrophic responses, demonstrating the importance of sarcolemmal localization for PLC signaling. These data indicate that PLCβ 1b associates with a Shank3 complex at the cardiac sarcolemma via its splice-variant-specific C-terminal tail. Sarcolemmmal localization is central to PLC activation and subsequent downstream signaling following Gq-coupled receptor activation.—Grubb, D. R., Iliades, P., Cooley, N., Yu, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2015514843,"IFNγ exhibits potent antitumor effects and plays important roles in the innate immunity against cancer. However, the mechanisms accounting for the antiproliferative effects of IFNγ still remain to be elucidated. We examined the role of Mnk1 (MAPK-interacting protein kinase 1) in IFNγ signaling. Our data demonstrate that IFNγ treatment of sensitive cells results in engagement of Mnk1, activation of its kinase domain, and downstream phosphorylation of the cap-binding protein eIF4E on Ser-209. Such engagement of Mnk1 plays an important role in IFNγ-induced IRF-1 (IFN regulatory factor 1) gene mRNA translation/protein expression and is essential for generation of antiproliferative responses. In studies aimed to determine the role of Mnk1 in the induction of the suppressive effects of IFNs on primitive hematopoietic progenitors, we found that siRNA-mediated Mnk1/2 knockdown results in partial reversal of the suppressive effects of IFNγ on human CD34+-derived myeloid (CFU-GM) and erythroid (BFU-E) progenitors. These findings establish a key role for the Mnk/eIF4E pathway in the regulatory effects of IFNγ on normal hematopoiesis and identify Mnk kinases as important elements in the control of IFNγ-inducible ISG mRNA translation."
https://openalex.org/W2059092196,"Fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is an important genetic model organism for studying the mechanisms of endocytosis and cytokinesis. However, most work on the biochemical properties of fission yeast actin-binding proteins has been done with skeletal muscle actin for matters of convenience. When simulations of mathematical models of the mechanism of endocytosis were compared with events in live cells, some of the reactions appeared to be much faster than observed in biochemical experiments with muscle actin. Here, we used gelsolin affinity chromatography to purify actin from fission yeast. S. pombe actin shares many properties with skeletal muscle actin but has higher intrinsic nucleotide exchange rate, faster trimer nucleus formation, faster phosphate dissociation rate from polymerized actin, and faster nucleation of actin filaments with Arp2/3 complex. These properties close the gap between the biochemistry and predictions made by mathematical models of endocytosis in S. pombe cells."

The crystal structures of Cma and Cma(P176A) were identical, excluding inactivation of the activity domain located far from Pro-176. In a new peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase assay, FkpA isomerized the Cma prolyl bond in peptide Phe-Pro-176 at a high rate, but Lys-Pro-107 and Leu-Pro-260 isomerized at only <10% of that rate. The four mutant proteins secreted into the periplasm via a fused signal sequence were toxic but much less than wild-type Cma. Wild-type and mutant Cma proteins secreted or translocated across the outer membrane by energy-coupled import or unspecific osmotic shock were only active in the presence of FkpA.

IP3KB can be targeted to multiple cellular compartments, among them nuclear localization and binding in close proximity to the plasma membrane. The B isoform is the only IP3K that is almost ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells. Detailed mechanisms of its targeting regulation will be important in understanding the role of Ins(1,4,5)P3 phosphorylation on subcellular calcium signaling and compartment-specific initiation of pathways leading to regulatory active higher phosphorylated inositol phosphates. Here, we identified an exportin 1-dependent nuclear export signal (134LQRELQNVQV) and characterized the amino acids responsible for nuclear localization of IP3KB (129RKLR). These two targeting domains regulate the amount of nuclear IP3KB in cells. We also demonstrated that the localization of IP3KB at the plasma membrane is due to its binding to cortical actin structures. Intriguingly, all three of these targeting activities reside in one small polypeptide segment (amino acids 104–165), which acts as a multitargeting domain (MTD). Finally, a hitherto unknown subnuclear localization of IP3KB could be demonstrated in rapidly growing H1299 cells. IP3KB is specifically enriched at nuclear invaginations extending perpendicular between the apical and basal surface of the nucleus of these flat cells. Such nuclear invaginations are known to be involved in Ins(1,4,5)P3-mediated Ca2+ signaling of the nucleus.

J. 2004; 382: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar. An Improvision imaging system (PerkinElmer Life Science) built around a fluorescence microscope (Leica DM IRE2) at 100-fold magnification (Leica objective type HCX APO ×100/1.3 oil U-V-I; numerical aperture, 1.3), was used. Illumination (DAPI, 355 nm; EGFP, 482 nm; FITC, 494 nm; TRITC, 546 nm) was carried out using a monochromator system (Polychromator IV, TILL Photonics). Images were taken at room temperature with a grayscale CCD camera (type C4742–95-12ER; Hamamatsu; operated in 12-bit mode; binning 1) on 100 consecutive horizontal planes (z), at a step width of 0.1 μm. Raw data images were stored on a hard disk. To obtain images of optical sections, mathematical deconvolution based on the point-spread function was carried out on up to 80 images of the z-stack using the volume deconvolution algorithm (10 neighbors) (Openlab software, version 3.0.9; PerkinElmer Life Science). The virtual pinhole for removal of stray light was set between 56 and 67%. Three-dimensional models from ∼65 consecutive images were constructed using NIH ImageJ 1.42q and ImageJ three-dimensional viewer 1.5.2 fcs software. For transfection, HeLa cells were seeded at low density on eight-well microslides (IBIDI, Martinsried, Germany). Transient transfection was performed as described above. Approximately 24 h after transfection, the Ca2+ indicator Fura-2/AM (Calbiochem) was added to the medium at a final concentration of 4 μm. After 30 min (37 °C), the cells were washed twice, and medium was replaced with buffer (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 5.5 mm glucose, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). Imaging of cells was performed using a Leica DM-IRBE fluorescence microscope with a 40× objective (1.3 numerical aperture). Alternating excitation at 340 and 380 nm was achieved using a monochromator system (Polychrome II; TILL Photonics, Graefelfing, Germany). Two images were acquired every 2–3 s with a grayscale CCD camera (type C4742-95-12NRB; Hamamatsu, Enfield, UK) in eight bit-mode. Raw data were stored to a hard drive, and ratio images (340:380 nm) were calculated from raw images using Openlab software (version 4.04; Perkin-Elmer Life Science). Cells positive for EGFP were selected as regions of interest, and the mean ratio of the regions of interest over time was used for further analysis. At least three independent experiments were performed with each combination of construct, cell line, and leptomycin B (LMB) treatment. In each experiment, a minimum of 100 cells were randomly selected and examined. To determine the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, EGFP fluorescence intensities of six ROIs in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic areas in each cell were averaged to calculate the ratio of nuclear over cytoplasmic intensity using the ImageJ program (W. Rasband). To determine the plasma membrane/cytoplasmic ratio, EGFP fluorescence intensities of six ROIs both over the plasma membrane and in cytoplasmic areas (near the plasma membrane) in each cell were averaged to calculate the ratio of plasma membrane over cytoplasmic intensity. In selected experiments, background fluorescence was determined by selecting ROIs in areas without cells. Background correction was not generally performed because ratios were nearly unchanged after subtraction of background fluorescence. For evaluation of data, unpaired Student's t test and one-way analysis of variance were performed using GraphPad InStat (version 3.06; GraphPad Software). A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Mean values and S.E. are given. Eucaryotic cells were harvested and lysed in M-PER mammalian protein extraction reagent from Pierce (1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Applied Science, 100 mm PMSF and 200 kilo international units of trasylol were added before use). Equal amounts of cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using standard Western blotting techniques. For detection of IP3KB primary antibody, H00003707-M01 from Abnova was used. The secondary α-mouse antibody was conjugated with HRP. The C isoform of human and rat IP3K is actively imported into and actively exported out of the nucleus of mammalian cells (29Nalaskowski M.M. Windhorst S. Stockebrand M.C. Mayr G.W. Biol. Chem. 2006; 387: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 30Nalaskowski M.M. Bertsch U. Fanick W. Stockebrand M.C. Schmale H. Mayr G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19765-19776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Its nuclear export is mediated by leucine-rich nuclear export signals (NES). To investigate whether NES are also functional in nuclear export of IP3K isoform B, we investigated its nuclear export in Mewo cells. IP3KB was detected by immunofluorescence techniques using IP3KB-specific antibody H00003707-M01 (Abnova) in untreated control cells and in cells incubated with 20 nm LMB for 5 h. LMB is a widely used antifungal antibiotic that covalently modifies exportin 1 (31Wolff B. Sanglier J.J. Wang Y. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 139-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), thereby inhibiting nuclear export. In control cells, IP3KB was evenly distributed between nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 1A, untreated). In LMB-treated Mewo cells, a clear accumulation of IP3KB was observed in most of the nuclei (Fig. 1A, +LMB). Antibody specificity was confirmed by preincubation with a recombinantly expressed IP3KB fragment comprising the antibody binding domain. After this treatment, no IP3KB was detected in Mewo nuclei (data not shown). In additional Western blotting experiments using the same antibody, two protein bands at ∼125 kDa were detected (Fig. 1B). These data confirm the observations of Erneux et al. (6Dewaste V. Roymans D. Moreau C. Erneux C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 400-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) who also detected IP3KB at 125 kDa, despite its calculated apparent molecular mass of 102 kDa. In subsequent studies, we used EGFP fusion proteins of IP3KB to identify the motif responsible for its LMB-sensitive nuclear export. In initial experiments, IP3KB fusion proteins with either C-terminal (HsIP3KB/EGFP) or N-terminal EGFP tag (EGFP/HsIP3KB) were transiently expressed in H1299 and HeLa cells. Both fusion proteins (Fig. 2 and data not shown) showed a very similar nucleocytoplasmic distribution of EGFP fluorescence (H1299: 0.9 ± 0.02 versus 1.0 ± 0.03; HeLa: 1.0 ± 0.02 versus 0.9 ± 0.03). Therefore, only fusion protein HsIP3KB/EGFP and its mutants were used in further experiments. Treatment of H1299 and HeLa cells with LMB for 2, 6, and 24 h always led to a significant (p < 0.01) nuclear accumulation of HsIP3KB/EGFP (data not shown). Because incubation with LMB for >6 h led to massive cell death, fluorescence was imaged after 6 h of LMB incubation in all subsequent experiments. A significant nuclear accumulation was detected in H1299 (0.9 ± 0.02 versus 1.2 ± 0.05), HeLa (1.0 ± 0.02 versus 1.6 ± 0.05), and IMR32 (1.1 ± 0.02 versus 1.8 ± 0.05) cells (Fig. 2). To identify the motif responsible for nuclear export, the amino acid sequence was searched using the relaxed consensus motif of leucine-rich NES ((LIVFM)-X2,3-(LIVFM)-X2,3-(LIVFM)-X-(LIVFM)) defined by La Cour and others (32la Cour T. Gupta R. Rapacki K. Skriver K. Poulsen F.M. Brunak S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 33la Cour T. Kiemer L. Mølgaard A. Gupta R. Skriver K. Brunak S. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2004; 17: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), and each predicted sequence motif obeying this consensus was deleted from the HsIP3KB/EGFP fusion protein. Only one deletion (ΔNES, Δ138–143) caused a significant accumulation in the nucleus in H1299 (1.7 ± 0.06) and HeLa (1.7 ± 0.04) cells. This putative NES was further investigated by functional inactivation using alanine substitution mutagenesis (mNES, 138LQNVQV→AQNAQA). Inactivation of the NES produced a significant nuclear accumulation of the fusion protein in H1299 (1.4 ± 0.04) and HeLa (1.6 ± 0.03) cells (Fig. 2). In conclusion, nuclear export of IP3KB is mediated by a single leucine-rich NES (134LQRELQNVQV) in the N-terminal region of the protein.FIGURE 2Exportin 1-dependent nuclear export of IP3KB. Different EGFP fusion genes were transiently expressed in H1299, HeLa, and IMR32 cells. After 24 h of expression, cells were fixed and nuclei stained with DAPI. EGFP fusion proteins (panels A, D, G, and K) and DAPI (panels B, E, H, and L) were visualized by fluorescence microscopy, and an overlay of the digitized images was created (panels C, F, I, and M). Cells expressing EGFP fusion proteins of full-length HsIP3KB (WT) were either untreated (no LMB) or treated for 6 h with 20 nm LMB (+LMB). In additional experiments, mutated forms of HsIP3KB lacking the NES (ΔNES) or possessing a functionally inactive NES (mNES) were expressed. In three independent experiments, at least 100 cells were analyzed for nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of EGFP fluorescence (see “Experimental Procedures”). Results from one representative experiment are shown (mean ± S.E.) in the bar graph. For significance analysis, one-way analysis of variance and unpaired t test were used (*, p < 0.01; not significant, p > 0.05). Values were always compared with HsIP3KB/EGFP. For detailed information about the constructs, see Table 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A nuclear localization signal mediating the nuclear import of IP3KB was first postulated by Brehm et al. (7Brehm M.A. Schreiber I. Bertsch U. Wegner A. Mayr G.W. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) based on deletion studies. Remarkably, this sequence does not obey the canonical consensus motif of monopartite NLS (K-(KR)-X-(KR)) (34Fontes M.R. Teh T. Kobe B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). For a more detailed characterization, single amino acids of the putative NLS (128KRKLR) were mutated in HsIP3KB/EGFP and the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of its intracellular distribution was investigated in H1299 and HeLa cells. Substitution of the basic residues Arg129 (mNLS-2), Lys130 (mNLS-3), or Arg132 (mNLS-4) in this motif by glutamine caused a significant (p < 0.01) decrease of nuclear accumulation of the fusion protein (Fig. 3). A triple mutant (mNLS-5, K128Q/R129Q/K130Q) showed an effect similar to that observed for the single mutants. No effect was seen by substitution of Lys128 with glutamine (mNLS-1). For example, the mNLS-5 mutation caused a significant decrease of the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio from 0.9 ± 0.05 to 0.5 ± 0.02 in H1299 and from 0.9 ± 0.02 to 0.5 ± 0.01 in HeLa cells. Therefore, all three C-terminal basic amino acids in this motif but not Lys128 are necessary for active nuclear import of IP3KB. Cells that were expressing the mutated EGFP fusion protein mNLS-5 (inactive NLS) showed no significant (p > 0.05) change in its intracellular localization after 6 h of treatment with LMB (H1299, 0.5 ± 0.02; HeLa, 0.6 ± 0.01). Therefore, IP3KB does not possess any further active motifs mediating its nuclear import. In an additional experiment, the isolated NLS (126EAKRKLRIL) was fused to the N terminus of EGFP. This construct (NLS/EGFP) showed a significant increase of nuclear accumulation compared with EGFP alone (H1299, 2.0 ± 0.08 versus 1.6 ± 0.03; HeLa, 2.5 ± 0.17 versus 1.6 ± 0.02). Therefore, this sequence is sufficient for nuclear import of attached proteins. Furthermore, the import activity of this construct was compared with the activity of the isolated NLS of human inositol phosphate multikinase (35Nalaskowski M.M. Deschermeier C. Fanick W. Mayr G.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) revealing a similar strength (data not shown). In summary, the identified NLS (129RKLR) is necessary for the active nuclear import of human IP3KB and the isolated NLS is sufficient for active nuclear import of EGFP. One additional aim of this study was to investigate the possibility that the previously observed plasma membrane localization of human IP3KB (19Dewaste V. Moreau C. De Smedt F. Bex F. De Smedt H. Wuytack F. Missiaen L. Erneux C. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) is due to its binding to cortical actin structures via its actin binding motif (7Brehm M.A. Schreiber I. Bertsch U. Wegner A. Mayr G.W. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Determination of plasma membrane/cytoplasmic ratio of HsIP3KB/EGFP (WT) revealed a clear localization at the plasma membrane in both H1299 (1.5 ± 0.07) and HeLa (1.6 ± 0.07) cells (Fig. 4). Deletion of the actin binding motif led to complete abolishment of plasma membrane localization, translocating the mutant (ΔMTD, Δ103–165) to the cytoplasm (H1299, 0.9 ± 0.03; HeLa, 1.0 ± 0.03). The same effect was observed after substitution mutagenesis destroying a predicted α-helix (mFEA-1, 154IQAQS→PQAQP) or altering the phylogenetically highly conserved FEA sequence (mFEA-2, 150FE→QA) (prediction and phylogenetic data not shown) in the actin binding motif. Disruption of F-actin by treatment of H1299 cells with cytochalasin D (1 μm for 10 min) (36Yu J.C. Lloyd-Burton S.M. Irvine R.F. Schell M.J. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) also completely eliminated plasma membrane localization of IP3KB fused to EGFP (data not shown). An isolated fragment (amino acids 104–165) containing the actin binding motif and fused to EGFP (MTD/EGFP) showed a ratio (H1299, 1.5 ± 0.05; HeLa, 1.7 ± 0.08) similar to that of the full-length protein when fused to EGFP. In additional experiments, the actin fibers were directly identified by staining with TRITC-labeled phalloidin. HsIP3KB/EGFP and MTD/EGFP co-localize with cortical actin fibers in H1299 and HeLa cells (data not shown). In summary, we were able to show that the binding of human IP3KB to the plasma membrane is mediated by its binding to cortical actin structures. An intriguing, hitherto unknown localization of endogenous IP3KB at special nuclear substructures was detected in H1299, Mewo, MCF7, L3.6pC, and T47D cells by using immunofluorescence techniques (data not shown). In H1299 cells, at least one of these structures was observed in 78.8 ± 7.9% of all cells. More than one of these structures was observed in 26.3 ± 4.2% of all cells. In other cell lines examined, these structures were also detectable, but smaller than within H1299 cells. Overexpressed IP3KB/EGFP fusion proteins did not show this localization (data not shown). Using co-localization studies in H1299 cells, we showed that these nuclear structures are not identical with PML bodies (21Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Reich B. Will H. J. Biol.

We tested the hypothesis that the cytoskeleton cross-linker plectin, known to bind both DG and AMPK in muscle cells, acts as a scaffold to regulate DG-mediated mechanical stimulation and pathway bifurcation. We demonstrate that plectin and DG form a complex in AECs and that this complex interacts with ERK1/2 and AMPK. Plectin knockdown reduces DG interaction with AMPK but not with ERK1/2. Despite this, mechanoactivation of both signaling pathways is significantly attenuated in AECs deficient in plectin. Thus, DG has the dual role of mechanical receptor and scaffold for ERK1/2, whereas plectin acts as a scaffold for AMPK signaling but is also required for DG-mediated ERK1/2 activation.

https://openalex.org/W2014535116,"The parasitic protozoan Leishmania invades mammalian macrophages to establish infection. We reported previously that Leishmania manipulates the expression of several non-coding RNA genes (e.g. Alu RNA, B1 RNA, and signal recognition particle RNA) in macrophages to favor the establishment of their infection in the phagolysosomes of these cells (Ueda, Y., and Chaudhuri, G.

We found that the non-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes that are repressed by Leishmania infection in macrophages contain a “B-box” in their promoters and thus require the polymerase III transcription factor TFIIIC for their expression. We also found that Leishmania promastigotes through their surface protease (leishmanolysin or gp63) activate the thrombin receptor PAR1 in the macrophages. This activation of PAR1 raised the cytosolic concentration of Ca2+ into the micromolar range, thereby activating the Ca2+-dependent protease μ-calpain. μ-Calpain then degraded TFIIIC110 to inhibit the expression of the selected ncRNA genes. Avirulent stocks of Leishmania not expressing surface gp63 failed to down-regulate ncRNAs in the exposed macrophages. Inhibition of PAR1 or calpain 1 in macrophages made them resistant to Leishmania infection. These data suggest that macrophage PAR1 and calpain 1 are potential drug targets against leishmaniasis.

This metalloprotease is the major ectoprotease expressed by all pathogenic Leishmania and serves as a ligand for binding macrophage complement and fibronectin receptors (22Yao C. Donelson J.E. Wilson M.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 132: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 23Yao C. Infect. Immun. 2010; 78: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). PAR1 belongs to a family of G-protein-coupled protease-activated receptors that were discovered as the receptor for the coagulation protease thrombin (EC 3.4.21.5) (15Soh U.J. Dores M.R. Chen B.

Four PARs have now been identified. PAR1, PAR3, and PAR4 can all be activated by thrombin. PAR2 is activated by trypsin and by trypsin-like proteases but not by thrombin. Mammalian macrophages only express PAR1, PAR2, and PAR3; PAR4 was not detected in these cells (28Colognato R. Slupsky J.R. Jendrach M. Burysek L. Syrovets T. Simmet T. Blood. 2003; 102: 2645-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). PAR1 is activated when thrombin binds to and cleaves its amino-terminal exodomain to unmask a new receptor amino terminus. This new amino terminus then serves as a tethered peptide ligand, binding intramolecularly to the body of the receptor to affect transmembrane signaling (24Bahou W.F. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2003; 54: 343-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Schmidlin F. Bunnett N.W. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2001; 1: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 26Traynelis S.F. Trejo J. Curr.

The irreversibility of the proteolytic activation mechanism of PAR1 stands in contrast to the reversible ligand binding that activates classical G-protein-coupled receptors and compels special mechanisms for desensitization and resensitization. In endothelial cells and fibroblasts, activated PAR1 rapidly internalizes and then sorts to lysosomes rather than recycling to the plasma membrane as do classical G-protein-coupled receptors (24Bahou W.F. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2003; 54: 343-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Schmidlin F. Bunnett N.W. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2001; 1: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 26Traynelis S.F.

Dev. 2007; 17: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This trafficking behavior is critical for termination of thrombin signaling. An intracellular pool of thrombin receptors refreshes the cell surface with new receptors, thereby maintaining thrombin responsiveness (15Soh U.J. Dores M.R. Chen B. Trejo J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2010; 160: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 16Coughlin S.R. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant.

We show here that the activation of PAR1 induces the release of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm of the macrophages, which in turn activates the calcium-dependent protease μ-calpain (29Kuchay S.M. Chishti A.H. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2007; 14: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 30Demarchi F. Schneider C. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 136-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Calpains are calcium ion-dependent proteases, and thus their activities are strictly regulated by the levels of free Ca2+ ion in the cytosol of the cells (29Kuchay S.M. Chishti A.H. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2007; 14: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 30Demarchi F. Schneider C. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 136-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Ca2+ ions are usually trapped inside membranous bodies like endoplasmic reticulum and are released from the endoplasmic reticulum after being induced by second messengers like inositol trisphosphate (31Berridge M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 32Vanderheyden V. Devogelaere B. Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Bultynck G. Parys J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 959-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Two major calpains, m-calpain and μ-calpain, are distinguished by their requirements of Ca2+ concentrations for functional activation (29Kuchay S.M. Chishti A.H. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2007; 14: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 30Demarchi F. Schneider C. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 136-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Both consist of an 80-kDa large subunit (from the genes Capn1 and Capn2, respectively), each of which forms a heterodimer with a common 30-kDa small subunit (Capn4). These calpains (Capn1/Capn4 and Capn2/Capn4) differ in their calcium requirement for activation (∼50 μm for μ-calpain and ∼500 μm for m-calpain) (29Kuchay S.M. Chishti A.H. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2007; 14: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 30Demarchi F. Schneider C. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 136-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 33Benyamin Y. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 3413-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We report here that one of the subunits of human TFIIIC, TFIIIC110 (13Innes F. Ramsbottom B. White R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 3399-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 34Willis I.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 35Geiduschek E.P.

Dev. 2002; 16: 2593-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), is the target of activated μ-calpain in the macrophages. We provide evidence that TFIIIC110 is responsible for the binding to the B-box-containing promoters in these cells. We show that μ-calpain degrades TFIIIC110, thus inhibiting the transcription of any ncRNA genes that require TFIIIC110, including 7SL RNA, in the Leishmania-infected macrophages. We also provide evidence that PAR1 and calpain inhibitors are potential deterrents against the establishment of leishmanial infection of macrophages. Thrombin, thrombin receptor-activating peptide 6 (SFFLRN; also known as TRAP6), azocasein, and calpain inhibitors calpeptin and calpastatin were purchased from Sigma. Primary antibodies for PAR1 (S-19) and CAPN1 and FITC-labeled secondary antibody were bought from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against the human TFIIIC110 subunits were initially obtained from Prof. Robert White (Beatson Institute for Cancer Research, Glasgow, UK) and later on were procured from Sigma and Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The ORFs of mouse and human RNA polymerase III subunit D and TFIIIC110 cloned into pCMV6-Entry vector were procured from Origene (Rockville, MD). These plasmids when introduced inside the macrophages produced carboxyl-terminal Myc- and FLAG-tagged proteins upon selection of the cells with G418 (500 μg/ml). Myc and FLAG antibodies were also procured from Origene. PAR1 antagonist SCH79797 was procured from Tocris Bioscience (Ellisville, MO). The development of plasmids pSUPER-7SL and pSUPER-7SLmut that contain three G to A mutations have been described before (4Misra S. Tripathi M.K. Chaudhuri G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29364-29373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The B-box sequence of these plasmids was mutated from GGCTGGAGGAT to GACAGGAGGAT using reagents and protocols of the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The macrophages were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagents and protocols from Invitrogen. Nucleotide sequences of primers used to amplify some of the polymerase III-transcribed genes and their flanks from human and mouse macrophages are given in supplemental Table 1S. The promastigotes of Leishmania amazonensis (LV78, MPRO/BR/72/M1845, zymodeme MON-41) and Leishmania major (MHOM/IL/80/Friedlin, zymodeme MON-103) were used in this study. The promastigotes were grown at 25 °C in M199 medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (4Misra S. Tripathi M.K. Chaudhuri G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29364-29373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Avirulent promastigotes were from a cloned laboratory stock of Leishmania that have been maintained in axenic culture medium for >10 years and have lost infectivity in cultured macrophages or in mice (4Misra S. Tripathi M.K. Chaudhuri G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29364-29373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The mouse macrophage cell line J774G8 and the human monocytic leukemia cell line THP1 were used in this study. These cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 20% heat-inactivated (56 °C, 30 min) fetal bovine serum at 37 °C (4Misra S. Tripathi M.K. Chaudhuri G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29364-29373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). THP1 cells were differentiated into macrophages with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (10 ng/ml) for 24 h (4Misra S. Tripathi M.K. Chaudhuri G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29364-29373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The macrophages were incubated with the parasite cells at a macrophage/parasite ratio of 1:10 at 37 °C for 4 h for exposure experiments (4Misra S. Tripathi M.K. Chaudhuri G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29364-29373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Primary macrophages were isolated from the bone marrow and peritoneal exudates of BALB/c mice following standard protocols (37Aouadi M. Tesz G.J. Nicoloro S.M. Wang M. Chouinard M. Soto E.

Immunol. 1988; 141: 180-188PubMed Google Scholar). Macrophages were also derived from human blood monocytes (SeraCare Life Sciences, Gaithersburg, MD). Human blood neutrophils were also obtained from SeraCare Life Sciences. Infectivity of Leishmania promastigotes to the macrophages was determined as described before (4Misra S. Tripathi M.K. Chaudhuri G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29364-29373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cultured macrophages were incubated at 37 °C in growth medium without serum for 5 h before their treatment with thrombin (10 nm) or SFFLRN (100 μm) for 0–4 h before the assay or extraction of RNA and protein. Total RNA was extracted from macrophages using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). For isolation of RNA from unexposed macrophages, an equivalent number of parasite cells were added after addition of TRIzol to the macrophages to account for contribution of Leishmania RNA. Extracted RNA (5 μg) was treated with RQ1 DNase (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the supplier-provided protocols. The DNase-treated RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed using iScript reverse transcriptase (Bio-Rad) in a total volume of 20 μl. Experiments were also done in parallel with RNA samples without the treatment with reverse transcriptase to validate further that the amplification products were not coming from genomic DNA contaminants. One microliter of cDNA was used in real time PCR with a final volume of 25 μl containing 10 pmol of each primer (see supplemental Table 2S) and 12.5 μl of 2× SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Bio-Rad). All reactions were performed in triplicate in the iCycler iQ instrument (Bio-Rad). 18 S rRNA was used as an internal control. The mean value of the replicates for each sample was calculated and expressed as cycle threshold (CT). The amount of gene expression was then calculated as the difference (ΔCT) between the CT value of the sample for the target gene and the mean CT value of that sample for the endogenous control. Relative expression was calculated as the difference (ΔΔCT) between the ΔCT values of the test sample and the control sample for each target gene. The relative quantification value was expressed and shown as 2−ΔΔCT (4Misra S. Tripathi M.K. Chaudhuri G. J. Biol.

Biosci. 2007; 12: 4925-4931Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended to 1–2 × 106 cells/ml in PBS. The cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde, quenched with 125 mm glycine, washed twice with PBS, and lysed for 5 min by a 6-fold dilution in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, protease inhibitor mixture, 1 mm PMSF). Lysate aliquots of 200 μl were sonicated on ice into chromatin fragments with an average length of 500 bp. Paramagnetic beads (Dynabeads, Invitrogen) were washed twice in RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 140 mm NaCl) and resuspended in 1 volume of RIPA buffer. Diluted chromatin (2 A260 units in RIPA buffer) was added to antibody-bead complexes and immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C. Precipitated immune complexes were washed five times, and cross-links were reversed by incubating samples with 150 μl of elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl) containing 1% SDS and 50 μg/ml proteinase K for 2 h at 68 °C. DNA was recovered by capturing beads, the ChIP material was reincubated in 150 μl of elution buffer/SDS/proteinase K for 5 min, and both supernatants were pooled. DNA was isolated using a QIAquick spin kit (Qiagen). Real time PCR was performed using primers described in supplemental Table 2S. Real time PCR data for antibody-bound fractions were compared with a 1:100 dilution of input DNA. Whole cell extracts were prepared, protein concentration was determined using Bradford protein assays (Bio-Rad), and 25–50 μg of protein was analyzed by 4–12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were then blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBST buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1.5 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h. The membranes were incubated overnight with primary antibody in blocking buffer, then washed, and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h (39Tripathi M.K.

Briefly, macrophages in fully confluent 6-well plates were incubated with the calcium probe FURA2/AM (5 μm) for 30 min at room temperature in RPMI 1640 medium. Cells were washed twice in Hanks' balanced salt solution with 0.25% BSA (w/v) and resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution-BSA containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2. Cell suspensions were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. These macrophages were exposed to Leishmania (1:10 in 150 μl of RPMI 1640 medium with heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 37 °C). Fluorescence was measured at 1 min, 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 30 min, and 1 h at 510 nm in a Bio-Rad Versa Fluor spectrofluorometer. Calpain activity was measured using the reagent and protocol of the assay kit from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Macrophages cultured in 6-well plates were exposed to Leishmania (1:10) for 4 h or treated with thrombin or SFFLRN post-serum starvation for 4 h. Control cells were not given any treatment or exposed to avirulent L. amazonensis promastigotes. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 100 μl of extraction buffer. The samples were incubated on ice for 20 min and mixed several times by tapping during incubation. The protein concentration was determined using Bradford protein assays (Bio-Rad). Cell lysates (100 μg of protein) were diluted with 85 μl of extraction buffer and 10 μl of 10× reaction buffer, and 5 μl of calpain substrate was added to each tube and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in the dark. Fluorescence was read using a 400-nm excitation filter and a 505-nm emission filter. Calpain activity is expressed as the difference in the rate of substrate hydrolysis in the presence or absence of calpain inhibitor. Chemical inhibition of calpains was accomplished with a mixture of calpastatin (1 μm) and calpeptin (5 μm). We stably transfected macrophages with a PAR1-AP-pcDNA3 construct (17Ludeman M.J.

Fully confluent AP-PAR-expressing J774G8 cells in a 6-well plate were exposed to Leishmania for 4 h. Another set of cells was serum-starved for 5 h before treating them with 10 nm thrombin or 100 μm SFFLRN for 4 h. After 4 h, the medium was collected and briefly spun to pellet any floating cells.

Leishmania promastigotes were harvested, washed, diluted to 2 × 108/ml in Hanks' balanced salts solution containing 20 mg/ml azocasein at pH 7.4, and incubated at 25 °C with constant agitation. After 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 60 min, 0.5-ml aliquots were removed and mixed with an equal volume of 5% trichloroacetic acid on ice. The absorbance of each sample was determined at 366 nm after centrifugation. The rate of azocasein degradation per 108 promastigotes was determined. One unit of promastigote surface protease activity produces 1 mg/min acid-soluble azocasein peptides at pH 7.4 (44Tzinia A.K. Soteriadou K.P. Mol. Biochem.

https://openalex.org/W2089939452,"Recent studies show that type II transmembrane serine proteases play important roles in diverse cellular activities and pathological processes. Their expression and functions in the central nervous system, however, are largely unexplored. In this study, we show that the expression of one such member, matriptase (MTP), was cell type-restricted and primarily expressed in neural progenitor (NP) cells and neurons. Blocking MTP expression or MTP activity prevented NP cell traverse of reconstituted basement membrane, whereas overexpression of MTP promoted it. The NP cell mobilization induced by either vascular endothelial growth factor or hepatocyte growth factor was also impaired by knocking down MTP expression. MTP acts upstream of matrix metalloproteinase 2 in promoting NP cell mobility. In embryonic stem cell differentiation to neural cells, MTP knockdown had no effect on entry of embryonic stem cells into the neural lineage. High MTP expression or activity, however, shifts the population dynamics from NP cells toward neurons to favor neuronal differentiation.

Neurogenesis in the brain involves proliferation of neural stem cells or their progeny, migration of neuroblasts to their final locations, and their ultimate maturation into functional neurons. This multistep process is mediated by a series of sequential cellular interactions. In the normal brain, constitutive neurogenesis is found in two locations: the subventricular zone (SVZ) 2The abbreviations used are: SVZsubventricular zoneLVlateral ventricleHPhippocampusNPneural progenitorMMPmatrix metalloproteinaseMTPmatriptase7-ADD7-amino-actinomycin DESembryonic stempro-HGFpro-hepatocyte growth factorSDF-1αstromal-derived factor-1αTTSPtype II transmembrane serine proteaseMTPimatriptase inhibitorTRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. of the lateral ventricle (LV), which gives rise to interneurons in the olfactory bulb, and the dentate gyrus subgranular zone of the hippocampus (HP), which gives rise to neurons in the dentate granule cell circuitry for memory and learning (1Gage F.H.

However, there is not significant endogeneous neurogenesis to regenerate the damaged areas (8Greenberg D.A. Jin K. Nature. 2005; 438: 954-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 9Ohira K. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2010; : 1-12Google Scholar). This problem is partly due to the insufficient numbers of cells surviving or reaching the damaged sites. Nevertheless, this has raised the possibility of inducing neurogenesis because these proliferating cells may be able to replace damaged brain cells. Secreted factors such as cytokines, neurotrophic factors, growth factors, proteoglycan (10Galtrey C.M. Fawcett J.W. Brain Res. Rev. 2007; 54: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), and extracellular proteases (11Yong V.W. Power C. Forsyth P. Edwards D.R. Nat. Rev.

Extracellular and pericellular proteolytic enzymes play important roles in development, tissue homeostasis, and remodeling in all organ systems. Protease cascade of the serine urokinase plasminogen activator/plasminogen and the zinc-dependent metalloproteinases may be responsible for the majority of pericellular proteolysis (13Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 161-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). In the brain, serine proteases including the plasminogen activator system have well established functions in synaptic plasticity (14Shiosaka S. Anat. Sci. Int. 2004; 79: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 15Melchor J.P. Strickland S. Thromb. Haemost. 2005; 93: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been implicated in the pathology and regeneration in the central nervous system (16Yong V.W. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 931-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Their roles in NP cells have been investigated only recently. Expressed at low levels in the adult brain, MMP expression is stimulated by trauma and can be linked to repair after injury (17Kim H.J. Fillmore H.L. Reeves T.M. Phillips L.L. Exp. Neurol. 2005; 192: 60-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It has been shown that MMP2 and MMP9 expressed by endothelial cells promote NP cell migration (18Wang L. Zhang Z.G. Zhang R.L. Gregg S.R. Hozeska-Solgot A. LeTourneau Y. Wang Y. Chopp M. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 5996-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). More recently, MMP3 and MMP9 were shown to be expressed by NP cells and are involved in migration and differentiation of NP cells (19Barkho B.Z. Munoz A.E. Li X. Li L. Cunningham L.A. Zhao X. Stem Cells. 2008; 26: 3139-3149Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Neurotrophic factors, growth factors, plasminogen activators, and MMPs were synthesized and secreted mostly in their latent forms and require a proteolytic activation process to generate functionally active proteins. The type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSP) represent candidate activator proteins. Members of this family are usually composed of short cytoplasmic N-terminal domains, a single transmembrane domain, an extracellular domain containing a serine protease domain, and multiple repeats of various domains involved in protein-protein interactions (20Szabo R. Wu Q. Dickson R.B. Netzel-Arnett S. Antalis T.M. Bugge T.H. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 90: 185-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They are ideally positioned to interact with surface proteins, soluble proteins, matrix components, and proteins on adjacent cells. Studies in recent years have shown that TTSPs have diverse roles in cellular activities and pathological processes, including epidermal differentiation (21List K. Haudenschild C.C. Szabo R. Chen W.

Immunogenetics. 1999; 49: 420-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), as well as tumor invasion and metastasis (24Jung H. Lee K.P. Park S.J. Park J.H. Jang Y.S. Choi S.Y. Jung J.G. Jo K. Park D.Y. Yoon J.H. Park J.H. Lim D.S. Hong G.R. Choi C. Park Y.K. Lee J.W. Hong H.J. Kim S. Park Y.W. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2635-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Currently, only a handful of TTSPs are reported in the central nervous system (20Szabo R. Wu Q. Dickson R.B. Netzel-Arnett S. Antalis T.M. Bugge T.H. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 90: 185-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Stallmach R. Gloor S.M. Biochem. J. 2008; 412: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The details of their expression and function in the central nervous system or in NP cells, however, are largely unknown. In this work, we examined the expression and function of one TTSP member, matriptase (MTP) in the various cell types in mouse brain NP cells. We further used an in vitro neuronal differentiation culture derived from embryonic stem cells to investigate the function of MTP in NP cells and in neurogenesis.

Paraformaldehyde solution was purchased from Electron Microscopy Sciences (Haffield, PA). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Sox1-GFP knock-in mouse ES cells (46C ES cells) (26Ying Q.L. Stavridis M. Griffiths D. Li M. Smith A. Nat. Biotech. 2003; 21: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar) obtained from Dr. Austin Smith (University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom) were routinely propagated in 0.1% gelatin-coated Petri dishes without feeder cells in Glasgow modification of Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% FBS, 10% knock-out serum replacement, 0.1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 20 ng/ml of leukemia inhibitory factor. Embryonic stem cell properties were monitored via morphology and Oct3/4 expression as determined by immunofluorescent staining. The cells were never kept in culture over 16 passages. Neuronal commitment was induced by placing 46C ES cells on a gelatin-coated surface at a density of 1–1.5 × 104 cells/cm2 in neuronal differentiation medium. Neuronal differentiation medium is composed of DMEM/F-12 (50/50) (1:1) with neural basal medium supplemented with modified N2, B27, and 50 μg/ml of BSA-V (referred to as N2B27 medium) (26Ying Q.L. Stavridis M. Griffiths D. Li M. Smith A. Nat. Biotech. 2003; 21: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). For some experiments as indicated, the 46C ES cell-differentiated NP cells were plated on a poly-d-lysine/laminin-coated surface at a density of 1 to 1.5 × 104/cm2 in N2B27 medium for differentiation of mature neurons. To obtain neurospheres, 46C ES cells were dissociated and cultured in uncoated 6-well tissue culture plates at 104 cells/cm2 in N2B27 medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Neurospheres that expressed Sox1-GFP generally developed by day 4. NP cells were plated on the poly-d-lysine/laminin-coated surface and cultured in N2B27 medium supplemented with 2% FBS and 50 ng/ml of ciliary neurotrophic factor for 10 days. Adult (8 to 10 weeks of age) male FVB mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation. The brains were immediately removed, placed in a mouse brain blocker, and sliced in the coronal direction at 500 μm thickness. LV areas were taken from the brain slices around 1.18 to 0 mm relative to the bregma, as determined from the adult mouse brain atlas (60Paxinos G. Franklin K. Mouse Brain Atlas. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2001Google Scholar). The lateral walls (SVZ) of the LV were pinched away under a dissecting scope (Olympus SZ) and placed in DMEM/F-12 (50/50) containing 1 mm N-acetyl-l-cysteine. Tissues were passed through a 25-gauge, then a 30-gauge needle attached to a 1-ml syringe. Collagenase and dispase were added to the broken tissues at final concentrations of 0.62 and 66.7 units/ml, respectively, and tissues were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Four volumes of Hank's-buffered saline solution were added, and tissues were further triturated by passing them eight times through a P1000 pipette tip. The dissociated tissue samples were incubated at room temperature for 5 min to allow the connective tissue to settle, and the top half of the supernatant was collected and passed through 35-μm cell strainers. An equal volume of Hank's-buffered saline solution was added to the remaining tissue slurry, and these steps were repeated twice. All collected cell suspensions were pooled together and centrifuged for 5 min at 900 × g, cells were then resuspended and grown in neurospheres in DMEM/F-12 (50/50) supplemented with B27, 2 μg/ml of heparin, and 20 ng/ml of FGF2. The brains of postnatal day 5 FVB mice were dissected, and the meninges were removed. The brains were cut into two hemispheres in the sagittal direction. The neocortex was peeled away from the other parts of the brain tissue, minced into small pieces, and briefly digested with 0.1% trypsin/EDTA in DMEM/F-12 (50/50). After centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 5 min, the tissue pellets were washed twice and further triturated in DMEM/F-12 (50/50) using a pipette tip. The dissociated single cell suspension was then plated in a poly-d-lysine pre-coated T25 flask in DMEM/F-12 (50/50) supplemented with 10% FBS. The culture medium was changed on days 3 and 6 of culture. At 8 days culture, microglial cells were detached from the astrocyte monolayer by shaking at 350 rpm for 20 min. The detached primary microglial cells were collected for culture. Fresh medium was added to the attached astrocyte culture. After shaking overnight at 250 rpm in a 37 °C incubator, medium was removed, and the attached primary astrocytes were kept in culture with medium containing 100 μm cytosine β-d-arabinofuranoside (Sigma) for 3 days. The purity of astrocytes and microglial cells was confirmed by their morphology and expression of GFAP and Iba1, respectively. Typically, more than 90% purity was achieved for both cell types. The mouse brain endothelial cell line bEnd.3 was purchased from the Bioscience Collection and Research Center (Hsinchu, Taiwan, China). Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 4 mm glutamine, 1.5 g/liter of sodium bicarbonate, 4.5 g/liter of glucose, and 10% FBS. The microglial cell line BV2 was routinely cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells cultured on coverslips or 8-chamber slides were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with PBS and then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. After washing, cells were blocked with 4% horse serum and then incubated with primary antibody. Unbound antibody was removed by three washes of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were then incubated with green or red fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies. Cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI, and cells were subsequently mounted and analyzed using epifluorescence (Olympus BX51) or confocal (Leica TCS NT) microscopy. All negative control staining was performed using non-immune IgG of the same subtype. For BrdU pulse labeling, 10 mm BrdU was added to the day 4 NP cell culture for 2 h. After fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde, cells were permeabilized with Triton X-100. DNA was denatured in ice-cold 0.1 m HCl for 20 min and incubated in 2 m HCl for 1 h at 37 °C. After neutralization in 0.1 m borate buffer, cells were blocked and stained with FITC-conjugated anti-BrdU antibody as described above. For 7-AAD flow cytometric assay, day 4 NP cells were resuspended in PBS and then incubated with 7-AAD at 50 ng/104 cells for 5 min. Cells were then assayed using a Calibur cytometer (BD Biosciences). Brains were taken from 8–12-week-old FVB males, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS fixative solution, and embedded in paraffin as described previously (27Lee S.L. Huang P.Y. Roller P. Cho E.G. Park D. Dickson R.B. Mech. Dev. 2010; 127: 82-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical staining was performed using the DAKO EnVision+ kit (Dako Cytomation, Inc., Carpinteria, CA) as described (27Lee S.L. Huang P.Y. Roller P. Cho E.G. Park D. Dickson R.B. Mech. Dev. 2010; 127: 82-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For MTP staining, tissue sections were heated 20 min at 95 °C in 10 mm citrate (pH 6.0) for antigen retrieval, incubated with sheep primary antibody, then with rabbit anti-sheep IgG before incubation with the peroxidase-labeled polymer-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody. Bound antibodies were detected with DAB (3′,3′-diaminobenzidine) substrate/chromogen solution. Cell nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin. For the migration assay, neurospheres were prepared from 46C ES cells as described under “ES Cell Culture and Neural Differentiation.” On day 2, cells that developed into round spheroids were collected using a cell strainer with a pore size of 40 μm. The collected cell spheroids were either cultured directly with freshly prepared neuronal differentiation medium or transfected with siRNA or DNA plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 (see next section). After 48 h of incubation, GFP-positive neurospheres 120–150 μm in diameter were hand-picked under the microscope and used in the migration assay. The migration assay was performed in a transwell system with a pore size of 8 μm (Corning Inc., Corning, NY). The upper chamber of the transwell was coated with a thin layer of growth factor-reduced Matrigel/neuronal differentiation medium (2:1). Neurospheres were then added to the coated upper chamber (10 spheres per chamber) and cultured in neuronal differentiation medium. Chemoattracting growth factors were added to the bottom chamber in neuronal differentiation medium. In cultures where protease inhibitors were included, the same concentration of inhibitors was added to both the top and bottom chambers. After 3 days in culture, the number of cells that had traversed to the bottom chamber were counted. Transfection of siRNA or mammalian expression plasmid was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, sufficient siRNA or plasmid DNA was mixed and incubated with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent at room temperature. The DNA or siRNA/Lipofectamine mixtures were then added to the cells followed by incubation. Most GFP-positive NP cells were successfully transfected with siRNA after 48 h of incubation as monitored using fluorescently labeled siRNA. MTP knockdown or overexpression efficiency was checked by RT-PCR. RNA was extracted from brain tissues using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, brain tissues were ground up in TRIzol using a motorized pellet pestle. After 10 min of centrifugation at 12,000 × g, tissue homogenates were mixed with chloroform by vortexing and then centrifuged. Total RNA was obtained from the aqueous phase by isopropyl alcohol precipitation. Genomic DNA was removed by a 15-min treatment with DNase I (Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C. After heat inactivation, DNase I was removed by phenol/chloroform (1:1) extraction, and RNA was recovered by alcohol precipitation. To extract RNA from cells, cells were directly lysed with TRIzol, and the same procedures as described above were performed. RNA integrity was assessed by electrophoresis, and RNA concentration was measured with a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). The average 260/280 nm ratio (RNA purity) was greater than 1.9. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of RNA using Superscript III reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT) primers at 50 °C for 1 h. cDNA synthesis was stopped by heat inactivation at 70 °C for 15 min, and the RNA in the RNA/DNA hydrid was digested with RNase H. The resulting cDNA was then used in PCR. The gene specific primers were as follows: S15 (mouse ribosomal protein S15), forward, 5′-TTCCGCAAGTTCACCTACC-3′, reverse, 5′-CGGGCCGGCCATGCTTTACG; MTP, forward, 5′-CACTTCCATTATCGGAATGTGCG, reverse, 5′-GGATGTCGCCGGTCAGTATTGGTATCA; MTP3, forward, 5′-CTCATGTTGGTGACACTGAAGTCTCC, reverse, 5′-GGAAGATGCTGCTGTTGCAGGCAGG; MMP2, forward, 5′-ACCATCGAGACCATGCGG, reverse, 5′-CTCCCCCAACACCAGTGC; MMP3, forward, 5′-TTGACGATGATGAACGATGGA, reverse, 5′-CGATCTTCTTCACGGTTGCA; MMP9, forward, 5′-TTCTGCCCTACCCGAGTGGA, reverse, 5′-CATAGTGGGAGGTGCTGTCGG. Protein extracts were prepared from brain tissues and cultured cells as described previously (21List K. Haudenschild C.C. Szabo R. Chen W. Wahl S.M. Swaim W. Engelholm L.H. Behrendt N. Bugge T.H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3765-3779Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 22Guipponi M. Vuagniaux G. Wattenhofer M. Shibuya K. Vazquez M. Dougherty L. Scamuffa N. Guida E. Okui M. Rossier C.

Protein concentrations of the cell and tissue extracts were determined by SuperSignal® West Pico protein assay kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. An equal amount of protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting as described previously (28Lee S.L. Dickson R.B. Lin C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36720-36725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). For quantitation (graph in Fig. 2A), x-ray films from Western immunoblots were scanned with a Bio-Rad computing densitometer, and the integrated absorbance corresponding to the area of MTP was recorded. The corresponding absorbance of MTP was adjusted to that of loading marker actin. Only the protein bands within the linear range of the x-ray film exposure were taken into quantitative measurement. The graph in Fig. 2A shows the MTP value by densitometry; all values are normalized to that of day 2 point. NP cells, both isolated from the SVZ of the adult mouse brain LV (Fig. 1A, aNPC) and differentiated from embryonic stem cells (Fig. 1A, ESC-NPC), expressed MTP mRNA. RT-PCR also detected MTP mRNA in adult brain extracts taken from striatum, neocortex, and the two known neurogenic areas: the SVZ of the LV and the HP (Fig. 1B) along with the expression of MTP3 (Fig. 1B, MTP3), another member of the MTP family that was shown to be expressed in the brain (29Szabo R. Netzel-Arnett S. Hobson J.P. Antalis T.M. Bugge T.H. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Exponential amplification for both MTP and MTP3 in all the tested tissues occurred between PCR cycles 28–30 (supplemental Fig. S1A), suggesting that the MTP mRNA level in brain is comparable with that of MTP3. Western immunoblot (Fig. 1C) showed that a single protein of 70–72 kDa was detected in tissue extracts taken from whole brain, neocortex, HP, striatum, and SVZ by the MTP-specific antibody. MTP was shown to be present either as the full-length protein of about 95 kDa or as the N-terminal processed protein of 85–72 kDa (30Lee M.S. Tseng I.C. Wang Y. Kiyomiya K. Johnson M.D. Dickson R.B.

Chem. 2001; 276: 44581-44589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The antibody used recognizes a region in the N terminus of the processed protein. The detection of a single protein of 70–72 kDa in brain extracts indicated that MTP is present mostly in the N-terminal processed form. To further verify the specificity of MTP expression in the central nervous system, its expression in the various types of cells present in the brain were examined. The PCR product of MTP was detected in NP cells between amplification cycles 28 and 30, whereas it was barely detected in bEND cells after the same number of amplification cycles (supplemental Fig. 1B). After five more cycles of amplification, there is some MTP PCR product in bEND cells (Fig. 1D, lane b), but none was detected in the mRNA of either astrocytes (Fig. 1D, lane c) or microglial cells (Fig. 1D, lane d) isolated from the brain. Immunohistochemical staining of the adult mouse brain showed positive staining of MTP in areas that are enriched for β-tubulin III (TuJ1) or NeuN positive neurons (supplemental Fig. S2). MTP staining, however, was lighter compared with TuJ1 or NeuN staining. The neurons of the neural cortex, the granular neurons in the CA regions and dentate gyrus of HP, and the Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum were all positive for MTP (supplemental Fig. S2). In addition, there is strong MTP immunoreactivity in the lining around the ventricles (supplemental Fig. S2). To further investigate the expression and possible function of MTP in NP cells, we used an in vitro neural precursor differentiated from ES cells in a feeder-free adherent culture. The Sox1-GFP knock-in ES cell 46C (26Ying Q.L. Stavridis M. Griffiths D. Li M. Smith A. Nat. Biotech. 2003; 21: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar) was used in these studies. Sox1 is a mammalian neural progenitor marker; it is first expressed in the neural plate and neuroepithelial cells, but is down-regulated during neuronal differentiation. In 46C ES cells to neural differentiation culture, neural commitment and the subsequent differentiation can be monitored, respectively, by the appearance and disappearance of GFP expression (26Ying Q.L. Stavridis M. Griffiths D. Li M. Smith A. Nat. Biotech. 2003; 21: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). The Sox1-GFP expression also allows isolation of NP cells using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (33Fukuda H. Takahashi J. Watanabe K. Hayashi H. Morizane A. Koyanagi M. Sasai Y. Hashimoto N. Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Sox1-GFP expression were detected in a few cells as early as 2 days after 46C ES cells were cultured under neural commitment culture conditions (supplemental Fig. S3, d2, Sox1-GFP). Cells at this time had lost their ES cell identity as shown by loss of Oct4 expression (supplemental Fig. S3, p"
https://openalex.org/W2060815166,"Ski was originally identified as an oncogene based on the fact that Ski overexpression transformed chicken and quail embryo fibroblasts. Consistent with these proposed oncogenic roles, Ski is overexpressed in various human tumors. However, whether and how Ski functions in mammalian tumorigenesis has not been fully investigated. Here, we show that Ski interacts with p53 and attenuates the biological functions of p53. Ski overexpression attenuated p53-dependent transactivation, whereas Ski knockdown enhanced the transcriptional activity of p53. Interestingly, Ski bound to the histone deacetylase SIRT1 and stabilized p53-SIRT1 interaction to promote p53 deacetylation, which subsequently decreased the DNA binding activity of p53. Consistent with the ability of Ski to inactivate p53, overexpressing Ski desensitized cells to genotoxic drugs and Nutlin-3, a small-molecule antagonist of Mdm2 that stabilizes p53 and activates the p53 pathway, whereas knocking down Ski increased the cellular sensitivity to these agents. These results indicate that Ski negatively regulates p53 and suggest that the p53-Ski-SIRT1 axis is an attractive target for cancer therapy."

The underlying mechanism had remained largely unknown, but we here report for the first time that denitrosylation and ubiquitination are involved. Our results show that the S-nitrosylation levels of Bcl-2 are down-regulated after KA injection and that the GluR6 (glutamate receptor 6) antagonist NS102 can inhibit the denitrosylation of Bcl-2. Moreover, the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of Bcl-2 was found to be promoted after KA treatment, which could be suppressed by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and the NO donors, sodium nitroprusside and S-nitrosoglutathione. In addition, experiments based on siRNA transfections were performed in the human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line to verify that the stability of Bcl-2 is causal to neuronal survival. At the same time, it was found that the exogenous NO donor GSNO could protect neurons when Bcl-2 is targeted. Subsequently, these mechanisms were morphologically validated by immunohistochemistry, cresyl violet staining, and in situ TUNEL staining to analyze the expression of Bcl-2 as well as the survival of CA1 and CA3/DG pyramidal neurons. NS102, GSNO, sodium nitroprusside, and MG132 contribute to the survival of CA1 and CA3/DG pyramidal neurons by attenuating Bcl-2 denitrosylation. Taken together, our data reveal that Bcl-2 ubiquitin-dependent degradation is induced by Bcl-2 denitrosylation during neuronal apoptosis after KA treatment.

The agitation of glutamate receptors is thought to be the primary cause of epileptic seizures. Glutamate receptors are classified into metabolic glutamate receptors (GluRs) 3The abbreviations used are: GluR, glutamate receptor; KA, kainate; SNP, sodium nitroprusside; GSNO, S-nitrosoglutathione; NAC, N-acetyl-l-cysteine; MMTS, methyl methylthiomethyl sulfoxide; FMK, fluoromethyl ketone; AS-ODN, antisense oligodeoxynucleotides; S-ODN, sense oligodeoxynucleotides; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Trx, thioredoxin. and ionic GluRs. Glutamate itself gates three types of ionotropic receptors: NMDA, AMPA, and kainate (KA) receptors. There are also five types of kainate receptor subunits: GluR5, GluR6, GluR7, KA1, and KA2 (1Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3662) Google Scholar). These subunits can be arranged in different ways to form a tetramer. GluR5–7 can form homomers (for example, a receptor composed entirely of GluR5) and heteromers (for example, a receptor composed of both GluR5 and GluR6). However, KA1 and KA2 can only form functional receptors by combining with one of the GluR5–7 subunits (2Bloss E.B. Hunter R.G. Vitam. Horm. 2010; 82: 167-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Kainic acid (KA) is a potent exogenous agonist of the KA receptors, and the systemic administration of KA produces epilepsy in rats or mice accompanied by neuronal damage, mainly in limbic structures such as the hippocampal pyramidal neurons in particular (3Liu X.M.

KA-induced seizures in rodents have been widely used as a model of human temporal lobe epilepsy. We have reported previously that the Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma gene 2) levels are down-regulated in a KA-induced rat epileptic seizure model (3Liu X.M. Pei D.S. Guan Q.H. Sun Y.F. Wang X.T. Zhang Q.X. Zhang G.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17432-17445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The Bcl-2 family proteins are mainly located in the mitochondrial outer membrane and are divided into pro-apoptotic and the anti-apoptotic groups (4Baliga B.C. Kumar S. Hematol.

Several mechanisms have been reported to underlie the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-2, including the regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis or action as an antioxidant. Furthermore, as a heterodimer, the pro-apoptotic protein Bax is attenuated by Bcl-2. Moreover, Bcl-2 prevents the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and inhibits the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 (8Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Malchow P. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1886-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). It has been well established that the Bcl-2 protein levels are essential for its anti-apoptotic function. The regulation of these levels mainly occurs via post-translational modifications and degradation (9Lutz R.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 51-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Glasgow J.N. Qiu J.

FASEB J. 2003; 17: 790-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). More recently, protein S-nitrosylation has emerged as the principal post-translational modification by which nitric oxide exerts a myriad of biological effects. S-Nitrosylation, the covalent attachment of a NO group to a Cys thiol side chain, has been postulated to be a fundamental mechanism in cellular signal transduction. The stability of proteins, cleavage of zymogens, and modification of active proteins can be controlled by this post-translational modification process (15Tannenbaum S.R. Kim J.E. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 126-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 16Hess D.T. Matsumoto A. Kim S.O. Marshall H.E. Stamler J.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 150-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). More recently, nitrosylation has been found to be reversible. Nitrosylated Cys thiol groups can be reduced to free thiols, depending on the conditions, which is defined as denitrosylation and plays an important role in signal regulation in a broad range of diseases (17Benhar M. Forrester M.T. Stamler J.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of Bcl-2 has shown that two cysteine residues in this protein (Cys-158 and Cys-229) are important for the S-nitrosylation process (18Azad N. Vallyathan V. Wang L. Tantishaiyakul V. Stehlik C. Leonard S.S. Rojanasakul Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34124-34134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 degradation is mainly mediated through ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. All four lysine residues in Bcl-2 (K17R, K22R, K218R, and K239R) target this protein for ubiquitin-dependent degradation (19Dimmeler S. Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1815-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). A more recent report has indicated that the S-nitrosylation of Bcl-2 prevents its ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation during the apoptotic cell death induced by chromium (VI) in lung cancers (18Azad N. Vallyathan V. Wang L. Tantishaiyakul V. Stehlik C. Leonard S.S. Rojanasakul Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34124-34134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Similarly, it has been shown that the mechanism of cisplatin resistance involves the up-regulation of Bcl-2 expression by NO, which occurs by preventing its ubiquitin-dependent degradation in human lung carcinoma H-460 cells (20Chanvorachote P. Nimmannit U. Stehlik C. Wang L. Jiang B.H. Ongpipatanakul B. Rojanasakul Y. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 6353-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that KA induces Bcl-2 denitrosylation through the GluR6-KA receptor pathway, which is proposed to facilitate Bcl-2 ubiquitination and finally down-regulate its protein level. The GluR6 antagonist NS102, NO donor S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), sodium nitroprusside (SNP), and the proteasome inhibitor MG132 prevent the denitrosylation and the degradation of Bcl-2, playing an important role in neuron protection in hippocampal CA1 and CA3/DG regions.

Guava TUNEL kit (4500–0121) was purchased from Millipore Co. (Bedford, MA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (A0208), benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethylketone Z-VAD-FMK (C1202), BeyoECL Plus (P0018), Kodak X-Omat film (FF057), PVDF membrane (FFN06), BCA kit (P0012), and methyl green staining solution (C0115) were purchased from Beyotime Co. (Beyotime, Jiangsu, China). SNP was purchased from a local traditional Chinese medical hospital. FasL antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (FasL AS-ODNs), FasL sense oligodeoxynucleotides (FasL S-ODNs), Bcl-2 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (Bcl-2 AS-ODNs), Bcl-2 sense oligodeoxynucleotides (Bcl-2 S-ODNs), Bcl-2 primers, and β-actin primers were synthesized by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China) Co. Ltd. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. The rats were injected three times intraperitoneally with SNP (5 mg/kg) dissolved in saline with an interval of 1.5 h; the first SNP administration was performed 30 min before KA infusion. NAC (150 mg/kg) dissolved in 0.9% NaCl was injected intraperitoneally at 30 min before KA infusion. MK801 (3 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally 100 min before KA infusion. KA (0.6 μg) dissolved in 10 μl 0.9% NaCl (saline) was administered intracerebroventricularly (10 μl, bregma: 1.5 mm lateral, 0.8 mm posterior, 3.5 mm deep) to the rats. DTT (60 μg/kg) and GSNO (0.1 mg/kg) dissolved in 0.9% NaCl were administered (10 μl, intracerebroventricularly) 30 min before KA infusion. Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-al (MG132) (0.1 mg/kg) or z-VAD-FMK (0.6 μg/kg) dissolved in 0.2% dimethlysulfoxide was administered (10 μl, intracerebroventricularly) 30 min before KA infusion. NS102 or GYKI-52466 dissolved in dimethlysulfoxide at a concentration of 10 mm was administered (10 μl, intracerebroventricularly) 30 min before KA infusion. 10 nmol of FasL, or Bcl-2, antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (AS-ODNs) in 10 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) were given to the rats every 24 h for 3 days. The same dose of sense (S-ODNs) or vehicle (TE buffer) was used as a control. The sequence for FasL AS-ODNs was 5′-CTCTCGGAGTTCTGCCAGCT-3′, and that for S-ODNs was 5′-AGCTGGCAGAACTCCGAGAG-3′. The sequence for Bcl-2 AS-ODNs was 5′-TGTTCTCCCGGCTTGCGCCAT-3′, and that for S-ODNs was 5′-ATGGCGCAAGCCGGGAGAACA-3′. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250 ± 10 g were used. Seizures were induced by an intracerebroventricular injection of KA (0.6 μg/10 μl) dissolved in sterile saline. The animals were monitored behaviorally for seizures for at least 6 h after injection. The seizures were scored as follows: 1) behavioral arrest and staring spells, 2) head bobbing and gnawing, 3) unilateral forelimb clonus, 4) bilateral forelimb clonus, 5) severe seizures with loss of postural control, and 6) seizure-induced death (21Racine R.J. Electroencephalogr. Clin. Neurophysiol. 1972; 32: 281-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5762) Google Scholar). Only animals with stage 4 or 5 seizures were used in the analyses. The rats subjected to KA for 3 or 6 h post-treatment were decapitated immediately, and the hippocampal CA1 or CA3/DG region was isolated from each animal and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissues were homogenized in an ice-cold homogenization buffer containing 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 320 mm sucrose, 50 mm NaF, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mm β-phosphoglycerol, 1 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A. The homogenates were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected, and protein concentrations were determined using the BCA method. The samples were stored at −80 °C until use. S-Nitrosylation was detected using the biotin switch method as described by Jaffrey et al. (22Jaffrey S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ferris C.D. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar) in which the free thiols in S-nitrosylated proteins are blocked and the S-nitrosothiols are reduced by ascorbic acid sodium salt to yield free thiols, which can be covalently linked to biotin derivatives and assayed using a biotin-based analysis. Briefly, the cells are lysed in HEN buffer (250 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm neocuproine, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, protease inhibitor mixture), and the resulting lysates are mixed with an equal volume of MMTS buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 μm neocuproine, 5% SDS, 20 mm MMTS) and incubated at 50 °C for 20 min with frequent vortexing. After the free MMTS is removed by cold acetone precipitation, the precipitates are resuspended in HENS buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 μm neocuproine, 1% SDS). After the addition of 2 volumes of neutralization buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100), the samples are then modified with biotin in the following buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 10 μm neocuproine, 10 mm ascorbic acid sodium salt, and 0.2 mm biotin-HPDP). After free biotin-HPDP was removed by cold acetone precipitation, biotinylated proteins are absorbed to streptavidin-agarose. The streptavidin absorbates are then eluted by β-mercaptoethanol (100 mm), separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with an anti-Bcl-2 antibody. For immunoprecipitation, cytosolic fractions (each containing 400 μg of proteins) were diluted 4-fold with HEPES buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm each of EGTA, EDTA, PMSF, and Na3VO4. The samples were then preincubated for 1 h with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences) and centrifuged to remove any nonspecifically adhered proteins from the protein A-Sepharose. The supernatant was then incubated with 2–5 μg of specific antibodies for 4 h at 4 °C. After the addition of protein A-Sepharose, the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for an additional 2 h. The samples were triple washed with HEPES buffer and eluted by SDS-PAGE loading buffer then boiled at 100 °C for 5 min. Western blot analysis was carried out following 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Briefly, the proteins were electrotransferred onto PVDF filters (pore size, 0.45 μm). After blocking for 3 h in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and 3% bovine serum albumin, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies in TBST containing 3% bovine serum albumin. The membranes were then washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies in TBST for 30 min and visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (BeyoECL Plus). The densities of the bands were subsequently scanned and analyzed with an image analyzer (LabWorks Software; UVP, Upland, CA). Rat hippocampal CA1 or CA3 subregions were homogenized in ice-cold degradation buffer and then processed with a total RNA extract kit (Promega, Madison, WI). To amplify rat Bcl-2, the following primer pair was used: 5′ (sense) primer, 5′-TTCTTTGAGTTCGGTGGGGTC-3′; and 3′ (antisense) primer, 5′-TGCATATTTGTTTGGGGCAGG-3′. After 30 RT-PCR cycles, the products were mixed with loading buffer and analyzed on 1.5% agarose gel. 20 S proteasome activity was measured using an assay kit from Chemicon (Temecula, CA), in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol but with some modifications. Briefly, tissues were homogenized in ice-cold extract buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EGTA) and then exposed to ultrasound, followed by centrifugation at 800 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected and determined for protein content using the BCA method. 100 μg of proteins were incubated with 5 μm proteasome substrate LLVY-AMC in 1 ml of assay buffer at 37 °C for 2 h. The AMC fluorophore obtained after cleavage from the labeled substrate was quantified with Hitachi fluorescence spectrophotometer F-7000 at excitation and emission wavelengths of 335 and 460 nm, respectively (23Cardozo C. Enzyme Protein. 1993; 47: 296-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate and then subjected to transcardial perfusions with 0.9% saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m PBS. The brains were then removed, postfixed overnight in paraformaldehyde, processed, and embedded in paraffin. Coronal brain sections (6 μm thick) were cut on a microtome (RM2155; Leica, Nussloch, Germany). The sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in a gradient of ethanol and distilled water. High temperature antigen retrieval was then performed in 1 mm citrate buffer. To block endogenous peroxidase activity, the sections were incubated for 6 min in a solution of 0.1% H2O2 in PBS. To reduce nonspecific staining, the sections were incubated for 1 h in a blocking solution containing 1% BSA, 2% normal goat serum, 0.3% Triton X-100, and 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS. The sections were then incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Bcl-2 (1:50) and 0.3% Triton X-100 overnight at 4 °C. After washing three times in PBS, the sections were incubated for 2 h in biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200) made up in 0.1% BSA, 0.3% Triton X-100, and 1% normal goat serum in PBS. The sections were washed and incubated with avidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at 37 °C. To visualize bound antibodies, the sections were incubated with a 3,3′-diaminobenzidine peroxidase substrate kit and examined under a light microscope. For histological analyses, rats subjected to KA post-treatment for 7 days were perfusion-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) under anesthesia. Paraffin-embedded brain sections (6 μm) were then prepared and stained with 0.1% (w/v) cresyl violet to assess neuronal damage in the hippocampus. The number of surviving hippocampal CA1 or CA3 pyramidal cells/mm was counted as the neuronal density. The human neuroblastoma cell SH-SY5Y was cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in humidified 8% CO2 atmosphere. For transfection experiments, the cells were seeded onto 6- or 24-well plates. Twenty-four h after inoculation, either Bcl-2-targeted or scrambled siRNAs (nonsilencing control) were transfected into the cells, which were at 40–50% confluence. The stock siRNA was diluted in reduced serum Opti-MEM to form complexes with Lipofectamine 2000 at a 1:2 ratio (3 μg of siRNA formulated with 6 μl of Lipofectamine 2000/well for 6-well plates; 0.75 μg of siRNA formulated with 1.5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000/well for 24-well plates). The mixtures were then incubated at room temperature for 20 min before transfection in a final volume of 2 ml/well in 6-well plates and 500 μl/well in 24-well plates. The final concentration of siRNA in the medium was 125 nm. The cells were cultured in Opti-MEM medium for 6 h without antibiotics during the transfection period. Then cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 18 h and stimulated with 500 μΜ KA for an additional 24 h. Apoptotic levels after treatments were determined by DAPI in 24-well plates. Total cell homogenates were extracted from 6-well plates for total protein quantification before Western blot analysis. Total RNA was also extracted from 6-well plates by TRIzol for RT-PCR analysis of Bcl-2. SH-SY5Y cells (2 × 105 cells/ml) were transfected with 125 nm Bcl-2 siRNA pairs (siRNA-1, -2, -3, and -4) or 125 nm scrambled control siRNAs (negative control, sense strand: 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3′ and antisense strand: 5′-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAATT-3′) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. The Bcl-2 siRNA pairs (siRNA-1, sense strand: 5′-GCAAAGCACAUCCAAUAAATT-3′ and antisense strand: 5′-UUUAUUGGAUGUGCUUUGCTT-3′; siRNA-2, sense strand: 5′-GUGGGAUACUGGAGAUGAATT-3′ and antisense strand: 5′-UUCAUCUCCAGUAUCCCACTT-3; siRNA-3, sense strand: 5′-GACCAUGAAACAAAGUUGUTT-3′ and antisense strand: 5′-ACAACUUUGUUUCAUGGUCTT; and siRNA-4, sense strand: 5′-CGACCUCUGUUUGAUUUCUTT-3′ and antisense strand: 5′-AGAAAUCAAACAGAGGUCGTT-3) were designed and synthesized by GenePharma (Shanghai GenePharma Co. Ltd). The cells were transfected with siRNA when 40–50% confluent and in the log growth phase. The transfection efficiency of FAM-labeled negative control siRNA (GenPharma) was 70–80% after 6 h of transfection. TUNEL staining was performed using an ApopTag peroxidase in situ apoptosis detection kit according to the manufacturer's protocol with minor modifications. Briefly, paraffin-embedded coronal sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and then treated with protease K at 20 mg/ml for 15 min at room temperature. The sections were then incubated with reaction buffer containing TdT enzyme and at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing with stop/wash buffer, the sections were further treated with anti-digoxygenin conjugate for 30 min at room temperature, and the color reaction was subsequently developed in peroxidase substrate. The nuclei were lightly counterstained with 0.5% methyl green. The values are expressed as the means ± S.D. The statistical analysis of the results was carried out using the Student's t test or one-way analysis of the variance followed by the Duncan's new multiple range method or Newman-Keul's test. p values <0.05 were considered significant. We previously reported that KA treatment through intracerebroventricular infusion or intraperitoneal injection down-regulates the Bcl-2 protein level gradually in hippocampal CA1 and CA3/DG regions in a concentration-dependent manner (3Liu X.M.

As shown in Fig. 1 (A and B), the treatment of rats with KA caused a dose-dependent decrease in Bcl-2, with the lowest level reached at a dose of 0.6 μg/10 μl. We also observed a time-dependent decrease, with this effect clearly noticeable at 6 h post-treatment and thereafter. KA activates not only KA receptors but also AMPA receptors and even NMDA receptors at some higher doses. We therefore pretreated the rats with the AMPA receptor antagonist GYKI53655, NMDA receptor antagonist MK801 and GluR6 antagonist NS102 before administering a 0.6 μg/10 μl KA injection to investigate whether any of the corresponding receptors is involved in the degradation of Bcl-2 (25Tian H.

FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 1894-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, only pretreatment with NS102 could prevent the degradation of Bcl-2, indicating that KA at the dosage selected exerts its effects mainly through GluR6-KA receptors. To confirm that the down-regulation of Bcl-2 by KA was at the post-translational level, we examined the Bcl-2 mRNA levels in the rat hippocampal CA1 and CA3/DG regions at 6 h post-treatment. As shown in Fig. 1D, KA has no affect on the Bcl-2 transcript levels that were equivalent to the saline control group. It has been reported that Bcl-2 is denitrosylated in some circumstances (18Azad N. Vallyathan V. Wang L. Tantishaiyakul V. Stehlik C. Leonard S.S. Rojanasakul Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34124-34134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). A few studies have also recently indicated that protein denitrosylation can be induced by membrane receptors (17Benhar M. Forrester M.T. Stamler J.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). To test this potential function of KA receptors in our present study, we examined the Bcl-2 S-nitrosylation level using the biotin switch method at 3 h post-treatment when Bcl-2 degradation is not clearly evident. We also pretreated the animals with NS102 to block the activation of GluR6-KA receptors. As shown in Fig. 2A, KA infusions induce the denitrosylation of Bcl-2, which is prevented by NS102, suggesting that the Bcl-2 denitrosylation is indeed mediated by GluR6-KA receptors. We next administrated the exogenous NO donors SNP and GSNO by intracerebroventricular infusion prior to KA injection to suppress the denitrosylation of Bcl-2. As shown in Fig. 2B, both GSNO and SNP were found to be effective Bcl-2 NO donors under our experimental conditions, and Bcl-2 denitrosylation was thus rescued by pretreatment with these agents. This rescue effect was negated by co-administration with the reducing agent DTT. The dephosphorylation of Bcl-2 Ser-87 after the stimulation of human endothelial cells with TNF-α has been shown to promote Bcl-2 ubiquitin-dependent degradation (19Dimmeler S. Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1815-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). It has also been elucidated that the down-regulation Bcl-2 Ser-87 phosphorylation by reactive oxygen species is critical for this ubiquitin-dependent degradation in manganese-superoxide dismutase antisense-transfected squamous cell carcinoma cell line OSC-4 (27Li D. Ueta E. Kimura T. Yamamoto T. Osaki T. Cancer Sci. 2004; 95: 644-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Our previous study also showed that the administration of KA could increase the production of reactive oxygen species (24Li C. Xu B. Wang W.W. Yu X.J. Zhu J. Yu H.M. Han D. Pei D.S. Zhang G.Y. Epilepsia. 2010; 51: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Consequently, in our present analyses we examined whether the Bcl-2 Ser-87 phosphorylation levels are influenced by KA and various NO modulators. The rats were treated with KA in the presence or absence of GSNO, SNP, DTT, and the antioxidant NAC to attenuate reactive oxygen species induction. The effects of these compounds on Bcl-2 phosphorylation were then determined by Western blot using a phospho-specific Bcl-2 (Ser-87) antibody. As shown in Fig. 2C, KA had minimal effects on Bcl-2 phosphorylation at 3 h post-treatme"

However, this chemical-based approach can cause chaotic epigenomic states due to random actions of the inhibitors. We investigated whether JHDM3A/JMJD2A, a trimethylated histone H3-lysine 9 (H3K9me3)-specific demethylase, could function as an effector molecule to selectively demethylate target chromatin, with the aid of a guide protein to serve as a delivery vehicle. JHDM3A, which normally locates in euchromatin, spread out to heterochromatin when it was fused to heterochromatin protein-1α (HP1α) or HP1β; in these cells, demethylation efficiency was also markedly increased. Two truncated modules, JHDM3AGFP406 and JHDM3AGFP701, had contrasting modes and efficiencies of H3K9me3 demethylation; JHDM3AGFP406 showed a very uniform rate (∼80%) of demethylation, whereas JHDM3AGFP701 had a broad methylation range of 4–80%. The methylation values were highly dependent on the presence of the guide proteins OCT4, CTCF, and HP1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation detected reduced H3K9me3 levels at OCT4 regulatory loci in the cells expressing OCT4-tagged JHDM3AGFP701. Derepression of the Sox2 gene was observed in JHDM3AGFP701OCT4-expressing cells, but not in cells that expressed the JHDM3AGFP701 module alone. JHDM3AGFP701-assisted OCT4 more efficiently turned on stem cell-related microRNAs than GFP-OCT4 itself. These results suggest that JHDM3AGFP701 is a suitable catalytic module that can be targeted, under the control of a guide protein, to specific loci where the chromatin H3K9me3 status and the milieu of gene expression are to be modified."
