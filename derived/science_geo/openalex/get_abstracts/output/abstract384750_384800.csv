https://openalex.org/W1974182237,"Bone marrow transplantation is the primary therapy for numerous hematopoietic disorders. The efficiency of bone marrow transplantation depends on the function of long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs), which is markedly influenced by their hypoxic niche. Survival in this low-oxygen microenvironment requires significant metabolic adaptation. Here, we show that LT-HSCs utilize glycolysis instead of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to meet their energy demands. We used flow cytometry to identify a unique low mitochondrial activity/glycolysis-dependent subpopulation that houses the majority of hematopoietic progenitors and LT-HSCs. Finally, we demonstrate that Meis1 and Hif-1alpha are markedly enriched in LT-HSCs and that Meis1 regulates HSC metabolism through transcriptional activation of Hif-1alpha. These findings reveal an important transcriptional network that regulates HSC metabolism."

Mammalian HSCs are kept quiescent in the endosteal niche, a hypoxic zone of the bone marrow (BM). In this study, we show that normal HSCs maintain intracellular hypoxia and stabilize hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) protein. In HIF-1α-deficient mice, the HSCs lost their cell cycle quiescence and HSC numbers decreased during various stress settings including bone marrow transplantation, myelosuppression, or aging, in a p16Ink4a/p19Arf-dependent manner. Overstabilization of HIF-1α by biallelic loss of an E3 ubiquitin ligase for HIF-1α (VHL) induced cell cycle quiescence in HSCs and their progenitors but resulted in an impairment in transplantation capacity. In contrast, monoallelic loss of VHL induced cell cycle quiescence and improved BM engraftment during bone marrow transplantation. These data indicate that HSCs maintain cell cycle quiescence through the precise regulation of HIF-1α levels.

Mammalian bone marrow (BM) has been suggested to be relatively hypoxic compared to other tissues, and primitive hematopoietic cells including hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are thought to be localized in the most hypoxic microenvironment of the BM (Cipolleschi et al., 1993Cipolleschi M.G.

The hypoxic ex vivo culture of BM cells or primitive hematopoietic progenitors results in maintenance of the primitive phenotype (Danet et al., 2003Danet G.H. Pan Y. Luongo J.L. Bonnet D.A. Simon M.C. Expansion of human SCID-repopulating cells under hypoxic conditions.J. Clin.

Very low O2 concentration (0.1%) favors G0 return of dividing CD34+ cells.Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Ex vivo culture of human HSCs under hypoxia also stabilizes the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) protein, a master transcriptional regulator of the cellular and systemic hypoxia response, and several downstream effectors of HIF-1α (Danet et al., 2003Danet G.H.

However, the regulatory mechanism and functional effects of BM hypoxia on HSCs in vivo has not been fully elucidated. In the stem cell niche, HSCs are quiescent and show slow cell cycling. Various extracellular ligands, including CXCL12, angiopoietin-1, and/or thrombopoietin (TPO), contribute the quiescence of HSCs (Sugiyama et al., 2006Sugiyama T. Kohara H. Noda M. Nagasawa T.

Quiescent HSCs are maintained at a lower oxidative stress state to avoid their differentiation and exhaustion (Jang and Sharkis, 2007Jang Y.Y. Sharkis S.J. A low level of reactive oxygen species selects for primitive hematopoietic stem cells that may reside in the low-oxygenic niche.Blood. 2007; 110: 3056-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). HIF-1α is a bHLH-PAS-type transcriptional regulator. Under normoxic conditions, prolyl residues in the HIF-1α oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODD) are hydroxylated by HIF prolyl hydroxylases (Phds) (Semenza, 2007Semenza G.L. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) pathway.Sci. STKE. 2007; 2007: cm8Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, Simon and Keith, 2008Simon M.C. Keith B. The role of oxygen availability in embryonic development and stem cell function.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). The hydroxylated ODD domain of HIF-1α protein is recognized by an E3 ubiquitin ligase, von Hippel-Lindau protein (VHL). In the autosomal-dominant hereditary disorder von Hippel Lindau disease, the VHL is mutated, resulting in overstabilized HIF-1α protein by the impaired ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Under hypoxic conditions, Phds are inactivated and HIF-1α protein escapes protein degradation. Several niche factors, such as TPO and stem cell factor (SCF), also stabilize HIF-1α protein in hematopoietic cells even under normoxia conditions (Kirito et al., 2005Kirito K. Fox N. Komatsu N. Kaushansky K. Thrombopoietin enhances expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in primitive hematopoietic cells through induction of HIF-1alpha.Blood. 2005; 105: 4258-4263Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, Pedersen et al., 2008Pedersen M. Lofstedt T. Sun J. Holmquist-Mengelbier L. Pahlman S. Ronnstrand L. Stem cell factor induces HIF-1alpha at normoxia in hematopoietic cells.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 377: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Stabilized HIF-1α protein forms a heterodimeric transcriptional complex with the oxygen-independent subunit HIF-1β, translocates to the nucleus, and directly binds hypoxia-responsive elements found in the promoter regions of numerous downstream regulators, thereby activating these regulators (Semenza, 2007Semenza G.L. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) pathway.Sci. STKE. 2007; 2007: cm8Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, Simon and Keith, 2008Simon M.C. Keith B. The role of oxygen availability in embryonic development and stem cell function.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). HIF-1β is reportedly required for hematopoietic cell generation during ontogeny (Adelman et al., 1999Adelman D.M. Maltepe E. Simon M.C. Multilineage embryonic hematopoiesis requires hypoxic ARNT activity.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2478-2483Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, a detailed analysis of the contribution of HIF-1α to the maintenance of adult HSCs has not yet been reported. Therefore, in the present study, we analyzed HSCs in HIF-1α- and VHL-deficient mice and found that the cellular pool and cell cycle status of HSCs were regulated by the HIF-1α level. Our analysis revealed that the regulation of the HIF-1α dose is critical for HSC maintenance in the hypoxic niche microenvironment of the BM. To analyze the intracellular oxygenation status of HSCs, we examined the uptake of the hypoxic cell marker pimonidazole (Pimo) by BM cells in vivo (Figure 1A ). Intracellular incorporation of Pimo was analyzed by multicolor flow cytometry with a fluorescein (FITC)-conjugated anti-Pimo antibody 90 min after intravenous Pimo administration into mice. The BM MNCs were subdivided into highly (Pimo+++; top 30% of BM MNCs), moderately (Pimo++; middle 40% of BM MNCs), and weakly (Pimo+; bottom 30% of BM MNCs) Pimo-positive fractions. The distribution of Tie2+ cells in Lineage marker− Sca-1+ c-Kit+ cells (Tie2+ LSK cells), which represent quiescent HSCs (Arai et al., 2004Arai F. Hirao A. Ohmura M. Sato H. Matsuoka S. Takubo K. Ito K. Koh G.Y. Suda T. Tie2/angiopoietin-1 signaling regulates hematopoietic stem cell quiescence in the bone marrow niche.Cell. 2004; 118: 149-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar), was clearly enriched in the Pimo+++ fraction of BM MNCs (Figure 1A). The Pimo+++ fraction contained 68.2% of the LT-HSC (long-term reconstituting HSC) fraction that is made up of CD150+ CD48− CD41− LSK cells, (Kiel et al., 2005Kiel M.J. Yilmaz O.H. Iwashita T. Yilmaz O.H. Terhorst C. Morrison S.J. SLAM family receptors distinguish hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and reveal endothelial niches for stem cells.Cell. 2005; 121: 1109-1121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar) and 62.4% of the LSK fraction (Figure 1B). In sharp contrast, the Pimo+ fraction only contained 1.8% of the CD150+ CD48− CD41− LSK fraction and 3.5% of the LSK fraction (Figure 1B). Because 30% of the MNCs and 44.5% of the Lineage marker-negative (Lin−) cells were Pimo+ (Figure 1B), we conclude that primitive hematopoietic cells, including CD150+ CD48− CD41− LSK, Tie2+ LSK, and LSK cells, are hypoxic in the BM in vivo. Next, the mRNA expression levels of three HIF-α subunits, HIF-1α, -2α, and -3α, in CD34− LSK (the fraction of LT-HSC [Osawa et al., 1996Osawa M. Hanada K. Hamada H. Nakauchi H. Long-term lymphohematopoietic reconstitution by a single CD34-low/negative hematopoietic stem cell.Science. 1996; 273: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar], CD34+ LSK (short-term reconstituting HSC; ST-HSC and multi-potent progenitor; MPP), Lin−, and Lin+ cells in 10-week-old BM were confirmed by quantitative PCR. The HIF-1α expression was higher in the more primitive fractions than in the differentiated fraction, and expression was highest in CD34− LSK cells (Figure 1C). Consistent with this, among the three homologs of the hypoxia-regulated HIF-α subunits, the online SAGE database SCDb (Hackney and Moore, 2005Hackney J.A. Moore K.A. A functional genomics approach to hematopoietic stem cell regulation.Methods Mol. Med. 2005; 105: 439-452PubMed Google Scholar) shows the preferential expression of the HIF-1α transcript (SCDb ID: BMSB10895) in adult mouse HSCs (BM Rhodaminelo Hoechstlo) rather than in the differentiated cell fraction (Lin+). In our analysis, the expression level of HIF-2α mRNA in CD34− LSK cells was higher than in CD34+ LSK cells. However, the highest expression among the four fractions was observed in Lin− cells. HIF-2α protein was mainly observed in the cytoplasm of CD34− LSK or CD34+ LSK cells after hypoxic exposure ex vivo (Figure S1A available online). The expression level of the most uncharacterized HIF-α subunit, HIF-3α, was highest in the CD34− LSK fraction. Although the effect of HIF-3α on the cellular hypoxia response remains to be elucidated, HIF-3α itself is a direct transcriptional target of HIF-1α (Tanaka et al., 2009Tanaka T. Wiesener M. Bernhardt W. Eckardt K.U. Warnecke C. The human HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor)-3alpha gene is a HIF-1 target gene and may modulate hypoxic gene induction.Biochem. J. 2009; 424: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, high HIF-3α expression levels in the CD34− LSK fraction implicate the preferential activation of HIF-1α in LT-HSCs. To analyze the HIF-1α protein expression in situ, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of BM sections with anti-Pimo, anti-HIF-1α, and anti-Foxo3a antibodies. Foxo3a is a forkhead-type transcription factor that is essential for HSC quiescence (Tothova et al., 2007Tothova Z. Kollipara R. Huntly B.J. Lee B.H. Castrillon D.H. Cullen D.E. McDowell E.P. Lazo-Kallanian S. Williams I.R.

Araki K.Y. Naka K. Arai F. Takubo K. Yamazaki S. Matsuoka S. Miyamoto T. Ito K. Ohmura M. et al.Foxo3a is essential for maintenance of the hematopoietic stem cell pool.Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 101-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Because Foxo3a is only retained within LT-HSC nuclei and is excluded from ST-HSC/MPP nuclei, nuclear Foxo3a is a marker for quiescent HSCs (Miyamoto et al., 2007Miyamoto K. Araki K.Y. Naka K. Arai F. Takubo K. Yamazaki S. Matsuoka S. Miyamoto T. Ito K. Ohmura M. et al.Foxo3a is essential for maintenance of the hematopoietic stem cell pool.Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 101-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). More than 86.8% of the Pimo+ c-Kit+ cells possessed nuclear HIF-1α and Foxo3a (Figures 1D and 1E). Of the c-Kit+ HIF-1α+ cells, 95.4% had nuclear-localized Foxo3a, suggesting that the c-Kit+ HIF-1α+ Foxo3a+ (KHF) cells were putative LT-HSCs in the BM (Figure 1F). In addition, 70.0% of the KHF cells localized to the endosteal zone of the BM, as reported previously (Kubota et al., 2008Kubota Y. Takubo K. Suda T. Bone marrow long label-retaining cells reside in the sinusoidal hypoxic niche.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 366: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical analysis of the BM with SLAM markers (Kiel et al., 2005Kiel M.J. Yilmaz O.H. Iwashita T. Yilmaz O.H. Terhorst C. Morrison S.J. SLAM family receptors distinguish hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and reveal endothelial niches for stem cells.Cell. 2005; 121: 1109-1121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar) revealed that these SLAM HSCs also expressed HIF-1α in vivo (Figure S1B). We next examined the pure effect of hypoxia on HIF-1α protein stabilization. Isolated CD34− LSK or CD34+ LSK cells were exposed to normoxia (20% O2) or hypoxia (1% O2) without cytokines for 12 hr, after which the c-Kit, HIF-1α, and Foxo3a protein levels were examined by immunocytochemistry (Figures 1G–1J). Stabilization of the nuclear HIF-1α protein was mainly observed in CD34− LSK cell samples exposed to hypoxia (Figure 1G). Levels of stabilized nuclear HIF-1α protein were relatively low in CD34− LSK cell samples exposed to normoxia and in CD34+ LSK cell samples exposed to any oxygen tension (Figures 1H–1J). Effects of hypoxia and HIF-1α-stabilizing cytokines SCF and TPO on HIF-1α levels were examined by quantification of HIF-1α fluorescence intensity in LT-HSCs (CD34− Flt3− LSK) or CD34+ LSK cells (Figure S1C). Without cytokines or hypoxic exposure, HIF-1α fluorescence intensity in LT-HSCs was higher than in CD34+ LSK cells. Exposure to cytokines or hypoxia stabilized HIF-1α protein in LT-HSCs and CD34+ LSK cells (Figure S1C). However, HIF-1α was highly stabilized in LT-HSC cells (Figure S1C). In contrast, cytokines induced HIF-1α stabilization more efficiently in CD34+ LSK cells (Figure S1C). The expression levels of Phd and VHL, the essential HIF-α degradation machinery, potentially help determine the set point for HIF-1α stabilization. To analyze the specific destabilization mechanism in CD34+ LSK cells, we performed quantitative PCR analysis for Phds and VHL (Figure 1K). The expression level of Phd2 was higher in CD34+ LSK cells than in CD34− LSK cells (Figure 1K). Of the Phd family members, Phd2 is the one most responsible for HIF-1α stabilization (Semenza, 2007Semenza G.L. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) pathway.Sci. STKE. 2007; 2007: cm8Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Thus, the higher Phd2 expression in CD34+ LSK cells could be a regulatory mechanism for the preferential degradation of HIF-1α in CD34+ LSK cells exposed to hypoxia. These data collectively suggest the specific contribution of HIF-1α to HSC maintenance in vivo. We next examined the functional effect of HIF-1α on the quiescent state of HSCs by analyzing an inducible HIF-1α deletion model in vivo. To delete the HIF-1α gene from HSCs, we induced the Cre transgene in Mx1-Cre:HIF-1αflox/flox mice (Ryan et al., 1998Ryan H.E. Lo J. Johnson R.S. HIF-1 alpha is required for solid tumor formation and embryonic vascularization.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3005-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar, Kuhn et al., 1995Kuhn R. Schwenk F. Aguet M. Rajewsky K. Inducible gene targeting in mice.Science. 1995; 269: 1427-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar) by sequential polyI:polyC (pIpC) injections, which efficiently excised the HIF-1α gene from the hematological organs and peripheral blood (PB) cells (Figures S1D, S1E, S1H, and S1I). The deletion was maintained for at least 2 years in vivo (Figures S1H and S1I). In this mouse model (HIF-1αΔ/Δ mice), the PB cell count and differentiation statuses of PB, thymus, spleen, and BM cells were maintained, except for a slight increase in leukocyte numbers and a reduction in the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) (Figures 2A and Figures S1F and S1G). Therefore, the overall differentiation capacity of HIF-1αΔ/Δ HSCs was identical to that of HIF-1α+/+ HSCs at steady state. We next assessed the progenitor capacity of HIF-1αΔ/Δ BM MNCs. The conventional hematopoietic progenitor assays CFU-C and CFU-S12 revealed no significant difference between HIF-1α+/+ and HIF-1αΔ/Δ BM MNCs (Figures S2A and S2B). In addition, the short-term (4 week) PB reconstitution abilities by sorted HIF-1αΔ/Δ CD34+ LSK cells transplanted into lethally irradiated Ly5.1 congenic recipients with Ly5.1 competitor cells were identical between the two genotypes (Figures S2C). Therefore, the short-term reconstitution ability of CD34+ LSK cells (ST-HSCs and MPP cells) was normal under the HIF-1αΔ/Δ condition. We evaluated the stem cell capacity of HIF-1αΔ/Δ HSCs by competitive BM transplantation (BMT). We transplanted 2000 LSK cells sorted from HIF-1α+/+ or HIF-1αΔ/Δ mice into lethally irradiated Ly5.1 congenic recipients with Ly5.1 competitor cells. In 12-week-old HIF-1αΔ/Δ mice (1–2 months after pIpC injection), the frequency of the LSK cells and the more primitive subfractions of LSK cells (CD150+ CD48− CD41− LSK, Tie2+ LSK, or CD34− Flt3− LSK cells) were similar to those in HIF-1α+/+ mice (Figure S2D). In primary recipients, the HIF-1αΔ/Δ donor cells achieved significantly greater PB chimerism for up to 3 months after BMT, and PB chimerism reached a plateau between 3 and 4 months after BMT (Figure 2B). Four months after BMT, recipients of the HIF-1αΔ/Δ donor cells exhibited less chimerism than recipients of HIF-1α+/+ donor cells in the LSK-gated fraction of the BM (Figures 2C and 2D), indicating that the HSC levels were decreased. Spleens were also examined in the primary recipients at four months after BMT. However, no evidence for extramedullary hematopoietis was observed in HIF-1αΔ/Δ HSC recipients (Figure S2E). At this time, HIF-1αΔ/Δ donor-derived PB differentiation showed increased T and myeloid cell and reduced B cell counts (Figure 2E). Significant elevation of Ink4a transcription, a hallmark of senescent stem cells (Naka et al., 2008Naka K. Muraguchi T. Hoshii T. Hirao A. Regulation of reactive oxygen species and genomic stability in hematopoietic stem cells.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2008; 10: 1883-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), was also detected in HIF-1αΔ/Δ LSK cells from primary BMT recipients (Figure 2F). We then isolated and transplanted 3000 primary donor-derived LSK cells into secondary recipients. A devastating loss in the long-term reconstitution ability of the HIF-1αΔ/Δ HSCs was seen in the PB and BM of the secondary recipient (Figures 2G–2I). Although surface marker analysis suggests that the frequency of various HSC fractions is within normal limits in young HIF-1αΔ/Δ mice (Figure S2D), the possibility exists that HSC contents within the LSK fraction before BMT are already compromised in HIF-1αΔ/Δ mice. To exclude this possibility, we prepared 1:1 BM chimera by transplanting pIpC-untreated Mx1-cre:HIF-1α+/+ or Mx1-cre:HIF-1αflox/flox BM MNCs with identical numbers of CD45.1+ CD45.2+ competitor BM MNCs (Figure S2F). pIpC was intraperitoneally injected 4 months after BMT (“0 month” in Figure S2G). Before the pIpC injections, the PB repopulation unit (CD45.2+ donor-derived chimerism [%]/CD45.1+ CD45.2+ competitor-derived chimerism [%]) was identical for the two genotypes (Figure S2G). Four months after the pIpC injection, the HIF-1αΔ/Δ PB repopulation unit overwhelmed HIF-1α+/+ PB population in HIF-1α+/+ recipients (Figure S2G). However, at 11 months after the pIpC injection, the level of the HIF-1αΔ/Δ PB repopulation had decreased below the level of the HIF-1α+/+ PB repopulation unit. These data are consistent with the experimental phenotype of LSK BMT (Figures 2B and 2G) in primary recipients (4 months after pIpC in 1:1 BM chimera) and secondary recipients (11 months after pIpC in 1:1 BM chimera) and supports the progressive loss of HIF-1αΔ/Δ HSCs during BMT. To directly analyze the impact of upregulated Ink4a products on HIF-1αΔ/Δ HSCs, we suppressed Ink4a products in HIF-1αΔ/Δ LSK cells by using the retroviral Bmi1 expression vector (Iwama et al., 2004Iwama A. Oguro H. Negishi M. Kato Y. Morita Y. Tsukui H. Ema H. Kamijo T. Katoh-Fukui Y. Koseki H. et al.Enhanced self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells mediated by the polycomb gene product Bmi-1.Immunity. 2004; 21: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) (Figure 2J). Isolated HIF-1αΔ/Δ LSK cells were transduced by control MSCV-IRES-EGFP retrovirus (GFP virus) or MSCV-Bmi1-IRES-EGFP retrovirus (Bmi1 virus) in an ex vivo culture with cytokines under normoxia. After transduction, the HIF-1αΔ/Δ LSK cells transduced with GFP virus showed significantly higher transcript levels of p16Ink4a and p19Arf than the HIF-1α+/+ LSK cells transduced with GFP virus (Figure 2K). This observation confirmed the vulnerability of HIF-1αΔ/Δ LSK cells under stressed conditions (ex vivo culture) and following BMT (Figure 2F). Transduction of the Bmi1 virus into HIF-1αΔ/Δ LSK cells suppressed the upregulation of p16Ink4a and p19Arf transcripts compared to HIF-1αΔ/Δ LSK cells transduced with GFP virus (Figure 2K). The sorting and transplantation of transduced cells revealed defects in PB repopulation and BM reconstitution after BMT in HIF-1αΔ/Δ LSK cells transduced with GFP virus (Figures 2L and 2M), which were significantly restored by the forced expression of Bmi1 in HIF-1αΔ/Δ LSK cells (Figures 2L and 2M). Collectively, these results indicate that the stem cell capacity, but not the progenitor capacity or productivity of differentiated HIF-1αΔ/Δ hematopoietic cells is impaired. Furthermore, other Bmi1 targets in HSCs, Pax5, and Ebf1 (Oguro et al., 2010Oguro H. Yuan J. Ichikawa H. Ikawa T. Yamazaki S. Kawamoto H. Nakauchi H. Iwama A. Poised lineage specification in multipotential hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells by the polycomb protein Bmi1.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 6: 279-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) were not upregulated in HIF-1αΔ/Δ CD34− Flt3− LSK cells and were not suppressed by overexpression of Bmi1 (Figures S2H–S2J and data not shown); HIF-1α appears to play a protective role, mediated by Ink4a gene products, against senescence-induced HSC exhaustion. Because transplantation of wild-type CD45.1+ BM MNCs into HIF-1α+/+ or HIF-1αΔ/Δ mouse BM environments caused a decrease in short-term reconstitution (∼2 months from BMT) and a loss of PB differentiation status, but not long-term reconstitution (4 months from BMT) (Figures S2K and S2L), defective maintenance of HIF-1αΔ/Δ HSCs under stress settings is mainly an cell-autonomous event. We next examined the physiological stress resistance of HIF-1αΔ/Δ HSCs during aging. Aging significantly reduced the frequency (Figure 3A and Figure S2D) and number (Figure 3B) of putative HSCs (CD150+ CD48− CD41− LSK, Tie2+ LSK, or CD34− Flt3− LSK cells) in 56- to 74-week-old HIF-1αΔ/Δ mice compared to HIF-1α+/+ mice. In 24-week-old HIF-1αΔ/Δ mice (i.e., when HSC loss has already started), more than 65% of the CD150+ CD48- CD41− LSK or Tie2+ LSK cells were Pimo+++ (Figures 3C and 3D) in accordance with the results in Figure 1A. The Pimo+ fraction only contained less than 2% of the CD150+ CD48− CD41− LSK or Tie2+ LSK fraction (Figures 3C and 3D). Tie2+ LSK or CD150+ CD48− CD41− LSK cell loss was severe in the Pimo+++ fraction of HIF-1αΔ/Δ HSCs, and the Pimo+ fraction was increased in Tie2+ LSK cells and CD150+ CD48− CD41− LSK cells (Figures 3C and 3D). Because the mean Pimo fluorescence and distribution in total BM MNCs was unchanged at this time (data not shown), the oxygenation status (Pimo+++/Pimo++/Pimo+) in the HIF-1αΔ/Δ HSC pool might not depend on the overall BM oxygenation status, but on the HIF-1α-mediated intracellular oxygenation homeostasis of HSCs. These results suggest that HIF-1α, by modulating the oxygenation status of cells, critically regulates resistance to various stresses, including aging, in hypoxic mammalian HSCs. Moreover, in the aged HIF-1αΔ/Δ mice, we observed an increased number of LSK cells in the extramedullary site, spleen (Figure 3E). The red and white pulp structures of the spleen were disorganized in the aged HIF-1αΔ/Δ mice because of extracellular hematopoiesis (Figure 3F). Transplantation of 1 × 106 splenic MNCs rescued the lethally irradiated recipients (Figure 3G), which suggests that splenic LSK cells support the hematopoiesis of recipient mice. Sustaining cell cycle quiescence is an effective defense against stress in various species, organs, and individual cells, including mammalian HSCs (Arai et al., 2004Arai F. Hirao A. Ohmura M. Sato H. Matsuoka S. Takubo K. Ito K. Koh G.Y. Suda T. Tie2/angiopoietin-1 signaling regulates hematopoietic stem cell quiescence in the bone marrow niche.Cell. 2004; 118: 149-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). Therefore, to investigate the mechanism of HSC loss in HIF-1αΔ/Δ mice, we focused on the cell cycle of HIF-1αΔ/Δ HSCs. We sequentially injected the myelosuppressive agent 5-FU into mice. Sequential injections of a sublethal dose of 5-FU depletes cycling HSCs and causes quiescent HSCs to proliferate (Miyamoto et al., 2007Miyamoto K. Araki K.Y. Naka K. Arai F. Takubo K. Yamazaki S. Matsuoka S. Miyamoto T. Ito K. Ohmura M. et al.Foxo3a is essential for maintenance of the hematopoietic stem cell pool.Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 101-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). HIF-1αΔ/Δ mice showed significantly higher mortality rates than controls in response to myelosuppression by 5-FU (Figure 4A ). This was primarily a hematopoietic cell-dependent event, given that recipient mice with BM from HIF-1αΔ/Δ mice also showed higher mortalities by 5-FU than controls (Figure S3A). The cell cycle kinetics of the HIF-1αΔ/Δ HSCs was directly examined by multicolor flow cytometry. Specific activation of the cell cycle, characterized by a reduction in the Ki67− G0 fraction and an increase in the Ki67+ G1 fraction, was detected in HIF-1αΔ/Δ CD34− LSK cells by flow cytometric analysis (Figure 4B). Because the G0 phase in the CD34+ LSK fraction was identical between the two genotypes (data not shown), the requirement of HIF-1α for cell cycle quiescence is mainly restricted to LT-HSCs."

It has been suggested that this results from an origin in basal breast epithelial stem cells. Here, we demonstrate that deleting Brca1 in mouse mammary epithelial luminal progenitors produces tumors that phenocopy human BRCA1 breast cancers. They also resemble the majority of sporadic basal-like breast tumors. However, directing Brca1 deficiency to basal cells generates tumors that express molecular markers of basal breast cancers but do not histologically resemble either human BRCA1 or the majority of sporadic basal-like breast tumors. These findings support a derivation of the majority of human BRCA1-associated and sporadic basal-like tumors from luminal progenitors rather than from basal stem cells. They also demonstrate that when target cells for transformation have the potential for phenotypic plasticity, tumor phenotypes may not directly reflect histogenesis. This has important implications for cancer prevention strategies. Breast cancers in BRCA1 mutation carriers frequently have a distinctive basal-like phenotype.

BRCA1 breast cancers have been suggested to develop in basal mammary stem cells Targeted Brca1 loss in stem cells did not generate human BRCA1-like tumors Brca1 loss in luminal progenitors produced tumors identical to human cancers Luminal progenitors are probably the true origin of human BRCA1 breast cancers The epithelial glandular network of the breast comprises two main cell types, outer basal cells and inner luminal cells. The majority of the basal cells are differentiated myoepithelial cells (Sleeman et al., 2007Sleeman K.E. Kendrick H. Robertson D. Isacke C.M. Ashworth A. Smalley M.J.

Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 716-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The luminal cells include differentiated milk-secreting cells (during lactation) but other functional luminal cell types can be found, such as hormone receptor-expressing cells (Sleeman et al., 2007Sleeman K.E. Kendrick H. Robertson D. Isacke C.M. Ashworth A. Smalley M.J. Dissociation of estrogen receptor expression and in vivo stem cell activity in the mammary gland.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The luminal layer is also thought to contain a number of different classes of progenitor, including progenitors for the hormone receptor-expressing cells (Booth and Smith, 2006Booth B.W. Smith G.H. Estrogen receptor-alpha and progesterone receptor are expressed in label-retaining mammary epithelial cells that divide asymmetrically and retain their template DNA strands.Breast Cancer Res. 2006; 8: R49Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and secretory cells (Oakes et al., 2008Oakes S.R.

These different epithelial lineages can be separated by flow cytometric analysis of expression levels of CD24, Sca-1, and CD49f antigens (Kendrick et al., 2008Kendrick H. Regan J.L. Magnay F.A.

Purification and unique properties of mammary epithelial stem cells.Nature. 2006; 439: 993-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). The myoepithelial cells of the basal layer are defined as CD24+/low Sca-1− CD49flow, whereas the basal stem cells are enriched in the CD24+/low Sca-1− CD49fhigh cell fraction. Luminal estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) cells have the phenotype CD24+/high Sca-1+ whereas luminal CD24+/high Sca-1− cells are largely ER− progenitors. Tissue stem cells are good candidates for the cells of origin of tumors, because their long in vivo lifespan means they can accumulate the mutations required for tumor formation (Smalley and Ashworth, 2003Smalley M. Ashworth A. Stem cells and breast cancer: A field in transit.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 832-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). It is also possible that progenitors downstream of stem cells could accumulate enough genetic lesions to generate a tumor (Dontu et al., 2003Dontu G. Al-Hajj M. Abdallah W.M. Clarke M.F. Wicha M.S. Stem cells in normal breast development and breast cancer.Cell Prolif. 2003; 36: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), depending on their rate of turnover. In breast cancer, it is proposed that different tumor subtypes (Sorlie et al., 2003Sorlie T. Tibshirani R. Parker J. Hastie T. Marron J.S. Nobel A. Deng S. Johnsen H. Pesich R. Geisler S. et al.Repeated observation of breast tumor subtypes in independent gene expression data sets.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 8418-8423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3944) Google Scholar) may originate from different classes of stem/progenitor cells, with ER− “basal-like” breast cancers originating from ER− basal stem cells and ER+ luminal breast cancers from progenitors committed to luminal ER+ differentiation (Dontu et al., 2003Dontu G. Al-Hajj M. Abdallah W.M. Clarke M.F. Wicha M.S.

An integrative hypothesis about the origin and development of sporadic and familial breast cancer subtypes.Carcinogenesis. 2008; 29: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Strikingly, the majority of breast tumors arising in carriers of germline mutations in BRCA1 have the basal-like phenotype (Lakhani et al., 2005Lakhani S.R. Reis-Filho J.S. Fulford L. Penault-Llorca F. van der Vijver M. Parry S. Bishop T. Benitez J. Rivas C.

Treat. 2005; 90: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It has therefore been proposed that loss of BRCA1 function in basal stem cells results in tumor formation associated with a block in luminal differentiation (Foulkes, 2004Foulkes W.D. BRCA1 functions as a breast stem cell regulator.J. Med. Genet. 2004; 41: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, Liu et al., 2008Liu S. Ginestier C. Charafe-Jauffret E. Foco H. Kleer C.G. Merajver S.D. Dontu G. Wicha M.S. BRCA1 regulates human mammary stem/progenitor cell fate.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, Vassilopoulos et al., 2008Vassilopoulos A. Wang R.H. Petrovas C. Ambrozak D. Koup R. Deng C.X. Identification and characterization of cancer initiating cells from BRCA1 related mammary tumors using markers for normal mammary stem cells.Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2008; 4: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In contrast, recent work showed an increase in luminal progenitor numbers in breast tissue of BRCA1 mutation carriers and a correlation between the gene expression profile of normal human luminal progenitors and basal-like breast cancers (Lim et al., 2009Lim E. Vaillant F. Wu D. Forrest N.C. Pal B. Hart A.H. Asselin-Labat M.L. Gyorki D.E. Ward T. Partanen A. et al.kConFabAberrant luminal progenitors as the candidate target population for basal tumor development in BRCA1 mutation carriers.Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). However, despite the association of aberrant luminal progenitors with BRCA1 mutations, an origin of BRCA1 breast cancers in luminal progenitors was not directly demonstrated. To achieve this, a direct comparison of the effects of creating identical tumor predisposing events in stem versus progenitor cells is required. Here we describe such a comparison. We have directed Brca1 loss of function either predominantly to basal or luminal mammary epithelial cells, thereby biasing tumor origin to basal stem cells, or to progenitors of the luminal layer. In both systems, the molecular features of the tumors that arise are similar to those of human basal-like tumors. However, only tumors originating in luminal progenitors have the same histological appearance as human BRCA1 tumors and indeed resemble the majority of human sporadic (nonfamilial) basal-like breast cancers. In contrast, Brca1 loss in basal stem cells preferentially generated malignant adenomyoepitheliomas, which are rare tumors in humans, with features consistent with a stem cell origin. Importantly, these results reconcile conflicting data from other investigators, showing that deletion of Brca1 in stem cells causes accumulation of cells with a very strong basal phenotype (Liu et al., 2008Liu S. Ginestier C. Charafe-Jauffret E. Foco H. Kleer C.G. Merajver S.D. Dontu G. Wicha M.S. BRCA1 regulates human mammary stem/progenitor cell fate.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), but only deletion of Brca1 in luminal progenitors produces tumors resembling human BRCA1 mutation-associated breast cancers (Lim et al., 2009Lim E. Vaillant F. Wu D. Forrest N.C. Pal B. Hart A.H. Asselin-Labat M.L. Gyorki D.E. Ward T. Partanen A. et al.kConFabAberrant luminal progenitors as the candidate target population for basal tumor development in BRCA1 mutation carriers.Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that malignant adenomyoepitheliomas are true stem cell tumors but, given the comparative rarity of this tumor type in humans, also highlight luminal progenitors as the key to understanding much of the etiology of breast cancer. The finding that normal mammary gland stem cells may not be common targets for transformation in the breast has important implications for strategies to treat and prevent breast cancer. We have previously described a Cre-loxP-based mouse model of breast cancer in which Cre expression was under the control of the Blg promoter and animals were put through two rounds of pregnancy to drive maximum levels of conditional allele recombination (McCarthy et al., 2007McCarthy A. Savage K. Gabriel A. Naceur C. Reis-Filho J.S. Ashworth A. A mouse model of basal-like breast carcinoma with metaplastic elements.J. Pathol. 2007; 211: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Mammary tumors developed in these mice but the cells of origin of these tumors were unknown, although the Blg promoter is thought to be mainly active in luminal cells (Naylor et al., 2005Naylor M.J. Li N. Cheung J. Lowe E.T. Lambert E. Marlow R. Wang P. Schatzmann F. Wintermantel T. Schüetz G. et al.Ablation of beta1 integrin in mammary epithelium reveals a key role for integrin in glandular morphogenesis and differentiation.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We therefore set out to define in detail the cell lineages in which Blg-Cre-mediated recombination occurs in the mammary epithelium by using Rosa26 Reporter (R26R) mice, in which Cre activity permanently switches on β-galactosidase expression. CD24+/low Sca-1− basal, CD24+/high Sca-1− luminal ER−, and CD24+/high Sca-1+ luminal ER+ mammary epithelial cells were isolated from four groups of mice: virgin Blg-Cre R26R mice at 12 weeks, 21 weeks, and 42 weeks of age and also mice that had undergone two full-term pregnancies, each followed by 3 weeks of lactation and normal weaning. These animals (hereafter termed “parous” mice) had weaned their last litter by 18 weeks of age and cells were harvested from them at 21 weeks, to allow for postweaning involution and remodeling. In each group, separated cells were cultured as single-cell clones for 10 days in vitro and then stained for β-galactosidase (R26R reporter) activity (Figure 1; Figure S1 available online). The proportion of cells in each population with colony-forming potential (progenitors) that were β-galactosidase+ (“recombined” progenitors) was calculated (see Experimental Procedures). In the 12-week-old virgin mice, the majority of colonies derived from luminal ER− cells were β-galactosidase positive, whereas very few luminal ER+-derived colonies were positive and no detectable β-galactosidase activity was found in basal-derived colonies. By 21 weeks, almost all virgin luminal ER− cell-derived colonies were β-galactosidase positive. However, approximately half of colonies derived from luminal ER+ cells were also positive and β-galactosidase activity could be detected in occasional basal cell-derived colonies. By 42 weeks, many positive colonies were seen in the virgin basal cell cultures, although this varied considerably from preparation to preparation. Interestingly, the distribution of β-galactosidase-positive colonies derived from the 21-week parous mice was almost identical to that of the 42-week virgin mice. These results demonstrated that Cre-dependent recombination saturated the luminal ER− population relatively quickly in virgin animals but also suggested that Cre-expressing progenitors from this population were contributing to estrous cycle-dependent remodeling of the tissue and regeneration of the basal and luminal ER+ cell layers. Pregnancy accelerated the accumulation of recombined cells in the basal population. In all groups, however, the Blg-Cre transgene was clearly most strongly active in the luminal ER− population. Furthermore, it was clear that at all developmental stages, the luminal ER− population contained a far higher proportion of recombined progenitors than any other population. Although Blg-Cre transgene activity resulted in conditional allele recombination in almost all progenitors in the luminal ER− population, in parous and older virgin animals recombinant alleles could be detected in cells from the basal layer, which contains the mammary stem cells. Therefore, it was still possible that basal stem cells could be the primary targets for Blg-Cre-driven tumor formation. To address this, we established cohorts of virgin and parous Blg-Cre Brca1f/f p53+/− mice and monitored them for tumor formation. The results were compared with samples from a cohort of virgin K14-Cre Brca1f/f p53+/− mice, in which Cre expression was driven by the Keratin 14 promoter. Keratin 14 (K14) is expressed in basal cells in the mouse mammary epithelium (Sleeman et al., 2006Sleeman K.E. Kendrick H. Ashworth A. Isacke C.M. Smalley M.J. CD24 staining of mouse mammary gland cells defines luminal epithelial, myoepithelial/basal and non-epithelial cells.Breast Cancer Res. 2006; 8: R7Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), although in humans, K14 can also be expressed in luminal cells (Gusterson et al., 2005Gusterson B.A. Ross D.T. Heath V.J. Stein T. Basal cytokeratins and their relationship to the cellular origin and functional classification of breast cancer.Breast Cancer Res. 2005; 7: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Importantly, K14 is expressed by human (Pece et al., 2010Pece S. Tosoni D. Confalonieri S. Mazzarol G. Vecchi M. Ronzoni S. Bernard L. Viale G. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Biological and molecular heterogeneity of breast cancers correlates with their cancer stem cell content.Cell. 2010; 140: 62-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar) and mouse (Jonkers et al., 2001Jonkers J. Meuwissen R. van der Gulden H. Peterse H. van der Valk M. Berns A. Synergistic tumor suppressor activity of BRCA2 and p53 in a conditional mouse model for breast cancer.Nat.

Dissociation of estrogen receptor expression and in vivo stem cell activity in the mammary gland.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) mammary stem cell populations. We confirmed this by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis of Krt14 gene expression in luminal ER−, luminal ER+, myoepithelial (CD24+/low Sca-1− CD49flow), and mammary stem cell-enriched (CD24+/low Sca-1− CD49fhigh) populations (Sleeman et al., 2007Sleeman K.E. Kendrick H. Robertson D. Isacke C.M. Ashworth A. Smalley M.J. Dissociation of estrogen receptor expression and in vivo stem cell activity in the mammary gland.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this demonstrated that Krt14 gene expression in mammary stem cell-enriched cells was significantly higher (1.6-fold) even than that in myoepithelial cells (Figure S2A). If recombined cells in the basal population made a significant contribution to tumor formation in the Blg-Cre animals, then parity would be expected to accelerate the rate of tumor onset as it accelerates the accumulation of these cells. However, there was no significant difference in age or rate of mammary tumor onset between virgin and parous Blg-Cre Brca1f/f p53+/− mice, with a median latency of 336 and 319 days, respectively. In contrast, onset of K14-Cre Brca1f/f p53+/− tumors was significantly faster than both Blg-Cre cohorts (log-rank test, p < 0.001), with a median latency of 249 days (Figure 2A ). All tumors except three (from the virgin Blg-Cre cohort) showed a significant (p < 0.05) reduction in p53 expression compared to spleens from wild-type animals of a similar mixed genetic background (Figure S2B). For Brca1, exon 22 expression was decreased in the majority of tumors to a greater extent than exon 19 expression, consistent with deletion of floxed exon 22 from the conditional Brca1 allele. In one tumor (K14-Cre 3265), Brca1 expression levels were increased compared to spleen. The reasons for this are unclear (Figures S2C and S2D). The phenotype of both the virgin and parous Blg-Cre Brca1f/f p53+/− tumors was similar (Figures 2B–2I; the properties of all the tumors are described in Table S1). They were classified mainly as invasive ductal carcinomas of no special type (IDC-NST), typically with central necrosis (Figure 2B; asterisk), and pushing (Figures 2B and 2C; arrows) or mixed borders. Metaplastic elements in the form of spindle and/or squamous cell metaplasia were found in 12 out of 14 cases from virgin animals and 9 out of 10 from parous animals. In one virgin tumor, chondroid metaplasia was also observed (Figure 2D; asterisk). All Blg-Cre tumors were classified as histological grade 3, displaying a high degree of nuclear pleomorphism, little or no tubule formation, and a high mitotic index, often with aberrant mitotic figures (Figure 2E, arrows). All were positive for basal K14 (Figure 2F). Ten cases from virgin animals and 10 from parous animals were positive for luminal Keratin 18 (K18) (Figure 2G), with staining for both K14 and K18 seen in both epithelioid and metaplastic spindle cells. Eight cases from virgin animals and five from parous animals were positive for the basal marker p63 (Figure 2H). Only three tumors from virgin animals and two from parous animals were ER+ (Figure 2I). In summary, these tumors displayed histological and immunohistochemical features that closely recapitulated the cardinal features of human BRCA1 breast tumors. In particular, most displayed features characteristic of the majority of human basal-like breast cancers (Rakha et al., 2008Rakha E.A. Reis-Filho J.S. Ellis I.O. Basal-like breast cancer: A critical review.J. Clin. Oncol. 2008; 26: 2568-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Compared to the Blg-Cre cohorts, the balance of tumor phenotypes in the K14-Cre Brca1f/f p53+/− tumors was reversed (Figures 2J–2O and 3A ). Only one tumor was classified as an IDC-NST but seven of the eight available for analysis were classed as adenosquamous (metaplastic) carcinoma or malignant adenomyoepithelioma (Figure 2J). In the latter, distinct malignant luminal-like and basal-like populations could be observed in an arrangement reminiscent of that of the normal mammary ductal morphology (Figure 2K), features consistent with a stem cell origin. All tumors were strongly K14 and p63 positive (Figures 2L and 2N). Seven tumors were also K18 positive (Figure 2M) but five were ER− (Figure 2O). The percentage of K14-positive cells within the tumors in the three cohorts fell into a similar range (although it tended to be slightly higher in the K14-Cre tumors) (Figure 3B). However, the percentage of K18-positive cells was higher in the parous Blg-Cre tumors compared to the K14-Cre tumors, whereas the virgin Blg-Cre tumors had a bimodal distribution of K18 staining (Figure 3B). In contrast, the percentage of p63-positive cells was higher in the K14-Cre tumors compared to the parous Blg-Cre tumors, whereas the virgin Blg-Cre tumors again had a bimodal distribution (Figure 3B). This suggested that the K14-Cre tumors had a more overt basal-like differentiation, the parous Blg-Cre tumors were more luminal-like, and the virgin Blg-Cre tumors were, as a group, intermediate between the two. Tumors from all three cohorts had a high mitotic index, which contributed to them being classified as grade 3. However, when mitotic counts were considered, parous Blg-Cre tumors were found to be slightly, but significantly (p < 0.05, unpaired two-tailed t test), more proliferative than virgin Blg-Cre tumors, with on average 145 mitotic figures (95% confidence limits, 102 to 188) and 95 mitotic figures (95% confidence limits, 72 to 118) per 10 high-power fields, respectively. Remarkably, the K14-Cre tumors were even more proliferative, with 296 mitotic figures (95% confidence limits, 218 to 373) in 10 fields (p < 0.001, unpaired two-tailed t test against parous Blg-Cre tumor data) (Figure 3B). The features of these K14-Cre tumors were, therefore, consistent with an origin in stem cells with a high proliferative potential. The profound differences in the histopathological features between tumor cohorts that vary only in the promoter used to drive gene expression are highly likely to be the result of different cells of origin. The patterns of expression of the K14 and Blg promoters within the mammary gland (Figure 1; Figure S2A; Jonkers et al., 2001Jonkers J. Meuwissen R. van der Gulden H. Peterse H. van der Valk M. Berns A. Synergistic tumor suppressor activity of BRCA2 and p53 in a conditional mouse model for breast cancer.Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar) and the comparative phenotypes of the tumors support a model in which the K14-Cre promoter biases tumor formation to basal stem cells whereas the Blg-Cre promoter biases tumor formation to progenitors in the luminal layer. To further investigate the appearance of cells with a basal-like phenotype in luminal progenitor-origin Brca1 tumors, we used flow cytometry to compare normal epithelial cells isolated from young (12-week) and aged (42-week) virgin mice with tumor cells stained for CD24, Sca-1, and CD49f expression. Changes in the proportion of CD24− nonepithelial, CD24+/low basal, and CD24+/high luminal cells (Figure 3C) as well as in numbers of cells with the basal stem cell-enriched phenotype (CD24+/low Sca-1− CD49fhigh) were quantified (Figure 3D). Both the tumors and aged virgin normal cells showed an increase in the proportion of CD24+/low cells and a decrease in CD24+/high cells compared to young normal mice. However, the tumors also showed significant enrichment for cells with a stem cell-like phenotype (CD24+/low Sca-1− CD49fhigh) as well as the appearance of a population with the phenotype CD24+/high Sca-1− CD49fhigh (Figures 3C and 3D; Figure S3A). Enrichment within the tumors for cells with a stem cell-like flow cytometry phenotype led us to speculate that they may contain a distinct population of “tumor-initiating cells” or “cancer stem cells.” Therefore, we carried out limiting dilution transplant assays on cells from virgin Blg-Cre Brca1f/f p53+/− tumors separated on the basis of levels of CD24 expression. These experiments proved technically challenging, because very few viable cells could be recovered from tumors after dissociation and flow sorting (Figure S3A). Nevertheless, we were able to carry out limiting dilution transplant series of dissociated cells from two tumors (three further samples were transplanted at limiting dilutions but failed to form any secondary tumors and so are excluded from the analysis). The results showed that tumor cells with an undifferentiated CD24− Sca-1− phenotype were most highly enriched for tumor-initiating cells, with 1 in 1949 cells having tumor-initiating potential compared to 1 in 7061 cells in the CD24+/low Sca-1− population (Table S2). It is the latter phenotype which is associated with the stem cell population in normal mammary epithelium, so this demonstrated that in tumors the stem cell surface marker phenotype does not necessarily correlate with functional potential. During this analysis, we collected extensive data on the flow cytometric profiles of primary, secondary, and tertiary transplanted tumors. Remarkably, they were very different, with at least four different types of profile observed (Figure 3E). There was no correlation between the type of profile and the tumor subpopulation from which the new generation of tumor had been grown. Rather, the profiles suggested that clonal selection was occurring, possibly within a pool of cancer stem cell-like cells (Marusyk and Polyak, 2010Marusyk A. Polyak K. Tumor heterogeneity: Causes and consequences.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1805: 105-117PubMed Google Scholar). We examined whether the balance of mammary epithelial populations was altered in Blg-Cre mice carrying floxed Brca1 alleles at an age where recombination has occurred only in the luminal ER− progenitor population but prior to tumor formation (10–12 weeks). There were no significant differences (two-tailed t test on Log10 transformed data) between the proportions of basal and luminal ER+ cells in mice with various combinations of Brca1 and p53 alleles compared to each other or control Blg-Cre R26R mice. However, Blg-Cre Brca1f/f p53+/− animals had a significantly reduced (two-tailed t test on Log10 transformed data, p < 0.05) proportion of luminal ER− cells compared to Blg-Cre Brca1f/+ p53+/− animals (Figure S3C). The significance of this is unclear, however, because in neither genotype was the proportion of luminal ER− cells significantly different to wild-type. Nevertheless, the results do support the luminal ER− progenitor population as the primary target of Blg-Cre activity. To determine whether the basal-like differentiation observed by histopathology and flow cytometry in luminal origin Blg-Cre Brca1f/f p53+/− tumors was reflected at the molecular level, the gene expression profiles of 12 virgin and 6 parous Blg-Cre Brca1f/f p53+/− tumors and 3 K14-Cre Brca1f/f p53+/− tumors were analyzed.

https://openalex.org/W2164577763,"Thyroid hormones have widespread cellular effects; however it is unclear whether their effects on the central nervous system (CNS) contribute to global energy balance. Here we demonstrate that either whole-body hyperthyroidism or central administration of triiodothyronine (T3) decreases the activity of hypothalamic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), increases sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity and upregulates thermogenic markers in brown adipose tissue (BAT). Inhibition of the lipogenic pathway in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) prevents CNS-mediated activation of BAT by thyroid hormone and reverses the weight loss associated with hyperthyroidism. Similarly, inhibition of thyroid hormone receptors in the VMH reverses the weight loss associated with hyperthyroidism. This regulatory mechanism depends on AMPK inactivation, as genetic inhibition of this enzyme in the VMH of euthyroid rats induces feeding-independent weight loss and increases expression of thermogenic markers in BAT. These effects are reversed by pharmacological blockade of the SNS. Thus, thyroid hormone-induced modulation of AMPK activity and lipid metabolism in the hypothalamus is a major regulator of whole-body energy homeostasis."

In Parkinson disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), filamentous inclusions consisting of hyperphosphorylated α-synuclein (α-syn) are accumulated in degenerating neurons (5Fujiwara H.

The identification of genetic defects associated with early onset AD, familial PD, frontotemporal dementia, parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (caused by Tau mutation and deposition), and familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease has led to the hypothesis that the production and aggregation of these proteins are central to the development of neurodegeneration.

It therefore seems appropriate to consider neurodegenerative disorders developing intracellular deposits of amyloid-like proteins as brain amyloidosis. The accumulation and propagation of extracellular amyloid proteins are believed to occur through nucleation-dependent polymerization (12Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Annu. Rev.

However, it has been difficult to establish the relevance of this process in the in vivo situation because of the lack of a suitable cell culture model or method to effectively introduce seeds into cells. For example, it has not yet been possible to generate bona fide fibrous inclusions reminiscent of Lewy bodies as a model of PD by overexpressing α-syn in neurons of transgenic animals. Here, we describe a novel method for introducing amyloid seeds into cultured cells using lipofection, and we present experimental evidence of seed-dependent polymerization of α-syn, leading to the formation of filamentous protein deposits and cell death. This was also clearly demonstrated in cells expressing different Tau isoforms by introducing the corresponding Tau fibril seeds.

A phosphorylation-independent antibody Syn102 and monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against a synthetic phosphopeptide of α-syn (Ser(P)129) were used as described previously (5Fujiwara H.

Polyclonal anti-ubiquitin antibody was obtained from Dako. Polyclonal anti-Tau Ser(P)396 was obtained from Calbiochem. Monoclonal anti-α-tubulin and anti-HA clone HA-7 were obtained from Sigma. Lipofectamine was purchased from Invitrogen. Monoclonal anti-Tau T46 was from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. AT100 and HT7 antibodies were obtained from Innogenetics. Human α-syn cDNA in bacterial expression plasmid pRK172 was used to produce recombinant protein (14Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Wild-type (WT) or carboxyl-terminally HA-tagged α-syn was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and purified as described (15Nonaka T. Iwatsubo T. Hasegawa M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To obtain α-syn fibrils, α-syn (5–10 mg/ml) was incubated at 37 °C for 4 days with continuous shaking. The samples were diluted with 5 volumes of 30 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) and ultracentrifuged at 110,000 × g for 20 min at 25 °C. The pellets were resuspended in 30 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) and sonicated twice for 5 s each. The protein concentration was determined as described, and this preparation was used as Seed αS. In the case of α-syn oligomers, α-syn (10 mg/ml) was incubated at 37 °C for 3 days in the presence of 10 mm exifone. After incubation, the mixture was ultracentrifuged at 110,000 × g for 20 min at 25 °C. The supernatant was desalted by Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Biosciences) column chromatography, and eluted fractions (α-syn oligomers) were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblot analysis. Recombinant human three-repeat Tau isoform with one amino-terminal insert (3R1N) and four-repeat Tau isoform with one amino-terminal insert (4R1N) monomer and corresponding fibrils were prepared as described previously (16Aoyagi H.

Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells obtained from ATCC were cultured in DMEM/F-12 medium with 10% FCS. Cells at ∼30–50% confluence in 6-well plates were treated with 200 μl of Opti-MEM containing 2 μg of the seed α-syn WT (Seed αS); HA-tagged α-syn (Seed-HA); α-syn monomers, oligomers; or Tau 3R1N or 4R1N fibrils; and 5 μl of Lipofectamine (LA) for 3 h at 37 °C. The medium was changed to DMEM/F-12, and culture was continued for 14 h. The cells were collected by treatment with 0.5 ml of 0.25% trypsin for 10 min at 37 °C, followed by centrifugation (1,800 × g, 5 min) and washing with PBS. The cellular proteins were extracted with 100 μl of homogenization buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and a mixture of protease inhibitors by sonication. After ultracentrifugation at 290,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected as a Tris-soluble fraction, and the protein concentration was determined by BCA assay. The pellet was solubilized in 100 μl of SDS-sample buffer. Both Tris-soluble and insoluble fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting with appropriate antibodies as indicated (15Nonaka T. Iwatsubo T.

Under our experimental conditions, the efficiency of transfection with pEGFP-C1 vector was 20–30%. The cells were washed with PBS once, and then Seed αS, Seed-HA, Seed 3R1N, or Seed 4R1N was introduced with Lipofectamine as described above. The medium was changed to DMEM/F-12, and culture was continued for ∼2–3 days. Cells were harvested in the presence of trypsin to digest extracellular cell-associated α-syn fibrils. The cellular proteins were differentially extracted and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies, as described (18Nonaka T. Kametani F. Arai T. Akiyama H. Hasegawa M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 3353-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). SH-SY5Y cells on coverslips were transfected with pcDNA3-α-syn and cultured for 14 h as described above, and then Seed αS was introduced, and culture was continued for ∼1–2 days. After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, the cells were stained with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies as described previously (18Nonaka T. Kametani F. Arai T. Akiyama H. Hasegawa M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 3353-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). For thioflavin S staining, the cells were incubated with 0.05% thioflavin S at room temperature for 5 min. Fluorescence was analyzed with a laser-scanning confocal fluorescence microscope (LSM5Pascal, Carl Zeiss). For electron microscopy, cells overexpressing α-syn were transfected with Seed αS, cultured for 2 days, fixed in 0.1 m phosphate buffer containing 4% glutaraldehyde for 12 h, and then processed and embedded in LR White resin (London Resin, Reading, UK). Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate for investigation. Immunolabeling of the inclusions was performed by means of an immunogold-based postembedding procedure. Sections were blocked with 10% calf serum, incubated overnight on grids with anti-Ser(P)129 antibody at a dilution of 1:100, rinsed, then reacted with secondary antibody conjugated to 10-nm gold particles (E-Y Laboratories, San Mateo, CA) (1:10), rinsed again and stained with uranyl acetate. Immunoelectron microscopic analysis of α-syn or Tau filaments extracted from cells was performed as follows. Cells overexpressing α-syn or Tau were transfected with Seed αS or Seed Tau, respectively. After incubation for 3 days, they were harvested, suspended in 200 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 10% sucrose, 0.8 m NaCl) and sonicated. The lysates were centrifuged at 20,400 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was recovered, and Sarkosyl was added (final 1%, v/v). The mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and then centrifuged at 113,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting pellets were suspended in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, placed on collodion-coated 300-mesh copper grids, and stained with the indicated antibodies and 2% (v/v) phosphotungstate. Micrographs were recorded on a JEOL 1200EX electron microscope. Cell death assay was performed using a CytoTox 96 non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay kit (Promega). TUNEL staining was performed using an in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science). SH-SY5Y cells transfected with pcDNA3-α-syn and Seed αS were cultured for 3 days or treated with 20 μm MG132 for 4 h. Cells were harvested, and cytosolic fraction was prepared as follows. Cells were resuspended in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and disrupted by sonication, and then insoluble material was removed by ultracentrifugation at 290,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was assayed for proteasome activity by using a fluorescent peptide substrate, benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Glu-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Peptide Institute, Inc.). 7-Amino-4-methylcoumarin release was measured fluorometrically (excitation at 365 nm; emission at 460 nm). In a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter assay of proteasome activity in living cells by confocal laser microscopy, SH-SY5Y cells transfected with pcDNA3-α-syn (1 μg) and GFP-CL1 (0.3 μg) using FuGENE6 and then transfected with Seed αS were grown on coverslips for 2 days or treated with 20 μm MG132 for 6 h (19Nonaka T. Hasegawa M. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 8014-8022Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These cells were analyzed using a laser-scanning confocal fluorescence microscope (LSM5Pascal, Carl Zeiss). The p values for the description of the statistical significance of differences were calculated by means of the unpaired, two-tailed Student's t test using GraphPad Prism 4 software (GraphPad Software). Cellular overexpression of α-syn by itself does not lead to fibrillization of α-syn in a form that resembles Lewy bodies. This prompted us to examine whether or not introduction of preformed aggregation seeds of α-syn (Seed αS) would elicit fibril formation. To introduce Seed αS into SH-SY5Y cells in a non-invasive manner, we tried several reagents used for transporting proteins or plasmid DNA into cells and found that LA, a cationic gene introducer, enables the introduction of Seed αS into SH-SY5Y cells. We were not able to detect any introduced α-syn monomer or fibrils following the simple addition of protein preparations to the culture medium, notwithstanding a previous report on this approach (20Sung J.Y. Kim J. Paik S.R. Park J.H. Ahn Y.S. Chung K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27441-27448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The insoluble α-syn formed following LA-mediated Seed αS introduction was detected as buffer-insoluble α-syn in cell lysates (Fig. 1A). The insoluble α-syn was phosphorylated at Ser129 upon introduction into cells (Fig. 1A), indicating that Seed αS was incorporated in cells and phosphorylated intracellularly. Cells were harvested in the presence of trypsin to digest extracellular cell-associated α-syn fibrils. The optimal ratio of LA to Seed αS was about 5 μl to 2 μg of protein in 6-well plates. This treatment effectively introduced Seed αS not only into SH-SY5Y cells but also into several other types of cells examined, including Chinese hamster ovary cells and human embryonic kidney 293T cells (data not shown). In sharp contrast, soluble α-syn (either monomeric or oligomeric forms) was not introduced into the cells by the same treatment (Figs. 1A and 4), suggesting that the LA treatment works exclusively for the internalization of insoluble α-syn aggregates.FIGURE 4α-Syn oligomers were not introduced into cultured cells. A and B, α-Syn oligomers were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Oligomeric α-syn protein incubated with (47.8 μg of protein) or without exifone (30 μg of protein) was analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC (Aquapore RP-300 column) (A). These samples (0.2 μg of protein of each) were also analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-Syn102 (B). C and D, cells were transfected with empty plasmid (none) or pcDNA3-αsyn (αsyn) and then treated with or without α-syn oligomer (Oligomer αS, 5 μg) or fibrils (Seed αS, 2 μg). After incubation for 3 days, cells were harvested, and immunoblot analyses were performed. Proteins differentially extracted from the cells with Tris-HCl (TS), Triton X-100 (TX), Sarkosyl (Sar), and the pellet (ppt) were probed using anti-Syn102 (C) and anti-Ser(P)129 (PSer129) (D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These results strongly suggest that α-syn fibrils are incorporated with the aid of LA but do not exclude the possibility that extracellular α-syn fibrils may induce aggregation of endogenous α-syn without incorporation. To confirm that the extracellular α-syn fibril seeds are internalized into cells by LA, we performed the transduction of preformed carboxyl-terminally HA-tagged α-syn fibril seeds (Seed-HA) instead of non-tagged α-syn seeds. As shown in Fig. 1, B and C, time course experiments revealed that Seed-HA was also incorporated into cells in the presence of LA and could be detected with both anti-HA antibody and a phospho-α-syn-specific antibody (anti-Ser(P)129), even 3 days after infection. Confocal microscopic analyses also indicated that Seed-HA was phosphorylated at Ser129 intracellularly. All anti-Ser(P)129-positive dotlike structures were also stained with anti-HA, indicating that no endogenously phosphorylated α-syn aggregates are present in the cells (Fig. 1D and supplemental Fig. S1C). Although introduction of the seed α-syn into cells was accompanied with phosphorylation, no further dramatic change was observed. Because the level of endogenous α-syn was relatively low in SH-SY5Y cells, we introduced non-tagged or HA-tagged seeds into cells transiently overexpressing α-syn. After 3 days of culture, immunocytochemistry for α-syn revealed a diffuse (Fig. 2B) or dotlike (Fig. 2C) pattern of cytoplasmic labeling by anti-Ser(P)129 in cells transfected with wild-type α-syn without seeds or in non-overexpressing cells with Seed αS, respectively. Surprisingly, however, in cells transfected with both pcDNA3-α-syn and Seed αS, we observed abundant round inclusions that occupied the cytoplasm and displaced the nucleus, with morphology highly reminiscent of cortical-type Lewy bodies observed in human brain (Fig. 2D). The size of the α-syn-positive inclusions was ∼10 μm in diameter (Fig. 2D), which is similar to that of the Lewy bodies detected in the brains of patients with dementia with Lewy bodies. Similarly, when cells expressing α-syn were transfected with Seed-HA, abundant phosphorylated α-syn-positive cells were also detected (supplemental Fig. S1D). We next examined the status of ubiquitin, which is positive in most types of intracellular filamentous inclusions, including Lewy bodies, in neurodegenerative disease brains. As shown in Fig. 2E, we found that almost all intracellular inclusions labeled with anti-Ser(P)129 were also positive for ubiquitin, as is the case for Lewy bodies in the cortex of human DLB brain (Fig. 2F). Furthermore, the juxtanuclear Ser(P)129-positive, Lewy body-like inclusions were also positively labeled with thioflavin S, a fluorescent dye that specifically intercalates within structures rich in β-pleated sheet conformation (Fig. 2, G and H), indicating that the inclusions contain β-sheet-rich filamentous aggregates. Electron microscopic analysis of cells transfected with both wild-type α-syn and the seeds revealed that the inclusions are composed of filamentous structures ∼10 nm in diameter that are often covered with granular materials (Fig. 2, I and J). The filamentous structures were randomly oriented within the cytoplasm of these cells, forming a meshwork-like profile, and were frequently intermingled with mitochondria (Fig. 2, I and J), being highly reminiscent of human cortical Lewy bodies. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that the filaments were densely decorated with anti-Ser(P)129 (Fig. 2K), demonstrating that they were composed of phosphorylated α-syn. To biochemically validate this cellular model and to investigate further the molecular mechanisms underlying nucleation-dependent aggregation within cells, we differentially extracted α-syn from these cells using detergents of various strengths and analyzed the extracts by immunoblotting with anti-Syn102 and -Ser(P)129 antibodies. The levels of α-syn in the Sarkosyl-soluble and -insoluble fractions (total α-syn and α-syn phosphorylated at Ser129, respectively) were dramatically increased in cells transfected with both wild-type α-syn and the seeds (WT + Seed αS in Fig. 3, A and B). To distinguish endogenous α-syn from exogenous α-syn fibrils, we used LA to transduce Seed-HA into cells overexpressing α-syn. Immunoblot analyses of these cells showed that HA-tagged α-syn with slower mobility than non-tagged α-syn was detected in the Sarkosyl-insoluble pellets as phosphorylated forms by anti-HA and anti-Ser(P)129 antibodies in cells treated with Seed-HA + LA (Fig. 3, C–E). Interestingly, in cells expressing α-syn (WT) treated with Seed-HA + LA, much more abundant non-tagged α-syn was detected in the Triton X-100- and Sarkosyl-insoluble fractions as phosphorylated forms with a smaller amount of the HA-α-syn. We also performed a dose dependence experiment with Seed-HA in cells expressing α-syn. As shown in supplemental Fig. S2, immunoreactive levels of Triton X-100-insoluble phosphorylated α-syn increased in parallel with an increase in the amount of Seed-HA. Furthermore, we tested whether Tau protein forms intracellular aggregates in the presence of α-syn seeds instead of Tau seeds. We found that Tau was not aggregated with Seed-HA, confirming that intracellular aggregate formation of soluble α-syn is specific to and dependent on fibril seeds of the same protein (supplemental Fig. S3). This nucleation-dependent polymerization of α-syn in cells was greater at 3 days than at 1 day after transduction of the seeds (Fig. 3F). Negative stain electron microscopic observation of Sarkosyl-insoluble fractions of the cells harboring inclusions revealed anti-Syn102 and Ser(P)129-positive filaments of ∼5–10-nm width (Fig. 3, G and H) that are highly reminiscent of those derived from human α-synucleinopathy brains (21Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Hasegawa M. Goedert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 6469-6473Crossref PubMed Scopus (2443) Google Scholar). Such filaments were never detected in the Sarkosyl-insoluble fraction of cells solely overexpressing α-syn (data not shown). These results indicated that the biochemical characteristics of α-syn accumulated in cells forming the Lewy body-like inclusions were very similar to those of α-syn deposited in the brains of patients with α-synucleinopathies, including PD and DLB. Because the idea has been gaining ground that transient oligomers, rather than mature fibrils, are responsible for cytotoxicity, we examined whether soluble oligomers could be introduced into cells in the same manner as fibril seeds by means of LA treatment and whether they could function as seeds for intracellular α-syn aggregate formation. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, we purified stable α-syn oligomers from recombinant α-syn treated with exifone, an inhibitor of in vitro α-syn aggregation, which is thought to inhibit filament formation of α-syn by stabilizing SDS-resistant soluble oligomers (22Conway K.A. Rochet J.C. Bieganski R.M. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Science. 2001; 294: 1346-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 23Masuda M. Suzuki N. Taniguchi S. Oikawa T. Nonaka T. Iwatsubo T. Hisanaga S. Goedert M. Hasegawa M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 6085-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Then cells expressing α-syn or mock plasmid were treated with a mixture of the oligomer fraction (5 μg) and LA and incubated for 3 days. Immunoblot analyses of lysates of these cells did not detect any SDS-resistant soluble oligomeric α-syn, and the levels of phosphorylated α-syn in the Sarkosyl-soluble and -insoluble fractions showed no increase (Fig. 4, C and D). On the other hand, we observed phosphorylated and deposited α-syn in the Sarkosyl-soluble and -insoluble fractions in cells expressing α-syn treated with Seed αS (Fig. 4, C and D). These results showed that SDS-resistant soluble oligomer of α-syn could not be introduced into cultured cells in the same manner as monomeric α-syn and/or could not function as seeds for intracellular α-syn aggregation. To investigate further the nucleation-dependent polymerization of α-syn, we analyzed the polymerization of α-syn mutated or truncated at various residues or subdomains that are believed to be crucial for its aggregation. Overexpression of A53T familial Parkinson mutant α-syn, which is readily fibrillogenic in vitro, in the presence of Seed αS moderately increased the accumulation and phosphorylation of α-syn in the Sarkosyl-soluble and insoluble fractions compared with those in cells with wild-type α-syn expression and Seed αS (Fig. 5, A and B). In contrast, overexpression of Δ11 mutant α-syn, an assembly-incompetent mutant lacking residues 73–83, which have been shown to be essential for fibril formation of α-syn (24Giasson B.I. Murray I.V. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2380-2386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), elicited neither deposition nor phosphorylation of α-syn. We next introduced α-syn into SH-SY5Y cells expressing S129A mutant α-syn and observed slightly lower levels of Sarkosyl-insoluble α-syn compared with those in cells with wild-type α-syn expression and Seed αS. However, the frequency of inclusion bodies observed in seed-transduced cells expressing S129A was similar to that in seed-transfected cells expressing wild-type α-syn (data not shown), suggesting that phosphorylation at Ser129 is not required for the nucleation-dependent polymerization of α-syn within cells. SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing α-syn started to show marked clumping suggestive of cellular degeneration and death by ∼48 h after introduction of seeds (Fig. 6B). Quantitative analysis of cell death by a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay at 72 h after introduction of Seed αS showed that cells overexpressing wild-type, A30P, A53T, or S129A α-syn released ∼30% of total LDH from total cell lysate, whereas only ∼12% of LDH was released from cells expressing Δ11 mutant α-syn, which lacks polymerization ability. In control cells transfected with empty vector or pcDNA3-α-syn followed by treatment with Lipofectamine without seeds, only ∼7% of LDH was released (Fig. 6C). These results suggest a close correlation between the seed-dependent aggregation of α-syn and cell death. However, the dying cells transfected with fibrillization-competent α-syn and seeds did not show typical morphological changes of apoptosis (e.g. nuclear fragmentation, positive TUNEL staining (supplemental Fig. S4A), or activation of caspase-3 (supplemental Fig. S4B)), suggesting that they did not undergo typical apoptotic cell death, despite a previous report that exposure to neuron-derived extracellular α-syn may cause apoptosis (25Desplats P.

Even neurons of the same molecular type have notable intrinsic differences. Largely unknown, however, is the degree to which these differences impair or assist neural coding. We examined the outputs from a single type of neuron, the mitral cells of the mouse olfactory bulb, to identical stimuli and found that each cell's spiking response was dictated by its unique biophysical fingerprint. Using this intrinsic heterogeneity, diverse populations were able to code for twofold more information than their homogeneous counterparts. In addition, biophysical variability alone reduced pair-wise output spike correlations to low levels. Our results indicate that intrinsic neuronal diversity is important for neural coding and is not simply the result of biological imprecision."

Here we investigate whether Jak/Stat3 may also contribute to induction of pluripotency. EpiSCs derived from postimplantation embryos express low levels of Lif receptor and Stat3. We introduced into EpiSCs a Jak/Stat3 activating receptor (GY118F) responsive to granulocyte colony stimulating factor (Gcsf). On transfer to ground state culture, in which MAPK signaling and glycogen synthase kinase are inhibited, Gcsf induced transcriptional resetting and functional reprogramming. Activation of a tamoxifen-regulatable fusion, Stat3ER(T2), also converted EpiSCs into chimera-competent iPSCs. We exploited GY118F to increase Jak/Stat3 activity during somatic cell reprogramming. Incompletely reprogrammed cells derived from neural stem cells or fibroblasts responded to Gcsf with elevated frequencies of progression to ground state pluripotency. These findings indicate that Jak/Stat3 participate directly in molecular reprogramming and that activation of this pathway is a limiting component."
https://openalex.org/W2058536420,"Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) have critical roles in regulating the metastasis of aggressive breast cancers, yet the impact of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced by TGF-β in altering the response of breast cancer cells to EGF remains unknown. We show in this study that murine metastatic 4T1 breast cancer cells formed compact and dense spheroids when cultured under three-dimensional (3D) conditions, which was in sharp contrast to the branching phenotypes exhibited by their nonmetastatic counterparts. Using the human MCF10A series, we show that epithelial-type and nonmetastatic breast cancer cells were unable to invade to EGF, whereas their mesenchymal-type and metastatic counterparts readily invaded to EGF. Furthermore, EMT induced by TGF-β was sufficient to manifest dense spheroid morphologies, a phenotype that increased primary tumor exit and invasion to EGF. Post-EMT invasion to EGF was dependent on increased activation of EGF receptor (EGFR) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, all of which could be abrogated either by pharmacologic (PF-562271) or by genetic (shRNA) targeting of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Mechanistically, EMT induced by TGF-β increased cell-surface levels of EGFR and prevented its physical interaction with E-cadherin, leading instead to the formation of oncogenic signaling complexes with TβR-II. Elevated EGFR expression was sufficient to transform normal mammary epithelial cells, and to progress their 3D morphology from that of hollow acini to branched structures characteristic of nonmetastatic breast cancer cells. Importantly, we show that TGF-β stimulation of EMT enabled this EGFR-driven breast cancer model to abandon their inherent branching architecture and form large, undifferentiated masses that were hyperinvasive to EGF and showed increased pulmonary tumor growth upon tail vein injection. Finally, chemotherapeutic targeting of FAK was sufficient to revert the aggressive behaviors of these structures. Collectively, this investigation has identified a novel EMT-based approach to neutralize the oncogenic activities of EGF and TGF-β in aggressive and invasive forms of breast cancer."

Gene expression is regulated in part by protein transcription factors that bind target regulatory DNA sequences. Predicting DNA binding sites and affinities from transcription factor sequence or structure is difficult; therefore, experimental data are required to link transcription factors to target sequences. We present a microfluidics-based approach for de novo discovery and quantitative biophysical characterization of DNA target sequences. We validated our technique by measuring sequence preferences for 28 Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factors with a variety of DNA-binding domains, including several that have proven difficult to study by other techniques. For each transcription factor, we measured relative binding affinities to oligonucleotides covering all possible 8-bp DNA sequences to create a comprehensive map of sequence preferences; for four transcription factors, we also determined absolute affinities. We expect that these data and future use of this technique will provide information essential for understanding transcription factor specificity, improving identification of regulatory sites and reconstructing regulatory interactions."

Despite several studies identifying in vivo target genes, the precise mechanism by which Myc regulates pluripotency remains unknown. Here we report that codeletion of c- and N-MYC in iPSCs and ESCs results in their spontaneous differentiation to primitive endoderm. We show that Myc sustains pluripotency through repression of the primitive endoderm master regulator GATA6, while also contributing to cell cycle control by regulation of the mir-17-92 miRNA cluster.

https://openalex.org/W2080902551,"The 7-methylguanosine cap structure at the 5' end of eukaryotic messenger RNAs is a critical determinant of their stability and translational efficiency. It is generally believed that 5'-end capping is a constitutive process that occurs during mRNA maturation and lacks the need for a quality-control mechanism to ensure its fidelity. We recently reported that the yeast Rai1 protein has pyrophosphohydrolase activity towards mRNAs lacking a 5'-end cap. Here we show that, in vitro as well as in yeast cells, Rai1 possesses a novel decapping endonuclease activity that can also remove the entire cap structure dinucleotide from an mRNA. This activity is targeted preferentially towards mRNAs with unmethylated caps in contrast to the canonical decapping enzyme, Dcp2, which targets mRNAs with a methylated cap. Capped but unmethylated mRNAs generated in yeast cells with a defect in the methyltransferase gene are more stable in a rai1-gene-disrupted background. Moreover, rai1Δ yeast cells with wild-type capping enzymes show significant accumulation of mRNAs with 5'-end capping defects under nutritional stress conditions of glucose starvation or amino acid starvation. These findings provide evidence that 5'-end capping is not a constitutive process that necessarily always proceeds to completion and demonstrates that Rai1 has an essential role in clearing mRNAs with aberrant 5'-end caps. We propose that Rai1 is involved in an as yet uncharacterized quality control process that ensures mRNA 5'-end integrity by an aberrant-cap-mediated mRNA decay mechanism."

Previous studies suggest that exogenous cell-permeable C6 ceramide may be a useful adjunct to the anti-tumor effects of chemotherapeutic agents (such as Taxol) against multiple cancers. Here we demonstrate that exogenous cell-permeable C6 ceramide largely sensitizes multiple progressive cancer cell lines to Doxorubicin-induced cell death and apoptosis. We found for the first time that Doxorubicin induces AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation in a reactive oxygen species-dependent manner. Activation of AMPK contributes to Doxorubicin-induced cancer cell death and apoptosis. Inhibition of AMPK by small interfering RNA knockdown or a pharmacological inhibitor reduces Doxorubicin-induced cancer cell apoptosis, whereas AMPK activator AICAR enhances it. Importantly, we found that C6 ceramide largely enhances Doxorubicin-induced activation of AMPK, which leads to mTOR complex 1 inhibition and chemo-sensitization.

There is still limited insight into the molecular mechanisms that maintain the chemotherapy-resistant phenotype, despite the obvious clinical relevance that such knowledge would have. In this study, we show that the chemotherapy-resistant phenotype of myeloid leukemia cells correlates with activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway, whereas in chemosensitive cells, such activation is less pronounced. Importantly, the overexpression of Hh pathway components induces chemoprotection and inhibition of the pathway reverts chemoresistance of Lucena-1 cells, apparently by interfering with P-glycoprotein-dependent drug resistance. Our data thus identify the Hh pathway as an essential component of multidrug resistance (MDR) myeloid leukemia and suggest that targeting the Hh pathway might be an interesting therapeutic avenue for overcoming MDR resistance in myeloid leukemia."

Molecular markers that characterize motor neuron subtypes anticipate the functional properties of these neurons in vivo: ESC-derived motor neurons grafted isochronically into chick spinal cord settle in appropriate columnar domains and select axonal trajectories with a fidelity that matches that of their in vivo generated counterparts.

Most tissues contain a limited cellular repertoire, but even so, their generation from stem cells in vitro has remained a challenge, largely because of an incomplete understanding of relevant pathways of differentiation. The problem of cell specification is especially daunting in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), where hundreds of primary neuronal classes are generated, many of which are further diversified into subtypes. The CNS contains, for example, a dozen or so dopaminergic neuronal classes, about two dozen retinal ganglion and amacrine neuronal subtypes, several dozen spinal motor neuron subtypes, and hundreds of receptor-specific olfactory sensory neurons (Buck and Axel, 1991Buck L.

The diversity of CNS neurons contributes to the richness of central circuits and their encoded behaviors and can correlate with, or confer selective neuronal vulnerability in, neurodegenerative diseases. Of many classes of neurons known to exhibit subtype diversity, programs of spinal motor neuron diversification have been characterized in particular detail (Dasen and Jessell, 2009Dasen J.S.

The overall program of spinal motor neuron diversification can be deconstructed into a series of developmental steps, in which “generic” motor neurons progressively acquire subtype identities that match features of their muscle targets (Dasen et al., 2003Dasen J.S.

Initially, motor neurons acquire columnar identities—median (MMC), hypaxial (HMC), or lateral (LMC)—that dictate their settling positions in the ventral spinal cord as well as the selection of axial, body wall, or limb muscles as innervation targets. LMC neurons then acquire divisional identities that dictate the innervation of ventral or dorsal limb muscles, respectively (Kania et al., 2000Kania A. Johnson R.L. Jessell T.M.

Finally, LMC neurons acquire diverse motor pool identities that direct their connections to specific muscles in the limb (Dasen et al., 2005Dasen J.S. Tice B.C. Brenner-Morton S. Jessell T.M. A Hox regulatory network establishes motor neuron pool identity and target-muscle connectivity.Cell. 2005; 123: 477-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The existence of dozens of muscle groups in the limbs of most mammals demands an equivalent diversity of motor neuron pool subtypes. The high degree of LMC diversification makes this a potentially informative population with which to resolve strategies of neuronal subtype specification from embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Prior studies have shown that mouse and human ESCs can be converted into spinal motor neurons of generic character, through a program of retinoid and Sonic hedgehog (Shh) exposure (Lee et al., 2007Lee H.

But ESC-derived motor neurons generated under these conditions exhibit a rostral cervical, MMC-like identity (Soundararajan et al., 2006Soundararajan P. Miles G.B. Rubin L.L. Brownstone R.M.

And if so, do these specialized motor neuron subtypes express molecular and functional characteristics that reflect those of their in vivo generated counterparts? The emergence of LMC columnar, divisional, and motor pool identities is controlled by the interplay between retinoid and FGF signals and a Hox transcriptional response network (Dasen et al., 2003Dasen J.S.

At forelimb levels, LMC columnar identity requires the induction of Hox6 expression by low-level FGF signaling (Dasen et al., 2003Dasen J.S. Liu J.P. Jessell T.M. Motor neuron columnar fate imposed by sequential phases of Hox-c activity.Nature. 2003; 425: 926-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The later emergence of divisional identity within the LMC is directed by paracrine sources of retinoids that promote lateral LMC fate (Sockanathan and Jessell, 1998Sockanathan S. Jessell T.M. Motor neuron-derived retinoid signaling specifies the subtype identity of spinal motor neurons.Cell. 1998; 94: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In contrast, the diversification of motor pools at a single segmental level has been suggested to depend on the cell-by-cell resolution of an intrinsic Hox repressor network (Dasen et al., 2005Dasen J.S. Tice B.C. Brenner-Morton S. Jessell T.M. A Hox regulatory network establishes motor neuron pool identity and target-muscle connectivity.Cell. 2005; 123: 477-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Once established, these motor neuron transcriptional programs govern the settling position, axonal trajectory, and trophic factor sensitivity of LMC neuronal subsets. With this developmental program as a guide, we have been able to define conditions under which ESCs can be differentiated into motor neurons with LMC columnar, divisional, and pool identities, in the absence of any added inductive factors. We also provide evidence that the emergence of LMC divisional and pool identity in individual neurons can occur independently of signals provided by other LMC neurons, and probably by any limb-level-specific signals. Most critically, we use isotopic and isochronic grafts of ESC-derived LMC neurons into host spinal cord to show that the transcriptional profile of ESC-derived LMC neuron subsets predicts their settling position within the lateral motor column, their axonal trajectory to the forelimb, and their sensitivity to target-derived inductive factors. Mouse ESCs exposed to retinoic acid (RA) and Hedgehog (Hh) receptor agonists generate motor neurons that exhibit rostral cervical identity (Wichterle et al., 2002Wichterle H. Lieberam I. Porter J.A. Jessell T.M. Directed differentiation of embryonic stem cells into motor neurons.Cell. 2002; 110: 385-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to define differentiation conditions that promote the generation of motor neurons of brachial LMC character. In vivo, brachial LMC identity is achieved by exposure of cells to FGF signals and evasion of the rostralizing influence of retinoids (Figure S1A available online; Dasen et al., 2003Dasen J.S.

Accordingly, we tested whether omission of RA from the culture medium would promote formation of brachial level motor neurons from ESCs. We cultured ESCs at low density, to minimize the influence of BMP signals that suppress specification of neural fate (Figure S1K; Watanabe et al., 2005Watanabe K. Kamiya D. Nishiyama A. Katayama T. Nozaki S. Kawasaki H. Watanabe Y. Mizuseki K. Sasai Y. Directed differentiation of telencephalic precursors from embryonic stem cells.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 288-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). By using this low-density, retinoid-free culture condition, we screened a series of basal media and supplements for their ability to promote the generation of GFP+ motor neurons from Hb9-GFP (HBG3) ESCs (Wichterle et al., 2002Wichterle H. Lieberam I. Porter J.A. Jessell T.M. Directed differentiation of embryonic stem cells into motor neurons.Cell. 2002; 110: 385-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar). We found that Advanced D-MEM/F12/Neurobasal medium supplemented with 10% KnockOut Serum Replacement (referred to as caudalizing/ventralizing [CV] medium) resulted in the generation of spinal motor neurons of brachial LMC character. With this CV differentiation condition, motor neurons constituted 8% ± 1% (mean ± SEM; n = 3 independent experiments) of cells in embryoid bodies, an efficiency 4- to 5-fold lower than that typically obtained through the use of RA/Hh inductive signals (Table S1). To define the rostrocaudal positional identity of CV differentiated Hb9:GFP+ motor neurons, we analyzed their Hox protein expression status. 15% ± 2% of ESC-derived motor neurons expressed Hoxa5, 28% ± 8% expressed Hoxc6, 64% ± 2% expressed Hoxc8, and 25% ± 6% expressed Hoxc9 (Figures 1B and 1D ; see Table S2 for quantification). The vast majority of CV-generated ESC-derived motor neurons exhibited mutually exclusive expression of Hoxa5 and Hoxc8, and of Hoxc6 with Hoxc9 (Figure 1D), consistent with the reciprocity of expression of these Hox protein pairs observed in vivo (Dasen et al., 2005Dasen J.S. Tice B.C. Brenner-Morton S. Jessell T.M. A Hox regulatory network establishes motor neuron pool identity and target-muscle connectivity.Cell. 2005; 123: 477-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Moreover, the pattern of Hox gene expression achieved under RA/Hh and CV differentiation conditions was dramatically different: with RA/Hh exposure, 89% ± 2% of GFP+ motor neurons expressed Hoxa5 and virtually none expressed Hoxc8 or Hoxc9 (Figures 1B and 1C). Thus, ESCs differentiated under CV, but not RA/Hh, conditions give rise to motor neurons of caudal brachial (Hoxc8+) and thoracic (Hoxc9+) positional character. We next addressed whether CV differentiation conditions promote the generation of motor neurons through a program that resembles that operating in vivo. Because Wnt signals underlie the initial specification of spinal cord identity in vivo (Nordström et al., 2006Nordström U. Maier E. Jessell T.M. Edlund T. An early role for WNT signaling in specifying neural patterns of Cdx and Hox gene expression and motor neuron subtype identity.PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e252Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we examined the fate of CV-differentiated ESCs exposed to the Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1). In the presence of Dkk1, ESCs grown under CV conditions exhibited forebrain/midbrain rather than spinal positional character, revealed by the absence of Hox5 to Hox8 protein expression, the lack of Hb9::GFP+ neurons, and the prevalence of Otx2+ cells (Figure S1D). Within the context of spinal positional character, FGF signaling plays a role in assigning caudal positional identity (Liu et al., 2001Liu J.P. Laufer E. Jessell T.M. Assigning the positional identity of spinal motor neurons: Rostrocaudal patterning of Hox-c expression by FGFs, Gdf11, and retinoids.Neuron. 2001; 32: 997-1012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the Hox profile of CV-differentiated ESCs grown in the presence of a pan-FGF receptor antagonist (PD173074; Mohammadi et al., 1998Mohammadi M. Froum S. Hamby J.M. Schroeder M.C. Panek R.L. Lu G.H. Eliseenkova A.V. Green D. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Crystal structure of an angiogenesis inhibitor bound to the FGF receptor tyrosine kinase domain.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5896-5904Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The resulting ESC-derived motor neurons exhibited a rostralized positional character—expressing Hoxa5 rather than Hoxc8 and Hoxd9 (Figure S1E). Thus, low-density retinoid-free conditions are conducive to embryoid body expression of endogenous Wnt and FGF factors that conspire to caudalize induced neural cells. We next tested whether motor neuron differentiation under CV conditions reflects an endogenous supply of ventralizing factors (Jessell, 2000Jessell T.M. Neuronal specification in the spinal cord: Inductive signals and transcriptional codes.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2000; 1: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar). Clusters of Shh+, FoxA2+, Brachyury+ notochord as well as Shh+, FoxA2+, Brachyuryoff floor plate cells were detected in embryoid bodies grown under CV conditions (Figures S1J–S1L). This endogenous source of hedgehog protein is functional, because exposure of ESCs to a potent Hh receptor antagonist (C61414; Williams et al., 2003Williams J.A. Guicherit O.M. Zaharian B.I. Xu Y. Chai L. Wichterle H. Kon C. Gatchalian C. Porter J.A. Rubin L.L. Wang F.Y. Identification of a small molecule inhibitor of the hedgehog signaling pathway: Effects on basal cell carcinoma-like lesions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 4616-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) blocked the differentiation of ventral spinal progenitor cells and of motor neurons (Figures S1H and S1I). Thus ESCs grown under CV conditions are neuralized, caudalized, and ventralized solely through the actions of endogenous patterning signals, generating motor neurons of a caudal positional character. We note that our induction protocol differs markedly in outcome from prior FGF and Hh-free protocols that result in the generation of rostralized neural cells (Gaspard et al., 2008Gaspard N. Bouschet T. Hourez R. Dimidschstein J. Naeije G. van den Ameele J. Espuny-Camacho I. Herpoel A. Passante L.

Neurosci. 2005; 8: 288-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Do CV-generated ESC-derived motor neurons acquire definitive columnar and pool characters that conform to their Hox profiles? To assess the columnar character of Hb9:GFP+ motor neurons, we monitored expression of Lhx3 and FoxP1, markers of MMC and LMC identity (Dasen et al., 2005Dasen J.S. Tice B.C. Brenner-Morton S. Jessell T.M. A Hox regulatory network establishes motor neuron pool identity and target-muscle connectivity.Cell. 2005; 123: 477-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). We inferred HMC identity by the absence of Lhx3 and FoxP1 (Dasen et al., 2008Dasen J.S. De Camilli A. Wang B. Tucker P.W. Jessell T.M. Hox repertoires for motor neuron diversity and connectivity gated by a single accessory factor, FoxP1.Cell. 2008; 134: 304-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). We found that 38% ± 2% of CV-differentiated motor neurons expressed FoxP1 in the absence of Lhx3, conversely 28% ± 2% expressed Lhx3 in the absence of FoxP1, and 34% ± 1% lacked both FoxP1 and Lhx3 (Figure S2). As in vivo (Dasen et al., 2008Dasen J.S. De Camilli A. Wang B. Tucker P.W. Jessell T.M. Hox repertoires for motor neuron diversity and connectivity gated by a single accessory factor, FoxP1.Cell. 2008; 134: 304-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), >4-fold more Hoxc6+ motor neurons exhibited LMC than MMC character, and >4-fold more Hoxc9+ motor neurons exhibited HMC than MMC character (Figures 2C and 2D ). In addition, we found that 19% ± 6% of motor neurons coexpressed Hoxc9+ and FoxP1, a molecular profile predictive of preganglionic motor column (PGC) neurons (Figures 2C and 2D; Dasen et al., 2008Dasen J.S. De Camilli A. Wang B. Tucker P.W. Jessell T.M. Hox repertoires for motor neuron diversity and connectivity gated by a single accessory factor, FoxP1.Cell. 2008; 134: 304-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The tight correlation between columnar identity and Hox status provides further evidence that CV differentiation conditions favor the formation of motor neurons of coherent caudal brachial or rostral thoracic character. Soon after their generation, LMC motor neurons acquire specialized divisional and pool identities. Lateral divisional identity is imposed on late-born LMC neurons as they migrate through earlier-born medial LMC neurons that serve as a neuronal source of retinoid inductive signals (Sockanathan and Jessell, 1998Sockanathan S. Jessell T.M. Motor neuron-derived retinoid signaling specifies the subtype identity of spinal motor neurons.Cell. 1998; 94: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In parallel, the segment by segment diversification of LMC neurons into specific pool subtypes has been attributed to the probabilistic outcome of cross-repressive interactions between members of a Hox transcriptional network (Dasen et al., 2005Dasen J.S. Tice B.C. Brenner-Morton S. Jessell T.M. A Hox regulatory network establishes motor neuron pool identity and target-muscle connectivity.Cell. 2005; 123: 477-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The scattered arrangement of LMC neurons within CV-differentiated embryoid bodies provided us with an opportunity, not available in vivo, to test the requirement for close proximity between LMC neurons in the emergence of LMC divisional and pool character. We first examined the emergence of lateral LMC divisional character. Very few CV differentiated motor neurons acquired lateral LMC divisional character, as assessed by expression of Lhx1 in GFP+ motor neurons (Figure 3A ). However, exposure of embryoid bodies to RA (1 μM) on day 5 of differentiation elicited a 3-fold increase in the number of Lhx1+, GFP+ motor neurons (p = 0.04 versus control RA-free conditions; Figures 3A and 3B). This retinoid-mediated induction of Lhx1 occurred in postmitotic motor neurons, because BrdU addition at the time of retinoid exposure labeled few if any Lhx1+ motor neurons (Figures 3C–3E). We also verified that retinoid treatment did not alter rostrocaudal positional identity of motor neurons, assessed by the profile of Hox expression (Figures S3A and S3B). Thus, under CV differentiation conditions, the progression of LMC neurons to a lateral LMC fate cannot be driven by signals emanating from neighboring LMC neurons, and requires supplemental retinoid exposure. We next examined whether the emergence of motor pool character in an individual LMC neuron can be achieved in the absence of signals provided by neighboring LMC neurons. To address this issue, we focused on three pools generated within caudal brachial LMC: Scip+, Isl1+ motor neurons that innervate the flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) muscle; Pea3+, Lhx1+ motor neurons that innervate latissimus dorsi (LD) muscle; and Pea3+, Isl1+ motor neurons that innervate the cutaneus maximus (CM) muscle (Figures 4A–4C ). Pea3 expression is induced in CM and LD motor neurons as a consequence of Hox profiles that confer neuronal competence to a permissive limb-derived signal, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) (Dasen et al., 2005Dasen J.S. Tice B.C. Brenner-Morton S. Jessell T.M. A Hox regulatory network establishes motor neuron pool identity and target-muscle connectivity.Cell. 2005; 123: 477-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, Haase et al., 2002Haase G. Dessaud E. Garcès A. de Bovis B. Birling M. Filippi P. Schmalbruch H. Arber S. deLapeyrière O. GDNF acts through PEA3 to regulate cell body positioning and muscle innervation of specific motor neuron pools.Neuron. 2002; 35: 893-905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To reflect this permissive target-derived influence, we supplemented basal CV differentiation medium with GDNF (10 ng/ml; from day 5 onward) and analyzed the transcriptional status of the resulting GFP+ ESC-derived motor neurons. We found that 9% ± 1% of FoxP1+ ESC-derived LMC neurons coexpressed Scip with Hoxc8 and Isl1 (FCU-like; Figures 4D, 4E, and 4G). 17% ± 2% of FoxP1+ ESC-derived motor neurons coexpressed Pea3 with Hoxc8 in the absence of Scip (CM-like; Figures 4D–4G). Of these Pea3+ LMC neurons, 87% ± 6% coexpressed Isl1, and 8% ± 5% expressed Lhx1 (Figures 4F and 4H), indicating that most Pea3+ ESC-derived motor neurons acquired CM rather than LD character. Moreover, as in vivo, FoxP1+ neuronal coexpression of Pea3 but not Scip was dependent on GDNF (0.0% ± 0.0% of FoxP1+ ESC-derived motor neurons express Pea3 in the absence and 17% ± 2% in the presence of GDNF, p < 0.001; while 9% ± 1% express Scip in the absence and 8% ± 2% in the presence of GDNF, p = 0.70) (Figures 4D, 4E, and 4G). These results show that LMC neurons generated under CV conditions can acquire motor pool identities consistent with those generated in vivo. To test the ability of individual ESC-derived LMC neurons to acquire authentic pool character in the absence of signals from their LMC neighbors, we devised a method of generating a few isolated LMC neurons within a vast majority of neighboring cervical non-LMC cells. To achieve this condition, we dissociated Hb9-GFP motor neuron progenitors generated under CV conditions on day 4 of differentiation and mixed them with a 5-fold excess of wild-type motor neuron progenitors generated under RA/Hh conditions and lacking GFP expression (Figures 5A–5C ). Because under CV conditions, ∼8% of cells differentiate into motor neurons, and under RA/Hh conditions ∼40% become motor neurons, the resulting ratio of CV:RA/Hh-derived motor neurons in reaggregates is predicted to be ∼1:25. In practice, we found that 2.6% ± 0.7% of all Hb9+ ESC-derived motor neurons generated under this reaggregate condition expressed GFP (a 1:38 ratio) (Figure 5C, data not shown). And because motor neurons are surrounded by a majority of other cell types, the chances that any two LMC neurons occupy the same microdomain of the embryoid body are exceedingly low. We therefore examined the pool subtype identities of individual CV GFP+ Hoxc8+ ESC-derived motor neurons 3 days after reaggregation. We found that Scip and Pea3 were expressed in a mutually exclusive manner by GFP+, FoxP1+ LMC neurons, and the proportional representation of these two pool subtypes was similar to that found in CV-differentiated conditions (Figures 5H–5N and 5Q). These findings indicate that in contrast to the rules of LMC divisional specification, authentic molecular motor pool identities can emerge in the absence of any influence from other LMC neurons. We next turned to the issue of whether CV-generated LMC neurons exhibit functional attributes of their in vivo generated counterparts. Adhering to the principle of “in vivo veritas,” we examined the behavior of CV generated LMC neurons after isochronic grafting into embryonic chick spinal cord, focusing on the intraspinal settling position and peripheral axonal trajectories of grafted neurons (Wichterle et al., 2002Wichterle H.

DNA condensation is crucial in ensuring that chromosomes are correctly attached to the mitotic spindle for segregation, preventing DNA breaks or constrictions from the contractile ring. Histones form an octameric complex of basic proteins important in regulating DNA organization and accessibility. Histone post-translational modifications are altered during mitosis, although the roles of these post-translational modifications remain poorly characterized. Here, we report that N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT), the enzyme catalyzing the addition of O-GlcNAc moieties to nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins at serine and threonine residues, regulates some aspects of mitotic chromatin dynamics. OGT protein amounts decrease during M phase. Modest overexpression of OGT alters mitotic histone post-translational modifications at Lys-9, Ser-10, Arg-17, and Lys-27 of histone H3. Overexpression of OGT also prevents mitotic phosphorylation of coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) and prevents its correct cellular localization during mitosis. Moreover, OGT overexpression results in an increase in abnormal chromosomal bridge formation. Together, these results show that regulating the amount of OGT during mitosis is important in ensuring correct chromosomal segregation during mitosis."

In this study, we report the X-ray crystal structure of PAUF and reveal that PAUF is a mammalian lectin normally found in plant lectins. We also identify PAUF as an endogenous ligand of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4 by screening extracellular domain receptor pools. We further confirmed the specificity of the PAUF-TLR2 interaction. PAUF induces extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and activates the IKK-β-mediated TPL2/MEK/ERK signaling pathway through TLR2. In agreement with the result of TLR2-mediated ERK activation by PAUF, PAUF induces increased expression of the protumorigenic cytokines RANTES and MIF in THP-1 cells. However, PAUF does not fully activate Iκ-B-α signaling pathways in THP-1 cells, and fails to translocate the p65 subunit of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) complex into the nucleus, resulting in no NF-κB activation. Surprisingly, we found that PAUF also associated with the CXC chemokine receptor (CXCR4)-TLR2 complex and inhibited CXCR4-dependent, TLR2-mediated NF-κB activation. Together, these findings suggest that the new cancer-associated ligand, PAUF, may activate TLR-mediated ERK signaling to produce the protumorigenic cytokines, but inhibits TLR-mediated NF-κB signaling, thereby facilitating tumor growth and escape from innate immune surveillance."

The function of TBX5 in cancer development is largely unclear. We identified that TBX5 was preferentially methylated in cancer using methylation-sensitive arbitrarily primed PCR. We aim to clarify the epigenetic inactivation, biological function and clinical significance of TBX5 in colon cancer. Promoter methylation was evaluated by combined bisulfite restriction analysis and bisulfite genomic sequencing. Cell proliferation was examined by cell viability assay and colony formation assay, apoptosis by flow cytometry and cell migration by wound-healing assay. TBX5 target genes were identified by cDNA microarray analysis. Cox regression model and log-rank test were used to identify independent predictors of prognosis. TBX5 was silenced or downregulated in 88% (7/8) colon cancer cell lines, but was expressed in normal colon tissues. Loss of gene expression was associated with promoter methylation. The biological function of TBX5 in human colon cancer cells was examined. Re-expression of TBX5 in silenced colon cancer cell lines suppressed colony formation (P<0.001), proliferation (P<0.001), migration and induced apoptosis (P<0.01). Induction of apoptosis was mediated through cross-talk of extrinsic apoptosis pathway, apoptotic BCL2-associated X protein and Granzyme A signaling cascades. TBX5 suppressed tumor cell proliferation and metastasis through the upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A, metastasis suppressor 1 and downregulation of synuclein gamma and metastasis-associated protein 1 family member 2. TBX5 methylation was detected in 68% (71/105) of primary colon tumors. Multivariate analysis showed that patients with TBX5 methylation had a significantly poor overall survival (P=0.0007). In conclusion, we identified a novel functional tumor suppressor gene TBX5 inactivated by promoter methylation in colon cancer. Detection of methylated TBX5 may serve as a potential biomarker for the prognosis of this malignancy."

In this article, we show that the BH3-only protein Noxa is strongly transcriptionally upregulated in response to cisplatin and related platinum compounds. Cisplatin-induced Noxa expression was ERK dependent, but p53 independent, and inhibition of ERK activation markedly attenuated cisplatin-induced cell death, as well as Noxa expression. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated ablation of Noxa expression also inhibited cisplatin-induced cell death and permitted clonogenic survival. These observations reveal a novel ERK-regulated route to Noxa expression that is important for the cell killing activity of platinum-based chemotherapeutic drugs."

Intriguingly, unsaturated FFAs such as palmitoleate (C16:1) and oleate (C18:1) had no such detrimental effects, appearing instead to effectively reverse palmitate-induced impairment of insulin-responsive GLUT4 recycling along with restoration of sortilin abundance by preventing aberrant PKCθ activation.

https://openalex.org/W2070799929,"Stem cell division can result in two sibling cells exhibiting differential mitogenic and self-renewing potential. Here, we present evidence that the dual-specificity kinase Dyrk1A is part of a molecular pathway involved in the regulation of biased epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling in the progeny of dividing neural stem cells (NSC) of the adult subependymal zone (SEZ). We show that EGFR asymmetry requires regulated sorting and that a normal Dyrk1a dosage is required to sustain EGFR in the two daughters of a symmetrically dividing progenitor. Dyrk1A is symmetrically or asymmetrically distributed during mitosis, and biochemical analyses indicate that it prevents endocytosis-mediated degradation of EGFR by a mechanism that requires phosphorylation of the EGFR signaling modulator Sprouty2. Finally, Dyrk1a heterozygous NSCs exhibit defects in self-renewal, EGF-dependent cell-fate decisions, and long-term persistence in vivo, suggesting that symmetrical divisions play a role in the maintenance of the SEZ reservoir."

Plk2 disrupts the interaction between NSF and the GluA2 AMPAR subunit in a kinase-independent manner, promoting GluA2 internalization and decreased synaptic AMPAR current. Trafficking of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) is important for many forms of synaptic plasticity. However, the link between activity and resulting synaptic alterations is not fully understood. We identified a direct interaction between N-ethylmaleimide–sensitive fusion protein (NSF), an ATPase involved in membrane fusion events and stabilization of surface AMPARs, and Polo-like kinase- 2 (Plk2), an activity-inducible kinase that homeostatically decreases excitatory synapse number and strength. Plk2 disrupted the interaction of NSF with the GluA2 subunit of AMPARs, promoting extensive loss of surface GluA2 in rat hippocampal neurons, greater association of GluA2 with adaptor proteins PICK1 and GRIP1, and decreased synaptic AMPAR current. Plk2 engagement of NSF, but not Plk2 kinase activity, was required for this mechanism and occurred through a motif in the Plk2 protein that was independent of the canonical polo box interaction sites. These data reveal that heightened synaptic activity, acting through Plk2, leads to homeostatic decreases in surface AMPAR expression via the direct dissociation of NSF from GluA2."
https://openalex.org/W2023979874,"Jun activation domain-binding protein 1 (JAB1) is a multifunctional protein that participates in the control of cell proliferation and the stability of multiple proteins. JAB1 overexpression has been implicated in the pathogenesis of human cancer. JAB1 regulates several key proteins and thereby produces varied effects on cell cycle progression, genome stability and cell survival. However, the biological significance of JAB1 activity in these cellular signaling pathways is unclear. Therefore, we developed mice that were deficient in Jab1 and analyzed the null embryos and heterozygous cells. This disruption of Jab1 in mice resulted in early embryonic lethality due to accelerated apoptosis. Loss of Jab1 expression sensitized both mouse primary embryonic fibroblasts and osteosarcoma cells to γ-radiation-induced apoptosis, with an increase in spontaneous DNA damage and homologous recombination (HR) defects, both of which correlated with reduced levels of the DNA repair protein Rad51 and elevated levels of p53. Furthermore, the accumulated p53 directly binds to Rad51 promoter, inhibits its activity and represents a major mechanism underlying the HR repair defect in Jab1-deficient cells. These results indicate that Jab1 is essential for efficient DNA repair and mechanistically link Jab1 to the maintenance of genome integrity and to cell survival."
https://openalex.org/W1981341553,"VPS4 proteins are AAA+ ATPases required to form multivesicular bodies, release viral particles, and complete cytokinesis. They act by disassembling ESCRT-III heteropolymers during or after their proposed function in membrane scission. Here we show that purified human VPS4A is essentially inactive but can be stimulated to hydrolyze ATP by ESCRT-III proteins in a reaction that requires both their previously defined MIT interacting motifs and ∼50 amino acids of the adjacent sequence. Importantly, C-terminal fragments of all ESCRT-III proteins tested, including CHMP2A, CHMP1B, CHMP3, CHMP4A, CHMP6, and CHMP5, activated VPS4A suggesting that it disassembles ESCRT-III heteropolymers by affecting each component protein. VPS4A is thought to act as a ring-shaped cylindrical oligomer like other AAA+ ATPases, but this has been difficult to directly demonstrate. We found that concentrating His6-VPS4A on liposomes containing Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-tagged lipid increased ATP hydrolysis, confirming the importance of inter-subunit interactions for activity. We also found that mutating pore loops expected to line the center of a cylindrical oligomer changed the response of VPS4A to ESCRT-III proteins. Based on these data, we propose that ESCRT-III proteins facilitate assembly of functional but transient VPS4A oligomers and interact with sequences inside the pore of the assembled enzyme. Deleting the N-terminal MIT domain and adjacent linker from VPS4A increased both basal and liposome-enhanced ATPase activity, indicating that these elements play a role in autoinhibiting VPS4A until it encounters ESCRT-III proteins. These findings reveal new ways in which VPS4 activity is regulated and specifically directed to ESCRT-III polymers. VPS4 proteins are AAA+ ATPases required to form multivesicular bodies, release viral particles, and complete cytokinesis. They act by disassembling ESCRT-III heteropolymers during or after their proposed function in membrane scission. Here we show that purified human VPS4A is essentially inactive but can be stimulated to hydrolyze ATP by ESCRT-III proteins in a reaction that requires both their previously defined MIT interacting motifs and ∼50 amino acids of the adjacent sequence. Importantly, C-terminal fragments of all ESCRT-III proteins tested, including CHMP2A, CHMP1B, CHMP3, CHMP4A, CHMP6, and CHMP5, activated VPS4A suggesting that it disassembles ESCRT-III heteropolymers by affecting each component protein. VPS4A is thought to act as a ring-shaped cylindrical oligomer like other AAA+ ATPases, but this has been difficult to directly demonstrate. We found that concentrating His6-VPS4A on liposomes containing Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-tagged lipid increased ATP hydrolysis, confirming the importance of inter-subunit interactions for activity.

https://openalex.org/W2009165868,"The co-evolution of tumors and their microenvironment involves bidirectional communication between tumor cells and tumor-associated stroma. Various cell types are present in tumor-associated stroma, of which fibroblasts are the most abundant. The Rac exchange factor Tiam1 is implicated in multiple signaling pathways in epithelial tumor cells and lack of Tiam1 in tumor cells retards tumor growth in Tiam1 knockout mouse models. Conversely, tumors arising in Tiam1 knockout mice have increased invasiveness. We have investigated the role of Tiam1 in tumor-associated fibroblasts as a modulator of tumor cell invasion and metastasis, using retroviral delivery of short hairpin RNA to suppress Tiam1 levels in three different experimental models. In spheroid co-culture of mammary epithelial cells and fibroblasts, Tiam1 silencing in fibroblasts led to increased epithelial cell outgrowth into matrix. In tissue-engineered human skin, Tiam1 silencing in dermal fibroblasts led to increased invasiveness of epidermal keratinocytes with pre-malignant features. In a model of human breast cancer in mice, co-implantation of mammary fibroblasts inhibited tumor invasion and metastasis, which was reversed by Tiam1 silencing in co-injected fibroblasts. These results suggest that stromal Tiam1 may have a role in modulating the effects of the tumor microenvironment on malignant cell invasion and metastasis. This suggests a set of pathways for further investigation, with implications for future therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2052816585,"The majority of mortality associated with cancer is due to formation of metastases from the primary tumor. Adhesion mediated by different integrin heterodimers has an important role during cell migration and invasion. Protein interactions with the β1-integrin cytoplasmic tail are known to influence integrin affinity for extracellular ligands, but regulating binding partners for the α-subunit cytoplasmic tails have remained elusive. In this study, we show that mammary-derived growth inhibitor (MDGI) (also known as FABP-3 or H-FABP) binds directly to the cytoplasmic tail of integrin α-subunits and its expression inhibits integrin activity. In breast cancer cell lines, MDGI expression correlates with suppression of the active conformation of integrins. This results in reduced integrin adhesion to type I collagen and fibronectin and inhibition of cell migration and invasion. In tissue microarray of 1331 breast cancer patients, patients with MDGI-positive tumors had more favorable 10-year distant disease-free survival compared with patients with MDGI-negative tumors. Our data indicate that MDGI is a novel interacting partner for integrin α-subunits, and its expression modulates integrin activity and suppresses cell invasion in breast cancer patients. Retained MDGI expression is associated with favorable prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2035268716,"Although Wnt-Frizzled (Fzd) signaling is critical in the pathophysiology of carcinomas, its role in human breast cancer has been difficult to establish. We show here that the adaptor protein Na(+)/H(+) exchange regulatory factor1 (NHERF1), a protein abundantly expressed in normal mammary epithelium, regulates Wnt signaling, maintaining low levels of β-catenin activation. NHERF1's effects are mediated by direct interactions between one of its PSD-95/drosophila discs large/ZO-1 (PDZ) domains and the C-terminus of a subset of Fzd receptors. Loss of NHERF1 in breast cancer cell lines enhances canonical Wnt signaling and Wnt-dependent cell proliferation. Furthermore, the mammary glands of NHERF1-knockout mice exhibit increased mammary duct density accompanied by increased proliferation and β-catenin activity. Finally, we demonstrate a negative correlation between NHERF1 expression and nuclear β-catenin in human breast carcinomas. Taken together, these results provide a novel insight into the regulation of Wnt signaling in normal and neoplastic breast tissues, and identify NHERF1 as an important regulator of the pathogenesis of breast tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2022501871,"Angiogenesis inhibitors have shown clinical benefits in patients with advanced cancer, but further therapeutic improvement is needed. We have previously shown that the zinc finger protein 36, C3H type-like 1 (ZFP36L1) enhances vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA decay through its interaction with AU-rich elements within VEGF 3′-untranslated region. In this study, we evaluated the possibility to develop an antiangiogenic and antitumoral strategy using the mRNA-destabilizing activity of ZFP36L1. We engineered a cell-penetrating ZFP36L1, by fusing it to the protein transduction domains (PTDs) TAT derived from HIV, or the polyarginine peptides R7 or R9. PTD-ZFP36L1 fusion proteins were expressed in bacterial cells and affinity-purified to homogeneity. TAT-, R7- and R9-ZFP36L1 were efficiently internalized into living cells and decreased both endogenous VEGF mRNA half-life and VEGF protein levels in vitro. Importantly, a single injection of R9-TIS11b fusion protein into a high-VEGF expressing tissue in vivo (in this study, the mouse adrenal gland) markedly decreased VEGF expression. We further evaluated the effect of R9-ZFP36L1 on tumor growth using Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LL/2) cells implanted subcutaneously into nude mice. Intratumoral injection of R9-ZFP36L1 significantly reduced tumor growth and markedly decreased the expression of multiple angiogenic and inflammatory cytokines, including VEGF, acidic fibroblast growth factor, tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin (IL)-1α and IL-6, with a concomitant obliteration of tumor vascularization. These findings indicate that R9-ZFP36L1 fusion protein may represent a novel antiangiogenic and antitumoral agent, and supports the emerging idea that modulation of mRNA stability represents a promising therapeutic approach to treat cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2047622372,"Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most aggressive subtype of lung cancer in its clinical behavior, with a 5-year overall survival as low as 5%. Despite years of research in the field, molecular determinants of SCLC behavior are still poorly understood, and this deficiency has translated into an absence of specific diagnostics and targeted therapeutics. We hypothesized that tumor DNA copy number alterations would allow the identification of molecular pathways involved in SCLC progression. Array comparative genomic hybridization was performed on DNA extracted from 46 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded SCLC tissue specimens. Genomic profiling of tumor and sex-matched control DNA allowed the identification of 70 regions of copy number gain and 55 regions of copy number loss. Using molecular pathway analysis, we found a strong enrichment in these regions of copy number alterations for 11 genes associated with the focal adhesion pathway. We verified these findings at the genomic, gene expression and protein level. Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK), one of the central genes represented in this pathway, was commonly expressed in SCLC tumors and constitutively phosphorylated in SCLC cell lines. Those were poorly adherent to most substrates but not to laminin-322. Inhibition of FAK phosphorylation at Tyr(397) by a small-molecule inhibitor, PF-573,228, induced a dose-dependent decrease of adhesion and an increase of spreading in SCLC cell lines on laminin-322. Cells that tended to spread also showed a decrease in focal adhesions, as demonstrated by a decreased vinculin expression. These results support the concept that pathway analysis of genes in regions of copy number alterations may uncover molecular mechanisms of disease progression and demonstrate a new role of FAK and associated adhesion pathways in SCLC. Further investigations of FAK at the functional level may lead to a better understanding of SCLC progression and may have therapeutic implications."
https://openalex.org/W2009917537,"The mitochondrial adenine nucleotide carrier (Ancp) catalyzes the transport of ADP and ATP across the mitochondrial inner membrane, thus playing an essential role in cellular energy metabolism. During the transport mechanism the carrier switches between two different conformations that can be blocked by two toxins: carboxyatractyloside (CATR) and bongkrekic acid. Therefore, our understanding of the nucleotide transport mechanism can be improved by analyzing structural differences of the individual inhibited states. We have solved the three-dimensional structure of bovine carrier isoform 1 (bAnc1p) in a complex with CATR, but the structure of the carrier-bongkrekic acid complex, and thus, the detailed mechanism of transport remains unknown. Improvements in sample processing in the hydrogen/deuterium exchange technique coupled to mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) have allowed us to gain novel insights into the conformational changes undergone by bAnc1p. This paper describes the first study of bAnc1p using HDX-MS. Results obtained with the CATR-bAnc1p complex were fully in agreement with published results, thus, validating our approach. On the other hand, the HDX kinetics of the two complexes displays marked differences. The bongkrekic acid-bAnc1p complex exhibits greater accessibility to the solvent on the matrix side, whereas the CATR-bAnc1p complex is more accessible on the intermembrane side. These results are discussed with respect to the structural and biochemical data available on Ancp."
https://openalex.org/W2030693010,"Nucleophosmin (NPM/B23) is a multifunctional oncoprotein whose protein expression levels dictate cellular growth and proliferation rates. NPM is translationally responsive to hyperactive mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signals, but the mechanism of this regulation is not understood. Using chimeric translational reporters, we found that the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the NPM messenger (m)RNA is sufficient to mediate its translational modulation by mTOR signalling. We show that far upstream element (FUSE)-binding protein 1 (FBP1) interacts specifically with the 3' UTR of NPM to repress translation. Overexpression of FBP1 resulted in translational repression of NPM mRNAs, whereas depletion of FBP1 caused a dramatic increase in NPM translation and resulted in enhanced overall cell proliferation. Thus, we propose that FBP1 is a key regulator of cell growth and proliferation through its ability to selectively bind the NPM 3' UTR and repress NPM translation."
https://openalex.org/W2039885364,"We report here a novel role for Jun dimerization protein-2 (JDP2) as a regulator of the progression of normal cells through the cell cycle. To determine the role of JDP2 in vivo, we generated Jdp2-knockout (Jdp2KO) mice by targeting exon-1 to disrupt the site of initiation of transcription. The epidermal thickening of skin from the Jdp2KO mice after treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) proceeded more rapidly than that of control mice, and more proliferating cells were found at the epidermis. Fibroblasts derived from embryos of Jdp2KO mice proliferated faster and formed more colonies than fibroblasts from wild-type mice. JDP2 was recruited to the promoter of the gene for cyclin-A2 (ccna2) at the AP-1 site. Cells lacking Jdp2 had elevated levels of cyclin-A2 mRNA. Furthermore, reintroduction of JDP2 resulted in the repression of transcription of ccna2 and of cell-cycle progression. Thus, transcription of the gene for cyclin-A2 appears to be a direct target of JDP2 in the suppression of cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1996494247,"The development of acquired resistance to trastuzumab remains a prevalent challenge in the treatment of patients whose tumors express human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2). We previously reported that HER2 overexpressing breast cancers are dependent on Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) for growth and survival. As YB-1 is also linked to drug resistance in other types of cancer, we address its possible role in trastuzumab insensitivity. Employing an in vivo model of acquired resistance, we demonstrate that resistant cell lines have elevated levels of P-YB-1S102 and its activating kinase P-RSK and these levels are sustained following trastuzumab treatment. Further, to demonstrate the importance of YB-1 in mediating drug resistance, the expression of the active mutant YB-1S102D rendered the BT474 cell line insensitive to trastuzumab. Questioning the role of tumor-initiating cells (TIC) and their ability to escape cancer therapies, we investigate YB-1's role in inducing the cancer stem cell marker CD44. Notably, the resistant cells express more CD44 mRNA and protein compared with BT474 cells, which correlated with increased mammosphere formation. Expression of YB-1S102D in the BT474 cells increase CD44 protein levels, resulting in enhanced mammosphere formation. Further, exposing BT474 cells to trastuzumab selected for a resistant sub-population enriched for CD44. Conversely, small intefering RNA inhibition of CD44 restored trastuzumab sensitivity in the resistant cell lines. Our findings provide insight on a novel mechanism employed by tumor cells to acquire the ability to escape the effects of trastuzumab and suggest that targeting YB-1 may overcome resistance by eliminating the unresponsive TIC population, rendering the cancer sensitive to therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2082273024,"Malignant glioma represents one of the most aggressive and lethal human neoplasias. A hallmark of gliomas is their rapid proliferation and destruction of vital brain tissue, a process in which excessive glutamate release by glioma cells takes center stage. Pharmacologic antagonism with glutamate signaling through ionotropic glutamate receptors attenuates glioma progression in vivo, indicating that glutamate release by glioma cells is a prerequisite for rapid glioma growth. Glutamate has been suggested to promote glioma cell proliferation in an autocrine or paracrine manner, in particular by activation of the (RS)-α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid hydrate (AMPA) subtype of glutamate receptors. Here, we dissect the effects of glutamate secretion on glioma progression. Glioma cells release glutamate through the amino-acid antiporter system X(c)(-), a process that is mechanistically linked with cystine incorporation. We show that disrupting glutamate secretion by interfering with the system X(c)(-) activity attenuates glioma cell proliferation solely cystine dependently, whereas glutamate itself does not augment glioma cell growth in vitro. Neither AMPA receptor agonism nor antagonism affects glioma growth in vitro. On a molecular level, AMPA insensitivity is concordant with a pronounced transcriptional downregulation of AMPA receptor subunits or overexpression of the fully edited GluR2 subunit, both of which block receptor activity. Strikingly, AMPA receptor inhibition in tumor-implanted brain slices resulted in markedly reduced tumor progression associated with alleviated neuronal cell death, suggesting that the ability of glutamate to promote glioma progression strictly requires the tumor microenvironment. Concerning a potential pharmacotherapy, targeting system X(c)(-) activity disrupts two major pathophysiological properties of glioma cells, that is, the induction of excitotoxic neuronal cell death and incorporation of cystine required for rapid proliferation."

Although the involvement of pVHL in oxygen sensing through targeting hypoxia-inducible factor-α subunits to ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis has been well documented, less is known about pVHL regulation under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. We found that pVHL levels decreased in hypoxia and that hypoxia-induced cell cycle arrest is associated with pVHL expression in RCC cells. pVHL levels fluctuate during the cell cycle, paralleling cyclin B1 levels, with decreased levels in mitosis and G1. pVHL contains consensus destruction (D) box sequences, and pVHL associates with Cdh1, an activator of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) E3 ubiquitin ligase. We show that pVHL has a decreased half-life in G1, Cdh1 downregulation results in increased pVHL expression, whereas Cdh1 overexpression results in decreased pVHL expression. Taken together, these results suggest that pVHL is a novel substrate of APC/CCdh1. D box-independent pVHL degradation was also detected, indicating that other ubiquitin ligases are also activated for pVHL degradation."

https://openalex.org/W2331369555,"Integrin/cytokine receptor interaction provides permissive signals leading to neoangiogenesis, and integrins are crucial for differentiation of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). It is known that the inflammatory interleukin-3 (IL-3), released in the tumoral microenvironment, contributes to both angiogenesis and vasculogenic processes. Herein, we generated IL-3 receptor beta common (IL-3Rβc) extracellular domain-derived fusion proteins (Fc) to elucidate the molecular mechanisms regulating these processes. Three different Fc were generated, containing the entire extracellular domain of IL-3Rβc (Fc1.4), a fragment corresponding to domains 1–3 (Fc1.3) and a fragment corresponding to domain 4 (Fc4), respectively. The ability of the fusion proteins to interfere with IL-3Rβc/β1 integrin interaction was assessed on endothelial cells (ECs), EPCs and murine-derived ECs. Pull-down experiments showed that Fc1.4 and Fc4 fusion proteins specifically interacted with β1 integrin. Fc4 and Fc1.4 fragments prevented IL-3-mediated EPC expansion, arterial morphogenesis and tumour-derived EC migration, without affecting cell adhesion. Fc4 in vivo inhibited the IL-3-mediated vasculogenic process, as well as inflammatory and tumour vascular growth. In conclusion, these data identify the β1 integrin-interacting domain in the juxta-membrane IL-3Rβc extracellular domain, and provide the rational for targeting this interaction to impair vascular growth."
https://openalex.org/W1990050246,"Polysialic acid is a developmentally regulated, anti-adhesive polymer that is added to N-glycans on the fifth immunoglobulin domain (Ig5) of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). We found that the first fibronectin type III repeat (FN1) of NCAM is required for the polysialylation of N-glycans on the adjacent Ig5 domain, and we proposed that the polysialyltransferases recognize specific sequences in FN1 to position themselves for Ig5 N-glycan polysialylation. Other studies identified a novel FN1 acidic surface patch and α-helix that play roles in NCAM polysialylation. Here, we characterize the contribution of two additional FN1 sequences, Pro510-Tyr511-Ser512 (PYS) and Gln516-Val517-Gln518 (QVQ). Replacing PYS or the acidic patch dramatically decreases the O-glycan polysialylation of a truncated NCAM protein, and replacing the α-helix or QVQ shifts polysialic acid to FN1 O-glycans in full-length NCAM. We also found that the FN1 domain of the olfactory cell adhesion molecule, a homologous but unpolysialylated protein, could partially replace NCAM FN1. Inserting Pro510-Tyr511 eliminated N-glycan polysialylation and enhanced O-glycosylation of an NCAM- olfactory cell adhesion molecule chimera, and inserting other FN1 sequences unique to NCAM, predominantly the acidic patch, created a new polysialyltransferase recognition site. Taken together, our results highlight the role of the FN1 α-helix and QVQ sequences in N-glycan polysialylation and demonstrate that the acidic patch primarily functions in O-glycan polysialylation."

https://openalex.org/W1995866768,"v-Rel is the acutely oncogenic member of the NF-κB family of transcription factors. Infection with retroviruses expressing v-Rel rapidly induces fatal lymphomas in birds and transforms primary lymphocytes and fibroblasts in vitro. We have previously shown that AP-1 transcriptional activity contributes to v-Rel-mediated transformation. Although v-Rel increases the expression of these factors, their activity may also be induced through phosphorylation by the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). The expression of v-Rel results in the strong and sustained activation of the ERK and JNK MAPK pathways. This induction is critical for the v-Rel-transformed phenotype, as suppression of MAPK activity with chemical inhibitors or small interfering RNA severely impairs colony formation of v-Rel-transformed lymphoid cell lines. However, signaling must be maintained within an optimal range in these cells, as strong additional activation of either pathway beyond the levels induced by v-Rel through the expression of constitutively active MAPK proteins attenuates the transformed phenotype. MAPK signaling also has an important role in the initial transformation of primary spleen cells by v-Rel, although distinct requirements for MAPK activity at different stages of v-Rel-mediated transformation were identified. We also show that the ability of v-Rel to induce MAPK signaling more strongly than c-Rel contributes to its greater oncogenicity."
