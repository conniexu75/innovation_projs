https://openalex.org/W3023519397,"A total of 2,618,862 participants reported their potential symptoms of COVID-19 on a smartphone-based app. Among the 18,401 who had undergone a SARS-CoV-2 test, the proportion of participants who reported loss of smell and taste was higher in those with a positive test result (4,668 of 7,178 individuals; 65.03%) than in those with a negative test result (2,436 of 11,223 participants; 21.71%) (odds ratio = 6.74; 95% confidence interval = 6.31-7.21). A model combining symptoms to predict probable infection was applied to the data from all app users who reported symptoms (805,753) and predicted that 140,312 (17.42%) participants are likely to have COVID-19."

We adapted prime editors for use in plants through codon, promoter, and editing-condition optimization. The resulting suite of plant prime editors enable point mutations, insertions and deletions in rice and wheat protoplasts. Regenerated prime-edited rice plants were obtained at frequencies of up to 21.8%."

Here we hypothesize that a deep neural network can predict an important future clinical event (one-year all-cause mortality) from ECG voltage-time traces. We show good performance for predicting one-year mortality with an average AUC of 0.85 from a model cross-validated on 1,775,926 12-lead resting ECGs, that were collected over a 34-year period in a large regional health system. Even within the large subset of ECGs interpreted as 'normal' by a physician (n=297,548), the model performance to predict one-year mortality remained high (AUC=0.84), and Cox Proportional Hazard model revealed a hazard ratio of 6.6 (p<0.005) for the two predicted groups (dead vs alive one year after ECG) over a 30-year follow-up period. A blinded survey of three cardiologists suggested that the patterns captured by the model were generally not visually apparent to cardiologists even after being shown 240 paired examples of labeled true positives (dead) and true negatives (alive). In summary, deep learning can add significant prognostic information to the interpretation of 12-lead resting ECGs, even in cases that are interpreted as 'normal' by physicians."

Genetic elements such as sex-chromosome drives can distort sex ratios to produce unisex populations that eventually collapse, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. We report a male-biased sex-distorter gene drive (SDGD) in the human malaria vector Anopheles gambiae . We induced super-Mendelian inheritance of the X-chromosome-shredding I-PpoI nuclease by coupling this to a CRISPR-based gene drive inserted into a conserved sequence of the doublesex ( dsx ) gene. In modeling of invasion dynamics, SDGD was predicted to have a quicker impact on female mosquito populations than previously developed gene drives targeting female fertility. The SDGD at the dsx locus led to a male-only population from a 2.5% starting allelic frequency in 10–14 generations, with population collapse and no selection for resistance. Our results support the use of SDGD for malaria vector control."
https://openalex.org/W3021509493,"Epigenetic marks are reprogrammed in the gametes to reset genomic potential in the next generation. In mammals, paternal chromatin is extensively reprogrammed through the global erasure of DNA methylation and the exchange of histones with protamines1,2. Precisely how the paternal epigenome is reprogrammed in flowering plants has remained unclear since DNA is not demethylated and histones are retained in sperm3,4. Here, we describe a multi-layered mechanism by which H3K27me3 is globally lost from histone-based sperm chromatin in Arabidopsis. This mechanism involves the silencing of H3K27me3 writers, activity of H3K27me3 erasers and deposition of a sperm-specific histone, H3.10 (ref. 5), which we show is immune to lysine 27 methylation. The loss of H3K27me3 facilitates the transcription of genes essential for spermatogenesis and pre-configures sperm with a chromatin state that forecasts gene expression in the next generation. Thus, plants have evolved a specific mechanism to simultaneously differentiate male gametes and reprogram the paternal epigenome."
https://openalex.org/W3023726965,"Leukotrienes (LT) are lipid mediators of the inflammatory response that are linked to asthma and atherosclerosis. LT biosynthesis is initiated by 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) with the assistance of the substrate-binding 5-LOX-activating protein at the nuclear membrane. Here, we contrast the structural and functional consequences of the binding of two natural product inhibitors of 5-LOX. The redox-type inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) is lodged in the 5-LOX active site, now fully exposed by disordering of the helix that caps it in the apo-enzyme. In contrast, the allosteric inhibitor 3-acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid (AKBA) from frankincense wedges between the membrane-binding and catalytic domains of 5-LOX, some 30 A from the catalytic iron. While enzyme inhibition by NDGA is robust, AKBA promotes a shift in the regiospecificity, evident in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and in primary immune cells expressing 5-LOX. Our results suggest a new approach to isoform-specific 5-LOX inhibitor development through exploitation of an allosteric site in 5-LOX."
https://openalex.org/W3023033208,"Abstract Recent efforts toward an HIV vaccine focus on inducing broadly neutralizing antibodies, but eliciting both neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) and cellular responses may be superior. Here, we immunized macaques with an HIV envelope trimer, either alone to induce nAbs, or together with a heterologous viral vector regimen to elicit nAbs and cellular immunity, including CD8 + tissue-resident memory T cells. After ten vaginal challenges with autologous virus, protection was observed in both vaccine groups at 53.3% and 66.7%, respectively. A nAb titer &gt;300 was generally associated with protection but in the heterologous viral vector + nAb group, titers &lt;300 were sufficient. In this group, protection was durable as the animals resisted six more challenges 5 months later. Antigen stimulation of T cells in ex vivo vaginal tissue cultures triggered antiviral responses in myeloid and CD4 + T cells. We propose that cellular immune responses reduce the threshold of nAbs required to confer superior and durable protection."
https://openalex.org/W3023510342,"During sleep and awake rest, the neocortex generates large-scale slow-wave (SW) activity. Here, we report that the claustrum coordinates neocortical SW generation. We established a transgenic mouse line that enabled the genetic interrogation of a subpopulation of claustral glutamatergic neurons. These neurons received inputs from and sent outputs to widespread neocortical areas. The claustral neuronal firings mostly correlated with cortical SW activity. In vitro optogenetic stimulation of the claustrum induced excitatory postsynaptic responses in most neocortical neurons, but elicited action potentials primarily in inhibitory interneurons. In vivo optogenetic stimulation induced a synchronized down-state featuring prolonged silencing of neural activity in all layers of many cortical areas, followed by a down-to-up state transition. In contrast, genetic ablation of claustral neurons attenuated SW activity in the frontal cortex. These results demonstrate a crucial role of claustral neurons in synchronizing inhibitory interneurons across wide cortical areas for the spatiotemporal coordination of SW activity. The authors establish the claustrum-Cre transgenic mouse line and demonstrate that the claustrum orchestrates cortical slow-wave activity by synchronously driving the inhibitory interneurons in widespread cortical areas."

https://openalex.org/W3023087420,"Descending command neurons instruct spinal networks to execute basic locomotor functions, such as gait and speed. The command functions for gait and speed are symmetric, implying that a separate unknown system directs asymmetric movements, including the ability to move left or right. In the present study, we report that Chx10-lineage reticulospinal neurons act to control the direction of locomotor movements in mammals. Chx10 neurons exhibit mainly ipsilateral projection, and their selective unilateral activation causes ipsilateral turning movements in freely moving mice. Unilateral inhibition of Chx10 neurons causes contralateral turning movements. Paired left–right motor recordings identified distinct mechanisms for directional movements mediated via limb and axial spinal circuits. Finally, we identify sensorimotor brain regions that project on to Chx10 reticulospinal neurons, and demonstrate that their unilateral activation can impart left–right directional commands. Together these data identify the descending motor system that commands left–right locomotor asymmetries in mammals. Cregg et al. find that a specific population of brainstem neurons act to control left–right turning of locomotor movements in mammals through distinct axial- and limb-based mechanisms. This turning pathway is the dominant system for natural directional movements."

https://openalex.org/W3022743377,"Glucose is catabolized by two fundamental pathways, glycolysis to make ATP and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway to make reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). The first step of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway is catalyzed by the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). Here we develop metabolite reporter and deuterium tracer assays to monitor cellular G6PD activity. Using these, we show that the most widely cited G6PD antagonist, dehydroepiandosterone, does not robustly inhibit G6PD in cells. We then identify a small molecule (G6PDi-1) that more effectively inhibits G6PD. Across a range of cultured cells, G6PDi-1 depletes NADPH most strongly in lymphocytes. In T cells but not macrophages, G6PDi-1 markedly decreases inflammatory cytokine production. In neutrophils, it suppresses respiratory burst. Thus, we provide a cell-active small molecule tool for oxidative pentose phosphate pathway inhibition, and use it to identify G6PD as a pharmacological target for modulating immune response."
https://openalex.org/W3023115352,"The COMPASS protein family catalyzes histone H3 Lys 4 (H3K4) methylation and its members are essential for regulating gene expression. MLL2/COMPASS methylates H3K4 on many developmental genes and bivalent clusters. To understand MLL2-dependent transcriptional regulation, we performed a CRISPR-based screen with an MLL2-dependent gene as a reporter in mouse embryonic stem cells. We found that MLL2 functions in gene expression by protecting developmental genes from repression via repelling PRC2 and DNA methylation machineries. Accordingly, repression in the absence of MLL2 is relieved by inhibition of PRC2 and DNA methyltransferases. Furthermore, DNA demethylation on such loci leads to reactivation of MLL2-dependent genes not only by removing DNA methylation but also by opening up previously CpG methylated regions for PRC2 recruitment, diluting PRC2 at Polycomb-repressed genes. These findings reveal how the context and function of these three epigenetic modifiers of chromatin can orchestrate transcriptional decisions and demonstrate that prevention of active repression by the context of the enzyme and not H3K4 trimethylation underlies transcriptional regulation on MLL2/COMPASS targets."

https://openalex.org/W3023308582,"The linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), which consists of HOIP, SHARPIN and HOIL-1L, promotes NF-κB activation and protects against cell death by generating linear ubiquitin chains. LUBAC contains two RING-IBR-RING (RBR) ubiquitin ligases (E3), and the HOIP RBR is responsible for catalysing linear ubiquitination. We found that HOIL-1L RBR plays a crucial role in regulating LUBAC. HOIL-1L RBR conjugates monoubiquitin onto all LUBAC subunits, followed by HOIP-mediated conjugation of linear chains onto monoubiquitin, and these linear chains attenuate the functions of LUBAC. The introduction of E3-defective HOIL-1L mutants into cells augmented linear ubiquitination, which protected the cells against Salmonella infection and cured dermatitis caused by reduced LUBAC levels due to SHARPIN loss. Our results reveal a regulatory mode of E3 ligases in which the accessory E3 in LUBAC downregulates the main E3 by providing preferred substrates for autolinear ubiquitination. Thus, inhibition of HOIL-1L E3 represents a promising strategy for treating severe infections or immunodeficiency. Fuseya et al. show that HOIL-1L catalyses monoubiquitination on all three LUBAC subunits, thereby impairing the function of LUBAC and its role in infection defence and dermatitis pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3024503379,"N-acylethanolamines (NAEs), which include the endocannabinoid anandamide, represent an important family of signaling lipids in the brain. The lack of chemical probes that modulate NAE biosynthesis in living systems hamper the understanding of the biological role of these lipids. Using a high-throughput screen, chemical proteomics and targeted lipidomics, we report here the discovery and characterization of LEI-401 as a CNS-active N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD) inhibitor. LEI-401 reduced NAE levels in neuroblastoma cells and in the brain of freely moving mice, but not in NAPE-PLD KO cells and mice, respectively. LEI-401 activated the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis and impaired fear extinction, thereby emulating the effect of a cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist, which could be reversed by a fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitor. Our findings highlight the distinctive role of NAPE-PLD in NAE biosynthesis in the brain and suggest the presence of an endogenous NAE tone controlling emotional behavior. An inhibitor of NAPE-PLD involved in lipid biosynthesis lowers levels of the endocannabinoid anandamide and other N-acylethanolamines in cells and mouse brain and activates the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis and impaired fear extinction."
https://openalex.org/W3021900349,"Tissue homeostasis and regeneration rely on resident stem cells (SCs), whose behaviour is regulated through niche-dependent crosstalk. The mechanisms underlying SC identity are still unfolding. Here, using spatiotemporal gene ablation in murine hair follicles, we uncover a critical role for the transcription factors (TFs) nuclear factor IB (NFIB) and IX (NFIX) in maintaining SC identity. Without NFI TFs, SCs lose their hair-regenerating capability, and produce skin bearing striking resemblance to irreversible human alopecia, which also displays reduced NFIs. Through single-cell transcriptomics, ATAC-Seq and ChIP-Seq profiling, we expose a key role for NFIB and NFIX in governing super-enhancer maintenance of the key hair follicle SC-specific TF genes. When NFIB and NFIX are genetically removed, the stemness epigenetic landscape is lost. Super-enhancers driving SC identity are decommissioned, while unwanted lineages are de-repressed ectopically. Together, our findings expose NFIB and NFIX as crucial rheostats of tissue homeostasis, functioning to safeguard the SC epigenome from a breach in lineage confinement that otherwise triggers irreversible tissue degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3024933428,"Solute carrier family 20 member 2 (SLC20A2) and xenotropic and polytropic retrovirus receptor 1 (XPR1) are transporters with phosphate uptake and efflux functions, respectively. Both are associated with primary familial brain calcification (PFBC), a genetic disease characterized by cerebral calcium-phosphate deposition and associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms. The association of the two transporters with the same disease suggests that they jointly regulate phosphate fluxes and cellular homeostasis, but direct evidence is missing. Here, we found that cross-talk between SLC20A2 and XPR1 regulates phosphate homeostasis, and we identified XPR1 as a key inositol polyphosphate (IP)-dependent regulator of this process. We found that overexpression of WT SLC20A2 increased phosphate uptake, as expected, but also unexpectedly increased phosphate efflux, whereas PFBC-associated SLC20A2 variants did not. Conversely, SLC20A2 depletion decreased phosphate uptake only slightly, most likely compensated for by the related SLC20A1 transporter, but strongly decreased XPR1-mediated phosphate efflux. The SLC20A2-XPR1 axis maintained constant intracellular phosphate and ATP levels, which both increased in XPR1 KO cells. Elevated ATP levels are a hallmark of altered inositol pyrophosphate (PP-IP) synthesis, and basal ATP levels were restored after phosphate efflux rescue with WT XPR1 but not with XPR1 harboring a mutated PP-IP-binding pocket. Accordingly, inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 1-2 (IP6K1-2) gene inactivation or IP6K inhibitor treatment abolished XPR1-mediated phosphate efflux regulation and homeostasis. Our findings unveil an SLC20A2-XPR1 interplay that depends on IPs such as PP-IPs and controls cellular phosphate homeostasis via the efflux route, and alteration of this interplay likely contributes to PFBC."
https://openalex.org/W3012355104,"T cells engineered to express antigen-specific T cell receptors (TCRs) are potent therapies for viral infections and cancer. However, efficient identification of clinical candidate TCRs is complicated by the size and complexity of T cell repertoires and the challenges of working with primary T cells. Here we present a high-throughput method to identify TCRs with high functional avidity from diverse human T cell repertoires. The approach used massively parallel microfluidics to generate libraries of natively paired, full-length TCRαβ clones, from millions of primary T cells, which were then expressed in Jurkat cells. The TCRαβ-Jurkat libraries enabled repeated screening and panning for antigen-reactive TCRs using peptide major histocompatibility complex binding and cellular activation. We captured more than 2.9 million natively paired TCRαβ clonotypes from six healthy human donors and identified rare (<0.001% frequency) viral-antigen-reactive TCRs. We also mined a tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte sample from a patient with melanoma and identified several tumor-specific TCRs, which, after expression in primary T cells, led to tumor cell killing."
https://openalex.org/W3021959262,"Bifunctional Rel stringent factors, the most abundant class of RelA/SpoT homologs, are ribosome-associated enzymes that transfer a pyrophosphate from ATP onto the 3′ of guanosine tri-/diphosphate (GTP/GDP) to synthesize the bacterial alarmone (p)ppGpp, and also catalyze the 3′ pyrophosphate hydrolysis to degrade it. The regulation of the opposing activities of Rel enzymes is a complex allosteric mechanism that remains an active research topic despite decades of research. We show that a guanine-nucleotide-switch mechanism controls catalysis by Thermus thermophilus Rel (RelTt). The binding of GDP/ATP opens the N-terminal catalytic domains (NTD) of RelTt (RelTtNTD) by stretching apart the two catalytic domains. This activates the synthetase domain and allosterically blocks hydrolysis. Conversely, binding of ppGpp to the hydrolase domain closes the NTD, burying the synthetase active site and precluding the binding of synthesis precursors. This allosteric mechanism is an activity switch that safeguards against futile cycles of alarmone synthesis and degradation. Structural and smFRET analysis reveals the mechanism of opposing catalytic activities of bifunctional Rel enzymes; that is, activation of one of the catalytic domains leads to allosteric inactivation of the other."
https://openalex.org/W3026019684,"Background The outbreak of coronavirus disease, 2019 (COVID-19), which started from Wuhan, China, in late 2019, have spread worldwide. A total of 5,91,971 cases and 2,70,90 deaths were registered till 28th March, 2020. We aimed to predict the impact of duration of exposure to COVID-19 on the mortality rates increment. Methods In the present study, data on COVID-19 infected top seven countries viz., Germany, China, France, United Kingdom, Iran, Italy and Spain, and World as a whole, were used for modeling. The analytical procedure of generalized linear model followed by Gompertz link function was used to predict the impact lethal duration of exposure on the mortality rates. Findings Of the selected countries and World as whole, the projection based on 21st March, 2020 cases, suggest that a total (95% Cl) of 76 (65–151) days of exposure in Germany, mortality rate will increase by 5 times to 1%. In countries like France and United Kingdom, our projection suggests that additional exposure of 48 days and 7 days, respectively, will raise the mortality rates to10%. Regarding Iran, Italy and Spain, mortality rate will rise to 10% with an additional 3–10 days of exposure. World’s mortality rates will continue increase by 1% in every three weeks. The predicted interval of lethal duration corresponding to each country has found to be consistent with the mortality rates observed on 28th March, 2020. Conclusion The prediction of lethal duration was found to have apparently effective in predicting mortality, and shows concordance with prevailing rates. In absence of any vaccine against COVID-19 infection, the present study adds information about the quantum of the severity and time elapsed to death will help the Government to take necessary and appropriate steps to control this pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3025114813,"Introduction Disrespect and abuse during labour and birth are increasingly reported all over the world. In 2016, a Dutch client organization initiated an online campaign, #genoeggezwegen (#breakthesilence) which encouraged women to share negative and traumatic maternity care experiences. This study aimed (1) to determine what types of disrespect and abuse were described in #genoeggezwegen and (2) to gain a more detailed understanding of these experiences. Methods A qualitative social media content analysis was carried out in two phases. (1) A deductive coding procedure was carried out to identify types of disrespect and abuse, using Bohren et al.’s existing typology of mistreatment during childbirth. (2) A separate, inductive coding procedure was performed to gain further understanding of the data. Results 438 #genoeggezwegen stories were included. Based on the typology of mistreatment during childbirth, it was found that situations of ineffective communication, loss of autonomy and lack of informed consent and confidentiality were most often described. The inductive analysis revealed five major themes: ‘‘lack of informed consent”; ‘‘not being taken seriously and not being listened to”; ‘‘lack of compassion”; ‘‘use of force”; and ‘‘short and long term consequences”. “Left powerless” was identified as an overarching theme that occurred throughout all five main themes. Conclusion This study gives insight into the negative and traumatic maternity care experiences of Dutch women participating in the #genoeggezwegen campaign. This may indicate that disrespect and abuse during labour and birth do happen in the Netherlands, although the current study gives no insight into prevalence. The findings of this study may increase awareness amongst maternity care providers and the community of the existence of disrespect and abuse in Dutch maternity care, and encourage joint effort on improving care both individually and systemically/institutionally."

https://openalex.org/W3025783653,"Subjective Cognitive Complaints (SCCs) may represent one of the earliest stages of preclinical dementia. The objective of the present study was to extend previous work by our group to examine the relationship between participant-reported and informant-reported memory and non-memory SCCs, cognitive decline and incident dementia, over a six-year period. Participants were 873 community dwelling older adults (Mage = 78.65, SD = 4.79) without dementia and 843 informants (close friends or family) from the Sydney Memory and Ageing Study. Comprehensive neuropsychological testing and diagnostic assessments were carried out at baseline and biennially for six years. Linear mixed models and Cox proportional hazard models were performed to determine the association of SCCs, rate of cognitive decline and risk of incident dementia, controlling demographics and covariates of mood and personality. Participant and informant memory-specific SCCs were associated with rate of global cognitive decline; for individual cognitive domains, participant memory SCCs predicted decline for language, while informant memory SCCs predicted decline for executive function and memory. Odds of incident dementia were associated with baseline participant memory SCCs and informant memory and non-memory SCCs in partially adjusted models. In fully adjusted models, only informant SCCs were associated with increased risk of incident dementia. Self-reported memory-specific cognitive complaints are associated with decline in global cognition over 6-years and may be predictive of incident dementia, particularly if the individual is depressed or anxious and has increased neuroticism or decreased openness. Further, if and where possible, informants should be sought and asked to report on their perceptions of the individual's memory ability and any memory-specific changes that they have noticed as these increase the index of diagnostic suspicion."
https://openalex.org/W3025519068,"Isoetes sinensis Palmer is a critically endangered, first-class protected plant in China. Until now, researchers have primarily focused on the ultrastructure, phylogeny, and transcriptomes of the plant. However, flavonoid profiles and bioactivity of I. sinensis have not been extensively investigated. To develop the endangered I. sinensis for edible and medicinal purposes, flavonoid content, chemical constitution, and antioxidant activities were investigated in this study. Results revealed the following. 1) The total flavonoid content was determined as 10.74 ± 0.25 mg/g., 2) Antioxidant activities were stronger than most ferns, especially ABTS free radical scavenging activities. 3) Four flavones, containing apigenin, apigenin-7-glucuronide, acacetin-7-O-glcopyranoside, and homoplantageninisoetin; four flavonols, namely, isoetin, kaempferol-3-O-glucoside, quercetin-3-O-[6""-O-(3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl)-β-D-glucopyranoside], and limocitrin-Neo; one prodelphinidin (procyanidins;) and one nothofagin (dihydrochalcone) were tentatively identified in the mass spectrometry-DAD (254nm) chromatograms. This study was the first to report on flavonoid content and antioxidant activities of I. sinensis. Stronger antioxidant activity and flavonoid content suggests that the endangered I. sinensis is an important and potentially edible and medicinal plant."
https://openalex.org/W3026031459,"The trail-making test (TMT) is a popular neuropsychological test, which is used extensively to measure cognitive impairment associated with neurodegenerative disorders in older adults. Behavioural performance on the TMT has been investigated in older populations, but there is limited research on task-related brain activity in older adults. The current study administered a naturalistic version of the TMT to a healthy older-aged population in an MRI environment using a novel, MRI-compatible tablet. Functional MRI was conducted during task completion, allowing characterization of the brain activity associated with the TMT. Performance on the TMT was evaluated using number of errors and seconds per completion of each link. Results are reported for 36 cognitively healthy older adults between the ages of 52 and 85. Task-related activation was observed in extensive regions of the bilateral frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobes as well as key motor areas. Increased age was associated with reduced brain activity and worse task performance. Specifically, older age was correlated with decreased task-related activity in the bilateral occipital, temporal and parietal lobes. These results suggest that healthy older aging significantly affects brain function during the TMT, which consequently may result in performance decrements. The current study reveals the brain activation patterns underlying TMT performance in a healthy older aging population, which functions as an important, clinically-relevant control to compare to pathological aging in future investigations."
https://openalex.org/W3025114925,"There is a significant organ shortage in the field of liver transplantation, partly due to a high discard rate of steatotic livers from donors. These organs are known to function poorly if transplanted but make up a significant portion of the available pool of donated livers. This study demonstrates the ability to improve the function of steatotic rat livers using a combination of ex situ machine perfusion and a “defatting” drug cocktail. After 6 hours of perfusion, defatted livers demonstrated lower perfusate lactate levels and improved bile quality as demonstrated by higher bile bicarbonate and lower bile lactate. Furthermore, defatting was associated with decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased expression of enzymes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. Rehabilitation of marginal or discarded steatotic livers using machine perfusion and tailored drug therapy can significantly increase the supply of donor livers for transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W3021841533,"Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) caused by oncogenic Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a highly angiogenic and invasive vascular tumor and the most common AIDS-associated cancer. KSHV-encoded viral interleukin-6 (vIL-6) is implicated in the development of KSHV-induced malignancies; however, the mechanisms underlying vIL-6-induced angiogenesis and tumorigenesis remain undefined. Here, we show that vIL-6 promotes angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and invasion by downregulating caveolin 1 (CAV1) that plays a pivotal and versatile role in multiple cancer-associated processes. Mechanistically, vIL-6 signaling led to the phosphorylation and acetylation of STAT3 that targeted DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) in a sequential manner. Specifically, the vIL-6-induced phosphorylated form of STAT3 transcriptionally activated DNMT1 expression. Furthermore, vIL-6-induced acetylated form of STAT3 interacted with DNMT1 to form a transcription factor complex that bound to and methylated the CAV1 promoter, leading to CAV1 expression silencing. In fact, downregulation of CAV1 expression resulted in the activation of AKT signaling, promoting cell invasion, and growth transformation induced by KSHV. Finally, genetic deletion of vIL-6 from the KSHV genome abolished KSHV-induced cellular transformation and impaired angiogenesis. Our results reveal that vIL-6 epigenetically silences CAV1 expression to promote angiogenesis and tumorigenesis by regulating the formation of STAT3-DNMT1 complex. These novel findings define a mechanism by which KSHV inhibits the CAV1 pathway and establish the scientific basis for targeting this pathway to treat KSHV-associated cancers."
https://openalex.org/W3023105362,"N-Methyl-d-aspartate type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) are key mediators of synaptic activity-regulated gene transcription in neurons, both during development and in the adult brain. Developmental differences in the glutamate receptor ionotropic NMDA 2 (GluN2) subunit composition of NMDARs determines whether they activate the transcription factor cAMP-responsive element-binding protein 1 (CREB). However, whether the developmentally regulated GluN3A subunit also modulates NMDAR-induced transcription is unknown. Here, using an array of techniques, including quantitative real-time PCR, immunostaining, reporter gene assays, RNA-Seq, and two-photon glutamate uncaging with calcium imaging, we show that knocking down GluN3A in rat hippocampal neurons promotes the inducible transcription of a subset of NMDAR-sensitive genes. We found that this enhancement is mediated by the accumulation of phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in the nucleus, which drives the activation of the transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C) and promotes the transcription of a subset of synaptic activity-induced genes, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) and activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc). Our evidence that GluN3A regulates MEF2C-dependent transcription reveals a novel mechanism by which NMDAR subunit composition confers specificity to the program of synaptic activity-regulated gene transcription in developing neurons."
https://openalex.org/W3025664427,"The aim of this study was to identify breeding practices and trait preferences for indigenous sheep in three districts (Estie, Farta and Lay Gayient) located in the northwest highlands of Ethiopia. Questionnaire survey and choice experiment methods were used to collect data from 370 smallholder farmers. Respondents were selected randomly among smallholder farmers who own sheep in the aforementioned districts. A generalized multinomial logit model was employed to examine preferences for sheep attributes, while descriptive statistics and index values were computed to describe sheep breeding practices. Having the highest index value of 0.36, income generation was ranked as the primary reason for keeping sheep, followed by meat and manure sources. The average flock size per smallholder farmer was 10.21 sheep. The majority of the smallholder farmers (91%) have the experience of selecting breeding rams and ewes within their own flock using diverse criteria. Given the highest index value of 0.34, body size was ranked as a primary ram and ewe selection criteria, followed by coat color. Furthermore, choice modeling results revealed that tail type, body size, coat color, growth rate, horn and ear size have shown significant influences on smallholder farmers' preference for breeding rams (P<0.01). The part-worth utility coefficients were positive for all ram attributes except ear size. For breeding ewes, mothering ability, coat color, body size, lambing interval, growth rate, tail type and litter size have shown significant effects on choice preferences of smallholder farmers (P<0.05). Moreover, significant scale heterogeneity was observed among respondents for ewe attributes (P<0.001). Overall, the results implied that sheep breeding objectives suitable for the northwest highlands of the country can be derived from traits such as linear body measurement, weight and survival at different ages, and lambing intervals. However, selection decisions at the smallholder level should not only be based on estimated breeding values of traits included in the breeding objective but instead, incorporate ways to address farmers' preference for qualitative traits."

To isolate indigenous microbial consortia, anaerobic baltch media were prepared and inoculated with the formation water; incubated at 65°C for 10 days. Further, the microbial metabolites were analyzed by gas chromatography, FTIR and surface tension. The efficiency of isolated consortia towards enhancing oil recovery was analyzed through core flood assay. The novelty of studied consortia was that, it produces biomass (600 mg/l), bio-surfactant (325 mg/l), and volatile fatty acids (250 mg/l) at 65°C in the span of 10 days, that are adequate to alter the surface tension (70 to 34 mNm -1) and sweep efficiency of zones facilitating the displacement of oil. TERIK was identified as Clostridium sp. The FTIR spectra of biosurfactant indicate the presence of N-H stretch, amides and polysaccharide. A core flooding assay was designed to explore the potential of TERIK towards enhancing oil recovery. The results showed an effective reduction in permeability at residual oil saturation from 2.14 ± 0.1 to 1.39 ± 0.05 mD and 19% incremental oil recovery."

HlyA preferentially binds the αLβ2 integrin LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18) of leukocytes and can promiscuously bind and also permeabilize many other cells. CyaA bears an N-terminal adenylyl cyclase (AC) domain linked to a pore-forming RTX cytolysin (Hly) moiety, binds the complement receptor 3 (CR3, αMβ2, CD11b/CD18, or Mac-1) of myeloid phagocytes, penetrates their plasma membrane, and delivers the AC enzyme into the cytosol. We constructed a set of CyaA/HlyA chimeras and show that the CyaC-acylated segment and the CR3-binding RTX domain of CyaA can be functionally replaced by the HlyC-acylated segment and the much shorter RTX domain of HlyA. Instead of binding CR3, a CyaA1-710/HlyA411-1024 chimera bound the LFA-1 receptor and effectively delivered AC into Jurkat T cells. At high chimera concentrations (25 nm), the interaction with LFA-1 was not required for CyaA1-710/HlyA411-1024 binding to CHO cells. However, interaction with the LFA-1 receptor strongly enhanced the specific capacity of the bound CyaA1-710/HlyA411-1024 chimera to penetrate cells and deliver the AC enzyme into their cytosol. Hence, interaction of the acylated segment and/or the RTX domain of HlyA with LFA-1 promoted a productive membrane interaction of the chimera. These results help delimit residues 400–710 of CyaA as an “AC translocon” sufficient for translocation of the AC polypeptide across the plasma membrane of target cells.

CyaA is a 1706-residue–long polypeptide (Fig. 1) that inserts directly into the plasma membrane of target cells, and without the need for endocytosis, it delivers directly into the cell cytosol an N-terminal adenylyl cyclase (AC) enzyme domain of ∼400 residues (5Gordon V.M.

Within eukaryotic cells, the AC enzyme is activated by binding of cytosolic calmodulin and rapidly catalyzes unregulated conversion of intracellular ATP to the key second messenger signaling molecule cAMP (6Wolff J.

Due to an extremely high catalytic power of the activated AC enzyme, the CyaA toxin was found to detectably bind and promiscuously elevate cytosolic cAMP concentrations in a broad array of eukaryotic cells, most likely due to a low affinity binding to glycan moieties of gangliosides and N-linked glycans of surface glycoproteins (7Gordon V.M.

However, the specific efficacy of cell binding, penetration, and cAMP intoxication of target cells by the CyaA toxin is enhanced by about 2 orders of magnitude through an interaction of CyaA with the CD11b subunit of the αMβ2 integrin receptor (CD11b/CD18), known as the complement receptor 3 (CR3), or Mac-1 of myeloid phagocytes (10Guermonprez P.

The key biological role of the Hly moiety of CyaA would consist in the delivery of the AC domain into cytosol of target cells. The Hly moiety harbors all structural information involved in the translocation of the “passive passenger” AC domain polypeptide across the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane. Indeed, the Hly can deliver instead of the AC domain also large heterologous or artificial polypeptides, providing that these bear a net overall positive charge and do not adopt a stably folded tertiary structure (22Gmira S.

Furthermore, the pore-forming and the AC translocating activities associated with the Hly polypeptide appear to be functionally fully independent and occur in parallel, being most likely associated with alternative conformers of the same Hly moiety. In fact, the oligomeric pores formed by Hly appear as too small (0.6–0.8 nm in diameter) for passage of even an unfolded polypeptide chain (13Benz R. Maier E. Ladant D. Ullmann A. Sebo P. Adenylate cyclase toxin (CyaA) of Bordetella pertussis. Evidence for the formation of small ion-permeable channels and comparison with HlyA of Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269 (7525549): 27231-27239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, specific nonhemolytic CyaA mutant variants, unable to form membrane pores and permeabilize cellular membrane, do still efficiently deliver the AC polypeptide across the target membrane into the cytosol of cells (26Osickova A.

Hence, it appears that for AC polypeptide translocation across the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane it is the membrane-penetrating capacity of the hydrophobic (pore-forming) domain of the Hly moiety that is required and not its capacity to form membrane pores. The Hly portion involved in AC domain translocation consists of several subdomains of CyaA (Fig. 1). Its most N-terminal portion forms an “AC-to-Hly linking segment” (residues ∼400 to 500) that participates in membrane penetration of the toxin (27Masin J. Osickova A. Sukova A. Fiser R. Halada P.

In the absence of structural data, the transmembrane topology and organization of the CyaA translocon that delivers the AC polypeptide across the cell membrane remains elusive. Translocation of the AC enzyme across the cell membrane is a rapid process with a half-time of dozen of seconds (43Rogel A. Hanski E.

It occurs from cholesterol-enriched membrane lipid microdomains (lipid rafts), into which the membrane inserted CyaA laterally separates together with its receptor CD11b/CD18, once the membrane-inserted toxin has opened a transient conduit for influx of extracellular calcium ions into cells (44Bumba L.

Yet the biological effects of different RAS mutations and the tissue-specific clinical implications are complex and nuanced. Here, we identified an internal tandem duplication (ITD) in the switch II domain of NRAS from a patient with extremely aggressive colorectal carcinoma. Results of whole-exome DNA sequencing of primary and metastatic tumors indicated that this mutation was present in all analyzed metastases and excluded the presence of any other clear oncogenic driver mutations. Biochemical analysis revealed increased interaction of the RAS ITD with Raf proto-oncogene Ser/Thr kinase (RAF), leading to increased phosphorylation of downstream MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK). The ITD prevented interaction with neurofibromin 1 (NF1)–GTPase–activating protein (GAP), providing a mechanism for sustained activity of the RAS ITD protein. We present the first crystal structures of NRAS and KRAS ITD at 1.65–1.75 Å resolution, respectively, providing insight into the physical interactions of this class of RAS variants with its regulatory and effector proteins. Our in-depth bedside-to-bench analysis uncovers the molecular mechanism underlying a case of highly aggressive colorectal cancer and illustrates the importance of robust biochemical and biophysical approaches in the implementation of individualized medicine.

Our in-depth bedside-to-bench analysis uncovers the molecular mechanism underlying a case of highly aggressive colorectal cancer and illustrates the importance of robust biochemical and biophysical approaches in the implementation of individualized medicine. Driver mutations in KRAS, primarily at codons 12, 13, 61, and 146, have been well-characterized and are identified in 35–40% of cases of colorectal cancer (CRC). An additional 5–10% of CRC cases harbor a mutation in NRAS at functionally identical codons. RAS mutations are associated with decreased response to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition and increased incidence of distant metastasis (1De Roock W. De Vriendt V. Normanno N. Ciardiello F. Tejpar S. KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, and PTEN mutations: Implications for targeted therapies in metastatic colorectal cancer.Lancet Oncol. 2011; 12 (21163703): 594-60310.1016/S1470-2045(10)70209-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Recent advances in clinical genomic profiling have expanded recommended testing to look for a broader spectrum of mutations in KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF in patients with metastatic CRC to guide therapy planning with anti-EGFR–targeted agents. This expansion has led to the identification of rare or previously uncharacterized RAS mutations. Further, the clinical characteristics of NRAS-mutated CRCs have not been well-established because of their relatively low prevalence. There is a gap in our knowledge about the biological function and overall oncogenic role of less common forms of RAS mutations, especially within NRAS. Here, our collaborative research team reports characterization of a newly identified NRAS internal tandem duplication (ITD) of 10 amino acids within the switch II domain, in a patient with exceptionally widespread CRC (>100 individual metastatic sites) that underwent clinical next-generation sequencing (NGS) testing (2Henzler C.

Med. 2018; 6 (29911110): 16210.21037/atm.2018.05.07Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The prevalence of such RAS ITDs in CRC is unclear, and at the time of initial diagnosis (2015), we found literature reports of only three prior CRC patients with this type of duplication in KRAS (3Guedes J.G.

Bagchi A. Van Ziffle J. Inguva A. Bollag G. Zhang C. Carias H. Dickens D. Loh M. Shannon K. Firestone A.J. KRAS insertion mutations are oncogenic and exhibit distinct functional properties.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 (26854029): 1064710.1038/ncomms10647Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and a report of RAS-family ITDs in up to 2% of vascular malformation/overgrowth syndrome cases (7Eijkelenboom A. van Schaik F.M.A. van Es R.M. Ten Broek R.W. Rinne T. van der Vleuten C. Flucke U. Ligtenberg M.J.L. Rehmann H. Functional characterisation of a novel class of in-frame insertion variants of KRAS and HRAS.Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 (31160609): 823910.1038/s41598-019-44584-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). We sought to elucidate the crystal structure of this previously uncharacterized NRAS ITD, and performed extensive functional characterization to determine its effects on RAS biological activity in relation to other known oncogenic RAS mutations. The patient was a 48-year-old man with widely metastatic colorectal cancer. Initial KRAS Sanger sequencing (the institutional standard of care at that time) of his primary tumor was negative for pathogenic mutations. Despite ongoing treatment that included blockade of epidermal growth factor receptor (based on KRAS WT status only), the patient experienced further metastatic progression (including to the brain). Therefore, a focused clinical NGS panel was used to assess a cerebellar lesion for mutations in KRAS, NRAS, HRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA. This posttreatment testing panel identified an in-frame duplication of 30 nucleotides in exon 3 of NRAS (NM_002524:c.164_193dup, p.I55_Y64dup (Table S1); the variant allele fraction was 25% in the context of an estimated tumor cellularity of 50%. At the time of this diagnosis, no in-frame insertions of this size or larger were catalogued within NRAS exon 3 in the COSMIC database (8Forbes S.A. Beare D. Gunasekaran P. Leung K. Bindal N. Boutselakis H. Ding M. Bamford S. Cole C. Ward S. Kok C.Y. Jia M. De T. Teague J.W. Stratton M.R. et al.COSMIC: Exploring the world’s knowledge of somatic mutations in human cancer.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 (25355519): D805-D81110.1093/nar/gku1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar) and the published literature for this type of mutation in CRC was sparse (5Wójcik P. Kulig J. Okoń K. Zazula M. Moździoch I. Niepsuj A. Stachura J. KRAS mutation profile in colorectal carcinoma and novel mutation–internal tandem duplication in KRAS.Pol. J. Pathol. 2008; 59 (18669174): 93-96PubMed Google Scholar); thus, the clinical and biological significance of this alteration was initially uncertain. This NRAS ITD is located within the switch II domain of the protein, which includes the Gln-61 amino acid critical for GTP hydrolysis (9Rajalingam K. Schreck R. Rapp U.R. Albert S. Ras oncogenes and their downstream targets.Biochim. Biophys.

Given the paucity of clinical information but with a plausible biological mechanism, this mutation was interpreted as a variant with possible clinical significance (10Li M.M. Datto M. Duncavage E.J.

No other mutations in BRAF, PIK3CA, KRAS, or HRAS were identified. Unfortunately, the patient's disease continued to rapidly progress and he passed away 2 weeks later. An autopsy was performed, which catalogued >100 individual metastatic lesions within nearly all solid organs. To further characterize the patient’s malignancy, three metastatic sites (cerebellum, lung, and liver) plus the archived primary tumor from the surgical resection were assessed by a clinically focused solid tumor NGS panel of 13 genes. The NRAS ITD was identified in all four samples, confirming that this mutation was present in the primary tumor and in three independent metastatic sites that developed at different times during the patient’s disease course (Table S2). In addition, a pathogenic TP53 mutation (NM_000546: c.824G>T, p.C275F) was identified in the primary tumor and all three metastatic sites. No other pathogenic mutations were identified in the remaining 11 clinically relevant genes assessed in these four samples at the time of autopsy. Given the lack of additional potential driver mutations on the targeted clinical cancer NGS panel, we used whole-exome NGS of the archived primary tumor, lung metastasis, and cerebellar metastasis to more extensively explore whether other genomic drivers were responsible for the aggressive clinical course of the disease. Variant annotation and filtering identified 847 potentially significant somatic variants in the primary tumor and an additional 551 potentially significant variants that were unique to the two metastatic lesions (i.e. variants not identified in the primary tumor) (Fig. 1A). These variant lists were further prioritized for loss of function variants (frameshift indels or nonsense), in-frame indels, canonical splice site variants, and single nucleotide missense variants with high-to-moderate Mutation Assessor functional impact scores (11Reva B. Antipin Y. Sander C. Predicting the functional impact of protein mutations: Application to cancer genomics.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39 (21727090): e11810.1093/nar/gkr407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar); this process left 169, 58, and 72 prioritized variants for review in the primary, lung, and central nervous system (CNS) lesions, respectively (Data File S1). Overall, somatic exome analysis of the patient’s primary colon tumor, lung, and CNS metastasis confirmed that the NRAS ITD was present in the majority of tumor cells in all sites of disease studied. Further, no other clear mechanistic driver mutations were identified by whole-exome sequencing. Loss of tumor suppressive functions of TP53 and CSMD1 likely contributed to the aggressive phenotype of the malignancy. Interestingly, the presence of NRAS or CSMD1 mutations, either alone or in combination, was associated with decreased overall survival in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) CRC dataset (Fig. 1C) (12Cancer Genome Atlas Network Comprehensive molecular characterization of human colon and rectal cancer.Nature. 2012; 487 (22810696): 330-33710.1038/nature11252Crossref PubMed Scopus (5014) Google Scholar, 13Cerami E.

We hypothesized that this type of duplication may have been missed by the bioinformatics pipelines that produced the published datasets, so we performed a focused re-analysis of the RAS genes using the primary sequencing files from several TCGA projects using the ScanIndel bioinformatics pipeline (15Yang R. Nelson A.C. Henzler C. Thyagarajan B. Silverstein K.A. ScanIndel: A hybrid framework for indel detection via gapped alignment, split reads and de novo assembly.Genome Med. 2015; 7 (26643039): 12710.1186/s13073-015-0251-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), which has been optimized to detect longer insertion mutations. We analyzed the colorectal adenocarcinoma (n = 634), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n = 186), lung adenocarcinoma (n = 586), and lung squamous cell carcinoma (n = 511) TCGA datasets. No clinically significant in-frame insertion mutations within NRAS, KRAS, or HRAS were identified across these studies. This analysis suggests that somatic in-frame insertion mutations (including ITDs) within RAS genes are potentially a rare event in the pathogenesis of RAS-related solid cancers. However, the size of these cohorts are likely not large enough to confidently estimate the prevalence of rare but clinically important cancer gene alterations (16Lawrence M.S. Stojanov P. Mermel C.H.

To determine the functional activity of the NRAS ITD protein, we used bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) to detect protein–protein interactions in live, intact cells (17Bacart J. Corbel C. Jockers R. Bach S. Couturier C. The BRET technology and its application to screening assays.Biotechnol.

We cotransfected the human colorectal cancer cell line Caco-2 and the immortalized human embryonic kidney HEK293T cells with plasmids expressing ITD mutant or WT RAS proteins linked to a HaloTag acceptor together with plasmids expressing the RAS effector RAF1 tagged with a NanoLuc (NLuc) bioluminescent donor construct. In saturation experiments, cells were transfected with a constant amount of the RAF1-NLuc donor construct in the presence of increasing amounts of the indicated RAS-HaloTag acceptor constructs. We generated saturation curves for the interactions between RAF1 and WT KRAS, WT NRAS, ITD mutant KRAS, Q61R mutant KRAS, and ITD mutant NRAS (Fig. 2). Curves were produced by a hyperbolic nonlinear regression and the BRET50 was calculated (curve fit parameters provided in Tables S3–S6). The BRET50 is the concentration of transfected acceptor DNA that generates a bioluminescence signal at 50% of the maximum (BRETmax); lower values of BRET50 are consistent with higher affinity of interaction. These experiments showed a greater affinity between RAF1 and the internal duplication mutants compared with the WT proteins (Fig. 2, A–C). Biologically, other known carcinogenic point mutations in RAS (KRAS Q61R) recruit RAF1 with higher affinity, leading to more downstream signaling (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that the 10–amino acid ITD (in both NRAS and KRAS) drives interactions with the effector RAF1 at a similar level of potency to the well-characterized Q61R oncogenic missense mutation. To further demonstrate the biological relevance of the increased affinity of NRAS ITD to RAF in cells, we evaluated the effect of expression of the internal duplication mutants on downstream signaling pathways. Transfection of increasing amounts of NRAS ITD plasmid construct into Caco-2 cells showed a significant induction of MAP kinase signaling, measured by both ERK and MEK phosphorylation in Western blots (Fig. 3A). This pathway activation was similar to that of the established oncogenic mutant NRAS Q61R (Fig. 3A). Moreover, when overexpressed in HEK293T cells, both the NRAS and the KRAS internal tandem duplication mutants showed increases in both ERK and MEK phosphorylation when compared with the WT proteins (Fig. 3, B and C). The signaling activation by the KRAS ITD protein was similar to levels induced by the common KRAS G12D oncogenic mutant (Fig. 3D). These results were consistently produced across three independent experiments (Fig. S1), providing clear evidence that a functional consequence of the ITD mutation is constitutive activation of the oncogenic MAP kinase signaling pathway. To examine the effect of the ITD in RAS on its interaction with GAP and its effector proteins, we purified the recombinant GTPase domain (1–169) of NRAS and KRAS with and without the ITD and carried out binding studies using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). We compared the binding of WT NRAS and NRAS ITD with NF1 GAP and RAF1 effector proteins. ITC experiments showed that WT NRAS and KRAS bound to NF1 (GRD, GAP-related domain) with high affinity (Kd = 1 μm) as reported previously (19Rabara D. Tran T.H. Dharmaiah S. Stephens R.M. McCormick F. Simanshu D.K. Holderfield M. KRAS G13D sensitivity to neurofibromin-mediated GTP hydrolysis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2019; 116 (31611389): 22122-2213110.1073/pnas.1908353116Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), whereas ITD mutants of NRAS and KRAS showed complete loss of binding to NF1, suggesting that the ITD resulted in fully impaired GAP-mediated GTPase activity (Fig. 4A and Fig. S2B). Unlike NF1 GAP, both WT and ITD mutants of NRAS and KRAS bound to RAF1 (RBD, RAS-binding domain) with similar affinity in vitro, confirming that the ITD does not negatively affect RAF1 binding (Fig. 4B and Fig. S2C). This biochemical evidence is consistent with the cell biology data (Figure 2, Figure 3) showing increased physiological interaction between RAS ITD and RAF with subsequently increased MAPK signaling. To explore the lack of NF1-GAP:RAS ITD binding further, we returned to our BRET cell-based expression system. By co-expressing NF1 with the RAF1 and RAS constructs, we demonstrated biologically that NF1 expression significantly decreased the peak mBRET signal for WT RAS constructs, but had no effect on the RAS ITD constructs (Fig. 4C). This finding confirmed within an intact cell model system that the switch II ITD prevented effective interaction of RAS with GAP protein, leading to sustained activity. Next, we examined the effect of ITD on the intrinsic and GAP-mediated GTP hydrolysis in RAS using a fluorescent-based assay in the absence and presence of NF1, respectively, in the reaction mixture. Interestingly, the presence of NF1 GAP, which has been shown to increase the rate of intrinsic GTP hydrolysis by 105-fold for WT RAS, failed to stimulate any increase in the rate of GTP hydrolysis for RAS ITD (Fig. S3). These results suggest that ITD disrupts RAS interaction with GAP protein and results in loss of GAP-mediated GTP hydrolysis. To understand the effect of ITD on RAS tertiary structure and RAS interactions with GAP and effector proteins, we crystallized and solved the structure of GDP-bound NRAS ITD and KRAS ITD to a resolution of 1.65 Å and 1.75 Å, respectively (Fig. 5, A and B and Table S7). In the NRAS ITD structure, a major part of ITD in the switch II region showed no interpretable electron density suggesting that this region is likely to be very flexible or disordered inside the crystal (Fig. 5A). In the KRAS ITD structure, most of the amino acids that are part of the ITD region had interpretable electron density as it is stabilized by crystal contact, which suggests that the observed conformation showing a large conformational change in the switch II region is one of the snapshots of many possible conformations for the highly dynamic ITD (Fig. 5B and Fig. S4, A and B). The region with uninterpretable electron density in the KRAS ITD structure includes the last three residues of the ITD (residues 72–74) and the six residues (residues 75–80) present at the end of switch II. In the KRAS ITD structure, residues Glu-63 and Tyr-64 make a helical turn which is followed by a seven-residue (Ile-65–Gln-71) long loop in the middle of the switch II region, which protrudes away from the core of the protein. The B-factor of ITD and switch II region is higher than rest of the protein, suggesting that this region is likely to be the most flexible part of the protein. Structural superposition of GDP-bound NRAS ITD with GDP-bound KRAS ITD shows similar tertiary structure with a partially disordered switch II region due to ITD mutation (Fig. 5C). Structural comparison of GDP-bound NRAS ITD with GMPPNP-bound WT NRAS highlighted similar tertiary structure including the switch I region and the difference in the switch II because of the ITD (Fig. 5D). Structural superposition of the KRAS ITD with the previously solved structures of KRAS-NF1 GAP complex (PDB ID: 6OB2), HRAS-PI3Kγ complex (PDB ID: 1HE8), and HRAS-RAF1(RBD) complex (PDB ID: 4G0N) showed a steric clash of RAS ITD in the case of NF1 and PI3Kγ, but not in the case of RAF1 (Fig. 5, E–G). This observation is aligned with previous results that have shown the RAS–RAF1 interaction is limited to switch I (20Thapar R. Williams J.G. Campbell S.L. NMR characterization of full-length farnesylated and non-farnesylated H-Ras and its implications for Raf activation.J. Mol.

Tran T.H. Dharmaiah S. Stephens R.M. McCormick F. Simanshu D.K. Holderfield M. KRAS G13D sensitivity to neurofibromin-mediated GTP hydrolysis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To examine the effect of ITD on RAS–PI3Kγ interaction, we measured the binding affinity of WT NRAS and NRAS ITD with PI3Kγ using the ITC experiment. Results from the ITC experiments showed that WT NRAS binds to PI3Kγ with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 8.3 μm, whereas NRAS ITD showed complete loss of binding to PI3Kγ (Fig. S2A). This observation provides additional evidence that the presence of ITD results in loss of interaction between RAS and PI3Kγ. In the surface representation, RAS ITD does seem to clash with RAF1-RBD partially. However, the ITC results that show that RAS ITD binds to RAF1-RBD with similar affinity as that of WT RAS, and the flexibility seen for the ITD region in the crystal structures described here, make it clear that the ITD has no effect on RAS interaction with RAF1-RBD (Fig. S5). Unlike oncogenic mutations that are limited to a different side chain at a single amino acid, this ITD of 10 residues creates a significant steric clash that is likely to result in complete loss of binding of GAP protein to RAS ITD. We report the biochemical, biophysical, and functional characterization of a NRAS ITD mutation that disrupts the switch II domain and prevents GAP-mediated GTP hydrolysis. This ITD was identified in a patient with extremely aggressive, therapeutically resistant, colonic adenocarcinoma in which whole-exome analysis did not reveal any other activating, driver mutations. This NRAS ITD demonstrated increased affinity with BRAF, suggesting decreased hydrolysis of GTP and thus prolonged RAS activation and downstream effects. In a clinical context, identification of less common variants of oncogenic RAS over the past decade has expanded the pool of testable mutations that help predict biological behavior and predict therapeutic efficacy of drugs such as inhibitors of EGFR in patients with metastatic CRC. Despite expansion of clinical RAS sequencing platforms, concern remains that additional variants are not routinely detected, and can thus affect clinical outcomes. Although interrogation of several TCGA datasets suggest ITDs have a low prevalence in solid malignancies, we have subsequently identified a similar 27–base pair, 9–amino acid insertion mutation in the switch II domain of KRAS (NM_004985: c. 162_188dup; p. D54_E62dup) in a case of pancreatic adenocarcinoma at our institution. The increasing reports of RAS ITD in a spectrum of malignancies from our institution and others indicate that the ITD is a clinically important, albeit rare, form of RAS mutation. The biological activity of larger switch II insertions appear to be substantial, as this ITD facilitates RAS–RAF interaction in a cell biology system that leads to increased MAPK signaling. More specifically, the ITD blocks the interaction of RAS-GAP in vitro, and our cell biology system confirms that GAP co-expression does not diminish sustained RAS ITD:RAF1 affinity/interaction. Furthermore, by solving the crystal structure of GDP-bound RAS ITD, we provide convincing structural evidence that the 10 amino acid ITD blocks RAS-GAP binding, and provide insights into the interactions of the RAS ITD with other effector proteins. Our data suggest that ITDs of this length lead to constitutive activation of RAS with significant biological and clinical consequences. The work shown here is consistent with findings seen in other limited reports of RAS ITDs. A prior report of a 7–amino acid RAS ITD identified in a pediatric hematologic malignancy provided functional and biochemical data supporting an oncogenic phenotype (6White Y. Bagchi A. Van Ziffle J.

The different biological properties of RAS isoforms (KRAS, HRAS, and NRAS) are mainly dictated by differences in the hypervariable region (i.e. the last 20 residues at the C-terminal end) as well as preferences for different membrane environments and tissue-specific expression patterns (22Castellano E. Santos E. Functional specificity of ras isoforms: So similar but so different.Genes Cancer. 2011; 2 (21779495): 216-23110.1177/1947601911408081Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). However, the G-domain of these RAS isoforms is very similar, and in biochemical and structural experiments, Gly-12, Gly-13, and Gln-61 mutants of KRAS and NRAS often behave very similarly.

To examine evidence for select viral infections among patients with SARI in northern Vietnam, we studied 348 nasopharyngeal samples from military and civilian patients admitted to 4 hospitals in the greater Hanoi area from 2017-2019. Initial screening for human respiratory viral pathogens was performed in Hanoi, Vietnam at the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (NIHE) or the Military Institute of Preventative Medicine (MIPM), and an aliquot was shipped to Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore for validation. Patient demographics were recorded and used to epidemiologically describe the infections. Among military and civilian cases of SARI, 184 (52.9%) tested positive for one or more respiratory viruses. Influenza A virus was the most prevalent virus detected (64.7%), followed by influenza B virus (29.3%), enterovirus (3.8%), adenovirus (1.1%), and coronavirus (1.1%). Risk factor analyses demonstrated an increased risk of influenza A virus detection among military hospital patients (adjusted OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.2-3.2), and an increased risk of influenza B virus detection among patients enrolled in year 2017 (adjusted OR, 7.9; 95% CI, 2.7-22.9).

https://openalex.org/W3025332146,"Vascular injury leads to membrane disruption, ATP release, and endothelial dysfunction. Increases in the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) and decreases in the phosphorylation of Niban, a protein implicated in ER stress and apoptosis, are associated with vascular injury. A cell permeant phosphopeptide mimetic of Niban (NiPp) was generated. The effects of NiPp in restoring endothelial function were determined ex vivo using intact rat aortic tissue (RA) after pharmacological activation of p38 MAPK and also in multiple clinically relevant injury models. Anisomycin (Aniso) increased p38 MAPK phosphorylation and reduced endothelial-dependent relaxation in RA. Treatment with NiPp prevented Ansio-induced reduction in endothelial function and increases in p38 MAPK phosphorylation. NiPp treatment also restored endothelial function after stretch injury (subfailure stretch), treatment with acidic Normal Saline (NS), and P2X7R activation with 2′(3′)-O-(4-Benzoylbenzoyl)adenosine 5′-triphosphate (BzATP). Aged, diseased, human saphenous vein (HSV) remnants obtained from patients undergoing coronary bypass surgical procedures have impaired endothelial function. Treatment of these HSV segments with NiPp improved endothelial-dependent relaxation. Kinome screening experiments indicated that NiPp inhibits p38 MAPK. These data demonstrate that p38 MAPK and Niban signaling have a role in endothelial function, particularly in response to injury. Niban may represent an endogenous regulator of p38 MAPK activation. The NiPp peptide may serve as an experimental tool to further elucidate p38 MAPK regulation and as a potential therapeutic for endothelial dysfunction."

https://openalex.org/W3025309591,"Background Pooling individual participant data to enable pooled analyses is often complicated by diversity in variables across available datasets. Therefore, recoding original variables is often necessary to build a pooled dataset. We aimed to quantify how much information is lost in this process and to what extent this jeopardizes validity of analyses results. Methods Data were derived from a platform that was developed to pool data from three randomized controlled trials on the effect of treatment of cardiovascular risk factors on cognitive decline or dementia. We quantified loss of information using the R-squared of linear regression models with pooled variables as a function of their original variable(s). In case the R-squared was below 0.8, we additionally explored the potential impact of loss of information for future analyses. We did this second step by comparing whether the Beta coefficient of the predictor differed more than 10% when adding original or recoded variables as a confounder in a linear regression model. In a simulation we randomly sampled numbers, recoded those < = 1000 to 0 and those >1000 to 1 and varied the range of the continuous variable, the ratio of recoded zeroes to recoded ones, or both, and again extracted the R-squared from linear models to quantify information loss. Results The R-squared was below 0.8 for 8 out of 91 recoded variables. In 4 cases this had a substantial impact on the regression models, particularly when a continuous variable was recoded into a discrete variable. Our simulation showed that the least information is lost when the ratio of recoded zeroes to ones is 1:1. Conclusions Large, pooled datasets provide great opportunities, justifying the efforts for data harmonization. Still, caution is warranted when using recoded variables which variance is explained limitedly by their original variables as this may jeopardize the validity of study results."
https://openalex.org/W3025754088,"Fish populations globally are susceptible to endangerment through exploitation and habitat loss. We present theoretical simulations to explore how reduced adult survival (age truncation) might affect short-lived freshwater fish species in human-altered contemporary environments. Our simulations evaluate two hypothetical ""average fish"" and five example fish species of age 1 or age 2 maturity. From a population equilibrium baseline representing a natural, unaltered environment we impose systematic reductions in adult survival and quantify how age truncation affects the causes of variation in population growth rate. We estimate the relative contributions to population growth rate arising from simulated temporal variation in age-specific vital rates and population structure. At equilibrium and irrespective of example species, population structure (first adult age class) and survival probability of the first two adult age classes are the most important determinants of population growth. As adult survival decreases, the first reproductive age class becomes increasingly important to variation in population growth. All simulated examples show the same general pattern of change with age truncation as known for exploited, longer-lived fish species in marine and freshwater environments. This implies age truncation is a general potential concern for fish biodiversity across life history strategies and ecosystems. Managers of short-lived, freshwater fishes in contemporary environments often focus on supporting reproduction to ensure population persistence. However, a strong focus on water management to support reproduction may reduce adult survival. Sustainability management needs a focus on mitigating adult mortality in human-altered ecosystems. A watershed spatial extent embracing land and water uses may be necessary to identify and mitigate causes of age truncation in freshwater species. Achieving higher adult survival will require paradigm transformations in society and government about water management priorities."
https://openalex.org/W3024669454,"Since meshes of poor quality give rise to low accuracy in finite element analysis and kinds of inconveniences in many other applications, mesh smoothing is widely used as an essential technique for the improvement of mesh quality. With respect to this issue, the main contribution of this paper is that a novel mesh smoothing method based on an exterior-angle-split process is proposed. The proposed method contains three main stages: the first stage is independent element geometric transformation performed by exterior-angle-split operations, treating elements unconnected; the second stage is to offset scaling and displacement induced by element transformation; the third stage is to determine the final positions of nodes with a weighted strategy. Theoretical proof describes the regularity of this method and many numerical experiments illustrate its convergence. Not only is this method applicable for triangular mesh, but also can be naturally extended to arbitrary polygonal surface mesh. Quality improvements of demonstrations on triangular and quadrilateral meshes show the effectiveness of this method."

To effectively address this, health systems must be well strengthened to deliver an effective continuum of care. This paper examines health systems issues and services in relation to nutritional support to children under five years, in order to identify gaps and propose interventions towards universal coverage of essential nutrition services.This analysis utilized data from a cross sectional mixed-methods study on factors associated with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) in under-five children to assess health facility nutrition services on offer at select level-one hospitals in five out of ten provinces in Zambia. Stata version 13 was used for analysis. We conducted univariate analysis to assess nutrition services offered, functionality of equipment and tools, availability of human resource and human resource development, and availability of drugs used for assessment and management of nutrition-related health outcomes.We found large variations in the level of nutrition services on offer across districts and provinces. Eighty-eight percent of all the hospitals sampled provided group nutrition counseling and 92% of the hospitals in our sample offered individual nutrition counseling to their clients. Overall, the existence of referral and counter-referral systems between the Community Based Volunteers and hospitals were the lowest among all services assessed at 48% and 58% respectively. We also found inadequate numbers of human resource across all cadres with an exception of nutritionists as recommended by the Ministry of Health.This study has revealed a number of gaps in the health system and health service delivery that requires to be addressed; most notably, a lack of tools, policies and guidelines, drugs and health specialists to help care for malnourished infants and children. Our findings also reveal inadequate referral systems between the community and health facilities in the management of severe acute malnutrition. Achieving universal coverage for nutrition services in Zambia will require a lot more attention to the health systems issues found in this study."
https://openalex.org/W3025998510,"Background The number of physician associates (PAs) training and working in the UK has increased over the last few years following the proliferation of postgraduate courses. Understanding early experiences and what impacts on engagement is important if we are to appropriately support this relatively new professional group. Methods This paper reports on a cross-sectional analysis of the first year of data from a prospective 10-year longitudinal cohort study. First year PA students (n = 89) were enrolled from five universities in one UK region where the training programmes were less than 2 years old. Data collected were: demographic information, wellbeing, burnout and engagement, expectations, placement experience, performance and caring responsibilities. Pearson’s correlations were used to examine relationships between variables and to select variables for a hierarchical regression analysis to understand which factors were associated with engagement. Descriptive statistics were calculated for questions relating to experience. Results The experiences of PA students during their first 3–6 months were mixed. For example, 78.7% of students felt that there were staff on placement they could go to for support, however, 44.8% reported that staff did not know about the role and 61.3% reported that staff did not know what clinical work they should undertake. Regression analysis found that their level of engagement was associated with their perceived career satisfaction, overall well-being, and caring responsibilities. Conclusions The support systems required for PAs may need to be examined as results showed that the PA student demographic is different to that of medical students and caring responsibilities are highly associated with engagement. A lack of understanding around the PA role in clinical settings may also need to be addressed in order to better support and develop this workforce."
