Furthermore, this study also aimed to ascertain whether the binding of ox-LDL to LOX-1 is associated with NF-κB activation. ox-LDL induced a significant dose-dependent increase in ROS production after a 30-s incubation with BAECs (p < 0.01). ROS formation was markedly reduced in BAECs incubated with anti-LOX-1 monoclonal antibody (p < 0.001), while control nonimmune IgG produced no effect. ox-LDL induced a time- and dose-dependent significant increase in ROS formation only in CHO-K1 cells stably expressing bovine LOX-1 (p < 0.001), while no increase was present in CHO-K1 cells. The activation of the transcription factor NF-κB in BAECs was evident after a 5-min incubation with ox-LDL and was attenuated by anti-LOX-1 monoclonal antibody. The conclusion is that one of the pathophysiological consequences of ox-LDL binding to LOX-1 may be the activation of NF-κB through an increased ROS production.

However, it is known that certain postsecretory modifications in the structure of lipoproteins, including the oxidative modifications of LDL can increase the expression of some adhesion molecules on endothelial cells (6.Jeng J.R.

It is not clear, however, if these effects are unspecifically related to some peroxidative products of the lipoprotein or due to a more specific mechanism. Recently, a novel receptor for ox-LDL, designated lectin-like ox-LDL receptor-1 (LOX-1) was cloned from cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) (21.Sawamura T. Kume N. Aoyama T. Moriwaki H. Hoshikawa H. Aiba Y. Tanaka T. Miwa S. Katsura Y. Kita T. Masaki T. Nature. 1997; 386: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). It has a type II membrane protein structure with a short N-terminal cytosolic domain and a long C-terminal extracellular domain but is distinct from type I and type II scavenger receptors (21.Sawamura T. Kume N. Aoyama T. Moriwaki H. Hoshikawa H. Aiba Y. Tanaka T. Miwa S. Katsura Y. Kita T. Masaki T. Nature. 1997; 386: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). Although the potential roles of this receptor in atherogenesis are not yet fully understood, it has been suggested that ox-LDL uptake through this receptor expressed on the surface of vascular endothelium may be involved in endothelial activation or dysfunction in atherogenesis (21.Sawamura T. Kume N. Aoyama T. Moriwaki H. Hoshikawa H. Aiba Y. Tanaka T. Miwa S. Katsura Y. Kita T. Masaki T. Nature. 1997; 386: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar).In this report, we investigated the effect of ox-LDL on the intracellular production of ROS in cultures of BAECs and whether the intracellular increase of ROS induced by ox-LDL is mediated by binding to a specific endothelial receptor. Furthermore, since intracellularly ROS play a major role in the translocation of NF-κB (13.Iademarco M.F. McQuillan J.J. Rosen G.D. Dean D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16323-16329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Neish A.S. Williams A.J. Palmer H.J. Whitley M.Z. Collins T. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1583-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), this study also aimed to ascertain whether the binding of ox-LDL to LOX-1 is associated with NF-κB activation.RESULTSThe exposure of 1.7 mg of LDL protein/ml of n-LDL to 5 μm Cu2+ for 18 at 37 °C resulted in a significant increase of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (12.7 ± 1.4 nmol/mg LDL protein) compared with n-LDL (0.29 ± 0.03 nmol/mg of LDL protein) (p < 0.01).The incubation of BAECs with increasing amounts of ox-LDL (50–150 μg of LDL protein/ml) for 5 min induced a dose-dependent, significant increase in DCF formation (p < 0.001), while no increase was present with n-LDL, Ac-LDL and MDA-LDL, even at the highest concentration (150 μg of LDL protein/ml). Fig.1 a shows the effect of n-LDL, Ac-LDL and MDA-LDL and of increasing amounts of ox-LDL on DCF formation in BAECs.We also performed some time course experiments of DCF formation in BAECs. As shown in Fig. 1 b, from the evaluation of the time course of DCF formation in BAECs, it was evident that the effect of ox-LDL was already present after 30 s of incubation.To test the specificity of DCF increase induced by ox-LDL in BAECs (i.e. whether or not it depended on ROS production), we preincubated BAECs with different antioxidants, known to work as radical scavengers. As shown in Fig. 2, the preincubation of BAECs with trolox, vitamin C, and probucol significantly reduced the ox-LDL-induced DCF production (p < 0.001).Figure 2Effect of preincubation of BAECs with trolox, vitamin C, and probucol on ox-LDL-induced DCF formation. BAECs were preincubated with DCFH-DA, a dye that allows the monitoring of intracellular reactive oxygen species production by flow cytometry evaluation of DCF for 45 min at 37 °C. Trolox, vitamin C, and probucol (all at a concentration of 5 μm) were also preincubated with BAECs for 30 min at 37 °C. Thereafter, ox-LDL (50 μg of LDL protein/ml) was added for 5 min at 37 °C.

In our experimental conditions, ox-LDL triggered a strong and dose-dependent production of H2O2 after a 5-min incubation. With 50 μg of LDL protein/ml of ox-LDL the mean value of H2O2 was 1.2 ± 0.3 nmol/106cells. An almost identical response was seen for the production of O⨪2 with mean values of 5.6 ± 0.4 nmol/106cells for 50 μg of LDL protein/ml of ox-LDL.In order to ascertain whether the effect of ox-LDL on DCF formation was mediated through the binding of the lipoprotein to a specific receptor on BAECs, binding tests with labeled ox-LDL were performed in BAECs and BLOX-1-CHO cells. The dose-response relationship in di-15-ASP-labeled ox-LDL binding to BAECs and BLOX-1-CHO cells showed saturation kinetics, and a 100-fold excess of unlabeled ox-LDL completely inhibited di-15-ASP-labeled ox-LDL binding to BAECs and BLOX-1-CHO cells (data not shown). Scatchard analysis revealed that di-15-ASP-labeled ox-LDL can bind to BAECs and BLOX-1-CHO cells with a constant dissociation ranging from 29 to 41 μg/ml.To further characterize the binding properties of the receptor, the receptor activity was measured in presence of various inhibitors. Ox-LDL, anti-LOX-1 mAb, and poly I significantly reduced di-15-ASP-labeled ox-LDL binding to BAECs and BLOX-1-CHO cells (p < 0.001); on the contrary, n-LDL, Ac-LDL, class A scavenger receptor inhibitor fucoidin, and control IgG did not affect di-15-ASP-labeled ox-LDL binding to BAECs and BLOX-1-CHO cells (data not shown).

BAECs and BLOX-1-CHO cells grown to confluence in 24-well plates were incubated with 6.25 μg of LDL protein/ml of di-15-ASP-labeled ox-LDL at 4 °C for 2 h in the presence of various inhibitors. Ox-LDL (100-fold excess amount), anti-LOX-1 mAb (30 μg/ml), and poly I (250 μg/ml) were used as inhibitors. After a 2-h incubation, the binding of di-15-ASP-labeled ox-LDL to BAECs and BLOX-1-CHO cells was measured in flow cytometry.

As shown in Fig. 4, the DCF formation was markedly reduced in BAECs incubated with anti-LOX-1 mAb (p < 0.001), while control IgG produced no effect. ox-LDL induced a dose- and time-dependent significant increase in DCF formation only in BLOX-1-CHO cells (p< 0.001), while no increase was present in CHO-K1 cells (Fig.5, a and b). Similarly to BAECs, n-LDL, MDA-LDL, and Ac-LDL had no effect on DCF production in BLOX-1-CHO cells.Figure 4Effect of preincubation of BAECs with anti-LOX-1 mAb on ox-LDL-induced DCF formation.

In order to ascertain a causal relationship between ox-LDL-induced DCF formation and NF-κB activation, a time course study was performed. In our experimental conditions, the activation of NF-κB showed a kinetic profile similar to DCF formation, with evident activation starting from 5 min of incubation (Fig.7). Furthermore, the effect of anti-LOX-1 mAb on ox-LDL-induced NF-κB activation was also investigated. As shown in Fig. 7, the activation of NF-κB was attenuated in BAECs incubated with anti-LOX-1 mAb.Figure 7EMSA showing the effect of ox-LDL and of preincubation with anti-LOX-1 mAb on NF-κB activation in BAECs. Nuclear extracts from BAECs treated for the indicated periods of time with 100 μg of LDL protein/ml and with anti-LOX-1 mAb (30 μg/ml) were prepared and analyzed by EMSA as described under “Materials and Methods.” As a positive control, nuclear extracts of BAECs treated with human recombinant TNF-α (2 ng/ml) for 5 min were also prepared and analyzed by EMSA. Supershift assay was performed with affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies to NF-κB p65 and p50. The specificity of the NF-κB band was demonstrated by treating the nuclear protein of positive control extracts with an excess of cold competitor probe.

We found that ox-LDL is a strong inducer of intracellular ROS production by two distinct approaches. First, ox-LDL was shown to increase the intracellular oxidation of the dye DCFH, a process that has already been demonstrated to depend on the intracellular production of ROS (33.Zulueta J.J. Sawhney R. Feng S.Y. Cote C.C. Hassoun P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L897-L902Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Cominacini L. Garbin U. Fratta Pasini A. Davoli A. Campagnola M. Pastorino A.M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27136-27142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Second, an increased H2O2 and O⨪2 production was directly measured in culture supernatants of BAECs. The increased intracellular production of ROS was prevented by preincubating BAECs with different antioxidants, known to work as radical scavengers. These data support the conclusion that the incubation of ox-LDL with BAECs is associated with an increased intracellular production of ROS and that the rise in DCF formation is specifically related to ROS formation. Our results agree with the conclusions of a series of papers showing that ox-LDL increased the production of ROS in different cells (18.Tsao P.S. Buitrago R. Chan J.R. Cooke J.P. Circulation. 1996; 94: 1682-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 19.Maeba R. Maruyama A. Tarutani O. Ueta N. Shimasaki H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 20.Kimura H. Minakami H. Kimura S. Sakurai T. Nakamura T. Kurashige S. Nakano M. Shoji A. Atherosclerosis. 1995; 118: 1-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 37.Cominacini L. Garbin U. Fratta Pasini A. Davoli A. Campagnola M. Pastorino A.M. Gaviraghi G. Lo Cascio V. J. Hypertens. 1998; 16: 1913-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).The peculiarity of this study stems from the fact that the increase in intracellular ROS formation induced by ox-LDL in BAECs was very fast, the signal of ROS production being clearly visible even after 30 s. This suggests that intracellular ROS increase may be secondary to ox-LDL ligation to a specific receptor on BAECs. Based on this evidence, we first characterized the binding of ox-LDL to BAECs and to BLOX-1-CHO cells. We found that ox-LDL bound to BAECs and to BLOX-1-CHO cells with a constant dissociation similar to that reported by Sawamuraet al. (21.Sawamura T. Kume N. Aoyama T. Moriwaki H. Hoshikawa H. Aiba Y. Tanaka T. Miwa S. Katsura Y. Kita T. Masaki T. Nature. 1997; 386: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar) and Moriwaki et al. (41.Moriwaki H. Kume N. Sawamura T. Aoyama T. Hoshikawa H. Ochi H. Nishi E. Masaki T. Kita T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1541-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as previously reported, the pretreatment of cells with an excess amount of ox-LDL, poly I, and anti-LOX-1 mAb consistently reduced the binding to BAECs and to BLOX-1-CHO cells (21.Sawamura T. Kume N. Aoyama T. Moriwaki H. Hoshikawa H. Aiba Y. Tanaka T. Miwa S. Katsura Y. Kita T. Masaki T. Nature. 1997; 386: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar, 41.Moriwaki H. Kume N. Sawamura T. Aoyama T. Hoshikawa H. Ochi H. Nishi E. Masaki T. Kita T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1541-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). On the contrary, no effect was obtained with fucoidin, a class A scavenger receptor inhibitor, n-LDL, and Ac-LDL (21.Sawamura T. Kume N. Aoyama T. Moriwaki H. Hoshikawa H. Aiba Y. Tanaka T. Miwa S. Katsura Y. Kita T. Masaki T. Nature. 1997; 386: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar, 41.Moriwaki H. Kume N. Sawamura T. Aoyama T. Hoshikawa H. Ochi H. Nishi E. Masaki T. Kita T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1541-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Observed together, these results clearly indicate that the molecular mechanisms of ox-LDL binding to LOX-1 are distinct from those of scavenger receptors, such as CD36 and SR-B1 (41.Moriwaki H. Kume N. Sawamura T. Aoyama T. Hoshikawa H. Ochi H. Nishi E. Masaki T. Kita T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1541-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The fact that DCF formation was markedly reduced in BAECs preincubated with anti-LOX-1 mAb, indicates that the ox-LDL ligation to LOX-1 may play a role in intracellular ROS generation. This conclusion is further supported by the results we obtained with BLOX-1-CHO cells where ox-LDL determined a time- and dose-dependent significant increase in DCF formation that could be abolished by anti-LOX-1 mAb preincubation.There are many enzymatic sources for ROS in almost all cell types (42.Lander H.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that the activity or expression of these enzymes can be regulated by cytokines and growth factors (42.Lander H.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Thus, receptor-ligand interaction is likely to trigger free radical signaling through activation of one or more of these enzymes (42.Lander H.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). In fact, several reports have indicated an increase in ROS upon receptor ligation (43.Ohba M. Shibanuma M. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 44.Griendling K.K. Minieri C.A. Ollerenshaw J.D. Alexander R.W. Circ.

Chan C.K. Gristein S. Downey G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17131-17137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, on the basis of the present results, we cannot draw any conclusion on this particular point, and further studies are needed to confirm that ox-LDL ligation to LOX-1 may affect the triggering of free radicals through the activation of some ROS sources.Finally, the results of this study show that ox-LDL induced NF-κB activation in BAECs. Numerous studies have provided strong support for a proposal that intracellular ROS serve as common intracellular downstream messengers of the various stimulus-specific pathways leading to NF-κB activation (14.Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3395) Google Scholar, 49.Schreck R. Meier B. Mannel D.M. Droge W. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp.

Thromb. 1994; 14: 1665-1673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the potent antioxidants pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate andN-acetylcysteine block NF-κB activation (49.Schreck R. Meier B. Mannel D.M. Droge W. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar, 50.Weber C. Erl W. Pietsch A. Strobel M. Loms Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Weber P.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1665-1673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), not only by H2O2 and ionizing radiation, but also by nonoxidizing stimuli (50.Weber C. Erl W. Pietsch A. Strobel M. Loms Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Weber P.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1665-1673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of NF-κB by H2O2 and other stimuli can be suppressed by herbimycin A and tryphostin 47 (51.Smith W.L. Marnett L.J. De Witt D.L. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 49: 153-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of a redox-sensitive protein-tyrosine kinase in the activation process. We recently found that ox-LDL and TNF-α increased the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells through NF-κB activation (8.Cominacini L. Garbin U. Fratta Pasini A. Davoli A. Campagnola M. Contessi G.B. Pastorino A.M. Lo Cascio V. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar,17.Cominacini L. Garbin U. Fratta Pasini A. Paulon T.

Hypertension. 1997; 15: 1633-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and that this stimulus was inhibited by the presence of compounds with radical scavenging activity (8.Cominacini L. Garbin U. Fratta Pasini A. Davoli A. Campagnola M. Contessi G.B. Pastorino A.M. Lo Cascio V. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 17.Cominacini L.

Based on the results of the present study, we propose that ox-LDL-receptor interaction could have triggered free radical signaling through activation of one or more of the many enzymatic sources for ROS that are present in almost all cell types (42.Lander H.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar) and that these free radicals may play a key role in the cellular pathways leading to NF-κB activation. One criterion for a causal relationship between NF-κB activation and ROS production in response to ox-LDL is a kinetic coincidence of the two events. BAECs showed an approximately 30-s delay before 50 μg of LDL protein/ml of ox-LDL could induce ROS production. NF-κB activity did not strongly increase before 5 min after the addition of 50 μg of LDL protein/ml of ox-LDL. These data show that NF-κB activation follows the prod"
https://openalex.org/W1978047924,"Wnt ligands working through Frizzled receptors have a differential ability to stimulate release of intracellular calcium (Ca2+) and activation of protein kinase C (PKC). Since targets of this Ca2+ release could play a role in Wnt signaling, we first tested the hypothesis that Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CamKII) is activated by some Wnt and Frizzled homologs. We report that Wnt and Frizzled homologs that activate Ca2+ release and PKC also activate CamKII activity in Xenopus embryos, while Wnt and Frizzled homologs that activate β-catenin function do not. This activation occurs within 10 min after receptor activation in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner, concomitant with autophosphorylation of endogenous CamKII. Based on data that Wnt-5A and Wnt-11 are present maternally in Xenopus eggs, and activate CamKII, we then tested the hypothesis that CamKII participates in axis formation in the early embryo. Measurements of endogenous CamKII activity from dorsal and ventral regions of embryos revealed elevated activity on the prospective ventral side, which was suppressed by a dominant negative Xwnt-11. If this spatial bias in CamKII activity were involved in promoting ventral cell fate one might predict that elevating CamKII activity on the dorsal side would inhibit dorsal cell fates, while reducing CamKII activity on the ventral side would promote dorsal cell fates. Results obtained by expression of CamKII mutants were consistent with this prediction, revealing that CamKII contributes to a ventral cell fate.

Wnts are involved in diverse developmental processes, including cell differentiation, cell migration, cell polarity, and cell proliferation (reviewed in Ref. 2.Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). Unregulated activation of Wnt signaling has also been linked to a variety of human cancers (reviewed in Refs. 1.Miller J.R. Hocking A.M. Brown J.D. Moon R.T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7860-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar and 2.Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). The best understood Wnt signaling pathway is stimulated by wingless in Drosophila, and by its counterpart, Wnt-1, in vertebrates (reviewed in Refs. 1.Miller J.R. Hocking A.M. Brown J.D. Moon R.T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7860-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar and 2.Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). In this pathway, in the absence of a Wnt signal a serine-threonine kinase, glycogen synthase kinase-3, promotes the phosphorylation and degradation of β-catenin, facilitated by the adaptor proteins adenomatous polyposis coli and axin. Stimulation of the Wnt pathway activates Dishevelled, which in turn reduces the degradation of β-catenin, leading to its accumulation. Dishevelled may be regulated by two kinases, casein kinase I (3.Peters J.M. McKay R.M. McKay J.P. Graff J.M. Nature. 1999; 401: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) and casein kinase II (4.Willert K. Brink M. Wodarz A. Varmus H. Nusse R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3089-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). As β-catenin levels increase, it forms complexes with the HMG box transcription factors TCF and LEF, activating expression of target genes. Since there are likely to be at least 18 vertebrate Wnt genes (reviewed in Ref. 2.Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to ask if cells respond to expression of these Wnts in an identical manner. Ectopic expression of one group of Wnts, including Wnt-1, -3A, -8, and -8b, on the ventral side of cleaving Xenopus embryos leads to induction of a secondary body axis in Xenopus (reviewed in Ref. 5.Moon R.T. Brown J.D. Torres M. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 157-162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Many of the same Wnts are transforming in C57mg mammary epithelial cells (6.Wong G.T. Gavin B.J. McMahon A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6278-6286Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In both assays, the cellular response is attributed to the Wnts activating a signaling pathway that promotes the stabilization and activity of the multi-functional protein β-catenin (reviewed in Refs. 1.Miller J.R. Hocking A.M. Brown J.D. Moon R.T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7860-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 2.Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar, and 7.Miller J.R. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Other Wnts, including Wnt-4, -5A, and -11, do not induce formation of a secondary axis in Xenopus nor do they transform C57mg cells. Data suggest that the non axis-inducing, non-transforming Wnts are nevertheless biologically active. First, when overexpressed inXenopus embryos these Wnts are able to antagonize axis induction by the transforming Wnts and to elicit a distinct phenotype (8.Du S.J. Purcell S.M. Christian J.L. McGrew L.L. Moon R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2625-2634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Torres M.A. Yang-Snyder J.A. Purcell S.M. DeMarais A.A. McGrew L.L. Moon R.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1123-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Second, the non-transforming Wnts elicit intracellular Ca2+ release (10.Slusarski D.C. Yang-Snyder J. Busa W.B. Moon R.T. Dev. Biol. 1997; 182: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 11.Slusarski D.C. Corces V. Moon R.T. Nature. 1997; 390: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) and activate PKC (Ref. 12.Sheldahl L.C. Park M. Malbon C.C. Moon R.T. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, reviewed in Ref. 1.Miller J.R. Hocking A.M. Brown J.D. Moon R.T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7860-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). In contrast, the transforming/axis-inducing Wnts do not stimulate Ca2+ release nor do they activate PKC. Third, Wnts have been shown to signal through receptors belonging to the Frizzled gene family (reviewed Refs. 1.Miller J.R. Hocking A.M. Brown J.D. Moon R.T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7860-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar and 2.Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar), and Frizzled homologs have been shown to preferentially stimulate either β-catenin, or the activation of Ca2+ and PKC (10.Slusarski D.C. Yang-Snyder J. Busa W.B. Moon R.T. Dev. Biol. 1997; 182: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 11.Slusarski D.C. Corces V. Moon R.T. Nature. 1997; 390: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 12.Sheldahl L.C. Park M. Malbon C.C. Moon R.T. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Fourth, in the chick limb Wnt-3A works through the β-catenin pathway while Wnt-7a works through a β-catenin-independent intracellular pathway (13.Kengaku M. Capdevila J. Rodriguez-Esteban C. De La Pena J. Johnson R.L. Belmonte J.C.I. Tabin C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 1274-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Interestingly, some Wnts may couple to both pathways. For example, Wnt-5A can become axis inducing in Xenopus when co-expressed with human Frizzled-5 (14.He X. Saint-Jeannet J.P. Wang Y. Nathans J. Dawid I. Varmus H. Science. 1997; 275: 1652-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). One could interpret these data to conclude that Wnt-5A is not axis inducing in the absence of Frizzled-5 because there is no Wnt-5A receptor present. However, the demonstrated ability of Wnt-5A to antagonize axis induction by Wnt-8 (9.Torres M.A. Yang-Snyder J.A. Purcell S.M. DeMarais A.A. McGrew L.L. Moon R.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1123-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), to stimulate Ca2+ release (10.Slusarski D.C. Yang-Snyder J. Busa W.B. Moon R.T. Dev. Biol. 1997; 182: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 11.Slusarski D.C. Corces V. Moon R.T. Nature. 1997; 390: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar), and to stimulate PKC activation (12.Sheldahl L.C. Park M. Malbon C.C. Moon R.T. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) suggests that Wnt-5A can elicit distinct cellular responses, depending on which receptors are present. Overall, the data suggest that cells and embryos display diversity in their responses to signaling by different Wnt and Frizzled homologs. As mentioned above the protein kinases glycogen synthase kinase-3, casein kinase I, and casein kinase II, have been implicated in modulating the Wnt-1 pathway. Given the evidence that some Wnt and Frizzled homologs stimulate intracellular Ca2+ release and PKC activation, this raises the possibility that other Ca2+-sensitive kinases might be activated by Wnt and Frizzled homologs. One candidate kinase is CamKII,1 a ubiquitous Ca2+-sensitive enzyme that has been proposed to function in very distinct contexts, including mammalian oocyte maturation, neurotransmitter synthesis and release, and long term potentiation (15.Lorca T. Cruzalegui F.H. Fesquet D. Cavadore J.C. Mery J. Means A. Doree M. Nature. 1993; 366: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 16.Fukunaga K. Stoppini L. Miyamoto E. Muller D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7863-7867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Braun A.P. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 417-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). After activation by Ca2+/calmodulin, CamKII becomes autophosphorylated and shows an autonomous, Ca2+independent activity. Thus, measuring Ca2+-independent CamKII activities in the absence of exogenous calcium allows the determination of the activity of endogenous CamKII just prior to lysis. As CamKII is activated by the phosphatidylinositol pathway in PC 12 cells (18.MacNicol M. Jefferson A.B. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18055-18058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and as Xwnt-5A and rat Frizzled-2 (Rfz-2) elevate intracellular Ca2+ levels through activation of the phosphatidylinositol pathway (10.Slusarski D.C. Yang-Snyder J. Busa W.B. Moon R.T. Dev. Biol. 1997; 182: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 11.Slusarski D.C. Corces V. Moon R.T. Nature. 1997; 390: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar), in the present report we first investigate whether different members of the Wnt and Frizzled gene families activate CamKII. We then test whether CamKII displays dorso-ventral differences in activity in the Xenopus embryo, whether these asymmetries are dependent upon Wnt signaling, and whether CamKII participates in specification of cell fate in the early embryo. Rat brain α-CamKII constructs (19.Waldmann R. Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1679-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 20.Hanson P.I. Meyer T. Stryer L. Schulman H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 943-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) and all other constructs used for RNA injection were subcloned into the vector pCS2+ allowingin vitro transcription of mRNA with SP6 mMESSAGE mMACHINE Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Amounts of RNA injected were as indicated in the text or figure legends. Whole mount in situhybridization for marker gene expression was performed as described (9.Torres M.A. Yang-Snyder J.A. Purcell S.M. DeMarais A.A. McGrew L.L. Moon R.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1123-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The C-terminal truncated version of CamKII K42M (CamKII K42M 1–271) was generated by polymerase chain reaction using Pfu Polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and verified by sequencing. For UV irradiation, embryos were exposed 20 min after fertilization to 254 nm UV light for various times and injected at 1- or 4-cell stages. Mono- and polyclonal antibodies against CamKII were from Signal Transduction (Lexington, KY). The antibody recognizing the Thr286-phosphorylated form of CamKII was from Promega (Madison, WI). Immunoprecipitations and Western blotting were performed as described (21.Finnemann S. Kühl M. Otto G. Wedlich D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5082-5091Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Autoradiographs were scanned and analyzed using NIH Image 1.6.1 software. Injected embryos were cultured until stage 7. Embryos were washed in Ca2+-free medium five times prior to lysis. Thirty embryos were lysed in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 40 μm EGTA, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm okadaic acid, and 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. Lysates were cleared twice in a microcentrifuge and subsequently assayed for kinase activity. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The activity of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase was determined using Syntide-2 as a substrate (22.Hashimoto Y. Soderling T.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 252: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) in a final volume of 50 μl. Autonomous, calcium independent activity was determined in the presence of 200 μm EGTA, while total activity was measured in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2. Reactions were started by adding 5 μl of embryo extract, and 5-μl samples were spotted in 10-s intervals onto phosphocellulose and processed as described previously (23.Witt J.J. Roskoski R. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 66: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Samples were processed in duplicates for each condition and embryo batch and enzyme activities were expressed in picomole × min−1 × mg−1 protein. Under these conditions reactions were linear for at least 3 min. The selectivity of the assay was determined using inhibitors and concentrations specific for cyclic AMP-dependent kinase (PKI 5-22, 25 nm) (24.Cheng H.C. Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Smith A.J. Misconi L. van Patten S.M. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 989-992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), protein kinase C (GF 109203X, 100 nm) (25.Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and CamKII (autocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide, 1 μm, and [Ala286]Ca2+/calmodulin kinase II inhibitor (281–301), 20 μm) (26.Ishida A. Kameshita I. Okuno S. Kitani T. Fujisawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 806-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). CamKII-specific phosphorylation of Syntide-2 is defined as that phosphorylation which could be blocked by either of the two known CamKII-specific inhibitors. Initial experiments revealed that both inhibitors yielded the same results. Since previous work has shown that autocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide is specific for CamKII at the concentrations used here, most of the data shown here were obtained by using autocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide as a CamKII inhibitor. Data analysis was performed using Cricket Graph III Software (Computer Associates International, Inc., Islandia, NY). For antagonist or agonist treatment of Fz/β2-AR chimera injected cells, animal halves of injected embryos were cut at stage 7 and dissociated in Ca2+/Mg2+-free 0.1 modified Barth's solution with 2 mm EDTA. Before the assay, cells were treated for 5 min in 100 μm propranolol as antagonist to reduce basal activity. For drug treatment cells were exposed to agonist (isoproterenol, 100 μm) or antagonist (propranolol, 100 μm) for 10 min and assayed for CamKII activity after lysis in the same buffer as mentioned above. Similar results were obtained by treatment of undissociated, whole animal cap explants after 30 min of treatment (data not shown). PKC translocation assays were performed as described (12.Sheldahl L.C. Park M. Malbon C.C. Moon R.T. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that some Wnt and Frizzled homologs stimulate CamKII, we injected RNAs encoding various Wnt and Frizzled homologs intoXenopus embryos. We then monitored endogenous CamKII activity in extracts of injected embryos using a peptide substrate, Syntide-2 (22.Hashimoto Y. Soderling T.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 252: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), in the absence of exogenous Ca2+. Consistent with the possibility that Wnt and Frizzled homologs that stimulate Ca2+ release (10.Slusarski D.C. Yang-Snyder J. Busa W.B. Moon R.T. Dev. Biol. 1997; 182: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 11.Slusarski D.C. Corces V. Moon R.T. Nature. 1997; 390: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) might also activate CamKII, Xwnt-5A (39 pmol × mg−1 × min−1, S.E. = 5 with p < 0.01 in Student's t test), and Rfz-2 (30 pmol × mg−1 × min−1, S.E. = 3 with p < 0.05 in Student's ttest) induced CamKII activity approximately 3-fold over control embryos injected with prolactin RNA (12 pmol × mg−1 × min−1, S.E. = 0.2) (Fig.1 A). Importantly, Xwnt-8 and Rfz-1, which signal through a β-catenin-dependent Wnt signaling pathway (27.Yang-Snyder J. Miller J. Brown J.D. Lai C.J. Moon R.T. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1302-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) and not through intracellular release of Ca2+ (10.Slusarski D.C. Yang-Snyder J. Busa W.B. Moon R.T. Dev. Biol. 1997; 182: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 11.Slusarski D.C. Corces V. Moon R.T. Nature. 1997; 390: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar), did not stimulate CamKII activity (Fig.1 A). Xwnt-11, which acts like Xwnt-5A in early embryos (9.Torres M.A. Yang-Snyder J.A. Purcell S.M. DeMarais A.A. McGrew L.L. Moon R.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1123-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), resembles Xwnt-5A in its ability to induce CamKII (42 pmol × mg−1 × min−1, S.E. = 3 withp < 0.01 in Student's t test) (Fig.1 A). The differences in the ability of Xwnt-5A and Xwnt-8 to induce CamKII were independent of Wnt protein level, as monitored by Western blot analysis of epitope-tagged Wnts (inset, Fig.1 B). We conclude that some Wnt and Frizzled homologs known to induce intracellular Ca2+ release and to activate PKC also induce CamKII activity, whereas some Wnt and Frizzled homologs that signal through β-catenin do not. We then analyzed the activities of murine Frizzled to determine if activation of CamKII is a general feature of Frizzled signaling. Murine homologs were used rather than Xenopus homologs since data on the signaling activities of the former are better described (12.Sheldahl L.C. Park M. Malbon C.C. Moon R.T. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Three members of the Frizzled family, Mfz-3, Mfz-4, and Mfz-6, have recently been shown to activate PKC (12.Sheldahl L.C. Park M. Malbon C.C. Moon R.T. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) and we observe that they also activate CamKII (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, MFz-7 and MFz-8 activate the β-catenin pathway as monitored by expression of the target gene Xnr-3 (12.Sheldahl L.C. Park M. Malbon C.C. Moon R.T. Curr.

Those Frizzleds activating CamKII and PKC do not induce the β-catenin target gene Xnr-3 and vice versa. The increased activity of CamKII in response to signaling by specific Wnt and Frizzled homologs could be due to an increase in enzyme activity, or to an increase in enzyme level. To distinguish between these possibilities we repeated the assay with added Ca2+to determine the total, Ca2+-dependent CamKII activity, as a measure of total enzyme level. After expression of Wnt and Frizzled homologs we found no statistically significant differences in total activity (Fig. 1 B). By dividing the CamKII activity obtained in the absence of exogenous Ca2+ (Fig.1 A) by that obtained in the presence of exogenous Ca2+ (Fig. 1 B) we calculated a specific, Ca2+ independent activity of 11% of total kinase activity in control embryos compared with 35% in Xwnt-5A injected embryos, 42% in Xwnt-11 injected embryos, or 27% in Rfz-2 injected embryos. This represents a 2.5–3.8-fold increase in the specific activity of CamKII upon expression of Rfz-2, Xwnt-5A, or Xwnt-11. Dose-response studies revealed that even 100 pg of Xwnt-5A RNA were able to induce CamKII at the same level as 1 ng indicating that maximal stimulation has been reached (see Fig. 3 A for data for 100 pg of Xwnt-5A RNA). Addition of exogenous calmodulin did not result in a further increase in total kinase activity (data not shown). Finally, we directly demonstrated by Western blot analysis that neither Xwnt-5A (Fig.1 D) nor Rfz-2 (data not shown) elevated steady-state levels of CamKII. Our data therefore suggest that the intensity of Ca2+ signaling (amplitude and/or frequency) is the limiting factor in CamKII activation in early Xenopus embryos, and that the activation of CamKII by specific Wnt and Frizzled homologs is attributable to an increase in enzyme activity rather than level. This conclusion is further supported by analysis of chimeric receptors (Fig.2, as discussed below).Figure 2Direct activation of CamKII by inducible Frizzled chimeras. Panel A, the cartoon denotes that cytoplasmic domains were derived from Frizzled homologs. Panel B, treatment of cells expressing Rfz-2/β2-AR with an agonist (isoproterenol) but not antagonist (propranolol) for 10 min induces CamKII activity in a manner blocked by pertussis toxin (Ptx). Rfz-1/β2-AR does not activate CamKII even in the presence of agonist.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) If Wnt-5A and Rfz-2 function in the same signaling pathway as ligand and receptor, one would predict that they should synergize in their induction of CamKII. To test this hypothesis we first established that a low dose of Xwnt-5A RNA (10 pg) elevated CamKII activity while a low dose of Rfz-2 (50 pg) did not (Fig. 1 C). Co-injection of these doses of Xwnt-5A and Rfz-2 RNAs revealed a synergistic activation of CamKII (Fig. 1 C), suggesting they act in the same signaling pathway. The increase of CamKII activity in Xwnt-5A/Rfz-2 injected embryos with respect to basal activity in control embryos is 2-fold higher than a simple additive activation of CamKII by either component. Since Ca2+ release by either Xwnt-5A or Rfz-2 is sensitive to treatment with pertussis toxin (11.Slusarski D.C. Corces V. Moon R.T. Nature. 1997; 390: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) and since we predict that CamKII activation is downstream of intracellular Ca2+release, we next tested the prediction that CamKII activity should be sensitive to this toxin. We co-injected RNAs encoding Xwnt-5A and pertussis toxin A protomer and observed that the ability of Xwnt-5A to stimulate CamKII activity was blocked by pertussis toxin (Fig.3 A). Thus Xwnt-5A and Rfz-2, previously shown to synergize in inducing intracellular Ca2+ release in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner (11.Slusarski D.C. Corces V. Moon R.T. Nature. 1997; 390: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar), also synergize to induce CamKII activity in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner. Previous work has shown that CamKII is autophosphorylated during activation (28.Fong Y.-L. Taylor W.L. Means A.R. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16759-16763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Kuret J. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6427-6433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If Xwnt-5A and Rfz-2 are indeed activators of CamKII then they should increase its phosphorylation. We therefore immunoprecipitated total CamKII from cytoplasmic lysates of injected embryos, blotted the immunoprecipitates, and probed with an antiserum specific for the Thr286-autophosphorylated form of CamKII. Consistent with the enzyme activity measurements, overexpression of Xwnt-5A stimulates the phosphorylation of CamKII (Fig. 1 D). When the same blot was stripped and reprobed for total CamKII, comparable levels were observed (Fig. 1 D). After normalization to the total amount of loaded CamKII we found a 1.7-fold increase in CamKII phosphorylation (n = 3 experiments, S.E. = 0.15) upon injection of Xwnt-5A RNA in comparison to embryos injected with prolactin or Xwnt-8 RNAs. Similarly, Rfz-2 revealed a slight increase (1.3-fold increase, n = 2 experiments, S.E. = 0.04, data not shown) in phosphorylation of CamKII, whereas Rfz-1 did not. The relative increase in CamKII phosphorylation upon injection of Xwnt-5A or Rfz-2 RNA thus independently supports the kinase assays, and the conclusion that these Wnt and Frizzled homologs stimulate CamKII activity. In order to test whether the observed activation of CamKII by a subset of Wnt and Frizzled homologs is a rapid response to receptor activation, or a belated physiological reflection of this activation, we used inducible Frizzled/β2-AR chimeras (30.Liu X. Liu T. Slusarski D.C. Yang-Snyder J. Malbon C.C. Moon R.T. Wang H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14383-14388Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This circumvented the need for purified active Wnts. These chimeras consist of the extracellular and transmembrane regions of the hamster β2-AR and the intracellular domains of either Rfz-2 or Rfz-1 (Fig. 2 A). We observed that Xenopus embryo cells expressing Rfz-2/β2-AR and treated with the agonist isoproterenol displayed activation of CamKII within 10 min (Fig. 2 B), without substantially greater activation at 30 min (data not shown). In contrast, treatment with the antagonist propranolol did not induce CamKII. The agonist-dependent activation was attributable to Rfz-2 and not other domains of the chimeric receptor since the Rfz-1/β2-AR chimera did not activate CamKII (Fig.2 B). As observed with native Rfz-2, the activation of CamKII by the RFz-2/β2-AR chimera upon treatment with agonist was sensitive to pertussis toxin (Fig. 2 B). We conclude that activation of CamKII by Rfz-2 occurs within minutes of receptor activation, and is d"

Vesicles may contribute to bacterial pathogenicity by serving as vehicles for toxins to encounter host cells. Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) vesicles were isolated from culture supernatants and purified on velocity gradients, thereby removing any soluble proteins and contaminants from the crude preparation. Vesicle protein profiles were similar but not identical to outer membranes and differed between strains. Most vesicle proteins were resistant to dissociation, suggesting they were integral or internal. Thin layer chromatography revealed that major outer membrane lipid components are present in vesicles. Cytoplasmic membranes and cytosol were absent in vesicles; however, alkaline phosphatase and AcrA, periplasmic residents, were localized to vesicles. In addition, physiologically active heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) was associated with ETEC vesicles. LT activity correlated directly with the gradient peak of vesicles, suggesting specific association, but could be removed from vesicles under dissociating conditions. Further analysis revealed that LT is enriched in vesicles and is located both inside and on the exterior of vesicles. The distinct protein composition of ETEC vesicles and their ability to carry toxin may contribute to the pathogenicity of ETEC strains."

The annexin II light chain (p11), one of the two subunits of the annexin II tetramer, was one of the proteins identified. We have confirmed that recombinant human procathepsin B interacts with p11 as well as with the annexin II tetramer in vitro. Furthermore, procathepsin B could interact with the annexin II tetramer in vivo as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation. Cathepsin B and the annexin II tetramer were shown by immunofluorescent staining to colocalize on the surface of human breast carcinoma and glioma cells. Taken together, our results indicate that the annexin II tetramer can serve as a binding protein for procathepsin B on the surface of tumor cells, an interaction that may facilitate tumor invasion and metastasis."

Thus, an understanding of the biological function(s) of the flavoHbs demands a greater knowledge of their various activities. In this report, steady-state, reduction, and ligand binding kinetics of the E. coli NOD (flavoHb) were measured in order to define its function and the mechanism of NO dioxygenation. We also examined the effects of amino acid substitutions at the highly conserved Tyr(B10) position on NOD activity, reduction, and ligand binding kinetics (7.Ermler U. Siddiqui R.A. Cramm R.

For larger preparations from 12-liter cultures, pooled Superdex 75 fractions were separated again on the DEAE-Sepharose as described above. FlavoHb fractions were concentrated and stored at 70 °C. FlavoHb yields were typically 2–5 mg/liter of culture. Sample purity was estimated from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For the wild-type and Phe(B10) substitution, purity was judged to be 95%, and for the B10 Glu and His mutants, purity was estimated at 80%. Where indicated, reconstitution with heme was achieved by incubating flavoHb with stoichiometric excesses of heme, dithiothreitol, and dithionite, and reactants were separated from flavoHb on a Sephadex G25 column in N2-purged buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and 1 mmEDTA.

FlavoHbs were routinely diluted in buffer A containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and kept on ice. Dithiothreitol was included to stabilize flavoHb and had no effect on NO decomposition rates at the carry-over concentrations of <5 μm. Rates of whole cell NO consumption were measured with 1 μm NO at 37 °C unless specified otherwise (13.Gardner P.R. Gardner A.M. Martin L.A. Salzman A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10378-10383Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 14.Gardner P.R. Costantino G. Salzman A.L. J. Biol.

O2 concentration was varied by first scrubbing the reaction mixture with N2 and then adding O2 from a saturated O2 solution. NO consumption rates were corrected for background rates of NO decomposition for each assay condition. NADH oxidase activity was followed at 340 nm in a 0.5-ml reaction containing 100 μm NADH, and 1 μm FAD in buffer A at 37 °C. NO reductase activity was measured amperometrically in an anaerobic 2-ml reaction at 37 °C containing buffer A, 1 μm FAD, 10 mm glucose, 16 units of glucose oxidase, 260 units of catalase, 100 μm NADH, and 5 μm NO. NO and flavoHb were added following O2 depletion, and NO decomposition rates were determined with 1 μm NO. FAD reductase activity was assayed at 450 nm in a 1-ml reaction as described for the measurement of NO reductase activity except that 20 μm FAD was included and NO was omitted. Heme was measured using the alkaline pyridine method (29.Appleby C.A. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). FAD was assayed using fluorescence at 520 nm with excitation at 460 nm following a 3-min incubation of flavoHb at 100 °C (30.Ioannidis N. Cooper C.E. Poole R.K. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). E = 6,220m−1 cm−1 at 340 nm was used for the measurement of NAD(P)H. Protein was assayed using the dye-binding assay (31.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) with a bovine serum albumin standard. All reactions were carried out in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 0.3 mmEDTA at pH 7.0, and 20 °C. FlavoHbs were exposed to air on ice to allow complete oxidation as monitored at 404 nm. Vials containing flavoHbs were sealed and flushed with N2 for 10–20 min with gentle agitation to remove O2. An aliquot was removed with a syringe and diluted into anaerobic buffer. The resultant sample (3–4 μm heme) was injected in a Gibson-Dionex stainless steel stopped-flow apparatus and rapidly mixed with anaerobic buffer containing various amounts of NADH. The system was presoaked with concentrated deoxyhemoglobin to remove any residual O2. FAD reduction was followed at 460 nm, and heme iron reduction was monitored at 430 nm. O2, CO, and NO association rate constants ( k′O2,k′CO, and k′NO) were determined by measuring the time courses for ligand rebinding after laser photolysis of the corresponding complexes using a 300-ns excitation pulse at 577 nm (32.Rohlfs R.J. Mathews A.J. Carver T.E. Olson J.S. Springer B.A. Egeberg K.D. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3168-3176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Solutions of the ferrous complexes contained ∼30–50 μm flavoHb and 300–600 μm NADH. Rebinding to flavoHb-Fe2+ was followed at either 430 nm (O2) or 436 nm (NO and CO). NO rebinding to flavoHb-Fe3+ was monitored at 419 nm in the absence of any reducing agent. To prepare flavoHb-Fe2+-O2 complexes, NADH was added to buffer equilibrated with various N2/O2 gas mixtures in a sealed 1-mm cuvette. FlavoHbs were injected into the cuvette, shaken, and immediately photolyzed. Time courses were recorded within 2 min of flavoHb injection, since the NADH oxidase activity of flavoHb rapidly depletes O2 and NADH at such high μm flavoHb concentrations, and soon either flavoHb-Fe2+ or flavoHb-Fe3+ is generated, depending upon which substrate is present in excess. Rate constants for O2 dissociation ( kO2) were determined by stopped-flow rapid mixing techniques using the CO displacement method (32.Rohlfs R.J. Mathews A.J. Carver T.E. Olson J.S. Springer B.A. Egeberg K.D. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3168-3176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Solutions of flavoHb-Fe2+-O2 were mixed with CO-saturated buffer, and the displacement reaction was followed at 422 nm. The observed displacement rate (r obs) is equal to kO2/(1 + k′O2[O2]/k′CO[CO]). kO2 was calculated from this expression using k′O2 andk′CO determined as described above. CO dissociation rate constants (k CO) were determined by displacing bound CO with high concentrations of NO. Reduced flavoHb-Fe2+ incubated with 100 μm CO was mixed with buffer equilibrated with 1 atmosphere of NO (2 mm). The rate constants for NO dissociation (k NO) from flavoHb-Fe2+ were measured by injecting flavoHb-Fe2+-NO complex into a solution containing 10 mm dithionite and 1 mmCO, and the time course of flavoHb-Fe2+-CO formation was monitored at 422 nm (33.Moore E.G. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2788-2794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant sperm whale Mb was used as the standard and control for all measurements. The following reactions and rate constants describe the transient and steady-state kinetics for NO dioxygenation by flavoHb.E(0)⇀kH′[NADH] E(2)⇀kET E′(2)E′(2)⇌kO2kO2′[O2] E′(2)­O2 ⇀kOX′[NO] E(1)­Pkp⇀kPE(1)+PE(1)⇀kET E′(1)Equation 2 E′(1 )⇌kO2kO2′[O2] E′(1)­O2 ⇀kOX′[NO] E(0)­P ⇀kP E(0)+PThe enzyme species, E(n), are defined byn, the number of electrons added, and a prime to indicate when the heme iron atom is reduced and capable of binding O2. Thus, the E(2) species represents flavoHb with FADH2/Fe3+, E′(2) is FADH·/Fe2+, E(1) is FADH·/Fe3+, and E′(1) is FAD/Fe2+. P refers to the product nitrate. A more detailed and complex reaction scheme is shown in Fig.10. Initial hydride transfer from NADH to FAD is assumed to be a simple bimolecular process with an apparent rate equal tok′H[NADH]. As described under “Results” (Fig. 8 A), the initial two-electron reduction of FAD probably involves rapid NADH binding followed by hydride transfer to form FADH2. However, most of the initial velocity measurements were carried out at high [NADH], where the reduction of FAD becomes effectively a simple one-step bimolecular process defined by k′H. Electron transfer from the flavin to the iron atom is modeled as a simple, irreversible process with a rate equal tok ET. O2 binding is assumed to be reversible with association and dissociation rate constants k′O2 and kO2, respectively. The oxidative reaction of NO with flavoHbO2 is modeled as a bimolecular step with a rate equal tok′ox[NO], based on the previous work of Eichet al. (34.Eich R.F. Li T. Lemon D.D. Doherty D.H. Curry S.R. Aitken J.F. Mathews A.J. Johnson K.A. Smith R.D. Phillips G.N.J. Olson J.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6976-6983Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), and then nitrate release occurs by a first order process governed by k p. The NO dioxygenation process occurs again for the one-electron reduced enzyme. For the sake of simplicity, the rate constants for the second set of O2 binding and NO oxidation steps are assumed to be identical to those for the E(2) to E(1) oxidation. As described under “Discussion,” the rate of O2 binding depends on the fraction of reduced iron present in the intermediate, which in turn almost certainly depends on the number of electrons present in the enzyme. Thus, k′O2 may be different forE(2) versus E(1), and further experiments are needed to determine these differences. The rate of product formation or NO consumption is given by the following,vi=kP([E′ (0)P]+[E′(1)P)]=Vmax(obs)[NADH]Km(obs)+[NADH]Equation 3 and can be analyzed at fixed [NO] and [O2] in terms of a hyperbolic dependence on NADH concentration. Expressions forV max(obs, NADH) and K m(obs, NADH) can be derived by applying steady-state assumptions for the rates of change of the various enzyme intermediates. The resultant equations are as follows,Vmax(obs,NADH)=kPkETkP+kET kOX′[NO]kOX′[NO]+kPkETkP+kET [O2]kPkETkP+kETkO2′ (kO2+kOX′[NO]kOX′[NO]+kPkETkP+kET+[O2]Equation 4 Km(obs,NADH)= kPkETkP+kET2kH′ kOX′[NO]kOX′[NO]+kPkETkP+kET[O2]kPkETkP+kETkO2′ kO2+kOX′[NO]kOX′[NO]+kPkETkP+kET+[O2]Equation 5 where V max(obs, NADH) is expressed as a turnover number in units of NO heme−1 s−1 or simply s−1. These expressions and the rate constants measured in transient kinetic experiments further serve to guide our understanding of the NOD steady-state kinetics. For example, at saturating [NO] and [O2], K m(obs, NADH) = V max/2k′H, where V max =k p k ET/(k p+ k ET), and estimates of all three rate constants, k′H, k ET, andk P can be obtained in rapid mixing experiments. When initial velocity measurements are made at saturating [NADH], the steady-state expression reduces to V max(obs, NADH) or as follows.vi([NADH]→∞)Equation 6 =kPkETkP+kET kOX′[NO]kOX′[NO]+kPkETkP+kET [O2]kPkETkP+kETkO2′ (kO2+kOX′[NO])kOX′[NO]+kPkETkP+kET+[O2]At saturating [NADH] and [NO], K m(obs, O2) should approximateV max/ k′O2. In practice it is difficult to achieve this situation due to the inhibition observed at NO/O2 ratios of ≥1:100, since competition between O2 and NO for intermediatesE′(2) and E′(1) inhibits NOD activity. At saturating levels of both O2 and NADH, the initial velocity equation simplifies to the following.vi([NADH]→∞,[O2]→∞)=kPkETkP+kET [NO]kPkETkP+kETkOX′+[NO]Equation 7 This situation can be achieved experimentally without inhibition, since the ratio [NO]/[O2] can be kept at ≤1/100. Under these conditions, K m(obs, NO) equalsV max/k′ox, and the rate constant for the bimolecular reaction of NO with bound O2 can be calculated from the steady-state data. The time course for flavoHb-catalyzed NO decomposition was measured with or without FAD added as a cofactor, using purified flavoHb (∼0.1 nm) containing 0.28 mol fractions of FAD. With 10 μm NADH as reducing substrate, a linear initial rate is observed with 1 μm FAD (Fig.1 A, line 1), but in its absence, a slower initial rate is measured that rapidly declines to zero after 40 s (line 2). A 2-min preincubation of flavoHb (∼0.1 nm) at 37 °C with 10 μmNADH eliminates the initial rate in the absence, but not in the presence, of 1 μm FAD (data not shown). The FAD dependence of NOD activity following the initial ∼40-s interval of decline (Fig. 1 B) yields an apparent K dfor FAD of 40 nm (inset). With 200 μm NADPH as reducing substrate, an initial rate is not detectable without FAD (13.Gardner P.R. Gardner A.M. Martin L.A. Salzman A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10378-10383Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 14.Gardner P.R. Costantino G. Salzman A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26528-26533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and a similar K dfor FAD is estimated. The data indicate a dependence of NOD activity on added FAD. Together, these results and the substoichiometric FAD content of various E. coli flavoHb preparations (13.Gardner P.R. Gardner A.M. Martin L.A. Salzman A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10378-10383Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 30.Ioannidis N. Cooper C.E. Poole R.K. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) warranted the inclusion of FAD in flavoHb activity assays. Double reciprocal plots of initial velocity versus [NADH] at various O2 concentrations show roughly parallel lines (Fig.2 A) as predicted by the reaction mechanism described by Equation 3. At saturating levels of both NO and O2, the K m values for NADH are 4.8 and 3.2 μm at 37 and 20 °C, respectively. TheV max values are 500 and 83 NO heme−1 s−1 at 37 and 20 °C, respectively (Fig. 2 B). In comparison, the K m for NADPH at 20 °C is ∼60-fold greater, 180 μm, but theV max value is the same as that for NADH (Fig.2 C). The contribution of free O⨪2 to NO decomposition was examined, since NO reacts rapidly with free O⨪2 (k 2 ∼ 5,000 μm−1 s−1 (35.Czapski G. Goldstein S. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1995; 19: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 36.Pryor W.A. Squadrito G.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L699-L722PubMed Google Scholar)), and this reaction may interfere with measurements of NOD activity. When added in competitive excess relative to NO, superoxide dismutase (1 mg/ml) does not significantly affect the rate of NO consumption measured with 100 μm NADH and 1 μm NO. With 200 μm NADPH, a small (20 ± 8%; n = 3 ± S.D.) inhibition by superoxide dismutase is observed. The results indicate a minor or insignificant role for O⨪2 in NO decomposition by purified flavoHb and agree with previous results obtained under less optimal conditions (13.Gardner P.R. Gardner A.M. Martin L.A. Salzman A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10378-10383Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 17.Hausladen A. Gow A.J. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14100-14105Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The apparent Km for O2 is ∼100 μm when NOD is assayed with saturating NO (1 μm) and saturating levels of NADH or NADPH at 37 °C (Fig.3 A, lines 1 and2). When the concentration of NO was lowered to 0.1 μm, both V max andK m(O2) values decreased by roughly the same amount so that parallel lines are observed in the double reciprocal plot (lines 1 and 3). Under these more physiological conditions, the K m for O2is ∼35 μm at 37 °C. Similar behavior was observed at 20 °C, and the K m for O2 is ∼27 μm at high [NO] and ∼13 μm at low [NO] (Fig. 3, lines 4 and 5). In E. coli incubated at 37 °C, half-maximal NOD activity is observed at ∼60 μm O2 (Fig. 3 B), a value within range of the K m(O2) values determined for the isolated flavoHb. In the absence of O2, the NO reductase activity (23.Kim S.O. Orii Y. Lloyd D. Hughes M.N. Poole R.K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) of the flavoHb is 0.14 NO heme−1 s−1. This NO reductase activity corresponds to ∼0.02% of the NOD activity measured with saturating O2. Double reciprocal plots of NOD activity versus [NO] show normal hyperbolic kinetics at 200 μm O2 (Fig.4 A, line 1). At 50 and 25 μm O2, inhibition of NOD activity occurs at high [NO] when the NO/O2 ratio exceeds ∼1:100 (compare lines 1–3). Under noninhibiting conditions, roughly parallel lines are observed for 1/v i versus 1/[NO] at varying concentrations of O2. The dependence of the observed V max values on [O2] gives a K m for O2equal to ∼80 μm in close agreement with the results in Fig. 3. With saturating O2 (670 μm) and NADH at 37 °C, the K m value for NO is 0.28 μm (Fig. 4 B, line 1). At 20 °C with saturating O2 (260 μm) and NADH, theK m value for NO is 0.11 μm (Fig.4 B, line 2). The corresponding NOD turnover numbers (V max) at 37 and 20 °C are 670 and 94 NO heme−1 s−1, respectively. In E. coli incubated at 37 °C under normoxic conditions (200 μm O2), the apparent K mfor NO is 0.40 μm (Fig. 4 C). The role of the highly conserved flavoHb Tyr(B10) residue (7.Ermler U. Siddiqui R.A.

This pathway constitutes an antisecretory mechanism by which CCh-stimulated chloride secretion is limited. Here, we investigated mechanisms underlying CCh-stimulated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) transactivation. Thapsigargin (TG, 2 μm) stimulated EGFR and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation in T84 cells. Inhibition of either EGFR or ERK activation, with tyrphostin AG1478 (1 μm) and PD 98059 (20 μm), respectively, potentiated chloride secretory responses to TG, as measured by changes in short-circuit current (I sc) across T84 cells. CCh (100 μm) stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation and association of the Ca2+-dependent tyrosine kinase, PYK-2, with the EGFR, which was inhibited by the Ca2+ chelator, BAPTA (20 μm). The calmodulin inhibitor, fluphenazine (50 μm) inhibited CCh-stimulated PYK-2 association with the EGFR and phosphorylation of EGFR and ERK. CCh also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p60 src and association of p60 src with both PYK-2 and the EGFR. The Src family kinase inhibitor, PP2 (20 nm-20 μm) attenuated CCh-stimulated EGFR and ERK phosphorylation and potentiated chloride secretory responses to CCh. We conclude that CCh-stimulated transactivation of the EGFR is mediated by a pathway involving elevations in intracellular Ca2+, calmodulin, PYK-2, and p60 src.

Chloride secretion is, in turn, governed by a wide array of neuroimmune mediators which, when released, typically alter epithelial function by binding to specific receptors on the epithelial surface. This results in the initiation of signaling cascades and elevation of intracellular levels of second messengers, such as cyclic adenosine 5′-monophosphate (cAMP) and calcium, that promote chloride, and consequently fluid, secretion. While increased fluid secretion is important in normal intestinal physiology, pathological conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, are characterized by increased neuroimmune mediator release which may give rise to excessive chloride and fluid secretion resulting in the onset of secretory diarrhea (1.Cooke H.J. News Physiol. Sci. 1998; 13: 269-274PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Montrose M.H. Keely S.J. Barrett K.E. Yamada T. Textbook of Gastroenterology. Third Ed. Lippencott, Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia1999: 320-355Google Scholar). There is still little known of how chloride secretory responses may be limited in order to prevent excessive fluid loss from the body. In this regard, our laboratory has been investigating the role played by receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),1 and their associated signaling pathways, in limiting calcium-dependent epithelial secretion. Treatment of colonic epithelial cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF) leads to inhibition of subsequent secretory responses elicited by calcium-dependent agonists, such as carbachol (CCh) (3.Uribe J.M. Gelbmann C.M. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Barrett K.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C914-C922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an effect that is mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (4.Uribe J.M. Keely S.J. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26588-26595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the EGFR may also be recruited by calcium-dependent signaling pathways where it appears to play an intrinsic role in limiting both the extent and duration of ongoing calcium-mediated secretory responses (5.Keely S.J. Uribe J.M. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27111-27117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Thus, stimulation of colonic epithelial cells with CCh, which acts via the Gq-coupled muscarinic M3 receptor (6.O'Malley K.E. Farrell C.B. O'Boyle K. Baird A.W. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 275: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 7.Dickinson K.E. Frizzell R.A. Chandra Sekar M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 225: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), brings about transactivation of the EGFR with subsequent activation of the ERK isoforms of mitogen-activated protein kinase. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of either the EGFR or ERK results in a potentiation of CCh-stimulated secretory responses. However, the molecular mechanisms by which CCh stimulates transactivation of the EGFR in T84 cells remained to be identified. Classically two major effector pathways are activated by GqPCR agonists such as CCh: stimulation of protein kinase C (PKC) and mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. Using the sesquiterpene lactone, thapsigargin, we have previously shown that elevations in intracellular Ca2+ alone are sufficient to stimulate epithelial chloride secretion (8.Kachintorn U. Vajanaphanich M. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Dharmsathaphorn K. Barrett K.E. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 109: 510-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast, stimulation of PKC with phorbol esters has a predominantly inhibitory effect on chloride secretion (9.Kachintorn U. Vajanaphanich M. Barrett K.E. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C671-C676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, even though PKC stimulates ERK activation in T84 cells, it is unlikely to mediate the effects of CCh on EGFR and ERK activation since PKC inhibitors do not alter CCh-stimulated ERK phosphorylation (5.Keely S.J. Uribe J.M. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27111-27117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This suggests that the effects of CCh on EGFR and ERK activation are likely to be mediated by elevations in intracellular Ca2+. Indeed, studies in other models indicate that increases in intracellular calcium, whether by release of calcium from intracellular stores or by influx of extracellular calcium, stimulate increased EGFR and ERK activity (10.Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T.

Another clue as to the mechanism by which GPCR agonists bring about EGFR transactivation stems from observations that inhibition of Src family kinases attenuates GPCR-mediated EGFR and ERK phosphorylation in some systems (10.Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T.

This has led to the idea that transactivation of the EGFR may be mediated by a pathway involving elevations in intracellular calcium, PYK-2, and p60 src. However, differences between various cell types in the details of this signaling cascade prompted us to examine to what extent this scenario can be extended to our chloride secretory model in T84colonic epithelial cells. Carbachol (Sigma), tyrphostin AG1478, PD 98059, PP2, and fluphenazine (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), epidermal growth factor (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA), thapsigargin (LC Laboratories, Lexington, MA), mouse anti-human EGF receptor and mouse anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY), rabbit anti-p60 src antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), mouse anti-PYK-2 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), rabbit anti-phospho-ERK antibodies (New England Biolabs, MA), rabbit anti-phospho-PYK-2 antibodies (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA), and Tris glycine electrophoresis gels (Bio-Rad) were obtained from the sources noted. All other reagents were of analytical grade and obtained commercially. Methods for maintenance of T84cells in culture were as described previously (24.Weymer A. Huott P. Liu W. McRoberts J.A. Dharmsathaphorn K. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1828-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Briefly, T84 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 medium (JRH, Lenexa, KS) supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum. For Ussing chamber/voltage clamp experiments, approximately 5 × 105 cells were seeded onto 12-mm Millicell transwell polycarbonate filters. For immunoprecipitation/Western blotting experiments, 106 cells were seeded onto 30-mm Millicell transwell polycarbonate filters. Cells seeded onto filters were cultured for 10–15 days prior to use. When grown on polycarbonate filters, T84 cells are known to acquire the polarized phenotype of native colonic epithelia. In accordance with the known distribution of their receptors on intestinal epithelia, CCh and EGF were added basolaterally in all experiments. Thapsigargin, which exerts its effects intracellularly at the level of the endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase, was added bilaterally. Monolayers of T84cells were mounted in Ussing chambers (window area = 0.6 cm2) and bathed in oxygenated (95% O2/5% CO2) Ringers' solution at 37 °C. The composition of the Ringers' solution was (in mm): 140 Na+, 5.2 K+, 1.2 Ca2+, 0.8 Mg2+, 120 Cl−, 25 HCO3−, 2.4 H2PO4−, 0.4 HPO42−, and 10 glucose. Monolayers were voltage-clamped to zero potential difference by the application of short-circuit current (I sc). Under these conditions, changes in I sc(ΔI sc) in response to agonists are wholly reflective of electrogenic chloride secretion (25.Cartwright C.A. McRoberts J.A. Mandel K.G. Dharmsathaphorn K. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1837-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). T84cell monolayers were washed (2 times) with Ringers' solution, allowed to equilibrate for 30 min at 37 °C, and were then stimulated with agonists (± antagonists) as appropriate. The reaction was stopped by washing in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and the cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na+ vanadate, 1 mmsodium fluoride, and 1 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline) for 45 min. Cells were then scraped into microcentrifuge tubes, spun at 12,000 rpm for 10 min and the pellet was discarded. Samples were assayed for protein content (Bio-Rad protein assay kit) and adjusted so that each sample contained an equal amount of protein. For immunoprecipitation studies, lysates were incubated with immunoprecipitating antibody, as per the manufacturer's instructions, for 1 h at 4 °C followed by another 1 h incubation at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose. Lysates were then centrifuged for 3 min at 15,000 rpm and the supernatant was discarded. The pellets were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (3×) and resuspended in 2 × gel loading buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 0.2% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 1 min prior to separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Resolved proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene membranes (NEN Life Science Products Inc., Boston, MA). After transfer the membrane was preblocked with a 1% solution of blocking buffer (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) for 30 min followed by a 1-h incubation with the appropriate concentration of primary antibody in 1% blocking buffer. After washing (4 × 10 min) in Tris-buffered saline with 1% Tween (TBST), membranes were incubated for 30 min in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG; Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) in 1% blocking buffer. After washing in TBST (4 × 10 min), immunoreactive proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). Densitometric analysis of Western blots was carried out using NIH Image software. All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. for a series of n experiments. Student's ttests or analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the Student-Newman-Keuls post-test were used to compare mean values as appropriate. pvalues <0.05 were considered to represent significant differences. We first set out to determine if elevations in intracellular Ca2+ are a sufficient stimulus for EGFR and ERK phosphorylation in T84 cells. Similar to our previous studies with CCh (5.Keely S.J. Uribe J.M. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27111-27117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), treatment of T84 cells with TG (2 μm) rapidly stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR (Fig. 1 A) and both the ERK1 and ERK2 isoforms of mitogen-activated protein kinase (Fig.1 B). Furthermore, pretreatment of T84 cells with the EGFR kinase inhibitor, tyrphostin AG1478 (1 μm), partially reversed the effects of TG on ERK phosphorylation (Fig.1 C). In TG-stimulated cells ERK phosphorylation was 16.2 ± 5.4-fold over that in control, unstimulated cells compared with 6.8 ± 2.7-fold over control in tyrphostin-pretreated cells (n = 7; p < 0.05). Next, to determine if the EGFR and ERK are involved in regulation of TG-stimulated chloride secretion, we examined the effects of tyrphostin AG1478 and the ERK inhibitor, PD98059, on I scresponses to TG. Pretreatment of T84 cells with either inhibitor significantly potentiated subsequentI sc responses to TG (2 μm) (Fig.2). The maximal response to TG in tyrphostin (1 μm)-pretreated cells was 61.2 ± 9.1 μA/cm2 compared with 16.1 ± 1.6 μA/cm2 in control cells (n = 5;p < 0.005), while that in PD98059 (25 μm)-treated cells was 58.4 ± 8.5 compared with 29.5 ± 4.2 in paired controls (n = 6;p < 0.005). These data suggest that elevations in intracellular Ca2+ alone are sufficient to evoke antisecretory signaling via the EGFR and ERK in T84cells. In some cell types GPCR-mediated ERK activation is mediated by the Ca2+-dependent tyrosine kinase, PYK-2. Western blot studies employing an antibody specific for PYK-2 phosphorylated at the Y881 position revealed that CCh (100 μm) rapidly stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the enzyme in T84 cells (Fig.3 A). This was confirmed in experiments in which PYK-2 immunoprecipitates from CCh-stimulated cells were analyzed by Western blotting with antiphosphotyrosine (data not shown). Furthermore, analysis of anti-EGFR-immunoprecipitated cell lysates by Western blotting with anti-PYK-2 demonstrated that CCh also stimulates association of PYK-2 with the EGFR (Fig. 3 B). The kinetics of CCh-stimulated phosphorylation and association of PYK-2 with the EGFR were found temporally to precede those of CCh-stimulated EGFR and ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 3 C). In further experiments we sought to confirm that activation of PYK-2 occurs as a consequence of increases in intracellular Ca2+. Pretreatment of T84 cells with the intracellular Ca2+ chelator, BAPTA/AM (20μM), significantly reduced CCh-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK-2 and abolished association of the enzyme with the EGFR (Fig. 3 D). BAPTA/AM also reduced CCh-stimulated EGFR phosphorylation to 41.7 ± 8.6% of that seen in control cells (n = 5; p< 0.01). In contrast, BAPTA/AM did not inhibit EGFR phosphorylation in response to EGF itself (data not shown). Calmodulin is a signaling intermediate which commonly mediates the effects of elevations in intracellular Ca2+ in many systems. We therefore examined the possibility that this protein may also mediate transactivation of the EGFR in response to CCh. T84 cells were pretreated wit the calmodulin inhibitor, fluphenazine (FPZ; 50 μm) prior to stimulation with CCh (100 μm). As shown in Fig.4, FPZ significantly reduced association of PYK-2 with the EGFR, and phosphorylation of both the EGFR and ERK in response to CCh. FPZ also inhibited CCh-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK-2 to 47.9 ± 10.8% of that seen in controls (n = 6; p < 0.01). However, FPZ did not alter EGFR or ERK phosphorylation in response to EGF (100 ng/ml) itself (Fig. 4, inset). We next examined a potential role for p60 src in mediating CCh-stimulated EGFR and ERK activation in T84 cells. Immunoprecipitation/Western blot studies revealed that CCh (100 μm) rapidly stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of p60 src (Fig.5 A). Interestingly, we also found that CCh increased the co-immunoprecipitation of an approximately 115-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, consistent with the molecular mass of PYK-2, with p60 src. Additional experiments, in which cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-p60 src and immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-PYK-2, support the hypothesis that CCh stimulates association of PYK-2 with p60 src (Fig. 5 B). Furthermore, Western blot analysis of anti-EGFR immunoprecipitates with anti-p60 src demonstrate that CCh also stimulates association of p60 src with the EGFR in T84 cells (Fig.5 C). Next, to determine if p60 src might play a role in CCh-stimulated transactivation of the EGFR and ERK, we examined the effects of a Src family kinase inhibitor, PP2, on EGFR and ERK phosphorylation in response to CCh. Pretreatment of T84 cells with PP2 (200 nmto 20 μm) reduced both CCh-stimulated EGFR and ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 6,A-C) with the most prominent effect occurring at 20 μm. Of note, PP2 (20 μm) was without effect on either EGFR or ERK phosphorylation in response to EGF (Fig.6 D), further supporting the hypothesis that p60 src activation occurs upstream of the EGFR in response to CCh. Finally, we examined a possible role for p60 src in regulation of CCh-stimulated chloride secretion. Pretreatment of T84cells with PP2 (20 μm) significantly potentiated and prolonged subsequent I sc responses to CCh (100 μm) (Fig. 7). PeakI sc responses to CCh in control cells were 40.0 ± 5.2 μA/cm2 compared with 86.7 ± 13.6 μA/cm2 in PP2-pretreated cells (n = 6;p < 0.01). In separate experiments we found that PP2 also potentiated I sc responses to TG (2 μm). Control responses to TG were 23.3 ± 1.8 μA/cm2 compared with 90.5 ± 7.3 μA/cm2 in cells pretreated with PP2 (n = 4; p < 0.005). Significant heterogeneity exists in the signaling mechanisms employed by GPCR agonists to stimulate ERK in different cell types. GPCR-stimulated ERK activation can occur in a PKC-dependent manner (26.Dabrowski A. Groblewski G.E. Schafer C. Guan K.-U. Williams J.A. Am. J.

The predominant determinants underlying the signaling pathways employed between GPCRs and ERK activation appear to lie in the nature of receptor coupling to associated G-proteins and in the particular complement of signaling molecules expressed in different cell types (22.Wan Y. Kurosaki T. Huang X.-Y. Nature. 1996; 380: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 23.Della Rocca G.J. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol.

While it undoubtably enables GPCRs to play a role in regulation of cell growth and differentiation, there is little known of the consequences of GPCR/RTK cross-talk for acute regulation of cellular function. In this regard, we have previously demonstrated that the GqPCR agonist, CCh, stimulates ERK activation in T84 cells via transactivation of the EGFR (5.Keely S.J. Uribe J.M. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27111-27117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and that this constitutes, or contributes to, a mechanism by which CCh-stimulated chloride secretion is limited. In the present study we have sought to further elucidate the mechanisms by which CCh stimulates EGFR-dependent signaling in colonic epithelial cells. Our data suggest that the effects of CCh on EGFR activation are mediated by elevations in intracellular Ca2+ since treatment of T84 cells with TG (32.Treiman M. Caspersen C. Christensen S.B. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 131-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), which reliably increases levels of intracellular Ca2+ in T84cells without altering inositol phosphate turnover (8.Kachintorn U. Vajanaphanich M. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Dharmsathaphorn K. Barrett K.E. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 109: 510-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), stimulates both EGFR and ERK phosphorylation. Furthermore, the EGFR inhibitor, tyrphostin AG1478, at a concentration which does not inhibit signaling via other RTKs (33.Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar), significantly reduced the effect of TG on ERK phosphorylation. Since inhibition of either EGFR kinase activity, with tyrphostin AG1478, or of ERK activation, with PD98059 (34.Alessi DR Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Salteil A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3260) Google Scholar, 35.Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Salteil A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar), also results in potentiated and prolonged chloride secretory responses to TG, these data support the hypothesis that elevations in intracellular Ca2+ alone are a sufficient stimulus to bring about antisecretory signaling via the EGFR and ERK. That tyrphostin AG1478 does not abolish ERK phosphorylation in response to TG is interesting, in light of our previous studies. These showed that even though 1 μm tyrphostin AG1478 is sufficient to abolish CCh-stimulated EGFR phosphorylation, ERK phosphorylation in response to CCh is only partially (∼50%) reduced in the presence of the inhibitor. Thus, although the EGFR is likely to mediate a significant proportion of ERK activation in response to agents which elevate intracellular calcium, other pathways, which have yet to be defined, may also be involved. The hypothesis that Ca2+ mediates transactivation of the EGFR is further supported by our data demonstrating that chelation of intracellular Ca2+ with BAPTA/AM reduces CCh-stimulated EGFR phosphorylation which is in agreement with several studies in other cell types (10.Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T.

Similarly, increases in intracellular Ca2+, resulting from Ca2+ influx from the extracellular milieu, have been shown to mediate depolarization and GPCR-stimulated EGFR activation in PC12 cells (15.Rosen L.B.

In this report, we investigated the roles of superoxide anion (O⨪2), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and peroxynitrite (ONOO−) in TNF-α-triggered apoptosis of mesangial cells. Mesangial cells stimulated by TNF-α produced O⨪2 and underwent apoptosis.

TNF-α induces apoptosis by engaging a cell surface receptor, TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). Trimerization of TNFR1 by TNF-α induces association of the receptors' death domains. Subsequently, the adopter protein, namely, TNFR-associated death domain (TRADD) binds to the clustered receptor death domains through its own death domain. TRADD functions as a platform adapter that recruits Fas-associated death domain (FADD). FADD contains a death effector domain that binds to an analogous domain within procaspase-8. Upon recruitment by FADD, oligomerization of procaspase-8 drives its activation via self-cleavage and subsequently activates downstream effector caspases, leading to apoptosis (9.Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar). During this signaling process, ROS are supposed to play a critical role. It is based on the following evidence. (i) Stimulation of cells with TNF-α results in a rapid rise in the levels of intracellular ROS. (ii) Addition of ROS or depletion of endogenous antioxidants induces cellular death. (iii) TNF-α-triggered cytotoxicity is inhibited by antioxidants/ROS scavengers, including thioredoxin, N-acetylcysteine, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) (8.Heller R.A.

In biological systems, however, partial reduction of oxygen occurs, resulting in the generation of cytotoxic ROS. That is, the sequential reduction of oxygen leads to the generation of O⨪2, H2O2, and OH⋅ (12.Jacobson M.D. Trend Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 83-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). O⨪2 and H2O2 are thought to be the primary species generated. O⨪2 also rapidly reacts with nitric oxide (NO), yielding another reactive species, ONOO− (13.Szabo C. Ohshima H. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). In response to TNF-α, mammalian cells may produce O⨪2, H2O2, HO⋅, and ONOO−(2.Hennet T. Richter C. Peterhans E. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 3.Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Mari M. Morales A. Fernandez-Checa J.C. J. Biol.

All of these ROS have the potential for triggering apoptosis (10.Buttke T.M. Sandstrom P.A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 7-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2104) Google Scholar, 12.Jacobson M.D. Trend Biochem.

Currently, however, the involvement of and precise roles for individual ROS in mediating the apoptotic process are not well understood. It is largely unknown which compounds are required or not required for the TNF-α-initiated apoptosis. In the present report, we dissect the roles of ROS in the TNF-α signaling. The present data suggest that O⨪2 mediates TNF-α-induced apoptosis and that conversion of O⨪2 to its downstream ROS, including H2O2, ONOO−, and HO⋅ is not required to mediate the apoptotic process in mesangial cells. Mesangial cells (SM43) were established from isolated glomeruli of a male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rat and identified as being of mesangial cell phenotype as described before (14.Kitamura M. Taylor S. Unwin R. Burton S. Shimizu F. Fine L.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Medium containing 1% fetal calf serum (FCS) was generally used for experiments. The nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-inactive mesangial cell line SM/IκBαM was created by overexpressing the super-repressor mutant of IκBα, IκBαM (15.Moreno-Manzano V. Ishikawa Y. Lucio-Cazana J. Kitamura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20251-20258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). SM/IκBαM cells produce IκBαM protein, which is resistant to degradation, and exhibit blunted activation of NF-κB in response to interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and TNF-α (16.Sugiyama H. Savill J.S. Kitamura M. Zhao L. Stylianou E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19532-19537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As a control, mock-transfected mesangial cells that express neo alone (SM/Neo) were used. Expression of IκBα, IκBαM, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) was examined by Northern blot analysis (17.Kitamura M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1404-1411PubMed Google Scholar). Confluent mesangial cells (SM43, SM/Neo, and SM/IκBαM) cultured in the presence of 10% FCS were treated with or without human recombinant IL-1β (10 ng/ml; Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Tokushima, Japan) for 18 h and subjected to RNA extraction (18.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). cDNAs for IκBαM (19.Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M.

SM/IκBαM cells (1 × 105/well for 24-well plates; 5 × 105/well for 6-well plates) cultured in the presence of 1% FCS were stimulated by human recombinant TNF-α (250 units/ml; a gift from Dr. K. Noguchi, Teikyo University, Japan), H2O2 (100 μm; Sigma Immunochemicals, St. Louis, MO), or 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1, 1 mm; ICN Biomedicals, Oxford, UK) for up to 24 h. To examine the effects of antioxidants, cells were pretreated with catalase (500 units/ml; Sigma), glutathione ethyl ester (GSH, reduced form, 5 mm; Sigma), the cell-permeable O⨪2 scavenger Tiron (5 mm; Sigma) (22.Hein T.W. Kuom L. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 404-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), ONOO− scavenger uric acid (1 mm; Sigma), the nitric oxide synthesis inhibitorN G-nitro-l-argininemethyl ester hydrochloride (l-NAME, 1 mm; Sigma), or dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO; 20–100 mm; Sigma) for 1–3 h and then stimulated by TNF-α, H2O2, or SIN-1, as described above. The effect of O⨪2 on apoptosis was examined by exposing the cells to the superoxide-releasing agent 1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene (pyrogallol, 1 mm; Sigma) (23.Xie Y.W. Kaminski P.M. Wolin M.S. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 891-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) for up to 24 h in the presence or absence of antioxidants. Morphological examination was performed using phase-contrast microscopy. For fluorescence microscopy, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and stained using Hoechst 33258 (10 μg/ml; Sigma) for 1 h. Apoptosis was identified using morphological criteria, including shrinkage of the cytoplasm, membrane blebbing, and nuclear condensation and/or fragmentation. Quantitative assessment was performed using both attached and detached cells. After the induction of apoptosis, both attached and detached cells were harvested and subjected to ladder detection assay, as described previously (24.Ishikawa Y. Kitamura M. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 954-963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (25.Kitamura M. Ishikawa Y. Kidney Int. 1998; 53: 690-697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), SM/IκBαM cells cultured in 24-well plates (1.0–1.2 × 105/well, 10% FCS) were co-transfected with pCIneo-catalase (26.Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Griendling K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15022-15029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), pcDNA3-Mn-SOD (11.Manna S.K. Zhang H.J. Yan T. Oberley L.W. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13245-13254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), or an empty plasmid pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) (500 ng/well, respectively) together with pCI-βGal (167 ng/well; a gift from Promega, Madison, WI). pCI-βGal introduces a β-galactosidase gene under the control of the immediate-early enhancer/promoter of human cytomegalovirus. After incubation overnight, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 1% FCS. After 48 h, cells were treated with TNF-α (250 units/ml, 24 h) or H2O2 (100 μm, 6 h) and subjected to 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) assay (27.Kitamura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7387-7391Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Assays were performed in quadruplicate. The percentage of shrunk/rounded blue cells against the total number of blue cells was calculated for each well, and the mean value of four wells was used to compare data among different groups (28.Los M. Van de Craen M. Penning L.C. Schenk H. Westendorp M. Baeuerle P.A. Droge W. Krammer P.H. Fiers W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Nature. 1995; 375: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Production of O⨪2 was measured as the SOD-inhibitable reduction of cytochromec (29.Mayo L.A. Curnutte J.T. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). SM/IκBαM cells (2.5 × 106) were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in physiological salt solution (138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.1 mmNa2HPO4, 1.47 mmKH2PO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 7.5 mm glucose; pH 7.4) containing 80 μm cytochrome c (Sigma) in the absence or presence of TNF-α (250 units/ml) and SOD (50 units/ml; Sigma). After the incubation, supernatants were collected and centrifuged, and the absorbance (550 nm) was measured using a spectrophotometer. Samples incubated in the absence of cells were used as blanks. O⨪2 production was expressed as nanomoles/107 cells (29.Mayo L.A. Curnutte J.T. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Assays were performed in quadruplicate. Data were expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test to compare data among different groups. A p value of <0.05 was used to indicate a statistically significant difference. In many cell types, TNF-α rarely triggers apoptosis because of induction of anti-apoptotic proteins via NF-κB-dependent mechanisms (30.Sonenshein G.E. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). TNF-α-sensitive mesangial cells were created by overexpression of a super-repressor mutant of IκBα, IκBαM (19.Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar). Expression of the transgene in the established SM/IκBαM was confirmed by Northern blot analysis (Fig.1 A). To examine whether the overexpressed IκBαM is functional, parental cells (SM), mock-transfected cells (SM/Neo), and SM/IκBαM cells were cultured in the absence or presence of IL-1β (10 ng/ml), and expression of NF-κB-dependent genes, including endogenous IκBα and MCP-1 (31.Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Ann. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4602) Google Scholar), was examined. Under the basal culture condition, only faint expression of IκBα and MCP-1 was observed. When stimulated by IL-1β, expression of these genes was markedly up-regulated in the control cells, SM and SM/Neo. In contrast, the induction of IκBα and MCP-1 was attenuated in the NF-κB-inactive SM/IκBαM cells (Fig. 1, A and B). Using the established cells, susceptibility to the TNF-α-induced apoptosis was examined. Confluent SM/Neo cells and SM/IκBαM cells were exposed to TNF-α (250 units/ml), and microscopic analyses were performed. Phase-contrast microscopy showed that, like parental SM43 cells, SM/Neo cells were resistant to TNF-α-induced cell death (Fig.2 A, left) even at a high concentration (1000 units/ml, not shown). In contrast, TNF-α induced shrinkage and detachment of SM/IκBαM cells (Fig.2 A, right). Staining of the cells with Hoechst 33258 exhibited condensation and fragmentation of nuclei in TNF-α-exposed SM/IκBαM cells (46%) but not in TNF-α-exposed SM/Neo cells (1%) (Fig. 2 B). Consistently, agarose gel electrophoresis detected dramatic DNA laddering in TNF-α-treated SM/IκBαM cells but only slight laddering in TNF-α-treated SM/Neo cells (Fig. 2 C). ROS play a crucial role in the TNF-α-initiated signaling pathways. In particular, O⨪2 is one of the primary ROS produced in the cells stimulated by TNF-α (2.Hennet T. Richter C. Peterhans E. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). To examine the involvement of O⨪2 in the TNF-α-induced apoptosis of mesangial cells, SM/IκBαM cells were pretreated with a cell-permeable O⨪2 scavenger, Tiron (5 mm) and stimulated by TNF-α. Microscopic analysis revealed that the O⨪2 scavenger substantially attenuated TNF-α-induced, morphological changes, including cellular shrinkage and detachment (Fig. 3 A,top). Staining of the cells with Hoechst 33258 showed condensation and fragmentation of nuclei in TNF-α-treated cells, whereas it was markedly attenuated by the treatment with Tiron (Fig.3 A, bottom). The percentage of apoptotic cells was significantly reduced from 28.3 ± 2.2% (TNF-α alone) to 3.7 ± 0.4% (TNF-α + Tiron) (means ± S.E.,p < 0.05) (Fig. 3 B). Consistently, agarose gel electrophoresis showed that TNF-α-triggered DNA fragmentation was inhibited by the treatment with Tiron (Fig. 3 C). SOD scavenges O⨪2 by catalyzing the conversion of O⨪2to H2O2. The involvement of O⨪2 in the TNF-α-initiated apoptosis was further confirmed by transient transfection. SM/IκBαM cells were co-transfected with an empty plasmid or an expression plasmid for Mn-SOD together with a β-galactosidase plasmid. Cells were then treated with TNF-α for 24 h and subjected to X-gal assay. As shown in Fig. 3 D, treatment with TNF-α significantly increased percentages of apoptotic cells in mock-transfected cells (Mn-SOD (−)) (35.3 ± 0.4% (TNF-α) versus 10.4 ± 1.1% (untreated),p < 0.05). Transfection with Mn-SOD significantly reduced the percentage of apoptotic cells from 35.3 ± 0.4% in Mn-SOD (−)/TNF-α (+) to 15.8 ± 1.4% in Mn-SOD (+)/TNF-α (+). To further confirm the involvement of O⨪2 in the apoptotic process, production of O⨪2 was examined in TNF-α-treated and -untreated cells. SM/IκBαM cells were incubated for 3 h with or without TNF-α (250 units/ml) and SOD (50 units/ml), and production of O⨪2 was evaluated as the SOD-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c. As shown in Fig. 3 E, substantial induction of O⨪2 was observed in the TNF-α-stimulated cells (10.4 ± 0.3 nmol/107 TNF-α-stimulated cellsversus 4.8 ± 0.3 nmol/107 unstimulated cells, p < 0.05). Importantly, the reduction of cytochrome c in response to TNF-α was completely abrogated in the presence of SOD (not shown). This result indicated that O⨪2, but not other ROS with reducing activity, was produced by mesangial cells in response to TNF-α. In the biological systems, H2O2is primarily produced from O2 or generated from O⨪2via SOD. To examine the role of H2O2 in the TNF-α-induced apoptosis of mesangial cells, SM/IκBαM cells were pretreated with cell-permeable scavengers of H2O2, GSH (5 mm) or catalase (500 units/ml), and stimulated by TNF-α. Stimulation with H2O2 was used as a positive control. Microscopic analysis showed that, in the H2O2-exposed cells, the apoptotic change was abrogated by the treatment with GSH or catalase (Fig.4 A, bottom). In contrast, the morphological change induced by TNF-α was not attenuated by the treatment with H2O2scavengers (Fig. 4 A, top). Consistently, agarose gel electrophoresis revealed that neither GSH nor catalase suppressed DNA laddering in TNF-α-exposed cells, although DNA fragmentation induced by H2O2 was attenuated by these agents (Fig. 4 B). The lack of involvement of H2O2 in the TNF-α-initiated apoptosis was further confirmed by transient transfection. SM/IκBαM cells were co-transfected with an empty plasmid or an expression plasmid for catalase together with the β-galactosidase plasmid. Cells were then treated with TNF-α for 24 h or H2O2 (100 μm) for 6 h and subjected to X-gal assay. As shown in Fig. 4 C, treatment with TNF-α or H2O2 significantly increased percentages of apoptotic cells in mock-transfected cells (26.5 ± 0.9% (TNF-α) and 36.3 ± 4.2% (H2O2) versus 9.5 ± 1.2% (untreated control), p < 0.05). Transfection with catalase significantly reduced the percentage of apoptotic cells in H2O2-exposed cells from 36.3 ± 4.2% (catalase (−)) to 17.5 ± 1.0% (catalase (+)) (p< 0.05). In contrast, transfection with catalase did not inhibit TNF-α-induced apoptosis (26.5 ± 0.9% in catalase (−)versus 30.3 ± 1.5% in catalase (+), not significant). O⨪2 rapidly reacts with NO, yielding another reactive species, ONOO− (13.Szabo C. Ohshima H. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). TNF-α is known to induce production of NO as well as O⨪2, leading to generation of ONOO− (5.Phelps D.T. Ferro T.J. Higgins P.J. Shankar R. Parker D.M. Johnson A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: L551-L559PubMed Google Scholar). Recent investigations have suggested that, like O⨪2 and H2O2, ONOO− has the ability to induce apoptosis (13.Szabo C. Ohshima H. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). To examine the role of ONOO− in the TNF-α-induced apoptosis of mesangial cells, SM/IκBαM cells were pretreated with a scavenger of ONOO−, uric acid (1 mm), or an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis, l-NAME (1 mm), and stimulated by TNF-α. Stimulation with the ONOO−precursor SIN-1 (1 mm) was used as a positive control. SIN-1 simultaneously generates NO and O⨪2, forming ONOO− (13.Szabo C. Ohshima H. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Exposure of the cells to SIN-1 induced round-up of the cells, as shown in Fig.5 A (bottom). Hoechst staining showed condensation and fragmentation of nuclei typical of apoptosis (Fig. 5 B, bottom). Pretreatment with uric acid abolished the SIN-1-induced morphological changes. In contrast, under the same experimental condition, TNF-α-induced apoptosis was not affected by uric acid orl-NAME (Fig. 5, A and B,top). The percentages of apoptotic cells were 0.2 ± 0.2% in untreated control, 7.5 ± 0.7% in TNF-α alone, 8.8 ± 1.3% in uric acid + TNF-α, and 6.6 ± 0.9% inl-NAME + TNF-α (not statistically different) (Fig.5 C). The lack of involvement of H2O2 and ONOO− was further confirmed by concurrent scavenging of these ROS. SM/IκBαM cells were pretreated with uric acid together with catalase and stimulated by TNF-α, H2O2, or SIN-1. Phase-contrast microscopy and Hoechst staining showed that the double ROS scavenging attenuated apoptosis induced by H2O2 or SIN-1. However, the TNF-α-induced apoptosis was not inhibited even in the concurrent presence of the H2O2 scavenger and the ONOO−scavenger (Fig. 6, A andB). The percentages of apoptotic cells were 0.6 ± 0.2% in untreated control, 18.9 ± 2.9% in TNF-α alone, and 27.3 ± 3.0% in uric acid/catalase + TNF-α (Fig.6 C). Consistently, TNF-α-triggered DNA laddering was observed regardless of the presence of uric acid and catalase (Fig.6 D). HO⋅ is generated by reduction of H2O2 or through ONOO− (12.Jacobson M.D. Trend Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 83-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). The lack of involvement of H2O2 and ONOO− in the TNF-α-induced apoptosis was further confirmed using a HO⋅scavenger, Me2SO. SM/IκBαM cells were pretreated with Me2SO (20–100 mm) and stimulated by TNF-α. As shown in Fig. 6 E, pretreatment with Me2SO did not affect the TNF-α-induced apoptosis. The percentages of apoptotic cells were 1.2 ± 0.5% in untreated control, 19.5 ± 2.1% in TNF-α alone, 17.8 ± 1.1% in 20 mmMe2SO + TNF-α, and 17.7 ± 1.1% in 100 mm Me2SO + TNF-α (not statistically different). To evaluate the pro-apoptotic potential of O⨪2, SM/IκBαM cells were stimulated by O⨪2-releasing agent, pyrogallol. Hoechst staining showed that pyrogallol induced round-up of the cells and condensation and fragmentation of nuclei typical of apoptosis (Fig.7 A, left). The percentage of apoptotic cells was increased from 0.6 ± 0.2% to 37.8 ± 5.3% by the treatment with pyrogallol (Fig.7 A, right). To examine whether O⨪2 induces apoptosis even without its conversion to H2O2 or ONOO−, SM/IκBαM cells were stimulated by pyrogallol in the presence of excessive catalase (1000 units/ml) and uric acid (2 mm). Hoechst staining showed that substantial induction of apoptosis was still observed even in the concurrent presence of scavengers for H2O2 and ONOO− (Fig.7 B, left). The percentages of apoptotic cells were 0.3 ± 0.3% in uric acid/catalase and 11.3 ± 1.1% in uric acid/catalase + TNF-α (Fig. 7 B,right). TNF-α induces generation of ROS that may serve as second messengers for cell death signaling. Currently, precise roles of individual ROS in the cytotoxic action of TNF-α are not well understood. Previous reports showed that cellular sensitivity or resistance to TNF cytotoxicity is correlated with decreased or increased levels of SOD, respectively (11.Manna S.K. Zhang H.J. Yan T. Oberley L.W. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13245-13254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 32.Wong G.H. Elwell J.H. Oberley L.W. Goeddel D.V.

FASEB J. 1993; 7: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). These data indicated that O⨪2 has a role in mediating TNF-induced cellular death. However, TNF-α induces both necrosis and apoptosis via ROS-dependent mechanisms (6.Schulze-Osthoff K. Bakker A.C. Vanhaesebroeck B. Beyaert R. Jacob W.A. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5317-5323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Schulze-Osthoff K. Beyaert R. Vandevoorde V. Haegeman G. Fiers W.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Current unanswered questions are; (i) whether or not O⨪2 is indeed essential for TNF-α-induced apoptosis, and if so, (ii) how the secondary compounds downstream of O⨪2 contribute to the apoptotic process. In this report, we provided evidence for the selective, crucial role of ROS in the TNF-α-triggered apoptosis of mesangial cells. In biological systems, O⨪2 is rapidly reduced by SOD to H2O2. O⨪2 also rapidly reacts with NO, yielding ONOO− (13.Szabo C. Ohshima H. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Once O⨪2 is generated in response to TNF-α, H2O2 and ONOO− may be subsequently produced and contribute to the apoptotic process. In the present study, however, scavengers of H2O2 and ONOO− did not have any effects on TNF-α-induced apoptosis. This evidence supports the selective and differential roles of ROS in mediating the apoptotic pathway. Only O⨪2 is necessary, and conversion of O⨪2 to its downstream compounds H2O2 and ONOO− is supposedly not required to mediate the TNF-initiated apoptosis. HO⋅ is generated by reduction of H2O2 or through ONOO− (12.Jacobson M.D. Trend Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 83-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). HO⋅ is known to be a highly reactive ROS and may be responsible for the oxidative damage of the cells (12.Jacobson M.D. Trend Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 83-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). A previous report showed that induction of HO⋅ is responsible for the cytotoxic effect of TNF-α on tumor cells (4.Yamauchi N. Kuriyama H. Watanabe N. Neda H. Maeda M. Niitsu Y. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 1671-1675PubMed Google Scholar). However, based on our current data, the contribution of HO⋅ to the apoptotic process of mesangial cells is unlikely, because; (i) TNF-α-induced apoptosis occurred independently of H2O2 and ONOO−, the compounds upstream of HO⋅, and (ii) the scavenger of HO⋅, Me2SO, did not affect TNF-α-induced apoptosis. Intracellular sources of ROS include mitochondrial oxidation, the microsomal cytochrome P-450 system, and plasma membrane NADPH oxidases. Previous studies suggested that the mitochondrial respiratory chain is the major source of TNF-induced formation of ROS (6.Schulze-Osthoff K. Bakker A.C. Vanhaesebroeck B. Beyaert R. Jacob W.A. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5317-5323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Schulze-Osthoff K. Beyaert R. Vandevoorde V. Haegeman G. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3095-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). In mesangial cells, the NADPH oxidase system seems to play a crucial role in the generation of ROS. For example, mesangial cells have functional NADPH oxidase components (36.Radeke H.H. Cross A.R. Hancock J.T. Jones O.T.G. Nakamura M. Kaever V. Resch K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21025-21029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and inhibition of the NADPH oxidase system suppresses expression of chemokines in response to TNF-α (37.Satriano J.A. Shuldiner M. Hora K. Xing Y. Shan Z. Schlondorff D. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1564-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The NADPH oxidase system may participate in the apoptotic process mediated by O⨪2 in TNF-α-stimulated mesangial cells. In contrast to the knowledge on the sources of ROS, little is understood about molecular targets of ROS during the apoptotic process. Direct DNA damage or formation of oxidized lipids in cell membranes may mediate or facilitate TNF-α-induced apoptosis (10.Buttke T.M. Sandstrom P.A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 7-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2104) Google Scholar). Alternatively, particular signaling molecules may be affected by ROS directly or indirectly. A recent study suggested that apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is a possible target of ROS (38.Gotoh Y. Cooper J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17477-17482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). ASK1 is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase superfamily that activates both the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway and the p38 MAP kinase pathway by direct phosphorylation of MKK3, -4, -6, and -7 (39.Wang X.S. Diener K. Jannuzzi D. Trollinger D. Tan T.H. Lichenstein H. Zukowski M. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31607-31611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 40.Ichijo H.

ASK1 is involved in the TNF-α-induced apoptotic pathway, because ASK1 is activated by TNF-α in many cell types, overexpression of ASK1 induces apoptosis, and expression of dominant-negative ASK1 inhibits TNF-α-induced apoptosis (40.Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten-Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar). Gotohet al. (38.Gotoh Y. Cooper J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17477-17482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) found that ROS induces activation of ASK1, that TNF-α-triggered activation of ASK1 is inhibited by antioxidants, and that ROS-induced apoptosis is markedly enhanced by overexpression of ASK1. These results suggested that TNF-α-induced activation of ASK1 is caused by ROS and contributes to the induction of apoptosis. Of note, ASK1 has a cysteine-rich domain in its N terminus. It might be a direct target for the action of ROS (38.Gotoh Y. Cooper J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17477-17482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). TNF-α induces apoptosis by engaging TNFR1. After ligation of the receptors, TRADD and FADD are recruited, leading to activation of downstream effector caspases (9.Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar). A recent report showed that activation of Z-VAD-sensitive caspase(s) is required for mitochondria-dependent ROS production (41.Sidoti-de-Fraisse C. Rincheval V. Risler Y. Mignotte B. Vayssiere J.L. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1639-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This result is consistent with another recent report that showed that staurosporine-induced apoptosis involves caspase-1-like proteases as initiators upstream of O⨪2 production (42.Krohn A.J. Preis E. Prehn J.H. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8186-8197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data indicate a possibility that the ROS-mediated process is an event downstream of serial caspase activation initiated by TNF-α. Another putative mechanism implicated in TNF-α-mediated apoptosis is via generation of ceramide, the hydrolyzed product of the phospholipid sphingomyelin (43.Krown K.A. Page M.T. Nguyen C. Zechner D. Gutierrez V. Comstock K.L. Glembotski C.C. Quintana P.J. Sabbadini R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2854-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). A recent study suggested that the sphingomyelin pathway has a role in TNF-α-induced ROS production. Garcia-Ruizet al. showed that mitochondria isolated from TNF-treated cells exhibit an increase in the amount of ceramide, that addition of C2-ceramide to mitochondria leads ROS generation, and that blockade of the electron transport chain prevents the C2-ceramide-induced production of ROS (3.Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Mari M. Morales A. Fernandez-Checa J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11369-11377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). In contrast, another recent study indicated that ROS participate in TNF-mediated ceramide production (44.Singh I. Pahan K. Khan M. Singh A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20354-20362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), suggesting that the ROS-sensitive pathway may be located upstream of ceramide production. Further investigation is required to disclose the relationship between ROS and the sphingomyelin pathway during TNF-α-induced apoptosis. The differential roles of ROS in signal transduction pathways, especially in apoptotic pathways, have not been addressed before. The present study showed the selective involvement of O⨪2, but not its downstream compounds H2O2, ONOO−, and HO· in TNF-α-induced apoptosis. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the differential roles of O⨪2 and downstream compounds in this particular apoptotic process. We thank Drs I. M. Verma, L. W. Oberley, and S.

Consequently, new antifibrotic therapies are directed toward an inhibition of HSC activities. The aim of the present study was to develop a drug carrier to HSC, which would allow cell-specific delivery of antifibrotic drugs thus enhancing their effectiveness in vivo. We modified human serum albumin (HSA) with 10 cyclic peptide moieties recognizing collagen type VI receptors (C*GRGDSPC*, in which C* denotes the cyclizing cysteine residues) yielding pCVI-HSA. In vivoexperiments showed preferential distribution of pCVI-HSA to both fibrotic and normal rat livers (respectively, 62 ± 6 and 75 ± 16% of the dose at 10 min after intravenous injection). Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that pCVI-HSA predominantly bound to HSC in fibrotic livers (73 ± 14%). In contrast, endothelial cells contributed mostly to the total liver accumulation in normal rats. In vitro studies showed that pCVI-HSA specifically bound to rat HSC, in particular to the activated cells, and showed internalization of pCVI-HSA by these cells. In conclusion, pCVI-HSA may be applied as a carrier to deliver antifibrotic agents to HSC, which may strongly enhance the effectiveness and tissue selectivity of these drugs. This approach has the additional benefit that such carriers may block receptors that play a putative role in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis.

The major cell type responsible for hepatic fibrogenesis is the activated hepatic stellate cell (HSC)1 (1.Ramadori G. Knittel T. Saile B. Digestion. 1998; 59: 372-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 2.Arthur M.J.P. Digestion. 1998; 59: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 3.Alcolado R. Arthur M.J.P.

Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 66: 387-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Therefore, this cell type is an important target for antifibrotic therapies. However, contrary to in vitro data, in vivo studies indicate that most antifibrogenic agents are not efficiently taken up by HSC. To attain HSC-specific uptake, drugs can be coupled to carrier molecules that are designed for selective uptake by target cells. To date, drug carriers to hepatocytes, Kupffer, and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells have been described extensively (6.Meijer D.K.F. Molema G. Semin. Liver Dis. 1995; 15: 202-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 7.Beljaars L. Poelstra K. Molema G. Meijer D.K.F. J. Hepatol. 1998; 29: 579-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 8.Albrecht C. Meijer D.K.F. Lebbe C. Sägesser H. Melgert B.N. Poelstra K. Reichen J. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 1553-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported about a neoglycoprotein, albumin modified with mannose 6-phosphate moieties (M6P28-HSA), which preferentially distributed to HSC in fibrotic rat livers (9.Beljaars L. Molema G. Weert B. Bonnema H. Olinga P. Groothuis G.M.M. Meijer D.K.F. Poelstra K. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1486-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We now choose a different approach for the development of drug carriers. This approach is based on the use of peptide moieties as a homing device. These (cyclic) peptides are designed to recognize specific (pathological) receptors on target cells. If successful, this may have implications for the design of other receptor-specific carriers. Specific interactions between cells and extracellular matrix components are mediated by transmembrane proteins, in particular the heterodimeric integrins. Cell-matrix interactions guide or modulate many cellular activities, such as adhesion, migration, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (10.Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 697-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (2570) Google Scholar, 11.Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9014) Google Scholar, 12.Aumailley M. Gayraud B. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Many integrins recognize and bind the amino acid sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) present in various matrix proteins. Collagen type VI is a major matrix protein involved in the adhesion of cells to the surrounding matrix. In addition, it interacts with a number of other matrix molecules such as collagens type I and III, decorin, and hyaluronic acid (12.Aumailley M. Gayraud B. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The main cellular sources of collagen type VI in normal and fibrotic livers are HSC (13.Loreal O. Clement B. Schuppan D. Rescan P.Y. Rissel M. Guillouzo A. Gastroenterology. 1992; 102: 980-987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In normal livers, collagen type VI is localized in the portal areas and at the plasma membranes of hepatocytes, endothelial cells, and HSC within the lobule. The hepatic deposition of this type of collagen is increased during liver fibrosis, in particular in the fibrous septa that invade the lobule (14.Schuppan D. Ruhlmann T. Hahn E.G. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 149: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15.Takahara T. Sollberg S. Muona P. Uitto J. Liver. 1995; 15: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Serum levels of collagen type VI allowed the non-invasive differentiation of children with liver fibrosis from those without fibrosis approaching a 100% accuracy (16.Gerling B. Becker M. Staab D. Schuppan D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1611-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It could be demonstrated that the core fragment of collagen type VI has potent growth factor activities stimulating DNA synthesis of mesenchymal cells severalfold via activation of erk2 and tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins (17.Ruhl M. Johannson M. Atkinson J. Manski D. Sahin E. Somasundaram R. Riecken E.O. Schuppan D. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 548-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 18.Atkinson J.C. Ruhl M. Becker J. Ackermann R. Schuppan D. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 228: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Binding of cells to collagen type VI by integrins is RGD-dependent. Although several RGD sequences are found in collagen type VI, Marcellino and McDevitt (19.Marcelino J. McDevitt C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1249: 180-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) showed that the cyclic peptide C*GRGDSPC* specifically inhibited the attachment of collagen type VI to cells, while the RGD-dependent binding of fibronectin to these cells was not inhibited. Furthermore, the linear analogue of this peptide failed to inhibit the cellular attachment of collagen type VI (19.Marcelino J. McDevitt C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1249: 180-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), indicating that a non-integrin collagen type VI receptor was antagonized by this peptide. Therefore, we studied whether C*GRGDSPC*, which selectively interferes with collagen type VI-mediated cell adhesion, can be used as a homing device to target to HSC in fibrotic livers. In this study, we present evidence that human serum albumin (HSA) modified with this cyclic peptide binds to HSC in vivo and in vitro and is applicable as a drug carrier to this crucial cell type in liver fibrosis. The cyclic peptide C*GRGDSPC* was prepared by Ansynth Service BV (Roosendaal, The Netherlands). HSA was obtained from the Central Laboratory of Blood Transfusion Services (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and consisted mainly of monomeric protein. All other reagents were of the highest purity grade available. The cyclic octapeptide C*GRGDSPC* was covalently coupled to HSA as illustrated in Fig. 1. First, a sulfhydryl group was introduced into the cyclic peptide. Therefore, C*GRGDSPC* was dissolved in dimethyl formamide and reacted with N-succinimidyl S-acetyl thioacetate (Pierce) for 2 h in the presence of diisopropylethylamine. Primary ε-NH2 groups of lysine moieties in HSA were derivatized with maleimido-hexanoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2. Subsequently, the cyclic peptide was added to HSA. The molar ratio peptide to HSA determined the degree of substitution. Hydroxylamine was added to remove the protecting acetate group from the sulfhydryl group of the cyclic peptide. The mixture was stirred for 2 h. The obtained product was purified with Sephadex G-25SF gel chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C until use. The molecular weight of pCVI-HSA and HSA was determined by a 7.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fast protein liquid chromatography analysis. The fast protein liquid chromatography system was equipped with a Superdex-200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and an UV detector (280 nm). The proteins (0.2 mg) were eluted with phosphate-buffered saline at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The amount of α-helices and β-sheets in pCVI-HSA was determined by recording circular dichroism (CD) spectra in the 197–250 nm range with an circular dichroism spectrometer model 62A DS (AVIV Instruments, Lakewood, NY) (20.Provencher S.W. Glockner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar). The spectra were the average of 5 scans (1 nm band width, 1-nm step width, 1 s averaging time per point) recorded at constant temperature (20 °C). The spectrum of pCVI-HSA (0.2 mg/ml phosphate-buffered saline) was compared with the spectra of native HSA and HSA treated with dithiothreitol (Sigma), which induces linearization of proteins by cleavage of disulfide bridges (21.Pless D.P. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). pCVI-HSA and HSA were labeled with 125I as described by Mather and Ward (22.Mather S.J. Ward B.C. J. Nucl. Med. 1987; 28: 1034-1036PubMed Google Scholar) to a specific activity of 2.5 × 106 cpm/μg for in vivo and in vitrostudies. Before each experiment, protein bound radioactivity was measured after precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The preparations were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline if the solution contained of >5% free 125I. Male Wistar rats (±250 g, obtained from Harlan, Zeist, The Netherlands) were housed in 12-h light/dark cycles at constant temperature and humidity and maintained on standard lab chow and tap water. The study as presented was approved by the Local Committee for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and was performed according to strict governmental and international guidelines on animal experimentation. To induce liver fibrosis, the rats were submitted to common bile duct ligation (BDL) under fluothane/O2 anesthesia (23.Kountouras J. Billing B.H. Scheuer P.J. Br. J. Exp. Pathol. 1984; 65: 305-311PubMed Google Scholar). Three weeks after bile duct ligation (BDL3), these fibrotic rats were used for in vivo experiments. Previous studies showed that the livers of these rats displayed all signs of fibrosis, that is abundant HSC proliferation and excessive matrix deposition (7.Beljaars L. Poelstra K. Molema G. Meijer D.K.F. J. Hepatol. 1998; 29: 579-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Distribution studies were performed as described (9.Beljaars L. Molema G. Weert B. Bonnema H. Olinga P. Groothuis G.M.M. Meijer D.K.F. Poelstra K. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1486-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The distributions of 125I-pCVI-HSA and 125I-HSA were assessed at 10, 30, or 180 min after intravenous injection of tracer doses in the penis vene in normal and BDL3 rats. Anesthetized normal and BDL3 rats received an intravenous dose of 10 mg/kg pCVI-HSA (via the penis vene). Ten minutes after administration, specimens of liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys, and muscles were frozen in isopentane (−80 °C) for immunohistochemical analysis. Since technical problems hampered the preparation of bone cryostat sections, acetone fixed specimens of the hind leg bone were embedded in glycol methacrylate plastic after dehydration in an alcohol series according to standard procedures (24.Van Goor H. Gerrits P.O. Hardonk M.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1989; 37: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Acetone-fixed cryostat sections (4 μm) of liver, spleen, lung, and kidneys were stained for the presence of pCVI-HSA with a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against HSA (Cappel, Organon Teknika, Turnhout, Belgium) according to standard indirect immunoperoxidase methods using aminoethyl carbazole (25.Harms G. Dijkstra C.D. Lee Y.C. Hardonk M.J. Cell Tissue Res. 1990; 262: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The polyclonal antibody displayed no cross-reactivity with rat serum albumin. To assess whether the modified albumins were taken up by HSC, Kupffer cells, or endothelial cells, the liver sections were double stained with HSA antibodies and a cell type-specific marker (9.Beljaars L. Molema G. Weert B. Bonnema H. Olinga P. Groothuis G.M.M. Meijer D.K.F. Poelstra K. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1486-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). HSC were demonstrated with two mouse monoclonal primary antibodies directed against desmin (Cappel) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (Biogenex, San Ramon, CA). Kupffer cells and endothelial cells were detected with the monoclonal antibodies ED2 and HIS52, respectively (both Serotec, Oxford, United Kingdom). The sections stained for the modified albumin and the hepatic cell markers were quantitatively evaluated in a double-blind manner by two independent observers as described before (9.Beljaars L. Molema G. Weert B. Bonnema H. Olinga P. Groothuis G.M.M. Meijer D.K.F. Poelstra K. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1486-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The number of double positive cells was related to the total number of HSA-positive cells yielding a relative accumulation of pCVI-HSA by each cell type. The double staining techniques were also used to examine spleen, lung, and kidneys for the co-localization of pCVI-HSA with fibroblast markers (with antibodies against desmin, α-smooth muscle actin (Sigma), and vimentin (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark)), or with the monocyte/macrophage marker ED1 (DAKO). The presence of pCVI-HSA in plastic embedded bone was studied by immunohistochemical staining of 0.1% trypsine-treated sections (2 μm) and anti-HSA IgG (9.Beljaars L. Molema G. Weert B. Bonnema H. Olinga P. Groothuis G.M.M. Meijer D.K.F. Poelstra K. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1486-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 24.Van Goor H. Gerrits P.O. Hardonk M.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1989; 37: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The staining in bone was detected after amplification of the signal with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and rabbit anti-goat IgG. Glycol methacrylate-plastic embedded liver samples containing HSA were prepared and treated similarly and served as positive controls. The livers of male Wistar rats (450–550 g) were perfused with Gey's balanced salt solution (GBSS) containing collagenase P (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany), Pronase (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and DNase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The HSC were separated from the other hepatic cells by density-gradient centrifugation and collected at the top of an 11% Nycodenz solution (Nyegaard, Oslo, Norway). The cells were then cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, Scotland) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (26.Geerts A. Niki T. Hellemans K. De Craemer D. Van den Berg K. Lazou J.-M. Stange G. Van de Winkel M. De Bleser P.J. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 590-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). After 2 days, cell debris and nonadherent cells were removed by washing and the medium was changed every 2 or 3 days thereafter. Cells cultured for 2 days after isolation represented quiescent HSC, whereas those cultured for 10 days after isolation represented activated HSC (26.Geerts A. Niki T. Hellemans K. De Craemer D. Van den Berg K. Lazou J.-M. Stange G. Van de Winkel M. De Bleser P.J. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 590-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The cellular handling of 125I-pCVI-HSA was assessed in cultures of quiescent HSC and activated HSC and compared with 125I-HSA. Before each experiment, HSC were trypsinized and seeded in plastic 35-mm dishes (Falcon, Becton Dickinson, Lincoln Park, NJ) at a density of approximately 70,000 HSC per dish (2,000/cm2) and cultured overnight at 37 °C. Then the number of adherent cells (nonconfluent cell layer) was counted using a phase-contrast microscope. The cells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin/DMEM for 15 min at 4 °C and subsequently incubated with 50,000 cpm of125I-pCVI-HSA or 125I-HSA per dish in 0.2% bovine serum albumin/DMEM for 0.5 to 24 h at 4 and 37 °C. The medium was removed after the incubation period and analyzed for the presence of degradation products by precipitation of the protein bound radioactivity with a 10% trichloroacetic acid solution. Subsequently, the dishes were washed three times with cold GBSS, and the cells were harvested with a cell scraper (Costar, Cambridge, MA) to assess the total amount of cell bound radioactivity. We performed inhibition experiments to determine the specificity of binding and uptake of 125I-pCVI-HSA to HSC. We added an excess of unlabeled pCVI-HSA (30 μm dissolved in GBSS) to the incubation media at 4 °C. At 37 °C, 2 μmmonensin (Sigma, dissolved in ethanol), an inhibitor of endocytosis, was added to the incubation media. HSC (10 days old) were seeded on glass Lab-tek chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) and recultured overnight in cDMEM. Adherent cells were incubated with 1 mg/ml pCVI-HSA or HSA for 2 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, the wells were washed three times with DMEM and fixed with acetone/methanol (1:1, v/v). To detect modified albumins bound to activated HSC, the slides were stained with anti-HSA antibodies as described above. Incubations of cells and pCVI-HSA were also performed in the presence of 1 μg/ml soluble collagen type VI (18.Atkinson J.C. Ruhl M. Becker J. Ackermann R. Schuppan D. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 228: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) or the polyanion suramin (200 μm, obtained from ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH). To determine the degradation of pCVI-HSA and HSA, we used precision-cut liver slices, containing all hepatic cells in their native state. Fresh slices (±12 mg wet weight) were prepared from BDL rat livers with a Krumdieck slicer and stored in ice-cold UW until the start of the experiments (27.Olinga P. Groen K. Hof I.H. de Kanter R. Koster H.J. Leeman W.R. Rutten A.A.J.J.L. van Twillert K. Groothuis G.M.M. J. Pharmacol. Toxicol. Methods. 1997; 38: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 28.Olinga P. Merema M. Hof I.H. de Jong K.P. Slooff M.J.H. Meijer D.K.F. Groothuis G.M.M. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1998; 26: 5-11PubMed Google Scholar). The slices were incubated with 125I-pCVI-HSA or 125I-HSA (150,000 cpm/well), as described (9.Beljaars L. Molema G. Weert B. Bonnema H. Olinga P. Groothuis G.M.M. Meijer D.K.F. Poelstra K. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1486-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), for 2–24 h at 37 °C. After the incubation period, the medium was used for the determination of released degradation products by precipitation of the protein bound radioactivity with 10% trichloroacetic acid. To assess the binding of pCVI-HSA to matrix proteins, we coated 0.15 mg of collagen S (=90% collagen type I, 10% collagen type III, and others, obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals) overnight at 37 °C in 35-mm dishes. In addition, the individual matrix proteins collagen type I, III, IV, and VI (10 μg/dish, collagen type I, III, and IV were obtained from Sigma) were coated to dishes. These dishes were washed twice with ice-cold GBSS, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin/DMEM for 15 min at 4 °C, and subsequently incubated with 50,000 cpm of125I-pCVI-HSA or 125I-HSA/dish in 0.2% bovine serum albumin/DMEM for 2 h at 4 °C. After the incubation period, the dishes were washed three times with cold GBSS and the total amount of collagen bound radioactivity was harvested with a cell scraper (Costar) and measured with a γ-counter. Results were expressed as the mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis of the data was performed with an unpaired Student's t test. The differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. After modification of albumin with the cyclic peptide C*GRGDSPC*, the molecular weight of the pCVI-HSA complex was demonstrated to be higher than that of unmodified HSA (Fig. 2 A). The molecular weight of one cyclic peptide moiety was 92,000. From the increase in molecular weight, we estimated that pCVI-HSA contained an average of 10 cyclic peptide moieties per HSA molecule. Only monomeric protein was detected after Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of the gel, while no residual unmodified HSA was found in the pCVI-HSA preparation. In addition, fast protein liquid chromatography-Superdex analysis was performed with pCVI-HSA and HSA. The chromatograms of pCVI-HSA and HSA were similar as depicted in Fig. 2 B, indicating minor polymerization of the protein after the chemical procedures. The major part of the pCVI-HSA preparation consisted of monomeric protein (75%). The decrease in the retention time from 34.5 min (HSA) to 33.0 min (pCVI-HSA) reflects the increased molecular weight of the modified albumin. Attachment of cyclic peptide moieties to albumin might induce conformational changes in the HSA molecule. Therefore, we assessed the secondary structure of pCVI-HSA using circular dichroism analysis and compared the obtained spectrum to that of HSA. The CD spectra of both pCVI-HSA and HSA were alike (Fig. 3), which indicates that the amount of α-helices and β-sheets are comparable in pCVI-HSA and HSA. HSA treated with dithiothreitol served as a positive control. The cleavage of disulfide bridges by this reducing agent resulted in unfolding of HSA and destruction of its secondary structure, which was reflected by a change in the CD spectrum (Fig. 3). The organ distribution of 125I-pCVI-HSA was studied in normal rats and in rats with advanced liver fibrosis (BDL3). After intravenous administration of 125I-pCVI-HSA, this drug carrier was rapidly cleared from the blood (Fig. 4, A andB). Already at 10 min after injection, only 15 ± 4% (normal rats) and 17 ± 4% (BDL3 rats) of the pCVI-HSA dose was present in the blood. In contrast, the complete dose of125I-HSA was recovered in blood at that time point without significant distribution to any other organ (Fig. 4 C). No significant differences were found between the radioactivity detected in blood and in plasma indicating that pCVI-HSA did not bind to blood cells. The organ responsible for most of the uptake of125I-pCVI-HSA was the liver. After 10 min 75 ± 16 and 62 ± 6% of the dose distributed to the livers of normal and BDL3 rats, respectively. The hepatic content of pCVI-HSA gradually declined with time and 125I-pCVI-HSA and/or degradation products redistributed to urine, and to a minor degree to the intestinal tract, muscles, and skin. The radioactivity excreted by the kidneys into urine consisted of non-protein bound radioactivity as assessed after trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Minor amounts of the dose of125I-pCVI-HSA were taken up by the spleen (4.9 ± 1.2 and 7.3 ± 4.2% for normal and BDL3 rats, respectively) and kidneys (2.6 ± 0.5 and 1.8 ± 0.5% for normal and BDL3 rats, respectively). Also, radioactivity was recovered in bone, muscle, and skin of the rats. The accumulation of 125I-pCVI-HSA in all organs and tissues was not significantly different between diseased and non-diseased rats at any time point tested. Immunohistochemical analysis of organ sections confirmed the major distribution of pCVI-HSA to the liver in both normal and BDL3 rats. Also distribution to the spleen was detected immunohistochemically. The localization of pCVI-HSA in the spleen corresponded with vimentin staining, which outlined the venous sinusoids in the spleen. It did not correspond with desmin, α-smooth muscle actin, or ED1 (macrophage) staining. In BDL3 rats also, cells of the lung, identified as macrophages, stained positive for pCVI-HSA. In contrast to the staining found in the plastic-embedded livers, the staining in bone could only be detected after amplification of the peroxidase signal. The staining of bone was identified as nonspecific precipitated material in blood vessels and no cell associated staining was found. None of the other tissues stained positive for anti-HSA IgG at 10 min after administration of pCVI-HSA. Fig.5 A shows the localization of pCVI-HSA in BDL3 livers as detected immunohistochemically. In BDL3 as well as normal livers, the carrier pCVI-HSA distributed to the nonparenchymal cells, whereas no accumulation of this modified albumin could be found in hepatocytes or bile duct epithelial cells. pCVI-HSA did not bind to cells in the portal areas of BDL3 rat livers 10 min after intravenous injection. Double-staining of liver sections was performed to identify the cell type(s) responsible for hepatic accumulation of pCVI-HSA. In fibrotic rat livers, pCVI-HSA staining corresponded mainly with the localization of desmin and glial fibrillary acidic protein (Fig. 5 B), whereas in normal rat livers pCVI-HSA distributed predominantly to HIS52-positive endothelial cells. Quantitative evaluation of the liver sections confirmed these observations (TableI). In normal rat livers, 70 ± 7% of total hepatic pCVI-HSA uptake was attributable to endothelial cells, whereas in BDL3 rat livers the major part of HSA positive cells (73 ± 14%) were identified as HSC. This increase in HSC uptake in fibrotic livers was paralleled by a concomitantly decreased endothelial uptake (30 ± 10%). Minor accumulation was found in Kupffer cells. Attempts to double label the transformed HSC (myofibroblasts) failed due to the insensitivity of the α-smooth muscle actin antibody with alkaline phosphatase detection, but lack of pCVI-HSA staining in the portal areas where actin-positive cells are most abundant indicates no uptake by the cells in these areas.Table IRelative accumulation of pCVI-HSA in the hepatic cell types in normal and fibrotic (BDL3) rat liverspCVI-HSAHSCKCECNormal7 ± 2%3 ± 2%70 ± 7%BDL373 ± 14%16 ± 11%30 ± 10%The contribution of hepatic stellate cells (HSC), Kupffer cells (KC), and endothelial cells (EC) in the total liver uptake of the neoglycoprotein was determined by counting the number of cells positive for both pCVI-HSA and the respective cell type marker, and the total number of pCVI-HSA positive cells in the same microscopic field.

First, we determined the binding and uptake of 125I-pCVI-HSA to quiescent and activated HSC. The results were compared with data obtained by incubation of the cells with 125I-HSA. As shown in Fig.6, significantly higher amounts of125I-pCVI-HSA bound to activated HSC at both 4 and 37 °C as compared with 125I-HSA. In contrast, quiescent HSC did not bind significant amounts of the modified albumin. Cell-associated radioactivity was significantly higher at 37 °C t"

The mechanism underlying the increased proliferation could involve the induction of components of the insulin-like growth factor signal transduction pathway by estrogen. In this study we have examined the regulation of the expression of insulin receptor substrate-1, a major intracellular substrate of the type I insulin-like growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase. Estradiol increased insulin receptor substrate-1 mRNA and protein levels at concentrations consistent with a mechanism involving the estrogen receptor. Insulin receptor substrate-1 was not induced significantly by the antiestrogens tamoxifen and ICI 182,780, but they inhibited the induction of insulin receptor substrate-1 by estradiol. Analysis of tyrosine-phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 showed that the highest levels were found in cells stimulated by estradiol and insulin-like growth factor-I, whereas low levels were found in the absence of estradiol irrespective of whether type I insulin-like growth factor ligands were present. Insulin receptor substrate-2, -3, and -4 were not induced by estradiol. These results suggest that estrogens and antiestrogens may regulate cell proliferation by controlling insulin receptor substrate-1 expression, thereby amplifying or attenuating signaling through the insulin-like growth factor signal transduction pathway.

The mechanisms by which estrogens stimulate cell proliferation, however, are not clear. The proliferation of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell lines is stimulated by estrogen in culture, and these cell lines provide useful model systems for determining how estrogens stimulate breast cancer cell proliferation. The proliferation of breast cancer cells in culture is also responsive to insulin-like growth factors, and components of the IGF1 signal transduction system are expressed by both breast tumors and cultured breast cancer cells (1.Lee A.V.

We along with others have suggested that estrogens control cell proliferation by modulating the proliferative response of breast cancer cells to IGFs (6.Thorsen T. Lahooti R. Rasmussen M. Aakvaag A.

Estrogen-responsive breast cancer cells show a much greater proliferative response to high concentrations of insulin (acting through the type I IGF receptor) or physiological concentrations of IGFs in the presence of estrogen, and conversely the proliferative response to estradiol is much greater in the presence of insulin or IGFs. The proliferative effects of IGFs are mediated by the type I IGF receptor a cell surface receptor comprising two α and two β subunits (9.Ullrich A. Gray A. Tam A.W. Yang-Feng T. Tsubokawa M.

Binding of the growth factor activates tyrosine kinase activity in the C terminus of the β subunit. The activated tyrosine kinase of the receptor then phosphorylates a number of intracelluar signaling molecules, of which insulin receptor substrate 1 (10.Myers M.G. Sun X.J. White M.F.

We originally proposed that the increased response could result from increased expression of the type I IGF receptor (7.Stewart A.J. Johnson M.D. May F.E.B. Westley B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21172-21178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, experiments in which this receptor was constitutively overexpressed in estrogen-responsive breast cancer cells showed that overexpression did not abrogate estrogen responsiveness (20.Daws M.R. May F.E.B. Westley B.R. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1177-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that the expression of IRS-1, a major substrate for the type I IGF receptor tyrosine kinase, is regulated by estrogens and antiestrogens, whereas other members of the IRS family, IRS-2, -3, and -4, are not. This regulation could be responsible for the increased proliferative response of breast cancer cells to IGFs in the presence of estrogen. MCF-7 (28.Soule H.D. Vasquez J. Long A. Albert S. Brennan M.

Cancer Inst. 1974; 53: 661-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum only. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 4% CO2. In experiments in which the effects of estrogen and/or insulin-like growth factors were measured, cells were first cultured in medium depleted of steroids. This comprised phenol red-free minimal essential medium supplemented with charcoal-treated newborn calf serum and insulin (1 μg/ml). In experiments in which the acute effects of insulin or IGF-I on IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation were examined, cells were incubated with the type I IGF receptor ligand in medium comprising phenol red-free minimal essential medium supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin for the time indicated. 75-cm2 flasks of cells were grown to 70% confluence and then withdrawn from steroids and growth factors by culturing for 6 days in withdrawal medium, as described previously (36.Stewart A.J. Westley B.R. May F.E.B. Br. J. Cancer. 1992; 66: 640-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Medium was changed daily, and cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline before adding the new medium for the first 3 days. Withdrawn cells were treated for 3 days with steroids and/or growth factors in withdrawal medium as required, with a daily change of medium. Total RNA was prepared from cells by homogenization in lithium chloride/urea and extraction in phenol/chloroform. 10 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose/formaldehyde gels. RNA was transferred to Hybond-N nylon membrane by capillary transfer and fixed by baking at 80 °C under vacuum and irradiating with UV light.

Membranes were then extensively washed at 65 °C and exposed to preflashed x-ray film for up to 1 week at −70 °C. Cells were grown to 70% confluence in 35-mm wells, withdrawn for 6 days, and treated for 3 days with growth factors and/or steroids as required. Cell monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% w/v Triton X-100, 0.4 mmNa3VO4, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) on ice for 30 min. The lysate from each well was centrifuged at 12,900 × g (12,000 rpm) for 15 min. The protein concentration of the supernatant was measured by BCA assay. Antibodies against IRS-1, -2, -3, and -4 were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The IRS-1 antibody was raised against the 14 C-terminal amino acids of rat IRS-1, the IRS-2 antibody was raised against amino acids 976–1094 of mouse IRS-2, the IRS-3 antibody was raised against a GST fusion protein containing the N-terminal 120 amino acids of rat IRS-3, and the IRS-4 antibody was raised against amino acids 1240–1257 of human IRS-4. All antibodies were raised in rabbits and were protein A-purified IgG. The IRS-4 antibody was raised against the human sequence, and the IRS-1 and 2 antibodies are known to cross-react with the human protein. The IRS-3 antibody reacted with a protein of correct size (approximately 66 kDa) in MCF-7 cell extracts. 7.5-μg samples of protein were mixed with an equal volume of 2× concentrated SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, boiled, and then electrophoresed on 7% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell). The nitrocellulose filters were incubated in blocking solution (phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat milk and 0.05% Tween-20), and then incubated in 0.2–0.5 μg/ml IRS-1 or 0.5 μg/ml IRS-2, -3, or -4 antibody in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C. The filters were washed thoroughly in water and then incubated for 90 min at room temperature in a 1:3000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit horse radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (DAKO). The filters were then developed using enhanced chemiluminescence. Tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 was measured by immunoprecipitation of IRS-1 following the manufacturer's protocol and Western transfer analysis using the antiphosphotyrosine antibody PY20, again following the manufacturer's protocol. IRS-1 mRNA expression was measured in three estrogen receptor-negative and five estrogen receptor-positive human breast cancer cell lines. The cDNA probe used for the hybridization to total RNA extracted from the cells encompassed the entire coding region of human IRS-1 and detected four major mRNAs of 8.5, 6.9, 6.1, and 4.4 kb (Fig.1). IRS-1 mRNA was detected in all the cell lines apart from BT20, but the levels of expression were extremely variable. For example, MCF-7 cells showed the highest level of expression of all four mRNA, and the level of the 8.5-kb mRNA was more than 10-fold higher than in EFF-3 and MDA-MB 231 cells. Each cell line showed a different pattern of expression of the four transcripts. In MCF-7 and ZR-75 cells, the level of expression of the 8.5-kb transcript was highest, in T47D cells the level of the 6.9-kb transcript was highest, whereas EFM-19 had highest levels of the 6.1-kb transcript. The 4.4-kb mRNA was a minor mRNA in all cell lines in which it was expressed. There was no clear relationship between IRS-1 expression and the estrogen receptor status of the cell lines. However, of the four cell lines that expressed the highest levels of IRS-1 mRNA, three were estrogen receptor-positive. To determine whether the expression of IRS-1 is regulated by estrogen in estrogen-responsive breast cancer cells, IRS-1 mRNA and protein were first measured in MCF-7 cells that had been withdrawn from the effects of estrogen in the routine culture medium and then stimulated with estradiol. A large decrease in IRS-1 mRNA expression was observed in MCF-7 cells after 3 days of culture in steroid-free medium (data not shown). To investigate whether this decrease was attributable to the withdrawal of the cells from the estrogen present in the routine culture medium, MCF-7 cells were withdrawn by culturing for 3 days in steroid-free medium and then treated for times varying from 4 h to 6 days with 10−9m estradiol. RNA was then extracted for the measurement IRS-1 mRNA expression. From the autoradiograph shown in Fig. 2 A, it is clear that there is a dramatic induction in the levels of IRS-1 mRNA by estradiol and that the effect is visible after only 4 h treatment. The intensity of hybridization was quantified by scanning densitometry (Fig. 2 B), which showed that IRS-1 mRNA levels were increased more than 2-fold after only 4 h of estradiol treatment and continued to increase with time so that after 4 days IRS-1 mRNA levels were more than 20-fold higher in estrogen treated compared with control cells. IRS-1 mRNA levels started to plateau between 4 and 6 days. To determine whether estradiol induced a similar increase in IRS-1 protein expression, the above experiment was repeated, the cells were lysed, and the IRS-1 protein in the lysates was measured. As shown in Fig. 2 C, IRS-1 protein was undetectable in withdrawn cells, was first detected after 16 h of estrogen treatment, and then continued to increase during 4–5 days of treatment. Compared with the mRNA induction by estradiol, there appeared to be a lag before IRS-1 protein was detected. It was not possible to quantitate the absolute increase in protein levels because of the undetectable amounts of IRS-1 in withdrawn cells, but the increase was more dramatic than the increase in mRNA levels (Fig. 2 D). Three forms of IRS-1 were identified. The highest molecular mass form had an apparent molecular mass of 185 kDa as described by others. The two lower molecular mass forms that were most prominent in cells cultured for 5–6 days in estradiol are presumed to represent degradation products of the 185-kDa form. Cells that had been withdrawn from the effects of estradiol in the routine cell culture medium were then stimulated with various concentrations of estradiol for 3 days to determine the concentration required to induce IRS-1 mRNA and protein (Fig.3). IRS-1 mRNAs were induced coordinately and were induced by the lowest concentration of estradiol tested (Fig. 3 A). Maximal induction was observed with concentrations of 10−10m estradiol and higher. The induction of IRS-1 protein showed a similar dose response curve to that of the mRNA with low levels of IRS-1 being detected at 10−13 and 10−12m estradiol and maximal induction occurring at 10−10mestradiol and higher (Fig. 3 B). These dose response experiments therefore showed that the induction of both IRS-1 mRNA and protein was very sensitive to estradiol consistent with this effect being mediated by the estrogen receptor. The two lower molecular mass forms of IRS-1 were less apparent in this experiment, which is consistent with the protein profile seen in time course experiment after 3 days of estradiol treatment. The ability of the antiestrogens to induce the expression of IRS-1 mRNA and to inhibit the induction by estrogen in MCF-7 cells was then examined. Tamoxifen is widely used in the treatment of breast cancer, and although it inhibits the effects of estradiol, it has partial estrogen agonist activity for most estrogen responses measured in breast cancer cells. Cells were withdrawn and then treated for 3 days with various concentrations of tamoxifen alone or in the presence of 2 × 10−10m estradiol, a concentration that induces IRS-1 mRNA to maximal levels. Tamoxifen alone had negligible estrogen agonist activity over a wide range of concentrations (10−10–10−5m) but inhibited the induction of IRS-1 mRNA by 2 × 10−10 at concentrations above 10−7m. The concentration of tamoxifen required for half maximal inhibition was approximately 10−6m (Fig.4). ICI 182,780 is currently being evaluated for the treatment of breast cancer (38.DeFriend D.J. Howell A. Nicholson R.I. Anderson E. Dowsett M. Mansel R.E. Blamey R.W. Bundred N.J. Robertson J.F. Saunders C. Baum M. Walton P. Sutcliffe F. Wakeling A.E. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 408-414PubMed Google Scholar) and has been reported to have little or no estrogen agonist activity. Cells were withdrawn and treated for 3 days with various concentrations of ICI 182,780 tamoxifen alone or in the presence of 2 × 10−10m estradiol. ICI 182,780 alone also had negligible estrogen agonist activity over a wide range of concentrations (10−10–10−5m) but was somewhat more potent than tamoxifen in inhibiting the induction of IRS-1 by estradiol. ICI 182,780 inhibited the induction of IRS-1 mRNA at concentrations above 10−9m, and the concentration required for half-maximal inhibition was approximately 7 × 10−9m. The concentrations of the two antiestrogens required to inhibit the induction of IRS-1 were consistent with the known antiestrogenic potencies of these two estrogen antagonists. Both tamoxifen and ICI 182,780 also inhibited the induction of IRS-1 protein levels by estradiol (data not shown). If the enormously increased amounts of IRS-1 protein present in estradiol-stimulated cells are activated in the presence of the ligands that use this docking protein to transduce their signal, then the high levels of IRS-1 protein may contribute to the increased proliferation induced by ligands in the presence of estradiol. The amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 was therefore measured in cells grown under the conditions used in cell proliferation assays. Cells were cultured in withdrawal medium for 6 days and then in withdrawal medium alone or in the presence of estradiol or insulin alone and cells grown in the presence of estradiol and insulin together for 3 days. Cell lysate was prepared from the cells, IRS-1 was immunoprecipitated, and its tyrosine phosphorylation was assessed by Western transfer analysis (Fig.5 A). Cells that had been withdrawn from the effects of estrogen in the routine culture medium had no detectable tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 either in the absence or presence of insulin (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, large amounts of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 were detected in cells that had been grown in medium containing estradiol and insulin. Importantly, cells grown in medium containing estradiol but lacking insulin showed similar low levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 to cells that had been grown in medium lacking both estradiol and insulin. To demonstrate that insulin or IGF-I is directly responsible for the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in the experiment shown in Fig. 5 A, MCF-7 cells were grown in the presence of estradiol and then treated for 5 min with insulin or IGF-I. No tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 was detected in unstimulated cells, but both insulin and IGF-I caused a similar large induction of IRS-1 phosphorylation in these estrogen-stimulated cells. The concentrations of the two ligands used in this experiment are consistent with this effect being mediated by the type I IGF receptor (Fig.5 B). IRS-1 belongs to family of related molecules including IRS-2 (39.Sun X.J. Wang L.-M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Myers M.G. Glasheen E. Lane W.S. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), IRS-3 (40.Lavan B.E. Fantin V.R. Chang E.T. Lane W.S. Keller S.R. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11439-11443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), and IRS-4 (41.Fantin V.R. Sparling J.D. Slot J.W. Keller S.R. Lienhard G.E. Lavan B.E. J. Biol.

The effects of estrogen on IRS-2, -3, and -4 levels in MCF-7 cells were therefore investigated to determine whether the effects of estrogen were specific for IRS-1 or involved other members of this family of proteins. Fig.6 shows a representative Western transfer of control and estrogen-stimulated cells reacted with IRS-1, -2, -3, and -4 antibodies together with a histogram showing the results for three separate experiments. The IRS-2 antibody reacted with a protein of approximately 180 kDa, and the IRS-3 antibody reacted with a protein of 66 kDa. These sizes are consistent with those reported in the literature for these proteins. The IRS-4 antibody reacted predominantly with proteins of 130 and 97 kDa. Two minor proteins of 93 and 100 kDa were also identified, and longer exposures of the filter shown in Fig.6 also revealed a protein of 160 kDa. Immunoprecipitation of IRS-3 and IRS-4 from cell lysates of control or IGF-I-treated MCF-7 cells and immunoblotting with antiphosphotyrosine antibody failed to demonstrate that these proteins were tyrosine-phosphorylated or that tyrosine phosphorylation could be induced by IGF-I. We therefore conclude that although IRS-3 and -4 are expressed in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, they are not tyrosine-phosphorylated by the type I IGF receptor in response to IGF-I. IRS-1 was induced approximately 100-fold in this experiment, whereas IRS-2 and -3 and none of the forms of IRS-4 were induced significantly by estradiol. These experiments show that of the members of the IRS family analyzed, only IRS-1 levels are significantly regulated by estradiol. Changes in the structure, function, and expression of intracellular signaling molecules have been implicated in the aberrant control of cell proliferation resulting in malignant transformation. The intracellular signaling pathways involved in the control of breast cancer cell proliferation are not known, although alterations to a number of different signaling molecules have been reported. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the responsiveness of breast cancer cells to estrogen is clinically important given the incidence of the disease and the widespread use of hormonal manipulation to control the progression of the disease by abrogating the effects of estrogens. A number of laboratories have focussed on the involvement of the IGF signal transduction pathway and have shown: (i) that breast cancer cells are responsive to the proliferative effects of IGFs, (ii) that a number of components of the IGF signal transduction pathway can be regulated by estrogen including IGF-II (21.Yee D.

Chem. 1990; 265: 21172-21178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and (iii) that estrogens control the proliferative response of cells to IGFs (6.Thorsen T. Lahooti R. Rasmussen M.

In this study we report that estrogens regulate the expression of IRS-1, a major substrate of the type I IGF receptor tyrosine kinase, and suggest that this regulation may be responsible for mediating the effects of estrogen on breast cancer cell proliferation. No previous studies have analyzed IRS-1 mRNA in breast cancer cells. Four major mRNAs were identified of 8.5, 6.9, 6.1, and 4.4 kb in MCF-7 cells. mRNAs of 6 and 6.9 kb have been reported previously in a variety of human tissues (skeletal muscle, heart, and brain) (37.Araki E. Sun X.-J. Haag B.L.I. Chuang L.-M. Zhang Y. Yang-Feng T.L. White M.F. Kahn C.R. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1041-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 43.Sun X.J. Crimmins D.L. Myers Jr., M.G. Miralpeix M. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7418-7428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), mRNAs of 9 and 6 kb have been found in human pancreas and a variety of cell lines (44.Bergmann U. Funatomi H. Kornmann M. Beger H.G. Kore M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 886-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and a single mRNA of 5 kb has been found in normal human liver and hepatocellular carcinoma (45.Nishiyama M. Wands J.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The reasons for the differences in the sizes of the mRNAs is not known but may result, at least in part, from multiple transcription start points as has been observed for mouse IRS-1 mRNA (46.Araki E. Haag B.L. Matsuda K. Schichiri M. Kahn C.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1367-1379PubMed Google Scholar). The majority of published studies of IRS-1 protein in breast cancer cells present illustrations which showing the 185-kDa form only (27.Rocha R.L. Hilsenbeck S.G. Jackson J.G. Yee D. Clinical Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 103-109PubMed Google Scholar,47.Guvakova M.A. Surmacz E. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2606-2610PubMed Google Scholar), and it is not possible to evaluate whether other forms were observed. We consistently observed lower molecular mass forms that we presume to be degradation products e.g. Fig. 2. The degradation pathway of IRS-1 is not known, but the identification of well defined intermediates suggests that there may be specific degradation pathways. Because the role of IRS-1 is to act as a docking protein that assembles signaling complexes, IRS-1 degradation may be an important way of regulating IRS-1 signaling. IRS-1 contains PEST sequences and is a substrate for the calcium-dependent protease calpain. Whether, the lower molecular mass forms of IRS-1 seen in this study reflect calpain digestion, however, remains to be established. IRS-1 levels were highly regulated by estrogen in MCF-7 cells, and, overall, the dose response curve for the induction of IRS-1 by estradiol and the concentrations of the two antiestrogens, tamoxifen and ICI 182,780, required to inhibit the effects of estradiol are consistent with this effect being mediated by the estrogen receptor. Although tamoxifen is generally considered to be a partial estrogen agonist, we observed no estrogen agonist activity of tamoxifen on IRS-1 expression. It is recognized, however, that the estrogen agonist activity of tamoxifen varies with the response being measured (48.May F.E.B. Westley B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15894-15899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that estrogen-responsive genes have been identified that are induced minimally by tamoxifen (49.May F.E.B. Westley B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12901-12908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results are, at first sight, in contrast to those of Guvakova and Surmacz (47.Guvakova M.A. Surmacz E. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2606-2610PubMed Google Scholar) who reported that tamoxifen, although reducing the amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1, had no effect on IRS-1 protein levels in MCF-7 breast cancer. Our results are, however, consistent with those of Guvakova and Surmacz (47.Guvakova M.A. Surmacz E. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2606-2610PubMed Google Scholar) in that we found no estrogen agonist or antagonist effect of tamoxifen at the concentration used in their study (10 nm). We did find, however, that higher concentrations of tamoxifen inhibit the induction of IRS-1 by estradiol. The main impetus for studying the effect of estradiol on IRS-1 expression was to explain how estrogens can increase the response of estrogen-responsive breast cancer cell lines to IGFs. Although IGFs alone stimulate the proliferation of breast cancer cells, the stimulation is markedly increased by estrogen in hormone-responsive breast cancer cells (6.Thorsen T. Lahooti R. Rasmussen M. Aakvaag A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 41: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 7.Stewart A.J. Johnson M.D. May F.E.B. Westley B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21172-21178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Van Der Berg B. Rutteman G.R. Blankenstein M.A. De Laat S.W. Van Zoelen E.J.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 134: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Binding studies and dose response experiments had suggested that the increased responsiveness was mediated via the type-I IGF receptor, and experiments in breast cancer cells and other cell types had suggested that estrogens can increase the proliferative response to insulin-like growth factors by increasing type I IGF receptor levels (7.Stewart A.J. Johnson M.D. May F.E.B. Westley B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21172-21178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate this hypothesis, Daws et al. (20.Daws M.R. May F.E.B. Westley B.R. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1177-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) used a retroviral expression vector to produce MCF-7 cells that constitutively overexpressed the type-I IGF receptor. The cells overexpressing the type-I IGF receptor showed the same magnitude of response to IGF-I as the parental cells, suggesting that the level of the type I IGF receptor does not control the response of breast cancer cells to IGFs. In addition, estrogen increased the response of both the parental and transfected cells to IGFs, confirming that the increased response of MCF-7 cells to IGFs in the presence of estradiol does not result from the induction of the receptor by estradiol. The results of the present study provide an alternative explanation for the increased response of breast cancer cells to IGFs in the presence of estrogen. We have shown that IRS-1 is induced by estrogen and suggest that the induction of IRS-1 by estrogen could account for the increased response to IGFs in the presence of this steroid. Although not examining the estrogen regulation of IRS-1 expression by estradiol, the data of Surmacz and Burgaud (50.Surmacz E. Burgaud J.-L. Clinical Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 1429-1436PubMed Google Scholar) are consistent with this model. Surmacz and Burgaud derived MCF-7 clones overexpressing IRS-1 and showed a loss of estrogen dependence for growth. They also showed that IRS-1 antisense oligonucleotides completely inhibited the growth of normal MCF-7 cells as well as cells overexpressing IRS-1, again emphasizing the importance of this protein in estrogen-responsive cell proliferation. Estrogen regulation of other downstream signaling molecules apart from IRS-1 may also be involved in mediating the effects of estrogen on the responsiveness of cells to IGFs. Although we have not analyzed all signaling molecules in this pathway, we investigated the effect of estrogen on three other members of the IRS family. The lack of effect of estrogen on IRS-2, -3, and 4 suggests that estrogen mediates its effects by regulating a limited repertoire of signaling molecules, and the magnitude of the induction of IRS-1 suggests that this molecule may be very important in mediating the effects of estrogen on the responsiveness of these cells to IGFs. The importance of IRS-1 in mediating the effects of IGFs and estradiol suggests that measurement of IRS-1 expression may be of clinical importance in predicting the proliferative behavior of breast tumors. There has been only one study to date (27.Rocha R.L. Hilsenbeck S.G. Jackson J.G. Yee D. Clinical Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 103-109PubMed Google Scholar) on the prognostic value of IRS-1 expression in breast cancer, and this measured total IRS-1, rather than tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1, in a series of 195 node-negative primary cancers. Consistent with the view that IRS-1 expression is regulated by estrogen, IRS-1 expression was positively correlated with estrogen receptor levels. Importantly, IRS-1 expression was associated with a poor prognosis, and this was most pronounced in small tumors. Although these findings are consistent with the view that IRS-1 is an important molecule in breast cancer cell growth, a stronger association may have been found if phosphorylated IRS-1,i.e. the active form of IRS-1, had been measured, because this may more accurately reflect the activity of the estrogen/IGF pathways.

Two groups have recently reported the isolation of histone deacetylase core complexes (mSin3 and the NuRD complex) that are critically involved in this transcriptional repression (8.Laherty C.D. Billin A.N. Lavinsky R.M. Yochum G.S. Bush A.C. Sun J.M. Mullen T.M. Davie J.R. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Ayer D.E. Eisenman R.N. Mol.

A few components of the NuRD complex are also present in the mSin3 complex that consists of seven polypeptides. In particular, SAP30 directly interacts with N-CoR, although N-CoR does not appear to be stably associated with this mSin3 complex. Antibody-blocking experiments and studies with histone deacetylase inhibitors also supported the idea that N-CoR/SMRT may serve as an adapter molecule between the core mSin3 complex and sequence-specific transcriptional repressors such as unliganded nuclear receptors (8.Laherty C.D. Billin A.N. Lavinsky R.M. Yochum G.S. Bush A.C. Sun J.M. Mullen T.M. Davie J.R. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Ayer D.E. Eisenman R.N. Mol.

However, recent evidence also showed that N-Cor/SMRT and Sin3 directly interact with the key components of the transcriptional initiation process (TFIIB, and the TBP-associating factors) to inhibit basal transcription, suggesting an alternative repression pathway (10.Wong C.W.

Interestingly, the N-CoR·Sin3·HDAC complex is also known to mediate transcriptional repression from a wide variety of other nonreceptor-mediated pathways. These include MyoD (12.Bailey P. Downes M.

Serum response factor (SRF), activating protein-1 (AP-1), and nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) are known to control a surprisingly diverse set of genes. However, these factors have been shown to share at least one common property, i.e. stimulation of cellular proliferation processes. Along with ternary complex factor, SRF binds to and activates the serum response element (SRE). The SRE sequences are found in the upstream regulatory sequences of myogenic genes as well as a number of immediate early genes, including c-fos, which in turn activate genes critical for cell proliferation (for a review see Ref. 17.Treisman R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1990; 1: 47-58PubMed Google Scholar). SRF belongs to the MADS box family of proteins and recognizes a CArG box in the SRE, whereas the ternary complex factor does not bind autonomously to the element but requires the assistance of SRF to efficiently contact the DNA. The AP-1 complex, immediate early response genes, consists of a heterodimer of a Fos family member and a Jun family member (for a review see Ref. 19.Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5615) Google Scholar). This complex binds the consensus DNA sequence (TGAGTCA) (termed AP-1 sites) found in a variety of promoters. The Fos family contains four proteins (c-Fos, Fos-B, Fra-1, and Fra-2), whereas the Jun family is composed of three (c-Jun, Jun-B, and Jun-D). Fos and Jun are members of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family of sequence-specific dimeric DNA-binding proteins. The C-terminal half of the bZIP domain is amphipathic, containing a heptad repeat of leucines that is critical for the dimerization of bZIP proteins. The N-terminal half of the long bipartite helix is the basic region that is critical for sequence-specific DNA binding. Finally, NFκB is composed of homo- and heterodimeric complexes of members of the Rel (NFκB) family of polypeptides (for a review see Ref. 19.Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5615) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, this family comprises p50, p65 (RelA), c-Rel, p52 and RelB. These proteins share a 300-amino acid region, known as the Rel homology domain, which binds to DNA and mediates homo- and heterodimerization. This domain is also a target of the IκB inhibitors, which include IκBα, IκBβ, IκBγ, Bcl-3, p105, and p100. In the majority of cells, NFκB exists in an inactive form in the cytoplasm bound to the inhibitory IκB proteins. Treatment of cells with various inducers results in the degradation of IκB proteins, and the bound NFκB is released and translocates to the nucleus, where it activates appropriate target genes. Interestingly, a naturally occurring splice variant of RelA was shown to transform Rat-1 cells (20.Narayanan R. Klement J.F. Ruben S.M. Higgins K.A. Rosen C.A. Science. 1992; 256: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), whereas antisense oligonucleotides to RelA were shown to inhibit proliferation and tumorigenicity of several tumor cell lines, including the human breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and T47D (21.Higgins K.A. Perez J.R. Coleman T.A. Dorshkind K. McComas W.A. Sarmiento U.M. Rosen C.A. Narayanan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9901-9905Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In addition, activation of NFκB through the disruption of IκBα regulation was shown to result in malignant transformation (22.Beauparlant P. Kwan I. Bitar R. Chou P. Koromilas A.E. Sonenberg N. Hiscott J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3189-3197PubMed Google Scholar). From these results, it was suggested that constitutive activation of NFκB contributes to the malignant phenotype of tumor cells. Herein, we report our findings that SMRT physically interacts with SRF, AP-1, and NFκB and inhibits their transactivations via recruitment of Sin3·HDACs. Thus, SMRT may play a critical role in the cellular proliferation control or other functions of these transcription factorsin vivo. TSA was obtained from Sigma. EGY48 cells, the lexA-β-galactosidase reporter construct, and the LexA and B42-parental vectors (i.e. pJG4–5 and p202PL) were as reported (23.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar).

Expression vectors for Gal4 fusions to c-Fos and SMRT, VP16 fusions to p50, p65, c-Jun, c-Fos, and SRF, and B42 fusions to SRFΔC, SRFΔN, p65ΔC, and p65ΔN were constructed by inserting appropriate polymerase chain reaction fragments into EcoRI andXhoI restriction sites of pCMXGal4/N, pCMXVP16, and pJG4–5, respectively. Similarly, polymerase chain reaction fragments of the full-length SMRT and its various fragments were cloned intoEcoRI and XhoI restriction sites of pcDNA3, p202PL, and pGEX4T for T7 in vitro transcription, LexA fusions, and GST fusions, respectively. The cotransformation and β-galactosidase assays in yeast were performed as described (23.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). For each experiment, at least three independently derived colonies expressing chimeric proteins were tested. The GST-fusions or GST alone were expressed in Escherichia coli, bound to glutathione-Sepahrose-4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and incubated with labeled proteins expressed by in vitrotranslation by using the TNT-coupled transcription-translation system, with conditions as described by the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI). Specifically bound proteins were eluted from beads with 40 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography as described (23.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). Various mammalian cells were grown in 24-well plates with medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. After 24 h of incubation, cells were transfected with 100 ng of β-galactosidase expression vector pRSV-β-gal and 100 ng of an indicated reporter gene, along with various mammalian expression vectors. Total amounts of expression vectors were kept constant by adding decreasing amounts of pcDNA3 to transfections. 12 h later, cells were washed and refed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum either in the presence or absence of 100 nm TSA and harvested 24 h later for luciferase activity. With the serum-responsive SRE-c-fos-LUC and c-fos-LUC reporters, however, the transfected cells were incubated with medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum for 20 h and washed and refed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal calf serum either in the presence or absence of 100 nm TSA. Cells were harvested 4 h later and measured for luciferase activity, as described (24.Kim H.-J. Kim J.H. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28564-28567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). All of the results were normalized to the LacZ expression, and similar results were obtained in more than two similar experiments. In our recent studies of various transcription coactivators and corepressors, we found that coexpression of SMRT consistently inhibited transactivation by a Gal4 fusion to the NFκB component p65 or the AP-1 component c-Fos in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1). Similar results were also obtained with a Gal4 fusion to the NFκB component p50 or the AP-1 component c-Jun, whereas SMRT was not able to repress transactivation by Gal4 alone (results not shown). To confirm these results, SMRT-expression vector was cotransfected into CV1 cells along with a reporter construct (κB)4-IL-2-LUC, which was previously characterized to efficiently mediate the NFκB-dependent transactivations in various cell types and consists of a minimal promoter from the interleukin-2 gene and four upstream κB sites from the interleukin-6 gene (25.Na S.-Y. Lee S.-K. Han S.-J. Choi H.-S. Im S.Y. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10831-10834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Increasing amounts of cotransfected SMRT inhibited the reporter gene expressions in a SMRT dose-dependent manner, with cotransfection of 100 ng of SMRT decreasing the fold activation approximately 5-fold (Fig.2 A). In L929 cells, SMRT also inhibited the tumor necrosis factor α-induced level of transactivations in a SMRT dose-dependent manner (results not shown). In contrast, cotransfection of SMRT did not affect theLacZ reporter expression of the transfection indicator construct pRSV-β-gal either in the presence or absence of tumor necrosis factor α (results not shown). When tested with a reporter construct (TRE)4-TK-LUC, which consists of a minimal promoter from the thymidine kinase gene and four upstream consensus AP-1 sites (26.Lee S.-K. Kim H.-J. Na S.-Y. Kim T.S. Choi H.-S. Im S.Y. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16651-16654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), SMRT inhibited the reporter gene expressions (Fig.2 B). Similarly, SMRT repressed the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced level of transactivations in HeLa and CV-1 cells (results now shown). Serum shock with 20% fetal calf serum resulted in an ∼10-fold increase in transactivation of a reporter construct, SRE-c-fos-LUC, which consists of a minimal promoter from the c-fos gene and a single upstream consensus SRE (24.Kim H.-J. Kim J.H. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28564-28567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, SMRT also repressed this serum-induced level of transactivation by SRF (Fig.2 C). In contrast, SMRT did not affect the TK-LUC reporter expression (Fig. 2 D). Overall, these results strongly suggest that SMRT is a novel transcription corepressor molecule of AP-1, NFκB, and SRF.Figure 2Effects of SMRT cotransfection on the NFκB, AP-1 , and SRF transactivations. CV1 cells were transfected with a LacZ expression vector and an increasing amount of SMRT expression vectors along with various reporter genes as indicated either in the presence or absence of 100 nm TSA. Normalized luciferase expressions from triplicate samples are presented relative to the LacZ expressions and the standard deviations are less than 5%.

Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar, 3.Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). Interestingly, SMRT was not capable of inhibiting the NFκB, AP-1, and SRF transactivations in the presence of 100 nm TSA, a specific HDAC inhibitor (29.Yoshida M. Kijima M. Akita M. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17174-17179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2), whereas TSA was without any significant effect on the basal level of these transcription units (Fig. 2 D and results not shown). In addition, coexpression of HDAC-1 and mSin3A also showed strong repressive effects (Fig. 3). In particular, SMRT·mSin3A·HDAC-1 functionally interacted with SRF in the context of a native c-fos full promoter (Fig.3 C). From these results, we propose that SMRT may specifically recruit the HDAC complexes to NFκB, AP-1, and SRFin vivo to repress their transactivation potential. Finally, it is notable that each reporter construct showed a much higher level of gene expressions in the presence of both activating signals and TSA (Fig. 2, A–C), suggesting that the AP-1, NFκB, and SRF transactivation can be intrinsically compromised by the endogenously expressed SMRT/N-CoR. Therefore, the expression level of endogenous SMRT/N-CoR may serve as an important determinant for the overall transcriptional activities of these transcription factors within a given cell type. To recruit HDACs to AP-1, NFκB, and SRF, SMRT should directly interact with these transcription factors. To examine this possibility, we constructed yeast expression vectors encoding chimeric proteins of the B42 transactivation domain (23.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar) fused to various SMRT fragments (Fig.4 A). SMRT-A, SMRT-B, and SMRT-C did not show any interactions with c-Jun, c-Fos, p50, p65, and SRF in yeast (results now shown). However, SMRT-D consisting of the C-terminal SMRT residues 1060–1495 strongly interacted with c-Jun, c-Fos, SRF, p50, and p65ΔN (i.e. the p65 residues 353–550) (Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, SMRT-D specifically interacted with JunΔ3, FosΔ1, FosΔ2, and SRFΔN (i.e.the SRF residues 203–508) but not with JunΔ1, JunΔ2, FosΔ3, SRFΔC (the SRF residues 1–323), and p65ΔC (the p65 residues 1–323). In particular, JunΔ3 and FosΔ2 contain the previously defined bZIP domains (18.Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar), which also serve as binding sites for the transcription coactivator molecule Bcl-3 (27.Na S.-Y. Choi J.E. Kim H.-J. Jhun B.H. Lee Y.C. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28491-28496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this regard, it is also noted that the C-terminal, SMRT binding regions of SRF and p65 contain their transactivation function (24.Kim H.-J. Kim J.H. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28564-28567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 25.Na S.-Y. Lee S.-K. Han S.-J. Choi H.-S. Im S.Y. Lee J.W. J. Biol.

Similar yeast results were also obtained when tested with LexA fusions to various SMRT fragments and B42 fusions to c-Jun, c-Fos, p50, p65, and SRF (results not shown). These interactions were further confirmed in the mammalian two hybrid tests, in which coexpression of VP16 fusions to p50, p65, c-Jun, c-Fos, and SRF stimulated the Gal4-SMRT-D-mediated transactivations (Fig. 5 A). As previously shown (3.Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar), VP16-TR also showed interactions with Gal4-SMRT-D in the absence of T3.Figure 5Interactions of SMRT with AP-1 , NFκB, and SRF in mammalian cells and in vitro GST-pull downs. A, HeLa cells were transfected with LacZ expression vector, Gal4-SMRT-d-expression vector, and various VP16 fusion vectors along with a reporter gene Gal4-TK-LUC reporter, as indicated. Normalized luciferase expressions from triplicate samples are presented relative to the LacZ expressions, and the standard deviations are less than 5%. B, SMRT, c-Jun, p65, and SRF were labeled with [35S]methionine by in vitrotranslation and incubated with glutathione beads containing GST alone or GST fusions to c-Jun, c-Fos, p50, p65, SRF, and SMRT-D, as indicated. Beads were washed, and specifically bound material was eluted with reduced glutathione and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm these interactions independently, GST alone and GST fusions to c-Jun, c-Fos, p65, p50, and SRF were expressed, purified, and tested for interaction with in vitro translated SMRT. Consistent with the yeast and mammalian two hybrid results, radiolabeled SMRT readily interacted with GST fusions to c-Jun, c-Fos, p50, p65, and SRF but not with GST alone (Fig. 5 B). The radiolabeled c-Jun, c-Fos, p50, p65, and SRF also interacted with GST-SMRT-D but not with GST alone or GST-fusions to SMRT-A, SMRT-B, and SMRT-C (Fig.5 B and results now shown). Overall, these results, along with the yeast and mammalian two hybrid results, indicate that the C-terminal subregion of SMRT directly binds to c-Jun, c-Fos, p50, p65, and SRF. In summary, our results indicate that SMRT physically interacts with and can function as a novel transcription corepressor molecule of AP-1, NFκB, and SRF through recruitment of the HDAC complexes. Because AP-1, NFκB, and SRF are potent mitogenic factors (17.Treisman R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1990; 1: 47-58PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev.

Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5615) Google Scholar), the SMRT-dependent modulation of these transcription factors may contribute to the cellular proliferation control in vivo. Thus, it is an interesting hypothesis that the expression level of endogenous SMRT, as recently evidenced by differential expression levels of SMRT in various cell types (30.Shibata H. Ando T.

Chin W.W. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2493-2500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), could be a key factor determining the overall cellular proliferation capacity of the given cell type. However, SMRT can also modulate other functions of AP-1, NFκB, and SRF (17.Treisman R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1990; 1: 47-58PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev.

In particular, it will be interesting to test whether SRF-mediated activation of MyoD in muscle differentiation (33.Gauthier-Rouviere C. Vandromme M. Tuil D. Lautredou N. Morris M. Soulez M. Kahn A.

Piceatannol, previously reported as a Syk/ZAP70-specific kinase inhibitor, selectively inhibits the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT5, but not of STAT1 and STAT2. This inhibition is paralleled by the loss of Jak1 and IFNAR1 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to IFNα, whereas Tyk2 and IFNAR2 tyrosine phosphorylation is unaffected. Last, the IFNα-induced serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 is not inhibited by piceatannol but is sensitive to the Src kinase-specific inhibitor PP2.

In the case of STAT1 and STAT3, phosphorylation on Ser727 in addition to phosphorylation on Tyr701 or Tyr705, respectively, is essential to maximize their transactivation capabilities (19.Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar). Serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 appears to require MAP kinase activity, and expression of dominant-negative extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 suppresses STAT-mediated gene expression via the IFNα receptor (20.David M. Petricoin III, E.F. Benjamin C. Pine R. Weber M.J. Larner A.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1721-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). The tyrosine kinases required for IFNα/β-mediated STAT activation, Tyk2 and Jak1, were found to be associated with their substrate type I interferon receptor chains, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, respectively (21.Colamonici O.

Genetic deletion of Jak1 results in the inability to respond to IFNα or IFNβ (23.Muller M. Briscoe J. Laxton C. Guschin D. Ziemiecki A. Silvennoinen O. Harpur A.G. Barbieri G.

In contrast, deletion of Tyk2 causes a complete lack of IFNα responsiveness (24.Velazquez L. Fellous M. Stark G.R. Pellegrini S. Cell. 1992; 70: 313-322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), whereas IFNβ can still elicit a limited signaling response in the absence of Tyk2 (25.Pellegrini S. John J. Shearer M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4605-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), albeit both interferons utilize the same receptor. Studies aimed at elucidating the function of these kinases as well as their transphosphorylation and their role in receptor phosphorylation have been complicated by the fact that the absence of Tyk2 causes a significant decrease in the expression levels and in the function of the type I interferon receptor (26.Gauzzi M.C.

Interestingly, a kinase-defective Tyk2 mutant is able to partially restore sensitivity toward IFNα (27.Gauzzi M.C. Velazquez L. McKendry R. Mogensen K.E. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20494-20500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 28.Velazquez L. Mogensen K.E. Barbieri G. Fellous M. Uze G. Pellegrini S. J. Biol.

Much of the work on type I interferon receptor signaling focused on the activation of STAT1 and -2, which comprise the ISGF3 transactivation complex. However, IFNα/β are also able to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and -5, albeit the target genes of these STAT proteins remain to be elucidated. Here we report that the tyrosine kinase inhibitor piceatannol selectively prevents the IFNα-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and -5, as well as of Jak1 and IFNAR1. In contrast, the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and -2 and of Tyk2 and IFNAR2 was unaffected by the inhibitor, as was IFNα-induced serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and -3 and subsequent ISG induction. Furthermore, we show that the serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and -3 requires extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 as well as the activity of a Src-like tyrosine kinase. Ramos and Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum,l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. ZAP70-deficient Jurkat cells were a kind gift from Dr. Robert Abraham. Piceatannol, PP2, and PD98059 were obtained from Calbiochem. Staurosporine was purchased from Sigma. IFNα was a generous gifts from Hoffman LaRoche. Following treatment, cells were lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were centrifuged, and protein concentration was determined by Bradford (Bio-Rad). Whole cell extracts or immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and adsorbed to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.). Proteins were detected with phosphospecific STAT1-Tyr701, STAT3-Tyr705 and Tyk2-Tyr1054/Tyr1055 from New England Biolabs, or with phosphospecific STAT1-Ser727, phospho-specific STAT5A/B-Tyr694/Tyr699), or phosphotyrosine-specific (4G10-Biotin Conjugate) antisera purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Monoclonal antibodies to IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 were generous gifts from Biogen, Inc. and Dr. O. Colamonici, respectively. Jak1 and phosphospecific (Tyr698) STAT2 rabbit antiserum were generous gifts from Dr. Andrew Larner. Monoclonal Jak1 antibody from Transduction Laboratories was used for reprobing. All blots were developed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Jurkat cells were stimulated with IFNα in the absence or presence of piceatannol. Total cellular RNA was isolated with TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). 32P- Labeled antisense riboprobes were generated byin vitro transcription of the linearized plasmid using T7 or SP6 RNA polymerases (Promega). Labeled riboprobe and 10 μg of RNA were incubated in hybridization buffer (4:1 formamide and 5× stock; 5× stock was 200 mm PIPES, pH 6.4, 2 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA), overnight at 56 °C before digestion with T1 RNase (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 1 h at 37 °C. After phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, protected fragments were solubilized in RNA loading buffer (98% formamide, 10 mm EDTA (pH 8), bromphenol blue, xylene cyanol), boiled for 2 min, and subjected to electrophoresis on a 4.5% polyacrylamide-urea gel. IFNα can activate several members of the STAT family of transcription factors. This poses the interesting question of whether all STAT proteins are activated by the same mechanism, particularly since the activation kinetics differs between distinct STAT proteins. As such, IFNα induces in RAMOS cells, a Burkitt lymphoma B cell line, maximal phosphorylation of STAT1 Tyr701 and STAT3 Tyr705 within 30 min after stimulation. However, whereas Tyr705-phosphorylated STAT3 is subjected to a rapid decrease within 2 h, Tyr701-phosphorylated STAT1 can still be observed after 24 h (Fig. 1 A,upper versus lower panel). This differential regulation of STAT tyrosine phosphorylation could be due to different kinase activity or could be based on selective dephosphorylation and/or degradation. To address this question, cells were stimulated with IFNα for 30 min prior to exposure to staurosporine, a general kinase inhibitor, for the indicated times. This pulse-chase type stimulation revealed that the tyrosine phosphorylation state of STAT1 is similar to that of STAT3 (Fig.1 B, upper versus lower panel), suggesting that different tyrosine kinases rather than phosphatases are responsible for the observed differences in the phosphorylation profile. We had observed previously that piceatannol, a reportedly Syk/ZAP70-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is able to block tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 after B cell receptor stimulation (30.Su, L., Rickert, R., and David, M. (1999) 274, 31770–31774Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found piceatannol to also selectively inhibit IFNα-mediated STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was not affected (Fig.2 A, upper versus lower panel). In contrast, PP2, an inhibitor of Src and Src-like kinases, did not affect IFNα-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of either STAT1 or STAT3 (Fig.2 B, lanes 4 and 5). To further investigate the specificity of piceatannol, its inhibitory effect on tyrosine phosphorylation of the other STAT proteins was examined. As shown in Fig. 2 C, IFNα-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5A/B is also abrogated by piceatannol, while STAT2 parallels STAT1 in being unaffected by the inhibitor in its phosphorylation (top panels versus bottom panels). Similar results were obtained in HeLa cells or primary human foreskin fibroblasts, illustrating that the effects of piceatannol are not restricted to cells of hematopoietic origin (data not shown). These results demonstrate that STAT3 and -5 activation requires a piceatannol-sensitive kinase, whereas STAT1 and STAT2 activation occurs through a different mechanism. To exclude the possibility that the observed effects of piceatannol were a peculiarity of the RAMOS cell line, we also subjected Jurkat T cells to IFNα stimulation in the absence or presence of piceatannol. Identical to RAMOS cells, piceatannol specifically blocked STAT3 but not STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation after IFN stimulation (Fig.3 A, upper versus lower panel). Selective gene activation responsible for the different biological responses can be attributed to differential STAT dimer binding or dimer-complex formation on the DNA. IFNα-activated STAT1 and -2, which comprise the IFNα/β-induced interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) binding complex, bind to ISREs to drive transcription of ISGs. Alternatively, STAT1 homodimers are able to stimulate transcription of genes controlled by the IFNγ-activated sequence. Since we had found that STAT1 and -2 were unaffected by piceatannol, we wanted to verify that the downstream transcriptional activation of ISRE-driven genes is indeed not inhibited by piceatannol. We therefore performed RNase protection assays using a probe corresponding to the humanISG54 gene with RNA derived from Jurkat cells stimulated with IFNα in the absence and presence of piceatannol. As anticipated, IFNα-mediated transcription of ISG54 was not effected by the inhibitor (Fig. 3 B). In addition, the induction of the IFNγ-activated sequence element-driven IRF1 gene was also not affected by piceatannol (Fig. 3 C). Thus, piceatannol is able to prevent IFNα-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and -5 without affecting transcriptional activation of STAT1-controlled IFNγ-activated sequence-driven or STAT1/2-stimulated ISRE-driven genes. Piceatannol has been reported to specifically inhibit the Syk/ZAP70 kinase family members (31.Oliver J.M. Burg D.L. Wilson B.S. McLaughlin J.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29697-29703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Peters J.D. Furlong M.T. Asai D.J. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4755-4762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To test whether Syk/ZAP70 are indeed the targets of piceatannol in the IFNα-activated STAT activation pathway, we utilized a ZAP70-deficient Jurkat variant. These cells, which also do not express detectable levels of Syk kinase (33.Williams B.L. Schreiber K.L. Zhang W. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Leibson P.J. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1388-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), were still able to support STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation; moreover, the selective sensitivity of STAT3 toward piceatannol was still preserved (Fig. 3 D, upper versus lower panel). These results clearly demonstrate that Syk/ZAP70 are not involved in IFNα-mediated STAT1 or -3 activation. The current model of signaling through the IFNα/β receptor supports the notion that the tyrosine kinases Tyk2 and Jak1 associate with IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, respectively (21.Colamonici O. Yan H. Domanski P. Handa R. Smalley D. Mullersman J. Witte M. Krishnan K. Krolewski J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8133-8142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Domanski P. Fish E. Nadeau O.W. Witte M.

Upon IFN-induced receptor dimerization, transphosphorylation of the two associated tyrosine kinases occurs (27.Gauzzi M.C. Velazquez L. McKendry R. Mogensen K.E. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20494-20500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and the kinases thus activated subsequently phosphorylate tyrosine residues on the cytoplasmic tails of the receptor chains. This receptor phosphorylation is thought to be required for STAT binding to the receptors via the STAT-SH2 domains (14.Gupta S. Yan H. Wong L.H. Ralph S. Krolewski J. Schindler C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1075-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Since we had excluded Syk/ZAP70 as the target for piceatannol, we decided to investigate the effect of the compound on the tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 and Tyk2 tyrosine kinase. Intriguingly, IFNα-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1, but not the phosphorylation of the tyrosines in the activation loop of Tyk2, is blocked by piceatannol (Fig.4 A, upper versus middle panel). Immunoblots were reprobed for Jak1 and Tyk2 to verify that equal amounts of proteins were loaded (data not shown). Since Jak1 and Tyk2 have been shown to transphosphorylate each other for activation (23.Muller M. Briscoe J. Laxton C. Guschin D. Ziemiecki A. Silvennoinen O. Harpur A.G. Barbieri G. Withuhn B.A. Schindler C. Pellegrini S. Wilks A.F. Ihle J.N. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Nature. 1993; 366: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 27.Gauzzi M.C. Velazquez L. McKendry R. Mogensen K.E. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20494-20500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), the lack of Jak1, but not Tyk2, phosphorylation is probably due to specific inhibition of Tyk2 kinase activity. Interestingly, Tyk2 has been reported to share a significant degree of homology with Syk (27.Gauzzi M.C. Velazquez L. McKendry R. Mogensen K.E. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20494-20500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), which offers a possible explanation for its sensitivity toward piceatannol. Indeed, Tyk2 displayed a higher sensitivity than Jak1 toward inhibition by piceatannol in in vitro kinase assays (data not shown). Tyk2 inhibition would be expected to be accompanied by the absence of IFNAR1 tyrosine phosphorylation, since this receptor chain functions as a substrate for Tyk2 (21.Colamonici O. Yan H. Domanski P. Handa R. Smalley D. Mullersman J. Witte M. Krishnan K. Krolewski J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8133-8142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, intact phosphorylation of the Jak1 substrate IFNAR2 would be anticipated if this kinase is not inhibited by piceatannol. Indeed, piceatannol prevented the IFNα-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IFNAR1 (Fig. 4 A,second panel from bottom) but not of IFNAR2 (bottom panel), as detected by receptor immunoprecipitation followed by phosphotyrosine blotting. The blot was reprobed for IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 to ensure equal amounts of immunoprecipitated receptors (data not shown). Interestingly, reprobing of the blot for STAT3 revealed that the inhibition of IFNAR1 tyrosine phosphorylation did not impair STAT3 binding to IFNAR1. Rather, STAT3 was found to be constitutively associated with this IFNα receptor chain (Fig. 4 B), whereas probing of immunoprecipitates obtained with NRS revealed no STAT3 (data not shown). These results suggest that the catalytic kinase activity of Tyk2 is essential for the activation of STAT3 and STAT5 but is dispensable in the activation of STAT1 and STAT2. Furthermore, tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail of IFNAR1 appears not to be essential for the recruitment of STAT3 to the receptor. In addition to tyrosine phosphorylation, which mediates nuclear translocation and DNA binding of STATs, additional serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and -3 is necessary for maximal transcriptional activation (19.Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar). Tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of STAT1 occur with different kinetics. IFNα-mediated STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation is detectable within 5 min after stimulation, while observable serine phosphorylation does not occur until 30 min after treatment (Fig. 5 A). Subsequently, serine phosphorylation of STAT1 is still maximal after a 24-h exposure to interferon, while STAT1 Tyr701phosphorylation is markedly diminished. As described previously, serine phosphorylation on STAT1 Ser727 is dependent on extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activity, and PD98059, a potent mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor, abrogated STAT1 Ser727phosphorylation (Fig. 5, lanes 7 and8). To investigate whether the serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and -3 was affected by either piceatannol or PP2, we analyzed the serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and -3 in response to IFNα in the absence or presence of these inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 5, piceatannol had no effect on the IFNα-induced serine phosphorylation of STAT1 (lanes 5 and 6); however, STAT1 Ser727 phosphorylation was significantly diminished in the presence of the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 (lanes 3 and 4) at a concentration that did not affect STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2 B). Identical results were obtained when STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation was analyzed (data not shown). Thus, distinct requirements exist that govern the processes that lead to STAT tyrosine or serine phosphorylation. In summary, our data indicate that the tyrosine phosphorylation of different STAT proteins, although initiated through the same IFNα receptor complex, is regulated by distinct mechanisms. We have shown that STAT3 and -5 can be included in a piceatannol-sensitive group, while activation of STAT1 and -2 is unaltered by this tyrosine kinase inhibitor. We provide evidence suggesting that Tyk2 kinase activity is required for STAT3 activation but is dispensable for tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1. Furthermore, the lack of tyrosine phosphorylation on the cytoplasmic tail of IFNAR1 does not preclude STAT3 recruitment, since the protein is found constitutively associated with the receptor chain. Our data demonstrate the feasibility of the development of compounds that specifically abrogate the activation of selected members of the Jak/STAT pathway. STAT1 activation is essential for the antiproliferative effects of IFNα (34.Muller M. Laxton C. Briscoe J. Schindler C. Improta T. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. EMBO. 1993; 12: 4221-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), whereas STAT3 has been recently described as an oncogene (35.Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2507) Google Scholar). Thus, selective inhibitors such as piceatannol might prove useful as pharmacological agents to specifically block STAT3 but not STAT1 activation and to modulate cellular responses to type I interferons.

Unesterified cholesterol enters the cell either by the slower LDL1 receptor mediated pathway wherein it leaves the LDL endocytosed within clathrin-coated vesicles prior to vesicle fusion at the lysosome (for review, see Ref.3.Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid. Res. 1997; 38: 1503-1521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by the rapid “alternate” HDL receptor pathway (3.Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid.

Finally, DHE readily incorporates into rat, rabbit, or human VLDL, LDL, and HDL either in vitro (10.Schroeder F. Goh E.H. Heimberg M.

Frolov A. Schoer J. Gallegos A. Atshaves B.P. Stolowich N.J. Scott A.I. Kier A.B. Chang T.Y. Freeman D.A. Intracellular Cholesterol Trafficking. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston1998: 213-234Crossref Google Scholar) and conventional fluorescence microscopy (23.Mukherjee S. Zha X. Tabas I. Maxfield F.R. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1915-1925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) used to directly visualize intracellular DHE distribution in living cells. It was concluded that DHE colocalized with cholesterol in living cells (23.Mukherjee S. Zha X. Tabas I. Maxfield F.R. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1915-1925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). As both these studies pointed out, however, DHE has very significant disadvantages for use in conventional and confocal microscopy in that DHE requires excitation in the UV region (325 nm) of the spectrum where it becomes severely photobleached.In the present investigation the disadvantages of UV excitation for DHE were overcome through the use of multiphoton excitation and multiphoton laser scanning microscopy (MLSM). Furthermore, NBD-cholesterol (NBD-chol) proved to be an alternate fluorescent cholesterol analog to visualize HDL-mediated uptake and intracellular targeting of unesterified cholesterol in L-cell fibroblasts. NBD-chol is absorbed by the intestine of hamsters fed NBD-chol as well as by cultured Caco-2 cells (24.Sparrow C.P. Patel S. Baffic J. Chao Y.-S. Hernandez M. Lam M.-H. Montenegro J. Wright S.D. Detmers P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1747-1757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to DHE, the literature with regard to NBD-chol esterification is more complex. NBD-chol is esterified in vitro by acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase of hamster intestinal microsomes (24.Sparrow C.P. Patel S. Baffic J. Chao Y.-S. Hernandez M. Lam M.-H. Montenegro J. Wright S.D. Detmers P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1747-1757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but not rat liver microsomes (25.Billheimer J.T. Gillies P.J. Esfahani M. Swaney J.B. Advances in Cholesterol Research. The Telford Press, Caldwell, NJ1990: 7-45Google Scholar). Furthermore, NBD-chol is esterified in hamster intestine and cultured Caco-2 intestinal cells (24.Sparrow C.P. Patel S. Baffic J. Chao Y.-S. Hernandez M. Lam M.-H. Montenegro J. Wright S.D. Detmers P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1747-1757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Based on the above findings, the fluorescence properties of DHE and NBD-chol as well as cultured L-cell fibroblasts, a cell line that grows in serum-free medium (26.Schroeder F. Perlmutter J.F. Glaser M. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6739-6746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were used to (i) compare the uptake and esterification of these sterols in the same cell type, (ii) determine if uptake of either fluorescent sterol was characteristic of HDL receptor mediated uptake, (iii) resolve the specificity of intracellular targeting of fluorescent sterol, and (iv) begin to determine the molecular basis for trafficking of cholesterol to lipid droplets.DISCUSSIONAlthough LDL receptor-mediated lipid metabolism has been characterized in depth over the past two decades, much less is known regarding the role of HDL in unesterified cholesterol dynamics, especially in living cells (for review, see Refs. 5.Stangl H.

Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston1998: 273-288Crossref Google Scholar). In contrast to LDL receptor-mediated lipid uptake, this “alternate” pathway utilizes a completely different receptor (SRB1 receptor instead of LDL receptor), has a different apoprotein specificity (binds HDL as well as LDL and VLDL), is mediated through a different plasma membrane microdomain (caveolae instead of clathrin-coated pits), does not internalize (endocytose) whole lipoprotein particles, and takes up lipids in the order: cholesterol esters ≫ phosphatidylserine > phosphatidylcholine = phosphatidylinositol > sphingomyelin (53.Rodrigueza W.V.

Although HDL mediates cholesterol ester uptake in nonplacental steroidogenic tissues as well as cultured cells (for review, see Refs. 4.Smart E.J. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Chang T.Y. Freeman D.A. Intracellular Cholesterol Trafficking. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston1998: 253-272Crossref Google Scholar and 54.Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar) only recently was this visualized with fluorescent sterol ester (55.Reaven E. Tsai L. Azhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16208-16217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In contrast, while it is generally accepted that HDL mediates rapid efflux of cellular unesterified cholesterol, a process termed “reverse cholesterol transport,” very little is actually known of HDLs role in uptake and intracellular targeting of unesterified cholesterol, especially in living cells (for review, see Refs. 5.Stangl H. Cao G. Wyne K.L. Hobbs H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31002-31008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar and 54.Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar). The results of the present investigation provided several new insights on HDL-mediated uptake on unesterified sterol uptake.First, comparison of the extent as well as t 12 of uptake for the fluorescent sterols, DHE and NBD-chol, to that of [3H]cholesterol suggested that the two fluorescent sterols may selectively probe different uptake pathways. Although the uptake and half-time for maximal uptake of the fluorescent DHE resembled that of [3H]cholesterol, NBD-chol uptake was >100-fold more rapid, but >100-fold less efficient. Recent data showed that NBD-chol uptake and flux through hamster intestine as well as NBD-chol uptake in Caco-2 cells is also markedly faster than that of radiolabeled cholesterol (24.Sparrow C.P. Patel S. Baffic J. Chao Y.-S. Hernandez M. Lam M.-H. Montenegro J. Wright S.D. Detmers P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1747-1757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although it was suggested that these differences are due to lower affinity of NBD-chol for a cholesterol transporter or decreased solubility of NBD-chol, the present data suggested otherwise. NBD-chol has very high affinity (nm) for lipid-binding proteins such as ADRP (present data) and sterol carrier protein-2 (16.Schroeder F. Frolov A. Schoer J. Gallegos A. Atshaves B.P. Stolowich N.J.

Scott A.I. Billheimer J.T. Schroeder F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35425-35433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Likewise, the critical micellar concentration of NBD-chol differs only 2-fold from that of DHE and cholesterol (27.Fischer R.T. Cowlen M.S. Dempsey M.E. Schroeder F. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3322-3331Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 57.Avdulov N.A. Chochina S.V. Igbavboa U. Warden C.H. Schroeder F. Wood W.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1437: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The two major receptor-mediated sterol transport pathways differ markedly in speed: slow (15–45 min) LDL receptor-mediated (endocytic) uptake (for review, see Ref. 52.Fielding C.J. Bist A. Fielding P.E. Chang T.Y. Freeman D.A. Intracellular Cholesterol Trafficking. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston1998: 273-288Crossref Google Scholar); fast (1 min) HDL receptor-mediated efflux of cholesterol (for review, see Ref. 4.Smart E.J. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Chang T.Y. Freeman D.A. Intracellular Cholesterol Trafficking. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston1998: 253-272Crossref Google Scholar). These data, taken together with the lipoprotein (HDLversus LDL and VLDL) specificity of NBD-chol uptake shown herein and earlier for esterified cholesterol (for review, see Refs. 5.Stangl H. Cao G.

Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as the effects of filipin on NBD-chol uptake shown herein and on cholesterol ester uptake elsewhere (for review, see Refs. 47.Schnitzer J.E. Allard J. Oh P. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H48-H55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48.Schnitzer J.E. Liu J. Oh P. J. Biol.

At equimolar concentrations these sterols differed less than <2-fold in esterification. L-cell esterification of DHE confirms an earlier study (2.Schroeder F. Frolov A.A. Murphy E.J. Atshaves B.P. Jefferson J.R. Pu L. Wood W.G. Foxworth W.B. Kier A.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1996; 213: 150-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) while that of NBD-chol clarifies a controversy in the literature (see Introduction). NBD-chol is esterified in vivo by hamster intestine and Caco-2 cells, derived from intestine, as well as in vitro by intestinal microsomes (24.Sparrow C.P. Patel S. Baffic J. Chao Y.-S. Hernandez M. Lam M.-H. Montenegro J. Wright S.D. Detmers P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1747-1757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, rat liver microsomes did not esterify NBD-chol (25.Billheimer J.T. Gillies P.J. Esfahani M. Swaney J.B. Advances in Cholesterol Research. The Telford Press, Caldwell, NJ1990: 7-45Google Scholar). The different observations may be due to differences in the substrate specificities of the two known acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferases (1 or 2). Acyl-CoA:cholesterolO-acyltransferase 1 is absent from intestinal cells while liver contains both acyl-CoA:cholesterol O-acyltransferase 1 and 2 (59.Yu C. Chen J. Lin S. Liu J. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36139-36145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Third, once internalized the fluorescent sterols rapidly target to lipid droplets. LSCM and MLSM imaging, colocalization with Nile Red, and FRET all indicated specific targeting of the HDL-mediated unesterified sterol uptake to lipid droplets. This process was specific for the HDL-mediated uptake of unesterified (shown herein) and esterified sterols, but not DiI (55.Reaven E. Tsai L. Azhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16208-16217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The speed (<30 s) of HDL-mediated NBD-chol targeting to lipid droplets was much faster than that of HDL-mediated uptake of BODIPY-cholesterol ester, 5 min (55.Reaven E. Tsai L. Azhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16208-16217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, this very rapid (<30 s) intracellular transfer of unesterified NBD-chol was similar to that of endogenously synthesized cholesterol from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface, 1 min (for review, see Ref. 4.Smart E.J. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Chang T.Y. Freeman D.A. Intracellular Cholesterol Trafficking. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston1998: 253-272Crossref Google Scholar), and implied a nonvesicular pathway(s). Several candidate intracellular cholesterol-binding proteins (sterol carrier protein-2, caveolin-1, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, etc.) for such a nonvesicular mechanism have been proposed (for review, see Refs. 4.Smart E.J. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Chang T.Y. Freeman D.A. Intracellular Cholesterol Trafficking. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston1998: 253-272Crossref Google Scholar and 16.Schroeder F. Frolov A. Schoer J. Gallegos A. Atshaves B.P. Stolowich N.J. Scott A.I. Kier A.B. Chang T.Y. Freeman D.A. Intracellular Cholesterol Trafficking. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston1998: 213-234Crossref Google Scholar).Fourth, the specific targeting of unesterified cholesterol to lipid droplets may be mediated, at least in part by ADRP, a lipid droplet specific protein (49.Jiang H.P. Serrero G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7856-7860Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). ADRP in L-cells was localized on the surface of lipid droplets as in other cell types (43.Brasaemle D.L. Barber T. Wolins N. Serrero G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2249-2263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More important, indirect immunofluorescence revealed that the ADRP was highly colocalized with NBD-chol in the lipid droplet. Finally, ADRP specifically bound NBD-chol with high affinity (K d = 2 nm), suggesting that this colocalization was due at least in part to direct binding of NBD-chol ADRP. This affinity was in the same range of that of other known sterol-binding proteins, e.g. sterol carrier protein-2 with K d = 6–11 nm(16.Schroeder F. Frolov A. Schoer J. Gallegos A. Atshaves B.P.

Chochina S.V. Igbavboa U. Warden C.H. Schroeder F. Wood W.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1437: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Since ADRP has been shown to also bind fatty acid (50.Gao J. Serrero G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16825-16830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar),2 this would indicate that ADRP can bind several types of lipid substrates, similar to sterol carrier protein-2 (30.Schroeder F.

Furthermore, both DHE and NBD-chol demonstrated specific targeting of unesterified sterol to lipid droplets, a process that was very rapid and potentially mediated by ADRP, a lipid-binding protein specific to droplets. Thus, these data provided basic new observations contributing to our understanding of HDL receptor-mediated uptake of unesterified cholesterol, its intracellular dynamics, and its targeting to lipid droplets, an organelle about which very little is known (43.Brasaemle D.L.

Because of cholesterol's dual role in both normal cell function and the pathobiology of atherosclerosis, it is essential to resolve the mechanisms whereby exogenous cholesterol is taken up and distributed within the cell (reviewed in Refs. 1.Schroeder F. Woodford J.K. Kavecansky J. Wood W.G. Joiner C. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1995; 12: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 2.Schroeder F. Frolov A.A. Murphy E.J. Atshaves B.P. Jefferson J.R.

Res. 1997; 38: 1503-1521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unesterified cholesterol uptake shares some, but not all, aspects of cholesterol ester uptake. Unesterified cholesterol enters the cell either by the slower LDL1 receptor mediated pathway wherein it leaves the LDL endocytosed within clathrin-coated vesicles prior to vesicle fusion at the lysosome (for review, see Ref.3.Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid. Res. 1997; 38: 1503-1521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by the rapid “alternate” HDL receptor pathway (3.Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid. Res. 1997; 38: 1503-1521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Stangl H. Cao G. Wyne K.L. Hobbs H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31002-31008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, most attention has focused on the HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux from rather than uptake of cholesterol into the cell (for review, see Ref. 4.Smart E.J. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Chang T.Y. Freeman D.A. Intracellular Cholesterol Trafficking. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston1998: 253-272Crossref Google Scholar). Almost nothing is known regarding the uptake and intracellular targeting of unesterified cholesterol via the HDL receptor pathway nor has the process been directly visualized. Fluorescent cholesterol analogs represent an opportunity for real-time monitoring of the rapid, HDL-mediated uptake of unesterified sterol uptake and movement in living cells. The main requirement for choice of an appropriate fluorescent cholesterol analogue is that it should mimic the behavior of cholesterol. Unfortunately, the functional properties of many fluorescent sterol analogues do not closely resemble those of cholesterol (for review, see Refs. 6.Schroeder F. Prog. Lipid Res. 1984; 23: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 7.Schroeder F. Roodyn D.B. Subcellular Biochemistry. Plenum Press, New York1985: 51-101Google Scholar, 8.Schroeder F. Nemecz G.

In exploring the molecular mechanism involved in HNF-1-dependent gene activation in the in vivo chromatin context, we found that HNF-1 can physically interact with the histone acetyltransferases (HATs) CREB-binding protein (CBP), p300/CBP-associated factor (P/CAF), Src-1, and RAC3. The transcriptional activation potential of HNF-1 on a genome integrated promoter was strictly dependent on the synergistic action of CBP and P/CAF, which can independently interact with the N-terminal and C-terminal domain of HNF-1, respectively. Moreover, the HAT activity of both coactivators was important, as opposed to the selective requirement for the HAT activity of P/CAF in activation from a transiently transfected reporter. Interaction of CBP with the N-terminal domain of HNF-1 greatly increased the binding affinity for P/CAF with the C-terminal activation domain, which may represent the molecular basis for the observed functional synergism. The results support a model that involves the combined action of multiple coactivators recruited by HNF-1, which activate transcription by coupling nucleosome modification and recruitment of the general transcription machinery.

Interaction of CBP with the N-terminal domain of HNF-1 greatly increased the binding affinity for P/CAF with the C-terminal activation domain, which may represent the molecular basis for the observed functional synergism. The results support a model that involves the combined action of multiple coactivators recruited by HNF-1, which activate transcription by coupling nucleosome modification and recruitment of the general transcription machinery. hepatocyte nuclear factor CREB-binding protein histone acetyltransferase p300/CBP-associated factor receptor associated coactivator 3 steroid receptor coactivator-1 amino acid(s) nucleotide(s) glutathioneS-transferase C-terminal activation domain trichostatin A Tissue-specific expression of hepatic genes is accomplished by the concerted action of a small number of liver-enriched regulatory proteins, including the HNF-11 (1.Bach I.

In functional assays, these coactivators increase HNF-1-dependent transcription in a synergistic manner. Substantial differences in coactivator usage or requirements for their HAT functions were observed between transiently transfected and chromosomally integrated reporters. We present evidence for a potential mechanism involved in CBP and P/CAF-mediated synergistic coactivation of HNF-1, which provides new insights into the mode of HNF-1-dependent target gene activation in the context of chromatin. To generate pCMV-myc-HNF-1, the coding region of human HNF-1 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers containing EcoRI and XbaI sites and inserted into the same sites of the pCDNA-myc vector (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid was sequenced and used for all subsequent clonings. The pGex-HNF-1 (1–295 aa, 91–295 aa, 283–493 aa, and 493–628 aa) plasmids were obtained by subcloning theNcoI/SmaI (nt 1–881), theBsu36I/SmaI (nt 279–881), theNcoI/NcoI (nt 843–1475), and theNcoI/XbaI (nt 843–1893) fragments into theSmaI site of the pGex 4T1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), respectively. pCDNA-CBP (31.Martinez-Balbas M.A. Bannister A.J.

NIH3T3 cell lines containing integrated copies of the 3xAlbPE-CAT reporter were generated by cotransfection of linearized 3xAlbPE-AdML-CAT and pCB6 (36.Ktistaki E. Ktistakis N.T. Papadogeorgaki E.

After selection with 0.6 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.), individual colonies were expanded and analyzed. Nuclear extracts from transfected Cos-1 cells were prepared as described (35.Reid J.L.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4469-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and the lysates were adjusted to 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 150 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmNaF, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml approtinin. After a preclearing step with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), the extracts were incubated with 4 μg/ml rabbit polyclonal CBP (Santa-Cruz Biotechnology) or mouse monoclonal FLAG antibody (Sigma) at 4 °C, followed by adsorption to protein A-Sepharose. After extensive washing with the above buffer, the complexes were resuspended in SDS sample buffer, separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunostained with goat polyclonal HNF-1 antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). 35S-Labeled, recombinant proteins were synthesized in vitro using the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. 2 μg of GST fusion proteins coupled to glutathione Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were incubated with thein vitro translated proteins in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml approtinin, at 4 °C with constant agitation. After excessive washing with the same buffer lacking bovine serum albumin, the beads were resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and the proteins were separated by electrophoresis in 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. In vivo protein-protein interactions between HNF-1 and the coactivator proteins, CBP, P/CAF, Src-1, and RAC3, were investigated by co-immunoprecipitation assays. Cos-1 cells were cotransfected with HNF-1 and CBP or FLAG epitope-tagged P/CAF, Src-1 and RAC3 expression vectors. Lysates from the transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with either αCBP or αFLAG antibodies, and the presence of HNF-1 in the precipitates was detected in Western blots using αHNF-1 antibody. As shown in Fig.1, substantial amounts of HNF-1 were coprecipitated with either the αCBP or αFLAG antibody from the different extracts, indicating that HNF-1 can interact with CBP, P/CAF, Src-1, or RAC3 in vivo To determine whether these interactions are direct and to map the relevant domains of HNF-1 involved in HNF-1-coactivator interactions, we performed in vitro GST pull-down assays. As shown in Fig.2 A, CBP specifically interacts with the N-terminal region of HNF-1. The minimal region required for this interaction was mapped between amino acids 95–295, which includes the POU-homeo-related DNA-binding domain of HNF-1 (Fig. 2 B). On the other hand, P/CAF, Src-1, and RAC3 interacted with the C-terminal activation domain (ADI), situated between amino acids 493 and 628. The reverse experiment using GST-CBP and GST-P/CAF fusion proteins and 35S-HNF-1 revealed that HNF-1 can interact with two distinct domains of CBP: the N-terminal aa 1–706 region and the aa 1620–1877 region (Fig. 2 C), both overlapping with the previously characterized CBP domains interacting with P/CAF (Fig.2 D). The minimal region of P/CAF required for interaction with HNF-1 was found to overlap with the RAC3 interaction domain (653–736 aa) but to be distinct from the CBP and Src-1-binding region (Fig. 2, C and D). To assess the functional significance of these interactions, we coexpressed HNF-1 together with CBP, P/CAF, Src-1 or RAC3 in NIH3T3 cells, and their effects on a synthetic HNF-1-dependent reporter (3xAlbPE-CAT) were measured. NIH3T3 cells were chosen for these assays because they lack endogenous HNF-1 and contain the lowest levels of endogenous CBP and P/CAF compared with other commonly used nonhepatic cell lines (data not shown). Under conditions where HNF-1 activated transcription 5-fold above basal levels, cotransfection of CBP, PCAF, Src-1, and RAC3 expression vectors resulted in 20-fold, 44-fold, 26-fold, and 19-fold further activation of HNF-1-dependent transcription, respectively (Fig.3 A). Coexpression of CBP with P/CAF, Src-1, and RAC3 resulted in 135-fold, 121-fold, and 89-fold induction, respectively, of the activity obtained with HNF-1 alone (Fig. 3 B). Similarly, coexpression of P/CAF with Src-1 or RAC3 increased the HNF-1 induced activity 132-fold and 152-fold, respectively (Fig. 3 B). These values are at least 2-fold higher than the sums of the superactivations observed by either coactivator alone and thus can be considered as synergistic effects. This synergism can be explained by a mechanism that involves simultaneous interactions of two coactivators with HNF-1 directly or indirectly through interactions of coactivators with each other when one is bound to HNF-1. To investigate these possibilities we first tested two C-terminally truncated constructs containing the 1–280 and the 1–440 amino acid regions of HNF-1. Proteins expressed from these vectors have previously been shown to retain the ability to enter the nucleus and bind DNA (14.Ktistaki E. Talianidis I. Science. 1997; 277: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), whereas the data presented in Fig. 2 indicate that they can interact in vitro with CBP but not P/CAF, Src-1, or RAC3. Our analysis focused on the synergism between CBP and P/CAF. In transient transfection assays, as expected, both HNF-1 (1–280) and HNF-1 (1–440) were inactive and were not activated by P/CAF, because they lack the essential ADI region (Fig. 3 C). Although they do contain the CBP interacting region, neither of them was activated by CBP alone, pointing to the importance of the ADI domain. When CBP and P/CAF were coexpressed along with HNF-1, substantial transactivation was detected which corresponded to 16–18-fold activation above basal levels (Fig. 3 C). This activation, however, has in neither case exceeded more than 2-fold the induction observed with wild type HNF-1. These results suggest that although the CBP-mediated recruitment of P/CAF onto HNF-1 may take place independently of the ADI region, the presence of ADI is necessary for the high level of synergism observed in Fig. 3 B. The ability of HNF-1-bound CBP to recruit P/CAF has also been observed in vitro. GST-HNF-1 (1–295), containing the CBP interaction domain of HNF-1, retained some35S-PCAF only when excess baculovirus expressed CBP was included in the binding reaction (Fig.4 A, left panel). To test whether CBP bound to the N-terminal region of HNF-1 may increase the binding of P/CAF to the C-terminal activation domain of HNF-1, we performed pull-down experiments using GST-HNF-1 (1–628), which contains the full-length protein. P/CAF efficiently interacted with full-length HNF-1 both in the presence and absence of excess cold CBP. However, when the stringency of the washing conditions was increased, the HNF-1- P/CAF complex was detectable only in the presence of CBP (Fig. 4 B). This effect was observed only in the context of the full-length HNF-1 protein and not with the fusion protein HNF-1 (493–628) containing the isolated P/CAF interaction domain. In fact, in this latter case CBP slightly reduced the binding of P/CAF to the HNF-1 ADI domain, which may be due to competition between HNF-1 ADI and CBP for interaction with P/CAF (Fig. 4 A, right panel). The above data strongly suggest that binding of CBP to the N-terminal region of HNF-1 increases the affinity of P/CAF binding to the C-terminal ADI domain, and the increased stability of this trimeric complex may be responsible for the synergistic activation observed in the transfection assays. Next, we investigated whether synergism between CBP and P/CAF is important for HNF-1-dependent activation in hepatic cells. Overexpression of CBP or P/CAF in HepG2 cells resulted in a 2.1- and a 1.8-fold increase of HNF-1-mediated transactivation, respectively (Fig.5 A). Coexpression of both CBP and P/CAF induced HNF-1 activity about 9-fold (Fig. 5 A), suggesting that CBP and P/CAF may act synergistically with HNF-1 in hepatic cells. The above values of induction are at least 1 order of magnitude smaller compared with those obtained with NIH3T3 cells. The difference can be explained by the much higher endogenous levels of CBP and P/CAF in HepG2 cells. To prove unequivocally that both CBP and P/CAF are important for HNF-1-mediated transcription in hepatic cells, we performed squelching experiments with E1A and its mutant derivatives defective in either interaction with CBP (E1A CBPMut) or with P/CAF (E1A P/CAFMut) or both (E1A ΔN) (35.Reid J.L. Bannister A.J. Zegerman P. Martinez-Balbas M.A. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4469-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Overexpression of wild type E1A efficiently inhibited HNF-1-dependent activation (Fig.5 B). A similar degree of inhibition was observed with either E1A CBPMut or E1A P/CAFMut, but not with E1A ΔN (Fig. 5 B), suggesting that the simultaneous interaction of HNF-1 with both CBP and P/CAF is necessary for high level activation in hepatic cells. To investigate the contribution of the HAT activities of CBP and P/CAF on their coactivation function on HNF-1, we compared the activities of wild type coactivator constructs with the activities of their mutant forms, CBP(L1690K/C1691L) and P/CAF(Y616A/F617A), which lack HAT activity (38.Korzus E.

The HAT-deficient (HAT−) CBP mutant coactivated HNF-1-dependent transcription and synergized with P/CAF to a similar extent as its wild type counterpart (Fig.6, A and C). On the other hand, diminished coactivation and no synergism were observed with the HAT− P/CAF mutant (Fig. 6, B andC). Overexpression of E1A, which can both inhibit the HAT activity of CBP and P/CAF and sequester them from transcription factors (35.Reid J.L. Bannister A.J. Zegerman P.

Treatment of cells with TSA did not further induce coactivation by CBP, P/CAF, and the CBP HAT− mutant but substantially affected the diminished coactivation by P/CAF HAT− (Fig. 6, A and B). These results suggested that the HAT function of P/CAF but not that of CBP is required for maximal transcription. The importance of nucleosome modifying activities for HNF-1-dependent transcriptional activation prompted us to study the function of coactivators using a genome-integrated promoter, because the chromatin structure adopted by the transiently transfected template could differ from the typical chromatin organization of the eukaryotic genome (42.Archer T.K. Lefebvre P. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Science. 1992; 255: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). To this end, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with 3xAlbPE-CAT, and cell lines containing stably integrated copies of the transgene were obtained by G418 selection. Individual cell lines were analyzed for HNF-1- and coactivator-induced transactivation. Overexpression of CBP, P/CAF, Src-1, and RAC3 only marginally induced HNF-1-dependent transcription from the integrated template by factors of 2.5-, 3.0-, 1.5-, and 1.7- fold, respectively (Fig.7). Interestingly, the HAT deficient mutants of either CBP or P/CAF did not coactivate HNF-1 in this system. High level activation (23-fold above that of HNF-1 alone) was observed only by the simultaneous overexpression of wild type CBP and P/CAF. Although cotransfection of Src-1 or RAC3 together with either CBP or P/CAF resulted in increased activation, the values obtained (5.4-fold for Src-1/CBP, 5.1-fold for RAC3/CBP, 5.0-fold for Src-1/P/CAF, and 5.2-fold for RAC3/P/CAF) correspond to an additive rather than synergistic effect. Similar additive effects were observed when wild type CBP and the HAT− derivative of P/CAF, or wild type p/CAF and the HAT− mutant of CBP were coexpressed (Fig.7). These results suggest that in the integrated promoter context the HAT activity of both CBP and P/CAF are equally required. Moreover, the actual rate of HNF-1-dependent transactivation highly depends on the composition of the coactivator complex. In this reporter system, the combined action of CBP and P/CAF was necessary to achieve the highest transcription rates. Previous studies employing in vitro transcription and transfection assays identified a large number of liver-specific genes activated by HNF-1 (12.Tronche F. Yaniv M. BioEssays. 1992; 14: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). These studies provided important information with respect to the crucial roles of HNF-1 on specific promoters and its cooperation with other transcription factors but did not reveal how HNF-1 could be involved in the activation of these genes in thein vivo chromatin context. Addressing this question, two recent reports suggested that the mechanism of HNF-1-mediated target gene expression in vivo might involve HNF-1-dependent remodeling of chromatin. First, DNase I-hypersensitive site mapping of the phenylalanine hydroxylase promoter revealed significant differences between wild type and HNF-1−/− mice (21.Pontoglio M. Faust D.M. Doyen A. Yaniv M. Weiss M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4948-4956Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, studies on the α1-antitrypsin-CBG gene cluster have shown altered patterns of DNase I-hypersensitive sites in hepatoma variants depending on the expression of HNF-4 and HNF-1 (22.Rollini P. Fournier R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10308-10313Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In both cases, a positive correlation between chromatin structure and target gene expression was observed. The above observations raised the question of whether the changes in chromatin structure are an indirect consequence of HNF-1 expression, e.g. via the activation of other genes, or whether HNF-1 could be directly involved in chromatin remodeling. The results presented in this paper demonstrating physical interactions of HNF-1 with proteins possessing intrinsic nucleosome modifying activities could provide the molecular basis for the second scenario. We found that CBP, P/CAF, Src-1, and RAC3 can independently interact with distinct functional domains of HNF-1 and dramatically increase HNF-1-mediated transactivation in a synergistic manner. The molecular basis of this synergism could lie in the ability of the coactivators to interact with each other. The importance of such interactions for the recruitment of multiple coactivators by various transcription factors has been demonstrated before (38.Korzus E. Torchia J. Rose D.W. Xu L. Kurokawa R. McInerney E.M. Mullen T.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1998; 279: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 39.Kurokawa R. Kalafus D. Ogliastro M.H. Kioussi C. Xu L. Torchia J.

A. 1996; 93: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). For example, in the case of nuclear hormone receptors, P/CAF and Src-1 seem to provide a molecular platform for the recruitment of CBP and thus to create a highly active coactivator complex (38.Korzus E. Torchia J. Rose D.W. Xu L. Kurokawa R. McInerney E.M. Mullen T.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1998; 279: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 39.Kurokawa R. Kalafus D. Ogliastro M.H. Kioussi C. Xu L. Torchia J. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Science. 1998; 279: 700-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that, in the case of HNF-1, a novel type of mechanism may apply that involves the interaction of CBP with the N-terminal domain of HNF-1, leading to increased affinity of P/CAF for the C-terminal domain of HNF-1. This could be achieved either by a CBP-induced conformational change in HNF-1 enhancing the affinity of P/CAF for HNF-1 or by the additional protein-protein interaction interface provided by CBP to P/CAF independently recruited by HNF-1. These two possibilities are probably not mutually exclusive, and the trimeric complex formed via multiple interactions (HNF-1 (N terminus)-CBP; CBP-P/CAF and P/CAF-HNF-1 (C terminus)) should be highly stable and represent the most active configuration of the HNF-1-coactivator complex. Although we have focused our investigation on CBP- and P/CAF-mediated activation, we speculate that the synergism observed with CBP and Src-1 or RAC3 may involve a similar mechanism. It is more difficult to explain the synergism observed with P/CAF and Src-1 or RAC3, because they contact the same domain of HNF-1. Although it is not known whether these interactions are mutually exclusive, it is possible that the two ADI domains in an HNF-1 dimer could provide interfaces for simultaneous binding of two different coactivator molecules. Another possibility is that HNF-1-bound P/CAF may recruit Src-1 or RAC3 via direct interactions with them. The fact that HNF-1 is able to recruit four different HAT proteins indicates that histone acetylation may play a role in HNF-1-dependent gene activation. Indeed, the histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA (45.Yoshida M. Kijima M. Akita M. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17174-17179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) strongly potentiated HNF-1 transcriptional activity, although it did not further enhance CBP- or P/CAF-mediated superactivation in transient transfection experiments. This indicates that histone deacetylation, which is inhibited by TSA, confers a repressed state to the promoter, which can be overcome by HNF-1-mediated recruitment of endogenous or transfected CBP and P/CAF. TSA-induced activation, however, was always smaller than that observed by overexpression of CBP or P/CAF, suggesting that their “adaptor” or “bridging” activities between HNF-1 and the general transcription machinery are also important in coactivator function. In this way, the processes of histone acetylation and transcriptional activation are closely linked. Different classes of transcription factors may not only recruit complexes with different coactivator compositions but may also induce different configurations of the specific coactivator components leading to both differential requirements for or modulation of their HAT activities. For example, the HAT activity of P/CAF but not that of CBP appears to be important for nuclear hormone receptor, MyoD or NFκB-dependent activation (38.Korzus E. Torchia J. Rose D.W. Xu L. Kurokawa R.

Westin S. Thanos D. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Collins T. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2790-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 38.Korzus E. Torchia J. Rose D.W. Xu L. Kurokawa R. McInerney E.M. Mullen T.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1998; 279: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that the Src-1 homologue pCIP can regulate the function of CBP by either stimulating or inhibiting its HAT activity in a substrate-specific manner (48.Perissi V. Dasen J.S. Kurokawa R. Wang Z. Korzus E. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3652-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the case of HNF-1 we found that the HAT activity of both CBP and P/CAF were equally important for high levels of activation when examined on genome integrated promoter as opposed to selective requirement for the HAT activity of P/CAF in the transiently transfected reporter. Moreover, in the integrated promoter context, only the combined action of CBP and P/CAF on HNF-1 was sufficient to induce high level transcription, whereas either CBP or P/CAF alone produced only marginal activation. These observations indicate that in the context of genomic DNA, the promoter is organized into a chromatin structure that imposes a stronger barrier for transcription, compared with that imposed by the structure formed on transiently transfected plasmid DNA, which may not be arranged in a typical array of nucleosomes (42.Archer T.K. Lefebvre P. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Science. 1992; 255: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The simultaneous requirement for multiple HAT activities with different substrate specificities (CBP and P/CAF) (26.Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar, 29.Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar, 32.Ogryzko V.V.

In this work we used a synthetic HNF-1-dependent promoter construct to avoid complications arising from the action of other DNA-binding proteins. This has allowed us to identify and analyze the functions of multiple coactivator proteins, which may provide a mechanistic ground to decipher the complex mechanism involved in HNF-1-dependent chromatin remodeling and gene activationin vivo. In the context of natural regulatory regions, however, the HNF-1-coactivator complex-mediated disruption of neighboring nucleosomes may also increase the access of other transcription factors, which may in turn alter the composition and configuration of the coactivator complex in a promoter-specific manner. In addition, the relative expression levels of the different coactivators in a given cell type may also play a determinative role in the actual composition of the coactivator complex recruited by HNF-1. In accordance with the differential effects of different combinations of coactivators observed in this study, we propose that the actual composition of the coactivator complex formed on HNF-1 may have a direct consequence on promoter strength and the contribution of HNF-1 in the transcriptional activity of a given gene in a given cell type.

One of the fragments was found to have 90 and 86% homology with rat and human ATP citrate-lyase (ACL) cDNA, respectively. When Hep G2 cells are cultured under either sterol-loaded or -depleted conditions, expression of the gene is induced approximately 2–3-fold by sterol depletion. To investigate the direct effect of SREBP-1a on transcription, luciferase assays using the promoter of the human ACL gene were performed. These deletion studies indicated that a minimum 160-base pair segment contains the information required for the transcriptional regulation brought about by enforced expression of SREBP-1a. Luciferase assays using mutant reporter genes revealed that SREBP-dependent transcriptional regulation is mediated by two nearby motifs, the SREBP-binding site (a TCAGGCTAG sequence) and the NF-Y-binding site (a CCAAT box). It was confirmed by gel mobility shift assays that recombint SREBP-1a binds to the sequence. Data from studies with transgenic mice and reporter assays show that the ACL gene promoter is activated by SREBP-1a more strongly than SREBP-2 in contrast to the HMG CoA synthase and LDL receptor gene promoters, which exhibit the same preference for the two factors. Therefore, SREBPs transcriptionally regulates ACL enzyme activity, which generates the cytosolic acetyl CoA required for both cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis.

SREBPs are synthesized as 125-kDa membrane-bound precursors and are activated by releasing the transcriptionally active NH2-terminal portion in a two step proteolysis (2.Sato R. Yang J. Wang X.

Studies using transgenic mice overexpressing either a mature form of SREBP-1 or SREBP-2 have revealed that SREBP-1 mainly regulates lipogenic gene expression and that SREBP-2 regulates cholesterogenic gene expression (5.Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Shimano H. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2331-2339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Shimomura I. Shimano H. Korn B.S. Bashmakov Y. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35299-35306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). This characterization is further supported by our previous findings that SREBP-2 gene expression is controlled by the intracellular cholesterol level and that this transcription is directly regulated by SREBPs through the SREBP-binding site in the promoter region (7.Sato R. Inoue J. Kawabe Y. Kodama T. Takano T. Maeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26461-26464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Unlike SREBP-2, two isoforms of SREBP-1 (SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c) are produced by alternate promoters (8.Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A. Wu J. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). SREBP-1a has a longer and therefore more potent transactivation domain at the extreme NH2 terminus than SREBP-1c. RNA protection assays have revealed that the SREBP-1c is more abundant than SREBP-1a in most mouse and human tissues (9.Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). However, SREBP-1c has been reported to be weaker than SREBP-1a in stimulating the transcription of target genes in in vitro assays because of its shorter transactivation domain (10.Shimano H.

In the current study we have established a CHO cell line transiently expressing a more potent transcription factor, human SREBP-1a, to identify unknown target genes for SREBP-1. In these cells expression of exogenous SREBP-1a is repressed until an inducer, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), is added to the medium. When the cells are cultured with a medium containing sterols and IPTG, this system enables genes induced in response to transient expression of SREBP-1a to be picked up, independent of the effects of endogenous SREBPs inactivated by sterols in the medium. Using a subtraction PCR method, we have subsequently managed to obtain several gene fragments induced by SREBP-1a. We have characterized the 5′-flanking region of one of these genes, the human ACL gene, and defined the region responsible for SREBP-dependent regulation. Furthermore, we have examined with reporter assays and transgenic mice expressing either SREBP-1a or SREBP-2 which isoform, SREBP-1 or -2, is preponderantly involved in regulation. Hygromycin B, G418, and lipoprotein-deficient serum were purchased from Sigma. Restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs. To generate a construct of human SREBP-1a containing amino acids 1–487, designated pOPI3SREBP1, a 1.5-kilobase pair fragment was made by PCR including NotI restriction sites at both ends. TheNotI-NotI PCR-generated fragment was ligated into the pOPI3CAT vector (Stratagene). A lac repressor expression plasmid, p3′SS (Stratagene), was stably transfected into CHO cells. On day 0, 1.5 × 105 CHO cells were seeded into each 60-mm dish with medium A (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F12 medium, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) supplemented with 7% fetal calf serum. On day 1, each monolayer was transfected with 3 μg of the plasmid using a calcium phosphate precipitation method. On day 2, the cells were trypsinized and reseeded into three 100-mm dishes. On day 4, the cells were refed with medium A supplemented with 7% fetal calf serum and hygromycin (400 μg/ml). Visible clones were picked up, subcloned, and maintained in the same medium. One of the clones expressing the lac repressor was established and designated CHO-Lac. The CHO-Lac cells were further transfected with pOPI3SREBP1 and cultured with a medium containing hygromycin and G418 (500 μg/ml) to obtain the CHO-487 cell line as described above. On day 0, 7 × 105 cells (CHO-Lac or CHO-481) were seeded into 100-mm dishes with medium A supplemented with 7% fetal calf serum. On day 3, the cells were refed with the same medium containing 1 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol, 10 μg/ml cholesterol, and 1 mm IPTG. After 19 h of incubation, the cells were harvested and total RNA was prepared. Poly(A) RNA was purified with an oligo(dT) column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). According to the procedures described in a previous paper (12.Wang Z. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11505-11509Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), PCR fragments induced by SREBP-1a were subcloned into a Bluescript vector. To pick up real positive fragments, Northern blot analyses on CHO-487 were carried out using each PCR fragment as a probe, and nucleotide sequences for inducible fragments were determined. The luciferase reporter plasmids were constructed by cloning the BglII-HindIII PCR fragments coding the 5′-flanking region of human ACL gene (13.Park S. Moon Y. Kim K. Ahn Y. Kim Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1353: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) into the same restriction sites of a pGL3 basic vector (Promega). To generate ACL-300, ACL-251, ACL-174, ACL-151, ACL-131, ACL-94, ACL-60, and ACL-30, PCR primers were designed to hybridize at the corresponding position (Fig.1) and were coupled with the common downstream primer from nucleotide +29. To disrupt one of three putative SREBP-binding sites within ACL-131 (the sites, SREa, SREb, and SREc), the megaprimers were amplified with the upstream primer with four to six mutations (GCCCTG → GAATTC at the SREa, AGGCTA → GAATTC at the SREb, TCGCCG → GAATTC at the SREc) and the common downstream primer, and further extended in the 2nd PCR as described previously (14.Inoue J. Sato R. Maeda M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 1191-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The expression plasmids, pSREBP1(1–487) and pSREBP2(1–481), and reporter plasmids, pHMG S containing a 0.5-kilobase human HMG CoA synthase promoter and pLDLR containing a 1.5-kilobase human LDL receptor promoter, have been described previously (15.Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar, 16.Sato R.

HEK 293 cells were cultured, and cell transfection, luciferase, and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (14.Inoue J. Sato R. Maeda M. J. Biochem.

Hep G2 cells were set up on day 0 (1.8 × 106 cells/100-mm dish) in medium B (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) supplemented with 7% fetal calf serum. On day 1, the medium was removed, and the cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and refed with medium B containing 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum supplemented either with 1 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol plus 10 μg/ml cholesterol or with a 50 μm concentration of a HMG CoA reductase inhibitor (pravastatin) plus 50 μmsodium mevalonate.

Riboprobes were prepared using CHO ACL cDNA, human S17 cDNA (from 1 to 370 bp) (17.Chen I.T. Dixit A. Rhoads D.D. Roufa D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Acta. 1992; 1132: 329-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with a digoxigenin RNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Hybridization signals were quantified with AttoPhos (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a FluorImager 595 (Molecular Dynamics). A double-stranded DNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides −118 to −102 of the ACL gene was 3′ end-labeled with a digoxigenin-11-ddUTP using a digoxigenin gel shift kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The digoxigenin-labeled probe was incubated with 50 μg of recombinant SREBP-1a in binding buffer. The reaction conditions have been described previously (15.Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). In competition assays, an excess amount of an unlabeled 17-bp fragment containing SREb in the human ACL promoter or the mutant SREb was added prior to addition of the labeled probe. Recombinant SREBP-1a (1–487) containing six consecutive histidines were expressed using a pET28 vector (Novagen) in Escherichia coli and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose affinity chromatography (Qiagen). Transgenic mice were as described previously (19.Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 20.Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Shimano H. J. Clin.

An equal aliquot of liver total RNA was pooled (15 μg) and subjected to Northern blot analysis using cDNA probes for mouse HMG CoA Synthase, LDL receptor and ACL (21.Shimano H. Yahagi N. Amemiya-Kudo M. Hasty A.H. Osuga J. Tamura Y. Shionoiri F. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Harada K. Gotoda T. Ishibashi S. Yamada N. J. Biol.

The resulting bands were quantified by exposure of the filters to BAS2000 with BAStation software (Fuji Photo Film, Co., Ltd, Japan), and the results were normalized to the signal generated from 36B4 mRNA. For the establishment of CHO-487, an expression plasmid containing human SREBP-1a (1–487) under the control of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter and lac operator was introduced into CHO cells constitutively expressing the Lac repressor (CHO-Lac). After 19 h of incubation of the cells with 1 mm IPTG, we examined the SREBP-1a inducibility by RNase protection assays. In CHO-487 cells SREBP-1a mRNA was slightly detectable even in the absence of IPTG but was increased approximately 10-fold by IPTG (data not shown). To carry out the subtraction PCR, we prepared total RNA from CHO-487 and CHO-Lac cells cultured with sterols plus 1 mm IPTG. It should be noted that sterols decrease the amount of the endogenous nuclear form of SREBPs in both cell lines and that IPTG increases exogenous SREBP-1a (1–487) in CHO-487 cells. We obtained several PCR fragments induced by SREBP-1a including fatty acid synthase, HMG CoA synthase, and stearoyl CoA desaturase-2 cDNA. One of these fragments was found to have 90 and 86% homology with rat and human ACL cDNA, respectively (data not shown), suggesting that this fragment encodes CHO ACL. Fig. 2 shows that expression of the mRNA for HMG CoA synthase was completely down-regulated in CHO-Lac cells and was induced in CHO-487 cells only by exogenous SREBP-1a. Expression of ACL mRNA was approximately 7-fold higher in CHO-487 cells. Unlike HMG CoA synthase, expression of ACL mRNA was not completely suppressed even in the presence of the high concentration of sterols. To determine whether expression of ACL mRNA is regulated by the intracellular cholesterol level, human hepatoma cells,i.e. Hep G2 cells, were cultured under either sterol-depleted or -loaded conditions, and Northern blot analysis was performed. Under the sterol-depleted conditions, expression of ACL mRNA was up-regulated 2–3-fold (Fig.3), indicating that the induction is not restricted in CHO-487 cells. Taken together, it is likely that the expression of the ACL gene is controlled by the intracellular cholesterol level through the action of SREBPs. To determine whether SREBP-1a directly regulates the transcription of ACL gene, we carried out luciferase assays using reporter genes including various deletion versions of the human ACL 5′-flanking region. HEK 293 cells were cotransfected with one of the reporter genes and either an expression plasmid for human SREBP-1a (1–487), pSREBP1(1–487), or an empty expression vector. Because a previous report demonstrated that all the minimal response elements for the ACL gene expression are localized within the human ACL promoter −300-bp region (13.Park S. Moon Y. Kim K. Ahn Y. Kim Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1353: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), we focused on the promoter activity of the first 300 bp 5′ to the transcription start site. Fig.4 clearly shows that enforced expression of SREBP-1a enhances the luciferase activities from 5- to 15-fold as long as the reporter gene contained the segment from −131 to +29 bp (the transcription start site is position +1). We also obtained the same results when the cells were cultured under either sterol-depleted or -loaded conditions (data not shown). Although it was found that expression of ACL mRNA in transgenic mice overexpressing either SREBP-1 or SREBP-2 was accelerated, it has been remained unclear whether this elevation is a direct effect of SREBPs action. This is, therefore, the first evidence demonstrating that SREBP-1 directly regulates the transcription of the ACL gene. To identify the sequence motifs in the region (from −131 to +29 bp) responsible for the SREBP-mediated transcriptional regulation of the ACL gene, we further carried out luciferase assays using various mutant versions of reporter genes. We found three putative SREBP-binding sites in the region (SREa, SREb, and SREc in Fig. 1) and mutated each of them to generate mutant versions of reporter genes. Furthermore, we mutated a CCAAT sequence, which is recognized by a ubiquitous transcription factor, NF-Y, to determine whether NF-Y is involved in the transcriptional regulation of the human ACL gene as well as farnesyl diphosphate synthase, HMG CoA synthase, squalene synthase, and SREBP-2 genes (14.Inoue J. Sato R. Maeda M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 1191-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 15.Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar, 23.Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Lee B.C. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 945-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Mutation of either the SREb or the CCAAT sequence resulted in a significant suppression of the SREBP-dependent induction of luciferase activities, whereas a more than 10-fold induction of luciferase activity by SREBP-1a was still observed even after the mutation of either the SREa or the SREc segment (Fig. 5). These results demonstrate that both the SREb and CCAAT sequence are important for transcription regulation. To confirm that the SREb sequence is recognized by SREBP-1a, gel mobility shift assays were performed with recombinant SREBP-1(1–487). As shown in Fig.6, a single-shifted DNA-protein complex was observed in the presence of recombinant SREBP-1a (lane 2). The band almost completely disappeared in the presence of an excess amount of an unlabeled wild-type probe but not a mutant probe (lanes 3 and 4). These results clearly show that SREBP-1a is capable of binding the TCAGGCTAG sequence in the ACL promoter. To assess the induction of ACL gene expression by SREBP-2, the luciferase assays were performed using an expression plasmid, pSREBP2(1–481). Fig. 7 shows that SREBP-2 is capable of stimulating the luciferase activities in a dose-dependent manner but that its effect is much less potent than that of SREBP-1a. Because we could not rule out the possibility that the amounts of expressed SREBP-1a and -2 proteins are not equal in each dose of transfected DNA, the induction of luciferase activities driven by either the human HMG CoA synthase or the human LDL receptor gene promoter was also investigated. The induction of both HMG CoA synthase and LDL receptor gene expression by SREBP-1a is slightly higher but almost comparable with that by SREBP-2. These results indicate that SREBP-1a is a more potent activator of ACL gene expression. It has been reported that expression of ACL mRNA in the livers of SREBP-1a transgenic (TgBP-1a) and SREBP-2 transgenic (TgBP-2) mice is enhanced (6.Shimomura I. Shimano H. Korn B.S. Bashmakov Y. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35299-35306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In the current experiment, expression of mRNA for the ACL, HMG CoA synthase, and LDL receptor genes in the livers of wild-type and transgenic mice were carefully investigated after 2-week feedings of a high protein/low carbohydrate diet followed by overnight fasting to induce the transgene and to minimize the effects of endogenous SREBPs. The levels of mRNA for the HMG CoA synthase and LDL receptor gene were almost the same in the TgBP-1 and 2 mice, whereas ACL gene expression was tremendously stimulated only in the TgBP-1a mice (Fig. 8). These findings are entirely consistent with the results of reporter assays in Fig. 7. The current assay system using a cell line inducibly expressing nuclear SREBP-1a (CHO-487) enabled us to identify a new target gene for SREBP-1a, the ACL gene. The transient expression system driven by IPTG is critical for seeing the effects of transcription factors that are usually activated only in the short term. Western blot analyses reveal that the level of SREBP-1a protein induced by IPTG is within the physiological range in CHO-487 cells (data not shown). In addition, at least three known sterol-responsive genes were identified by the PCR subtraction method in these cells, suggesting that the system functions correctly and that ACL is also one of the physiological targets of SREBPs. Furthermore, the fact that ACL gene expression is also stimulated in Hep G2 cells when the cells are cultured under the sterol-depleted conditions (Fig. 3) supports this. When the 5′-flanking region of the rat ACL gene (24.Kim K. Park S. Moon Y. Kim Y. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 759-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) is compared with that of the human gene, both the SREb sequence and the CCAAT box with the 13-bp spacing are highly conserved. The current study shows that ACL gene expression is enhanced by SREBP-1 in CHO cells and the livers of transgenic mice as well as human Hep G2 cells. Taken together, it is likely that transcription of ACL gene is regulated by a combination of SREBPs and NF-Y across species. Several genes, including SREBP-2, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, squalene synthase, and HMG CoA synthase have been shown to be regulated by the same combination of transcription factors (14.Inoue J. Sato R. Maeda M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 1191-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 15.Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar, 23.Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Lee B.C. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 945-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The distances between the two binding sites for SREBP and NF-Y in the promoter of these genes are all in the 15–21-bp spacing range that has been shown to give the highest induction of transcription by SREBP-2 in in vitro reporter assays (14.Inoue J. Sato R. Maeda M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 1191-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It may be possible that SREBP-2 requires this 15–21-bp spacing for the regulation of these genes involved in cholesterol synthesis but that SREBP-1 has a shorter necessary or ideal spacing for the induction of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, including ACL and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase with their 13- and 9-bp spacing, respectively. Interestingly, the SREb sequence (TCAGGCTAG) in the human ACL gene resembles the SRE motif (TCAGCCTAG) observed in the mouse glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase gene most closely among known SRE sequences (25.Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7298-7305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). ACL as well as acetyl CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase has been demonstrated to be induced during lipogenesis in the liver and belongs to a class of lipogenic enzymes. Recent studies with SREBP-1 knockout mice demonstrated that SREBP-1 plays a crucial role in nutritional induction of lipogenic enzymes including ACL (21.Shimano H. Yahagi N. Amemiya-Kudo M. Hasty A.H. Osuga J. Tamura Y. Shionoiri F. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Harada K. Gotoda T. Ishibashi S. Yamada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35832-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 22.Yahagi N. Shimano H. Hasty A.H. Amemiya-Kudo M. Okazaki H. Tamura Y. Iizuka Y. Shionoiri F.

In the absence of SREBP-1, the ACL mRNA level was profoundly suppressed despite concomitant activation of SREBP-2. This suggests that SREBP-1 is a major physiological regulator for ACL in the liver. It is consistent with our obtained result that SREBP-1 rather than SREBP-2 predominantly stimulates ACL gene expression in the transfection studies. However, residual ACL mRNA level was still found in the livers of SREBP-1 knockout mice that had been refed after fasting. In contrast, in a fasted state with both SREBP-1 and -2 suppressed, ACL mRNA was completely absent irrespective of the presence of SREBP-1, suggesting some significant contribution of SREBP-2 to ACL gene transcription in a nonfasted state. Because ACL is a cytosolic enzyme that generates and provides acetyl CoA for both cholesterol and fatty acid synthesisde novo, it might be reasonable that ACL gene transcription can be maintained in a sterol-regulatory fashion under the control of SREBP-2, even though the main regulation of ACL is mediated by SREBP-1 in a lipogenic regulatory manner. When CHO-Lac cells were cultured with sterols, there was a marked decline in HMG CoA synthase mRNA, but a much smaller decline in ACL mRNA (Fig. 2). This finding also support the concept that basal transcription of the ACL gene is driven primarily by factors other than SREBPs, whereas the HMG CoA synthase gene is more dependent on SREBPs, presumably on SREBP-2 in particular. It has been reported that insulin activates expression of mRNA for ACL as well as other lipogenic enzymes. Recently, several investigations have demonstrated that SREBP-1c expression is transcriptionally stimulated by insulin (26.Foretz M. Guichard C. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12737-12742Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 27.Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Ikemoto S. Horton J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13656-13661Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) and that the insulin-dependent hepatic expression of lipogenesis-related genes including fatty acid synthase, acetyl CoA carboxylase, S14, andl-pyruvate kinase is mediated by SREBP-1c (28.Foretz M. Pacot C. Dugail I. Lemarchand P. Guichard C. Liepvre X.L. Berthelier-Lubrano C. Spiegelman B. Kim J.B. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3760-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). It is therefore probable that hepatic ACL gene expression is under the control of SREBP-1c, a predominant form in the liver and mediator of insulin action. Intensive analyses of the rat ACL promoter sequence revealed that the region from −104 to −20 of the gene is responsible for regulation because of insulin (29.Fukuda H. Iritani N. Katsurade A. Noguchi T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 204-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 30.Fukuda H. Iritani N. Noguchi T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, this region does not contain the corresponding SREb site required for sterol-mediated regulation. It therefore remains unclear whether the SREBP action through the SREb motif might be involved in the insulin-dependent stimulation of transcription. In our recent study we found that a putative insulin response element in the human microsomal triglyceride transfer protein gene promoter contains a functional SRE sequence (16.Sato R. Miyamoto W. Inoue J. Terada T. Imanaka T. Maeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24714-24720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Because both insulin and SREBPs negatively regulate microsomal triglyceride transfer protein gene expression, SREBP-1c, which is believed to respond to insulin, might partly mediate insulin action under physiological conditions. Further work is required to elucidate the mechanism by which ACL gene expression is regulated by the insulin cascade and the SREBPs. In this study we have demonstrated that ACL is a new target gene for SREBP-1 using CHO-487 cells transiently expressing an active form of SREBP-1a. It has been reported that SREBPs activate the transcription of a number of genes encoding enzymes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis. It is noteworthy that the SREBPs, especially SREBP-1, can further regulate these two pathways by governing the synthesis of an initial common substrate, acetyl CoA, by a regulation of ACL gene expression.

The intracellular targets of these signals are well known and include genes encoding cytosolic effectors and specific inhibitors of the terminal apoptotic cascade (1.Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar, 2.Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). Much less is known about the transcriptional regulators responsible for the appropriate expression of these apoptosis-related genes, although it is probable that these genetic mechanisms are critical to the modulation of apoptosis in normal development, differentiation, and tissue modeling. The importance of this level of regulation is highlighted by the range of clinical abnormalities resulting from disregulated apoptosis, including cancer, autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorders, myocardial infarction, stroke, and liver disease (3.Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6205) Google Scholar). Unraveling the genetic mechanisms responsible for controlling susceptibility to apoptosis is essential for understanding both these abnormal states and many aspects of normal development. The transcription factor NF-κB1 is one of a growing list of transcriptional regulators known to directly affect apoptosis in a tissue specific manner (4.Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev.

Thus, NF-κB has been shown to affect apoptosis in liver, embryonic fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and neurones (6.Tong L.Q. Toliver Kinsky T. Taglialatela G. Werrbach Perez K. Wood T.

Clearly, a role for NF-κB in epithelial apoptosis could have significant implications for understanding the pathogenesis of a number of diseases. In an attempt to identify whether NF-κB directly regulates apoptosis in epithelium, we have studied the activity of this transcription factor during post-lactational involution, one of the most dramatic examples of a developmentally regulated epithelial apoptosis in mammals. Involution is characterized by an increase in the number of apoptotic events in the luminal epithelial layer of the lobulo-alveolar compartment soon after weaning (15.Strange R. Li F. Saurer S.

Development. 1996; 122: 181-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is followed by proteolytic degradation of supporting basement membrane and major remodeling of the gland to a near pre-pregnant morphology (15.Strange R. Li F. Saurer S. Burkhardt A. Friis R.R.

Maintenance of the differentiated structure of the gland and survival of the secretory epithelium during lactation depends upon a combination of extracellular survival signals originating from neighboring basement membrane, cell adhesion molecules, lactogenic hormones, and as yet undefined local factors (16.Lund L.R.

Disruption of these signals is known to potentiate apoptosis of mammary epithelial cells, but the downstream effectors of these pro-apoptotic signals remain elusive.

Few of these have yet to be shown to directly influence apoptosis in the mammary gland, although we have recently demonstrated delayed involution in conditional Stat3 null mice (23.Chapman R.S.

Neoplasia. 1999; 4: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, three studies have demonstrated that specific NF-κB subunits are elevated in breast tumors and transformed mammary epithelial cell lines (26.Dejardin E. Bonizzi G. Bellahcene A. Castronovo V. Merville M.P. Bours V. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1835-1841PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Nakshatri H. BhatNakshatri P. Martin D.A. Goulet R.J. Sledge G.W. Mol. Cell.

Thus, although no direct effect on apoptosis has been demonstrated to date, the implication of these observations is that inappropriate expression of NF-κB may contribute to mammary epithelial carcinogenesis through aberrant regulation of apoptosis in the developing or regressing mammary gland. In this study, we address the role of NF-κB activation on survival of normal mammary epithelial cells. First, we describe the activation and epithelial localization of NF-kB in mammary gland during involution. Then, by specifically altering NF-κB activity in a conditionally immortal cell line, KIM-2, we demonstrate that NF-κB suppresses physiological apoptosis in mammary epithelial cells. In the light of these observations, we suggest that NF-κB modulates survival of luminal epithelium, specifically during the process of involution; this is the first transcription factor shown to be a survival factor in mammary gland. This study also provides the first direct evidence that NF-κB negatively regulates apoptosis in epithelial cells. All cell culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Popo-1 and streptavidin-Texas Red conjugate were from Molecular Probes (Leiden, Netherlands). Fluorescein-conjugated and biotin-conjugated annexin V were from R & D Systems (Oxon, UK). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies to p65 (A) and p50 (C-19) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and monoclonal antibodies to p52 and IκBα (10B) were derived as described previously (29.Jaffray E. Wood K.M. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2166-2172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NF-κB promoter reporter vector, pEGFP-HIV-LTR, was constructed by inserting a 730-base pair BamHI/HindIII fragment from the vector pLTRXLUC (30.Schwartz O. Virelizier J.L. Montagnier L. Hazan U. Gene. 1990; 88: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) into the BamHI/HindIII sites of the enhanced GFP reporter vector pEGFP-1 (CLONTECH, Hampshire, UK). The adenoviral antisense vector adV-asIκB was constructed by insertion of the cDNA for IκBα into theEcoRV site of pAd.CMV-link (obtained from P. Moullier, Nantes, France) in the antisense orientation with respect to the cytomegalovirus promoter. Adenovirus type 5 cleaved withClaI was co-transfected into 293 cells with theNheI linearized plasmid containing the IκBα cDNA and recombinants isolated by 3 rounds of plaque purification. This virus and an adenovirus expressing β-galactosidase (adV-LacZ) were propagated in 293 cells. Virus was purified on CsCl gradients as described (31.Mautner V. Willcox H.N.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1974; 25: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), dialysed against culture medium, and stored at −70 °C. KIM-2 cells were maintained as described previously (32.Gordon, K. E., Binas, B., Chapman, R. S., Kurian, K. M., Clarkson, R. W. E., Clarke, A. J., Lane, E. B., and Watson, C. J. (2000) Breast Cancer Res., in pressGoogle Scholar). Cells were grown to confluence and transferred to differentiation medium (DM; Ham's F12/DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum, 1 μg/ml prolactin, 5 μg/ml insulin, 40 ng/ml dexamethasone, 5 μg/ml linoleic acid) for 12 days prior to incubation in apoptosis induction medium (AM; Ham's F12/DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum, 5 μg/ml linoleic acid). The NGR-KIM-2 clonal line was derived by calcium phosphate transfection using 24 μg of pEGFP-HIV-LTR and 1 μg of pcNeo on 75% confluent monolayers of KIM-2 cells. Following selection, colonies of 100–200 cells were picked and passaged at 50% density. Clones were tested for constitutive and LPS-inducible GFP expression by fluorescence microscopy. Adenoviral infection was performed on confluent monolayers of differentiated KIM-2 cells in 25-cm2 flasks. Purified virus was added to the cells in 500 μl of Ham's F12/DMEM, 3% fetal calf serum, 1 μg/ml prolactin, 5 μg/ml insulin, 40 ng/ml dexamethasone, and 5 μg/ml linoleic acid at a titer of 100 plaque-forming units/cell. After 1 h, 3 ml of DM was added, and cells were incubated for a further 4 h. At this time, DM or AM medium was applied, and cells were incubated for 17 h prior to harvesting. Immunohistochemistry for NF-κB p65 was carried out using a rabbit polyclonal antibody to p65 and the peroxide-based Envision system (Dako Ltd., Cambridge, UK) as described previously (23.Chapman R.S. Lourenco P.C. Tonner E. Flint D.J. Selbert S. Takeda K. Akira S. Clarke A.R. Watson C.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2604-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). For flow cytometry, KIM-2 cells were washed in PBS/1 mm EDTA, incubated for 10 min in PBS/0.25% trypsin/1 mm EGTA at 37 °C, and transferred to DMEM/10% fetal calf serum. Cell pellets were resuspended in PBS/1% serum and 1 × 105 cells were resuspended in 100 μl of annexin binding buffer (R & D Systems), 5 μg/ml propidium iodide, and 1 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-annexin V for 15 min in the dark prior to counting. For fluorescence microscopy, cells grown on Permanox slide flasks (Life Technologies) were washed in PBS and incubated in the dark for 15 min with 100 μl of annexin binding buffer, 2 μm popo-1, and either 1 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-annexin V or 0.5 μg/ml Biotin-annexin V. For Biotin-annexin V, slides were washed in 100 μl of annexin binding buffer and incubated in the dark with 1/2000 Texas Red-conjugated streptavidin. Nuclear extracts from tissue culture cells (33.Clarkson R.W.E. Chen C.M. Harrison S. Wells C. Muscat G.E.O. Waters M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 108-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and mammary gland tissue (34.Watson C.J. Gordon K.E. Robertson M. Clark A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6603-6610Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) were performed as described previously. 10 μg of nuclear protein was incubated for 1 h on ice with a 32P end-labeled oligonucleotide probe containing the NF-κB binding site motif from the HIV type 1 enhancer, electrophoresed on a 7% native polyacrylamide gel, dried, and autoradiographed. For supershift assays, 0.5 μg of antibody was co-incubated with binding reaction buffer for 2 h on ice. Cytoplasmic extracts (16 μg) were electrophoresed on a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted onto Hybond-C membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were blocked overnight in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% Marvel and incubated for 1 h with antibody. Following a further 1-h incubation with secondary antibody, bound antibody was detected by ECL reagent. Subsequently, membranes were stripped and incubated with polyclonal antibody p65(A) and detected as above. Endogenous NF-κB activity was identified by EMSA in murine mammary tissue during normal development. NF-κB exhibited stage specific changes in DNA binding activity throughout the developmental cycle (Fig.1 A). A high level of activity during gestation suggested a role for NF-κB early in adult mammary development. NF-κB activity then became undetectable during lactation but was evident 1 h after pup withdrawal and remained at low levels for the first 8 h before subsequently increasing to a maximum at 3 days of involution. This rise in NF·κB activity coincided with an increased number of apoptotic cells in the mammary gland and a concomitant decrease in the systemic levels of lactogenic hormones (15.Strange R. Li F. Saurer S. Burkhardt A. Friis R.R. Development. 1992; 115: 49-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Li M.L. Liu X.W. Robinson G. BarPeled U. Wagner K.U. Young W.S. Hennighausen L. Furth P.A. Proc.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1530-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Similarly, an increase in mobility of the DNA-protein complexes, first evident after 3 days of involution, correlated with an increase in metalloproteinase activity and the onset of major remodeling of the gland. Two predominant species were observed in gel shift assays, both exhibiting similar changes in intensity throughout the time course. The more slowly migrating species consisted almost exclusively of p65 and p50 subunits, whereas the faster migrating species consisted of p50 but little or no p65 (Fig.1 B). Additional isoforms other than p52 (Fig. 1 B) may be responsible for residual DNA binding activity in these complexes. Subunits p65 and p50 were also detected in the high mobility complex observed 4 days after weaning (Fig. 1 B). We suggest that this may contain proteolytically cleaved forms of NF-κB. To confirm the activation of NF-κB during involution, we performed immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded sections of mammary glands using an antibody to NF-κB p65. Weakly diffuse staining of epithelium and stromal tissue was observed in sections from day 10 lactating mice (Fig. 2 A). At 24 h of involution, strong nuclear staining was evident in approximately half of the luminal epithelial cells (Fig. 2, B andE). These positively stained cells exhibited a normal nuclear morphology and were distributed evenly along the intact epithelial lining of the lobulo-alveolar compartment (Fig. 2,B and E). Similar staining was observed in sections of mammary gland harvested at 72 h of involution. In addition to the reorganization of the lobulo-alveolar structure of the gland, there was an apparent increase in the proportion of positively stained nuclei in the surviving epithelial population (Fig. 2,C and f). These data demonstrate that activation of NF-κB occurs in nonapoptotic epithelial cells of the mammary gland during involution. DNA binding activity of NF-κB in KIM-2 mammary epithelial cells cultured in vitrowas concordant with the data observed during gestation, lactation, and involution of mammary glands in vivo (Fig.3 A). Proliferating, undifferentiated cells exhibited elevated levels of NF-κB activity, which reduced upon growth arrest and became undetectable following incubation for 6 days in DM, which contained the lactogenic hormones prolactin and dexamethasone. At this time, expression of whey acid protein, a late marker of differentiation, was induced (32.Gordon, K. E., Binas, B., Chapman, R. S., Kurian, K. M., Clarkson, R. W. E., Clarke, A. J., Lane, E. B., and Watson, C. J. (2000) Breast Cancer Res., in pressGoogle Scholar). We have previously shown that differentiated KIM-2 cells rapidly undergo apoptosis following removal of the lactogenic hormones from the culture medium (32.Gordon, K. E., Binas, B., Chapman, R. S., Kurian, K. M., Clarkson, R. W. E., Clarke, A. J., Lane, E. B., and Watson, C. J. (2000) Breast Cancer Res., in pressGoogle Scholar). Under these conditions (with AM), NF-κB activity became markedly elevated. Detailed inspection of the kinetics of this response revealed that DNA binding activity was highest after a 4-h incubation in AM and remained above unstimulated levels for up to 96 h (Fig.3 B). Maximal NF-κB activity preceded detectable annexin V staining in situ (data not shown). Two complexes were observed (Fig. 3 B, i and ii) and, in accordance with mammary gland extracts, these complexes were shown to consist predominantly of p65/p50 (more slowly migrating species) and p50 (faster migrating species) isoforms (Fig. 1 B). Both isoforms exhibited similar changes in DNA binding activity. This activity also coincided with a decrease in the cytoplasmic levels of IκBα protein indicative of IκBα degradation, whereas cytosolic p65 levels were comparatively stable (Fig. 4).Figure 4Expression of IκBα and p65 in KIM-2 cells following apoptotic stimulus. Cytoplasmic proteins, extracted at intervals (hours) following the addition of AM were used in Western blot analysis with antibodies to IκBα and p65. The membrane was stripped following detection with IκBα antibody and reprobed with antibody for p65.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether NF-κB influenced the apoptotic response induced by hormonal withdrawal, we stimulated NF-κB in KIM-2 cellsvia three distinct pathways with the soluble ligands LPS, IL-1α, and TNF-α. All three ligands stimulated a rapid and prolonged activation of NF-κB DNA binding (data not shown). To ascertain whether this increased DNA binding activity resulted in increased trans-activation of NF-κB responsive promoters, we treated NGR-KIM-2 clones, stably transfected with an NF-κB-responsive GFP reporter construct, with either TNF-α or AM. Both treatments resulted in an increase in the proportion of cells expressing detectable levels of GFP (Fig. 5 A). All three ligands also suppressed the extent of apoptosis normally observed in KIM-2 cells following hormone withdrawal (Fig. 5 B). Thus, all three ligands that induced NF-κB in KIM-2 cells partially compensated for the removal of survival factors from the medium. In KIM-2 cells induced to die by removal of lactogenic hormones, annexin V and GFP did not co-localize to the same cells (Fig.5 A). In an analysis of over 1000 annexin V-positive cellsin situ, we did not detect a single example of co-localized GFP and annexin V, suggesting that NF-κB was activated selectively in surviving cells. To circumvent the possibility of secondary effects of these ligands on the cell death pathways, we introduced an antisense adenoviral expression construct for IκBα, the endogenous repressor of NF-κB, into KIM-2 cells. Infection of confluent monolayers of differentiated KIM-2 cells by this method resulted in approximately 30% transduction efficiency as measured by β-galactosidase assay (data not shown) using an adenoviral LacZ expression construct (adV-LacZ), which was also used as a control vector for the adenoviral antisense IκB construct (Fig. 6, A andB). Expression of the antisense construct (adV-asIκB) potentiated both NF-κB DNA binding in KIM-2 cells as shown by EMSA (Fig. 6 A) and transcriptional activation of the NF-κB-responsive promoter in NGR-KIM-2 cells (Fig. 6 B). Indeed, induction of NF-κB by the antisense IκB construct exceeded the previously observed NF-κB response to the apoptotic stimulus (AM) alone (Fig. 6 A). Differentiated KIM-2 cells, transduced with adV-asIκB or adV-LacZ constructs, were tested for their response to the removal of lactogenic hormones (Fig. 6 C). Cells were subjected to AM for 17 h and then assessed for apoptosis by annexin V staining and flow cytometry. The enhanced activation of NF-κB with as IκB inhibited the induction of apoptosis following removal of lactogenic hormones (Fig. 6 B), confirming the results obtained with cytokine stimulation. The inhibitory effect was greater than that achieved by co-incubation with the ligands described above (Fig. 5 B), presumably because of the larger proportion of cells expressing high levels of active NF-κB. This finding confirms that activation of NF-κB alone promotes survival of these mammary epithelial cells, in the absence of hormonal survival signals. Modulation of apoptosis is now a well recognized function of NF-κB. In addition to many reports of its activation by cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic insults including DNA damage, cytokines, and hypoxia (4.Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar,5.Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), there is some evidence to suggest that this transcription factor also regulates apoptosis during fetal development (8.Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar, 37.Kanegae Y. Tavares A.T. Belmonte J.C.I. Verma I.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 611-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). However, our understanding of its precise role in developing tissues is rudimentary. In this study we have demonstrated a novel, stage-specific pattern of NF-κB activity during adult mammary gland development and have also shown a direct effect of this transcription factor on epithelial cell death. NF-κB was activated during involution and was restricted to mammary epithelia, suggesting that it may directly regulate luminal epithelial cell death as part of the normal developmental cycle. Activated NF-κB consisted predominantly of p65 and p50 subunits, which are the most commonly activated forms of NF-κB in other cell types (4.Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar, 5.Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). This is one of a growing number of transcriptional regulators known to be activated within the first 24 h of involution (15.Strange R. Li F. Saurer S. Burkhardt A. Friis R.R.

Physiol. 1998; 174: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), signifying a substantial reorganization of gene expression in the gland during the transition from lactation to involution. Activation of NF-κB is one of the most rapid transcription factor responses, with detectable DNA binding within 2 h following cessation of suckling and significantly greater activity observed after 24 h. Two events are known to occur sufficiently early during involution to potentially cause this activation. Milk stasis occurs in the gland as a result of the cessation of milk removal; this is thought to induce apoptosis, possibly through mechanical stretching of the secretory epithelium lining the alveoli of the gland (35.Quarrie L.H. Addey C.V.P. Wilde C.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). A similar mechanical stimulus activates NF-κB in vascular endothelial cells (38.Hishikawa K. Oemar B.S. Yang Z.H. Luscher T.F. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In addition to milk stasis, a decline in the levels of lactogenic hormones promotes the onset of involution (15.Strange R. Li F. Saurer S. Burkhardt A. Friis R.R. Development. 1992; 115: 49-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Li M.L. Liu X.W. Robinson G. BarPeled U. Wagner K.U. Young W.S. Hennighausen L. Furth P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Whether the removal of a hormonal stimulus could directly activate NF-κB activity remains speculative. However, this possibility is supported by our in vitro model of hormone-dependent survival of KIM-2 cells in which apoptosis and NF-κB are induced following removal of lactogenic hormones (Fig. 3 and Ref. 32.Gordon, K. E., Binas, B., Chapman, R. S., Kurian, K. M., Clarkson, R. W. E., Clarke, A. J., Lane, E. B., and Watson, C. J. (2000) Breast Cancer Res., in pressGoogle Scholar). In this in vitro model, approximately one-third of the cells become apoptotic after 17 h of hormone depletion. In contrast, just 3% of the epithelial population of the mammary gland appeared apoptotic after 24 h involution (23.Chapman R.S. Lourenco P.C. Tonner E. Flint D.J. Selbert S. Takeda K. Akira S. Clarke A.R. Watson C.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2604-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). A number of factors could explain this apparent disparity, such as a deficiency of stromal and extracellular matrix interactions in cell culture, the effect of sudden and complete removal of hormones from the medium in vitro, and the fact that apoptotic cells are rapidly cleared in vivo by phagocytosis. We have shown that IκBα levels decline as NF-κB activity increases in KIM-2 cells, suggesting that NF-κB is activated in mammary epithelium by targeted degradation of this repressor. The source of the stimulus remains elusive, but several signaling pathways that result in phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα have been described in mammary epithelial cells (25.Clarkson R.W.E. Watson C.J. J. Mamm. Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 1999; 4: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition to the mechanical stretch stimulus and peptide hormone signals described above, the ability of TNF-α and IL-1α to induce NF-κB in KIM-2 cells suggests that cytokines are able to activate NF-κB in epithelium in vivo as described for other cell types (9.Wang C.Y.

Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar). Cytokines are present in milk and are proposed to act in a paracrine/autocrine fashion to influence mammary function (39.Goldman A. Chheda S. Garofalo R. Schmalsteig F. J. Mamm. Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 1996; 1: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Potential sources of these cytokines include milk leukocytes (40.Skansen-Saphir U. Linfors A. Andersson U. Pedriatr. Res. 1993; 34: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), mammary epithelium (41.Hara T. Irie K. Saito S. Ichijo M. Yamada M. Yanai N. Miyazaki S. Pediatr. Res. 1995; 37: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and adipocytes of the stroma (42.Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6193) Google Scholar). Our data unequivocally show that NF-κB suppresses apoptosis in mammary epithelial cells and give the first example of a transcription factor mediating survival in mammary involution. Thus, activation of NF-κB with extracellular ligands (Fig. 5) or by specific inhibition of the endogenous repressor IκBα (Fig. 6) led to suppression of apoptosis in KIM-2 cells. In the latter case, almost all apoptosis was blocked, indicating that NF-κB can compensate for the loss of all three survival factors: insulin, prolactin, and dexamethasone. The absence of active NF-κB in apoptotic cells both in vivo(Fig. 2) and in vitro (Fig. 6 B) further supports our conclusion that NF-κB promotes survival during the involution process. Paradoxically, our results using two separate assays indicated that NF-κB activity was negligible during lactation when the frequency of apoptosis was low (Figs. 1 and 2). Similarly, NF-κB activity in differentiated KIM-2 cells was barely detectable (Fig. 3). We conclude that signaling molecules other than NF-κB mediate survival of differentiated epithelium during lactation and that NF-κB is induced, either directly or indirectly, by an apoptotic stimulus that is initiated immediately following pup withdrawal. This unexpected observation suggests that internal homeostatic signals exist within epithelium to modulate involution by selectively conserving certain cells in the population. This hypothesis is consistent with the paradigm of NF-κB-mediated suppression of TNF-α cytotoxicity in TNF-α-responsive cells (9.Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar, 10.Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar, 11.Liu X.W. Robinson G.W.

Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar). TNF-α stimulates NF-κB through targeted degradation of IκB. NF-κB then inhibits the death signal by trans-activating genes that promote resistance to apoptosis (9.Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar).The effect of this negative feedback mediated by NF-κB is the modulation of apoptosis in response to the TNF-α death signal. A modulatory function of NF-κB is also consistent with the current two-stage model of mammary gland involution (16.Lund L.R. Romer J. Thomasset N. Solberg H. Pyke C. Bissell M.J. Dano K. Werb Z.

The first stage of involution is initiated by unknown, locally derived stimuli and is accompanied by activation of Stat3 (11.Liu X.W. Robinson G.W. Hennighausen L. Mol.

A. 1997; 94: 3425-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). After approximately 48 h, the gland begins the second stage of involution, characterized by an increase in metalloproteinase gene expression, degradation of the supporting basement membrane, and subsequent remodeling of the gland (15.Strange R. Li F. Saurer S. Burkhardt A. Friis R.R. Development. 1992; 115: 49-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Lund L.R. Romer J. Thomasset N. Solberg H. Pyke C. Bissell M.J. Dano K. Werb Z. Development. 1996; 122: 181-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Initial activation of NF-κB during first stage involution could be a direct result of perturbation of cell contacts between apoptotic cells and their neighbors. Our cell model allows us to look at apoptotic responses in the context of cell adhesions and extracellular matrix interactions (32.Gordon, K. E., Binas, B., Chapman, R. S., Kurian, K. M., Clarkson, R. W. E., Clarke, A. J., Lane, E. B., and Watson, C. J. (2000) Breast Cancer Res., in pressGoogle Scholar). Preliminary data suggest that KIM-2 cells exhibit morphological and cell adhesion changes in response to apoptosis in adjacent cells . 2E. Kritikou, personal communication. A similar process has been demonstrated in kidney cortex epithelium, where cells rearrange and alter the distribution of cell adhesion molecules as a consequence of their contact with apoptotic neighbors (45.Soler A.P. Mullin J.M. Knudsen K.A. Marano C.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 39: F869-F879Google Scholar). NF-κB activity is maximally induced at the onset of second-phase involution, at a time when proteases disrupt cell-extracellular matrix interactions (16.Lund L.R. Romer J. Thomasset N. Solberg H. Pyke C. Bissell M.J. Dano K. Werb Z. Development. 1996; 122: 181-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the loss of extracellular matrix contacts in cultured pancreatic acinar cells leads to NF-κB activation and apoptosis (46.Gukoyskaya A.S. Gukovsky I.Y. Periskic S. Blinman T. Zaninovich V. Pandol S.J. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: A446Google Scholar). These findings raise the speculative but intriguing possibility that NF-κB is induced as a direct consequence of a reduction in adhesion-mediated cell survival and is consistent with our proposal that NF-κB performs a homeostatic function during involution. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that NF-κB regulates a number of integrins and cell adhesion molecules that are known to promote mammary epithelial cell survival (18.Streuli C.H. Gilmore A.P. J. Mamm. Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 1999; 4: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 25.Clarkson R.W.E. Watson C.J. J. Mamm. Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 1999; 4: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Given its apparent role in mammary gland, inappropriate NF-κB signaling may lead to the progressive accumulation of cells that would otherwise be destined to undergo apoptosis. Therefore, constitutive NF-κB activity could exacerbate mammary breast cancer. Indeed, previous studies have described elevated levels of NF-κB in mammary tumors (26.Dejardin E. Bonizzi G. Bellahcene A. Castronovo V. Merville M.P. Bours V. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1835-1841PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Nakshatri H. BhatNakshatri P. Martin D.A. Goulet R.J. Sledge G.W. Mol. Cell.

Invest. 1997; 100: 2952-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). However, the conclusions reached by these studies relating to the identity of the subunits activated and, consequently, the precise function of NF-κB, were inconsistent. In contrast, we show here an increase of NF-κB in normal tissue during adult mammary development, and we show that this correlates with trans-activation of an NF-κB responsive promoter and suppression of death. Our results, therefore, provide a mechanism by which high levels of NF-κB may contribute to tumor progression, pointing to NF-κB as a future target of therapeutics for breast cancer."

This adhesion step is followed by platelet activation that is accompanied by synthesis and release of pro-aggregatory molecules such as TXA21 and ADP, which amplify platelet responses to collagen and recruit additional platelets to the site of injury, respectively (1.Kroll M.H. Sullivan R. Localzo J. Schafer A.I. Thrombosis and Hemorrhage. 2nd Ed. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1998: 261-291Google Scholar). The concerted action of collagen, ADP, and TXA2 activates specific signaling pathways, generating a number of second messengers and leading to the functional expression of integrin αIIbβ3, the fibrinogen receptor on platelets (1.Kroll M.H. Sullivan R. Localzo J. Schafer A.I. Thrombosis and Hemorrhage. 2nd Ed. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1998: 261-291Google Scholar). Binding of fibrinogen to platelets mediates platelet aggregation, the final common response of activated platelets to most agonists. In addition to platelet aggregation, normal hemostasis involves activation of the blood coagulation cascade and vasoconstriction, making it a very redundant system (2.Hawiger J. Brass L.F. Salzman E. Colman R.W. Hirsh J. Marder V.J. Salzman E. Hemostasis and Thrombosis: Basic Principles and Clinical Practice. 3rd Ed. J. B. Lippincott, Philadelphia1994: 603-627Google Scholar). Redundancy is also observed in terms of the receptors involved in platelet responses for each specific agonist. It has now become clear that physiologic platelet agonists stimulate platelets by more than one receptor, and specific platelet responses involve distinct receptors. Accordingly, it has been shown that integrin α2β1 receptor mediates platelet adhesion to collagen, whereas GPVI induces most of the signal involved in platelet activation, including phospholipase Cγ2 activation by a tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway (3.Santoro S.A. Zutter M.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 4.Ichinohe T. Takayama H. Ezumi Y. Yanagi S. Yamamura H. Okuma M. J. Biol.

Invest. 1997; 100: 514-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). On the other hand, thrombin activation of PAR1, but not PAR4, is involved with the formation of the signaling pathway necessary for exposure of negatively charged molecules that increase platelet pro-coagulant activity (7.Kahn M.L.

Reeves P.S. DeGuzman F. Deshpande U. Misnistri-Madrid K. Dubridge R.B. Phillips D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13335-13341Google Scholar). In the case of ADP, platelets have three distinct receptors as follows: an ionotropic receptor (P2X1) involved with Ca2+influx; a P2Y1-Gq protein-coupled receptor that mediates platelet shape change and phospholipase C activation; and a P2YAC-Gi protein-coupled receptor related to inhibition of adenylate cyclase (10.Daniel J.L.

Activation of both P2Y1 and P2YAC receptors is necessary for full platelet activation by ADP (12.Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

One site binds TXA2 mimetics with high affinity and mediates shape change, calcium increase, and cortactin phosphorylation by a Gα12/13-coupled receptor. Another site, of lower affinity, mediates platelet secretion, PKC activation, and platelet aggregation via a Gq-coupled TP receptor (18.Offermans S. Toombs C.F. Hu Y.-H. Simon M.

Of interest, these pro-hemostatic mechanisms are counterbalanced and regulated by a number of physiologic anti-hemostatic molecules that work in a concerted and redundant manner, including the release of prostacyclin, nitric oxide (NO), and endothelium-dependent hyperpolarizing factor by the endothelium as well as ADP hydrolyzing activity of endothelial cell membrane apyrase (CD39) (24.Fisslthaler B.

In this context, the salivary glands of blood-sucking insects have evolutionarily developed a number of molecules able to counteract the physiologic pro-hemostatic mechanisms that are triggered to avoid blood loss (27.Ribeiro J.M. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1987; 32: 463-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). In most cases, more than one component with distinct anti-hemostatic function has been isolated from the same saliva of blood-sucking insects. In fact, in addition to inhibitors of blood coagulation (28.Zhang Y. Ribeiro J.M. Guimarães J.A. Walsh P.N.

In our previous work characterizing salivary antiplatelet activity fromRhodnius prolixus, we found, by preparative agarose gel electrophoresis, at least three activities inhibiting collagen-induced platelet aggregation.

Aliquots of the fractions (150 μl) were transferred to conical polypropylene tubes containing 10 μl of 1 mg/ml BSA (to prevent loss of the protein of interest by irreversible adsorption to the tubes) and dried using a SpeedVac centrifuge (Savant Instruments, Farmingdale, NY) attached to a model 1405 vacuum pump (Sargent-Welch, Skokie, IL). After the tubes were dry, 0.4 ml of water was added to each and the drying procedure repeated. Three such additions of water were needed to remove all the ammonium formate from the fractions. These dried fractions were reconstituted with 100 μl of 10 mm HEPES plus 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4, and assayed for their inhibition of platelet aggregation as described below. Active fractions were pooled and further submitted to reverse-phase chromatography using a 4.3 × 250 mm Macrosphere column (300 Å pore, octadecyl silica column) from Alltech (Deerfield, IL). A gradient from 10 to 60% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water at 0.5 ml/min with duration of 80 min was imposed after application of the sample. Eluates monitored at both 220 and 280 nm were collected at 1-min intervals. Aliquots of these fractions were transferred to conical 1.5-ml tubes containing 10 μl of 1 mg/ml BSA and dried once as described above. These were tested for platelet aggregation inhibitory activity after reconstitution in 100 μl of HS. Amino acid analysis, mass spectrometry, and amino-terminal sequencing of the purified proteins were performed by the Harvard microchemistry facility under the direction of Dr. William Lane. Laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry was performed with a Finnigan LaserMat (San José, CA). Amino-terminal sequencing of the salivary RPAI-1 used a G1000A protein sequencer (Hewlett-Packard, Rockville, MD) with on-line 1090 HPLC. A 100-μl aliquot of anR. prolixus salivary cDNA library constructed in λ-ZAP (54.Yin K. Halushka P.Y. Yan Y. Wong P.Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 270: 1192-1196PubMed Google Scholar) was extracted with phenol/chloroform (43.Champagne D.E. Nussenzveig R.H. Ribeiro J.M. J. Biol.

Nature. 1989; 342: 224-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) to obtain a template for polymerase chain reactions (PCRs). A partial clone of C31R64 was amplified by PCR using the forward primer CCTAGYGGITGYGCIGAYGTNCA (where Y = C, T, N = G, C, A, T, and I =inosine) and T7 as the reverse primer. PCR conditions were as follows: annealing at 42 °C for 1 min, extension at 72 °C for 2 min, and denaturing at 95 °C for 30 s, with 100 ng of template and 0.1 μg of each primer in a final volume of 100 μl, for a total of 30 cycles. The PCR buffer composition was 25 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 0.01% gelatin, 0.2 mm of each dNTP, and 1.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The PCR product was gel-purified (Sephaglas BandPrep kit; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and cloned into the pCR II vector (TA cloning kit; Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The identity of the PCR product was confirmed by sequencing (Molecular Genetics Instrumentation Facility, University of Georgia) using the SP6 primer. For library screening, the cloned PCR product was labeled with digoxigenin by a further round of PCR using the Genius labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A total of 20,000 cDNA recombinants were screened, with overnight hybridization at 65 °C followed by two room-temperature washes in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS and two washes at 65 °C in 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS. Positive clones were visualized using the nitro blue tetrazolium/X-phosphate color reaction protocol (Genius kit; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Ten positive clones were picked, extracted in SM buffer, and screened a second time with the same probe and protocol. Clones from the second round of screening were converted to Bluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) plasmids using the manufacturer's excision protocol in Escherichia coli XL1 blue mrf−cells. Four clones were sequenced in both directions at the Molecular Genetics Instrumentation Facility. Sequence comparisons, translations, and BLAST searches were performed using the GCG software package. Two variants of C31R64, differing in seven amino acids in the mature peptide region, were noted. The variants differed in the presence or absence of a NdeI restriction site. To determine the relative abundance of the two variants, the insert region of each of the 10 C31R64 clones was excised with EcoRI andXhoI (Life Technologies, Inc.), gel-purified (Sephaglas BandPrep kit; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and digested withNdeI. Restriction digest products were visualized on a 1% agarose gel. A partial PCR-generated clone of C36R66 was isolated as described above for C31R64, using the forward primer GCNACNACIATGCCIAARGARTG. This primer was designed for a different protein (not included in the present report), but cDNA of C36R666 was fortuitously also amplified, TA cloned, and sequenced. Subsequent procedures were as described above, with the exception that five λ-ZAP cDNA clones, all identical, were isolated and sequenced. The cDNA for C36R66 was prepared for expression in E. coli by inserting an NdeI restriction site at the 5′ end of the coding sequence. This was accomplished by PCR using the primer CTAGCTAGCATATGGAGGCATTCTGTGCTAACCCTCC along with a primer complementary to the T7 RNA polymerase recognition site. The reaction produced a single product of approximately 0.5 kilobase pairs. The product was purified in an agarose gel and cloned into the vector PCR2.1 (Invitrogen). After confirmation of the sequence of the insert, the modified cDNA was cut with NdeI, and XhoI was moved into the expression vector pET17B (Novagen, Madison, WI). Cultures of the resulting clone were grown in Luria broth (LB) medium at 37 °C in 2.0-liter Fernbach flasks to an optical density of 0.6–1.0, and expression of RP66 was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.6 mm. At the point of induction, the incubation temperature was reduced to 30 °C, and the flasks were shaken at 150 rpm for 16 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed in 40 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and resuspended in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (buffer A). The suspension was incubated with lysozyme for 30 min at room temperature and then sonicated. The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min and the supernatant collected. Analysis by SDS-PAGE showed that a large percentage of the expressed protein was in the cytoplasmic fraction of the cell extract. Calculation of the isoelectric point of C36R66 (using the PEPTIDESORT module of GCG) indicated that it is quite basic (Pi = 10.1). Accordingly, Q-Sepharose (Fast-Flow; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to remove most of the soluble protein in the sample in a batch procedure. A slurry of Q-Sepharose (25 g) in 40 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, was added to the cell supernatant. After stirring for 1 h on ice, the Q-Sepharose was removed by filtration and washed with buffer A. The filtrate was saved and the Q-Sepharose washed further with buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl. The C36R66 peptide was contained in the initial filtrate, as determined by SDS-PAGE. The filtrate obtained after Q-Sepharose purification was dialyzed against 40 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8 (buffer B), and applied to a column of SP-Sepharose (Fast-Flow, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer B. The column was eluted with a gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl buffer B. The pooled fractions containing C36R66 (as determined by SDS-PAGE) were concentrated by ultrafiltration, applied to a Sephacryl S-200 column, and eluted with 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Two peaks of purified C36R66 were obtained. SDS-PAGE in the absence of reducing agents suggested that the early eluting peak was due to a disulfide-linked dimer and that the second peak was a monomer. Addition of dithiothreitol (DTT) (to 1.0 mm) to the dimeric fractions resulted in a single band consistent in size with the monomeric protein. The gel filtration fractions containing DTT and those without DTT were pooled separately and concentrated by ultrafiltration. The DTT-containing fractions were further submitted to TSK SW 2000 molecular sieving chromatography to remove contaminating DTT, which interferes in the platelet aggregation assays, performed as above. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was obtained by platelet-pheresis from medication-free platelet donors at the DTM/NIH blood bank under the direction of Dr. S. Leitmann. Washed human platelets were prepared by centrifugation of PRP at room temperature as described (45.Lagrue A.-H. Francischetti I.M.B. Guimarães J.A. Jandrot-Perrus M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Fresh bovine blood was obtained from NIH-Poolesville (Frederick, MD) and collected in acid/citric/dextrose (ACD, 1:10); platelet-rich plasma was obtained by centrifugation of blood at 180 × g for 10 min at room temperature. Fresh rabbit blood was obtained from Spring Valley Laboratories (Woodbine, MD), collected in heparin (0.1 units/ml), and platelet-rich plasma obtained by centrifugation of blood at 375 × g for 12 min at room temperature as described (46.Francischetti I.M.B.

Human platelet-poor plasma was obtained by centrifugation of PRP for 5 min at 14,000 ×g at room temperature. For platelet adhesion assays, platelet-rich plasma was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with calcein-AM (2 μm) followed by washing and recovering of the cells as described above. Platelet aggregation assays were performed on a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA) as described previously with further modifications (34.Valenzuela J.G. Charlab R. Galperin M.Y. Ribeiro J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30583-30590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The use of microplate assays has been shown to give quantitatively and qualitatively similar results when compared with Born aggregometry (47.Bednar B. Condra C. Gould R.J. Connolly T.M. Thromb. Res. 1995; 77: 453-463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, 30–50 μl of Tyrode/BSA were mixed in 96-well flat-bottom plates (Falcon 3912; Becton Dickinson, Oxnard, CA) in the presence of the indicated agonists and reconstituted column fractions or recombinant peptide. When thrombin was used as an agonist, Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro amide (1 mm) was added to prevent clotting. Aggregation was initiated by the addition of 50 μl of human platelet-rich plasma. The plate was stirred on a microplate mixer (Series 4732; Cole Palmer, Vernon Hills, IL) for 5 s before being transferred to the microplate reader, where the turbidity change at 650 nm was measured in units of absorbance every 11 s with agitation between readings. In some experiments, platelet aggregation and shape change were monitored using"
https://openalex.org/W2004747143,"Trans-activation of the activating transcription factor-2 (ATF2) in response to cellular stress requires the N-terminal phosphorylation of ATF2 by stress-activated protein kinases (SAPK). In this study, we investigated the role of ATF2 phosphorylation in the maintenance of ATF2 stability. Activation of SAPK by forced expression of ΔMEKK1 increased overall ATF2 ubiquitination, presumably because of the enhanced dimerization of ATF2. Treatment of ΔMEKK1-expressing cells with okadaic acid led to the increase in N-terminal phosphorylation, protection from ubiquitination, and accumulation of exogenously expressed ATF2, indicating the role of protein phosphatases in balancing the effects of stress kinases. Analysis of ubiquitination and degradation of the constitutively dimerized ATF2 mutant (ATF2Δ150–248) showed that activation of JNK or p38 kinase renders ATF2 resistant to ubiquitination and degradation. This effect is mediated by JNK/p38-dependent phosphorylation of ATF2 at Thr-69 and Thr-71, because the phosphorylation-deficient mutant (ATF2Δ150–248-T69A,T71A) was not protected from ubiquitination and degradation by the activation of SAPK. Treatment of cells with okadaic acid elevated the tumor necrosis factor α-induced ATF2 level and the extent of its specific N-terminal phosphorylation. Cycloheximide, which activates SAPK, while inhibiting protein synthesis, stabilized endogenous ATF2. However, treatment of cells with the high dose of SB203580, which inhibits JNK and p38 kinase, resulted in efficient degradation of ATF2 in cells exposed to cycloheximide. This degradation was abrogated by co-treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Our findings suggest that N-terminal phosphorylation of ATF2 dimers protect ATF2 from ubiquitination and degradation. We propose the hypothesis that the balance between SAPK and protein phosphatases affects the duration and magnitude of ATF2 transcriptional output because of the effect on substrate recognition for ubiquitination and degradation.

Although the products of ATF2 target genes have been implicated in the contribution to neoplastic processes and inflammation, the physiological role of ATF2 remains largely uncharacterized. Under nonstress growth conditions, ATF2 exhibits a low level of transactivation because of an intramolecular inhibitory interaction in which the C-terminal DNA binding domain is bound to the N-terminal transactivating domain (11.Li X.Y. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Association of ATF2 with viral proteins, such as adenovirus E1A, hepatitis B virus protein X, or human T-cell leukemia virus type I protein Tax, stimulates its transcriptional activity (12.Liu F.

N-terminal phosphorylation of ATF2 in response to stress has been demonstrated to relieve intramolecular inhibition (15.Abdel-Hafiz H.A. Heasley L.E. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Kroll D.J. Johnson G.L. Hoeffler J.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2079-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and increase transcriptional activation of ATF2 (4.van Dam H. Wilhelm D. Herr I. Steffen A. Herrlich P.

Phosphorylation of amino acid residues Thr-69 and Thr-71 is mediated by stress-activated protein kinases (SAPK) including Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK, 4, 5, 16) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (17.Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). Transcriptionally active ATF2 recognizes and binds specific ATF/cAMP-response element motifs as a homo- or heterodimer. ATF2 interacts with various heterodimerization partners depending on the cell type. The ubiquitin proteasome pathway-dependent degradation is an important means of regulating ATF2 activity (18.Firestein R. Feuerstein N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5892-5902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 19.Fuchs S.Y. Ronai Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3289-3298Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that in vitro ubiquitination of ATF2, as well as of c-Jun, JunB, and p53, is targeted by association with JNK (20.Fuchs S.Y. Dolan L. Davis R.J. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1531-1535PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Fuchs S.Y. Xie B. Adler V. Fried V.A. Davis R.J. Ronai Z. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2658-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). JNK targeting of its associated proteins for ubiquitination is phosphorylation-dependent. In recent studies, we have shown that leucine zipper based heterodimerization with c-Jun, which is one of key ATF2 partners, facilitates ATF2 ubiquitination and degradation (19.Fuchs S.Y. Ronai Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3289-3298Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Overexpression of c-junincreased ATF2 ubiquitination and decreased its half-life. Increased ubiquitination and decreased stability were also found in a constitutively active spliced form of ATF2, which lacks amino acids 150–248 (19.Fuchs S.Y. Ronai Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3289-3298Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Two possible mechanisms of the effect of ATF2 N-terminal phosphorylation in the regulation of its transcriptional activity can be envisioned. First, phosphorylation-mediated conformational changes leading to disruption of intramolecular inhibition are expected to enhance ATF2 dimerization and DNA binding (15.Abdel-Hafiz H.A. Heasley L.E. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Kroll D.J. Johnson G.L. Hoeffler J.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2079-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, we found that, unlike stable ATF2 engaged in this inhibitory interaction, the homo- and heterodimers of ATF2 are rapidly ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome pathway (19.Fuchs S.Y. Ronai Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3289-3298Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Second, it is also possible that, in addition to favoring dimerization, SAPK-mediated phosphorylation may stabilize ATF2, as in the case with c-Jun (20.Fuchs S.Y. Dolan L. Davis R.J. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1531-1535PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Musti A.M. Treier M. Bohmann D. Science. 1997; 275: 400-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Previously, we observed that N-terminal phosphorylation of ATF2 by JNK precludes ATF2 ubiquitination in vitro (21.Fuchs S.Y. Xie B. Adler V. Fried V.A. Davis R.J. Ronai Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32163-32168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to investigate the role of SAPK in preventing ubiquitination and degradation of ATF2 in vivo. We provide evidence for the role of ATF2 phosphorylation per se, as a consequence of kinase and phosphatase activities, in the regulation of ATF2 stabilityin vivo. Our results suggest that the maintenance of phosphorylation status of ATF2 may be crucial in determining the duration of ATF2 transactivation.

Point mutations to substitute Thr-69 and Thr-71 for alanines were generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis with the aid of a QuickChange kit (Stratagene). The integrity of each construct was confirmed by partial DNA sequencing, in vitro translation, and immunoblotting. TIG normal human fibroblasts (a kind gift of H. Tahara) and 293T human embryo kidney cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum and antibiotics at 37 °C with 5% CO2. 293T cells were transfected using the CaPO4 method. The total amount of DNA within the experiments was kept constant by adding the respective empty vector plasmid DNA to the transfection mixtures. The experiments were repeated at least three times, and the representative figures are shown. In vivo ubiquitination was assayed as described by Treier et al. (24.Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). His-ATF2 (4 μg) was co-transfected into 293T cells with ubiquitin-HA vector (3 μg). Twenty four hours later, cells were lysed with 6 mguanidinium HCl, and his-tagged proteins were purified by nickel resins as described by Treier et al. (24.Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), separated by 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to Hybond C nitrocellulose filter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The filter was cut just above the 71-kDa protein molecular mass marker, and its lower part was analyzed by means of immunoblotting using anti-ATF2 antibody to identify nickel-purified hisATF2. The upper part of the filter was probed with anti-HA antibody, allowing detection of the smear, which represented slower migrating ubiquitin-HA conjugates. The experiments were repeated at least three times, and the representative figures are shown. 293T cells were transfected with pCMV-ATF2Δ150–248-HA or pCMV-ATF2Δ150–248 T69A,T71A-HA (5 μg) constructs and pCMV-ASK1ΔN(2 μg) as indicated. Twenty four hours later the cells were incubated with methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed calf serum for 1 h and then metabolically labeled with 0.5 mCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine mix (PRO-MIX, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The labeling was chased with complete medium supplemented with 2 mm cold methionine and cysteine for the times indicated. Cells were lysed, and the ATF2 proteins were immunopurified using HA antibody as described previously (19.Fuchs S.Y. Ronai Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3289-3298Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated material was resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gels were fixed, impregnated with Amplify reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), dried, and subjected to autoradiography. The experiments were repeated at least three times, and the representative figures are shown. Quantitation was performed using NIH Image 1.61 Software. In previous studies, we established the in vivoubiquitination of ATF2. In these transient transfection-based experiments his-tagged ATF2 is co-expressed with Ub-HA (19.Fuchs S.Y. Ronai Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3289-3298Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Using nickel beads, ATF2 is purified under denaturating conditions, and the amount of HA-tagged polyubiquitin chains covalently linked to ATF2 is then assessed by immunoblotting. Although the ubiquitination of exogenous ATF2 could not be detected in melanoma or fibroblast cells, even in the presence of proteasome inhibitors, using 293 cells, it was possible to determine the degree of ATF2 ubiquitination in vivo (19.Fuchs S.Y. Ronai Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3289-3298Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Activation of stress kinases p38 and JNK by the common upstream kinase MEKK1, in its constitutively active form (ΔMEKK1), increased overall ATF2 ubiquitination (Fig.1). This effect requires the catalytic activity of MEKK1, because co-expression of its kinase dead mutant (MEKK1-TR) did not lead to an increase in ATF2 ubiquitination levels. The lack of effect of MEKK1-TR cannot be explained by the difference in the level of expression of active and inactive kinase (Fig. 1,lower panel). Because in vitro assays revealed that JNK-mediated phosphorylation of ATF2 protects it from ubiquitination (12.Liu F. Green M.R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1217-1224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), the data shown in Fig. 1 suggest that additional factors may affect ATF2 phosphorylation status and its ubiquitination and degradation rates in vivo. One such factor is the activity of protein phosphatases. To test this possibility, we treated ΔMEKK1-transfected cells with okadaic acid, as a general inhibitor of protein phosphatases (28.Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2146) Google Scholar). Forced expression of ΔMEKK1, but not MEKK1-TR, in OA-treated cells, led to the accumulation of exogenously expressed ATF2 (Fig.2 A). This result indicates that phosphatase activity prevents ATF2 stabilization under conditions when JNK is activated. A 4-fold increase in the level of ATF2 phosphorylation on N-terminal residues, measured by phospho-specific antibodies, was seen in ΔMEKK1-expressing cells treated with okadaic acid (Fig. 2 B). This observation suggests that under conditions when stress kinases are activated, ATF2 stability correlates with its phosphorylation level. Activation of stress kinases by the expression of a constitutively active form of MEKK1 can no longer increase ATF2 ubiquitination when the phosphatase activity is inhibited by okadaic acid (Fig.2 C). Because N-terminal phosphorylation was shown to disrupt the intramolecular inhibitory interaction between the ATF2 leucine zipper and its transactivation domain, thereby leading to ATF2 dimerization, our data suggest that although ATF2 dimers are phosphorylated by stress kinases, they are resistant to ubiquitination and degradation. To test this hypothesis directly, we assessed the ubiquitination and degradation of ATF2 forms whose dimerization status is not affected by N-terminal phosphorylation. To this end, we used the human analog of a spliced form of murine ATF2, which lacks amino acids 150–248. We previously confirmed that this mutant primarily exists as a transcriptionally active dimer and, hence, is very sensitive to ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation (19.Fuchs S.Y. Ronai Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3289-3298Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Activation of JNK by overexpression of a constitutively active form of JNKK (JNKKCAA) or activation of p38 by overexpression of a constitutively active form of MKK6 (MKK6D/D) protects ATF2Δ150–248 from ubiquitination in vivo. This protection apparently depends on the phosphorylation of ATF2 protein by JNK or p38 at Thr-69 and Thr-71, because the ubiquitination of the mutant ATF2Δ150–248-T69,71A form (where threonines 69 and 71 were mutated to alanines in the context of ATF2Δ150–248) is not affected by activation of stress kinases (Fig. 3 A). In vivo degradation, measured by pulse-chase analysis, has also demonstrated that ATF2Δ150–248 (but not ATF2Δ150–248-T69A,T71A) is stabilized by overexpression of a constitutively active ASK1ΔN, which causes co-activation of JNK/p38 pathways (Fig. 3 B), thereby confirming the observations we obtained with the in vivoubiquitination assay. These data provide strong evidence for a protective role of SAPK-mediated N-terminal phosphorylation of ATF2 dimers against its ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation. To investigate the role of N-terminal phosphorylation in the regulation of the stability of endogenous ATF2, we sought to find a correlation between ATF2 phosphorylation status and the level of its accumulation in normal human fibroblasts before and after stress treatment. We have used TNFα and UV irradiation as physiological stimuli, which are known to result in the activation of stress kinases and treatment with okadaic acid to inhibit phosphatase activity. Elevated levels of ATF2 were observed in normal human fibroblasts treated with TNFα and OA when compared with TNFα alone (Fig. 4,upper panel). Higher expression of ATF2 under OA+TNFα treatment coincided with the elevated specific N-terminal phosphorylation level as measured by immunoblotting with a phospho-specific antibody (Fig. 4). Similar observations were made when cells were subjected to treatment with UV and OA (not shown). These results indicate that ATF2 steady-state levels correlate with its N-terminal phosphorylation status. To further assess the role of SAPK in the regulation of ATF2 stability, we have followed up the half-life of endogenous ATF2. Cycloheximide treatment allows ATF2 levels to be monitored under conditions where protein synthesis is inhibited and stress kinases are activated (29.Zinck R. Cahill M.A. Kracht M. Sachsenmaier C. Hipskind R.A. Nordheim A Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4930-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Under such conditions we observed that endogenous ATF2 is stable over 8 h of cycloheximide treatment. Treatment of human fibroblasts with the high dose of SB 203580 (100 μm), which is known to inhibit both JNK and p38 kinase (26.Chen C.Y. Del Gatto-Konczak F. Wu Z. Karin M. Science. 1998; 280: 1945-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), resulted in efficient degradation of ATF2 in cells exposed to cycloheximide (Fig.5). Simultaneous exposure of normal human fibroblasts to cycloheximide, SB 203580, and the proteasome inhibitor MG132 restored ATF2 stability. These data suggest that phosphorylation of ATF2 by stress kinases protects ATF2 from proteasome-mediated degradation. One of the open questions in understanding the regulation of transcriptional activities relates to factors which contribute to the duration and magnitude of these activities. Although ATF2 phosphorylation by stress kinases is required for the transcriptional activities of ATF2, the cellular determinants that limit those activities are not well understood. We previously demonstrated that stress kinases target the ubiquitination of their transcription factor substrates in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. The emerging model, which was proven correct for the regulation of c-Jun, p53, and, presently, ATF2 stability, is the following. Although these transcription factors are not phosphorylated, they serve as good substrates for JNK association and subsequent targeting for ubiquitination, which is the scenario encountered under nonstressed normal growth conditions. Upon stress induction, the activation of the stress kinases results in the respective phosphorylation of their substrates, leading to their protection from JNK targeting. Here we demonstrate that protection of the activated substrates is maintained as long as the protein remains phosphorylated. Thus, the length of time during which ATF2 is phosphorylated directly represents the duration of its protection from ubiquitination. This is the window of time when ATF2 is expected to be transcriptionally active (Fig.6). The case of ATF2 may represent other transcription factors, which possess the characteristics of intramolecular inhibition, in addition to the ability to mediate transactivation as homodimers. The finding that ATF2 dimerization with other basic region-leucine zipper proteins increases its basal level of ubiquitination thereby facilitating its degradation denotes an important regulatory aspect of ATF2 stability (19.Fuchs S.Y. Ronai Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3289-3298Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The latter observation established that through its association with c-Jun, ATF2 has a shortened half-life, thereby establishing one mechanism by which duration of transcriptional output is limited. At the same time, ATF2 is known to acquire its transcriptional activity upon stress kinase-mediated N-terminal phosphorylation, even in the absence of c-Jun (4.van Dam H. Wilhelm D. Herr I. Steffen A. Herrlich P. Angel P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1798-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Here we propose that the time frame that enables the transcriptional output of ATF2 is limited to the amount of time during which phospho-groups remain on the dimerized ATF2 forms (Fig. 6). Our results point to the active role of protein phosphatases in facilitating the degree of protein ubiquitination and respective degradation, although the phosphatase species responsible for this regulation in vivo are yet to be identified. Our findings provide the explanation as to why the degree of kinase activity does not directly reflect the activity of its transcription factor substrates. Consequently, our studies provide direct evidence for an important mechanism that underlies the stability of the transcriptional complex. Phosphorylation by either p38 or JNK is sufficient to acquire a transcriptionally active component, which is protected from ubiquitination and degradation whereas the protein phosphatases do not remove the phospho groups from the protein. A similar mode of regulation was recently reported for Bcl2, which is protected from ubiquitination and degradation by extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2-mediated phosphorylation in human endothelial cells (30.Dimmeler S. Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1815-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase activity (31.Vrana J.A. Grant S. Dent P. Radiat. Res. 1999; 151: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and/or activation of mitochondrial PP2A protein phosphatase (32.Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Ito T. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20296-20300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) in response to treatments with TNFα, ionizing radiation, or ceramide, result in dephosphorylation and proteasome-dependent degradation of Bcl2, which is required for apoptosis. The case of ATF2 presented here illustrates the ability of multiple stress kinases, activated by alternate stress stimuli, to render the same output. This suggests that although ATF2 phosphorylation by either p38 or JNK will render it equally competent for association with other transcription factors, the nature of specific signal transduction pathways sustaining transcriptional output is likely to depend on the cell type and stimuli given. Another similar type of regulation is expected to occur in the case of transcription factors that are phosphorylated on different residues by multiple kinases, as shown for p53 (reviewed in Ref. 33.Prives C. Hall P.A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). Our proposed model should also reflect p53, because it is the type of stress and expressed transcription factors that would define the nature of the complex and its respective output. The current studies provide evidence to support the hypothesis that protein phosphatases affect the duration and magnitude of ATF2 transcriptional output primarily because of their effect on substrate recognition for ubiquitination and degradation. Thus, one mean, by which the transcriptional output may be regulated, would rely on respective modulation of a specific protein phosphatase activity. We thank Drs. Bohmann, Minden, Ichijo, and Karin for the gift of stress kinase constructs. We are grateful to D. Alarcon-Vargas for the help in the manuscript preparation."

Full-Text PDF Open Access open reading frame untranslated region 2,6-dichloroindophenol glycolate oxidase peroxisome targeting sequence type 1 base pair(s) The oxidative metabolism of fatty acids can proceed by either of two distinct pathways, α-oxidation or β-oxidation (1.Wanders R.J. Tager J.M. Mol. Aspects Med. 1998; 19: 69-154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fatty acid β-oxidation, which shortens the carbon chain by two-carbon increments, generates cellular energy through the release of reducing equivalents and acetyl-CoA. In contrast, fatty acid α-oxidation shortens fatty acids in one-carbon increments, and its contribution to energy production, if any, is unknown. One function of fatty acid α-oxidation in humans appears to be in converting 3-methyl branched fatty acids, such as phytanic acid, to 2-methyl branched fatty acids, which can then be oxidized further by peroxisomal and mitochondrial β-oxidation pathways. Complete α-oxidation pathways have been detected in organisms as diverse as plants and mammals (2.Kishimoto Y. Akanuma H. Singh I. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1979; 28: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 3.Hamberg M. Sanz A. Castresana C. J. Biol.

In humans, the first steps the in the α-oxidation of fatty acids involve their activation to CoA esters (4.Watkins P.A. Howard A.E. Gould S.J. Avigan J. Mihalik S.J. J. Lipid. Res. 1996; 37: 2288-2295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the subsequent hydroxylation by a dioxygenase, PAHX, generating 2-hydroxyacyl CoAs (5.Mihalik S. Morrell J. Kim D. Sacksteder K. Watkins P. Gould S. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 6.Mihalik S.J. Rainville A.M. Watkins P.A. Eur. J.

The currently favored model invokes a 2-hydroxyacyl-CoA lyase to generate formyl CoA and a shortened fatty aldehyde, which can then be dehydrogenated to regenerate a fatty acid (1.Wanders R.J.

Alternatively, some reports indicate that fatty acid α-oxidation may involve the generation of a 2-keto intermediate (12.Wanders R.J.A. van Roermund C.W.T. Schor D.S.M. ten Brink H.J. Jakobs C. J.

The 2-keto acid could then undergo decarboxylation to yield a fatty aldehyde, which could then be dehydrogenated to the corresponding acid. Although it is unclear whether 2-hydroxy acid oxidases contribute to a general mechanism of fatty acid α-oxidation, there is abundant evidence that these enzymes can oxidize a broad range of 2-hydroxy acids, ranging from glycolate to long chain 2-hydroxy fatty acids such as 2-hydroxypalmitate (16.Angermuller S. Progr. Histochem. Cytochem. 1989; 20: 42-45Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 17.Fry D.W. Richardson K.E. Biochim. Biophys.

These enzymes utilize a flavin cofactor and convert 2-hydroxy acids to 2-keto acids with the concomitant reduction of molecular oxygen to hydrogen peroxide. The most well studied enzyme of this family is the plant glycolate oxidase, an enzyme with an essential role in photorespiration (19.Tolbert N.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 133-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 20.Volokita M. Somerville C.R. J. Biol.

Glycolate oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of glycolate to glyoxylate as well as the oxidation of glyoxylate to oxalate. Mammals also contain significant 2-hydroxy acid oxidase activities. These have been detected in both liver and kidney (16.Angermuller S. Progr. Histochem. Cytochem. 1989; 20: 42-45Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 17.Fry D.W. Richardson K.E. Biochim. Biophys.

The liver isozyme has been reported to be most active on glycolate, while the kidney isozyme is thought to prefer longer chain substrates. Although two distinct rodent genes encoding 2-hydroxy acid oxidases have been described (24.Diep Le K.H. Lederer F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2401-2407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), there is as yet no thorough analysis of human 2-hydroxy acid oxidases, their patterns of expression, or their substrate specificities. We report here the results of a search for human 2-hydroxy acid oxidases. We identified three human homologs of plant glycolate oxidase, HAOX1, HAOX2, andHAOX3. Each gene encodes a peroxisomal protein with 2-hydroxy acid oxidase activity. However, each gene has a distinct, tissue-specific pattern of expression, and each protein has distinct substrate preferences. These results and their implications for 2-hydroxy acid metabolism are discussed. Candidate HAOX cDNAs were identified by scanning the data base of expressed sequence tags for human cDNAs capable of encoding proteins with sequence similarity to spinach glycolate oxidase (GOX). Multiple cDNA clones were identified, and these corresponded to three distinct genes, which we refer to as HAOX1,HAOX2, and HAOX3. The HAOX1 cDNA was assembled from two overlapping cDNA clones as follows: aBamHI/SalI fragment was excised from the cDNA clone IMAGE: 84824 (GenBankTM accession no. T74667) and ligated between the BamHI and SalI sites of the cDNA clone IMAGE: 77520 (GenBankTM accession no.T58830). The HAOX2 cDNA was assembled in a similar manner, by inserting an Asp718/NotI fragment of the cDNA clone IMAGE: 434823 (GenBankTM accession no.AA703164) between the Asp718 and NotI sites of the cDNA clone IMAGE: 245519 (GenBankTM accession no.N72519). The entire HAOX3 open reading frame (ORF)1 was present on a single cDNA clone, IMAGE: 531512 (GenBankTM accession no. AA075839). Two forms of the HAOX1 ORF were amplified from the completeHAOX1 cDNA. The HAOX1 ORF was amplified using the primers 5′-CCCGGATCCATGCTCCCCCGGCTAATTTCTATC-3′ and 5′-CCCGCGGCCGCTCACAACTACGAAACGGCCAAAGGATTTTTC-3′. A form of the HAOX1 ORF lacking the final two codons (HAOX1ΔKI) was also amplified using the first primer above together with the primer 5′-CCCGCGGCCGCTCACATCTACGAAACGGCCAAAGGATTTTTC-3′. Both sets of primers append BamHI and NotI sites (underlined) to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the HAOX1 ORF, respectively. The PCR product from each reaction was digested with BamHI andNotI and cloned between the BamHI andNotI sites of pMBP (27.Geisbrecht B.V. Zhu D. Schulz K. Nau K. Morrell J.C. Geraghty M. Schulz H.

The HAOX1 ORF was excised from pMBP-HAOX1 and inserted between theBamHI and NotI sites of pcDNA3-Nmyc (28.Jones J.M. Nau K. Geraghty M.T. Erdmann R. Gould S.J. J. Biol.

The same fragment was also inserted between the BamHI and NotI sites of pET28a (Novagen), a bacterial expression plasmid designed to express proteins in fusion with an amino-terminal 6-histidine tag, creating pET28a-HAOX1. The HAOX2 ORF was amplified using the primers 5′-CCCGTCGACCATGTCCTTGGTGTGTTTGACAGAC-3′ and 5′-CAAGCGGCCGCTTACAGCCTGGAAAACTGGACCAAG-3′. These primers append SalI and NotI sites to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the HAOX2 ORF, respectively. The PCR product was digested with SalI and NotI and cloned between theXhoI and NotI sites of pcDNA3-Nmyc to make pcDNA3-Nmyc/HAOX2. The HAOX2 ORF was excised from this plasmid by digestion with BamHI and NotI and inserted into the corresponding sites of pET28a to make pET28a-HAOX2. Two forms of the HAOX3 ORF were amplified from theHAOX3 cDNA. The HAOX3 ORF was amplified using the primers 5′-CCCGTCGACGATGTCTTTGCTGTGTGTTTGGCAG-3′ and 5′-CCCGCGGCCGCTTATAATCTGGAGAACTGAATCAG-3′. A form of the HAOX3 ORF lacking the final two codons (HAOX3ΔRL) was amplified using the oligonucleotide 5′-CCCGCGGCCGCTTATAATCAGGAGAACTGAATCAG-3′ in conjunction with the first primer above. Both sets of primers appendSalI and NotI sites to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the ORF, respectively. The HAOX3 PCR product was digested withSalI and NotI and inserted into the corresponding sites of pT7-His6 (29.Geisbrecht B.V. Zhang D. Schulz H. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21797-21803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) to make pT7-His6/HAOX3. The HAOX3 ORF was then excised from pT7-His6/HAOX3 by digestion with SalI and NotI and inserted into theXhoI and NotI sites of pcDNA3-Nmyc to make pcDNA3-Nmyc/HAOX3. The HAOX3ΔRL product was digested with SalI and NotI and inserted into the corresponding sites in pMBP to make pMBP-HAOX3ΔKL. The sequences of all polymerase chain reaction-generated clones were confirmed using automated fluorescent sequencing. All bacterial manipulations were performed in the Escherichia coli strain DH10B (30.Grant S.G. Jessee J. Bloom F.R. Hanahan D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4645-4649Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar) except expression of proteins from pET28a and pHis6 vectors, which was performed in the strain BL21/DE3 (Novagen). Northern blot analysis was performed using standard protocols (31.Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and human multitissue Northern blots fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). High stringency wash conditions were used (0.2× SSC, 50% formamide, 45 °C) to reduce the possibility of cross-reactivity. The probe for HAOX1transcript detection was derived from a polymerase chain reaction product of the entire HAOX1 ORF. Due to the high sequence similarity of HAOX2 and HAOX3, regions of the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) were used to make probes. ForHAOX2, the HAOX2 cDNA clone was digested withDraIII and NotI, and a restriction fragment corresponding to the 3′-UTR was used as probe. AnHAOX3-specific probe was generated by polymerase chain reaction using the primer 5′-CTACGAGATTGCCTACAAGAG-3′ in conjunction with a primer designed to anneal to the T7 promoter site in theHAOX3 cDNA clone. For protein expression in human skin fibroblasts, GM5756-T cells were cultured and transfected as described (32.Chang C.-C. Lee W.-H. Moser H.W. Valle D. Gould S.J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Two days after electroporation, cells were washed once in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Life Technologies), harvested by gentle scraping, washed once in 100 mm KPi (pH 7.5), 10 mmEDTA, and then resuspended briskly in 500 μl of 100 mmKPi, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100 for lysis. 2-Hydroxy acid oxidase activity was measured by a method similar to that of Schuman and Massey (22.Schuman M. Massey V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 227: 500-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Specifically, 50 μl of each lysate was added to a mixture of 100 mm KPi, 10 mm EDTA, 100 μm 2,6-dichloroindophenol (DCIP). The reaction was started by the addition of a 500 μm concentration of the indicated substrate, and the change in A 605 was measured over time. Reactions were carried out in a final volume of 1 ml at room temperature (18 °C). An extinction coefficient of 110.26 μm−1 cm−1 for DCIP at 605 nm was used for all calculations. One unit of activity is defined as the reduction of 1 μmol of DCIP in 1 min. The protein concentration of each lysate was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay (New England Biolabs). For immunoblot, 10 μg of protein from each lysate was separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a membrane. Detection was by standard protocols as described (32.Chang C.-C. Lee W.-H. Moser H.W. Valle D. Gould S.J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) using a commercially available anti-c-myc polyclonal antibody (Jackson Immunochemicals). BL21/DE3 cells harboring the appropriate His6-HAOX expression plasmid were grown overnight at 37 °C in 50-ml cultures of Luria broth supplemented with 25 μg/ml kanamycin. This culture was added to 1 liter of 2YT medium containing 25 μg/ml kanamycin and grown at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.4. The cultures were then cooled to room temperature (18 °C), induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm, and grown overnight at 18 °C with vigorous shaking. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 25 ml of binding buffer (20 mm NaPi (pH 7.8), 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm benzamidine HCl) containing 1% Triton X-100, 8 μg/ml DNase, and 8 μg/ml RNase. Cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen, thawed, and lysed by mixing. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was then diluted to 50 ml in binding buffer and applied at a rate of 1.5 ml/min to a 2-ml bed of chelating Sepharose fast-flow resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) previously charged with NiCl and equilibrated in binding buffer. The bound resin was washed with 50 bed volumes of pH 7.8 binding buffer followed by 10 bed volumes of binding buffer containing 5 mm EDTA, 50 mmimidazole and adjusted to pH 6.0. an imidazole/EDTA step gradient was used to elute bound proteins. Specifically, three steps of 2.5 bed volumes each of pH 7.8 binding buffer containing 200 mmimidazole, 5 mm EDTA, 300 mm imidazole plus 10 mm EDTA, and 500 mm imidazole plus 50 mm EDTA were applied sequentially to the resin. Fractions were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for the presence and purity of His6-HAOX proteins. Fractions containing purified His6-HAOX proteins were pooled, stabilized with glycerol, and stored at 4 °C. Substrate comparison studies were performed as for whole cell lysates using 15 μg of protein. For kinetic studies, 15 μg of protein was added to a mixture of 100 mm KPi (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA, and 150 μm DCIP. To start the reaction, substrate was added in various concentrations ranging from 5 μm to 1 mm, and the change in A 605 was monitored with time. Indirect immunofluorescence studies were performed on normal human skin fibroblasts (GM5756-T cells) or the PEX10-deficient fibroblast cell line, PBD100, which was derived from a Zellweger syndrome patient and has been described previously (33.Warren D.S. Morrell J.C. Moser H.W. Valle D. Gould S.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 347-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cell lines were cultured and transfected as described (32.Chang C.-C. Lee W.-H. Moser H.W. Valle D. Gould S.J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). After transfection, cells were transferred to cover glasses and incubated in complete medium at 37 °C for 1 day. The cells were fixed, permeabilized, and processed for indirect immunofluorescence as described (32.Chang C.-C. Lee W.-H. Moser H.W. Valle D. Gould S.J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Permeabilization was normally performed for 5 min with 1% Triton X-100, which permeabilizes both the plasma and peroxisome membranes. For selective permeabilization of only the plasma membrane, cells were incubated for 5 min in 25 μg/ml digitonin instead of Triton X-100. Guinea pig anti-PMP70 antibodies were raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 18 amino acids of human PMP70 (34.Gartner J. Moser H. Valle D. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 16-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The anti-c-myc mouse monoclonal antibody was derived from tissue culture medium of the mouse hybridoma line 1-9E10 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Fluorescent secondary antibodies were obtained from commercial sources. Subcellular fractionation of rat liver was as described by Mihalik (35.Mihalik S.J. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1992; 357: 239-244Google Scholar). Anti-HAOX1 and anti-HAOX3 antibodies were raised in rabbits against MBP-HAOX1ΔKI and MBP-HAOX3ΔRL, respectively. Antibodies were affinity-purified using the appropriate MBP fusion protein coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (28.Jones J.M. Nau K. Geraghty M.T. Erdmann R. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9216-9223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Antibodies obtained were stored in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25% glycerol, 0.04% NaN3 at 4 °C. Immunoblots were performed as described by Crane et al. (36.Crane D.I. Kalish J.E. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21835-21844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of spinach GOX was used to scan the data base of expressed sequence tags for all human homologs. Multiple expressed sequence tags were identified, and these corresponded to three distinct genes, HAOX1,HAOX2, and HAOX3. The human HAOX1cDNA (Fig. 1) is 1743 bp long and contains a 1113-bp ORF, with 24 bp of 5′-UTR and 606 bp of 3′-UTR. The sequence surrounding the indicated start codon (GTGAAAATGC) is a partial match to the Kozak start site consensus (GCC(A/G)CCATG(G/A)) (37.Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar). All subsequent possible start sites are also only in partial agreement with this consensus sequence until the methionine codon at position 312, roughly one-third of the way into the region of high amino acid identity with plant GOX. This, combined with the finding that two in-frame termination codons precede the proposed start site at positions −12 and −18 (Fig. 1, double underline), make the indicated methionine codon the most likely translation initiation site. A consensus polyadenylation site is present in the 3′-UTR (Fig. 1, boldface type). The deduced protein product is 370 amino acids long, has a predicted molecular mass of 41 kDa, and terminates in the sequence serine-lysine-isoleucine, which resembles the type 1 peroxisome targeting sequence (PTS1) (underlined) (38.Gould S.J. Keller G.A. Hosken N. Wilkinson J. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). The region from position 659 to 966 matches the sequence of a sequence-tagged site, SHGC-3321, which has been mapped to the short arm of chromosome 20, 58.49 centirays from the top of the linkage group. The HAOX2 cDNA sequence (Fig.2) is 1417 bp long and contains a 1056-bp ORF, with 73 bp of 5′-UTR and 288 bp of 3′-UTR. The sequence surrounding the indicated initiation site (CAGAAAATGT) is only a partial match to the Kozak initiation consensus. However, the next methionine codon occurs at nucleotide position 268, well into a region of highly conserved sequence. In addition, in-frame termination codons are present in the 5′-UTR at positions −12 and −64 (Fig. 2,double underline). The deduced protein product ofHAOX2 is 351 amino acids long, has a predicted molecular mass of 39 kDa, and terminates in the consensus PTS1 serine-arginine-leucine (Fig. 2, underline). The region from position 458 to 562 corresponds to the chromosome 1 sequence-tagged site, stSG32829. The HAOX3 cDNA sequence (Fig.3) is 1821 bp long and contains a 1062-bp ORF, with a 171-bp 5′-UTR and a 588-bp 3′-UTR. Like theHAOX1 and HAOX2 cDNAs, the sequence surrounding the apparent initiation codon (CCAGCAATGT) is only a partial match to the Kozak initiation consensus. Again, subsequent possible initiation methionines are a significant distance into the region of high amino acid identity with GOX, and the indicated initiation site is preceded by an in-frame stop codon (Fig. 3, position −45, double underline). The deduced protein product is 353 amino acids long, has a predicted molecular mass of 39 kDa, and also terminates in the consensus PTS1, serine-arginine-leucine. The chromosomal location of theHAOX3 gene is unknown. Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of HAOX1, HAOX2, HAOX3 and spinach GOX shows that HAOX1 shares the highest identity with the spinach enzyme (54.6%) (Fig. 4). HAOX2 and HAOX3 are more distantly related to plant GOX and have only 46.7 and 44.8% identity, respectively. However, HAOX2 and HAOX3 are closely related and share 70.4% sequence identity to one another, as opposed to only 46.0 and 45.3% identity to HAOX1, respectively. Northern blot studies were performed to determine which tissues expressed these three candidate 2-hydroxy acid oxidase genes. A radiolabeled probe specific for each gene was hybridized to poly(A)+ RNA from 16 different tissues (Fig.5). The same filters were used for all three experiments. Long exposures are provided so that low levels of transcript may be seen. For HAOX1 (top panel), a ∼2.0-kilobase transcript was present at high levels in liver but at very low levels in kidney. A very small amount of a ∼2.4-kilobase transcript can be seen in placenta. A smaller, ∼1.2-kilobase transcript was also detected at high levels in pancreas. This transcript may represent an alternatively spliced form of HAOX1 or may reflect the use of one of the multiple near-consensus polyadenylation sites upstream of the consensus polyadenylation motif in the HAOX1 cDNA. A ∼2.0-kilobase HAOX2 transcript was detected at high levels in both liver and kidney (middle panel). The finding of similarly sized transcripts of HAOX1 and HAOX2 in kidney raises the possibility of cross-reactivity of the HAOX1 probe with an HAOX2 transcript. This is unlikely, however, since the nucleotide sequence across the HAOX1 probe is only 56% identical to the corresponding HAOX2 sequence and highly stringent conditions were used in blotting. Small amounts of an HAOX2 transcript were also observed in thymus. HAOX3 appeared to be expressed only in pancreas (lower panel). These results are consistent with prior reports of 2-hydroxy acid oxidase activity in human liver and kidney (16.Angermuller S. Progr. Histochem. Cytochem. 1989; 20: 42-45Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 17.Fry D.W. Richardson K.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 568: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 22.Schuman M. Massey V.

Biochem. 1976; 63: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) but are novel in identifying the pancreas, placenta, and thymus as possible sites of 2-hydroxy acid oxidase expression. The high degree of amino acid sequence identity between HAOX1, HAOX2, HAOX3, and spinach GOX suggested that these proteins might have 2-hydroxy acid oxidase activity. To test this hypothesis, we transfected human skin fibroblasts with plasmids designed to express epitope-tagged versions of HAOX1, HAOX2, HAOX3, and a control plasmid. The three HAOX expression plasmids, pcDNA3-Nmyc/HAOX1, pcDNA3-Nmyc/HAOX2, and pcDNA3-Nmyc/HAOX3, each encode an 18-amino acid c-myc epitope tag immediately upstream of theHAOX open reading frames. Each of the four transfected cell populations were lysed, and the resulting lysates were tested for activity against a panel of 2-hydroxy acids. The lysate of cells expressing Nmyc/HAOX1 showed the highest activity with glycolate as substrate but also exhibited activity toward glyoxylate, 2-hydroxyoctanoate, and 2-hydroxypalmitate (Fig.6 A, upper panel). Nmyc/HAOX1 showed no activity with lactate, 2-hydroxybutyrate, or 3-methyl-2-hydroxybutyrate as substrate. In contrast, lysates of cells transfected with pcDNA3-Nmyc/HAOX2 showed activity only with 2-hydroxyoctanoate or 2-hydroxypalmitate as substrate (Fig.6 A, middle panel), indicating that this enzyme prefers longer chain 2-hydroxy acids. The lysate from cells expressing Nmyc/HAOX3 was only active on 2-hydroxyoctanoate (Fig.6 A, lower panel). Control lysates from human"

Type XI collagen plays a critical role in collagen fibril formation and skeletal morphogenesis. We investigated a tissue-specific transcriptional enhancer in the first intron of the α2(XI) collagen gene (Col11a2). Transient transfection assays using reporter gene constructs revealed that a 60-base pair (bp) segment within intron 1 increased promoter activity of Col11a2 in rat chondrosarcoma cells but not in either BalB/3T3 cells or undifferentiated ATDC5 cells, suggesting that it contained cell type-specific enhancer activity. In transgenic mice, this 60-bp fragment was also able to target β-galactosidase expression to cartilage including the limbs and axial skeleton, with similar localization specificity as the full-length intron 1 fragment. Competition experiments in gel shift assays using mutated oligonucleotides showed that recombinant Sox9 bound to a 7-bp sequence, CTCAAAG, within the 60-bp segment. Anti-Sox9 antibodies supershifted the complex of the 60-bp segment with recombinant Sox9 or with rat chondrosarcoma cell extracts, confirming the binding of Sox9 to the enhancer. Moreover, a site-specific mutation within the 7-bp segment resulted in essentially complete loss of the enhancer activity in chondrosarcoma cells and transgenic mice. These results suggest that the 7-bp sequence within intron 1 plays a critical role in the cartilage-specific enhancer activity of Col11a2 through Sox9-mediated transcriptional activation.

Cartilage contains unique extracellular matrix proteins produced by chondrocytes. The collagen network provides the scaffolding of the cartilage matrix and confers tensile strength important for resisting compression in cartilage. Collagen fibrils in cartilage consist of the major collagen, type II, and minor collagens, type IX and type XI. Type XI collagen, consisting of α1(XI), α2(XI), and α3(XI) chains, co-assembles with type II collagen to form cartilage collagen fibrils, whereas type IX collagen is associated with the surface of these fibrils (1.Mendler M.

It has also been shown that the promoter of Col11a2 contains Sox9-binding sites necessary for cartilage-specific expression (16.Bridgewater L.C. Lefebvre V. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14998-15006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar).In this study, we have characterized the activity of the intron enhancer of Col11a2 by deletion analysis in cell cultures and in transgenic mice and by DNA binding assays. We found that a 60-bp sequence from intron 1 can direct cartilage-specific expression ofCol11a2. Mutation analysis identified a 7-bp sequence within the sequence critical for cell type-specific enhancer activity and Sox9 interactions.DISCUSSIONType XI collagen is an essential structural component in cartilage. Regulation of Col11a2 is mediated by positive and negative regulatory elements. For example, Sox9 binding elements at ∼−600 and ∼−520 promotes cartilage-specific expression ofCol11a2 (16.Bridgewater L.C. Lefebvre V. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14998-15006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). A neural tissue-specific element (−454 to −500) and a cartilage-specific element (−501 to −530) that converts neuronal tissue-specific expression to cartilage have been identified (13.Tsumaki N. Kimura T. Tanaka K. Kimura J.H. Ochi T. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22861-22864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition to these promoter elements, the first intron segment enhanced the promoter activity in cartilage and was required for expression of Col11a2 in the notochord (13.Tsumaki N. Kimura T. Tanaka K. Kimura J.H. Ochi T. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22861-22864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this report, we have identified a sequence in the first intron required for cartilage-specific expression of Col11a2.We found that a 300-bp intron segment contained full enhancer activity similar to that of the 2.3-kb intron segment in transfection assays in RCS cells. Transfection analysis using oligonucleotides as competitors identified a 30-bp sequence within the 300-bp segment important for the enhancer activity. This oligonucleotide competition approach has advantages over a conventional method using mutated constructs. It is quick (i.e. no requirement for the creation of mutations in the constructs) and can compare enhancer activity using the same wild type reporter construct without sacrificing the size of the enhancer segment of interest. A disadvantage may be a limitation of the size of oligonucleotides to be used as competitors. Using this approach, we narrowed down an enhancer-containing sequence to 60 bp within the 300-bp segment. The 60-bp sequence enhanced the −453 promoter ofCol11a2 by 10-fold compared with 40-fold enhancement by the 300-bp or 2-kb intron segment. The reduced enhancer activity of the 60-bp sequence may occur because its flanking sequence might be important for stable factor-DNA binding and/or recognized by other factors for the full enhancer activity in a cooperative manner. Consistent with this hypothesis, amplifications of the 60-bp sequence increased enhancer activity (i.e. 2.7, 4.6, 11.5, and 16.0-fold increase by two, four, six, and eight copies, respectively; Table I). These results suggest that multiple factors may be required for the full enhancer activity.Gel shift assays showed that Sox9 protein bound a 7-bp sequence, CTCAAAG (+1334 to +1339), within the 60-bp segment. A substitution mutation in the 7-bp sequence showed little activity in RCS cells (Table I). These results suggest that the 7-bp sequence is critical for enhancer activity through Sox9 binding. When nuclear extracts from RCS cells were used in EMSAs with the 60-bp probe, two complexes were formed. The fast migrating band represents a Sox9-DNA complex because its migration position was similar to that of the complex with the Sox9 protein and the antibodies to Sox9 supershifted the complex. It is likely that the slower migrating band contains another protein factor(s) in addition to Sox9. It was reported that other Sox family proteins (e.g. Sox5 and Sox6) cooperatively work with Sox9 for activation of the enhancer of the Col2a1 gene (34.Lefebvre V. Li P. de Crombrugghe B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5718-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Our observations are in agreement with these observations. These results indicate that the 7-bp cis-acting element plays a central role in the chondrocyte-specific enhancer activity and strongly suggest that the Sox9 protein is a key mediator for the transcription ofCol11a2 in chondrocyte.The 60-bp sequence was able to direct expression of the −453 promoter of Col11a2 in the cartilage of transgenic mice. The expression patterns of the reporter β-galactosidase gene were similar to those with the construct containing either the 300-bp or the 2.3-kb intron segment (15.Tsumaki N. Kimura T. Matsui Y. Nakata K. Ochi T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). 2Y. Liu, H. Li, K. Tanaka, N. Tsumaki, and Y. Yamada, unpublished data. A 7-bp substitution mutation in the 60-bp sequence eliminated the enhancer activity, suggesting that this 7-bp sequence is critical for tissue-specific activity, which is in agreement with the transfection analysis. Interestingly, the 60-bp enhancer-containing construct failed to direct β-galactosidase expression in the notochord (data not shown). Because the 2.3-kb intron segment is necessary for notochord-specific expression of Col11a2, the 60-bp sequence likely lacks the information necessary for expression in the notochord. Thus, Co1l1a2 is positively regulated by at least two distinct elements, one for cartilage and another for notochord in the first intron.Col11a2 contains redundant Sox9 sites. Each site may have unique activity in different tissues, and such redundancy may be necessary for the optimum expression of Col11a2 to form collagen fibrils specific to each type of cartilage. Differences in the activity of these sites observed in transfected RCS cells may not be the only regulatory mechanisms of Col11a2 expression in cartilage. Recently, it was reported that sequences adjacent to the Sox9 site are also required for the chondrocyte-specific enhancer activity of Col2a1 and that new members of the Sox family,l-Sox5 and Sox6, form a heterodimer and activate theCol2a1 enhancer co-operatively with Sox9 (34.Lefebvre V. Li P. de Crombrugghe B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5718-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that protein factors, such as l-Sox5 and Sox6, may also be involved in Col11a2 expression. Levels of Sox9 and these proteins may differ in each cartilage and have preferential utilization of the multi-modular elements containing the Sox9 site forCol11a2 expression. Cartilage is a highly specialized tissue important for bearing compression loads in joints and also serves as the template for most developing bones. Cartilage contains unique extracellular matrix proteins produced by chondrocytes. The collagen network provides the scaffolding of the cartilage matrix and confers tensile strength important for resisting compression in cartilage. Collagen fibrils in cartilage consist of the major collagen, type II, and minor collagens, type IX and type XI. Type XI collagen, consisting of α1(XI), α2(XI), and α3(XI) chains, co-assembles with type II collagen to form cartilage collagen fibrils, whereas type IX collagen is associated with the surface of these fibrils (1.Mendler M.

Irwin M.I. Mayne R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 991-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The α1(XI) and α2(XI) chains are distinct gene products (3.Bernard M. Yoshioka H.

Biophys. 1983; 226: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that type IX and type XI collagens regulate the collagen network by determining the diameter of cartilage collagen fibrils and their interactions with other matrix components (6.Keene D.R.

Mutations in the type XI collagen genes have been identified and found to cause chondrodysplasia in both humans and mice. For example, mutations in the α2(XI) collagen gene (Col11a2) were identified in patients with Stickler syndrome and otospondylo-megaepiphyseal dysplasia (10.Vikkula M. Mariman E.C.M. Lui V.C.H. Zhidkova N.I. Tiller G.E. Goldring M.B. van Beersum S.E.C. de Waal Malefiit M.C. van den Hoogen F.H.J. Ropers H.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 431-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). A null mutation in the α1(XI) gene of cho (chondrodysplasia) mice causes dwarfism with reduced matrix and thickened cartilage collagen fibrils (11.Li Y. Lacerda D.A. Warman M.L. Beier D.R.

These findings indicate that type XI collagen plays an important role in skeletal morphogenesis and that expression of type XI collagen is critical for the development of cartilage. Several regulatory regions of the mouse α2(XI) collagen gene have been identified, and their modular arrangements have been proposed (12.Tsumaki N. Kimura T. J. Biol.

Inclusion of a 2.3-kb1segment from the first intron to the −742 promoter construct increased the promoter activity of Col11a2 (15.Tsumaki N. Kimura T. Matsui Y. Nakata K. Ochi T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A shorter promoter construct (−453) did not show cartilage-specific expression; however, inclusion of the intron sequence to the construct induced reporter gene expression in cartilage. These results suggest the presence of the enhancer in intron 1. More recently, it was found that the −530 promoter sequence was sufficient for cartilage-specific expression ofCol11a2 and that deletion of a sequence between −530 and −500 abolished reporter gene expression in cartilage, suggesting the presence of regulatory elements within this region required for cartilage-specific expression (13.Tsumaki N.

The HMG box region of SOX9 binds DNA at the target sequences AACAT and AACAAAG (22.Harley V.R. Jackson D.I. Hextall P.J. Hawkins J.R. Berkovitz G.D. Sockanathan S. Lovell-Badge R. Goodfellow P.N.

It has also been shown that the promoter of Col11a2 contains Sox9-binding sites necessary for cartilage-specific expression (16.Bridgewater L.C. Lefebvre V. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol.

A 7-bp substitution mutation in the 60-bp sequence eliminated the enhancer activity, suggesting that this 7-bp sequence is critical for tissue-specific activity, which is in agreement with the transfection analysis. Interestingly, the 60-bp enhancer-containing construct failed to direct β-galactosidase expression in the notochord (data not shown). Because the 2.3-kb intron segment is necessary for notochord-specific expression of Col11a2, the 60-bp sequence likely lacks the information necessary for expression in the notochord. Thus, Co1l1a2 is positively regulated by at least two distinct elements, one for cartilage and another for notochord in the first intron. Col11a2 contains redundant Sox9 sites. Each site may have unique activity in different tissues, and such redundancy may be necessary for the optimum expression of Col11a2 to form collagen fibrils specific to each type of cartilage. Differences in the activity of these sites observed in transfected RCS cells may not be the only regulatory mechanisms of Col11a2 expression in cartilage. Recently, it was reported that sequences adjacent to the Sox9 site are also required for the chondrocyte-specific enhancer activity of Col2a1 and that new members of the Sox family,l-Sox5 and Sox6, form a heterodimer and activate theCol2a1 enhancer co-operatively with Sox9 (34.Lefebvre V. Li P. de Crombrugghe B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5718-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that protein factors, such as l-Sox5 and Sox6, may also be involved in Col11a2 expression. Levels of Sox9 and these proteins may differ in each cartilage and have preferential utilization of the multi-modular elements containing the Sox9 site forCol11a2 expression. We thank H.

To investigate the molecular target for “superinduction,” we analyzed the agonist-induced degradation of AhR. Whereas 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a potent agonist of AhR, induces a rapid reduction of the AhR protein, cycloheximide blocks the down-regulation of steady state AhR. Analyses of the turnover of AhR reveal that cycloheximide blocks the shortening of the half-life of AhR by TCDD. Blocking of the TCDD-induced AhR degradation requires inhibition of protein synthesis, because (a) cycloheximide inhibits protein synthesis at the concentration at which it causes superinduction and inhibition of AhR degradation; and (b) puromycin, an inhibitor of protein synthesis by mimicking aminoacyl-tRNA, also blocks the TCDD-induced AhR degradation. The blocking of the TCDD-induced AhR degradation correlates with the superinduction of CYP1A1 gene expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, cycloheximide is shown to increase the accumulation of the TCDD-activated AhR and the functional AhR·Arnt complex in nucleus. Collectively, our results reveal a mechanism of superinduction by cycloheximide by enhancing the stability of agonist-activated AhR. The finding that inhibition of protein synthesis blocks the TCDD-induced AhR turnover implicates a cycloheximide-sensitive, labile factor (designated as AhR degradationpromoting factor, or ADPF) in controlling the removal of agonist-activated AhR in nucleus.

Because of the broad range and the complexity of the biological responses that AhR contributes to, it is conceivable that the signal transduction of AhR involves a complex process during which AhR is regulated through different cellular mechanisms in a tissue-, species-, and developmental stage-dependent manner. The TCDD-inducible CYP1A1 gene encodes cytochrome P4501A1, a major inducible form of microsomal P450 in mammalian species; P4501A1 oxygenates polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as the carcinogen benzo(a)pyrine (23.Conney A.H. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 4875-4917PubMed Google Scholar), as the initial step in the metabolism of the chemicals to water soluble metabolites for excretion from body. Studies on the induction of CYP1A1 gene expression by TCDD provided major mechanistic understanding of the mechanism of action and regulation of AhR (2.Whitlock Jr., J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 103-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, 3.Hankinson O. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 307-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar). In uninduced cells, AhR is localized in the cytoplasm, complexed with hsp90 (24.Perdew G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13802-13805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and AIP, an immunophillin-type chaperon protein (25.Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 18: 978-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Binding with an agonist triggers the dissociation of AhR from the associated proteins and translocation into nucleus, where AhR dimerizes with Arnt, another bHLH/PAS transcription factor (28.Hoffman E.C. Reyes H. Chu F. Sander F. Conley L.H. Brooks B.A. Hankinson O. Science. 1991; 252: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). The AhR/Arnt dimer binds to a specific nucleotide sequence termed DRE (dioxin responsive element) in the enhancer region of theCYP1A1 gene (29.Denison M.S. Fisher J.M. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2528-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar); the transcription activation domains of AhR are essential for the subsequent transcriptional events, including alterations in chromatin structure, binding of general transcription factors to the promoter, and induction of transcription of the gene (30.Ma Q.

Several cellular mechanisms have been recognized for the regulation of the AhR activity during the induction of CYP1A1. For example, cycloheximide enhances the induction of CYP1A1 gene expression by TCDD, a phenomenon termed “superinduction.” Early studies established that the superinduction involves an increase in the rate of transcription of the gene, requires functional DREs, but does not change several measurable properties of the TCDD-receptor complex such as the sedimentation velocity of the complex (33.Israel D.I. Estolano M.G. Galeazzi D.R. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5648-5653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Lusska A. Wu L. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15146-15151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since cycloheximide is known to inhibit protein synthesis, it is assumed that a labile, inhibitory protein factor regulates the AhR activity. However, the nature and the mechanism of action of the putative “labile” factor remain unknown. In another scenario, treatment with TCDD shortens the half-life of the AhR protein from 28 to 3 h (35.Ma Q. Baldwin K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8432-8438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The TCDD-induced turnover of AhR is mediated through the 26 S proteasome, involves ubiquitination of AhR, and requires the transcription activation domain of AhR (35.Ma Q. Baldwin K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8432-8438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Moreover, inhibition of the 26 S proteasome by proteasome inhibitors increases the induction ofCYP1A1 by TCDD; these findings implicate the agonist-induced AhR degradation in the regulation of AhR function. To identify the molecular target of cycloheximide, we analyzed the TCDD-induced AhR turnover in the superinduction. We show here that cycloheximide blocks TCDD-induced degradation of AhR. Inhibition of the TCDD-induced AhR degradation requires inhibition of protein synthesis and correlates with the superinduction in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, cycloheximide is shown to increase the accumulation of the AhR and the functional AhR·Arnt complex in nucleus. In addition, we show that inhibition of the 26 S proteasome superinduces CYP1A1 expression in a similar fashion to cycloheximide. To our knowledge, this report is the first study demonstrating that cycloheximide blocks the agonist-induced degradation of the AhR protein. Our findings provide a novel mechanism of superinduction of CYP1A1 in which a cycloheximide-sensitive, labile protein factor (designated asAhR degradation promotingfactor, or ADPF) negatively regulates the stability of agonist-activated, nuclear AhR. AmpliTaq polymerase was from Perkin-Elmer (Foster City, CA). Restriction endonucleases and other DNA-modifying enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Radioactive compounds were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Piscataway, NJ). Cell culture materials were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY). Cycloheximide (CHX), puromycin, dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), aprotinin, leupeptin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were from Sigma. Lactacycstin and MG132 were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. (San Diego, CA). TCDD was purchased from AccuStandard (New Haven, CT). Reagents for immunoblotting and Northern blotting are as described below. The mouse hepa1c1c7 cells were gifts from Dr. J. P. Whitlock, Jr. (Stanford University). The cells were grown as monolayer in α-minimal essential medium, containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% CO2 at 37 °C, as described previously (36.Miller A.G. Israel D.I. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3523-3527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were treated with TCDD or other agents as described in figure legends; Me2SO was used as the solvent control for TCDD. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to published procedures (29.Denison M.S. Fisher J.M. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2528-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Briefly, wild type hepa1c1c7 cells, after treatment, were washed in a hypotonic buffer and homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer; the nuclei were obtained by differential centrifugation; nuclear extracts were prepared by incubation of the nuclei with a high salt buffer, followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × gfor 1 h. For preparation of total cell lysate, cells were grown to near confluency in a 60-mm dish, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and scraped into 300 μl of a reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). The cells were disrupted by brief sonication; total cell lysate was obtained by centrifugation at 13,000 × gfor 10 min in a refrigerated microcentrifuge. EMSA was carried out using nuclear extract from hepa1c1c7 cells, as described previously (29.Denison M.S. Fisher J.M. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2528-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), except that 6% polyacrylamide gels were used. The DNA probe contains the DNA recognition sequence for the AhR/Arnt heteromer designated as DRE D (37.Lusska A. Shen E. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6575-6580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The probe was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). The nuclear extracts were incubated with poly(dI-dC) for 15 min at room temperature. The 32P-labeled probe was then added and incubated for another 15 min at room temperature, followed by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis; the AhR·Arnt·DRE complexes were visualized by autoradiography. For immunoblotting, total cell lysate or nuclear extract of 5 μg was fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes according to established procedures (38.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The blots were blocked with 5% dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h with shaking. Blots were then incubated with a polyclonal antibody against AhR (25.Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8878-8884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) for 1 h, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for an additional 1 h. Signals were visualized by chemiluminescence using an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To ensure equal loading of the samples, the same blots were reprobed with a monoclonal anti-mouse actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), followed by incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Promega) and color visualization with the nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate system (Promega). For quantitation of the blotting results, the visualized results were scanned and analyzed by using the ImageQuaNT (version 4.2) program (Molecular Dynamics, San Jose, CA). All data were corrected for loading variations by comparing the amount of actin of each sample analyzed. For Northern blotting of CYP1A1, a cDNA fragment (∼700 base pairs) encoding the 5′-untranslated region of the mouse CYP1A1 messenger RNA was used to generate a riboprobe for CYP1A1. To prepare an actin probe, a cDNA fragment of mouse actin was generated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction with primers specific for mouse actin (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), subcloned into pCRII (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and used as a template for riboprobe synthesis. Riboprobes were synthesized in the presence of DIG-UTP using a DIG RNA-labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IL). Total RNA was isolated from cells using a Qiagen total RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA samples of 5 μg each were electrophoresed in a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to a Nytran membrane. After cross-linking, the membranes were hybridized with the DIG-labeled riboprobes at 68 °C overnight; signals were visualized by chemiluminescence using a DIG RNA detection kit with CDP star as a substrate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For all samples analyzed, parallel blots were assayed at the same time for bothCYP1A1 and actin mRNAs. Quantitation of the blotting results were performed by using the ImageQuaNT program as described above. All data were corrected for loading variations by comparing the amount of actin of each sample analyzed. Cells grown to near confluence were incubated in methionine-free medium with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 1 h and incubated for another hour in fresh methionine-free medium with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum plus [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cells were then incubated in α-minimal essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and treated with Me2SO, cycloheximide (10 μg/ml), TCDD (1 nm), or TCDD plus cycloheximide for various time periods. The cells were scraped into RIPA buffer (1% Ipegal CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin in phosphate-buffered saline). The35S-labled AhR was precipitated with the anti-AhR antibodies, fractionated by SDS-PAGE (10%), and visualized by fluorography. AhR was precipitated with anti-AhR antibodies according to a standard method (39.Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown in 6-well plates were scraped into RIPA buffer. Cell extracts were prepared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min, followed by preclearing by incubation with normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and protein A-agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 30 min at 4 °C. The extracts were then incubated with the anti-AhR antibodies (20.Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2144-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 40.Dong L. Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7942-7948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) for 1 h and with protein A-agarose for an additional hour. The precipitated agarose beads were washed 3 times with the RIPA buffer and resuspended in a loading buffer for analysis by SDS-PAGE. Immunofluorescent staining of cells with anti-AhR IgG was performed according to standard procedures (39.Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown on coverslips were washed with 1 × phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min, and permeabilized with methanol at −20 °C for 6 min. The cells were then blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min with shaking, and blotted with an affinity-purified polyclonal anti-mouse AhR IgG (Biomol, Plymouth Meetings, PA) in 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, followed by incubation with a fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA) for an additional 1 h in the dark. The glass coverslips were mounted onto slides with Prolong (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), an anti-fade mounting medium. Fluorescence was visualized using a Sarastro 2000 laser scanning confocal microscope fitted with an argon-ion laser (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) and an Optiphot-2 microscope (Nikon, Inc., Melville, PA). Confocal images were recorded through a ×60 lens objective using a 488-nm laser line. Cycloheximide superinduces the transcriptional gene expression of CYP1A1 in the presence of an agonist of AhR. As shown in Fig. 1 A, cycloheximide alone does not affect CYP1A1 gene expression (lane 3), whereas co-treatment of hepa1c1c7 cells with TCDD (1 nm) and cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) for 5 h increases the induction of CYP1A1 by TCDD by 6-fold (comparelanes 2 and 4). These results indicate that the superinduction requires activation of AhR by an agonist, suggesting that AhR or a component of the AhR signaling pathway serves as a primary target of cycloheximide. In a recent study on the turnover of the AhR protein, we showed that TCDD shortens the half-life of AhR from 28 to 3 h through ubiquitin-proteasome mediated proteolysis (35.Ma Q. Baldwin K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8432-8438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition of the 26 S proteasome by using proteasome inhibitors enhances the induction of CYP1A1 by TCDD. These findings raised the question of whether cycloheximide modulates the agonist-induced degradation of AhR as a mechanism of superinduction. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of cycloheximide on the protein level of AhR during the superinduction by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 1,B and C, treatment of the cells with TCDD (1 nm, 4 h) down-regulates the steady state AhR to less than 20% of the control. Cycloheximide alone (10 μg/ml) does not affect the protein level of AhR (lane 2). However, the level of the AhR protein in cells treated with TCDD plus cycloheximide (TCDD, 1 nm; CHX, 10 μg/ml; 4 h) is nearly the same as the controls (compare lane 4 with 1 and2). Thus, cycloheximide completely blocks the reduction of the steady state AhR protein by TCDD. Since TCDD down-regulates the AhR protein by increasing its turnover, we next tested if cycloheximide inhibits the TCDD-induced degradation of AhR by measuring the half-life (t 12) of AhR. Pulse-chase labeling experiments reveal that AhR in Me2SO-treated cells is relatively stable with at 12 of 28 h (Fig.2, A and B, Ref.35.Ma Q. Baldwin K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8432-8438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar); cycloheximide alone does not affect the t 12 of AhR. TCDD shortens the t 12 of AhR to ∼3 h. However, the t 12 value of AhR in cells treated with TCDD plus cycloheximide is comparable with that in Me2SO-treated cells (i.e. ∼28 h). Therefore, cycloheximide fully inhibits the TCDD-induced turnover of the AhR protein. Cycloheximide inhibits protein synthesis by blocking the peptidyl synthetase activity of eukaryotic ribosomes. To explore the mechanism of inhibition of TCDD-induced AhR degradation by cycloheximide, we analyzed the role of protein synthesis in AhR degradation. IκBα, a regulatory subunit of the NFκB transcription factor, is known to undergo a rapid, signal-induced degradation during the activation of NFκB, followed by recovery of the protein through protein synthesis (41.Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first used the signal-induced degradation and synthesis of IkBα as a control to test if cycloheximide inhibits protein synthesis under the experimental condition for superinduction. As shown in Fig.3, treatment with LPS (5 μg/ml), an activator of NFκB, results in a rapid reduction of IκBα (lanes 1–5); the reduction is followed by recovery of the protein level through protein synthesis (lane 6). However, co-treatment with LPS and CHX (10 μg/ml) blocks the recovery of IκBα (compare lane 12 with lane 6). These results reveal that cycloheximide inhibits the synthesis of labile proteins, such as IκBα, at a concentration at which it superinducesCYP1A1 and inhibits the TCDD induced AhR degradation. Others have reported inhibition of total protein synthesis by cycloheximide at a similar concentration (34.Lusska A. Wu L. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15146-15151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings implicate inhibition of protein synthesis in the action of cycloheximide on AhR degradation. These results also imply that inhibition of protein degradation by cycloheximide exhibits certain specificity toward target proteins, because cycloheximide does not inhibit the LPS-induced degradation of IκBα. We next examined if inhibition of protein synthesis is sufficient for blocking of AhR degradation. Puromycin, an analog of aminoacyl-tRNA, inhibits protein synthesis and superinduces CYP1A1 with a similar potency to cycloheximide (33.Israel D.I. Estolano M.G. Galeazzi D.R. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5648-5653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested if puromycin blocks AhR degradation by TCDD. As shown in Fig.4, while puromycin alone does not affect the AhR protein level, co-treatment of cells with TCDD and puromycin fully inhibits the degradation of AhR by TCDD. Since puromycin inhibits protein synthesis through a different mechanism from that of cycloheximide, these results indicate that inhibition of protein synthesis is sufficient for inhibition of TCDD-induced AhR turnover. Together, these data support the mechanism of inhibition of AhR degradation through inhibition of protein synthesis. These results implicate a cycloheximide-sensitive, labile, or inducible factor in promoting the TCDD-induced degradation of AhR; hence, we designated the factor as ADPF. Cloning of ADPF will provide new insights into the interplay between inhibition of protein synthesis and inhibition of protein degradation. The finding that cycloheximide blocks TCDD-induced AhR degradation at the concentration of superinduction suggests a mechanism of superinduction by which cycloheximide enhances the stability of agonist-activated AhR through inhibition of AhR degradation. To test this notion, we examined the time and dose curves of the inhibition of AhR degradation and the superinduction of CYP1A1 by cycloheximide. Treatment of cells with TCDD causes a time-dependent reduction of the level of the AhR protein (Fig. 5,A and B, lanes 6–10), which approaches the maximum reduction at 5 h. Cycloheximide blocks the TCDD-induced reduction (lanes 11–15) and increases the AhR protein to levels comparable to those treated with cycloheximide alone (lanes 1–5). Analyses of the induction of CYP1A1under similar conditions reveal that TCDD induces CYP1A1time dependently with the maximum induction at 5 h. Cycloheximide enhances the maximal induction (Fig. 5, C and D, compare lanes 9 and 10 with lanes 13–15). Furthermore, cycloheximide treatment shortens the time to reach the maximal induction (i.e. 2.5 h), indicating that inhibition of AhR degradation at early time points markedly increases the rate of the induction.

SCAMPs contain multiple N-terminal NPF repeats and four highly conserved transmembrane regions. NPF repeats often interact with EH domain proteins that function in budding of transport vesicles from the plasma membrane or the Golgi complex. We now show that the NPF repeats of SCAMP1 bind to two EH domain proteins, intersectin 1, which is involved in endocytic budding at the plasma membrane, and γ-synergin, which may mediate the budding of vesicles in the trans-Golgi complex. Expression of SCAMP1 lacking the N-terminal NPF repeats potently inhibited transferrin uptake by endocytosis. Our data suggest that one of the functions of SCAMPs is to participate in endocytosis via a mechanism which may involve the recruitment of clathrin coats to the plasma membrane and the trans-Golgi network.

At least three SCAMPs are expressed in vertebrates, and all cells tested express at least one SCAMP isoform (5.Singleton D.R. Wu T.T. Castle J.D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2099-2107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2R. Fernández-Chacón and T. C. Sudhof, unpublished observation. All SCAMPs are composed of four transmembrane regions with cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal regions. The function of SCAMPs is unknown. SCAMPs 1 and 3 are tyrosine-phosphorylated by the epidermal growth factor-receptor, suggesting that they are subject to regulation by phosphorylation (6.Wu T.T. Castle J.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1661-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A knockout of SCAMP1, the most abundant SCAMP isoform, failed to display a major phenotype and exhibited only a moderate defect in membrane traffic in mast cells as analyzed by capacitance recordings (7.Fernández-Chacón R. Alvarez de Toledo G. Hammer R.E. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32551-32554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This defect could have been due to a change in the rate constants of either exocytosis, endocytosis, or both. The knockout indicates a function for SCAMPs in membrane traffic, with the mildness of the phenotype probably due to redundancy with the other SCAMP isoforms that appear to be co-expressed in most cells with SCAMP1. Sequence analyses revealed that SCAMPs contain multiple NPF (asparagine-proline-phenylalanine) repeats in the cytoplasmic N terminus. NPF represents a binding motif for EH domains (8.De Beer T.

The presence of NPF repeats in the N terminus of SCAMPs suggests a potential role in binding to cytosolic EH domain proteins, possibly during endocytosis. Although several NPF ligands for EH domain proteins have been described, all of them are soluble cytosolic proteins. A role for transmembrane proteins, such as SCAMPs, as docking sites for cytosolic EH domain proteins is of potential significance because it would provide an intramembranous docking site for protein complexes in endocytosis. One of the major problems in understanding vesicular budding during endocytosis is how the endocytic clathrin coat is assembled on the membrane. It seems likely that specific binding sites for the adaptor protein complex AP-2 nucleate assembly of the clathrin coat on the plasma membrane (20.Mahaffey D.T. Peeler J.S. Brodsky F.M. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16514-16520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Peeler J.S. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G.W. J.

Assembly of clathrin coats on intracellular membranes, e.g.the trans-Golgi apparatus, likely also involve recruitment of the appropriate adaptor complexes, such as AP-1, to the site of budding (23.Seaman M.N.J. Sowerby P.J. Robinson M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25446-25451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The only currently available candidates for a nucleation site for endocytosis are synaptotagmins which bind to AP-2 with high affinity (24.Zhang J.Z. Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 751-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 25.Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang Z.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). However, synaptotagmins are primarily expressed in neurons, with extremely low levels of some isoforms outside of the brain. This makes it unlikely that synaptotagmins represent universal AP-2 assembly sites that are present in all eukaryotic cells. In the current study, we have pursued the hypothesis that SCAMPs are intrinsic membrane proteins of recycling vesicles which serve as assembly sites for clathrin coats on the plasma membrane and Golgi apparatus. Vectors encoding the inserts (from rat) were constructed using polymerase chain reaction or standard subcloning techniques: pGEX-SCAMP1 = residues Met1–Leu151 in theXbaI-HindIII sites of pGEX-KG; pCMVSCAMP1 = full-length SCAMP1 in the EcoRI site of pCMV5; pCMVSCAMP1ΔNPF = Met53–Met338 in theXbaI site of pCMV5; pCMVSCAMP1-NT = Met1–Leu151 in theEcoRI/HindIII sites of pCMV5; pLexN-SCAMP1 = Met1–Leu151 into the SmaI site of pLexN; pLexN-SCAMP1ΔNPF = Arg44—Val149of SCAMP1 in the EcoRI/BamHI sites of pLexN; pVP16-EPS15 = Gln6–Gln317 of Eps15 in theBamHI/NotI sites of pVP16; pVP16-EPS15-EH1 = Gln6–Ala123 of Eps15 in theBamHI/NotI sites of pVP16; pVP16-EPS15-EH1,2 = Gln6–Leu262 of Eps15 in theBamHI/XbaI sites of pVP16–3; pMalC2-synergin = Val263–Ser447 of γ-synergin. pVP16-EHSH1 (full-length EHSH1/intersectin 1) and pVP16–3EHSH1–5 (truncated intersectin 1 without EH domains) were described previously (17.Okamoto M. Schoch S. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18446-18454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). All vectors were confirmed by DNA sequencing.

Four of these clones represented two independent isolates of γ-synergin (28.Page L.J. Sowerby P.J. Lui W.W. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 993-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), two corresponded to BAT3, which is a large proline-rich protein of unknown function whose gene is located in the class III region of the human major histocompatibility complex (29.Banerji J. Sands J. Strominger J.L. Spies T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2374-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and the remaining clones were likely artifacts because they were transcription factors or proteins frequently isolated in our yeast two-hybrid screens independent of the bait. The two γ-synergin prey clones encoded residues Ala55–Gly512 and Gly105–Ser465 of full-length γ-synergin, which extends 57 amino acids more N-terminally than the published sequence. Quantitative liquid β-galactosidase assays to estimate the strengths of yeast two-hybrid interactions were performed as described previously (26.Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A.

Neurosci. 1996; 15: 2488-2494Crossref Google Scholar) with yeast L40 cells grown for 48 h in 5 ml of -UTL medium lacking uridine, tryptophan, and leucine. All measurements were performed in triplicates, normalized to the amount of protein determined in the same samples, and calculated as nanomoles ofo-nitrophenol/min and milligrams of protein. Rat brains were homogenized in 10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 g/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and other protease inhibitors (leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin), extracted for 1 h at 4 °C after addition of an equal volume of 10 mmHEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 g/liter PMSF, protease inhibitors, 0.2 m NaCl, 2% Triton X-100, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. For SCAMP1 batch affinity chromatography experiments, 0.1 ml of glutathione-agarose beads containing ∼0.4 mg of GST-SCAMP1 or GST alone were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10.5 ml of total brain extract in buffer A (10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 g/liter PMSF, protease inhibitors, 0.1 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100). The glutathione-agarose was recovered by centrifugation, washed three times with 5 ml of buffer A, resuspended in 0.4 ml of sample buffer, and 20 μl of the eluted material was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblots. MBP-Synergin affinity chromatography experiments were peformed in a similar manner but incubation was done in 1.5 ml and washed four times with 1.5 ml of buffer A. COS cells were transfected with ∼1 μg of DNA of the indicated constructs using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) on day 1, transferred to coverslips on day 2, and endocytosis was assayed on day 3. Cells were starved in serum-free medium for 30–60 min, incubated with 20 μg/ml of fluorescein isothiocyanate-transferrin for 15 min, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 25 min at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized by immersion in −20 °C acetone for 5 min, and stained with anti-SCAMP1 polyclonal antibodies (dilution = 1:600). Images were acquired using a confocal microscope (Bio-Rad MRC1000 with an Axiovert 100 Zeiss microscope). Endocytosis was scored as the percentage of cells competent to internalize labeled transferrin, which was distributed in a punctate pattern after uptake (30.Achiriloaie M. Barylko B. Albanesi J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1410-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Cell were considered endocytosis-incompetent if they lacked fluorescent puncta. All transfections and analyses were performed by experimenters who did not know the nature of the plasmids used for a particular transfection. γ-Synergin cDNA cloning was performed by screennig a rat brain cDNA library by standard procedures (17.Okamoto M. Schoch S. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18446-18454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting were performed according to standard procedures (31.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar,32.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti α-adaptin antibodies were obtained from Sigma; polyclonal anti-amphiphysin 1 antibodies were a gift from Synaptic Systems (Göttingen, Germany). Antibodies to SCAMP1 were described previously (7.Fernández-Chacón R. Alvarez de Toledo G. Hammer R.E. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32551-32554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For RNA blots, a rat multitissue RNA blot (CLONTECH) was probed with uniformly [α-32P]dCTP labeled 1.2-kilobase pair SalI cDNA fragment from the γ-synergin prey clone. Prehybridizations and hybridization were performed at 42 °C overnight in 50% formamide plus Denhardt's solution 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Filters were washed twice for 30 min at 65 °C in 0.2 × SSC and 0.5% SDS and exposed for 1–5 days. All figures and illustrations were produced in Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. We used data bank searches to study the evolutionary conservation and domain structure of SCAMPs. Highly conserved SCAMP sequences were detected in plants (Arabidopsis thaliana), nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans), and insects (Drosophila melanogaster) in addition to vertebrates (data not shown). Sequence alignments demonstrated that all available full-length SCAMP structures contain multiple NPF repeats and a proline-rich sequence in the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain that precedes the four transmembrane regions. The presence of NPF repeats in SCAMPs was intriguing because NPF repeats represent binding sites for EH domains, autonomously folding protein modules that are primarily observed in proteins involved in endocytosis (8.De Beer T. Carter R.E. Lobel-Rice K.E. Sorkin A. Overduin M. Science. 1998; 281: 1357-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 9.Paoluzi S. Castagnoli L. Lauro I. Salcini A.E. Coda L. Fre S. Confalonieri S. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Cesareni G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6541-6550Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Since SCAMPs appear to be universal membrane components of recycling vesicles in all cells tested (2.Brand S.H. Laurie S.M. Mixon M.B. Castle J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18949-18957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Singleton D.R. Wu T.T. Castle J.D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2099-2107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), their interaction with cytosolic adaptor proteins in endocytosis could provide a mechanism to initiate the assembly of clathrin coats for endocytic budding. To test this idea, and to identify potential EH domain proteins which bind to SCAMP, we screened a rat brain cDNA library by yeast two-hybrid selection for interacting proteins with the N-terminal sequences of SCAMP1. Sequencing of the prey clones obtained in the yeast two-hybrid screen showed that γ-synergin was the major protein isolated. Two independent clones for γ-synergin were selected multiple times. γ-Synergin is a recently described cytoplasmic protein that contains a central EH domain (28.Page L.J. Sowerby P.J. Lui W.W. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 993-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), suggesting that the EH domain could bind to the NPF repeats of SCAMP1. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the two γ-synergin clones isolated in the yeast two-hybrid screens overlap in the EH domain. The C terminus of γ-synergin binds to α-adaptin, a component of the Golgi clathrin adaptor protein complex AP-1, but the γ-synergin C terminus was not present in the yeast two-hybrid prey clones. To characterize γ-synergin further, we isolated from a rat brain cDNA library multiple independent cDNA clones that covered the N-terminal two-thirds of the protein (data not shown). Sequencing of these clones confirmed the previously described structure of γ-synergin except that at the N terminus, the rat γ-synergin cDNA had an open reading frame that extends 57 residues beyond the reported N terminus of human γ-synergin (28.Page L.J. Sowerby P.J. Lui W.W. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 993-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), suggesting that the N terminus of γ-synergin is longer than previously thought. In addition, sequence analyses revealed multiple internal repeats in the C-terminal half of γ-synergin, indicating that γ-synergin is composed of distinct domains (data not shown). RNA blots showed that γ-synergin is expressed in all tissues tested, with at least some tissues synthesizing multiple species of mRNA which appears to be a relatively abundant (data not shown). The yeast two-hybrid results suggested that the N-terminal NPF repeats of SCAMP1 might bind to the EH domain of γ-synergin. To confirm this hypothesis, we further characterized the interaction of the two different γ-synergin prey clones with the N-terminal region of SCAMP1. Two yeast two-hybrid assays were used, transactivation of histidine auxotrophy (Fig.1 A) or quantitation of β-galactosidase (Fig. 1 B). Either the complete N-terminal sequence of SCAMP1 with the NPF repeats or a truncated sequence lacking the NPF repeats were tested. With both assays, SCAMP1 only interacted with γ-synergin when the NPF repeats were present, providing further evidence that the N-terminal NPF repeats bind to the EH domain of γ-synergin. We next asked how specific the binding of γ-synergin to SCAMPs is and if all EH domains or only a subset of EH domains bind to the NPF repeats of SCAMP1. GenBankTM searches revealed that the EH domain of γ-synergin is most closely related to the two EH domains of intersectin 1, whereas the classical EH domain protein EPS15 is less homologous (data not shown). Therefore we tested in the same yeast two-hybrid assays described above if the EH domains of intersectin 1 and Eps15 interact with SCAMP1 (Fig. 1). Again, a highly specific interaction of SCAMP1 with intersectin was observed. The SCAMP1/intersectin interaction depended on the presence of NPF repeats in SCAMP1 and of the EH domains in intersectin as would be expected for an EH domain-mediated binding reaction. In contrast to intersectin, Eps15 constructs containing one or two EH domains were inactive in both interaction assays. The Eps15 construct containing all three EH domains was borderline positive in the histidine auxotrophy assay but inactive in the β-galactosidase assay, suggesting a very weak interaction (Fig. 1). These data show that the NPF repeats of SCAMP1 specifically bind to a subset of EH domains, including those of γ-synergin and intersectin 1. To confirm the yeast two-hybrids results with an independent protein-based assay, we performed pulldown experiments with rat brain proteins. First we used a MBP fusion with the EH domain of γ-synergin to affinity purify rat brain proteins (Fig. 2 A). Immunoblotting revealed that SCAMP1 was bound only to the MBP-synergin fusion protein but not to MBP alone, suggesting that the EH domain of γ-synergin can capture SCAMP1 from the brain extract. Next we used a fusion protein of GST with the N-terminal domain of SCAMP1 in similar pulldown experiments, with GST alone as a control. Immunoblotting revealed that intersectin is highly enriched in the bound protein fraction; in fact, it was the most enriched protein (Fig.2 B). Because we did not have an antibody to γ-synergin, we could not test its binding in these experiments. However, immunoblotting also showed that α-adaptin of the AP-2 adaptor complex was enriched in the pellet. We currently do not know if AP-2 binds directly to a sequence in SCAMP1 or if it binds indirectly via intersectin. Furthermore, SNAP-25 (which we previously showed binds to intersectin (17.Okamoto M. Schoch S. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18446-18454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar)) was also specifically present in the bound proteins. Two controls indicate that these observations reflect specific binding reactions. First, GST alone was unable to capture either intersectin 1, AP-2, or SNAP-25 (lane 4, Fig. 2 B). Second, synapsins and amphiphysin, which are relatively abundant and sticky proline-rich proteins, were not bound to GST-SCAMP1 (Fig.2 B). Because SCAMPs are universally present in all cells tested, their binding to EH domain proteins could mediate the membrane recruitment of clathrin coats for budding, as occurs for example during receptor-mediated endocytosis. To test directly if SCAMP1 is involved in endocytosis, we transfected full-length SCAMP1, SCAMP1 with a deletion of the N-terminal NPF repeats, and the N-terminal NPF repeats of SCAMP1 without transmembrane regions into COS cells. Transfected cells were then incubated with fluorescently labeled transferrin, fixed, and stained for SCAMP1 to identify transfected cells. An observer who was blind to the nature of the transfected proteins quantitated the transfection results by scoring the percentage of cells that had taken up transferrin by endocytosis (Fig. 3). COS cells transfected with full-length SCAMP1 display strong labeling of recycling vesicle compartments with SCAMP1 antibodies (cell examples identified by asterisks in panels A–C of Fig.3); labeling is absent from adjacent nontransfected cells (example identified by a diamond). Endocytic transferrin uptake is normal in most nontransfected cells (Fig. 3 B; 92.0 ± 0.7% of untransfected cells contain endocytosed transferrin (mean ± S.E)). By contrast, cells expressing full-length SCAMP1 exhibit a partial block of endocytosis (53.7 ± 2.3% of transfected cells contain endocytosed transferrin (mean ± S.E); seediamonds in panels A–C). In cells expressing an N-terminally truncated form of SCAMP1 lacking the NPF repeats (SCAMP1Δ-NPF, exemplary cells identified by asterisks inpanels D–F of Fig. 3), endocytic transferrin uptake is almost completely inhibited (15.2 ± 2.1% of transfected cells contain endocytosed transferrin (mean ± S.E.)). Again, adjacent control cells are normal. In cells expressing only the N-terminal SCAMP1 fragment containing the NPF repeats (SCAMP1 N-terminal), the SCAMP1 fragment is diffusely localized throughout the cytoplasm (panels G–I), and no effect of the overexpression of the fragment on endocytosis is observed (89.0 ± 5.2% of transfected cells contain endocytosed transferrin (mean ± S.E.)). Clathrin coats are assembled on plasma membranes, membranes of the trans-Golgi network, and other intracellular membranes in preparation to budding of transport vesicles from these membranes. Clathrin coats are assembled in all cells, at all times, in a highly regulated and localized manner. One of the unsolved questions surrounding the assembly of clathrin coats, for example during endocytosis, is how clathrin-coat assembly is nucleated. Biochemical studies showed that a proteinaceous receptor on the plasma membrane may be involved in recruiting clathrin coats to specific plasma membrane domains that are destined to become endocytic vesicles (20.Mahaffey D.T. Peeler J.S. Brodsky F.M. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16514-16520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Seaman M.N. Ball C.L. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1093-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Since the receptor is endocytosed together with the clathrin coats, it is presumably a component of recycling vesicles. An alternative hypothesis is that the nucleation point is provided by the localized synthesis of certain lipids, such as phosphatidylinositol phosphates (see for example Refs.33.Jost M. Simpson F. Kavran J.M. Lemmon M.A. Schmid S.L. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1399-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 34.Kobayashi T. Gu F. Gruenberg J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive but could potentially explain different characteristics of the clathrin assembly process. The proteinaceous receptor would provide a co-localization of the coat with the proteins of recycling vesicles, whereas lipid synthesis could explain the regulated assembly of the coat. It has been suggested that synaptotagmin serves as an AP-2 recepor in endocytosis because it binds AP-2 with very high affinity (24.Zhang J.Z. Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 751-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 25.Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang Z.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Indeed, based on a number of experiments it seems likely that synaptotagmin functions as an endocytotic receptor at synapses (e.g. see Ref. 35.Jorgensen E.M. Hartwieg E. Schuske K. Nonet M.L. Jin Y. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1995; 378: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). However, in non-neuronal cells, the levels of the ubiquitous synaptotagmins (e.g. synaptotagmins III, VI, VII, and IX) are so low that they are barely detectable with sensitive methods, making it unlikely that these synaptotagmins represent the long sought after receptors for endocytosis (25.Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang Z.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). The situation is different for SCAMPs. These proteins, although also abundant components of synaptic vesicles, are universally expressed at relatively high levels in all cells tested where they are components of the recycling vesicle population (2.Brand S.H. Laurie S.M. Mixon M.B. Castle J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18949-18957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Singleton D.R. Wu T.T. Castle J.D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2099-2107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus based on their distribution, SCAMPs perform functions that are universally shared by all recycling vesicles. We propose that SCAMPs function in endocytosis and may perform this function by directing the assembly of clathrin coats at the plasma membrane via intersectin and possibly other interacting EH domain proteins and at the trans-Golgi network via γ-synergin. The following evidence supports this hypothesis 1) SCAMPs contain N-terminal NPF repeats that are evolutionarily conserved. Since NPF repeats bind to EH domain proteins that in turn are often involved in clathrin-related functions, the presence of NPF repeats is indicative of a function related to the assembly and budding of clathrin coats. 2) Transfection of SCAMP1 with a deletion in the N-terminal NPF repeats inhibits endocytosis, consistent with a function in endocytosis that involves coupling of the N-terminal sequences to the transmembrane regions. 3) Two proteins with a known function in clathrin coats are specifically bound to the N-terminal NPF repeats of SCAMP1, namely intersectin and γ-synergin. For both proteins, a specific interaction was demonstrated by yeast-two hybrid assays and pulldowns. Furthermore, the pulldowns suggested that SCAMP1 forms a complex with AP-2 (Fig. 2). With these observations, SCAMPs are the only universally distributed transmembrane proteins that interact with components of the endocytic machinery. The large number of proteins with putative functions in clathrin-mediated endocytosis is staggering (for reviews, see Refs.36.Bauerfeind R. Galli T. De Camilli P. J. Neurocytol. 1996; 25: 701-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Schmid S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 511-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 38.Wigge P. McMahon H.T. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 339-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). It appears that all of these proteins (by the last count more than 20) directly or indirectly interact with each other. Strikingly, all of these proteins are cytosolic, with no structural link to the membranes on which they are supposed to act. In this regard, the identification of SCAMPs as intrinsic membrane proteins that are capable of recruiting components of the clathrin-dependent membrane budding machinery is of potential significance. These results also suggest a possible explanation for the findings that in synaptotagmin I and SCAMP1 knockout studies, no obvious defects in synaptic vesicle endocytosis were detected (7.Fernández-Chacón R. Alvarez de Toledo G. Hammer R.E. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32551-32554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 39.Geppert M. Goda Y. Hammer R.E. Li C. Rosahl T.W. Stevens C.F. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 717-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). Because SCAMP1 and synaptotagmin I are both abundant in synaptic vesicles, they could potentially be mutually redundant in synaptic vesicle endocytosis. In the transfection studies, overexpression of full-length SCAMP1 only had a mild inhibitory effect while the most severe inhibition was observed with truncated SCAMP1 from which the NPF repeats had been deleted (Fig. 3). This result suggests a model whereby the N-terminal NPF repeats of SCAMPs mediate the coupling of the transmembrane regions of SCAMP to the EH domain proteins intersectin and γ-synergin. In the absence of the NPF repeats, this coupling is disrupted, and the rest of SCAMP is a dominant negative. This model implies that the highly conserved transmembrane regions of SCAMPs perform a separate additional function in membrane budding, which is currently unknown. We thank Dr. M. Okamoto for providing the yeast two-hybrid library used for screening."

Bembenek M.E. Kaplin A.I. Dormán G. Olszewski J.D. Prestwich G.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4305-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 2.Safrany S.T.

The physiological importance of this process is underscored by its being under the control of signaling cascades. For example, cAMP and cGMP modulate the interconversion of PP-InsP5 and [PP]2-InsP4 in a receptor-dependent but unusual manner that bypasses the participation of both protein kinases A and G (3.Safrany S.T. Shears S.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1710-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, turnover of PP-InsP4 and PP-InsP5 is regulated by a specific mode of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization (4.Glennon M.C. Shears S.B. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Molecular switching by diphosphoinositol polyphosphates may contribute to regulating intracellular trafficking (1.Voglmaier S.M. Bembenek M.E. Kaplin A.I. Dormán G. Olszewski J.D. Prestwich G.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4305-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 2.Safrany S.T.

For example, PP-InsP5 represents the most potent known inhibitor of AP-3-dependent assembly of clathrin cages, a key step in the endocytic retrieval of discharged synaptosomal vesicles (5.Ye W. Ali N. Bembenek M.E. Shears S.B. Lafer E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1564-1568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of PP-InsP5 to InsP6 may switch AP-3 to a more active state (5.Ye W. Ali N. Bembenek M.E. Shears S.B. Lafer E.M. J. Biol.

There are other proteins that participate in intracellular trafficking that also bind PP-InsP5 very tightly, such as coatomer (6.Fleischer B. Xie J. Mayrleitner M. Shears S.B. Palmer D.J.

The high affinity with which PP-InsP5 binds to myelin proteolipid protein may be important for its vesicular delivery to the myelin sheath (9.Yamaguchi Y. Ikenaka K. Niinobe M. Yamada H. Mikoshiba K.

Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), that diphosphoinositol polyphosphates may participate in the regulation of mRNA export from the nucleus. These findings illustrate why it is of great interest to characterize the kinases and phosphatases that regulate the turnover of the diphosphoinositol polyphosphates. Recently, three InsP6kinases, two mammalian and one from yeast, have all been cloned (12.Saiardi A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Snowman A. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1323-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar,13.Schell M.J. Letcher A.J. Brearley C.A. Biber J. Murer H. Irvine R.F.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6599-6607Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) have previously cloned a humandiphosphoinositol-polyphosphatephosphohydrolase (hDIPP) that dephosphorylates PP-InsP5 and [PP]2-InsP4. The active site of this enzyme contains a Nudt (MutT) motif (14.Safrany S.T. Caffrey J.J. Yang X. Bembenek M.E. Moyer M.B. Burkhart W.A. Shears S.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6599-6607Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This motif is also present at the active site of a family of enzymes that hydrolyze nucleoside phosphates (15.Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. O'Handley S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25059-25062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), the metabolism of which may, therefore, sometimes compete with the diphosphoinositol polyphosphates. Such competition is apparent in hDIPP itself, which in addition to hydrolyzing PP-InsP5 and [PP]2-InsP4, also attacks diadenosine polyphosphates such as Ap6A and Ap5A (16.Safrany S.T. Ingram S.W.

The latter nucleoside phosphates are downstream effectors of a signaling cascade that regulates cardiac K ATP channels (17.Jovanovic A. Jovanovic S. Mays D.C. Lipsky J.J. Terzic A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and ryanodine receptors (18.Holden C.P. Padua R.A. Geiger J.D. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 574-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Nudt motifs have also been identified in a transcriptional regulator (19.Gaudon C. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2229-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and in a protein regulating mRNA decay (20.Dunkley T. Parker R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5411-5422Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). We have now discovered additional members of the DIPP subfamily of Nudt proteins. The properties of these new enzymes are described below. We also propose that the unique catalytic profile of each of the individual DIPP isoforms can provide flexibility in the response times for molecular switches. hDIPP1 was obtained as described previously (14.Safrany S.T. Caffrey J.J. Yang X. Bembenek M.E. Moyer M.B. Burkhart W.A. Shears S.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6599-6607Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). PCR products encoding the appropriate open reading frame for hDIPP2α and hDIPP2β, minus both of the tandem ATG start codons, were each cloned into theBamHI and SalI sites of pQE30 (Qiagen). This strategy produces an N-terminal [His]6 tag in front of Lys-3 of the hDIPP2 isoforms, which were individually expressed inEscherichia coli. Induced cells were harvested and incubated for 1 h in 150 ml of Buffer A (300 mmNaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, with HCl) supplemented with 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mg/ml lysozyme. Cells were then lysed by three rapid freeze/thaw cycles. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was applied (0.8 ml/min) to a 10 × 60-mm nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow (Qiagen) column. After washing with 30 ml of Buffer A, the bound protein was eluted (0.8 ml/min) with 60 ml of a 0–150 mm imidazole gradient generated by mixing Buffer A and Buffer B (Buffer A plus 0.5 m imidazole). The column fractions were analyzed on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel, and fractions containing hDIPP2 were pooled and dialyzed against 2 × 2 liters of 25 mm Tris buffer containing 1 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.5, at 4 °C for 6 h. The dialyzed pooled fractions were then loaded (0.8 ml/min) onto a UNO Q-12 (15 × 68 mm) column (Bio-Rad). After washing with 30 ml of Buffer C (20 mm Tris with 1 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.5), protein was eluted (0.8 ml/min) with a 40-ml 0–400 mm NaCl gradient in Buffer C. Eluted fractions were screened for hDIPP2 by SDS-PAGE, and 10% (v/v) glycerol was added to the proteins before aliquots were frozen at −70 °C. DIPP-catalyzed hydrolysis of diadenosine polyphosphates and diphosphoinositol polyphosphates was analyzed by HPLC (10.Yang X. Safrany S.T. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35434-35440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 14.Safrany S.T. Caffrey J.J. Yang X. Bembenek M.E. Moyer M.B. Burkhart W.A. Shears S.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6599-6607Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Primary PCR reactions (25 μl) contained 250 pg of Marathon-Ready human fetal kidney or adult heart cDNA (CLONTECH) and the 5′-primer GAAGTTCAAGCCCAACC, which is homologous to nt 179–195 of clone A (see Fig. 2). Antisense primers from increasingly distal portions of clone C (see Fig. 2) were used as the 3′-primer in each reaction. Generally, primary PCR reactions did not yield visible products by gel analysis. Therefore, 1-μl aliquots of these reactions were used to prime secondary PCR reactions containing a pair of nested primers. The nested 5′-oligonucleotide used to amplify PCRα and PCRβ (see Fig. 2) is homologous to nt 183–203 of clone A. The primary and nested 3′-primers in that reaction are complimentary to nt 4617–4634 and 4567–4587 of clone C, respectively. Individual products from secondary PCR reactions were gel purified, cloned into pCR-XL-Topo (Invitrogen), and analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion, PCR, and/or DNA sequencing. All sequencing was performed using AmpliTaq FS in a PCR cycling protocol with either dRhodamine or BigDye chemistry (Perkin-Elmer), and reactions were analyzed on an ABI 373 or 377 gel apparatus. The Wisconsin Package of programs (GCG Inc.) was used for all DNA sequence analysis. PCR reactions were performed as described above using human heart Marathon-Ready cDNA (CLONTECH) with primary and nested sense primers homologous to nt 3724–3751 and 3750–3777 of clone C, respectively. Primary and nested antisense primers were adaptor primers 1 and 2 (CLONTECH), respectively. “Touchdown” PCR cycling conditions were employed to improve specificity of amplification. Individual PCR products were gel-purified and cloned as described above, and positive clones were identified by colony hybridization using a DIG-labeled probe spanning nt 3661–3829 of clone C. Positive clones were sequenced as described above. Human multiple tissue Northern blots were purchased from CLONTECH. DIG reagents were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. DIG-labeled DNA probes (see Fig. 2) were generated with a PCR labeling kit using specific primer pairs. Blots were hybridized overnight in DIG Easy Hyb at 50 °C with ∼50 ng of DIG-labeled DNA/ml of hybridization solution. Blots were washed up to 0.1 × SSC at 50 °C (Fig. 4 A) or 0.5 × SSC at 65 °C (Fig. 4 B) and analyzed with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-DIG antibodies followed by chemiluminescent detection with CDP-STAR. Filters were stripped in boiling 1.0% SDS, rinsed, and rehybridized with a β-actin probe. The C-terminal peptide (VTAAPPSGVPSSIR) of mDIPP2α (accession number AA016479) was synthesized and conjugated to keyhole limpet hemacyanin protein, and the conjugated peptide was used to raise antisera in New Zealand White rabbits (Sigma). Human K562 and SW480 cells were lysed by incubation and vortexing in lysis buffer: 50 mm β-glycerophosphate (pH 8.2), 250 mmsucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 4 mm CHAPS, 250 μm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride, 10 μm trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido(4-guanidino)-butane, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Extracts were centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and 300 μg of supernatant protein were separated on a 4–12% BisTris NuPAGE polyacrylamide gel (Novex) and transferred to nitrocellulose by Western blotting. Filters were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween-20 (0.1%, v/v) for 1 h. During blocking, 30-μl aliquots of antisera and pre-immune sera were diluted to 0.5 ml in 3% bovine serum albumin (w/v) in Tris-buffered saline/Tween-20. An identical aliquot of antisera was also incubated with 10 nmol of unconjugated mDIPP2 peptide. Samples were rocked at 4 °C for 1 h and then incubated with filters for 1 h in 15 ml of 5% nonfat dry milk (1:500 final dilution of serum). After several washes, filters were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min. Unbound secondary antibody was washed off, and antibody-antigen complexes were detected (Pierce SuperSignal reagent). Diadenosine polyphosphates and diphosphoinositol polyphosphates were obtained as described previously (10.Yang X. Safrany S.T. Shears S.B. J. Biol.

The clone C cDNA (see Fig. 2) was provided by Dr. T. Nagase, Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Chiba, Japan. PepTool v1.1 was purchased from BioTools Inc., Edmonton, Canada. We have renamed our original hDIPP (14.Safrany S.T. Caffrey J.J. Yang X. Bembenek M.E. Moyer M.B. Burkhart W.A. Shears S.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6599-6607Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) as hDIPP1. Its nucleotide sequence was used as a query to search the genome data bases for additional proteins that might also hydrolyze diphosphoinositol polyphosphates. A human EST cDNA, clone A (Fig. 2), was identified and sequenced. This 1191-nt cDNA is 56% identical to hDIPP1 at the nucleotide level. Clone A contains a 543-nt open reading frame defined at the 5′-end by two tandem initiator codons in a context (TCTATGATGA) that fashions a relatively weak Kozak consensus. There is an inframe TGA stop codon 153 nt upsteam of the more 5′ of the two candidate start codons (Fig. 2), indicating that the coding region of clone A is complete. The 5′-UTR is exceptionally G/C-rich (84%) and contains a perfect run of six CAG repeats, although this number is considered to be just below the threshold length that would make it a candidate for polymorphic expansion (21.Albanese V. Holbert S. Saada C. Meier-Ewert S. Lebre A.-S. Moriniere S. Bougueleret L. Le Gall I. Weissenbach J. Lennon G. Lehrach H. Cohen D. Cann H.M. Neri C. Genomics. 1998; 47: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The 5′-end of the nucleotide sequence of clone A terminates in a NotI site. Because the cDNA library from which clone A was isolated had been digested with NotI during construction, it is possible this cDNA may be truncated at the 5′-end. The 3′-UTR of clone A terminates with an 18-nt poly(A) tail, which begins 16 and 34 nt downstream of two ATTAAA polyadenylation signals. These motifs are slightly less efficient as polyadenylation signals compared with the canonical AATAAA (22.Sheets M.D. Ogg S.C. Wickens M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5799-5805Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). We also identified a 1334-nt EST cDNA, clone B, that substantially overlaps clone A (Fig. 2). The overlapping regions of these clones are identical, but clone B lacks most of the 5′-UTR that is present in clone A. However, clone B has an additional 292 nt of 3′-UTR, terminating in a poly(A) tail that begins 19 nt downstream of a rare, noncanonical polyadenylation signal (AGTAAA). The latter is about 30% as effective a polyadenylation signal compared with AATAAA, at least in vitro (22.Sheets M.D. Ogg S.C. Wickens M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5799-5805Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Clones A and B encode a putative 180-residue protein (20,306 Daltons) that we have named hDIPP2α. This protein is 76% identical to hDIPP1 at the amino acid level (Fig. 3). Most of the differences between hDIPP2α and hDIPP1 are because of divergence in the 45-amino acid residues at the C terminus of hDIPP2α. All but 3 of the 23 residues of the hDIPP1 Nudt motif are conserved in hDIPP2α (Fig. 3). Several catalytically essential residues in hDIPP1 that were recently identified in a mutagenic study (10.Yang X. Safrany S.T. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35434-35440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) were also all conserved in hDIPP2α, namely (i) the glycine triad at the N terminus of the Nudt catalytic motif, (ii) Glu66 and Glu70within the Nudt motif, (iii) Gly residues within a GX 2GX 6G consensus (underlined in Fig. 3), and (iv) Phe84 and His91, which are important primarily for [PP]2-InsP4 hydrolysis. Finally, much of the predicted secondary structure of hDIPP2α and hDIPP1 is also conserved (Fig. 3). We hybridized a human multiple tissue Northern blot with a DNA probe (P1, see Fig. 2) that is specific for the coding region of hDIPP2α (and also for the hDIPP2β isoform described below). Signals of 1.5 and 1.8 kb were detected in heart, and, to a lesser extent, in skeletal muscle, kidney, placenta, and pancreas (Fig.4 A). Similar results (not shown) were obtained when we used a probe (P2, see Fig. 2) against the common 3′-UTR of clones A and B. Hybridization with P1 or P2 also revealed an intense mRNA signal of 4.2 kb in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney and pancreas, with weaker expression in brain, placenta, lung and liver (Fig. 4 A). To pursue the nature of this 4.2-kb mRNA, we noted that the 3′-terminal 270 bp of clone B overlaps the 5′-end of a 6.4-kb human brain cDNA (clone C, Fig. 2) (23.Seki N. Ohira M. Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Miyajima N. Nakajima D. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1997; 4: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hybridized a second human multiple tissue Northern blot with a probe (P3; Fig. 2) homologous to nt 1494–1792 of clone C, i.e. downstream of the 3′ termini of clones A and B. The P3 probe detected a 4.2-kb mRNA with the same pattern of expression as was seen with probes P1 and P2, but the 1.5- and 1.8-kb DIPP2 mRNAs were not detected (Fig.4 B). A more distal clone C probe (P4; Fig. 2) gave similar results (data not shown). These data suggest that the 4.2-kb message is a hDIPP2 mRNA comprised of clones A or B fused to ∼3 kb of the 5′-end of clone C. We tested this prediction by PCR amplification experiments using several 5′-primers from the proximal end of clone B and various, progressively more distal, 3′-primers complimentary to segments of clone C (see “Experimental Procedures”). Human fetal kidney and adult heart cDNA were used as templates. All of the primer pairs that were tested generated single PCR fragments of the expected size based on our prediction of the structure of the 4.2-kb mRNA. Several PCR fragments were cloned and, when sequenced (for example, the 4.4-kb PCRα clone, Fig. 2), confirmed that the 4.2-kb mRNA is comprised of clones A and/or B fused to the 5′-end of clone C. To map the 3′-end of the 4.2-kb hDIPP2 mRNA, we searched for functional polyadenylation signals at the appropriate location in clone C (see Fig. 2), by identifying homologous EST cDNA sequences containing poly(A) tails. These ESTs fell into two categories. The first group (which includes clone D in Fig. 2) has poly(A) tails attached to nt 3610, which is 20 nt downstream of a canonical AATAAA polyadenylation signal. The second set of EST cDNAs (which includes clone E in Fig. 2) has poly(A) tails attached to nt 4125. The candidate signal for this polyadenylation is the AATACA hexanucleotide (22.Sheets M.D. Ogg S.C. Wickens M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5799-5805Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 24.Hervé D. Rogard M. Lévi-Strauss M. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 32: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which begins 20 nt upstream of the poly(A) tail. Because this is a rare, noncanonical signal, we further studied its functionality by performing 3′-RACE reactions on human heart cDNA using a sense PCR primer homologous to nt 3750–3777 of clone C (see “Experimental Procedures”). Seven independent 3′-RACE clones were identified and sequenced. All terminated in poly(A) tails (17–52 residues) at positions homologous to nt 4123–4125 of clone C (Fig. 2), strongly suggesting that the AATACA motif at nt 4105 is indeed a functional polyadenylation signal. Thus, we have obtained strong evidence that an array of alternate polyadenylation signals (Fig. 2) gives rise to multiple mRNAs for hDIPP2α with identical open reading frames that differ only in the length of their 3′-UTR. Using the same human heart cDNA from which PCRα was identified, we amplified another 4.4-kb PCR product (PCRβ, Fig. 2). The latter was identical in sequence to PCRα, except for the presence of an additional CAG codon in the hDIPP2α coding region (Fig. 2). The resultant putative protein, which we named hDIPP2β (Fig. 3), comprises 181 amino acids (calculated molecular mass, 20,434 Daltons). The additional CAG codon is predicted to code for Gln86 in hDIPP2β (Fig. 3). An identical open reading frame for hDIPP2β was identified in a PCR product amplified from human fetal kidney cDNA (data not shown). Furthermore, a 915-bp human EST that encodes hDIPP2β (clone F; Fig. 2) was identified and sequenced. Putative DIPP2α and DIPP2β open reading frames also occur in a number of independently isolated mouse and rat EST cDNA clones (Table I). Therefore, there is considerable evidence for the existence of molecular clones for both DIPP2α and DIPP2β in three mammalian species.Table IMouse and rat ESTs encoding putative DIPP2α and DIPP2β proteinsGenBank™ Accession numberSpeciesDIPP2 isoformTissueIdentityaPercent of amino acid homology of predicted EST open reading frame with hDIPP2α.OverlapbLength of amino acid overlap between predicted EST open reading frame and hDIPP2α.%AA271815MouseαPooled organs98.3123AA059976MouseαFetus94.9119AA106818MouseαEmbryo99.1117AA204297MouseαThymus92.898AI410552RatαHeart97.9145AI168995RatαKidney98.0153AI599256RatαEmbryo97.7135AI170011RatαLiver98.2115AA592492MouseβMyotubes92.7179AA230555MouseβFetus95.5111AI172168RatβMuscle95.1165AI599827RatβEmbryo97.3153AI105415RatβKidney98.2115AI411034RatβKidney96.4112a Percent of amino acid homology of predicted EST open reading frame with hDIPP2α.b Length of amino acid overlap between predicted EST open reading frame and hDIPP2α.

The values of the kinetic parameters for this reaction, most notably the exceptionally high affinity for PP-InsP5 (K m = 4.2 nm), were very similar to those for hDIPP1 (TableII). However, purified, recombinant hDIPP2β (Fig. 5, lane 3) was 5-fold less active against PP-InsP5 compared with both hDIPP2α and hDIPP1 (TableII).Figure 6HPLC analysis of PP-InsP5 and [PP]2-InsP4 dephosphorylation by hDIPP2α. ∼2500 dpm of PP-[3H]InsP5 were incubated with 0.4 ng of hDIPP2α (upper panel), and ∼1700 dpm of [PP]2-[3H]InsP4 were incubated with 20 ng of hDIPP2α (lower panel) for 15 min as described under “Experimental Procedures” (filled circles).

Fig. 6 B shows that hDIPP2α is also active against [PP]2-InsP4 (which is formed by further phosphorylation of PP-InsP5, see Fig. 1). Note that in these reactions the PP-InsP5 reaction product did not accumulate (Fig. 6), because hDIPP2α rapidly dephosphorylated this material to InsP6 (see above). We had only limiting amounts of [PP]2-InsP4, so we could not determine theK m and V max for this reaction. Instead, we determined the value of the first order rate constants for [PP]2-InsP4 hydrolysis.

These signals are recognized by specific receptor proteins, which are either components of the cytosol (e.g. signal recognition particle for the endoplasmic reticulum (1.Brodsky J.L. Phoenix D.A. Protein Targeting and Translocation. Portland Press Ltd., London1998: 169-191Crossref Google Scholar) or importin α for nuclear proteins (2.Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev.

Phoenix D.A. Protein Targeting and Translocation. Portland Press Ltd., London1998: 231-248Crossref Google Scholar)). Following recognition of the targeting signal and subsequent routing of the receptor-cargo complex to the actual import site, the protein is transported into the organelle. Generally, proteins are released from their receptors prior to import. However, in the case of nuclear protein import the receptor dissociates after transport through the nuclear pore complex, followed by export of the receptor back to the cytosol (3.Hovius R. Phoenix D.A. Protein Targeting and Translocation. Portland Press Ltd., London1998: 231-248Crossref Google Scholar). For peroxisomal matrix proteins comparable mechanisms may exist (4.Van der Klei I.J. Veenhuis M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Sorting of these proteins is mediated by specific targeting signals, termed PTS1 and PTS2. The PTS1 is located at the extreme carboxyl terminus of most peroxisomal matrix proteins and consists of the tripeptide SKL-COOH or a conserved variant thereof (5.Gould S.J. Keller G.A. Hosken N.

In such mutants the PTS2 protein import machinery is normally functioning, which indicates that both pathways can act independently in yeast. This was confirmed by the finding that in PEX7 null mutants, which lack the PTS2 receptor Pex7p, PTS2 proteins are mislocated in the cytosol, whereas PTS1 proteins are still properly imported (18.Marzioch M.

Our current working model of PTS1 protein import in H. polymorpha includes that in the Pex5p-cargo complex is translocated across the peroxisomal membrane into the organellar matrix, followed by dissociation and subsequent export of Pex5p from the matrix back to the cytosol (4.Van der Klei I.J. Veenhuis M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This model is based on the finding that in this organism Pex5p is present both inside peroxisomes and the cytosol (17.Van der Klei I.J. Hilbrands R.E. Swaving G.J. Waterham H.R.W. Vrieling E.G.

Also, evidence has been obtained that Pex4p, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, plays a crucial role in recycling of Pex5p back to the cytosol (29.Van der Klei I.J. Hilbrands R.E. Kiel J.A.K.W.

This was evident from the finding that overexpression of PEX5 suppresses the PTS1 protein import defect in H. polymorpha Δpex4 cells. Remarkably, in these cells a significant portion of Pex5p accumulated at the inner surface of the peroxisomal membrane (29.Van der Klei I.J. Hilbrands R.E. Kiel J.A.K.W. Rasmussen S.W. Cregg J.M. Veenhuis M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3608-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A likely explanation for these observations is that the recycling of Pex5p is hampered in the absence of Pex4p thus making the import of newly synthesized matrix proteins dependent on newly formed Pex5p. In this paper we show that, like in Δpex4 cells, overexpression of PEX5 also significantly stimulates PTS1-protein import in Δpex14 cells. In Δpex14 cells overexpressing PEX5 significant amounts of Pex5p accumulate at the outer surface of the peroxisomal membrane, which suggested that (under these conditions) Pex14p is not necessary for the association of Pex5p with the peroxisomal membrane. The H. polymorpha strains used in this study are listed in Table I .

Site-directed integration of the plasmids at the PAOX locus was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Strains containing multiple copies of the pHIPX4 derivatives were selected as reported earlier (29.Van der Klei I.J. Hilbrands R.E. Kiel J.A.K.W. Rasmussen S.W. Cregg J.M. Veenhuis M.

First the zeocine selection cassette was taken from pPICZa (Table I) as a 1.1-kb MluI (Klenow fill-in of sticky ends)-BamHI fragment and inserted intoAsp718 (Klenow fill-in of sticky ends)-BamHI-digested pBluescript II KS+ (TableI), resulting in pFEM39. Subsequently, a 2.0-kbNotI-BglII fragment, containing the alcohol oxidase promoter region (PAOX) and amine oxidase terminator region (TAMO), was taken from pHIPX4 (Table I) and inserted into NotI-BamHI0-digested pFEM39, resulting in pHIPZ4. The chimeric gene encoding GFP fused to the targeting signal of AO (LARF-COOH) was constructed by polymerase chain reaction-mediated amplification of the GFP gene of pEGFP-C1 (Table I) using the following oligonucleotides (oligonucleotides were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc.): upstream 5′-AGA AAGCTT ATG GTG AGC AAG GGC-3′ (HindIII site underlined) and downstream 5′-CCC GTCGAC TTAGAA TCT GGC CAG CTT GTA CAG CTC GTC-3′ (SalI site underlined and the nucleotides that code for the tetrapeptide LARF are depicted in italics). For the construction of the gene encoding GFP fused to the targeting signal of CAT (SKI-COOH) the following primers were used: upstream 5′-CCC GGATCC ATG GTG AGC AAG GGC GAG-3′ (BamHI site underlined) and downstream 5′-CCCGTCGAC TTA GAT CTT CGA CTT GTA CAG CTC GTC-3′ (SalI site underlined and the nucleotides that code for the tripeptide SKI are depicted in italics). The polymerase chain reaction products were ligated as 0.8-kbBamHI-SalI or HindIII-SalI fragments in pHIPZ4, digested with BamHI-SalI orHindIII-SalI. The resulting plasmids, pHIPZ4-GFP .SKI and pHIPZ4-GFP .LARF, were linearized with SphI and integrated at the PAOXlocus of H. polymorpha WT and Δpex14::PAOX PEX5 mc.

Previously, we observed that overexpression ofPEX5 restored the formation of peroxisomes in H. polymorpha Δpex4 cells (29.Van der Klei I.J. Hilbrands R.E. Kiel J.A.K.W. Rasmussen S.W. Cregg J.M. Veenhuis M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3608-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To determine whether this phenomenon also occurs in other H. polymorpha pex mutants, aPEX5 overexpression cassette (PAOX PEX5) was integrated in two or multiple (3.Hovius R. Phoenix D.A.

Cells of these strains were incubated for 24 h in methanol-containing media to induce the PAOX and the major peroxisomal PTS1 proteins AO and DHAS. None of the strains showed significant growth on methanol indicating that full restoration of peroxisome formation did not occur in any of the strains. We subsequently examined thin sections of KMnO4-fixed cells from these cultures for the presence of peroxisomal structures. Methanol-grown WT cells, used as a control, characteristically contain several large peroxisomes (Fig.1 A). In Δpex1, Δpex3, Δpex6, and pex10−1 cells overexpressingPEX5, such organelles were invariably absent (Fig.1 B, pex10−1; others not shown). However, in Δpex14::PAOX PEX5 mccells the presence of several peroxisomes was evident. The size of these organelles was slightly reduced compared with those present in WT control cells (Fig. 1 D). In order to compare the Pex5p levels in WT, Δpex14 and Δpex14 overproducing Pex5p Western blotting experiments were performed. These experiments revealed that methanol-induced WT and Δpex14 cells contain similar levels of Pex5p. The Pex5p level was, however, significantly increased in strains containing two or multiple copies of the PAOX PEX5 overexpression cassette (Fig. 2). Densitometric scanning of blots prepared from crude extracts of methanol-grown WT cells andΔpex14::P AOX PEX5 mc cells induced for 24 h on methanol-containing media revealed that in Δpex14::PAOX PEX5 mcthe amount of Pex5p was approximately 100-fold higher than in WT control cells. Much lower overproduction of Pex5p (i.e. a 20-fold increase compared with WT cells) was obtained in a Δpex14 strain containing only two copies of the PAOX PEX5 cassette (Δpex14::PAOX PEX5 2c) upon growth for 16 h on glycerol-containing medium. Examination of ultrathin sections prepared from KMnO4-fixed cells of this culture revealed that also a 20-fold increase in Pex5p levels resulted in the formation of small peroxisomes in H. polymorphaΔpex14 (Fig. 1 E). In methanol-induced H. polymorpha Δpex14 cells normal peroxisomes are absent. Instead these cells contain peroxisomal membrane remnants that contain a very minor portion of AO and DHAS, whereas the bulk of these proteins is mislocated in the cytosol (24.Komori M. Rasmussen S.W. Kiel J.A.K.W. Baerends R.J.S. Cregg J.M. van der Klei I.J. Veenhuis M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical analysis of glycerol-grown Δpex14::P AOX PEX5 2c cells revealed that the small peroxisomes that are formed in these cells contain the PTS1 proteins AO (Fig.3 A) and DHAS (not shown). Similarly, the larger organelles present in methanol-inducedΔpex14::P AOX PEX5 mccells are characterized by significant amounts of AO (not shown) and DHAS protein (Fig. 3 B). Judged from the distribution of the labeling, a portion of these matrix proteins was still mislocated in the cytosol. By using antibodies against Pex3p, a peroxisomal membrane protein, labeling was obtained at the membrane of these organelles (Fig. 3 C), indicating that they indeed represent peroxisomes. Remarkably, import of a third PTS1 protein, catalase (CAT), was not significantly stimulated by Pex5p overproduction (Fig.3 D). As expected, the location of the PTS2 protein amine oxidase remained cytosolic in Δpex14::P AOX PEX5 mccells (data not shown). The immunocytochemical data were confirmed biochemically by cell fractionation experiments. To this end post-nuclear supernatants, prepared from methanol-grown WT cells or methanol-induced Δpex14 and Δpex14::P AOX PEX5 mccells, were subjected to sucrose density centrifugation (Fig.4). In gradients prepared from WT cells, peroxisomes migrate to a high density corresponding to 54% sucrose (fraction 6, Fig. 4 A), indicated by a distinct peak of AO and CAT activity. Also the peroxisomal membrane marker Pex3p is present in these fractions, as evident from Western blots prepared from the gradient fractions (inset in Fig. 4 A). The AO and CAT activities detected in the top fractions of the gradient most likely are due to leakage of these proteins as a result of the fractionation procedure (37.Van der Klei I.J. van der Heide M. Baerends R.J.S. Rechinger K.B. Nicolay K. Kiel J.A.K.W. Veenhuis M. Curr. Genet. 1998; 34: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the gradient of Δpex14cells (Fig. 4 B) AO, CAT, and Pex3p are absent at high densities. Instead, AO and CAT activities are present at the top of the gradient, indicative for a cytosolic location. Pex3p migrated to a density corresponding to 37% sucrose (fraction 17, Western blot included in Fig. 4 B). Previously, evidence was provided using immunocytochemistry that the peroxisomal membrane remnants, present in Δpex14 cells, contained Pex3p and very small amounts of AO and DHAS (24.Komori M. Rasmussen S.W. Kiel J.A.K.W. Baerends R.J.S. Cregg J.M. van der Klei I.J. Veenhuis M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Hence, these structures most likely migrated to a density corresponding to 37% sucrose (fraction 17) of the gradient prepared from Δpex14 cells. Gradients of methanol-induced Δpex14::P AOX PEX5 mccells again displayed a prominent peak of AO activity at 54% sucrose (fraction 7, Fig. 4 C); also Pex3p was localized at this position (Western blot included in Fig. 4 C). However, significant amounts of AO activity, exceeding those of WT controls, were also detected in the top fractions of this gradient (fraction 18–25) most likely representing the cytosolic portion of the AO protein demonstrated by immunocytochemistry (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, CAT activity (Fig. 4 C) and CAT protein, as determined by Western blotting (data not shown), was only detected in the top fractions of this gradient, thus confirming the immunocytochemical data that the import of CAT was not stimulated in Δpex14::P AOX PEX5 mccells. To obtain additional evidence that the AO activity peak detected at 54% sucrose in the Δpex14::P AOX PEX5 mcgradient indeed represented membrane-bound AO protein and was not due to the presence of dense AO protein aggregates and/or crystalloids, these fractions were subjected to floatation centrifugation. As shown in Fig. 5, both AO activity and the peroxisomal membrane protein Pex3p floated to lower densities and comigrated in a distinct protein peak at approximately 50% sucrose, indicating that AO is indeed membrane-bound. Overproduction of Pex5p in Δpex14 cells significantly stimulated import of the PTS1 proteins AO and DHAS but not of CAT. Possibly, this may be related to differences in affinities of H. polymorpha Pex5p for the PTS1 sequences of these proteins, i.e. LARF-COOH in case of AO, NKL-COOH in case of DHAS, and SKI-COOH in case of CAT (8.Hansen H. Didion T. Thiemann A. Veenhuis M. Roggenkamp R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 235: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 9.Didion T. Roggenkamp R. FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To analyze this possibility, we constructed chimeric genes encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the respective targeting signals of AO and CAT (GFP.LARF and GFP.SKI, respectively). These genes were introduced in Δpex14::P AOX PEX5 mcand a WT control strain, and the location of their translation products was determined. In H. polymorpha WT cells the two GFP fusion proteins were efficiently targeted to the peroxisomes, as indicated by the punctate patterns observed by fluorescence microscopy (data not shown) and immunocytochemistry, using specific α-GFP antibodies (Fig.6 A, GFP.LARF and GFP.SKI, not shown). However, in Δpex14::P AOX PEX5 mccells, producing either GFP.LARF or GFP.SKI, a diffuse fluorescence pattern was observed, indicative for a cytosolic location (data not shown).

Uptake of fatty acids into cells is a controlled process determined in part by a regulated import/export system that is controlled at least by two key groups of proteins, i.e. the fatty acid transport protein (FATP) and acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS), which facilitate, respectively, the transport of fatty acids across the cell membrane and catalyze their esterification to prevent their efflux. Previously it was shown that the expression of theFATP-1 and ACS genes was controlled by insulin and by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists in liver or in adipose tissue. The aim of this investigation was to determine the effects of retinoic acid derivatives on the expression ofFATP-1 and ACS. In several cultured cell lines, it was shown that the expression of both the FATP-1 andACS mRNAs was specifically induced at the transcriptional level by selective retinoid X receptor (RXR) but not by retinoic acid receptor (RAR) ligands. This effect was most pronounced in hepatoma cell lines. A similar induction of FATP-1 andACS mRNA levels was also observed in vivoin Zucker diabetic fatty rats treated with the RXR agonist, LGD1069 (4-[1-(3,5,5,8,8-pentamethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthyl)ethenyl]benzoic acid). Through the use of heterodimer-selective compounds, it was demonstrated that the modulatory effect of these rexinoids onFATP-1 and ACS gene expression was mediated through activation of RXR in the context of the PPAR-RXR heterodimer. The observation that both RXR and PPAR agonists can stimulate the transcription of genes implicated in lipid metabolism, suggest that rexinoids may also act as lipid-modifying agents and support a role of the permissive PPAR-RXR heterodimer in the control of insulin sensitivity.

Circulating fatty acids can then cross the plasma membrane either by virtue of their lipid solubility (1.Higgins C.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 393-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) or by being actively taken up by cells in a process mediated by proteins of the fatty acid transport protein (FATP)1 family. The best characterized of these FATPs is FATP-1, a plasma membrane protein of 63 kDa, which has been shown to actively transport long chain fatty acids (2.Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Another protein found to be indirectly involved in the process of long chain fatty acid uptake is the acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS). Whereas FATP acts as a transporter of fatty acids, the role of ACS is confined to prevent the efflux of fatty acids through an esterification process. Two other specialized membrane transport system for fatty acids have been described. The first one is the fatty acid translocase (FAT) or glycoprotein CD36 (3.Abumrad N.A. Forest C.C. Regen D.M.

Three retinoic acid receptors (RARs), termed RARα, -β, and -γ, and three retinoid X receptor (RXR), designated RXRα, -β, and -γ, are classically thought to transduce most of the effects of retinoic acid (RA) on gene expression. Both 9-cis RA (9c-RA) and all-trans-RA (at-RA) can directly bind and activate RARs, whereas RXR only binds 9c-RA. Recently, new specific ligands for RXR and/or a particular dimers have been developed (13.Lala D.S. Mukherjee R. Schulman I.G. Canan Koch S.S. Dardashti L.J. Nazdan A.M. Croston G.E. Evans R.M. Heyman R.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 450-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). These selective RXR agonists, called rexinoids, function as insulin sensitizers and have beneficial effects on the hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in mouse models of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and obesity (14.Mukherjee R. Davies P.A.J. Crombie D.L. Bischoff E.D. Cesario R.M. Jow L. Hamann L.G. Boehm M.F. Mondon C.E. Nadzan A.M. Paterniti J.R. Heyman R.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Some of these compounds, such as LGD1069 and LG100268 (15.Boehm M.F. Zhang L. McClurg M.R. Berger E. Wagoner M. Mais D.E. Suto C.M. Davies P.J.A. Heyman R.A. Nadzan A.M. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38 (3145): 3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), selectively induce the activity of the RXR homodimer and the RXR-LXR and RXR-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) heterodimers, but not of RXR-RAR or RXR-TR heterodimers. By contrast, LG100754 has been identified as an antagonist of the RXR homodimer but it activates RXR when it is paired as an heterodimer with PPAR or RAR (13.Lala D.S. Mukherjee R. Schulman I.G. Canan Koch S.S. Dardashti L.J. Nazdan A.M. Croston G.E. Evans R.M. Heyman R.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 450-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This ligand, hence, is different from the other activators of RAR-RXR heterodimers, because it was previously thought that retinoids can only activate RAR in the RAR-RXR heterodimer, whereas RXR was believed to be a silent partner in this setting. Because retinoid effects on gene expression can be determined by multiple dimer combinations, including but not limited to RXR-RAR, RXR-RXR, and RXR-PPAR, these rexinoids make the determination possible of which heterodimer is specifically involved in gene regulation and, hence, they provide tools for a better understanding of RXR action and the development of new drugs. We suggested previously that thiazolidinedione PPARγ activators might improve glucose secondary to tissue-specific co-regulation of the several proteins involved in fatty acid uptake such as lipoprotein lipase (16.Schoonjans K. Peinado-Onsurbe J. Lefebvre A.M. Heyman R. Briggs M. Cayet D. Deeb S. Staels B. Auwerx J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5336-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar), FATP-1, and ACS target genes (17.Martin G. Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 11: 35-47Google Scholar), which ultimately alter fatty acid partitioning. RXR-PPAR heterodimers, however, have been shown to respond to both RXR and PPAR ligands (18.Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Noonan D.J. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculated that RXR ligands could have similar effects and be potential modulators of the expression of the FATP-1and ACS genes through activation of RXR in the RXR-PPAR heterodimer. In order to confirm the implication of the PPAR-RXR heterodimer in the improvement of glucose homeostasis, we studied the regulation of the FATP-1 and ACS genes by several synthetic retinoic acid analogues. This allowed us to determine the composition of the dimer that was involved in this process and could provide us with a better understanding of the regulation of lipid uptake by nuclear receptors. Our results implicate the PPAR-RXR heterodimer as the molecular target mediating the effects of rexinoids on fatty acid partitioning leading to an improvement of insulin sensitivity. at-RA was purchased from Sigma. 9c-RA, TTNPB (ethyl-p-[(E)-2-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphtyl)-1-propenyl]benzoic acid) (19.Mangelsdorf D.J.

Boehm at Ligand Pharmaceuticals. FAO cells are a well-differentiated subclone, derived from the rat hepatoma H4 IIEC3 cell line. They were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air in Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (200 IU/mL), and streptomycine (50 mg/mL) according to previously published procedures (21.Meunier-Dumort C. Poirier H. Forest C. Besnard P. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Culture medium was changed every 48 h. The human hepatoma cell line HepG2 was obtained from ECACC (Porton Down, Salisbury, United Kingdom), and the mouse preadipocyte cell line 3T3-L1 was from ATCC (Manassas, VA). These cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% lipid-depleted and dextran charcoal-treated fetal calf serum,l-glutamine, and antibiotics, unless stated otherwise. 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated initially by a 2-day treatment with dexamethasone (0.1 μm), isobutyl methyl xanthine (0.25 mm), and insulin (0.4 μm). Subsequently, the cells were maintained for an additional 8 days with insulin until complete differentiation. Caco2 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% of essential amino acids. Differentiation occurred spontaneously, and cells were treated after 7 days of differentiation process. Experiments were performed on subconfluent hepatoma cells maintained in culture under serum-free conditions. at-RA and 9c-RA were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, whereas oleic acid was complexed with bovine serum albumin (BSA) before addition to the cells. Actinomycin D treatment was performed 45 min before the treatment of the cells with retinoic acid treatment. Male Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats were purchased from Harlan at 7 weeks of age. Animals were housed four per cage and were maintained in a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle (lights were turned on at 7 a.m.). All animals had free access to laboratory chow and tap water. LGD1069, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day, was added to the diet of ZDF rats during 50 days. There were four animals per treatment group. Lean rats fed with either normal chow or chow supplemented with 30 mg/kg/day of LGD1069 served as nondiabetic controls. Animals were fasted overnight before sacrifice. Animals were anesthetized with ether and sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Tissues (liver, epididymal fat pad, skeletal muscle, and heart) were collected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen until analysis. RNA preparation, Northern blot hybridizations, and quantification of total cellular RNA were performed as described previously (22.Auwerx J. Deeb S. Brunzell J.D. Peng R. Chait A.C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2651-2655Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A mouse FATP-1 cDNA probe was obtained after cloning an RT-PCR fragment from mouse adipose tissue RNA (primers, 5′-ATG CGG GCT CCT GGA GCA GGA CAG CC-3′ and 5′-CTG CGT GTC AGG CAG GAT GCT CTC AGG CCC-3′) into pBluescript-KS. The insert was sequenced and found to be identical to the reported mouseFATP-1 sequence (2.Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). The rat ACS probe corresponds to the EcoRV restriction fragment of the ratACS cDNA (23.Schoonjans K. Staels B. Grimaldi P. Auwerx J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and β-actin was used as a control probe (24.Cleveland D.W. Lopata M.A. McDonald R.J. Cowan M.J. Rutter W.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1980; 20: 95-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar). Nuclei were prepared from FAO and differentiated 3T3-L1 cells that were treated either with 9c-RA or vehicle. Transcription run-on assays were performed as described by Nevins (25.Nevins J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Equivalent counts of nuclear RNA labeled with [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol) were hybridized for 36 h at 65 °C to 5 μg of FATP-1,ACS, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and vector DNA (pBluescript) immobilized on Hybond-C Extra filters (Amersham Life Science, Buckinghamshire, UK). After hybridization, filters were washed once at 21 °C for 10 min in 0.5 × SSC and 0.1% SDS and twice at 65 °C for 30 min and subsequently exposed to x-ray film (BIOMAX-MS, Eastman Kodak company, Rochester, NY). Quantitative analysis was performed using scanning densitometry (Bio-Rad GS670 densitometer, Hercules, CA). Radiolabeled [14C]oleate was added to water at 40 °C. Albumin (BSA; fraction V, fatty acid free, Sigma) was then added by gentle mixing from a concentrated stock (20 g/100 mL) to give a final molar ratio of 1/1, thereafter 2× Hanks' solution was added to obtain a 1× final solution. The radioactive fatty acid was allowed to equilibrate with the albumin for 45 min at 37 °C. The measurement of uptake of [14C]oleate (about 50 mCi/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) was carried out in 24- or 6-well plates with 106 cells/mL of medium. Before treatment, the cells were washed with 1× Hanks' solution. Retinoids (doses ranging from 10−9 to 10−6m) were added in fresh DMEM medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. After 48 h of treatment, cells were washed with 1× Hank's solution and incubated for one additional hour in serum-free, glucose-free medium. Cells were then washed once at 37 °C and twice at 23 °C with 1× Hanks' solution containing BSA. Hanks' solution without BSA was then added before the assay. A volume corresponding to 1 μCi of [14C]oleate albumin-bound solution was added in each well, and cells were incubated for 1 min at 21 °C. Incubation was stopped after 1 min with three washes of ice-cold 1× Hanks' solution without BSA. A complementary experiment has been performed to verify whether a specific cell surface binding of [14C]oleate could interfere with the assay. For this second assay, the cells were washed under more stringent conditions in 1× Hanks' solution containing 0.5% BSA. Cells were then lysed in 400 μL of 0.1% SDS solution. The lysate was counted for 5 min with 4 mL of scintillation solution. All assays were performed on triplicate points. We examined the regulation of FATP-1 and ACS gene expression upon retinoic acid treatment over a dose range from 10−8 to 10−5m in FAO cells cultured during 6 h. 9c-RA produced a dose-dependent increase of both FATP-1 and ACS mRNA levels in this hepatic cell line (Fig.1 A). A maximal increase forFATP-1 (>9-fold) and ACS (14-fold) was observed with a dose of 10−6m 9c-RA. FATP-1and ACS mRNA were also up-regulated by at-RA but to a much lesser extent than with 9c-RA (data not shown). We next determined whether FATP-1 levels were modified by retinoids in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2. 9c-RA also induced FATP-1and ACS (data not shown) mRNA after 24 h in HepG2 cells. This effect was already evident at a dose of 10−8m of 9c-RA (Fig. 1 B). However, no effect of at-RA on the expression of FATP-1 and ACSmRNA could be detected in HepG2 cells (data not shown). The strong induction of FATP-1 in hepatoma cells led us to investigate the regulation in other rat and human cell lines representative of tissues with a high fatty acid metabolism (i.e. adipose tissue and small intestine). 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells were therefore induced to differentiate, with a mixture of dexamethasone, isobutyl methyl xanthine, and insulin, and then treated with 9c-RA (10−9 to 10−6m during 24 h). 9c-RA induced both FATP-1and ACS (data not shown) mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner in these differentiated 3T3-L1 cells. A maximal increase was observed at 10−6m9c-RA (Fig. 1 C). The expression of FATP-1 and ACS mRNA was evaluated after retinoid treatment in the human colon adenocarcinoma cells Caco2. Both FATP-1 and ACS gene expression increased after 6 h of treatment with 9c-RA at 10−6m in this cell line. Under similar conditions, however, higher levels of induction of both mRNA species are nevertheless observed in FAO cells (Fig. 1 A) relative to Caco2 cells (Fig. 1 D). We next determined the relative contribution of transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes to the increase in mRNA levels of FATP-1, by using the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D. Prior addition of actinomycin D completely abolished the increase of FATP-1 (Fig.2 A) and ACS (data not shown) mRNA in 3T3-L1 and FAO cells. To assess the role of mRNA stability in the observed changes of the FATP-1mRNAs, RNA synthesis was blocked with actinomycin D 6 h after 9c-RA induction in FAO cells, and the relative rates of disappearance of FATP-1 mRNA were determined (Fig. 2, B andC). Disappearance rates of FATP mRNA were very similar before and after 9c-RA treatment, suggesting that 9c-RA did not change the stability of FATP-1 mRNA. Nuclear run-on analysis was then carried out to determine whether the induction of FATP-1 and ACS expression by 9c-RA was a direct consequence of enhanced gene transcription. FAO cells were treated for 4 h with 9c-RA (10−6m) (Fig.3), whereas differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated for 12 h with 9c-RA (10−6m) (Fig. 3). Control cells received vehicle only. Transcription rates for the FATP-1 and ACS genes were induced 2-fold and 2.8-fold, respectively, in FAO cells and 4- and 3-fold, respectively, in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells. In the retinoic acid-treated cells, transcription of the GAPDH gene was not affected in neither of the two cell lines. Because the stability of FATP mRNA is not altered by 9c-RA treatment, the induction ofFATP-1 mRNA is primarily the result of an increase in the transcription rate rather then being caused by alterations in mRNA stability. To determine whether the effect of retinoids on the regulation of FATP-1 andACS gene expression was mediated by RAR or RXR, both 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated either with at-RA or TTNPB (specific RAR agonists) or 9c-RA (an RAR/RXR panagonist). Interestingly, no effect of these retinoids onFATP-1 or ACS mRNA levels was observed in undifferentiated 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells (Figs.4 and 5). In differentiated 3T3-L1, no activation of FATP-1 and ACS gene expression was detectable after 24 h of treatment with at-RA or TTNPB. In contrast, a dose-dependent induction of bothFATP-1 (Fig. 4) and ACS (Fig.5) mRNA expression was observed 24 h after treatment with 9c-RA in the differentiated 3T3-L1 cells. Maximum induction of mRNA expression occurred at 10−6m 9c-RA (3.5- and 3-fold forFATP-1 and ACS, respectively). Furthermore, the fold induction of steady-state mRNA levels (Fig. 5) corresponds to the increase in transcription rates (Fig. 5) observed in 3T3-L1 cells.Figure 5Expression of ACS mRNA in undifferentiated and differentiated 3T3-L1 cells after treatment with the indicated concentrations of different retinoids.Differentiated (3T3-L1 Δ; filled triangles) or nondifferentiated (3T3-L1; open triangles) cells were treated for 24 h with different concentrations of each of the retinoids indicated. Northern blot analysis was carried out and blots were hybridized with an ACS probe as specified under “Experimental Procedures.” ACS mRNA was normalized against β-actin mRNA expression, and the results are expressed as percentages of values in control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To specify which RXR heterodimer combination induced FATP-1and ACS gene expression, a number of specific RXR ligands were used: 1) LGD1069 and LG100268, specific activators of RXR homodimers and PPAR-RXR or LXR-RXR, but without activity on RAR-RXR heterodimers; and 2) LG100754, an activator of PPAR-RXR and RAR-RXR heterodimers, which is unable to activate RXR homodimers. All these compounds enhance FATP-1 in a significant and dose-dependent manner in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes expression (Fig. 4; 4-fold activation at 10−6m with LGD1069, 3.6-fold induction at 10−6m with LG100268, and a 4-fold induction at 10−7m with LG100754). In contrast,ACS expression was not affected by LG100268 and LGD1069, whereas LG100754 induced ACS mRNA levels significantly (Fig. 5). Once again, none of these specific rexinoids have an effect on undifferentiated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (Figs. 5 and 6). To establish whether the induction of the FATP-1 and ACS was accompanied by a concomitant increase in fatty acid uptake into the cells, we measured [14C]oleate uptake in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells exposed to increasing doses of two prototypic retinoids, i.e.LG100754, an RXR agonist, and TTNPB, an RAR agonist (dose range 10−9 to 10−6m). LG100754 induces [14C]oleate uptake dose-dependently. A maximal induction of fatty acid uptake by 2-fold was observed at a concentration of 10−7m. No effect on [14C]oleate uptake was observed after TTNPB, confirming that this effect was specific for the rexinoids (Fig.6). We wanted to know whether these strong effects on FATP-1 and ACS gene expression in vitro could be translated into changes in mRNA expression in vivo. ZDF rats were therefore treated during 50 days with either no or increasing amounts of LGD1069 (0.3, 1.0, 3.0, 10 to 30 mg/kg/day; Fig. 7). In the liver, FATP-1 mRNA levels were significantly induced in a dose-dependent fashion by LGD1069 with a maximal effect at 30 mg/kg/day (Fig. 7). Interestingly, in adipose tissue,FATP-1 was only induced at the dose of 1 mg/kg/day (an effect lost at higher doses of LGD1069) in the ZDF rats. In the heart or skeletal muscle the expression of the FATP-1 gene was not affected by LGD1069 therapy. Similarly to FATP-1 mRNA,ACS mRNA levels were dose-dependently induced in the liver. No effect of LGD1069 was detected in adipose tissue, muscle, and heart. Also in lean animals, FATP andACS mRNA levels were only induced in the liver, whereas the changes observed in the other tissues, such as adipose tissue, did not reach significance. The results of this study demonstrate that RXR ligands control both FATP-1 and ACS gene expression in several cell types. In liver cell lines, FATP-1 and ACSmRNA levels have been shown previously to be strongly induced by PPARα activators, such as the fibrates (25.Nevins J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 26.Schoonjans K. Watanabe M. Suzuki H. Mahfoudi A. Krey G. Wahli W. Grimaldi P. Staels B. Yamamoto T. Auwerx J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28210-28217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The transcriptional induction of the ACS gene is mediated by the interaction of the activated PPARα-RXR heterodimer with a cognate response element in the promotor region of the ACS (25.Nevins J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Hence, it was not too surprising to observe a strong induction of FATP-1 andACS expression in hepatoma cell lines by specific RXR activators, which activate the other partner of the PPARα-RXR heterodimer. Long chain fatty acid transport in hepatoma cells seems to be tightly controlled by retinoic acid, because l-FABP, a cytoplasmic protein implicated in long chain fatty acid uptake, is also regulated by 9c-RA (28.Poirier H. Braissant O, N., I. Wahli W. Besnard P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 480-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The co-induction ofFATP-1 and ACS expression by rexinoids, which is similar to the co-induction of both these genes by fibrates furthermore indicates that rexinoids and fibrates may have similar metabolic effects on rat and human liver. This has already been suggested by the observation that both retinoids and peroxisome proliferators stimulate transcription of genes encoding the peroxisomal β-oxidation enzymes (29.Reddy J.K. Lalwani N.D. CRC Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1983; 12: 1-58Crossref Scopus (868) Google Scholar, 30.Hertz R. Bar-Tana J. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 41-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), most likely through activation of the PPARα-RXR heterodimer (18.Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Noonan D.J. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar). In adipose cell lines, which are highly insulin-sensitive,FATP-1 and ACS expression are also co-regulated by rexinoids in a dose-dependent manner, although the maximum level of induction appears lower. In contrast to the liver cells, which mainly express PPARα, PPARγ is the predominant PPAR isotype expressed in adipocytes and PPARγ activators have been shown to induce both FATP-1 and ACS expression (27.Martin G. Schoonjans K. Lefebvre A. Staels B. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28210-28217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Hence, the induction of FATP-1 (and to a lesser extentACS) expression in adipose cell lines by RXR agonists, suggest that RXR is also here an active partner in the PPARγ-RXR heterodimer. In Caco2, FATP-1 and ACS genes are also co-regulated by rexinoids. This is the first time thatFATP-1 is shown to be expressed in a human intestinal cell line. In view of the co-regulation by retinoic acids of several fatty acid transporters, such as l-FABP (28.Poirier H. Braissant O, N., I. Wahli W. Besnard P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 480-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), ACS andFATP-1, in this tissue, a potential important role for retinoic acid in absorptive processes in the gut is suggested. It furthermore underscores the potential implication of FATP-1, in addition to FATP-4 in fatty acid uptake in the gut (31.Stahl A. Hirsch D.J. Gimeno R.E. Punreddy S. Ge P. Watson N. Patel S. Kotler M. Raimondi A. Tartaglia L.A. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the strong regulatory effects of retinoids onFATP-1 and ACS expression in the liver-derived cell lines (FAO and HepG2; Fig. 1) seems to be translated in vivo (Fig. 7), underscoring the physiological relevance of these findings. In contrast, the apparent difference between the regulation of FATP-1 and ACS gene expression between ourin vitro studies in adipocyte cell lines and our in vivo studies in adipose tissue seems puzzling. Whereas we observe a ±4-fold induction of the expression of both genes in adipocyte cell lines, a much smaller effect was observed in vivo in ZDF adipose tissue, suggesting that the in vivo response in ZDF adipose tissue is somehow impeded. This could be linked to differences either in the expression or activity of one of the heterodimer components (RXR/PPAR) or of one of the cofactors required for transcriptional activity. Further studies in our laboratory are addressing this issue at present. Our studies with more selective ligands confirm the importance of the RXR-PPAR heterodimer in mediating the effects of PPAR and/or RXR agonists on gene expression. Because LG100754 induces only the activity of the RXR-RAR and RXR-PPAR heterodimers, the up-regulation ofFATP-1 and ACS by LG100754 implicates one or the other heterodimer in mediating the effects. LG100268, which is specific for the RXR homodimer or RXR-LXR and RXR-PPAR heterodimers, but not RAR-RXR heterodimers, activates FATP-1 expression. Finally, TTNPB, which is an activator of RAR in the context of RXR-RAR heterodimer, has no effect on FATP-1 and ACS. The combined results of studies using these synthetic retinoids implicates the PPAR-RXR heterodimer as the molecular target of the regulation ofFATP-1 and ACS by retinoic acids. Because PPAR and RXR are both active components of this heterodimer and because we have previously demonstrated that the FATP-1 andACS genes are both regulated by PPAR activators (27.Martin G. Schoonjans K. Lefebvre A. Staels B. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28210-28217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), it appears that rexinoids cooperate synergistically with PPAR ligands to control the expression of these two genes involved in fatty acid metabolism. Furthermore, the fact that the co-regulation ofFATP-1 and ACS genes by rexinoids depends on the differentiated state of 3T3-L1 cells points to the importance of PPARγ in this process. In preadipocyte cells, PPARγ is expressed at low levels and its expression increases upon adipocyte differentiation. The absence of a rexinoid response in undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells, expressing almost no PPARγ, hence also suggests that PPARγ is an obligatory partner of RXR in the retinoid-dependent regulation of FATP-1 and ACS genes in adipose tissue. It is interesting to note that RXR agonists such as LG100268 and LGD1069 function as insulin sensitizers in a similar way as PPARγ agonists (14.Mukherjee R. Davies P.A.J. Crombie D.L. Bischoff E.D. Cesario R.M. Jow L. Hamann L.G. Boehm M.F. Mondon C.E. Nadzan A.M. Paterniti J.R. Heyman R.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Glucose homeostasis is improved when fatty acid concentration decreases in the circulation and more particularly in muscle tissue. The beneficial effect of PPARγ activators on glucose homeostasis has been previously shown to be in part due to a redistribution of fatty acids toward adipose tissue with a relative depletion of fatty acids in the muscle (reviewed in Ref. 17.Martin G. Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 11: 35-47Google Scholar). As known since Randle's work (32.Randle P.J. Garland P.B. Hales C.N. Newsholme E.A. Lancet. 1963; I: 785-789Abstract Scopus (3795) Google Scholar, 33.Randle P.J. Newsholme E.A. Garland P.B. Biochem. J. 1964; 93: 652-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 34.Boden G. Chen X. Ruiz J. White J.V. Rossetti L. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2438-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar), depletion of muscle fatty acid content will result in an improvement of glucose homeostasis. Hence, it is tempting to speculate that the improvements of glucose homeostasis observed with rexinoids are, similar to the effects of PPARγ agonists, linked to an altered partitioning of fatty acids, with a relative depletion of muscle fatty acid uptake and metabolism. As observed in vivo in this study, the attenuated regulation ofFATP-1 and ACS expression in both heart and skeletal muscle is in fact suggestive of a role for these two genes in reducing fatty acid uptake in muscle tissue, which could contribute to the insulin-sensitizing effects of these rexinoids. In view of the distinct tissue distribution of PPARγ and the various RXRs, RXR ligands might have a different tissue-specific activity, affecting mainly the liver, whereas PPARγ activators will affect mainly adipose tissue. RXR agonists could, hence, provide an alternative or complimentary way to regulate the expression of genes implicated in fatty acid distribution and that ultimately affect glucose homeostasis. This study further underscores distinct metabolic effects of retinoidsversus rexinoids and demonstrates that RXR is an important signaling molecule in the regulation of two genes implicated in fatty acid metabolism. Combined with our previous studies on the effects of PPAR agonists on FATP-1 and ACS expression, the data obtained with dimer-specific rexinoids in this manuscript suggest that the PPAR-RXR complex is the molecular target by which rexinoids regulate FATP-1 and ACS gene expression. The observation, that both rexinoids and PPAR agonists control the transcription of the same genes implicated in lipid metabolism, suggests that rexinoids also act as hypolipidemic and hypoglycemic agents through activation of PPAR-RXR complex and are consistent with the hypothesis that the PPAR-RXR heterodimer is a molecular target for insulin sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W1995080475,"Mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ (pol γ) is active in base excision repair of AP (apurinic/apyrimidinic) sites in DNA. Usually AP site repair involves cleavage on the 5′ side of the deoxyribose phosphate by AP endonuclease. Previous experiments suggested that DNA pol γ acts to catalyze the removal of a 5′-deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) group in addition to playing the conventional role of a DNA polymerase. We confirm that DNA pol γ is an active dRP lyase and show that other members of the family A of DNA polymerases including Escherichia coli DNA pol I also possess this activity. The dRP lyase reaction proceeds by formation of a covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate that is converted to an enzyme-dRP intermediate following elimination of the DNA. Both intermediates can be cross-linked with NaBH4. For both DNA pol γ and the Klenow fragment of pol I, the enzyme-dRP intermediate is extremely stable. This limits the overall catalytic rate of the dRP lyase, so that family A DNA polymerases, unlike pol β, may only be able to act as dRP lyases in repair of AP sites when they occur at low frequency in DNA.

If AP sites are not repaired quickly, DNA polymerases are capable of replicating through these non-instructional lesions, resulting in frequent misincorporation. Cells have adapted vigorous mechanisms for the repair of AP sites, usually beginning with incision of the phosphodiester backbone on the 5′ side of the lesion by AP endonuclease to produce a 3′-OH terminus adjacent to a 5′-deoxyribose phosphate, or 5′-dRP group (3.Barzilay G. Hickson I.D. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 4.Demple B. Herman T. Chen D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11450-11454Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). The 3′-OH terminus provides a primer for repair synthesis by DNA polymerase. The 5′-dRP moiety must be removed in the course of repair. This is frequently accomplished by a β-elimination reaction catalyzed by an AP lyase activity. When an AP lyase acts on an exposed 5′-dRP residue produced by a class II AP endonuclease, the activity may be considered as a dRP lyase. The dRP lyase mechanism involves nucleophilic attack on the C-1 position of the 5′-dRP group by a free amino group of the enzyme (5.Dodson M.L. Michaels M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32709-32712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This produces a transient covalent intermediate in which the DNA substrate is linked to the enzyme as a Schiff base that can be stabilized by treatment with strong reducing agents, such as sodium borohydride. This borohydride trapping reaction has been used to identify a number of DNA repair enzymes with AP lyase activity, including several DNA glycosylases (6.Tchou J. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11671-11677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar,7.Nash H.M. Bruner S.D. Scharer O.D. Kawate T. Addona T.A. Spooner E. Lane W.S. Verdine G.L. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 968-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic cells have redundant pathways for repairing AP sites in nuclear DNA. Under most circumstances, AP sites are repaired by a pathway that employs the dedicated repair polymerase, DNA pol β. Recently, Matsumoto and Kim (8.Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) showed that the pol β is especially well adapted to function in base excision repair, since it contains a dRP lyase activity in a small domain not required for polymerase activity. The active site of the pol β dRP lyase has been localized to a helix-hairpin-helix domain similar to that found in repair glycosylases with associated AP lyase activity (7.Nash H.M. Bruner S.D.

Thus, pol β is capable of binding to an incised AP site and employing its polymerase and dRP lyase activities in concerted reactions to prepare the DNA for ligation to complete the repair reaction. This mechanism permits repair to be accomplished with a single base patch size. However, in some instances, pol β may participate in longer patch repair (11.Dianov G.L. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13741-13743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The generation of cell lines devoid of pol β activity implies that pol β is not absolutely indispensable for base excision repair (12.Sobol R.W. Horton J.L. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Our laboratory and others have shown that another polymerase, either pol δ or ε, can function in a repair pathway that employs PCNA and the 5′ flap endonuclease, FEN I (13.Frosina G. Fortinin P.

We recently attempted to characterize enzymes capable of acting in base excision repair of lesions in mtDNA. We reconstituted a complete pathway for repair of AP sites using highly purified mitochondrial enzymes (17.Pinz K. Bogenhagen D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In the course of these experiments, we found that both mtDNA pol γ and mtDNA ligase were active in a borohydride trapping assay. This represented the first observation of potential dRP lyase activity in a DNA polymerase other than DNA pol β, and the first observation of an AP lyase activity in a DNA ligase. We found that other ATP-dependent DNA ligases, including T4 and T7 DNA ligases, also contain AP lyase activity (18.Bogenhagen D.F. Pinz K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7888-7893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this paper, we present additional experiments to characterize the dRP lyase activity in DNA pol γ in greater detail. Since pol γ is a member of the family A group of DNA polymerases (22.Ito J. Braithwaite D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6716Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 23.Ye F. Carrodeguas J.A. Bogenhagen D.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1481-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we also tested other members of this family for dRP lyase activity. All family members tested, including DNA pol I, T7 DNA polymerase, and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase are active in borohydride trapping reactions at dRP sites. The family A DNA polymerases appear to initiate attack at dRP sites quickly, but are slow to complete the β-elimination of the DNA from the dRP group, leading to a very low turnover rate for the overall reaction. We show that the AP lyase activity in DNA pol γ and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I is sufficient to permit these enzymes to function in base excision repair in the absence of other detectable sources of AP lyase activity. All chemicals used were reagent grade. Nucleoside triphosphates were obtained as HPLC purified reagents from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Radioactively labeled nucleotides were obtained from ICN Radiochemicals. Micrococcal nuclease was obtained from Cooper Biochemicals. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and polynucleotide kinase were from New England Biolabs. Uracil DNA glycosylase, HK-UNG, was from Epicentre Technologies. Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (MMLV RT) was obtained from Life Technologies. DNA pol I and the Klenow fragment were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. T7 DNA polymerase was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Escherichia coli endonuclease IV was obtained from Trevigen. E. coli DNA ligase preparations, from Life Technologies, New England Biolabs, and Roche Biochemicals, were screened for dRP lyase activity. None of these preparations were active in borohydride trapping. The preparation from Roche Molecular Biochemicals was selected for repair assays. DNA pol γ was purified from an Xenopus laevis ovary homogenate as described (19.Mikhailov V.S. Bogenhagen D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18939-18946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar,20.Insdorf N.F. Bogenhagen D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21491-21497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The preparation used in this study had a specific activity of 30 units/ml where 1 unit corresponds to incorporation of 1 nmol of TMP on a poly(dA)-oligo(dT) template-primer in 60 min at 30 °C. Mitochondrial APE was prepared as described (17.Pinz K. Bogenhagen D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Recombinant E. coli FPG protein (also known as formamidopyrimidine glycosylase or as 8-oxo-guanine glycosylase) was a gift from Drs. J. Tchou and A. P. Grollman. Recombinant rat DNA pol β was a gift from Dr. Y. Matsumoto (Fox Chase Cancer Center). All commercial DNA polymerases used in this study were analyzed by SDS-PAGE in parallel with quantitative protein standards of similar molecular weight. Densitometric analysis of the Coomassie Blue-stained gel was used to determine the approximate protein concentration. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on a Beckman oligonucleotide synthesizer or were obtained from Operon Technologies. All oligonucleotides were purified by preparative gel electrophoresis. Duplex oligonucleotides were prepared by heating to 70 °C in a solution containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.1 mm EDTA and either 0.1 or 0.2 m NaCl and slowly cooling to room temperature over at least 3 h. The oligonucleotide substrate used for borohydride trapping reactions was prepared by annealing a 15-mer (5′-CATGGGCCGACATGA) and a 5′32P-labeled 17-mer (5′-UCAAGCTTGAGGCCAAG) to a complementary 33-mer (5′-TCTTGGCCTCAAGCTTGATCATGTCGGCCCATG). All experiments involving abasic sites were performed in 40 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5. Where necessary, oligonucleotides containing U residues were pretreated with 0.1 unit of HK-UNG per 10 pmol of oligonucleotide for 30 min at 37 °C to generate 5′-dRP sites immediately before addition of oligonucleotides to DNA pol binding reactions. DNA polymerases were incubated with oligonucleotides containing dRP sites for 20 min at 25 °C prior to addition of NaBH4 at a final concentration of 20 mm (except as noted). The reaction with NaBH4 was continued for 10 min at 25 °C. When reactions were to be treated with micrococcal nuclease, the solution was adjusted to contain a final concentration of 6 mm CaCl2and 20 μg/ml micrococcal nuclease. The nuclease reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min and stopped by addition of an equal volume of SDS gel sample loading buffer. Proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and fractionated by electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide SDS gels using the discontinuous Tris glycine buffer system (21.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Label transferred to protein was detected by autoradiography or PhosphorImager analysis. dRP lyase assays were conducted using a partially duplex DNA substrate consisting of the 5′-labeled 17-mer with a 5′-U residue annealed to the 33-mer as described above. The duplex was treated with UDG prior to incubation with DNA pol or FPG protein or without additional enzymes in 50-μl reactions containing 50 mm sodium thioglycolate and 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C, or for other time intervals as noted, and stopped by addition of one-tenth volume of 3 m sodium acetate, 10 μg of glycogen carrier, and 2.5 volumes of ethanol and incubation at −70 °C for 1 h. The 5′-deoxyribose phosphate thioglycolate product released by dRP lyase was recovered in the supernatant following centrifugation. An aliquot of the ethanol supernatant was diluted with 10 mm Tris, pH 8, and analyzed by HPLC on a 4.6 × 50-mm Poros Q anion exchange column developed with a 10-ml gradient of 0–350 mm NaCl, followed by step elution with 1m NaCl to remove intact oligonucleotide. Covalently closed circular DNA substrates with a labeled residue upstream from a single U residue were prepared and used in site-specific repair assays as described (15.Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 17.Pinz K. Bogenhagen D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Repair reactions were performed with 200 fmol of UDG-treated plasmid DNA in 40-μl reactions in a buffer containing 80 mm NaCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 25 μM ZnOAc, 20 mmTris, pH 8.0, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 mm ATP, 20 μm (each) of four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Where indicated, repair reactions included 1 μl of mitochondrial APE (17.Pinz K. Bogenhagen D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) or 1 unit of endonuclease IV, 0.1 unit of DNA pol γ, or 0.2 unit of Klenow pol and 0.4 unit of E. coli DNA ligase. 50 μm NAD was substituted for ATP in reactions containingE. coli DNA ligase. We tested the abilities of a variety of family A DNA polymerases to react with an oligonucleotide substrate containing a 5′-32P-labeled dRP residue at an internal nick. This oligonucleotide substrate was prepared immediately before incubation with DNA polymerase by treatment of an oligonucleotide containing a single uracil residue with uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG). The resulting oligonucleotide contains an internal 5′-[32P]dRP residue in a structure identical to that expected following incision of an AP site by a class II AP endonuclease. Fig. 1 shows that DNA pol γ, DNA pol I, the pol I Klenow fragment, MMLV RT, T7 DNA polymerase, and DNA pol β are active in the borohydride trapping assay. In each case, the primary trapped product (odd numbered lanes) has a slower gel mobility than the unmodified polymerase due to cross-linking to the oligonucleotide. Treatment with micrococcal nuclease generates a product with essentially the same mobility as the unmodified polymerase (even numbered lanes). DNA pol β represents a positive control for these reactions, since this enzyme is known to contain dRP lyase activity. The additional mass of the oligonucleotide makes a larger contribution to the mobility of a small polymerase like pol β than to the larger polymerases. We have repeatedly seen that cross-linking the MMLV RT preparation gives a doublet of retarded protein bands. We have not explored the basis for this different pattern of reactivity. We conclude that all of the polymerases used in the experiment in Fig. 1are capable of reacting with 5′-dRP residues in DNA to form a Schiff base that can be reduced with NaBH4. To study the kinetics and mechanism of the dRP lyase reaction in greater detail, we selected pol γ and Klenow pol for additional experiments to compare the kinetics of borohydride cross-linking with these enzymes to that observed for pol β as a positive control. We sought to determine whether the yield of cross-linked product would be improved if the DNA polymerase were preincubated with the oligonucleotide for varied intervals before addition of NaBH4. The timing of borohydride-trapping reactions with AP sites is of critical importance since NaBH4 can also reduce the 5′-dRP substrate, effectively preventing further reaction with an dRP lyase. The kinetics of the borohydride trapping reactions are shown in Fig. 2. All three DNA polymerases initiated an attack on the substrate within 5 min. At the earliest time points, two radioactive cross-linked products were observed, a lower band with the same mobility as the unmodified protein and an upper band with the mobility of the enzyme-oligonucleotide complex. At later times, the intensity of the upper band diminished while the intensity of the lower band increased. This behavior is consistent with the proposed reaction scheme shown in Fig. 3, which suggests that the dRP lyase reaction proceeds from an enzyme-DNA to an enzyme-dRP complex. NaBH4 is capable of reducing both intermediates to trap the label on the protein. It is important to recognize that, unlike the experiment in Fig. 1, micrococcal nuclease was not employed in the experiment in Fig. 2. Thus, the conversion from the species with lower mobility to that of higher mobility represents the natural course of the reaction. For pol β, which has a very active dRP lyase, it was necessary to perform the reaction at a reduced temperature to document the upper band species, the presumed protein-oligonucleotide complex. Preincubation of pol β with the substrate at 37 °C resulted in a loss of borohydride-trapped product after the first 30 min. This is predicted for an enzyme with a potent dRP lyase activity that efficiently resolves the dRP-enzyme intermediate. The lack of labeling at later times reflects the fact that pol β has consumed all of the substrate. Pol γ and Klenow pol clearly have a much lower overall turnover rate. Both enzymes facilitate β-elimination of the DNA from the enzyme-oligonucleotide complex, leading to loss of the upper band in the cross-linking reaction. The persistence of the lower band implies that these enzymes do not release the dRP product as efficiently as does pol β.Figure 3Proposed scheme for the dRP lyase reaction. The initial substrate contains a 15-mer and a 5′-end labeled 17-mer annealed to a complementary strand. Treatment with UDG generates a labeled 5′-dRP group adjacent to a nick, as would result from action of AP endonuclease. Binding of DNA pol (enzyme) permits attack on the C1′ residue of the dRP group as shown. This overall scheme is adapted from Sun et al. (10.Sun B. Latham K.A. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19501-19508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and Zharkov et al. (30.Zharkov D.O. Rieger R.A. Iden C.R. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5335-5341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The β-elimination reaction involves the primary attack to form the Schiff base intermediate and also abstraction of a proton by a second nucleophilic center in the enzyme (:enz) to promote elimination of the DNA. Both enzyme-DNA and enzyme-dRP intermediates are capable of reaction with NaBH4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We performed a more detailed analysis of the kinetics of the dRP lyase mechanism in an additional experiment in which we monitored the disappearance of the substrate oligonucleotide, the appearance of the borohydride-trapped polymerase intermediates and the generation of an ethanol-soluble product. The results in Fig.4 document the disappearance of the free labeled oligonucleotide substrate concomitant with the appearance of the labeled enzyme-DNA and later of the enzyme-dRP intermediates. Free [32P]dRP is released slowly as the final product of the reaction. A similar reaction rate was observed with pol γ (data not shown). In experiments performed with DNA pol β we have observed the same sequence of events, but at an accelerated pace (Fig.5; note the change in time scale compared with Fig. 4). In reactions in which 400 fmol of oligonucleotide was incubated with either 100 or 1000 fmol of DNA pol β, release of soluble dRP product is essentially complete in 10 min. Interestingly, the enzyme-DNA intermediate is more easily visualized by borohydride trapping in reactions containing a higher relative concentration of oligonucleotide substrate (panel B) than in those containing excess pol β (panel C). The persistence of the enzyme-DNA intermediate is apparent due to the use of substrate-excess conditions. A major difference between the dRP lyase reaction catalyzed by pol β and that of Klenow pol is that the release of the dRP residue from the enzyme is a very slow rate-limiting step for Klenow pol.Figure 5Time course of substrate utilization, formation of intermediates identifiable by borohydride trapping, and product release for the dRP lyase reaction of pol β. 400 fmol of the oligonucleotide depicted in Fig. 3 was treated with UDG to generate the abasic site substrate. The 5′-[32P]dRP oligonucleotide was incubated with either 1 pmol or 100 fmol of pol β for varied periods of time before addition of NaBH4. Samples were processed as in Fig. 4. Panel A shows the utilization of the oligonucleotide substrate in reactions with 1 pmol (♦) or 100 fmol (▪) of pol β. Panel B shows a PhosphorImager analysis of an SDS-PAGE gel of pol β reacted with the 5′-[32P]dRP oligonucleotide under conditions with excess oligonucleotide (100 fmol of pol β reaction).Panel C shows a PhosphorImager image of an SDS-PAGE gel of pol β reacted with the 5′-dRP oligonucleotide under conditions with excess pol β (1 pmol pol β reaction). The two radioactive species in panels B and C are identified as enzyme-DNA (E-DNA) and enzyme-dRP (E-dRP). Panel D shows the percentage of input label that was solubilized as a function of time of incubation with either 1000 (♦) or 100 (▪) fmol pol β.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We performed additional experiments with pol γ and Klenow pol to characterize the ethanol soluble product of the reaction. When the dRP lyase reaction is conducted in the presence of thioglycolate, an anionic species is generated that has characteristic chromatographic properties on anion exchange HPLC (8.Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 24.Graves R.J. Felzenszwalb I. Laval J. O'Connor T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14429-14435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.6 shows that the ethanol soluble products generated by DNA pol γ and Klenow pol in the presence of thioglycolate have the same chromatographic properties as the species produced by a well characterized AP lyase, E. coli FPG protein. We conclude that both of these enzymes are capable of acting as authentic dRP lyase enzymes to catalyze release of a 5′ dRP residue at an incised AP site. However, additional experiments revealed that the overall rate of catalysis by these DNA polymerases is quite limited. Despite extensive efforts to determine a turnover rate for the AP lyase in Klenow pol we have not been able to document a release of more than 0.7 dRP group per enzyme molecule in reactions incubated for as long as 1 h. The experiments presented above show that our preliminary report of borohydride trapping activity in pol γ (17.Pinz K. Bogenhagen D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and the related activity in Klenow pol do represent authentic dRP lyase activity. Our earlier experiments did not permit the conclusion that the dRP lyase activity in pol γ was sufficient for repair in the absence of other sources of dRP lyase since we observed that the mtDNA ligase was also a potential source of AP lyase activity. We performed repair experiments to test whether the dRP lyase activity in DNA pol γ or Klenow pol is sufficient for repair in reactions in which all other enzymes employed in the repair reaction lack AP lyase activity. Control experiments with the uracil glycosylase, mtAPE, endonuclease IV, and E. coli DNA ligase used in these repair reactions failed to show any indication of dRP lyase activity as assessed by borohydride trapping or dRP release assays (data not shown). In the repair experiments in Fig. 7, we used a closed circular DNA substrate containing a single U residue. The substrate was prelabeled with 32P at a single site 5 base pairs preceding the lesion to permit us to follow the course of the repair reaction. One labeled substrate was used for two separate sets of reactions using different sources of DNA polymerase and AP endonuclease. In reaction A, the template was incised using mitochondrial APE and repaired using DNA pol γ. In reaction B, the template was incised using E. coli endonuclease IV and repaired using the Klenow fragment of DNA pol I. In each case, the complete repair reactions included E. coli DNA ligase. The intermediate and final products were cleaved at HinfI sites flanking the lesion to permit a detailed analysis of the intermediates and products of the repair reaction following electrophoresis of the fragments on a 20% PAGE-urea gel. The gel analysis of the treated samples is shown in Fig. 7. The substrate was efficiently incised by either mitochondrial APE (lane A2) or E. coliendonuclease IV (lane B6). The incised DNAs were then incubated either with E. coli DNA ligase alone (lanes A3 and B7), with polymerase alone (DNA pol γ inlane A4, Klenow pol in lane B8), or with bothE. coli DNA ligase and the appropriate polymerase (lanes A5 and B9). Complete repair was observed in reactions including AP endonuclease, either pol γ or Klenow pol, and E. coli DNA ligase. We conclude that both pol γ and Klenow pol can participate in repair reactions in which they provide the only detectable source of dRP lyase. We initially reported that DNA pol γ was active in a borohydride trapping reaction as a preliminary observation in a study of the overall base excision repair reaction conducted by mitochondrial proteins (17.Pinz K. Bogenhagen D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Subsequent to this, Longley et al. (25.Longley M. Prasad R. Srivastava D. Wilson S. Copeland W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12244-12248Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) published a more thorough characterization of the dRP lyase reaction of recombinant human DNA pol γ. The dRP lyase assay employed by Longleyet al. (25.Longley M. Prasad R. Srivastava D. Wilson S. Copeland W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12244-12248Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) monitored the shift in mobility of a 3′-labeled oligonucleotide upon release of the 5′-dRP group. Our current work provides the first evidence that a DNA pol γ liberates a product in the presence of thioglycolic acid with the chromatographic properties characteristic of a dRP release product (Fig. 6). Longley et al. (25.Longley M. Prasad R. Srivastava D. Wilson S. Copeland W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12244-12248Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) concluded that the rate of the overall dRP lyase reaction was markedly slower for pol γ than for pol β. Our current work suggests that the rate-limiting step in this reaction is the slow release of the dRP group from the enzyme. Since DNA pol γ shares significant sequence homology with other members of the family A DNA polymerases, we asked whether other enzymes in this class contained a similar dRP lyase activity. The experiment in Fig. 1 shows that three other family A DNA polymerases were readily labeled by borohydride trapping reactions with the appropriate AP site substrate. We selected the Klenow fragment of DNA pol I for more extensive studies and found that this enzyme, like pol γ, has a very low catalytic rate limited by slow release of the dRP group from the enzyme. We note that there is at least one precedent in the case ofE. coli mutY protein for a bona fide AP lyase that exhibits a very slow release of the dRP product (26.Zharkov D. Grollman A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12384-12394Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A recurrent issue in the literature on AP lyase activities is the concern that the β-elimination of a 5′-dRP group is a facile reaction that occurs at a measurable rate in the absence of enzymes. Moreover, release can be accelerated by binding of nonspecific basic proteins and even by simple peptides or by elevated pH. One standard that is applied to ask whether an AP lyase activity is authentic is to determine whether it depends on native enzyme structure. We found that both DNA pol γ and Klenow pol are inactive in borohydride trapping assays following thermal denaturation (data not shown). Nevertheless, it may be argued that the rather languid lyase reaction of family A DNA polymerases indicates that this is not an important activity. However, it is clear that DNA polymerases bind nicked AP sites avidly and initiate attack on the C1′ residue of the dRP group rapidly. Once the reaction has been initiated in this manner, it is only the subsequent mechanistic step of product release that is kinetically slow. This slow overall reaction indicates that family A DNA polymerases would be unlikely to handle a large load of AP site damage successfully without the aid of other sources of AP lyase activity. For wild type E. coli, the catalytic inefficiency of the polymerase-associated dRP lyase may be of little consequence, since this organism contains themutM gene product as an alternative source of AP lyase. The polymerase-associated dRP lyase may be a factor in the survival ofE. coli bearing mutM and recJmutations (27.Dianov G. Sedgwick B. Daly G. Olsson M. Lovett S. Lindahl T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It is possible that mitochondria contain additional sources of AP lyase activity that may contribute to efficient repair of AP sites in vivo or in crude extracts (28.Stierum R. Dianov G. Bohr V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3712-3719Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Our observation that E. coli DNA pol I has an associated dRP lyase activity may appear to be at odds with the classical work of Mosbaugh and Linn (29.Mosbaugh D.W. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 575-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on the mechanism of action of E. coliDNA pol I at incised AP sites in DNA. These workers found that DNA pol I did not appear to act efficiently at incised AP sites generated by random depurination of PM2 DNA. This early work did not involve studies of site-specific lesions. Since the lyase mechanism for removal of dRP groups was not appreciated at the time this work was done, these authors were more concerned with the question of whether the 5′-3′ exonuclease of DNA pol I would remove a 5′-dRP group. They concluded that the exonuclease activity was not able to act on the 5′-dRP group at an incised AP site, and that the polymerase was able to engage in strand displacement replication on these templates. Our results suggest that the dRP lyase activity in DNA pol I may permit the enzyme to remove a limited number of 5′-dRP residues and that the strand displacement reported by Mosbaugh and Linn (29.Mosbaugh D.W. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 575-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) may be increasingly common on templates with a high frequency of AP sites. Thus, the alternate sources of AP lyase in E. coli mentioned above clearly have an important role to limit the number of instances in which pol I is required to act as a dRP lyase. We thank Drs. Francis Johnson and Dmitry Zharkov for valuable discussions and Dr. Holly Miller for comments on the manuscript."

C3G, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rap1 and R-Ras, is postulated to transduce the oncogenic signal of v-Crk to c-Jun kinase (JNK). We have found that R-Ras, but not Rap1, mediates JNK activation by v-Crk in 293T and NIH 3T3 cells. Constitutively activated R-Ras, R-RasVal-38, but not Rap1Val-12, activated JNK, as did the constitutively active H-RasVal-12 or Rac1Val-12. v-Crk activation of JNK was inhibited by a dominant-negative mutant of R-Ras, R-RasAsn-43. JNK activation by R-RasVal-38 was inhibited by a dominant-negative mutant of mixed lineage kinase 3. Among six GEFs for Ras-family G proteins, mSos1, Ras-GRF, C3G, CalDAG-GEFI, Ras-GRP/CalDAG-GEFII, and Epac/cAMP-GEFI, GEFs for either H-Ras or R-Ras activated JNK and c-Jun-dependent transcription. CalDAG-GEFI and Epac/cAMP-GEFI, both of which are GEFs specific for Rap1, did not activate JNK or c-Jun-dependent transcription. These results demonstrate that R-Ras, but not Rap1, is the downstream effector of C3G to stimulate JNK. Finally, we found that expression of the dominant-negative R-Ras mutant induced flat reversion of NIH 3T3 cells transformed by v-Crk, suggesting that R-Ras-dependent JNK activation is critical for the transformation by v-Crk. v-crk is an oncogene identified originally in CT10 chicken tumor virus.

Src homology guanine nucleotide exchange factor c-Jun kinase glutathione S-transferase phosphoinositide 3-kinase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis mixed lineage kinase v-Crk was isolated originally as an oncogene product of CT10 chicken tumor virus and consisted mostly of the SH21 and SH3 domains (1.Mayer B.J. Hamaguchi M. Hanafusa H. Nature. 1988; 332: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Cells infected by CT10 accumulate several phosphotyrosine-containing proteins that bind to the SH2 domain of v-Crk and serve as plasma membrane anchors for v-Crk (2.Kiyokawa E. Mochizuki N. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1997; 8: 329-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The SH3 domain of v-Crk and its cellular homologs, CrkI and CrkII, bind to several proteins that have proline-rich sequences (2.Kiyokawa E. Mochizuki N. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1997; 8: 329-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Among them, C3G, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rap1 and R-Ras (3.Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Takenawa T. Matuoka K. Shibuya M. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mochizuki N. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1997; 8: 329-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Transformation of NIH 3T3 cells by v-Crk is enhanced by the overexpression of C3G and inhibited by a catalytically inactive C3G mutant (4.Tanaka S. Ouchi T. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2356-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). C3G activates c-Jun kinase (JNK), as does v-Crk. The dominant-negative mutant of Sek1, a direct upstream activator of JNK, also inhibits transformation of NIH 3T3 cells by v-Crk, indicating that JNK activation is, at least, required for the transformation by v-Crk (4.Tanaka S. Ouchi T. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2356-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). C3G promotes the guanine nucleotide exchange reaction of Rap1 and R-Ras (5.Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T.

There are two Rap1 proteins, Rap1A and Rap1B, in mammalian cells; however, no functional difference has been known (7.Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Rap1, which shares 55% identity in the amino acid sequence with H-Ras, was isolated as a suppressor of Ras in NIH 3T3 cells and was subsequently shown to compete with Ras in Raf activation (7.Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Rap1 has been shown to transform Swiss 3T3 cells, suggesting that the effect of Rap1 on oncogenesis may change drastically in a cellular milieu (8.Altschuler D.L. Ribeiro-Neto F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7475-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). cDNA of R-Ras, another member of Ras family GTPase, was isolated by low-stringency hybridization with a v-H-ras probe (9.Lowe D.G.

Constitutively active R-Ras does not induce morphological transformation of NIH 3T3 cells (10.Huff S.Y. Quilliam L.A. Cox A.D. Der C.J.

Biol. 1997; 7: 63-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, R-Ras seems to transform cells in a pathway distinct from the Raf-ERK/MAPK pathway. In this study, we have examined whether Rap1 or R-Ras plays the principal role in the activation of JNK by C3G. Wild-type and dominant-negative mutant of Rap1A, pSRα-Krev-1–17N, were obtained from M. Noda at Kyoto University (16.Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). The wild-type, constitutively active, and dominant-negative mutants of R-Ras, pEXV-R-Ras, pEXV-R-RasV38, and pEXV-R-RasN43, respectively, were obtained from A. Hall (17.Rey I. Taylorharris P.

Coding regions of these Ras family GTPases were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into pCXN2-Flag and pCAGGS-Hyg (18.Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4617) Google Scholar). pEBG-JNK and pGEX-c-Jun were obtained from B. J. Mayer (19.Tanaka M. Lu W. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Gutkind (4.Tanaka S. Ouchi T. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2356-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Rabbit antisera against C3G and GST were developed in our laboratory (3.Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Takenawa T. Matuoka K. Shibuya M. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M.

Anti-FLAG M5 monoclonal antibody and anti-Crk monoclonal antibody were purchased from Sigma and Transduction Laboratories, respectively. Anti-RasGRF, anti-mSos1, and anti-MLK3 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotech. 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui, Tokyo) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and transfected by the calcium phosphate method. NIH 3T3 and COS1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and transfected by FuGene6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (150 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin) and cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 15 min. Aliquots of the total cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. From the remaining lysates, GST-JNK was collected on glutathione-Sepharose and used for in vitro JNK assay. As a positive control, cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml anisomycin (Sigma) for 10 min before cell lysis. JNK kinase activity was measured byin vitro kinase assay with GST-c-Jun (amino acids 1–79) used as substrate (24.Coso O.A. Chiariello R. Kalinec G. Kyriakis J.M. Woodgett J. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5620-5624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). After SDS-PAGE, gels were analyzed by a BAS 1000 image analyzer (Fuji film, Tokyo). Activation of the c-Jun transcriptional factor was assayed by use of a PathDetect kit (Stratagene). 2 × 105 of 293T cells were transfected with 1 μg of pFR-Luc monitor plasmid, 50 ng of pFA2-c-Jun activator plasmid, and 1 μg of expression vectors for GEFs of Ras family GTPases. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were lysed in lysis buffer, and luciferase activity was measured by a LAS 1000 image analyzer (Fuji film). v-Crk-NIH 3T3 cell (clone 1-1) has been described previously (4.Tanaka S. Ouchi T. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2356-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The v-Crk-NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with pCAGGS-Hyg, pCAGGS-Hyg-Flag-R-RasAsn-43, or pCAGGS-Hyg-Flag-H-RasAsn-17 with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 2 days, cells were selected in the presence of hygromycin B (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Ten days later, morphology of the colonies were observed and flat revertants were counted under the microscope as described (16.Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Several representative flat revertants and spindle non-revertants were isolated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. C3G promotes a guanine nucleotide exchange reaction of Rap1 and R-Ras (5.Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 6.Gotoh T. Niino Y. Tokuda M. Hatase O. Nakamura S. Matsuda M. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18602-18607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We first tested whether constitutively active mutants of Rap1 and R-Ras, Rap1Val-12, and R-RasVal-38, respectively, stimulated JNK in 293T, NIH 3T3, and COS cells. As shown in Fig.1, R-RasVal-38, but not Rap1Val-12, activated JNK, as did active H-Ras and Rac in 293T and NIH 3T3 cells. Previously, it was reported that R-Ras did not activate JNK in COS cells (15.Marte B.M. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 63-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In concordance with this observation, we found that H-RasVal-12 or R-RasVal-38 did not significantly activate JNK in COS cells, whereas RacVal-12 did so efficiently. The activation of JNK in 293T cells was observed most prominently by use of the GTPase-deficient active form, R-RasVal-38, and slightly by the wild-type R-Ras. The dominant-negative mutant, R-RasAsn-43, did not stimulate JNK. We next examined whether the dominant-negative mutants of H-Ras, R-Ras, and Rap1 inhibited C3G-dependent activation of JNK. As shown in Fig. 2 A, R-RasAsn-43 partially inhibited the C3G-dependent JNK activation. Neither H-RasAsn-17 nor Rap1Asn-17 inhibited JNK activation by C3G. The inability of Rap1Asn-17 to inhibit JNK activation may partly be due to the low expression level of Rap1Asn-17 and partly due to its inability to interact with C3G (25.van den Berghe N. Cool R.H. Horn G. Wittinghofer A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The incomplete inhibition by R-RasAsn-43 may suggest that C3G has multiple pathways leading to the activation of JNK. Thus, we examined the effect of R-RasAsn-43 on the JNK activation by two C3G active mutants, C3G-CD and C3G-F (Fig.2 B). C3G-CD lacks the amino-terminal negative regulatory region. C3G-F is fused to the CAAX box of K-Ras and activated by membrane translocation. In either case, R-RasAsn-43 inhibited JNK activation, but again, partially. Because C3G-CD consists solely of the catalytic domain, it is unlikely that C3G-CD activated JNK without activation of Rap1 or R-Ras. In addition, C3G-ΔCD, which lacks the catalytic domain, did not activate JNK. 2N. Mochizuki and M. Matsuda, unpublished results. Thus, the incomplete inhibition by R-RasAsn-43 may be ascribable to the overexpression of C3G or to the low affinity of R-RasAsn-43to C3G. We next tested the effect of the dominant-negative mutants of R-Ras and Rac on the v-Crk dependent JNK activation in 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 2 B, v-Crk dependent JNK activation was inhibited by the expression of R-RasAsn-43 mutant. Rac1Asn-17mutant also inhibited v-Crk-dependent JNK activation as reported previously (26.Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kobayashi S. Sugimura H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). C3G-dependent activation of JNK is independent of Ras and dependent on MLK3 (27.Tanaka S. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1281-1284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To confirm that C3G activates JNK via R-Ras, we examined whether R-Ras also requires MLK3 for JNK activation by the use of the dominant-negative MLK3 mutant. As shown in Fig. 2 C, the R-Ras dependent JNK activation was inhibited by the dominant-negative MLK3 (Fig. 2 C), suggesting that C3G-dependent JNK activation is mediated by R-Ras and MLK3. v-Crk requires C3G-dependent JNK activation for the transformation of NIH 3T3 cells (4.Tanaka S. Ouchi T. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2356-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 27.Tanaka S. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1281-1284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether R-Ras is involved in the JNK activation by v-Crk in NIH 3T3 cells. As shown in Fig. 3, JNK activation by v-Crk was inhibited by R-RasAsn-43 and Rac1Asn-17, suggesting that in NIH 3T3 cells both R-Ras and Rac were required for the optimal JNK activation by v-Crk. R-Ras-induced JNK activation was inhibited by the dominant-negative MLK, MLK-KR, in NIH 3T3 cells as we observed in 293T cells. Thus, we concluded that R-Ras was required for the JNK activation by v-Crk in NIH 3T3 cells as in 293T cells. To exclude the involvement of Rap1 from the C3G-dependent activation of JNK, we utilized two guanine nucleotide exchange proteins for Rap1, CalDAG-GEFI and Epac/cAMP-GEFI (21.Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Toki S. Canales J.J. Harlan P. Blumenstiel J.P. Chen E.J. Bany I.A. Mochizuki N. Ashbacher A. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13278-13283Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 22.Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). Both promote a guanine nucleotide exchange reaction of Rap1, but not R-Ras. For comparison, we used three other GEFs for Ras family proteins, RasGRF and RasGRP/CalDAG-GEFII, which activate both Ras and R-Ras, and Sos, which activates only Ras. Neither CalDAG-GEFI nor Epac/cAMP-GEFI activated JNK (Fig. 4, A andB). We further confirmed that GEFs for Rap1 did not activate JNK by measuring the transcriptional activity of c-Jun-GAL4 chimeric protein (Fig. 4 C). Rap1Val-12 and GEFs specific for Rap1, CalDAG-GEFI, and Epac/cAMP-GEFI, did not activate c-Jun-dependent transcription. Other GEFs, C3G, Sos, RasGRF, and Ras-GRP/CalDAG-GEFII, activated c-Jun-dependent transcription, as did R-RasVal-38. This result strongly suggests that R-Ras, but not Rap1, mediated JNK activation by C3G. Both Ras-GRF and Ras-GRP/CalDAG-GEFII activate Ras and R-Ras; therefore, these GEFs appear to have two pathways for activation of JNK. In addition, it is noteworthy that Sos activates Rac by its Dbl-homology domain (28.Nimnual A.S. Yatsula B.A. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar); therefore, Rac-dependent JNK activation may also account for the Sos activation of JNK. Finally, we examined whether the dominant-negative R-Ras mutant, R-RasAsn-43, reverted v-crk-induced transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. Sixteen percent of the stable transfectants of R-RasAsn-43 were flat and scored as revertants (Fig. 5 A). Most of these revertants displayed a peculiar flat polygonal shape with large cytoplasm as shown in Fig. 5 B. From the R-RasAsn-43-transfected colonies, several flat revertants and spindle non-revertants were isolated and subjected to immunoblotting (Fig. 5 C). Cells from flat colonies expressed R-RasAsn-43, whereas spindle cells expressed little or no R-RasAsn-43 mutants. Flat revertants appeared also by transfection of control vector (Fig. 5 A); however, the morphology of these cells were clearly distinguishable from those expressing R-RasAsn-43.2 Previously, Dolfi et al. (29.Dolfi F. Garcia-Guzman M. Ojaniemi M. Nakamura H. Matsuda M. Vuori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15394-15399Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) demonstrated that integrin stimulation activates JNK in a manner dependent on Crk and C3G. C3G is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine upon integrin-mediated cell adhesion (30.de Jong R. van Wijk A. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2805-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and tyrosine phosphorylation of C3G stimulates its catalytic activity (31.Ichiba T. Hashimoto Y. Nakaya M. Kuraishi Y. Tanaka S. Kurata T. Mochizuki N. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14376-14381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In this report, we have shown that R-Ras, but not Rap1, is the downstream effector of C3G for the activation of JNK. In concordance with this finding, there is a resemblance in the effect of Crk and R-Ras on cell migration. Cell migration is enhanced by the expression of Crk (32.Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 33.Nakashima N. Rose D.W. Xiao S. Egawa K. Martin S.S. Haruta T. Saltiel A.R. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3001-3008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) or R-Ras (34.Khwaja A. Lehmann K. Marte B.M. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18793-18801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 35.Keely P.J. Rusyn E.V. Cox A.D. Parise L.V. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1077-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The constitutively active R-Ras increases the ligand-binding affinity of integrin (36.Zhang Z.H. Vuori K. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 37.Ramos J.W. Kojima T.K. Hughes P.E. Fenczik C.A. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33897-33900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar); similarly, expression of CrkL activates cell adhesion of 32D cells (38.Arai A. Nosaka Y. Kohsaka H. Miyasaka N. Miura O. Blood. 1999; 93: 3713-3722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This adhesion of 32D cells was enhanced by the expression of C3G and inhibited by the dominant-negative R-Ras. Altogether, JNK activation by integrin stimulation appears to utilize, at least in part, Crk, C3G, and R-Ras. It should be noted that another Crk-binding protein, DOCK180, also activates JNK via Rac (26.Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kobayashi S. Sugimura H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). A previous report that a catalytically inactive C3G mutant inhibits JNK activation by v-Crk does not rule out the involvement of DOCK180 in Crk-dependent JNK activation, because the dominant-negative C3G mutant used in that study blocked the Crk SH3 domain, to which both C3G and DOCK180 bind (4.Tanaka S. Ouchi T. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2356-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that dominant-negative R-Ras also inhibits v-Crk-dependent JNK activation. Dominant-negative Ras family proteins including R-RasAsn-43 exert their effects by sequestering GEFs (39.Stacey D.W. Feig L.A. Gibbs J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4053-4064Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 40.Powers S. O'Neill K. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 41.Farnsworth C.L. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4822-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar); therefore, this result suggests that a GEF for R-Ras, probably C3G, also activates JNK activation in 293T and NIH 3T3 cells. Because both RacAsn-17 and R-RasAsn-43 mutants inhibited v-Crk-dependent activation of JNK, there seems to be at least two pathways leading to JNK activation from v-Crk. The effect of these dominant-negative mutants were partial in 293T cells and almost complete in NIH 3T3 cells. This observation suggests that, in cells expressing lower amount of v-Crk such as NIH 3T3, cooperation between the C3G-R-Ras pathway and the DOCK180-Rac pathway is required for the optimal JNK activation. Moreover, it has been shown that Crk binds to and activates hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1, which stimulates JNK in a manner dependent on TAK1 and MEKK1 (42.Ling P. Yao Z. Meyer C.F. Wang X.S. Oehrl W. Feller S.M. Tan T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although the expression of hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 is limited to hematopoietic cells, it should be considered that Crk has multiple downstream effector molecules for the activation of JNK in various cells. Currently it is unknown why R-Ras does not activate JNK in COS cells. Similarly to R-Ras, Rho induces activation of JNK in 293T cells but not in COS cells (43.Teramoto H. Crespo P. Coso O.A. Igishi T. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25731-25734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A kinase that functions in a tissue-specific manner is postulated to transduce a signal from Rho to JNK. We showed that MLK3 was required for JNK activation by R-Ras. MLK3 is expressed in most tissues and is required for JNK activation by Rac and Cdc42 in COS cells (44.Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Miyata H. Igishi T. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27225-27228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar); therefore, another protein that connects R-Ras to MLK3 seems to function in a cell type-specific manner. Several proteins including PI 3-kinase, raf, and RalGDS are known to bind to both H-Ras and R-Ras. Among these, PI 3-kinase is a common effector protein between H-Ras and R-Ras (15.Marte B.M. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 63-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We tested whether active PI 3-kinases stimulate JNK in 293T cells by the use of two types of active p110 subunit of PI-3 kinase. 110-CAAX is fused to the CAAX box of H-Ras (15.Marte B.M. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 63-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and pBD-110 is activated by the fusion to p85 subunit. Neither of the mutants activated JNK in 293T cells.2 Thus, PI-3 kinase has been excluded from the candidate protein that activates JNK upon R-Ras activation. As far as we know, the other effector proteins of R-Ras do not active JNK either. We have demonstrated that the dominant-negative R-Ras mutant reverts v-crk-dependent morphological transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. This result strongly suggests that a GEF for R-Ras, probably C3G, is required for the transformation by v-Crk. Because Rap1 does not transform NIH 3T3 cells, R-Ras appears to transduce oncogenic signal of v-Crk in NIH 3T3 cells. However, in Swiss 3T3 cells, expression of active Rap1 induces DNA synthesis (45.Yoshida Y. Kawata M. Miura Y. Musha T. Sasaki A. Kikuchi A. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3407-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and oncogenic transformation (8.Altschuler D.L. Ribeiro-Neto F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7475-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar); therefore, it remains possible that Rap1 also transduces oncogenic signals from v-Crk in a different milieu. In conclusion, we have shown that R-Ras functions downstream to v-Crk and C3G and upstream to MLK for the activation of JNK. This pathway plays a critical role in the transformation of NIH 3T3 cells by the v-Crk oncogene product. We thank S. Hattori, T. Gotoh, K. Kaibuchi, A. Hall, K. Vuori, M. Noda, H. Hanafusa, Y.

https://openalex.org/W1966474085,"We have described previously a novel interferon (IFN)-responsive cis-acting enhancer element called γ-IFN-activated transcriptional element (GATE). GATE is distinct from the known IFN-stimulated elements and binds to novel transacting factors. To identify the γ-IFN-responsive transacting factors that interact with GATE, we have screened a cDNA expression library derived from IFN-γ-stimulated murine macrophage cell line and isolated three different cDNAs. Among these is a gene coding for the pleiotropic transcription factor, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β (C/EBP-β). We report here that the gene for C/EBP-β binds to GATE and induces gene expression. A mutant C/EBP-β interferes with the IFN-γ-stimulated transcription of the ISGF3γ (p48) promoter. Other members of the C/EBP family do not cause these effects. Interestingly, the expression of C/EBP-β, not the other members of its family, is induced by IFN-γ. These studies thus identify a novel role for C/EBP-β in the IFN-signaling pathways.

Ransohoff R.M. Transcriptional Regulation in the Interferon System. Chapman & Hall/Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX1997Google Scholar). IFN effects on the cells are, in part, may also be due to the repression of certain other genes (2.Der S.D. Zhou A. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15623-15628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar). ISG induction has been largely due to activation of the well established Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK)-signal-transducing activators of transcription (STAT) pathway, wherein tyrosine-phosphorylated dual function factors (i.e. STATs) directly regulate the expression of down-stream genes (3.Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3345) Google Scholar, 4.Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3361) Google Scholar). In the IFN-α/β induced response, STAT1 and STAT2, after their activation by JAK1 and TYK2, associate with ISGF3γ (p48 or IRF-9), a member of the IFN-gene regulatory factor (IRF) family (4.Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3361) Google Scholar, 5.Bluyssen A.R. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The resultant multimeric complex, ISGF3, migrates to nucleus prior to its binding to the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) and stimulation of target gene transcription (3.Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3345) Google Scholar, 4.Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev.

In a number of tumor- and viral oncogene-expressing cell lines, down-regulation of the physical levels or inactivation of the components of ISGF3 serves as a mechanism for evading the action of IFNs (6.Wong L.H. Krauer K.G. Hatzinisiriou I. Estcourt M.J. Hersey P. Tam N.D. Edmondson S. Devenish R.J. Ralph S.J. J. Biol.

Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 166-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, ISGF3 is central to the IFN response.Although IFN-α can alone induce ISGs, pretreatment with IFN-γ causes a robust induction of these and consequent biological response (8.Lewis J.A. Huq A. Shan B. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4569-4578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Levy D.E. Lew D.J. Decker T. Kessler D.S. Darnell Jr., J.E.

This latter effect is achieved through an enhancement of the levels of ISGF3γ (9.Levy D.E. Lew D.J. Decker T. Kessler D.S. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1105-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 10.Bandyopadhyay S.K. Kalvakolanu D.V. Sen G.C. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1992; 12: 3315-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). ISGF3γ is an IFN-regulated gene, like certain other members of the IRF family (11.Veals S.A. Schindler C. Leonard D. Fu X.Y. Aebersold R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Levy D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3315-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). However, it is a slowly induced gene and requires new protein synthesis, unlike other IRFs (12.Weihua X. Kolla V. Kalvakolanu D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated earlier that GATE, a novel IFN-γ response element, and its cognate transacting factors regulate the murine p48 promoter (12.Weihua X. Kolla V. Kalvakolanu D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We have now identified the GATE binding factors (GBF) from a cDNA library prepared from an IFN-γ-stimulated macrophage cell line. Here we show that one of the GBFs is transcription factor C/EBP-β, a member of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein family (13.Lekstrom-Himes J. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28545-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). It regulates GATE-dependent gene expression, in an IFN-dependent manner. We also show that C/EBP-β (NF-IL6, LAP, NF-M, IL6-DBP) is an IFN-stimulated gene. This factor has been previously shown to regulate the type I acute phase-responsive genes, under the control of another cytokine, IL-6 (14.Akira S. Kishimoto T. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 1-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Poli V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29279-29282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Our studies for the first time demonstrate a role for C/EBP-β in the IFN signal transduction pathway and uncover a novel mechanism of IFN action.DISCUSSIONImmunoregulatory cytokine IFN-γ is critical for mediating a wide array of biological responses in the vertebrates, including antiviral and antitumor functions (17.Boehm U. Klamp T. Groot M. Howard J.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 749-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (2462) Google Scholar, 18.Kaplan D.H. Shankaran V. Dighe A.S. Stockert E. Aguet M. Old L.J. Schreiber R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7556-7561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). A number of ISGs have been identified using a variety of techniques (1.Sen G.C. Ransohoff R.M. Transcriptional Regulation in the Interferon System. Chapman & Hall/Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX1997Google Scholar, 2.Der S.D. Zhou A. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15623-15628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar). The IFN-γ-stimulated genes are induced with variable kinetics unlike those stimulated by IFN-α/β (1.Sen G.C. Ransohoff R.M. Transcriptional Regulation in the Interferon System. Chapman & Hall/Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX1997Google Scholar). All IFN responses are attributed to the activation of JAK-STAT signaling pathway, a rapidly activated and deactivated process (3.Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3345) Google Scholar, 4.Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3361) Google Scholar). STAT activation often lasts for no longer than 1 h after the ligand engagement with receptor, despite the presence of IFN in the extracellular environment (3.Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3345) Google Scholar, 4.Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3361) Google Scholar). Although the activation of STATs and subsequent expression of certain ISGs is independent of de novo RNA or protein synthesis, several IFN-γ-regulated genes require the synthesis of other protein factors (1.Sen G.C. Ransohoff R.M. Transcriptional Regulation in the Interferon System. Chapman & Hall/Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX1997Google Scholar, 2.Der S.D. Zhou A. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15623-15628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the induction of certain IFN-stimulated genes does not correspond to the STAT activation and deactivation kinetics (1.Sen G.C. Ransohoff R.M. Transcriptional Regulation in the Interferon System. Chapman & Hall/Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX1997Google Scholar, 2.Der S.D. Zhou A. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15623-15628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that transcription factors other than STATs regulate the expression of these “late induced genes.” Indeed a number of factors, such as hXBP1, RF-X, interferon gene regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), class II transactivator, and IFN consensus sequence-binding protein represent the secondary mediators of signals emanated from the initial burst of STAT activation (19.Kamijo R. Harada H. Matsuyama T. Bosland M. Gerecitano J. Shapiro D. Le J. Koh S.I. Kimura T. Green S.J. Mak T.W. Taniguchi T. Vilcek J.

Med. 1994; 180: 1367-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). However, these factors can only partially account for the pleiotropic nature of IFN response, and additional undefined IFN-induced regulators may exist. That said, IRFs also regulate gene expression independent of STAT proteins (20.Briken V. Ruffner H. Schultz U. Schwarz A. Reis L.F. Strehlow I. Decker T. Staeheli P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 975-982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We have shown previously that the induction of murine ISGF3γ (p48) gene, an IFN-γ induced component of the ISGF3 complex, occurs at a slower rate compared with other ISGs (12.Weihua X. Kolla V. Kalvakolanu D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Our studies have also identified a novel IFN-γ response element, GATE, which is preferentially regulated by IFN-γ (12.Weihua X. Kolla V. Kalvakolanu D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To define the transacting factors that interact with GATE, we have screened a cDNA expression library derived from a mouse macrophage cell line, stimulated with IFN-γ (Fig. 1), and identified the candidate cDNAs. One of these is a known transcription factor, C/EBP-β. In this study, we have shown that transcription factor C/EBP-β acts as an IFN-regulated factor. The fact that five independent clones of C/EBP-β bind to GATE, but not to a mutant GATE, indicates a specific interaction of C/EBP-β with GATE (Figs. 1 and 5). Sequence and immunoprecipitation analyses (Fig. 2 B) have established that GBF-2 is indeed C/EBP-β. This library also included the cDNAs corresponding to C/EBP-α (data not shown). However, they did not seem to bind to DNA. Consistent with this, C/EBP-a did not cause significant gene induction (Fig. 4). These observations indicate a specific binding of C/EBP-β to GATE.Although C/EBP-β binding to wild type GATE, but not to mutant GATE, can itself provide evidence for its binding specificity, it is important to note that the protocol employs a concatamerized GATE, not a monomeric GATE. It cannot distinguish whether C/EBP-β binds to GATE or junctions of tandem GATE sequences. However, EMSA with monomeric GATE provide a direct proof that full-length C/EBP-β binds to GATE (Fig. 5). The C terminus of C/EBP-β contains a b-ZIP domain and is sufficient for GATE binding (Fig. 6). Thus, interaction of C/EBP-β with GATE involves the previously identified DNA binding domain (23.Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The antibody supershift experiments (Figs. 5 C and6 D) proved that C/EBP-β indeed forms a complex with GATE. C/EBP-β consensus sequence TTNNGNAAT (14.Akira S. Kishimoto T. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 1-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Poli V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29279-29282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) has a partial homology to GATE. Six of the nine nucleotides in this region of GATE match with consensus C/EBP-β binding site. Mutation of the AAACTT nucleotides of the wild type GATE resulted in the loss of C/EBP-β binding (Figs. 1and 5). Thus, these nucleotides seem to be essential for C/EBP-β binding to GATE. Preliminary DNase I footprinting analysis suggests that the GAAACTT region of the GATE is protected by C/EBP-β (data not presented).The specificity of C/EBP-β in inducing GATE-driven gene expression was demonstrated using multiple approaches. 1) Reporter genes that contained a functional GATE were inducible by it (Fig. 3 B). 2) A C/EBP-β mutant that possessed only the DNA binding domain failed to induce gene expression (Fig. 5). 3) Other members of the C/EBP family did not induce IFN-γ-stimulated gene expression (Fig. 4). C/EBP-δ represses gene expression by possibly interfering with the function of endogenous C/EBP-β (Fig. 4). Such repression may occur via a heterodimerization between C/EBP-δ and C/EBP-β (24.Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar). Enhancement of C/EBP-β-inducible gene expression by IFN-γ suggests the participation of a protein kinase in this pathway. This observation is consistent with our earlier studies, which showed that inhibitors of protein kinases block IFN-γ-induced expression from GATE (12.Weihua X. Kolla V. Kalvakolanu D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Our recent studies show that inhibitors of the ERK pathway suppress IFN-induced gene expression (data not presented). Consistent with our original suggestion that GATE binding factors are distinct from ISRE-binding proteins, we have now identified the C/EBP-β, a factor that has not been implicated in IFN response previously.In addition to being a regulator of IFN-response, C/EBP-β is also an IFN-inducible gene (Fig. 7). In RAW macrophage cell line, the mRNA and the protein levels of C/EBP-β are induced in response to IFN-γ. Under these conditions C/EBP-α protein levels have not changed, suggesting the specific effect of IFN-γ. The induction of C/EBP-β gene is not a cell line-specific effect, because it is also induced in various tissues by IFN-γ, in vivo (Fig. 7 B). IFN-γ failed to induce C/EBP-β protein in mutant cell lines, which lacked STAT1 and JAK1 genes (data not presented). Analysis of the C/EBP-β published promoter sequence reveals a putative GAS-like element, TTCCAGGGAA (25.Chang C.J. Shen B.J. Lee S.C. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The relevance of this sequence to IFN-γ response needs to be established. Based on these results, we suggest that IFN-γ induces the expression of C/EBP-β gene, whose transcriptional activity is enhanced further by the posttranscriptional modifications stimulated by IFN-γ.To our knowledge, this is the first report that suggests a novel role for C/EBP-β in the IFN signal transduction pathway. Our data are also consistent with a previous report that identified C/EBP-β as an IFN-inducible gene (2.Der S.D. Zhou A. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15623-15628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar). We have now provided a direct evidence for C/EBP-β in the IFN signaling pathway. Previously, this factor was implicated in the regulation of gluconeogenesis, acute phase responses induced by interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and lipopolysaccharide (14.Akira S. Kishimoto T. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 1-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Poli V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29279-29282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). C/EBP-β also mediates its effects through a cyclic AMP-responsive element and ATF binding sites (26.Park E.A. Song S. Vinson C. Roesler W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 211-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27.Yamada K. Duong D.T. Scott D.K. Wang J.C. Granner D.K. J. Biol.

It also interacts with other transcription factors such as the retinoblastoma tumor suppressing protein and NF-κB (30.Stein B. Cogswell P.C. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3964-3974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although C/EBP-β induces IL-6 gene expression, its activity is repressed in the presence of wild type p53 (31.Margulies L. Sehgal P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15096-15100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, IL-6 can cross-regulate p48 gene expression through C/EBP-β (data not shown). The participation of C/EBP-β in disparate signaling pathways may be a testimony for its versatility as opposed to the promiscuity. Such plasticity may be necessary for C/EBP-β to mediate distinct biological outcomes. Indeed, mice lacking C/EBP-β gene have defects in the macrophage-dependent antibacterial and antitumor defenses (32.Tanaka T. Akira S. Yoshida K. Umemoto M. Yoneda Y. Shirafuji N. Fujiwara H. Suematsu S. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1995; 80: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), glucose homeostasis (33.Croniger C. Trus M. Lysek-Stupp K. Cohen H. Liu Y.

Lazzaro D. Sellitto C. Scarpa S. Bellavia D. Lattanzio G. Bistoni F. Frati L. Cortese R. Gulino A. Ciliberto A. Constantini F. Poli V.

Blood. 1997; 90: 156-164PubMed Google Scholar). C/EBP-β may be entailed by specific cues in each of these processes. IFN-γ signaling is critical for mediating anti-infectious pathogen defenses (36.Durbin J.E. Hackenmiller R. Simon M.C. Levy D.E.

Aguet M. Old L.J. Schreiber R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7556-7561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). The fact that C/EBP-β is regulated by IFN-γ (this report) is consistent with a hypothesis that C/EBP-β contributes partly to the in vivo effects of IFN-γ (32.Tanaka T. Akira S. Yoshida K. Umemoto M. Yoneda Y. Shirafuji N. Fujiwara H. Suematsu S. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1995; 80: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 38.Buchmeier N.A. Schreiber R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7404-7408Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IFNs have also been implicated in the cellular differentiation of certain hematopoietic cell lines (39.Resnitzky D. Yarden A. Zipori D. Kimchi A. Cell. 1986; 46: 31-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 40.Briggs R.C. Briggs J.A. Ozer J. Sealy L. Dworkin L.L. Kingsmore S.F. Seldin M.F. Kaur G.P. Athwal R.S. Dessypris E.N. Blood. 1994; 83: 2153-2162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C/EBP-β, a known regulator of differentiation (41.Seagroves T.N. Krnacik S. Raught B. Gay J. Burgess-Beusse B. Darlington G.J. Rosen J.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1917-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 42.Muller C. Kowenz-Leutz E. Grieser-Ade S. Graf T. Leutz A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6127-6135Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), may now provide a basis for such observations. Members of the interferon (IFN)1 family of cytokines regulate antiviral, antitumor, and immune responses in the vertebrates, inducing a number of cellular IFN-stimulated genes (1.Sen G.C. Ransohoff R.M. Transcriptional Regulation in the Interferon System. Chapman & Hall/Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX1997Google Scholar). IFN effects on the cells are, in part, may also be due to the repression of certain other genes (2.Der S.D. Zhou A. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15623-15628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar). ISG induction has been largely due to activation of the well established Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK)-signal-transducing activators of transcription (STAT) pathway, wherein tyrosine-phosphorylated dual function factors (i.e. STATs) directly regulate the expression of down-stream genes (3.Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3345) Google Scholar, 4.Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3361) Google Scholar). In the IFN-α/β induced response, STAT1 and STAT2, after their activation by JAK1 and TYK2, associate with ISGF3γ (p48 or IRF-9), a member of the IFN-gene regulatory factor (IRF) family (4.Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3361) Google Scholar, 5.Bluyssen A.R. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The resultant multimeric complex, ISGF3, migrates to nucleus prior to its binding to the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) and stimulation of target gene transcription (3.Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3345) Google Scholar, 4.Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3361) Google Scholar, 5.Bluyssen A.R. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In a number of tumor- and viral oncogene-expressing cell lines, down-regulation of the physical levels or inactivation of the components of ISGF3 serves as a mechanism for evading the action of IFNs (6.Wong L.H. Krauer K.G. Hatzinisiriou I. Estcourt M.J. Hersey P. Tam N.D. Edmondson S. Devenish R.J. Ralph S.J. J. Biol.

Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 166-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, ISGF3 is central to the IFN response. Although IFN-α can alone induce ISGs, pretreatment with IFN-γ causes a robust induction of these and consequent biological response (8.Lewis J.A. Huq A. Shan B. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4569-4578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Levy D.E. Lew D.J. Decker T. Kessler D.S. Darnell Jr., J.E.

This latter effect is achieved through an enhancement of the levels of ISGF3γ (9.Levy D.E. Lew D.J. Decker T. Kessler D.S. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1105-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 10.Bandyopadhyay S.K. Kalvakolanu D.V. Sen G.C. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1992; 12: 3315-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). ISGF3γ is an IFN-regulated gene, like certain other members of the IRF family (11.Veals S.A. Schindler C. Leonard D. Fu X.Y. Aebersold R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Levy D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3315-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). However, it is a slowly induced gene and requires new protein synthesis, unlike other IRFs (12.Weihua X. Kolla V. Kalvakolanu D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated earlier that GATE, a novel IFN-γ response element, and its cognate transacting factors regulate the murine p48 promoter (12.Weihua X. Kolla V. Kalvakolanu D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We have now identified the GATE binding factors (GBF) from a cDNA library prepared from an IFN-γ-stimulated macrophage cell line. Here we show that one of the GBFs is transcription factor C/EBP-β, a member of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein family (13.Lekstrom-Himes J. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28545-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). It regulates GATE-dependent gene expression, in an IFN-dependent manner. We also show that C/EBP-β (NF-IL6, LAP, NF-M, IL6-DBP) is an IFN-stimulated gene. This factor has been previously shown to regulate the type I acute phase-responsive genes, under the control of another cytokine, IL-6 (14.Akira S. Kishimoto T. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 1-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Poli V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29279-29282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Our studies for the first time demonstrate a role for C/EBP-β in the IFN signal transduction pathway and uncover a novel mechanism of IFN action. DISCUSSIONImmunoregulatory cytokine IFN-γ is critical for mediating a wide array of biological responses in the vertebrates, including antiviral and antitumor functions (17.Boehm U. Klamp T. Groot M. Howard J.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 749-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (2462) Google Scholar, 18.Kaplan D.H. Shankaran V. Dighe A.S. Stockert E. Aguet M. Old L.J. Schreiber R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7556-7561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). A number of ISGs have been identified using a variety of techniques (1.Sen G.C. Ransohoff R.M. Transcriptional Regulation in the Interferon System. Chapman & Hall/Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX1997Google Scholar, 2.Der S.D. Zhou A. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15623-15628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar). The IFN-γ-stimulated genes are induced with variable kinetics unlike those stimulated by IFN-α/β (1.Sen G.C. Ransohoff R.M. Transcriptional Regulation in the Interferon System. Chapman & Hall/Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX1997Google Scholar). All IFN responses are attributed to the activation of JAK-STAT signaling pathway, a rapidly activated and deactivated process (3.Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3345) Google Scholar, 4.Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev.

Cloning of the corresponding full-length cDNA was achieved by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using two keratinocyte libraries, one from proliferating cultured keratinocytes and one from differentiated keratinocytes of reconstructed human epidermis. The cDNA had an open reading frame encoding a new calcium-binding protein of 146 amino acids, a member of the calmodulin family.

The stratum corneum is generated by keratinocytes which migrate from the basal layer to the surface of the epidermis undergoing terminal differentiation, a process which is known to be calcium dependent (1.Hennings H. Michael D. Cheng C. Steinert P. Holbrook K. Yuspa S. Cell. 1980; 19: 245-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar). Low concentrations of calcium in the basal layer of the epidermis favor keratinocyte proliferation and an increasing calcium gradient toward the surface controls part of the complex differentiation program (2.Boyce S.T. Ham R.G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1983; 81: 33s-40sAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). This is why calcium-binding proteins, which mediate calcium signals by interacting with and modulating specific target proteins, are of particular interest to understand and eventually modulate epidermal differentiation. Calmodulin (CaM),1 the major calcium-binding protein (CaBP) in non-muscular tissue is known to interact with at least 50 different target enzymes and structural proteins (3.Tabernero L. Taylor D.A.

Structure. 1997; 5: 613-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) including protein kinases, phosphatases, phosphodiesterases, ATPases, and NO-synthases, mediating many biological processes (4.Crivici A. Ikura M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 5.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). CaM, a small acidic protein (16.7 kDa), was discovered in 1970 (6.Cheung W.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 38: 733-734Crossref Scopus (540) Google Scholar). It is a member of the CaBP family that includes troponin C, calmodulin-like protein, squidulin, calcium-dependent protein-kinase, and caltractin. CaM is composed of 148 amino acid residues, two globular domains, and a single peptide chain containing 4 calcium-binding sites. The calcium-binding sites are helix-loop-helix domains, also named EF-hands, similar to those of other calcium-binding proteins. CaM is found in all eukaryotic cells and its amino acid sequence is highly conserved, in particular its primary amino acid sequence which is virtually identical in many different species. The binding of calcium induces large conformational changes of CaM which results in the exposure of hydrophobic regions, providing high affinity binding sites for target proteins. CaM is reported to be implicated in the regulation of keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. In highly proliferating in vitro cultures of keratinocytes, and in psoriasis, a hyperproliferative, epidermal skin disease, CaM levels are particularly elevated (7.Fairley J.A. Marcelo C.L. Hogan V.A. Voorhees J.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1985; 84: 195-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 8.Mizumoto T. Hashimoto Y. Hirokawa M. Ohkuma N. Iizuka H. Ohkawara A. J.

Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2070-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and the CaM regulation of human platelet transglutaminase (factor XIII), no specific information is available on the mediation of calcium signals in the epidermis to control keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. Thus, the discovery of new calcium-binding protein, specific for the epidermis, could help to better understand the mediation of calcium signals in the skin. Here we describe the isolation, characterization, and cloning of a new CaM-like protein of the human epidermis and discuss its possible involvement in epidermal differentiation. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, CHAPS, and glutathione-Sepharose matrix were purchased from Sigma. Immobiline pH gradient (IPG) solution, IPG strips, premade SDS-PAGE gels, Rainbow™ molecular weight markers, silver staining kit, first-strand synthesis kit, Escherichia coli strain BL21, Pgex-2T plasmid and phenyl-Superose HR5/5 column were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. RNase, DNase, thrombin,Taq polymerase, pfu polymerase, and restriction enzymes were from Promega. The RNA preparation kit RNeasy was obtained from Qiagen. Oligonucleotides were synthetized by Genset and PCR-ready cDNA kits were from Maxim Biotech. Calmodulin from human erythrocytes was obtained from Fluka, and calmodulin from hog brain was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Biomol Green™ Calcineurin assay kit number AK-804 was obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Stratum corneum samples of healthy normal human skin were obtained using a slightly modified varnish stripping procedure previously described (11.Lundström A. Egelrud T. Acta Derm. Venereol. (Stockh.). 1991; 71: 471-474PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were washed 3× in acetone to obtain a varnish-free stratum corneum acetone powder. To extract the proteins, 80 mg of the powder were rehydrated with 2.5 ml of buffer (28 mm Tris-HCl, 22 mm Tris base, containing 0.3% SDS). The mixture was homogenized in a potter and boiled for 10 min. After centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min), the supernatant (2 ml) was recovered and passed through a 0.22-μm membrane filter. Proteins were precipitated by adding 10 ml of ice-cold acetone. After 20 min incubation, precipitated proteins were recovered by centrifugation (9,400 × g for 10 min), dried at room temperature for 20 min, and solubilized in 300 μl of 2D buffer (8 m urea, 2% (w/v) CHAPS, 20 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.5% (v/v) IPG solution pH 3–10). Isoelectric focusing was performed using a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Multiphor II system. One IPG strip, pH 3–10, was incubated for 6 h at room temperature with 290 μl (320 μg of protein) of the solubilized proteins plus 80 μl of 2D buffer. Another IPG strip, for a parallel run to be silver stained, was treated the same way, however, loaded with only 10 μg of protein. Thereafter IPG strips were focused at 20 °C with constant voltage at 150 V for 1 h, 300 V for 4 h, 600 V for 4 h, 1,500 V for 12 h, and 3,500 V for 17 h to a total of 81,250 Vh. IPG was re-equilibrated following the manufacturer's instructions, except that iodoacetamide was omitted. Horizontal SDS electrophoresis was performed on pre-fabricated gel bond PAG film-supported gels (12–14% gradient) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the second dimension, pre-stained molecular weight markers were included after a 1:4 dilution for Amido Black staining (12.Chen H. Chen H. Bjerkness M. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 295-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and 1:100 dilution for silver staining. The apparent M r values were calculated using the Quantity One™ software from Bio-Rad. After staining, protein spots from the Amido Black-stained two-dimensional gel were recovered by performing 3-mm punch biopsies. In-gel digestion by trypsin was performed as described by Kawasaki et al. (13.Kawasaki H. Emori Y. Suzuki K. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 191: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Peptides were separated by a tandem high performance liquid chromatography procedure (14.Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 186: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and peptide sequencing was performed on a Applied Biosystem 494 device. cDNA was cloned by RT-PCR. Total RNA was obtained from reconstructed human epidermis. RNA was prepared using a RNeasy kit. Briefly, two samples of the reconstructed epidermis (1 cm2 each) were homogenized in 300 μl of lysis buffer (included in the kit) and the cell debris removed using a QIA shredder column. cDNA was produced from purified total RNA (2 μg) using the First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit. One to 5 μl of generated first-strand cDNA, with NotI-d(T)18 as primer was directly used for PCR. A cDNA fragment (750 base pairs) was amplified by PCR in a Perkin-Elmer thermocycler using pfu polymerase and a degenerated oligonucleotide (sc5) and theNotI-d(T)18 oligonucleotide (TableI) as primers under the following conditions: 1 cycle for 2 min at 95 °C, 30 cycles (94 °C for 1 min, 47 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min) and 1 cycle at 72 °C for 7 min. Amino acid sequence was deduced from direct sequencing of the PCR product. To identify the 5′-part of the sequence of CLSP, PCR was performed using as template an amplified human keratinocyte cDNA library made in Lambda ZAPTM II vector (kind gift of Dr. S. Michel). The following primers were used for PCR, sc10 (end of CLSP sequence, including the stop codon) and sc7 (SK-primer) (TableI), applying 1 cycle for 2 min at 95 °C, 35 cycles (94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min), and 1 cycle at 72 °C for 7 min. The resulting amplicon was used as template for a subsequent PCR with sc7 and sc21 (Table I) as primers applying the following conditions: 1 cycle for 2 min at 95 °C, 35 cycles (94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s) and 1 cycle at 72 °C for 10 min. From this final PCR a band of 350 base pairs was gel purified and sequenced using sc21 as sequencing-primer. Full cDNA of CLSP (456 base pairs) was generated by PCR using pfu polymerase and sc16 and sc29 (Table I) as primers under the following conditions: 1 cycle for 2 min at 95 °C, 35 cycles (94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s) and 1 cycle at 72 °C for 5 min The sc16 and sc29 primers contained restriction sites (BamHI/EcoRI) to facilitate the incorporation of cDNA into pGex-2T plasmid. This construct, containing in-frame the coding region for CLSP and glutathioneS-transferase, was used to transfect E. colistrain BL21. This fusion vector also produces a thrombin protease recognition site for cleaving rCLSP from its fusion protein under mild conditions. Expression and purification of rCLSP were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the positive clone 46046e7 was inoculated and pre-cultured in bacterial Luria-Bertani (LB) broth growth medium, containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, before being transferred into a 1-liter culture medium. After a 7-h culture at 30 °C, when the A 595reached 0.9, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.1 mm) was added, the temperature lowered to 25 °C, and the culture continued for 18 h. Thereafter, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 20 min, at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in ice-cold 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 150 mm NaCl and pelleted by centrifugation. To lyse the cells, the pellet was resuspended in 75 ml of ice-cold 200 mm NaOH and stirred for 10 min at room temperature before genomic DNA was broken by repeated passages of the suspension through a tight syringe. The lysate was then neutralized by the addition of 75 ml of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 10 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 35 units of RNase, and 200 units of DNase and mixed for 30 min at 25 °C. Insoluble material was discarded by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The fusion protein containing supernatant was applied onto a 15-ml glutathione-Sepharose affinity column with a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Thereafter, the column was washed (0.5 ml/min) first with 2 bed volumes of PBS containing 1 mm EDTA, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, then with 2 bed volumes of PBS containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and finally with 2 bed volumes of PBS only. To liberate rCLSP, 42 units of thrombin in 5 ml of PBS were applied and the column kept at room temperature for 20 h. Thereafter, rCLSP was eluted by washing the column with 10 ml of PBS. Eluted fractions were pooled and kept at 4 °C or at −20 °C in presence of 0.02% sodium azide.Table IOligomer primers used in RT-PCR and PCR5′-GCNGTNGAYACNGAYGGNAAYGGN-3′ (sc5, CLSP, S)5′-CGCTCTAGAACTAGTGGATC-3′ (sc7, SK)5′-TCACTCCTGGGCGAGCATC-3′ (sc10, CLSP, AS)5′GGATGGCGACGGCCACATC-3′ (sc13, CLSP, S)5′-ATAAAGATGGCGATGGCACCAT-3′ (sc14, CaM, S)5′-CCATTGCCATCCTTGTCAAAGA-3′ (sc15, CaM, AS)5′-TTGAATTCTCACTCCTGGGCGAGC-3′ (sc16, CLSP, AS)5′-CTGGGCCTCCGAGAGGTT-3′ (sc21, CLSP, AS)5′-GATAGGATCCATGGCCGGTGAGCTGACTCCTGAGGAG-3′ (sc29, CLSP, S)5′-TTGACACGGATGGAAACGGC-3′ (sc33, CLSP, S)5′-TCCTCGTAGTTCACCCGCCC-3′ (sc34, CLSP, AS)5′-AGAGGTGGTCTGGGTCTGCT-3′ (filaggrin, S)5′-GCACTTGATCTTGCCTGTTC-3′ (filaggrin, AS)5′-AGTTCCAGCGTGAGGTTTGT-3′ (keratin 1, S)5′-GGGACTGAGATTGCCACTGA-3′ (keratin 1, AS)5′-ACCACGGAGGCGAAGGAGTT-3′ (loricrin, S)5′-CTGGGGTTGGGAGGTAGTTG-3′ (loricrin, AS)5′-AATCCCATCACCATCTTCCA-3′ (GAPDH, S)5′-GTCATCATATTTGGCAGGTT-3′ (GAPDH, AS)S, sense primer; AS, antisense primer.

Normal human keratinocytes were cultured in a serum containing low calcium medium (0.1 mm) and harvested before reaching confluence (15.Watt F.M. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 90: 525-529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To study CLSP expression during epidermal differentiation, reconstructed skin samples were used at different degrees of differentiation (days 1 to 13). Analysis of CLSP expression in different human tissues was performed using PCR-ready cDNA Kits. PCR was performed using a Taq polymerase and different sets of primers (sc10 and sc13, sc21 and sc29, sc33 and sc34, sc16 and sc33, Table I) under the following conditions: 1 cycle for 2 min at 95 °C, 25–30 cycles (94 °C for 30 s, 55–60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s) and 1 cycle at 72 °C for 2 min. In parallel, and under the same conditions, human CaM, filaggrin, loricrin, keratin 1, and GAPDH expression were analyzed (primers are listed in Table I). The resulting PCR products were visualized by ethidium bromide staining after separation on 2–3% (w/v) agarose gels. rCLSP and CaM from human erythrocytes were submitted to SDS-PAGE using a slightly modified procedure described by Burgesset al. (16.Burgess W.H. Jemiolo D.K. Kretsinger R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 623: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). We used a calcium concentration of 1 mm, and did not include EDTA and calcium into the 15% acrylamide gel. Prestained molecular weight markers served as standards and proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. rCLSP and CaM from hog brain were loaded in buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 500 mm NaCl) onto a phenyl-Superose column HR5/5, connected to an Äkta Explorer™ chromatography station. Two different experiments were performed to elute the proteins. In a first experiment, a buffer B (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mmMgCl2, 500 mm NaCl) gradient (0–100%) was used. In the second experiment, a buffer C (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 40% (v/v) ethylene glycol) gradient (0–100%) was used. All chromatographic experiments were performed at room temperature and protein elution was monitored by recording the A 280 nm. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE in a 15% (w/v) gel. Affinity columns with 1-ml bead volumes were used. Purified rCLSP was immobilized on a CNBr-activated Sepharose column from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, following the manufacturer's instructions, using 1.3 mg of rCLSP/ml of beads. The coupling efficiency was 0.95 mg of rCLSP/ml of beads, calculated from the ratio of rCLSP in solution before and after incubation with the activated matrix. For the CaM affinity chromatography, a commercially available CaM-agarose matrix (Sigma) was used. The initial concentration of 1.7 mg of CaM/ml of beads was adjusted with inactivated Sepharose 4B to match that of the rCLSP column. Human epidermis (0.83 g of abdominal skin from plastic surgery) and plantar stratum corneum (100 g) were homogenized with a Polytron in 10 and 120 ml, respectively, of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™ EDTA-free from Roche Molecular, complemented with 1 μm pepstatin). The suspensions were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were passed over 0.22-μm filters and adjusted to 2.5 mm CaCl2 before chromatographic separation at room temperature on CaM and rCLSP affinity columns. Thereafter, the columns were washed with 10 column volumes of sample buffer. Elution was performed using the same buffer containing 5 mm EDTA instead 2.5 mm CaCl2. The eluted proteins were submitted to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis on pre-fabricated gel bond PAG film-supported gels (12.5% homogeneous gels) and silver stained according to the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech's instructions. A comparison of the protein pattern in the two-dimensional gels obtained after silver and Amido Black staining (Fig. 1) revealed that two acidic spots with 7,000 M r (noted 2D1 and 2D2) which appeared only after Amido Black staining and were not decorated by silver nitrate. The high performance liquid chromatography profiles of the tryptic digest of the two spots were essentially identical (data not shown). Analysis of the internal sequence (TableII) and a subsequent homology search, using the 2D1/pept1 (Table II) as a probe, revealed the highest score for a CaBP of the CaM family (data not shown). The protein was named calmodulin-like skin protein (CLSP).Table IIAmino acid sequence analysis of spots derived from the two-dimensional gel (Fig. 1)Spot number/peptide numberAmino acid sequence2D1 /pept1AFSAVDTDGNGTINAQELGAALK2D1 /pept2NLSEAQLRaMajor sequence.2D1 /pept2ELGAALKbMinor sequence.2D1 /pept3LISEVDSDGDGEISFQEFLTAAXKcX, unidentified residue.2D1 /pept4EFLTAAaMajor sequence.2D1 /pept4NLSEAQLRbMinor sequence.2D2 /pept1AFSAa Major sequence.b Minor sequence.c X, unidentified residue. Open table in a new tab From the peptide sequence 2D1/pept1 (Table II) of CLSP, we designed a degenerated oligomer (sc5) and performed RT-PCR on a cDNA λgt11 keratinocyte library and on reconstructed human epidermis after 13 days of culture. The resulting full CLSP cDNA presented in Fig.2 contained an open reading frame encoding for a protein of 146 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence had 52% homology with human CaM (Fig.3 A). The alignment of the CLSP amino acid sequence with those of other members of the CaM family (Fig.3 A) revealed an important homology among human CaM,Chlamydomonas CaM and human CLP, whereas the homology with CLSP was less important. A phylogenetic analysis of the CaM family and CLSP, presented in Fig. 3 B, underlines the difference between CLSP and CaM.Figure 3Multiple amino acid sequence alignment of CLSP with five other EF-hand proteins ( CaM from unicellular algaChlamydomonas, human CaM , troponin C, caltractin isoform 1, and calmodulin-like protein). A, the amino acid sequences of known EF-hand proteins were extracted from the SwissProt data base, and multiple alignment was performed with the antheprot 4.3b program, selecting the multalin option. Common residues between EF-hand proteins and CLSP are shaded. Gaps are indicated bydashes. B, the alignment was used to establish a phylogenetic relationship between EF-hand proteins, calculated with the puzzle 3.1 program and represented by the treeview 1.5.2 program of T. M. Roderic.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) RT-PCR was performed to study the expression of CLSP in different human tissues including heart, testis, skeletal muscle, pancreas, liver, small intestine, placenta, spleen, kidney, lung, and reconstructed human epidermis. Using different sets of primers coding for CLSP (TableI), abundant CLSP expression was only detected in reconstructed human epidermis (Fig. 4 A). A very faint expression of CLSP was observed in lung tissue. On the contrary, CaM was expressed in all analyzed tissues, suggesting an important tissue specificity of CLSP. To evaluate whether the expression of CLSP in the epidermis correlates with keratinocyte differentiation, RT-PCR experiments were performed in nonconfluent, proliferating human keratinocytes and in differentiating keratinocytes using reconstructed epidermis at different stages of culture. CLSP was not detected in proliferating cells and appeared only in differentiating keratinocytes between days 6 and 7, at an already advanced stage of keratinocyte differentiation, i.e. when other markers of keratinocyte differentiation like loricrin and filaggrin (17.Steven A.C. Bisher M.E. Roop D.R. Steinert P.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1990; 104: 150-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) are already expressed (Fig. 4, B andC). In contrast, CaM is expressed in both, proliferating and differentiating keratinocytes. Fig.5 shows the electrophoretic mobility of rCLSP and CaM in the presence and absence of calcium. Both proteins exhibit the same calcium-dependent mobility. In the presence of calcium, CaM and rCLSP appeared as a single band with an apparent molecular weight of 12,700 and 12,900, respectively, whereas in the absence of calcium, the apparent molecular weight was 18,300 and 18,900, respectively. The calcium binding properties of CLSP were further studied using HIC. CLSP and CaM adsorbed to the phenyl-Superose matrix in the presence of calcium and were eluted in a sharp peak by an EGTA gradient (Fig. 6 A). Subsequent SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed the recovery of all injected CaM and CLSP in three 0.2-ml fractions (Fig. 6 B). To distinguish between the possibilities that the delayed elution of CLSP as compared with CaM (Fig. 6 A) is due to a higher calcium affinity or a stronger hydrophobic interaction of CLSP, we eluted both proteins with an ethylene glycol gradient (Fig. 7). The result shows that the stronger hydrophobic interaction of CLSP is most likely responsible for its retarded elution from the HIC matrix.Figure 6Phenyl-Superose chromatography of rCLSP and CaM from hog brain eluted with an EGTA gradient.

Epidermal proteins eluted from the rCLSP column are quantitatively and qualitatively distinct from those recovered from the CaM column (lane E1 to be compared withlane E2). The same holds true for the stratum corneum extract (compare lanes PSC1 and PSC2), indicating a distinct target specificity for CaM and rCLSP. The newly identified calcium-binding protein, which we named CLSP due to its abundant expression in human epidermis, has a calculated molecular mass of 15.9 kDa. The fragments of CLSP which were extracted from human stratum corneum exhibited an apparent molecular weight of 7,000, representing the NH2-terminal part of the protein, including two of the four calcium-binding loops. Even though we do not have data of the endogenous CLSP and its processing, the 7,000 fragments probably represent proteolytically degraded parts of CLSP generated to deactivate the protein. Like previously described for CaM (18.Katoka M. Head J.F. Seaton B.A. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6944-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), proteolysis of CLSP could result in the formation of two independent globular domains that still bind the target molecules, however, with reduced affinity, insufficient for their activation. Since CLSP contains two potential sites for N-glycosylation (amino acids 25 and 43), multiple sites for phosphorylation and one for myristoylation (amino acid 26), it is important to study its possible post-translational modifications which could affect and diversify CLSP activity. For CaM, several post-translational modifications such as acylation of the amino terminus, (tri-)methylation of Lys115, and phosphorylation are described (19.Cheung W.Y. Lynch T.J. Wallace R.W. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1978; 9: 233-251PubMed Google Scholar), the latter affecting its solubility and calcium affinity. Compared with CaM, the CLSP has a distinct amino acid composition, in particular an increased number alanine and less methionine and threonine. As in CaM, cysteine and tryptophan are absent. The unusual high methionine content of CaM (6.1%), compared with a 1.5% average in proteins listed in the standard protein data base (20.Rose G.D. Geselowitz A.R. Lesser G.J. Lee R.H. Zehfus M.H. Science. 1985; 229: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar), has been suggested to be responsible for certain binding characteristics of CaM. The flexible and polarizable methionine side chains are responsible for the strong but nonspecific van der Waals interaction of CaM with a multitude of receptor molecules (21.O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 22.Vogel H.J. Zhang M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 149/150: 3-15Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The considerably lower content in methionine residues in CLSP, compared with CaM, could indicate a more specific and restricted target interaction of CLSP. The lack of cysteine explains why CLSP fragments were not stained with silver nitrate in the two-dimensional gels (23.Merril C.R. Dunn M.J. Electrophoresis ‘86. VCH Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, 1986: 273Google Scholar). A comparison of the amino acid composition of the calcium-binding loop in canonical EF-hands and in CLSP shows a very good correlation, in particular amino acids located at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, and 12 of rCLSP (Table III). An exception is the histidine in loop 3 of CLSP at ligand position 7. All of the above results indicate the presence of 4 calcium-binding sites in CLSP. The SDS-PAGE, as well as the HIC experiments performed in the presence and absence of calcium, clearly demonstrate the interaction of rCLSP with calcium. The binding of calcium modifies the electrophoretic mobility of rCLSP and induces conformational changes which results in the exposure of a hydrophobic region. This hydrophobic region binds more strongly to the HIC matrix than the hydrophobic region of CaM, as revealed by the elution profile with an ethylene glycol gradient and confirmed by its computer calculated hydrophobicity (data not shown) (26.Fauchere J.L. Pliska V. Eur. J. Med.

The results obtained so far are all in favor of a calmodulin-like functionality of CLSP, i.e. a conformational change upon calcium binding with subsequent exposition of a hydrophobic region, able to recognize and interact with specific target proteins. The different amino acid composition, as well as the localization of its hydrophobic regions indicate that CLSP may interact with target molecules distinct from CaM. Another argument for a distinct physiological role of CLSP is the fact that, unlike CaM, which has a ubiquitous tissue distribution, CLSP appears to be specific for the skin, where its expression is related to epidermal differentiation, a process known to be closely under the control of a calcium gradient. To investigate whether CaM and rCLSP interact with distinct epidermal proteins, we performed several experiments. First we tested whether calcineurin, a known protein phosphatase activated by CaM, can also be activated by rCLSP. Unlike CaM, rCLSP was unable to activate calcineurin in a concentration range from 10 nm to 10 μm (data not shown) indicating that the two proteins are not interchangeable. Further evidence for a distinct reactivity of CaM compared with rCLSP was obtained from affinity chromatographic studies with protein extracts from human epidermis and stratum corneum. Proteins retained by the CaM affinity column are quantitatively and qualitatively distinct from those of the rCLSP column (Fig. 8). Experiments are in progress to provide functional, physiological relevance of CLSP in the epidermis by characterizing the affinity purified proteins. Sequencing one of the purified proteins revealed a 100% homology with transglutaminase 3, a known calcium-dependent enzyme, expressed during a late stage of epidermal differentiation. Transglutaminases are key enzymes of epidermal differentiation (24.Reichert U. Michel S. Schmidt R. Darmon M. Blumenberg M. Molecular Biology of the Skin.

https://openalex.org/W2056901381,"Type IV collagen includes six genetically distinct polypeptides named α1(IV) through α6(IV). These isoforms are speculated to organize themselves into unique networks providing mammalian basement membranes specificity and inequality. Recent studies using bovine and human glomerular and testis basement membranes have shown that unique networks of collagen comprising either α1 and α2 chains or α3, α4, and α5 chains can be identified. These studies have suggested that assembly of α5 chain into type IV collagen network is dependent on α3 expression where both chains are normally present in the tissue. In the present study, we show that in the lens and inner ear of normal mice, expression of α1, α2, α3, α4, and α5 chains of type IV collagen can be detected using α chain-specific antibodies. In the α3(IV) collagen-deficient mice, only the expression of α1, α2, and α5 chains of type IV collagen was detectable. The non-collagenous 1 domain of α5 chain was associated with α1 in the non-collagenous 1 domain hexamer structure, suggesting that network incorporation of α5 is possible in the absence of the α3 chain in these tissues. The present study proves that expression of α5 is not dependent on the expression of α3 chain in these tissues and that α5 chain can assemble into basement membranes in the absence of α3 chain. These findings support the notion that type IV collagen assembly may be regulated by tissue-specific factors. Type IV collagen includes six genetically distinct polypeptides named α1(IV) through α6(IV). These isoforms are speculated to organize themselves into unique networks providing mammalian basement membranes specificity and inequality. Recent studies using bovine and human glomerular and testis basement membranes have shown that unique networks of collagen comprising either α1 and α2 chains or α3, α4, and α5 chains can be identified. These studies have suggested that assembly of α5 chain into type IV collagen network is dependent on α3 expression where both chains are normally present in the tissue. In the present study, we show that in the lens and inner ear of normal mice, expression of α1, α2, α3, α4, and α5 chains of type IV collagen can be detected using α chain-specific antibodies. In the α3(IV) collagen-deficient mice, only the expression of α1, α2, and α5 chains of type IV collagen was detectable. The non-collagenous 1 domain of α5 chain was associated with α1 in the non-collagenous 1 domain hexamer structure, suggesting that network incorporation of α5 is possible in the absence of the α3 chain in these tissues. The present study proves that expression of α5 is not dependent on the expression of α3 chain in these tissues and that α5 chain can assemble into basement membranes in the absence of α3 chain. These findings support the notion that type IV collagen assembly may be regulated by tissue-specific factors. non-collagenous 1 Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm sarcoma glomerular basement membrane seminiferous tubule basement membrane wild type α3 type IV collagen-deficient mice enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay anterior lens capsular basement membrane Type IV collagen is a family of complex polypeptides and a major constituent of mammalian basement membranes (1.Timpl R.

The α1(IV) and α2(IV) chains are products of distinct genes located pairwise in a head-to-head fashion on chromosome 13 in humans (3.Hudson B.G. Reeders S.T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26033-26036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α3(IV) and α4(IV) chains are present in the same orientation on chromosome 2, and the α5(IV) and α6(IV) chains are located on the X chromosome in humans (4.Hudson B. Wisdom B. Gunwar S. Noelken M. Kang A. Pathobiochemistry. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 17-30Google Scholar). The type IV collagen protomer (trimer) consists of three α chains that come together through associations among their NC11 globular domains followed by folding of the collagenous domains into triple helices through covalent and non-covalent interactions (1.Timpl R.

The protomer is divided into three different domains: an NH2-terminal 7 S domain, a middle triple-helical domain, and a COOH-terminal NC1 globular domain (1.Timpl R. Eur. J.

With six different α chains known at present, 56 different combinations of triple-helical protomers are possible (1.Timpl R. Eur. J.

Transplantable, basement membrane-producing mouse Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm sarcoma (EHS) tumor is a plentiful source of type IV collagen (2.Paulsson M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 27: 93-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Type IV collagen isolated from EHS tumor contains only α1 and α2 chains (7.Wisdom B.J.J. Gunwar S. Hudson M.D. Noelken M.E. Hudson B.G. Connect. Tissue Res. 1992; 27: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These chains were identified to exist as an α1/α2 type IV collagen protomer in a 2:1 ratio (1.Timpl R.

By use of rotary shadow electron microscopy it could be shown that four protomers of type IV collagen are connected by association of the 7 S domain forming a spider-shaped structure (1.Timpl R. Eur.

Each protomer is bonded with another protomer by its NC1 domain to form interlocking hexamers (6.Yurchenco P.D. Ruben G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2559-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The combination of these two types of interaction along with extensive side-by-side (lateral) associations within the collagenous triple helix allows the formation of a network that serves as a scaffold for the basement membrane (6.Yurchenco P.D. Ruben G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2559-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Type IV collagen protomer compositions in the human basement membranes are still largely unknown. Most of our current understanding of the structure and self-aggregating properties of type IV collagen is derived from studies using mouse EHS tumor, which contains only α1 and α2 chains (1.Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 487-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 2.Paulsson M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 27: 93-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 4.Hudson B.

Recently, all six chains of type IV collagen were identified by protein biochemistry techniques using bovine testis and kidney GBM (8.Gunwar S. Ballester F. Noelken M.E. Sado Y. Ninomiya Y.

In these studies, pseudolysin (Pseudomonas elastase) at two different temperatures was shown to extract two different populations of type IV collagen selectively (8.Gunwar S. Ballester F.

These reports speculate that type IV collagen networks involving the α3, α4, and α5 chains may play a unique role in the specialized basement membranes such as seminiferous tubule basement membrane (STBM) and GBM (8.Gunwar S.

Additionally, recent experiments have shown that in most cases, α5 chain mutations in Alport syndrome (an X-linked hereditary kidney disease) lead to an absence of α3 chain of type IV collagen in the GBM of these patients (10.Atkins C.L.

These studies, along with immunoprecipitation experiments using human GBM hexamers, have led to the suggestion that α5 and α3 are regulated tightly in their expression and are dependent on each other to form protomeric network of type IV collagen (9.Kahsai T.Z.

Identification of new chains of type IV collagen with their restricted tissue distribution and the presence of separate networks raises a number of unanswered biological questions pertaining to the assembly of these polypeptides (3.Hudson B.G. Reeders S.T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26033-26036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is important to determine the organization of newly discovered human type IV collagen α chains in forming protomers (trimers) and to determine how these new molecules might contribute to the structural and functional diversity of basement membranes. In the present study, we isolated type IV collagen from the α3 collagen-deficient mice and their wild type (WT) littermates and evaluated their type IV collagen α chain composition and NC1 hexamer organization. All chemical reagents, horseradish peroxidase, and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibodies toward mouse, rabbit, and human IgG were purchased from Sigma and Fisher Scientific. Type IV collagen-specific antibodies were generated and specificity determined as described previously in other publications (9.Kahsai T.Z. Enders G.C. Gunwar S. Brunmark C. Wieslander J. Kalluri R.

Prior to staining, sections were first denatured by immersion in 6.0 m urea and 0.1 m glycine (pH 3.5) for 1 h at 50 °C.

Briefly, 10 mg of collagenase digest of detergent-extracted inner ear, lens, and kidney GBM from WT and knockout mice were incubated with antibodies to the α chains, and the resultant mixture was precipitated with antibodies to rabbit IgG conjugated to protein A and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting, and ELISA. All values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Analysis of variance with a one-tailed Student's ttest was used to identify significant differences in multiple comparisons. A level of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Immunofluorescence analysis was used to examine α chain composition, in control versus α3KO mice, of the STBM; the GBM; the basement membranes of the inner ear, including the strial capillary basement membrane; and the lens capsule. As illustrated in Fig. 1 and reported previously for STBM (9.Kahsai T.Z. Enders G.C. Gunwar S. Brunmark C. Wieslander J. Kalluri R. Zhou J. Noelken M.E. Hudson B.G. J. Biol.

This same pattern of expression is observed in the GBM and the basement membranes of the renal tubules of normal versus mutant mice (Fig. 1, α3KO,Kidney), consistent with earlier reports (12.Kashtan C.E.

However, in the anterior capsular material of the lens and the strial capillary basement membranes, the scenario is different. Here, in the α3KO mice, the α5(IV) chain continues to be assembled in the absence of α3(IV) and α4(IV) chains (Fig.2). In the inner ear, mid-modiolar cross- sections reveal that the track of basement membrane running from the limbus, down the inner sulcus, across the basilar membrane, up the external sulcus to the spiral prominence, and radiating into the spiral ligament surrounding the root cell processes in tissue from the mutant mouse is devoid of collagen α3(IV), α4(IV), and α5(IV) chains (Fig. 2). In contrast, in the capillaries of the stria vascularis, the collagen α5(IV) chain is assembled into basement membrane (see structures denoted by arrows in Fig. 2, Inner ear WT and α3KO for α5 antibodies). We extracted type IV collagen from detergent extracts of anterior lens capsule, cochlea, kidney cortex, and testis by bacterial collagenase from the control and α3KO mice. The collagenase-solubilized material analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining revealed major sets of bands in the region of 46 kDa and 28 kDa (data not shown), consistent with the pattern seen for denatured NC1 hexamer from various tissues (32.Gunwar S.

The α1, α2, α5, and α6 chains were present in all tissues analyzed (Fig.3). The α3 and α4 chains were present in the control cochlea, anterior lens capsule, kidney cortex, and the testis, but they were absent in the tissues of the α3KO mice. These results are consistent with the results observed in the immunofluorescence experiments (Figs. 1 and 2). Immunoblotting experiments correlate well with the ELISA experiments. The α1/α2 antibodies show binding to the dimeric (∼46 kDa) and monomeric (∼28 kDa) forms of the NC1 domain of α1 and α2 chains of type IV collagen in all the tissues analyzed (Fig.4). The α5 chain was present in all the tissues analyzed except for the α3KO kidney and testis (Fig. 4). The α3 and α4 were detectable only in the WT anterior lens, cochlea, and the kidney and were absent in all tissue analyzed in the α3KO mice (data not shown). These results suggest that α5 expression is present in the inner ear cochlea and anterior lens capsule of the α3KO but is absent in the kidney cortex of the same mice.Figure 4Immunoblot analysis for type IV collagen isoforms in mice.

Moreover, chromogranin A (CGA) has been shown to interact with several secretory granule membrane proteins, including the IP3 receptor (IP3R). To determine whether the IP3Rs interact directly with chromogranins A and B (CGB), two major proteins of the secretory granules, we have used purified IP3R from bovine cerebellum in the interaction study with CGA and CGB, and have shown that chromogranins A and B directly interact with the IP3R at the intravesicular pH 5.5. Immunogold cytochemical study using the IP3R and CGA antibodies indicated that IP3R-labeled gold particles were localized in the periphery of the secretory granules, indicating the presence of the IP3Rs on the secretory granule membrane. To determine whether the IP3R and chromogranins A and B are physically linked in the cells, bovine type 1 IP3R (IP3R-1) and CGA or CGB are co-transfected into COS-7 cells and co-immunoprecipitation was carried out. Immunoprecipitation of the cell extracts demonstrated the presence of CGA-IP3R-1 and CGB-IP3R-1 complexes, respectively, indicating the complex formation between the IP3R and chromogranins A and B in native state.

Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13446-13448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this observation has also been extended to the secretory granule of zymogen-secreting pancreatic acinar cells (2.Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Belan P.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1996; 84: 473-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), demonstrating the IP3-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ store role of secretory granules. Recently, direct participation of secretory granule calcium in the control of cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration has also been demonstrated in the secretory granules of goblet cells (3.Nguyen T. Chin W.-C. Verdugo P. Nature. 1998; 395: 908-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) in that uptake of Ca2+ by the secretory granules was temporally and spatially matched by simultaneous reduction of Ca2+ concentration in the surrounding cytoplasm, whereas IP3-mediated release of Ca2+ by the secretory granules resulted in the simultaneous increase of cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration in the immediate vicinity of the secretory granules, clearly indicating the participation of secretory granule calcium in the control of cytoplasmic Ca2+concentration. Moreover, the IP3-sensitive Ca2+store role of secretory granules of bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin cells was attributed to the presence of high capacity, low affinity Ca2+ storage protein CGA, binding 30–50 mol of Ca2+/mol, inside the secretory granule (1.Yoo S.H.

IP3 mediates release of Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+ stores by binding to the IP3R, which can also function as Ca2+ channel (5.Ferris C.D. Huganir R.L. Supattapone S. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1989; 42: 87-89Crossref Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The IP3R/Ca2+ channel consists of four molecules of IP3R, which is known to exist in at least three types,i.e. types I, II, and III, and to form homo- or heterotetrameric structures (6.Supattapone S.

In our previous study, chromogranin A was shown to interact with several integral membrane proteins of secretory granules of bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin cells, including the IP3R (14.Yoo S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12001-12006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although it was not known at the time whether the interaction is direct or not. This was the first time an ion channel protein was shown to be physically linked to a cognate ion storage protein. Soon after the report of presence of the IP3R on the secretory granule membranes (14.Yoo S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12001-12006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Blondel et al. (15.Blondel O. Moody M.M. Depaoli A.M. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Swift H. Bell G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7777-7781Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) reported that the type III IP3R antibody reacts with IP3Rs in the secretory granules of insulin-secreting pancreatic β-cells and somatostatin-secreting δ-cells. However, this study has been questioned due to controversies raised regarding the specificity of the IP3R antibody used; Ravazolla et al. (16.Ravazzola M. Halban P.A. Orci L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2745-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) pointed out the possibility that the IP3R antibody used in the pancreatic β-cell study might have interacted with insulins in the secretory granules. Chromogranin A is the major secretory granule matrix protein of bovine adrenal chromaffin cells and interacts with the secretory granule membrane at the intravesicular pH of 5.5, but dissociates from it at the near physiological pH of 7.5 (17.Yoo S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8213-8219Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It undergoes pH- and Ca2+-dependent conformational changes (18.Yoo S.H. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14414-14421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and forms a homodimer at pH 7.5 and a homotetramer at pH 5.5 (19.Yoo S.H. Lewis M.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1223-1231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Chromogranin A also interacts with chromogranin B (CGB), another major protein of secretory granules of neuroendocrine cells (21.Winkler H. Fischer-Colbrie R. Neuroscience. 1992; 49: 497-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar), to form a heterodimer at pH 7.5 and a heterotetramer (CGA2CGB2) at pH 5.5 (22.Yoo S.H. Lewis M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17041-17046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, tetrameric CGA has been shown to bind four molecules of an intraluminal loop peptide of the IP3R (23.Yoo S.H. Lewis M.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), suggesting the interaction of tetrameric CGA with tetrameric IP3R in the cell. In view of the facts that different types of the IP3R interact with each other to form heterotetrameric IP3R/Ca2+channel (9.Monkawa T. Miyawaki A. Sugiyama T. Yoneshima H. Yamamoto-Hino M. Furuich T.

J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23310-23316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and that CGA and CGB bind each other to form heterotetrameric CGA2CGB2 complex (22.Yoo S.H. Lewis M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17041-17046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), it appears very likely that homo- or heterotetrameric chromogranin complex interacts with homo- or heterotetrameric IP3R/Ca2+ channel in the secretory granule, thereby providing the basis for different degrees of IP3-induced Ca2+ release responses in the cells (24.Muallem S. Pandol S.J. Beeker T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 205-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Meyer T. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Like chromogranin A, chromogranin B has also been known to undergo pH- and Ca2+-dependent conformational changes (27.Yoo S, H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12578-12583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and it binds to the secretory granule membrane with significantly higher affinity than CGA (28.Yoo S.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8680-8686Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In light of the biochemical data suggesting the interaction of IP3R/Ca2+ channel with CGA (14.Yoo S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12001-12006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Yoo S.H. Lewis M.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), it was not clear whether purified intact IP3R and CGA interact directly and whether IP3R can interact with CGB. We have hence used purified IP3R to test its interaction with chromogranins A and B, and also used immunogold cytochemical methods to determine the presence of the IP3Rs in the adrenal chromaffin cells. Co-transfection of the IP3R and CGA or CGB into COS-7 cells followed by co-immunoprecipitation study demonstrated the existence of the IP3R-chromogranin complexes. IP3R peptides specific to terminal 10–13 amino acids of type I (HPPHMNVNPQQPA), type II (SNTPHENHHMPPA) and type III (FVDVQNCMSR) were synthesized with a carboxyl-terminal cysteine and anti-rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised as described for the IP3R antibody reactive with all three types of IP3R (14.Yoo S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12001-12006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine cerebella were mixed with three volumes of buffer A (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.32 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10 μm leupeptin, and 10 μm pepstatin) and were broken into small pieces in a blender, followed by homogenization in a glass-Teflon homogenizer. The homogenates were then centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were recentrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h to precipitate the membrane pellet. The pellet was resuspended in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10 μm leupeptin, and 10 μm pepstatin) containing 1% Triton X-100 to give the membrane protein concentration of approximately 2 mg/ml. The membrane solution was stirred for 1 h and then centrifuged at 32,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant obtained was mixed with an equal volume of buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10 μm leupeptin, and 10 μm pepstatin) and applied to an IP3R antibody-coupled immunoaffinity column (0.35 × 1 cm) equilibrated with buffer C. The IP3R antibody-coupled column was prepared by coupling 0.6 mg of affinity-purified anti-peptide IP3R antibody (14.Yoo S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12001-12006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) either to 1.2 ml of the immobilized protein A resin from the ImmunoPure protein A IgG orientation kit (Pierce) or to 0.2 g of CNBr-activated Sepharose according to the method described previously (14.Yoo S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12001-12006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and stored in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.02% sodium azide until use. The protein-loaded column was washed with 20 bed volumes of buffer C to remove unbound proteins, and the IP3R was eluted by 10 ml of elution buffer (0.1 m glycine, pH 2.8, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10 μm leupeptin, and 10 μm pepstatin). The eluate was immediately neutralized by adding 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, and mixed with an equal volume of buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.5 m NaCl, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and then applied to a benzamidine-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer D to remove any residual proteases from the IP3R sample. The IP3R containing flow-through was collected and stored at −70 °C until use. The purified bovine cerebellum IP3R bound approximately 320 pmol of IP3/mg of protein, which is comparable to other purified IP3Rs (6.Supattapone S. Worley P.F. Baraban J.M. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1530-1534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,7.Maeda N. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), as determined according to the published method (7.Maeda N. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). To construct GST fusion proteins, bovine CGA cDNA (29.Kang Y.K. Yoo S.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and CGB cDNA (30.Yoo S.H. Kang Y.K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 259-262Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into vector pGEX-5T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST-CGA and GST-CGB fusion proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli BL21 cells and were purified on glutathione-agarose beads. The binding reactions were carried out either in a pH 5.5 buffer (20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 0.1 m KCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100) or in a pH 7.5 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m KCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100), and the interaction was determined by incubating an excess amount of purified GST-CGA or CGB fusion protein (20 μg) with the purified IP3R (0.5–0.7 μg) in 0.5 ml of buffer supplemented with 1 × protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h at 4 °C. After incubation, the reaction mixture was washed six times with 1.5 ml of buffer to remove unbound proteins. Elution of the bound IP3R was carried out by using three bed volumes of the pH 7.5 buffer but with 1 mKCl. The eluted IP3R was resolved on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and was identified either by chemiluminescence-based immunoblot analysis using the affinity-purified IP3R antibody (14.Yoo S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12001-12006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by Coomassie Blue staining of the eluted protein. Tissue samples from bovine adrenal medulla were fixed overnight at 4 °C in PBS containing 1% glutaraldehyde and 1% paraformaldehyde. After three washes in PBS, the tissues were postfixed in PBS containing 1% osmium tetroxide on ice for 1 h, dehydrated in an ethanol series, and embedded in epoxy resin. Thin sections were collected on Formvar/carbon-coated nickel grids, which were then floated on drops of freshly prepared 3% sodium metaperiodate (31.Murphy S.M. Pilowsky P.M. Llewellyn-Smith I.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 1261-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) for 20 min. After etching, all grids were first washed in distilled water and in three successive 50-μl droplets of solution A (20 mm lysine in PBS), solution B (0.1% gelatin in PBS), and PBTT (PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.1% Triton X-100). Grids were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature in a humidified chamber on 25-μl droplets of primary antibody diluted in PBTT, followed by rinses in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, and in PBTT. After rinses, the grids were reacted with 10-nm gold conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (British BioCell International, United Kingdom) diluted in PBTT. Controls for the specificity of IP3R and chromogranin immunogold labeling included 1) omitting the primary antibody, and 2) replacing the primary antibody with preimmune serum. The grids were washed in PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20, followed by PBS and distilled water washes. The grids were then stained with uranyl acetate and lead nitrate, and were viewed with a Zeiss EM 912 electron microscope. For double immunolabeling of the isolated secretory granules, the secretory granules were embedded in LR White resin and polymerized as usual. Thin sections were collected on Formvar/carbon-coated nickel grids. The grids were processed through solution A, solution B, and PBTT as described above. For double immunolabeling, the anti-rabbit IP3R antibody and monoclonal anti-mouse CGA antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were used as first and second primary antibodies. The other procedures are the same as above. The full-length cDNA for bovine IP3R type I (S. H. Yoo, M. K. Kang, Y. S. Oh, U. J. Yun, S. H. Hong, and Y. K. Kang, GenBank™ accession no.AF157625) was subcloned into the vector pcDNA 3.1(+) and tagged with hemagglutinin A (HA) to create recombinant plasmid pc-b1. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The pc-b1 was co-transfected into COS-7 cells along with either CGA expressing pCI-CGA, or CGB expressing pCI-CGB. Expression of IP3R-1 as well as CGA or CGB in COS-7 cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). To perform co-immunoprecipitation experiments, the IP3R- and chromogranin-transfected cells were lysed with a pH 5.5 buffer (20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 0.1m KCl, and 1% Triton X-100), and the cell lysates were precleaned by incubation with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 22,000 × g for 5 min. Immunoprecipitation with HA antibody was performed by incubating 200 μl (0.5 mg/ml) of cell lysates with 1 μl (0.4 mg/ml) of monoclonal anti-mouse HA antibody on ice for 1 h. The cell lysates were then incubated for 1 additional h after the addition of 15 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein A-Sepharose in the pH 5.5 buffer. The complexes were pelleted by centrifuging at 3,500 × g for 1 min, and the immunoprecipitates were washed three times with the pH 5.5 buffer. Immunoprecipitation with CGA or CGB antibody was performed by incubating the cell lysates with 10 μl (1 mg/ml) of CGA or CGB antibody following the procedure described above. To determine whether the IP3R interacts with CGA or CGB directly, the IP3R was immuno-affinity-purified from bovine cerebellum using the affinity-purified anti-peptide IP3R antibody (14.Yoo S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12001-12006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). The purified IP3R was mostly type I as determined by Western blot using type I-specific anti-peptide IP3R antibodies (Fig.1 B). To determine direct interaction between the purified IP3R and CGA or CGB, GST-fusion forms of CGA and CGB were expressed inE. coli BL21, and purified to study their interactions with the IP3R. The interaction between the IP3R and GST-CGA and -CGB fusion proteins was examined at pH 5.5 and 7.5 in the presence and absence of Ca2+ (Fig.2). As shown in Fig. 2, CGA interacted with the IP3R at pH 5.5 regardless of the presence of Ca2+. CGB also interacted with the IP3R at pH 5.5, but unlike CGA, which failed to interact with the IP3R at pH 7.5 (Fig. 2 A), CGB still interacted with the IP3R at pH 7.5 regardless of the presence of Ca2+ albeit at a significantly reduced degree (Fig.2 B), reflecting a stronger affinity of CGB for the IP3R. To determine the location of the IP3Rs in the adrenal medullary chromaffin cells, immunogold cytochemistry was carried out with bovine adrenal medulla using the IP3R-specific antianti-body (14.Yoo S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12001-12006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 3, the IP3R-reacting gold particles were localized in the secretory granules, more than half of the gold particles localizing in the periphery of secretory granules. Fig. 3 shows that IP3R is also present in the endoplasmic reticulum but not in the mitochondria, which is in line with the known presence of IP3Rs in the endoplasmic reticulum but not in the mitochondria. To ensure that the IP3R antibody used in the immunogold cytochemical study react specifically with the IP3R on the secretory granule membrane, the secretory granule membrane proteins, which had been extracted as described before (14.Yoo S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12001-12006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were separated on a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to immunoblot analysis using the IP3R antibody (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4, the IP3R antibody reacted exclusively with a 260-kDa membrane protein, suggesting that the IP3R antibody used in the present study specifically reacted with the IP3R among the secretory granule membrane proteins. To further demonstrate the co-existence of IP3R and CGA in the secretory granules of chromaffin cells, the secretory granules were immunogold-labeled with both CGA and IP3R antibodies (Fig.5). As shown in Fig. 5, the co-localization experiments clearly demonstrated the presence of both the IP3R and CGA in the secretory granules (Fig.5 A), indicating co-existence of these molecules in the secretory granules. To determine whether the IP3R and chromogranins A and B are physically linked in the cells, the IP3R and CGA or CGB were co-transfected into COS-7 cells and co-immunoprecipitation was carried out. As shown in Fig. 6, immunoprecipitation of the cell extracts, which had been co-transfected with IP3R-1 and CGA, by monoclonal HA antibody and immunoblot analysis by CGA and HA antibodies (Fig. 6 A) indicated the co-precipitation of CGA and IP3R-1. Further, immunoprecipitation of the same cell extracts with CGA antibody and immunoblot analysis by IP3R-1 and CGA antibodies (Fig.6 B) also indicated the co-precipitation of CGA and IP3R-1, thus clearly demonstrating the complex formation between the IP3R and CGA in the cells. Likewise, immunoprecipitation of the cell extracts, which had been co-transfected with IP3R-1 and CGB, by monoclonal HA antibody and immunoblot analysis by CGB and HA antibodies (Fig.7 A) indicated the co-precipitation of CGB and IP3R-1. Immunoprecipitation of the same cell extracts with CGB antibody and immunoblotting by IP3R-1 and CGB antibodies (Fig. 7 B) also indicated the co-precipitation of CGB and IP3R-1, again demonstrating the complex formation between the IP3R and CGB.Figure 7Co-immunoprecipitation of IP3R-1 with CGB. A, protein extracts from COS-7 cells that had been cotransfected with HA-tagged IP3R-1 and CGB were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal HA antibody, and were immunoblotted with monoclonal anti-CGB antibody (upper panel) and monoclonal HA antibody (lower panel), respectively. B, the same extracts were immunoprecipitated with CGB antibody and immunoblotted with monoclonal HA antibody (upper panel) and CGB antibody (lower panel). Preimmune IgG (P) was used as control antibody (lane 1). 260-kDa IP3R was co-immunoprecipitated with 105-kDa CGB.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The original study that demonstrated the IP3-induced Ca2+ release from secretory granules has been done with the chromaffin granules of adrenal medullary chromaffin cells (1.Yoo S.H. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13446-13448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, further demonstration of IP3-induced Ca2+ release from secretory granules had not been successfully done until Petersen and colleagues (2.Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Belan P.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1996; 84: 473-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) showed IP3-mediated Ca2+ release from the zymogen granules 6 years later, supporting the concept of secretory granules of endocrine and neuroendocrine cells serving as the IP3-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ store (1.Yoo S.H. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13446-13448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Blondel O. Bell G.I. Seino S. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 157-161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The virtual absence of similar studies during this period seemed to reflect the difficulty associated with this kind of study rather than lack of efforts by other researchers, as others who have attempted same kind of experiments failed to obtain similar results (33.Yule D.I. Ernst S.A. Ohnishi H. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9093-9098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Recently, additional evidence indicating direct participation of secretory granule calcium in the control of cytoplasmic Ca2+ has been obtained in the secretory granules of goblet cells (3.Nguyen T. Chin W.-C. Verdugo P. Nature. 1998; 395: 908-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar); the uptake of Ca2+ by secretory granules was temporally and spatially matched by simultaneous reduction of Ca2+ concentration in the surrounding cytoplasm, whereas IP3-mediated release of Ca2+ by secretory granules resulted in the simultaneous increase of cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration in the immediate vicinity of the secretory granules, clearly demonstrating the active participation of secretory granules in the control of cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration. Although the discovery that the secretory granule of adrenal medullary chromaffin cells is a major IP3-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ store (1.Yoo S.H. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13446-13448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) implied the presence of IP3R on the secretory granule membrane, the presence of IP3R on the secretory granule membrane was not addressed until the intravesicular matrix protein CGA was shown to interact with several integral membrane proteins of secretory granules including the IP3R (14.Yoo S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12001-12006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which was the first example demonstrating a physical coupling between an ion channel and a cognate ion storage protein. Chromogranins are widely distributed in neurons, endocrine cells, and neuroendocrine cells, and they are known to be marker proteins of neuroendocrine cells (21.Winkler H. Fischer-Colbrie R. Neuroscience. 1992; 49: 497-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 34.Iacangelo A.L. Eiden L.E. Regul. Pept. 1995; 58: 65-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 35.Simon J.-P.

Sci. 1991; 16: 27-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). In the secretory granules of bovine adrenal chromaffin cells, chromogranins, which are present in the 1–2 mm range (35.Simon J.-P. Aunis D. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 37.Winkler H. Westhead E. Neuroscience. 1980; 5: 1803-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), bind ATP (38.Yoo S.H. Albanesi J.P. Jameson D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1040: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), catecholamine (39.Videen J.S. Mezger M.S. Chang Y.-M. O'Connor D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3066-3073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Ca2+ (40.Bulenda D. Gratzl M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7760-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 41.Reiffen F.U. Gratzl M. FEBS Lett. 1986; 195: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Chromogranin A binds 32 mol of Ca2+/mol with dissociation constant of 2.7 mmat pH 7.5, and 55 mol of Ca2+/mol with dissociation constant of 4 mm at pH 5.5 (4.Yoo S.H. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7740-7745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Due to the high capacity Ca2+ binding property of chromogranins, most (>99.9%) of 40 mm intravesicular calcium stay bound to chromogranins, resulting in the free Ca2+ concentration of only 24 μm (40.Bulenda D. Gratzl M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7760-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In view of the fact that the secretory granules occupy approximately 10% of bovine chromaffin cell volume (37.Winkler H. Westhead E. Neuroscience. 1980; 5: 1803-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), the calcium storage capacity of the secretory granules must be playing key roles in the overall control of calcium in the cells. In this regard, the high capacity, low affinity Ca2+ binding property of chromogranins proves to be essential, enabling the secretory granules to store an exceptionally large amount of Ca2+. It appears therefore very evident that the secretory granules should play pivotal roles in controlling the intracellular Ca2+concentrations. Despite the possibility that the IP3R antibody used in one study (15.Blondel O. Moody M.M. Depaoli A.M. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Swift H. Bell G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7777-7781Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) might have interacted with insulins in the secretory granules of pancreatic β-cells, this should not obscure the important observation that the secretory granules of pancreatic acinar-cells release Ca2+ in response to IP3 (2.Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Belan P.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1996; 84: 473-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In addition, the affinity-purified IP3R antibodies used in the present study did not interact with catecholamines (results not shown). The antibody reacted specifically with a 260-kDa secretory vesicle membrane protein (Fig. 4), whose mass is in line with that of IP3Rs, indicating the specificity of the IP3R antibody used in the immunogold study (Figs. 3 and 5). This is further strengthened by the observation that gold-labeled IP3R antibody appeared to interact specifically with the antigens in the secretory granules and the endoplasmic reticulum the established location of IP3R existence, but not in the mitochondria (Fig. 3). Results in Figs. 3 and 5 show that more than half of the gold-labeled IP3R antibody localized in the periphery of the secretory granules. Therefore, the immunogold cytochemical study reported in the present study appears to unequivocally demonstrate the existence of the IP3Rs in the secretory granules of chromaffin cells. Although IP3R monomers can bind IP3, they do not exist in a monomeric state in the cell; instead, four molecules of same or different types of IP3R interact with each other to form either homotetrameric or heterotetrameric IP3R (6.Supattapone S. Worley P.F. Baraban J.M. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1530-1534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Maeda N. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23310-23316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), forming a Ca2+ channel. Interestingly, CGA is also known to form a dimer at the near physiological pH 7.5 and a tetramer at the intravesicular pH 5.5 (19.Yoo S.H. Lewis M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11236-11241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, chromogranins A and B together form a CGA-CGB heterodimer at pH 7.5 but a CGA2CGB2 heterotetramer at pH 5.5 (22.Yoo S.H. Lewis M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17041-17046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown previously that tetrameric CGA interacts with four molecules of intraluminal loop peptide of IP3R (23.Yoo S.H. Lewis M.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), thus implying the interaction between tetrameric chromogranin and tetrameric IP3R. In this regard, direct interaction between the IP3R and Ca2+ storage proteins CGA and CGB, as shown in Fig. 2, sheds new light on the physiological significance of this coupling between tetrameric chromogranin and tetrameric IP3R in the secretory granules. Therefore, the results showing the localization of the IP3R on the secretory granule membranes (Figs. 3 and 5) and the direct interaction between the purified IP3R and CGA or CGB (Fig. 2), combined with the co-immunoprecipitation of transfected IP3R and CGA or CGB (Figs. 6 and 7), strongly suggest the importance of this coupling in fine-tuning the intracellular Ca2+ control mechanisms in the cell. IP3 binding to the IP3R has been known to cause conformational changes of the IP3R (42.Mignery G.A. Südhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Further, it has been shown that CGA assumes different conformations in different pH environment (18.Yoo S.H. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14414-14421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that CGA in different conformation exhibits different Ca2+-binding capacity and affinity (4.Yoo S.H. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7740-7745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In light of these observations, it is natural to think that the conformational changes of the IP3R that occur as a result of IP3 binding will be transmitted instantly to the coupled CGA and CGB in the secretory granules, causing their conformational changes. It may then be assumed that the resulting conformational changes in CGA and CGB will concomitantly result in lowering of chromogranins' affinity for Ca2+, thus freeing some Ca2+ from the proteins and making them available for release through the IP3R channel to the cytoplasm. Furthermore, in view of the fact that the secretory granules contain up to 40 mm Ca2+ and most (>99.9%) of it remains bound to chromogranins in the secretory granule (40.Bulenda D. Gratzl M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7760-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), the coupling of calcium storage proteins to the IP3R/Ca2+ channel appears to reflect the efficient and intricate structural organization of an intracellular Ca2+ store whose Ca2+ storage/release function should be strictly and subtly controlled in order for the Ca2+ store to respond appropriately to the changing cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations. Moreover, the insight into the molecular organization of Ca2+ control mechanism of secretory granules is certain to shed further light on the elucidation of Ca2+ storage/release mechanisms of other intracellular Ca2+ stores. Given the physiological needs of cells to tightly control the cellular Ca2+, the physical coupling of Ca2+ storage proteins to Ca2+ channels seemed to be a natural consequence. Despite the seemingly intricate and tight structural organization inside the IP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores as demonstrated in the present results, the amount of Ca2+ released in response to a fixed amount of IP3 varies widely in the cells (24.Muallem S. Pandol S.J. Beeker T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 205-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Meyer T. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3841-3845Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 26.Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Taylor C.W. J. Physiol. 1992; 450: 163-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), probably due to multiple reasons. In the case of secretory granules, the amount of Ca2+ to be released in response to IP3 will be determined by a combination of several factors, i.e. the IP3 concentration introduced, the nature of tetrameric IP3R channels formed, the types of chromogranins coupled to the IP3R channel, and the Ca2+ charge states of coupled chromogranins."

We mutated all non-cysteine residues in CTx MI, expressed the α2βδ2 pentameric form of the AChR in 293 human embryonic kidney cells, and measured binding of the mutant toxins by competition against the initial rate of125I-α-bungarotoxin binding. The CTx MI mutations P6G, A7V, G9S, and Y12T all decrease affinity for α2βδ2 pentamers by 10,000-fold. Side chains at these four positions localize to a restricted region of the known three-dimensional structure of CTx MI. Mutations of the AChR reveal major contributions to CTx MI affinity by Tyr-198 in the α subunit and by the selectivity determinants Ser-36, Tyr-113, and Ile-178 in the δ subunit. By using double mutant cycles analysis, we find that Tyr-12 of CTx MI interacts strongly with all three selectivity determinants in the δ subunit and that δSer-36 and δIle-178 are interdependent in stabilizing Tyr-12. We find additional strong interactions between Gly-9 and Pro-6 in CTx MI and selectivity determinants in the δ subunit, and between Ala-7 and Pro-6 and Tyr-198 in the α subunit. The overall results reveal the orientation of CTx MI when bound to the α-δ interface and show that primarily hydrophobic interactions stabilize the complex.

By identifying multiple pairwise interactions, these studies define dimensions of the active site according to the known structure of the toxin. The studies also establish the underlying basis for molecular recognition in high affinity protein complexes. Here we probe the muscle AChR1 with the peptide toxin α-conotoxin MI and use double mutant cycles analysis to identify pairs of residues that confer the nanomolar affinity of the complex. Mutagenesis and site-directed labeling studies establish that the ligand binding sites of the muscle AChR are formed at interfaces between α1 and either δ, ε, or γ subunits (7.Prince R.J. Sine S.M. Barrantes F.J. The Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor: Current Views and Future Trends. Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX1997: 31-59Google Scholar, 8.Tsigelny I. Sugiyama N. Sine S.M. Taylor P. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 52-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Residues on the α1 face of the binding site are found in three well separated regions of the primary sequence, termed loops A, B, and C. Using the numbering system for the mouse α1subunit, key residues in these loops include Tyr-93 in loop A, Trp-149 in loop B, and Tyr-190 and Tyr-198 in loop C. Similarly, residues on the non-α face of the binding site are found in four well separated regions of the primary sequence, termed loops I through IV. Using the numbering system for the mouse δ subunit, key residues in these loops include Ser-36 in loop I, Trp-57 in loop II, Tyr-113 in loop III, and Ile-178 in loop IV. The observation that these seven loops converge to form a localized binding site has led to a multi-loop model of the major extracellular domain of the AChR (8.Tsigelny I. Sugiyama N. Sine S.M. Taylor P. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 52-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). α-Conotoxins are small, disulfide-rich peptides that competitively inhibit muscle and neuronal nicotinic AChRs (9.McIntosh J.M. Santos A.D. Olivera B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). All α-conotoxins have a conformationally constrained two-loop structure formed by two disulfide bridges. However, the various α-conotoxins differ by the number and type of residues in each loop, allowing specific targeting of receptor subtypes. α-Conotoxins specific for muscle AChRs include MI, GI, and SI, and contain three residues in the first loop and five in the second (Fig. 1). Muscle-specific α-conotoxins can be further subdivided according to their ability to select between the two AChR binding sites; CTx MI and GI select between the two binding sites by 10,000-fold, whereas CTx SI selects between the sites by 100-fold (10.Sine S.M. Kreienkamp H.-J. Bren N. Maeda R. Taylor P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 11.Groebe D. Gray W. Abramson S.

Moreover, CTx MI binds to the α-δ site of the muscle AChR with nanomolar affinity and stays bound for more than 6 h (13.Prince R.J. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19623-19629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Their site selectivity and exceedingly high affinity make CTx MI and GI powerful probes of the structure of the muscle AChR binding site. Residues from both α and non-α faces of the AChR binding site stabilize bound CTx MI and include residues from four of the seven loops. The α face contributes Tyr-198 and Tyr-190 from loop C (14.Sugiyama N. Marchot P. Kawanishi C. Osaka H. Molles B. Sine S. Taylor P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), whereas the δ face contributes Ser-36 from loop I, Tyr-113 from loop III, and Ile-178 from loop IV (10.Sine S.M. Kreienkamp H.-J. Bren N. Maeda R. Taylor P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Selectivity of CTx MI for the two AChR binding sites owes to residue differences in δ and γ subunits at these three positions and can be transferred from one binding site to the other by exchanging residues at these key positions. That both α and non-α subunits contribute to CTx MI binding suggests that the toxin bridges the subunit interface, whereas the modular exchangeability across γ and δ subunits suggests the key residues contribute directly to CTx MI binding. By mutating residues in both the AChR and CTx MI, the present work further tests the hypothesis that the toxin bridges the binding site interface. We use double mutant cycles analysis to distinguish interacting from non-interacting pairs of residues in the complex. We find that CTx MI interacts with the α-δ site of the AChR through four hydrophobic residues in its N- and C-terminal loops. Furthermore, the key side chains in CTx MI localize in a hydrophobic cluster that interacts with hydrophobic and aromatic residues from both the α and δ subunits. α-Conotoxin MI was purchased from American Peptide Company; 293 human embryonic kidney cell line (293 HEK) and BOSC 23 HEK cell line were from the American Type Culture Collection;125I-labeled α-bungarotoxin was from NEN Life Science Products; d-tubocurarine chloride was from ICN Pharmaceuticals; and 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid was from Sigma. Wild type and mutant α-conotoxin MI were synthesized by standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry on an Applied Biosystems 431A peptide synthesizer. Cysteine protecting groups (S-triphenylmethyl) were incorporated during synthesis at cysteines 4 and 14, and acetamidomethyl-protecting groups (ACM) were incorporated at cysteines 3 and 8. The linear peptide was purified by a reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography using a Vydac C18 preparative column with trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile buffer. The two disulfide bridges were formed as follows: the cysteineS-triphenylmethyl-protecting groups of cysteines 4 and 14 were removed during trifluoroacetic acid cleavage of the linear peptide from the support resin, and the peptide was oxidized by molecular oxygen to form the 4–14 disulfide bond by stirring in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.5, at 25 °C for 24 h. The peptide was lyophilized and then the second bridge was formed as follows: the ACM-protecting groups on cysteines 3 and 8 were removed oxidatively by iodine as described (15.Andrue D. Albericio F. Solé N.A. Munson M.C. Ferrer M. Barany G. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 35: 139-140Google Scholar), except the peptide/iodine reaction was allowed to progress for 16 h prior to carbon tetrachloride extraction. Residual iodine was separated from the pure product by high performance liquid chromatography. The purified product was verified by mass spectrometry (Table I). The CTx MI mutants are named as follows: the first letter and number refer to the wild type residue and position, and the following letter is the substituted residue at that position.Table IMolecular weights and oxidation states of wild type and mutant α-conotoxinsConotoxinObservedM rCalculated M r% AbsNon-oxidized CTx MI100CTx MI2.5Acetylated G11536.01540.01.4R2Q1465.01465.01.4H5A1428.01430.01.9P6G1454.01453.01.8P6A1467.01467.01.4P6I1509.51510.01.8P6V1495.51497.02.1G9A1494.21498.32.6G9S1494.51497.22.9G9V1472.21474.42.7A7V1466.21467.62.2A7S1467.31468.52.2K10Q1495.01499.02.6K10Y1532.01535.02.1N11K1509.01509.01.7Y12T1432.01432.72.0Y12F1478.01478.03.2S13A1493.01493.02.1S13V1494.01495.02.2Molecular weight was determined by mass spectrometry and compared to the calculated molecular weight.

The percent absorbance (% Abs) is the reactivity of each α-conotoxin to DTNB relative to that of linear, non-oxidized α-conotoxin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Commerically available CTx MI is included for comparison. To confirm disulfide bond formation, we compared reactions with Ellman's reagent for linear, non-oxidized CTx MI, commercially available CTx MI, and all of our synthetic CTx MI mutants. For each conotoxin, 100 μg was dissolved in 200 μl of 0.1m phosphate buffer; 4 μl of 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid was added, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The absorbance at 405 nm was measured. Reactivity for each synthetic mutant is expressed relative to that obtained for the non-oxidized, linear CTx MI (Table I). Mouse AChR subunit cDNAs were subcloned into the cytomegalovirus-based expression vector pRBG4 (16.Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). All mutations of the α subunit were constructed as described previously (17.Sine S.M. Quiram P. Papanikolaou F. Kreienkamp H.-J. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8808-8816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The single point mutations δS36K, δY113S, and δI178F, as well as the double mutant δ(S36K/δI178F) and triple mutant δ(S36K/δY113S/δI178F) were constructed as described (10.Sine S.M. Kreienkamp H.-J. Bren N. Maeda R. Taylor P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The double mutant δ(S36K/δY113S) was constructed by ligation of the 400-bp PflMI-PflMI fragment containing δY113S to the 5100-bpPflMI-PflMI fragment containing the mutation S36K. The double mutant δ(Y113S/δI178F) was constructed by ligation of the 400-bp PflMI-PflMI fragment containing δY113S with the 5100-bp PflMI-PflMI fragment containing δI178F. All constructs were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. Human embryonic kidney cells (293 HEK) were transfected with mutant or wild type subunit cDNAs using calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (16.Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). BOSC 23 HEK cells were used in some experiments with low expressing mutant AChRs. AChR subunit cDNAs were combined in the ratio 2:1:2 for α, β, and δ subunits, respectively. After 24 h at 37 °C, the transfected cells were incubated at 31 °C for an additional 48 h. Three days after transfection, intact cells were harvested by gentle agitation in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm EDTA. α-Conotoxin MI binding to intact cells was measured by competition against the initial rate of125I-labeled α-bungarotoxin (18.Sine S.M. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3315-3325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After harvesting, the cells were briefly centrifuged, resuspended in potassium Ringer's solution, and divided into aliquots for α-conotoxin binding measurements. Potassium Ringer solution contains 140 mmKCl, 5.4 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.7 mm MgCl2, 25 mm HEPES, and 30 mg/liter bovine serum albumin adjusted to pH 7.4 with 10 mmNaOH. Specified concentrations of α-conotoxin were added 60 min prior to the addition of 125I-α-bungarotoxin, which was allowed to occupy approximately half the surface receptors. Binding was terminated by the addition of 2 ml of potassium Ringer's solution containing 600 μm d-tubocurarine chloride. Cells were harvested through Whatman GF-B filters using a Brandel cell harvester and washed three times with 3 ml of potassium Ringer's solution. Prior to use, the filters were soaked in potassium Ringer's solution containing 4% skim milk for 2 h. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 300 μm d-tubocurarine. The total number of α-bungarotoxin sites was determined by incubation with radiolabeled toxin for 120 min. The initial rate of toxin binding was calculated as described previously to yield the fractional occupancy of the ligand (18.Sine S.M. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3315-3325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding measurements were analyzed according to the Hill equation: 1 − Y = 1/(1 +([ligand]/K app)n H), where Y is the fractional occupancy of the ligand,K app is the apparent dissociation constant, andn H is the Hill coefficient. For determinations from single experiments, fitted parameters and standard errors were obtained using the program Ultrafit (BIOSOFT). For multiple experiments, means ± S.D. of the individual fitted parameters are presented (Tables II and III).Table IIBinding parameters for CTx MI mutationsK appn HnnmWT CTx MI0.94 ± 0.090.70 ± 0.0230Acetyl-G16.39 ± 0.150.70 ± 0.072R2Q24.21 ± 7.020.80 ± 0.069H5A15.03 ± 5.040.82 ± 0.067P6G7991.02 ± 548.041.30 ± 0.129P6I10550.03 ± 300.261.01 ± 0.052P6A408.15 ± 23.310.91 ± 0.062P6V802.33 ± 14.421.10 ± 0.021A7V6419.24 ± 1239.170.97 ± 0.119A7S46.16 ± 2.440.76 ± 0.043G9A1390.07 ± 239.350.78 ± 0.061G9S4827.32 ± 832.110.82 ± 0.077K10Q27.41 ± 4.190.83 ± 0.097K10Y277.32 ± 28.341.11 ± 0.263N11K28.27 ± 6.100.85 ± 0.087Y12T9902.19 ± 690.341.10 ± 0.0420Y12F2.42 ± 0.340.82 ± 0.081S13A24.16 ± 2.230.92 ± 0.031S13V48.22 ± 3.140.77 ± 0.041Values are the least squares fit to the Hill equation;K app is the apparent dissociation constant;n H is the Hill coefficient, and n is the number of independent experiments.

Mutations of CTx MI were generated by standard peptide synthesis methods as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Molecular weight and the presence of two disulfide bonds were verified by mass spectrometry and by negative reaction with Ellman's reagent (Table I). Because CTx MI binds 10,000-fold more tightly to the α-δ than to the α-γ interface of the AChR (10.Sine S.M. Kreienkamp H.-J. Bren N. Maeda R. Taylor P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), we measured CTx MI binding to the α2βδ2 pentameric form of the AChR expressed on the surface of 293 HEK cells. As measured by competition against the initial rate of 125I-α-bungarotoxin binding, our synthetic CTx MI bound with a K d of 0.94 nm (Table II) and was indistinguishable from commercially available CTx MI. We mutated all non-cysteines in CTx MI and measured binding of each mutant conotoxin to α2βδ2 pentamers. Our mutagenic scan of CTx MI reveals four residues essential for high affinity binding as follows: Ala-7 and Pro-6 in the N-terminal loop and Tyr-12 and Gly-9 in the C-terminal loop (Fig.2; Table II). Within the N-terminal loop, mutation of Ala-7 to valine decreases affinity nearly 10,000-fold, whereas mutation to serine decreases affinity by 50-fold (Table II), indicating that position 7 requires a side chain that is both small and hydrophobic. Mutation of the adjacent Pro-6 to glycine decreases affinity nearly 10,000-fold, whereas mutation to alanine or valine decreases affinity 400- and 800-fold, respectively, suggesting the need for both restricted rotation of the peptide backbone and hydrophobic contributions at position 6. Within the C-terminal loop of CTx MI, mutation of Tyr-12 to threonine decreases affinity 10,000-fold, whereas mutation to phenylalanine maintains high affinity (Table II), indicating a purely aromatic contribution at position 12. Mutation of Gly-9 to alanine decreases affinity 1400-fold, whereas mutation to serine decreases affinity 5000-fold, indicating a nearly absolute requirement for glycine, which is small and can accommodate unique combinations of φ and ψ bond angles (19.Gouda H. Yamazaki K. Hasagawa J. Kobayashi Y. Nishiuchi Y. Sakakibara S. Hirono S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1343: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the mutants acetyl-G1 and K10Q, which neutralize positive charges previously thought to be essential for CTx MI bioactivity (11.Groebe D. Gray W. Abramson S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6469-6474Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar,12.Hann R.M. Pagan O.R. Eterovic V.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14058-14063Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), produce relatively small changes in affinity (Fig. 2). The overall mutagenesis results reveal four energetically equivalent sources of high affinity in CTx MI, making them potential points of interaction with the α-δ binding site. The four bioactive residues of CTx MI map to a restricted region of its three-dimensional structure (Fig. 3; Ref.19.Gouda H. Yamazaki K. Hasagawa J. Kobayashi Y. Nishiuchi Y. Sakakibara S. Hirono S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1343: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), indicating that the contact surface at the ligand binding site is likely to be small and complementary to the active region of the toxin. Side chains of the bioactive residues occupy corners of an irregular trapezoid 6.4 to 8.0 Å long and 3.9 to 6.6 Å wide, creating a hydrophobic patch in an otherwise hydrophilic peptide. The ring structures of Pro-6 and Tyr-12 stack parallel to each other, whereas Ala-7 protrudes at right angles to Pro-6, and the methylene α-carbon of Gly-9 leaves a pronounced cavity rimmed by hydrophobic side chains. Thus bioactivity of CTx MI owes to a three-fingered hydrophobic structure at one end of the toxin. Aromatic residues in the AChR α subunit are widely recognized to contribute to ligand affinity (7.Prince R.J. Sine S.M. Barrantes F.J. The Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor: Current Views and Future Trends. Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX1997: 31-59Google Scholar). We therefore examined the key aromatic residues, Tyr-93, Tyr-190, Tyr-198, Trp-149, and Tyr-151, as potential points of interaction with CTx MI. The mutation αY198T decreases affinity 1000-fold, whereas αY190T decreases affinity 30-fold (Fig.4; TableIII). These results, obtained in symmetric α2βδ2 pentamers, are similar to those described for the α-δ site in asymmetric α2βγδ pentamers (14.Sugiyama N. Marchot P. Kawanishi C. Osaka H. Molles B. Sine S. Taylor P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Mutation of the remaining aromatic residues, αTyr-93, αTrp-149, and αTyr-151, only weakly affects affinity. Thus αTyr-198 and αTyr-190 are candidates for interaction with CTx MI. Previous work (10.Sine S.M. Kreienkamp H.-J. Bren N. Maeda R. Taylor P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) showed that residue differences at three equivalent positions of the γ and δ subunits confer the 10,000-fold selectivity of CTx MI for the α-δ over the α-γ interface of the AChR. We therefore re-examined these selectivity determinants as potential points of interaction with CTx MI. Single point mutations of the selectivity determinants, δS36K, δY113S, and δI178F, produce only modest changes in affinity for CTx MI (Fig. 5; Table III). However, when S36K and I178F are combined into a single δ subunit, affinity for CTx MI decreases considerably more than with either mutation alone (Fig. 5), indicating that these residues are interdependent in stabilizing CTx MI (10.Sine S.M. Kreienkamp H.-J. Bren N. Maeda R. Taylor P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 14.Sugiyama N. Marchot P. Kawanishi C. Osaka H. Molles B. Sine S. Taylor P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The remaining combinations of double mutations, (S36K/Y113S) and (Y113S/I178F), produce roughly additive changes in affinity, indicating little interdependence of these selectivity determinants. When mutations of all three selectivity determinants are combined into a single δ subunit, CTx MI affinity falls 10,000-fold to that of low affinity α2βγ2 pentamers (Fig. 5). Thus all three selectivity determinants in the δ subunit are candidates for interaction with CTx MI. Thermodynamic double mutant cycles analysis has been widely used to identify noncovalent interactions between residues within a single protein and between residues joining different proteins (1.Hidalgo P. MacKinnon R. Science. 1995; 268: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 2.Naranjo D. Miller C.

To generate a mutant cycle for pairs of CTx MI and AChR mutations, dissociation constants are determined for the four possible combinations of wild type (W) and mutant (M) receptors (r) and conotoxins (t): WrWt, MrWt, WrMt, andMrMt. The resulting dissociation constants are then used to calculate a coupling coefficient Ω (20.Horowitz A. Fersht A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 613-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) shown in Equation 1,Ω=Kd (WrWt)·Kd (MrMt)Kd (WrMt)·Kd (MrWt)Equation 1 If Ω equals unity the pair of residues does not interact, whereas if Ω deviates from unity the pair of residues interacts. To identify pairs of interacting residues, we focus on residues in the AChR and CTx MI that significantly affect affinity of the complex and then apply double mutant cycles analysis to all possible pairs of receptor-conotoxin mutations. We find the strongest interaction between the triad of selectivity determinants in the δ subunit and Tyr-12 of CTx MI; binding curves for the corresponding mutant cycle are shown in Fig. 6 A. Individually, mutations in either the receptor or the conotoxin decrease affinity by 10,000-fold. However when mutations in both the receptor and conotoxin are examined together, affinity decreases by 100,000-fold, which is 3 orders of magnitude less than predicted if the contributions were additive. Double mutant cycles analysis reveals a coupling coefficient of 1584 for the δ(S36K + Y113S + I178F)/Y12T pair, corresponding to an interaction free energy of 4.3 kcal/mol (TableIV).Table IVOmega values from double mutant cycles analysisδS36K + I178FδS36K + Y113S + I178FδS36KδY113SδI178FαY198TαY190TαY93TR2Q4.012.62.11.62.020.01.01.0H5A1.61.62.52.05.08.01.34.0P6G126.080.01.03.22.0100.01.61.6A7V20.0316.01.61.32.0638.010.01.6G9S10.0126.01.04.02.53.02.01.0K10Q2.03.22.58.05.010.01.66.3N11K1.610.03.22.53.22.03.21.3Y12T126.01584.02.011.83.039.06.310.0 Open table in a new tab Whereas mutant cycles analysis can identify interacting pairs of residues, it can also identify non-interacting pairs of residues, as illustrated for the pair αY198T/N11K (Fig. 6 B). The receptor mutation αY198T decreases affinity by 1000-fold, whereas the CTx MI mutation N11K decreases affinity by 30-fold. When the two mutations are examined together, affinity decreases by 30,000-fold, which is purely additive, demonstrating that αTyr-198 and Asn-11 do not interact. Thus double mutant cycles analysis readily distinguishes interacting from non-interacting pairs of residues in the AChR-CTx MI complex. Applied to the α subunit face of the AChR binding site, mutant cycles analysis reveals that Tyr-198 interacts significantly with the bioactive residues Ala-7, Pro-6, and Tyr-12 in CTx MI (Fig.7 and Table IV). The coupling coefficient for the αY198T/A7V pair is 638 and corresponds to an interaction free energy of 3.8 kcal/mol. The αY198T/P6G pair exhibits a weaker coupling coefficient of 100, perhaps owing to reduction of a joint contact surface formed by Ala-7 and Pro-6 or to increased conformational flexibility of Ala-7 caused by the P6G mutation. The weaker coupling coefficient of 39 for the Y12T/αY198T pair is likely due to an indirect interaction in which the Y12T mutation produces global changes that propagate to either Ala-7 or Pro-6 (Fig. 3), both of which couple strongly to αTyr-198. Alternatively, the Y12T mutation may allow reorientation of the conotoxin due to loss of the interaction between Tyr-12 and the δ subunit (see Fig. 6 Abelow). The fourth bioactive residue in CTx MI, Gly-9, shows a conspicuous lack of coupling to any of the conserved tyrosines in the α subunit. The rank order of coupling to αTyr-198, Ala-7 > Pro-6 > Tyr-12 ≫ Gly-9, suggests that CTx MI binds with Ala-7 opposing Tyr-198 of the α subunit. Applied to the δ subunit face of the AChR binding site, m"

Similarly important is the generation of glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkers, which anchor membrane proteins to the cell. Both protein modifications depend on the central nucleotide sugar UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc). The enzymatic reactions leading to generation of nucleotide sugars are established, yet most of the respective genes still await cloning. We describe the characterization of such a gene, EMeg32, which we identified based on its differential expression in murine hematopoietic precursor cells. We further demonstrate regulated expression during embryogenesis. EMeg32 codes for a 184-amino acid protein exhibiting glucosamine-6-phosphate acetyltransferase activity. It thereby holds a key position in the pathway toward de novoUDP-GlcNAc synthesis. Surprisingly, the protein associates with the cytoplasmic side of various intracellular membranes, accumulates prior to mitosis, and copurifies with the cdc48 homolog p97/valosin-containing protein.

Maturation of the oligomannose precursor occurs during passage of the attached protein through cis-, medial, and trans-Golgi and is mediated by several trimming enzymes (e.g. mannosidases) and glycosyltransferases (for a review, see Ref. 2.Dennis J.W. Granovsky M. Warren C.E. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 412-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). At the basis of each N-linked carbohydrate isN-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), whose initial transfer to dolichol phosphate is achieved in the form of its nucleotide sugar donor UDP-GlcNAc. GlcNAc not only constitutes the first aminosugar residue linked to asparagine in all N-glycosylated proteins, but also serves as an important module in generating complex or hybridN-linked oligosaccharide structures as well asO-linked oligosaccharides (3.Murray R.K. Granner D.K. Mayes P.A. Rodwell V.W. Langan C. Harper's Biochemistry. 22nd Ed. Appleton & Lange, Norwalk, CT1990: 591-608Google Scholar). In addition, a number of proteoglycans contain GlcNAc linked to the respective core protein or other aminosugar residues. It also serves in generating glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) linkers, which are responsible for anchoring a variety of cell surface molecules to the plasma membrane (4.Ferguson M.A. Williams A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 285-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar, 5.Englund P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 121-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Udenfriend S. Kodukula K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The initial reaction of GPI assembly (the transfer of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to phosphatidylinositol) is uniformly distributed to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the ER (7.Vidugiriene J. Sharma D.K. Smith T.K. Baumann N.A. Menon A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15203-15212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Generation of UDP-GlcNAc is possible by both de novosynthesis and salvage pathways and the respective enzymes have been identified (for a review, see Ref. 8.Schachter H. Pigman D. Horowitz M.I. The Glycoconjugates. II. Academic Press, New York1978: 87-181Crossref Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells the sequence of intermediates is fructose 6-phosphate → glucosamine 6-phosphate → N-acetylglucosamine 6-phosphate →N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphate → UDP-GlcNAc. In addition, two alternative routes are described for generating UDP-GlcNAc. In one case, GlcNAc from degradation of nutritional constituents or from lysosomal degradation of oligosaccharide-moieties is phosphorylated byN-acetylglucosamine kinase (9.Hinderlich S. Nohring S. Weise C. Franke P. Stasche R. Reutter W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) to generateN-acetylglucosamine 6-phosphate. This then feeds into the pathway described above. The second route uses the sequence galactosamine → N-acetylgalactosamine 1-phosphate → UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine → UDP-GlcNAc (for a review, see Ref. 8.Schachter H. Pigman D. Horowitz M.I. The Glycoconjugates. II. Academic Press, New York1978: 87-181Crossref Google Scholar). It is not clear at present to which extent the redundancy in generating UDP-GlcNAc is employed by cells to respond to various extracellular stimuli, nor how the expression of the respective enzyme genes is regulated, because most of the corresponding cDNAs have not been cloned. We have recently developed a PCR-based approach to comprehensively analyze gene expression in rare normal murine hematopoietic precursor cells and have used this system to identify novel genes specific for certain precursor types (10.Brady G. Billia F. Knox J. Hoang T. Kirsch I.R. Voura E.B. Hawley R.G. Cumming R. Buchwald M. Siminovitch K. Miyamoto N. Boehmelt G. Iscove N.N. Curr.

We report here the cloning and characterization of a murine cDNA (EMeg32), which displayed a strong differential expression pattern in adult hematopoietic precursor cells. EMeg32encodes a protein of 184 amino acids exhibiting glucosamine-6-phosphate acetyltransferase activity, which is known to be a key step toward UDP-GlcNAc synthesis. Despite the fact that nucleotide sugars are synthesized in the cytoplasm, we find EMeg32 associated with Golgi and other intracellular vesicle membranes. We also demonstrate that EMeg32 protein copurifies with the evolutionary conserved cdc48 homolog valosin-containing protein (VCP), a 97-kDa ATPase involved in the reassembly of mitotic Golgi fragments. Whether this is important in light of the accumulation of EMeg32 protein at the G2/M boundary of the cell cycle is discussed. Generation of difference sequences by poly(A) PCR from single hematopoietic cells and subtractive hybridization to enrich for cDNA species present in the “tracer” sample (i.e.bipotent erythroid/megakaryocytic precursor, E/Meg) but not in the “driver” sample (i.e. bipotent neutrophil/macrophage precursor, G/M), is described (10.Brady G. Billia F. Knox J. Hoang T. Kirsch I.R. Voura E.B. Hawley R.G. Cumming R. Buchwald M. Siminovitch K. Miyamoto N. Boehmelt G. Iscove N.N. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 909-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 12.Boehmelt G. Antonio L. Iscove N.N. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 207: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). 5 × 105plaque-forming units from a λZAPII cDNA library generated from S17 stroma cells were screened with the EMeg32 difference tag. DNA was prepared from single positives and digested withNotI to release 2.5-kb inserts, which were subcloned into pBlueScriptIISK+ (Stratagene) thereby generating pSKII-EMeg32. Both strands of the respective inserts were sequenced to completion. The original tag corresponds toEMeg32 cDNA positions nt 2067–2344. Alignment of the two sequences revealed four point mutations in the tag, probably generated by errors in the single-cell PCR reaction. Synthesis of double-stranded cDNA for MarathonTM RACE (CLONTECH) starting from 5 μg of total RNA from spleen or FDC-P1 cells, ligation of cDNA adaptors, and 5′ RACE using “touch-down PCR” were as described (12.Boehmelt G. Antonio L. Iscove N.N. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 207: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with 10 pmol of MarathonTM-adaptor primer AP1 (5′-CCA TCC TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGC-3′) and 20 pmol ofEMeg32-specific 3′primer 133m (5′-CTG TAT TCT GAC TCC AGT CCA CTT CTT TGA, 451m (5′-CTC TGC ACT CGT CAC TAA CGA CGA-3′), or 746m (5′-TAC TAC ACA CTG GCA CAC CAC A-3′) (see Fig. 1). 3′ RACE was done with AP1 primer and 5′ primers 403p (5′-GCT AAG AGA GGG AGA GTA GAA GAT GT-3′) or 2068p (5′-CAA GTA CAA TGG CAC AAG AG-3′) accordingly. Several independent clones from each primer combination were sequenced. Point mutations in the RACE clones as compared with the λZAPII cDNA insert were mutually exclusive. 5′ RACE products did not extend the 5′ end of the original cDNA insert; 4 out of 15 clones analyzed started with its first nucleotide. 3′ RACE products extended the original cDNA insert by 70 bp, revealing a cluster of poly(A) signals at the extreme 3′ end. Poly(A) tails at cDNA positions 1506, 1851, and 1855 were obtained from some 3′ RACE subclones indicative of degenerate poly(A) signals (ATTAAA) at positions 1472 and 1832 (also see Fig. 1). Cell lines were cultured as described previously (11.Kiefer F. Tibbles L.A. Anafi M. Janssen A. Zanke B.W. Lassam N. Pawson T. Woodgett J.R. Iscove N.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7013-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared from murine tissues and cell lines and subjected to Northern blot analysis (12 μg/sample) as described (13.Boehmelt G. Ulrich E. Kurzbauer R. Mellitzer G. Bird A. Zenke M. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 221-230PubMed Google Scholar). The EMeg32-specific tag probe was an EcoRI fragment of the original difference clone and therefore flanked by 26(A) at its 3′ end and 34(T) at the 5′ end. Nested cDNA probes A, B, and C in Fig. 2 were generated from pSKII-EMeg32 by restriction enzyme digest usingNotI-SacI (probe A),SacI-SspI (probe B), or SspI (probe C). In addition, a NcoI-SmaI fragment corresponding to the extreme 3′ end of EMeg32 cDNA downstream of the original tag was used. A NotI site was introduced downstream from the EMeg32 STOP codon and used to fuse a trimerized hemagglutinin (HA) tag followed by 10 histidines in frame to the EMeg32 ORF. The fusion construct was subcloned into pBlueScriptIISK+ generating pSK-EH. For MSCV-EMeg32/HAHIS, anEcoRI fragment of pSK-EH was inserted into the respective site in MSCV-neo (14.Hawley R.G. Lieu F.H. Fong A.Z. Hawley T.S. Gene Ther. 1994; 1: 136-138PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid fusion sequence starting at EMeg32 aa 181 is RFLKSGRIF YPYDVPDYA GYPYDVPDYA GS YPYDVPDYA AQRG(H)10, with the HA tags underlined. MSCV-EMeg32 was generated by inserting anEcoRI-BamHI fragment of pSKII-EMeg32ORF into the respective sites of MSCV-neo. To obtain pSKII-EMeg32ORF, an EcoRI site upstream of the first ATG and a BamHI site downstream of the EMeg32 ORF were introduced by PCR and the respectiveEcoRI-BamHI fragment subcloned into pBlueScript II SK+. pGEX-EMeg32 was generated by subcloning anEcoRI-NotI fragment of pSKII-EMeg32ORF in frame into the respective sites of pGEX-4T2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). pGEX2T-ScGNA1 is described (15.Mio T. Yamada-Okabe T. Arisawa M. Yamada O.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 424-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To generate pFASTBAC-His/EMeg32, an EcoRI-XbaI fragment of pSKII-EMeg32ORF was subcloned in frame into pFASTBAC1-HTb (Life Technologies, Inc.). The amino acid sequence preceding the EMeg32 ORF is MSY Y(H)6D YDI PTT ENL YFQ GAM GSG IPG KMK, with the first EMeg32-specific amino acids underlined and the His tag in bold. To generate pKS-UTR, aSacI-SspI fragment (nt 695–1953 inEMeg32 cDNA) of pSKII-EMeg32 was subcloned into theSacI/SmaI sites of pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene). For the generation of antisense probes, pSKII-EMeg32ORF was linearized withEcoRI and pKS-UTR with SacI followed by in vitro transcription using T3 RNA polymerase in the presence of digitoxigenin-coupled UTP. In situ hybridizations on sections of 129/Sv or CD1 embryos were done as described (16.Ding Q. Motoyama J. Gasca S. Mo R. Sasaki H. Rossant J. Hui C.C. Development. 1998; 125: 2533-2543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three peptides (P1–P3) derived from the EMeg32 ORF were synthesized at Amgen (Boulder, CO) and subjected to a standard rabbit immunization sceme. The peptides are P1 (aa 69–86), EQF MKS FEH MKK SGD YYV; P2 (aa 114–135), AKR GRV EDV VVS DEC RGK QLG K; and P3 (aa 165–179), YKK FDY TVS EEN YMC. For affinity purification, peptides P1 or P2 were coupled to SulfoLink columns (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's specification. Aliquots (3 ml) of the respective sera taken after the second booster injection were purified over these columns, dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and stored in the presence of 0.05% sodium azide at 4 °C. Cells were fixed in 3% PBS-buffered paraformaldehyde (15 min, room temperature), permeabilized using 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS in PBS (15 min, room temperature) and blocked in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) plus 4% fetal calf serum (30 min, room temperature). Following two washes (PBS), samples were incubated (1 h; 37 °C) with affinity-purified α-P1 or α-P2 antibodies diluted (1:20) in blocking solution in the presence of 0.1% SDS. Presence of SDS did not affect the specificity of the monoclonal anti-rat α-mannosidase II antibody (BAbCO). Following washes samples were incubated with secondary antibodies (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig and Texas Red-coupled sheep anti-mouse Ig), washed, and mounted in SlowFade (Molecular Probes) containing DAPI. Samples were analyzed using a LSM400 confocal microscope (Zeiss) and images processed using Adobe Photoshop 4.0. Specificity of affinity-purified α-P1 serum was demonstrated by preincubating the antibody (30 min, 4 °C) with 3-fold excess (w/w) of baculovirus-expressed purified His-EMeg32 in blocking solution plus 0.1% SDS. Fractionation of EpH4 cells and sucrose density gradients were done as described (17.Fialka I. Pasquali C. Lottspeich F. Ahorn H. Huber L.A. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2582-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For salt extraction, postnuclear supernatant was prepared as described for the density gradients. Equal volumes of postnuclear supernatant were gently mixed with homogenization buffer (HB) or 1:1 with 0.6 or 2m NaCl or KCl in HB, to give final concentrations of 0.3 and 1 m, respectively. After 30 min of incubation on ice, membranes were separated from cytosolic and extracted proteins by ultracentrifugation (30 min, 100,000 × g). Membrane pellets were resuspended in the same volume of HB. Soluble and membrane proteins were precipitated with methanol/HCCl3, boiled in Laemmli buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Sample preparation and immunoblotting procedures were as described (18.Boehmelt G. Walker A. Kabrun N. Mellitzer G. Beug H. Zenke M. Enrietto P.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4641-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) with following modifications. For EMeg32-specifc reactions blocking of membranes was with 4% gelatin in PBS (37 °C). Affinity-purified EMeg32-specific antisera were incubated in washing buffer (PBS, 0.04% gelatin, 0.25% Triton X-100) containing 0.1% SDS for 1 h. After five washes membranes were incubated (45 min, 37 °C) with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in washing buffer containing 5% dry milk. Following five washes, membranes were developed using the ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For all other antibody reactions, incubations were at room temperature, blocking was in PBS containing 5% dry milk, and SDS was omitted. Conditions for usage of antibodies against Nuc-1, p58/ERGIC53, calreticulin, Rab5, Rab7, βCOP, and transferrin receptor are described in Ref. 17.Fialka I. Pasquali C. Lottspeich F. Ahorn H. Huber L.A. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2582-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar. Anti-GSK3 (4G-1E) antibody is commercially available (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). 4 × 107 FDC-P1 cells were labeled (4 h; 37 °C) in 4 ml of label medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium minus l-Cys and l-Met, 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum, IL-3, 800 μCi of [35S]Met/Cys (PRO-Mix, 1000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)) and lysed in 2.5 ml of IP buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitors). 10% of cleared lysates were incubated with antisera (2 h, 4 °C) in a 500-μl final volume. Dilutions for preimmune serum or unpurified EMeg32 sera was 1:100, and 1:50 for anti-HA monoclonal 12CA5 (hybridoma supernatant). Antigen/antibody complexes were collected (1 h, 4 °C) with protein A-conjugated Sepharose beads (CL4B, Sigma), which for 12CA5 were conjugated to rabbit anti-mouse Ig (Dako). Following three washes in 1 ml of IP buffer, beads were boiled in 60 μl of sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described (19.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Gels were incubated in Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), dried, and exposed. GST fusion proteins were generated by transformation of pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), pGEX-ScGNA1, or pGEX-EMeg32 into Escherichia coliDH5α. 50-ml cultures were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (3 h; 30 °C), centrifuged, and pellets were washed in ice-cold PBS prior to sonification in 8 ml of AT buffer (see below) containing protease inhibitors. Supernatants of cleared lysates were incubated (2 h; 4 °C) with glutathione-coupled Sepharose beads. Following three washes in 5 ml of AT buffer, bound proteins were eluted twice using 600 μl of E buffer (20 mm glutathione, 100 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl) and dialyzed overnight against 1 liter of AT buffer. High Five insect cells were infected with pFASTBAC-His/EMeg32 recombinant baculovirus (multiplicity of infection = 10). Adherent cells were shaken off the plates in PBS plus protease inhibitors, pelleted by centrifugation, snap-frozen, and stored at -80 °C until use. Cells were thawed in 10 volumes (w/v) of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.32 m sucrose, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, protease inhibitors) and homogenized. Low speed (500 × g) centrifugation supernatants were cleared (50,000 × g, 30 min) and passed over nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen). Beads were washed with 20 column bed volumes (CBV) of lysis buffer followed by 20 CBV of wash buffer (500 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, 40 mm imidazole, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, protease inhibitors). Bound protein was eluted off the column with 8 CBV of BE buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 40 mm imidazole, 50 mm EDTA, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, protease inhibitors), dialyzed (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol), concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon, YM3 ultrafiltration membrane), snap-frozen, and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. For analysis of the 200-kDa band co-purifying with His-EMeg32 (but not with His-AIF (His-tagged apoptosis inhibitory factor)) from baculo-extracts, its stable, monomeric 100-kDa form was reduced with dithiothreitol, carboxyamidomethylated with iodoacetamide, and separated on SDS-PAGE. The 100-kDa band was cut out, in-gel digested with Lys-C endoprotease, and run on a capillary liquid chromatography connected in line to an ion trap-tandem mass spectrometer (MS/MS). Acquired MS/MS spectra were searched against the OWL data base using SEQUEST (LCQ BioWorks, Finnigan, San Jose, CA; Ref. 20.Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Yates J.R.I. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5472) Google Scholar). Peptides that matched to peptides from mouse p97/VCP (accession number Q01853) were LAGESESNLRK (aa 278–288, mass 1203.55 Da), AGESESNLRK (aa 279–288, mass 1090.56 Da), 3 times RELQELVQYPVEHPDK (aa 487–502, masses: 1979.94 Da, 1980.01 Da, 1980.07 Da), and GFSGADLTEICQRACK (aa 681–696, mass 1812.70 Da). Acetyl-CoA, GlcN6P, GalN1P, GlcN1P, and 5,5′-dithiobis[2-nitrobenzoic acid] (DTNB) were from Sigma. If not indicated otherwise, 0.1 μg of purified protein was incubated in 50 μl of AT buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2) containing 200 μm substrate and 200 μm acetyl-CoA for 10 min at 30 °C in 96-well flat bottom plates. Reactions were stopped by addition of 50 μl of 6.4 m guanidinium hydrochloride in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0. Samples were developed by addition of 50 μl of DV buffer (20 μm DTNB, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). Absorbance (E) of samples was determined at 412 nm. Concentration (c) of CoA produced was calculated based onE = εlc with εDTNB = 13,700m−1 cm−1 and l = 0.5 cm. Following one wash, 108FDC-P1 cells were resuspended in 10 ml of EL buffer (PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+; 1 mm dithiothreitol) and loaded on a Beckman JE-5.0 elutriator with a flow rate of 10 ml/min at 2000 rpm (4 °C). Flow rate was increased by 2 ml/min for every second 50-ml fraction collected. The fractions used for analysis covered a range from 16 ml/min to 28 ml/min. For the last 2 fractions, 200-ml aliquots were collected. Cells were pelleted and either resuspended in EL buffer plus 1% Triton X-100 for protein analysis, or in 50% ethanol for standard propidium iodide staining and cell cycle analysis on a FACScalibur (Becton Dickinson) using CellQuest software. MSCV-neo, MSCV-EMeg32, and MSCV-EMeg32/HAHIS constructs were transfected into GP+E86 packaging cells (21.Markowitz D. Goff S. Bank A. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and subjected to G418 (0.7 mg/ml) selection. Titers were determined by dilution series on NIH3T3 cells and were 5 × 105/ml (MSCV-neo) and 2 × 105/ml (MSCV-EMeg32(HAHIS)). For generation of FDC-P1 cells expressing MSCV-neo, MSCV-EMeg32, or MSCV-EMeg32/HAHIS, virus supernatants from respective GP+E86 cells were used for a 2-day infection period followed by the isolation of G418-resistant clones subsequent to a 7-day selection period in semisolid Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium-based methylcellulose cultures in the presence of 8% fetal calf serum, 0.3 mg/ml G418, and 1% conditioned medium from X63 cells as a source for IL-3 (22.Trevisan M. Iscove N.N. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We generated a set of cDNAs from single murine hematopoietic cells with defined developmental potential (10.Brady G. Billia F. Knox J. Hoang T. Kirsch I.R. Voura E.B. Hawley R.G. Cumming R. Buchwald M. Siminovitch K. Miyamoto N. Boehmelt G. Iscove N.N. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 909-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and applied this system to identify genes specific for bipotent precursors of the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages (E/Meg) using subtractive hybridization. A cDNA sample from a bipotent neutrophil/macrophage (N/M) precursor (driver) was subtracted from a bipotent E/Meg precursor (tracer), tracer-enriched cDNA material was subcloned, and 56 random difference clones were screened on our hematopoietic hierarchy cDNA blots. Of these, clone 32 was of particular interest, because it exhibited a striking differential expression pattern (also see Fig. 7 in Ref. 10.Brady G. Billia F. Knox J. Hoang T. Kirsch I.R. Voura E.B. Hawley R.G. Cumming R. Buchwald M. Siminovitch K. Miyamoto N. Boehmelt G. Iscove N.N. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 909-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This 3′ sequence tag hybridized to most tripotent erythroid/megakaryocytic/mast cell (E/Meg/Mast) precursors, strongly to the bipotent E/Meg precursors, and to none of the bipotent N/M precursors analyzed. (Fig.1 A). In descendents of bipotent E/Meg precursors, tag expression is only found in the megakaryocytic, but not in the erythroid branch (Fig. 1 A). Expression was also detectable in monopotent macrophage and neutrophil precursors. Besides being expressed in mature megakaryocytes, tag expression is present in mature macrophages, while cDNA from other mature populations did not hybridize (Fig. 1 A). Sequencing followed by initial data base searches revealed that this difference tag, EMeg32, was novel. Subsequently, a cDNA library generated from S17 stroma cells was screened with the EMeg32 subtraction tag. We identified three clones containing a 2.5-kb cDNA insert which contains an open reading frame (ORF) of 184 amino acids (aa) at its 5′ end (nt 64–615, Fig. 1 B). RACE was performed using RNA from FDC-P1 cells and spleen and various combinations of gene-specific primers. As a result, (i) the original cDNA sequence could be confirmed and extended on the 3′ end by several nucleotides (Fig. 1 B, see “Experimental Procedures”). RT-PCR using primers corresponding to the extreme ends of EMeg32 cDNA confirmed that the additional sequences are valid. (ii) There was no STOP codon in frame upstream of the first ATG chosen. However, the region around this ATG matches the Kozak consensus sequence well. (iii) No alternative splice products could be detected (Fig. 1 B and data not shown). (iv) There are 5 classical poly(A) signals (5′-AATAAA-3′) in the 3′-untranslated region of EMeg32 cDNA (nt 771, 1873, 2481, 2487, and 2491), which may not all be relevant for the addition of poly(A) tails, because several RACE products captured poly(A) tails indicating the use of degenerate poly(A) signals (5′-ATTAAA-3′) at positions 1832 and 1472 (Fig. 1 B). Northern analysis on RNA from several murine tissues and cell lines with probes covering different areas of the cDNA revealed that three mRNA species of 0.9, 1.6, and 2.6 kb in size contain EMeg32 ORF-specific sequences (Fig. 1 C). However, the original tag (nt 2067–2344) or a probe derived from sequences downstream (nt 2420–2536) of the 3′ tag hybridized to two RNA species of 2.6 and 4.4 kb in size (data not shown). Importantly, the 4.4-kb mRNA species does not hybridize to cDNA probes specific for theEMeg32 ORF or 3′-untranslated region up to nucleotide position 1953 (Fig. 1 C). While the length of the clonedEMeg32 cDNA (2536 bp) is in good accord with the 2.6-kb mRNA species, the nature of the 4.4-kb mRNA species still remains elusive. Noteworthy, a number of 5′ ends of murine expressed sequence tags overlap with the extreme 3′ end of EMeg32 cDNA and we are therefore currently pursuing the possibility that the 4.4-kb transcript represents a mRNA species transcribed in the opposite direction relative to EMeg32. Together with the RACE and RT-PCR experiments performed, the Northern analysis confirms the integrity of the EMeg32 cDNA and argues for alternative polyadenylation rather than alternative splicing as the likely mechanism generating the three major mRNA species (Fig. 1, B and C, and data not shown). Despite the differential expression of EMeg32 mRNA in the hematopoietic hierarchy, it is expressed in all tissues analyzed by Northern blotting. The 1.6-kb species is generally more abundant than the other two transcripts. Its expression in adult mice is highest in liver, kidney, and salivary glands; intermediate in intestine, thymus, and lung; but low in heart, spleen, brain, bone marrow, and testis (Fig. 1 C and d"

[2-(Trimethylammonium)-ethyl]-methanethiosulfonate (MTSET), which attaches thiocholine to binding site Cys, also acted as an irreversible antagonist when tethered at αY93C, αN94C, or γE57C. However, MTSET modification of αY198C resulted in prolonged activation of the nAChR not reversible by washing but inhibitable by subsequent exposure to non-competitive antagonists. Modification of αY198C (or any of the other positions tested) by [(trimethylammonium)methyl]methanethiosulfonate resulted only in irreversible inhibition, while modification of αY198C by [3-(trimethylammonium)propyl]methanethiosulfonate resulted in irreversible activation of nAChR, but at lower efficacy than by MTSET. Thus changing the length of the tethering arm by less than 1 Å in either direction markedly effects the ability of the covalent trimethylammonium to activate the nAChR, and agonist activation depends on a very selective orientation of the quaternary ammonium within the agonist binding site.

Efficient channel gating depends upon the binding of two acetylcholine (ACh) molecules. The binding sites for agonist and competitive antagonists are within the extracellular domain of the nAChR at the α-γ and α-δ subunit interfaces (1.Blount P. Merlie J.P.

In embryonic mouse muscle nAChR (α2βγδ), the site selectivity of dimethyl-d-tubocurarine has been attributed to amino acid differences in loop E (γIle116Tyr117/δVal118Thr119) and loop F (γSer161/δLys163) (13.Sine S.M.

Despite the availability of this large body of information about the identity of amino acids that contribute to the agonist binding site, little is known about their overall three-dimensional distribution or about the orientation of agonists or antagonists bound within the site. ACh has two functional groups, the acetyl group and a quaternary ammonium group located within 6.4 Å of the carbonyl carbon. Simpler quaternary ammonium compounds including choline and tetramethylammonium also act as agonists, although they are less potent than ACh, and when bound the probability of channel opening is substantially lower than for ACh (16.Akk G. Auerbach A. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2652-2658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 17.Zhou M. Engel A.G. Auerbach A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

While 4-(N-maleimido)benzyltrimethylammonium (MBTA) acts as an irreversible antagonist after reaction with αCys192/193in reduced, wild type nAChR (18.Kao P. Dwork A.J. Kaldany R.J. Silver M.L. Wideman J. Stein S. Karlin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11662-11665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), bromoacetylcholine (BrACh) acts as a covalent agonist after reaction with αCys192/193 (19.Damle V.N. McLaughlin M. Karlin A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 84: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar,20.Chabala L.D. Lester H.A. J. Physiol. 1986; 379: 83-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, in the reduced nAChR, interactions of the trimethylammonio group within 9 Å of αCys192/193 are sufficient for channel gating. Affinity labeling with [3H]ACh mustard, containing the positive charge within a reactive aziridinium, indicates that the positive charge of ACh interacts with αTyr93 in the desensitized state of the nAChR (21.Cohen J.B. Sharp S.D. Liu W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23354-23364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Replacement of αTrp149 by an unnatural amino acid, Tyr-O-(CH2)3N(CH3)3, results in a constitutively active receptor (22.Zhong W.G. Gallivan J.P. Zhang Y.N. Li L.T. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12088-12093Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), suggesting that an interaction between the quaternary ammonium ion and the α149 side chain may be important for nAChR activation. To further characterize the agonist binding site structure, we have introduced Cys substitutions in α-subunit in ACh site loops A, B, and C and in γ-subunit loop D and examined the functional properties of these mutant nAChRs after reaction with sulfhydryl reagents. Cys mutagenesis has been widely used to determine secondary structure in a number of ion channels and membrane topology, residue accessibility, and transmembrane proximity of several bacterial membrane proteins (23.Frillingos S.

We describe here studies of Torpedo nAChR wild type and Cys mutant subunits expressed in Xenopus oocytes and assayed by monitoring ACh-elicited currents in the two-electrode voltage clamp configuration and by measuring surface receptor levels by125I-α-bungarotoxin (α-BgTx) binding. The effects of covalent modification within the binding site were investigated using sulfhydryl-specific reagents, including MBTA, BrACh, and methanethiosulfonate (MTS) derivatives, which can add to Cys-SH a variety of differently charged and sized groups (31.Stauffer D.A. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6840-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). 2-Aminoethylmethanethiosulfonate (MTSEA) adds a positively charged primary amine to Cys. [2-(Trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate (MTSET) covalently attaches thiocholine to Cys. [1-(Trimethylammonium)methyl]methanethiosulfonate (MTSMT), which is one methylene shorter than MTSET, adds a thio(trimethylamino)methyl group to Cys, and [1-(trimethylammonium)propyl]methanethiosulfonate (MTSPT), which is one methylene longer than MTSET, ads homo-thiocholine. The results presented here begin to define the orientation of the quaternary ammonium ion within the agonist binding site that is required for nAChR activation. pSP64-based plasmids (pMXT) containing cDNAs encoding the wild type α-, γ-, and δ-subunits were gifts from Dr. Michael White (Departments of Pharmacology and Physiology, MCP Hahnemann University, Philadelphia, PA), and the β-subunit cDNA in pSP64 was from Dr. Henry Lester (California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA). Mutants were constructed using “overlap extension” PCR, which consists of two successive PCRs (32.Horton R.M. Pease L.R. McPherson M.J. Directed Mutagenesis: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 217-247Google Scholar). Primers used for PCR and DNA sequencing were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. DNA modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) and Life Technologies, Inc. Qiagen (Valencia, CA) Minipreps were used to propagate plasmid DNAs. All PCRs were performed using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Mutagenic primers were generally 30–40 base pairs long, and the mismatch region was surrounded by at least 12 base pairs on each side. The overlap region for the first and second PCR products was 12–20 base pairs. Mutations around αTyr93 were made by generating an ∼300-base pair PCR product that was subcloned using unique restriction sites within the α-subunit coding region:Bsu36I and BsiWI. Mutations at αTrp149 were generated using conventional one-step PCR mutagenesis by incorporating the desired change into the antisense primer, which overlapped at the BsiWI site, and using the sense primer, which overlapped the Bsu36I site. Mutations in the α-subunit at αTyr190 and αTyr198 were generated using primers that gave ∼1000-base pair PCR product, which could be subcloned using the Bsu36I restriction site and theBbvII site near the 3′ end of the coding region. Mutations around γTrp55 were made by generating an ∼1.13-kilobase PCR product that was subcloned using the unique HindIII site in the vector and the StuI site in the γ-subunit coding region. Each PCR mix contained 0.5 μm primers, 50 ng of template DNA, and 0.4 mm dNTPs in the reaction buffer supplied with the enzyme. For αTyr93 mutations, the first PCR reactions were for 30 cycles with a three-step protocol (2 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 50 °C, 1 min at 72 °C); the second PCR reactions were for 24 cycles (1.5 min at 95 °C, at 45 °C, and at 72 °C). The latter 24-cycle protocol was also used for both PCR reactions for mutations at αTyr190 and αTyr198 and also for mutations around γTrp55. The desired PCR products were purified from excised agarose gel slices using cellulose acetate centrifugal filters (Costar, Corning, NY) or by traditional phenol extraction/ethanol precipitation. The final PCR product containing the desired mutation was inserted into the subunit gene using DNA ligase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Incorporation of the engineered mutation and the fidelity of the PCR were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Biopolymers Facilities, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) through the amplified region. cDNAs were linearized with either XbaI (for α-, γ-, and δ-subunits) or FspI (for β-subunit) and transcribed in vitro with SP6 polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). RNAs were quantitated using [3H]UTP (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) and were diluted at a ratio of 2α:1β:1γ:1δ to a final concentration of 0.2 μg/μl for oocyte injection. Isolated, follicle-free oocytes were obtained by collagenase (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Freehold, NJ) treatment and were maintained in ND96 buffer (in mm: 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, pH 7.6, 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Life Technologies, Inc.)). Currents elicited by ACh were measured from oocytes 48–72 h after injection using a standard two-electrode voltage clamp (Oocyte clamp OC-725B, Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT) at a holding potential of −70 mV. Electrodes were filled with 3m KCl and had resistances of 0.5–1.5 megohms. The recording chamber was perfused by gravity with low calcium ND96 (in mm: 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 0.3 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, pH 7.6) containing 1 μmatropine. Various concentrations of ACh, and other reagents, were applied into the recording chamber for 5 s through solenoid valves. Salts, atropine, ACh, dTC, and tetracaine were from Sigma. QX-222 was from Astra Pharmaceuticals (Worcester, MA). Stock solutions of competitive and noncompetitive antagonists were dissolved in recording solution prior to use. Stock solutions of MTS reagents (Toronto Research Chemicals Inc., North York, Ontario, Canada) were prepared at millimolar concentrations in recording solution and stored on ice during use, with fresh solutions prepared approximately every 2 h, except for MTSMT, which was stable for only ∼15 min on ice. For nAChR activation, ACh dose-response curves were fit to the equation: I/I max = (1 + (K app/[ACh]) n)−1, where I and I max are the currents at a given concentration of ACh and the maximal current, respectively.K app is the apparent activation constant for ACh, and n is the Hill coefficient. pCLAMP (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and SigmaPlot (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) software were used for data analysis. For the Cys reagents producing irreversible inhibition of ACh responses, the time course of the reaction with a substituted Cys mutant in the absence of ACh was determined by recording the initial response to ACh and then the response to ACh after repeated applications of modifying reagent for 5-s intervals. Each application of reagent was followed by a ∼1-min wash, three ACh test applications (5 s each), and a 1-min wash. ACh was generally applied at a concentration equal toK app. ACh-induced currents after treatment were plotted as a function of cumulative modification time (t) and fit by a single exponential function, I t =I oexp(−kxt) where x is the concentration of the reagent and k the second order rate constant (33.Pascual J.M. Karlin A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 717-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). At least two concentrations of reagent were tested on two separate days. For reagents resulting in irreversible activation of nAChRs, responses were measured after each 5-s application, and ACh test pulses were omitted. Observed currents were fit to the function:I t = I o +I ∞(1 − exp(−kxt)). To measure binding to nAChRs expressed on the surface, oocytes were incubated with 2.5 nm125I-α-BgTx (2000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at room temperature in a final volume of 200 μl of ND96 + 0.1% bovine serum albumin and then washed three times with 500 μl of ND96. Oocytes were transferred to individual tubes and counted for 5 min/tube in a γ counter. Initially, Cys substitutions were introduced individually at positions previously identified, by photolabeling or mutagenesis studies, as contributing to the agonist binding site: αTyr93, αTrp149, αTyr190, αTyr198, γTrp55, and γGlu57. To determine whether the introduction of Cys at any of these positions disrupted nAChR expression, we assessed functional properties by measuring ACh-elicited currents and the binding of 125I-α-BgTx to nAChRs on the oocyte surface. Most of the Cys substitutions were well tolerated, when expressed with other wild type subunits (Fig. 1). Under our experimental conditions, for wild type nAChR, theK app for ACh was 25 μm with a Hill coefficient of 1.6 and injection of 10 ng of subunit RNA resulted in the expression on the oocyte surface of ∼4 fmol of125I-α-BgTx binding 48 h after injection. The Cys substitutions in γ-subunit at γTrp55(K app = 31 μm,n H = 1.6) and γGlu57(K app = 54 μm,n H = 1.7) caused little if any shift ofK app or Hill coefficient, as compared with wild type, and the maximal currents and surface 125I-α-BgTx binding were also similar to wild type. Cys substitutions at αTyr93 (K app = 520 μm, n H = 1.9) and αTyr198 (K app = 790 μm, n H = 1.4) caused substantial shifts of K app, consistent with previous mutational studies, where more conservative substitutions at these positions also resulted in significant decreases in ACh potency (34.Sine S.M. Quiram P. Papanikolaou F. Kreienkamp H.J. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8808-8816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,35.Aylwin M.L. White M.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For these mutant receptors, surface 125I-α-BgTx binding was ∼50% of wild type, but the maximal currents were only ∼1% of wild type. Oocytes expressing αY190C nAChRs showed no ACh-elicited current and had low surface receptor levels (<10% of wild type), as reported for the same mutation in the mouse muscle nAChR (28.McLaughlin J.T. Hawrot E. Yellen G. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Oocytes expressing αW149C nAChRs also showed no ACh-elicited currents, although their surface receptor levels were similar to those of αY93C and αY198C nAChRs. The I max and surface receptor measurements showed that Cys substitutions at αTyr93, αTyr198, γTrp55, and γGlu57 resulted in functional receptors expressed at levels sufficient for further analysis. Oocytes expressing wild type nAChR or mutant nAChRs containing agonist site cysteines were reacted with MBTA or MTSEA in the absence of agonist and then retested for sensitivity to ACh. MBTA, a sulfhydryl-reactive benzyltrimethylammonium, is known to act as an irreversible antagonist of wild type nAChR after reduction of the αCys192/193disulfide (18.Kao P. Dwork A.J. Kaldany R.J. Silver M.L. Wideman J. Stein S. Karlin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11662-11665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and we reasoned that if it reacted with cysteines introduced at other positions in the active site it might also act as an irreversible antagonist. Reaction with MTSEA would introduce a positively charged primary amine within the binding site. The general protocol was to first measure the response to ACh at a concentration close to its K app, then expose the oocyte to MBTA (1 mm) or MTSEA (2 mm) for 5 s, and then to remeasure the ACh response after a 1–2-min wash to remove reversibly bound reagent (Fig. 2). Representative current traces are shown for wild type nAChRs and for αY93C and αY198C mutant nAChRs treated with MBTA (Fig.2 A) and MTSEA (Fig. 2 B), as well as summary data for those mutants as well as the γW55C and γE57C mutants (Fig.2 C). For oocytes expressing wild type nAChR, after treatment with MBTA and washing, there was a small (∼20%) decrease in the response to ACh, substantially less than the 75% and 95% inhibition seen for αY93C and αY198C nAChRs, respectively. For wild type nAChR, exposure to MTSEA resulted in no irreversible inhibition, while there was >95% inhibition of ACh responses for αY93C and αY198C mutant nAChRs. For Cys substitution within loop D of γ-subunit, treatment of γE57C nAChRs with either MBTA or MTSEA resulted in irreversible current inhibition, while treatment of γW55C nAChRs resulted in no inhibition greater than that seen for wild type nAChRs. Even after treatment of γW55C nAChRs with 5 mm MTSEA for 4 min, after washing the ACh response was inhibited by <10% (data not shown). These results established that γE57C, αY93C, and αY198C were accessible for chemical modification and that reaction at those positions with either MBTA or MTSEA resulted in the addition of covalent antagonists. The lack of effect at γW55C indicates that Cys at that position is not accessible for chemical modification. The ACh responses of γE57C, αY93C, and αY198C nAChRs were significantly affected by MTSEA treatment. To further characterize this inhibition, we determined the full ACh dose-response curves before and after a 5-s treatment of MTSEA (Fig.3 A). Consistent with irreversible inactivation of nAChRs, MTSEA treatment caused a decrease in the peak current response for each of the mutant nAChRs with little if any shift in the K app. The effects of the addition of thiocholine to agonist site cysteines were studied by reacting mutant nAChRs with MTSET (Fig.4). MTSET at 100 μm neither acted as an agonist for wild type nAChR nor produced irreversible inhibition of ACh responses. The same MTSET treatment resulted in a complete, irreversible inhibition of αY93C nAChRs and a partial inhibition of γE57C nAChR responses. The modifications resulted in decreased maximal currents for ACh without alteration ofK app (Fig. 3 B). As for MBTA and MTSEA, for γW55C nAChRs, exposure to 5 mm MTSET for as long as 4 min led to <10% reduction of the ACh response, an extent of inhibition similar to that seen for wild type nAChR (data not shown). MTSET treatment of αY198C nAChRs produced a very different result. Treatment of oocytes expressing αY198C nAChRs with 10 μm MTSET resulted in the onset of a large, inward current, which was sustained upon MTSET washout (Fig. 4 A). In comparison with the response to ACh (at K app) seen before treatment with MTSET, the peak current observed after treatment with MTSET was actually 7 times as large. MTSET treatment of oocytes injected with αY190C or αW149C nAChRs did not produce any measurable currents (data not shown). While thiocholine tethered at positions αY93C or γE57C acted as a covalent antagonist, it appeared to act as a covalent agonist when tethered at position αY198C. To test whether MTSET was acting through the agonist binding site, we examined whether binding of the competitive antagonist, dTC, would prevent reaction of MTSET with the αY198C nAChR (Fig. 5). As expected, when dTC at 10 μm was coapplied with ACh, there was a reversible inhibition of ACh response. When coapplied with 1 μmMTSET, 10 μm dTC prevented the reaction of MTSET with αY198C, as evidenced by the lack of conductance response. Upon washing, there was no detectable inward current, but subsequent re-exposure to 1 μm MTSET produced an inward current that gradually declined during minutes of washing. When ACh was applied after several minutes of washing, it reversibly inhibited the sustained current, presumably because at a holding potential of −70 mV, 1 mm ACh acts as an open channel blocker (36.Ogden D.C.

The inward current seen after treatment with MTSET decreased slowly, typically by 50% in 1 min, and treatment of the oocyte with 1 mmdithiothreitol produced a more rapid return to base line, after which ACh once again elicited inward currents (data not shown). Further studies would be required to determine whether the gradual decrease of the inward current reflected slow desensitization of the mutant nAChR and/or whether persistent channel gating at −70 mV resulted in a gradual increase of sodium concentration within the oocyte. The sustained, inward current seen after reaction of αY198C nAChRs with MTSET was inhibitable by nAChR aromatic amine noncompetitive antagonists (Fig. 6). The classic nAChR open channel blocker QX-222 (37.Charnet P. Labarca C. Leonard R.J. Vogelaar N.J. Czyzyk L. Gavin A. Davidsen N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1990; 2: 87-95Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (218) Google Scholar) produced a readily reversible reduction of the sustained inward current (Fig. 6 A), as did tetracaine (Fig. 6 B), which is known to bind to a single, high affinity site within the lumen of the nAChR ion channel (38.Gallagher M.J. Cohen J.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 300-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Proadifen, which preferentially binds to the desensitized state of the nAChR (39.Boyd N.D. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4023-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), was a potent inhibitor of the sustained current (Fig.6 C), but in contrast to what was seen for QX-222 and tetracaine, inhibition by proadifen was not readily reversible with washing. Two additional quaternary ammonium MTS reagents were used to further characterize the structural requirements necessary for nAChR activation (Fig.7). MTSMT, which is one methylene shorter than MTSET, adds a thio(trimethylamino)methyl group to Cys. MTSPT, which is one methylene longer than MTSET, adds homo-thiocholine. The consequence of MTSMT modification was qualitatively similar to that of MBTA and MTSEA. Exposure to 200 μm MTSMT for 5 s resulted in irreversible inhibition of αY93C, αY198C, and γE57C mutant nAChRs, and there was no evidence that it reacted with γW55C. The result of MTSPT modification was qualitatively similar to that for MTSET. A 5-s treatment with 200 μm MTSPT resulted in irreversible inhibition of αY93C and γE57C mutant nAChRs, while for αY198C, modification resulted in a prolonged, inward current ∼1.4-fold greater in magnitude than the current elicited by 1 mm ACh. To determine the maximal currents resulting from modification of αY198C nAChRs by MTSET compared with MTSPT, oocytes expressing mutant nAChR were exposed sequentially to increasing concentrations of either reagent. For both MTSET and MTSPT, exposure to 0.1 μmproduced sustained inward currents, and for each reagent maximal currents were seen after exposure to concentrations of 1–3 μm (Fig. 8, Aand B). For αY198C nAChRs, the maximal current produced by MTSET was consistently ∼5 times the response of MTSPT and ∼10 times the response produced by 1 mm ACh. This difference might result either because MTSET reacted with more nAChRs or because after covalent modification it activated the αY198C mutant nAChR in a more efficient manner than ACh or MTSPT. Fig. 8 C shows that after an oocyte had been fully modified by MTSPT, treatment with MTSET caused no further increase in current, suggesting that the two reagents do react wi"

We examined human embryonic lung fibroblasts that constitutively express the B1 receptor and report that engagement of the B1 receptor by des-Arg10-kallidin stabilized connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) mRNA, stimulated an increase in α1(I) collagen mRNA, and stimulated type I collagen production. These events were not observed in B2 receptor-activated fibroblasts. In addition, B1 receptor activation by des-Arg10-kallidin induced a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ that is consistent with B1 receptor pharmacology. Our results show that the des-Arg10-kallidin-stimulated increase in α1(I) collagen mRNA was time- and dose-dependent, with a peak response observed at 20 h with 100 nmdes-Arg10-kallidin. The increase in CTGF mRNA was also time- and dose-dependent, with a peak response observed at 4 h with 100 nm des-Arg10-kallidin. The increase in CTGF mRNA was blocked by the B1 receptor antagonist des-Arg10,Leu9-kallidin. Inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide did not block the des-Arg10-kallidin-induced increase in CTGF mRNA. These results suggest that engagement of the kinin B1 receptor contributes to fibrogenesis through increased expression of CTGF.

Activation of the B1 receptor induces cellular and physiological responses that often mimic the responses observed following activation of the B2 receptor. For instance, both receptors activate nuclear factor κB in fibroblasts (6.Pan Z.K. Zuraw B.L. Lung C.C. Prossnitz E.R. Browning D.D. Ye R.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2042-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), modulate vascular tone (7.Cuthbert A.W. Teather S. Immunopharmacology. 1997; 36: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), and activate phospholipase C in mesangial cells (8.Roberts R.A. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1989; 1: 237-252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, receptor-specific physiological responses induced by the kinin receptors are demonstrated in the kinin-mediated bronchoconstriction of asthmatic airways. The B2 receptor agonists bradykinin (BK)1 and kallidin (Lys-BK) are potent bronchoconstrictors (9.Herxheimer H. Stresemann E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1961; 158: 38-39Google Scholar), whereas the B1 receptor agonist des-Arg10-kallidin does not induce bronchoconstriction (10.Reynolds C.J. Togias A. Proud D. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1999; 159: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The B2 receptor, the classical bradykinin receptor, is widely expressed and binds both BK and kallidin with high affinity. In wound repair, activation of the B2 receptor induces a variety of effects, including increased neutrophil proliferation, stimulation of macrophage spreading, release of histamine from mast cells, synthesis of platelet-activating factor and prostaglandins in endothelial cells, release of tachykinin and acetylcholine from sensory nerve endings, increased microvascular permeability, and fibroblast proliferation (2.Proud D. Kaplan A.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 49-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Early studies described the B1 receptor as an inducible receptor whose expression is up-regulated following exposure to interleukin-1β or other pro-inflammatory agents (11.Davis A.J. Perkins M.N. Neuropharmacology. 1994; 33: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A recent study has identified expression of the B1 receptor by immunohistochemistry in transbronchial biopsies from patients with sarcoidosis or progressive systemic sclerosis, whereas expression of the B1 receptor was undetectable in normal subjects (12.Nadar R. Derrick A. Naidoo S. Naidoo Y. Hess F. Bhoola K. Immunopharmacology. 1996; 33: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Activation of the B1 receptor induces relaxation or contraction of various smooth muscle cell preparations, mediates chronic pain, and may be involved in chronic inflammation (1.Marceau F. Hess J.F. Bachvarov D.R. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 357-386PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated the expression of the B1 receptor in apparently healthy renal (13.Lortie M. Regoli D.

Res. 1994; 75: 1064-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) tissues; however, the role of the B1 receptor in homeostasis and wound repair is not understood. Activation of the B1 receptor stimulates prostaglandin synthesis in fibroblasts, release of tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin-1β from macrophages, and prostaglandin and platelet-activating factor synthesis in endothelial cells (1.Marceau F. Hess J.F. Bachvarov D.R. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 357-386PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was proposed that TGF-β stimulates fibrogenesis and proliferation in fibroblasts via a mechanism that requires de novo synthesis of a secondary factor, which has been identified as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) (18.Frazier K. Williams S. Kothapalli D. Klapper H. Grotendorst G.R. J. Invest Dermatol. 1996; 107: 404-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). CTGF, a member of the CCN family, is a cysteine-rich, heparin-binding, 349-amino acid protein (19.Bradham D.M. Igarashi A. Potter R.L. Grotendorst G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Other members of the CCN family include Fisp12/BIGM2 (mouse ortholog of CTGF) (20.Ryseck R.P. Macdonald-Bravo H. Mattei M.G. Bravo R. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 225-233PubMed Google Scholar), Cyr61 (and the chick ortholog Cef10) (21.Lau L.F. Nathans D.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14717-14722Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). CCN proteins possess a secretory signal peptide and four distinct protein modules: an insulin-like growth factor-binding domain, a von Willebrand factor type C repeat, a thrombospondin type 1 repeat, and a C-terminal module. CTGF-L does not contain the C-terminal domain. The CCN family is further distinguished by the high degree of amino acid homology (50–90%) and conservation of 38 cysteine residues. TGF-β (but not epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, or platelet-derived growth factor) stimulates CTGF transcription in normal rat kidney fibroblasts (26.Grotendorst G.R. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). In adult mammals, CTGF is expressed in high levels during wound repair and at sites of connective tissue formation in a variety of fibrotic disorders (27.Ito Y. Aten J. Bende R.J. Oemar B.S. Rabelink T.J. Weening J.J. Goldschmeding R. Kidney Int. 1998; 53: 853-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar,28.Igarashi A. Nashiro K. Kikuchi K. Sato S. Ihn H. Grotendorst G.R. Takehara K. J. Invest Dermatol. 1995; 105: 280-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). CTGF is expressed in lung fibroblasts and has been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis (29.Lasky J.A. Ortiz L.A. Tonthat B. Hoyle G.W. Corti M. Athas G. Lungarella G. Brody A. Friedman M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L365-L371PubMed Google Scholar). Our goal was to examine B1 receptor-induced fibrogenesis. Using a human embryonic lung fibroblast cell line, we report that des-Arg10-kallidin, upon binding to the B1 receptor, activates an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ with a different fluorescence signature using fura-2 than the B2 receptor and specifically induces dose- and time-dependent increases in α1(I) collagen mRNA and CTGF mRNA. The increase in steady-state CTGF mRNA levels involves stabilization of the message through a mechanism that is cycloheximide-insensitive and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-sensitive. The data suggest that the B1 receptor has a distinct function in the pathophysiology of fibrotic lung diseases. Human embryonic lung fibroblasts (IMR-90, Institute for Medical Research, Camden, NJ) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 0.37 g/100 ml sodium bicarbonate, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids. Cell numbers were determined by triplicate cell counts with an electronic particle counter (Coulter Counter ZM). Confluent IMR-90 fibroblast cultures were incubated in DMEM supplemented with 0.4% FBS for 24 h. The culture medium was supplemented with protease inhibitors (captopril (10 μm), phosphoramidon (1 μm), anddl-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethylthiopropanoic acid (1 μm)) and stimulated as indicated. Total cellular RNA was isolated by the single-step method employing guanidine thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (30.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62899) Google Scholar). RNA was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm. Purity was determined by absorbance at 280 and 310 nm. RNA (10 μg) was electrophoresed through a 6% formaldehyde-containing 1% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane. RNA loading was assessed by ethidium bromide staining of ribosomal bands and by co-hybridization with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The α1(I) collagen probe is a 1.5-kilobase pair fragment of rat α1(I) collagen cDNA that specifically binds human α1(I) collagen mRNA. The CTGF probe is a 586-base pair polymerase chain reaction product generated with the forward primer gtggagtatgtaccgacggcc and the reverse primer acaggcaggtcagtgagcacgc. The filter was exposed to x-ray film for autoradiography at several different times to ensure that the bands could be quantified by densitometry within the linear range. Quantification of TGF-β released by IMR-90 fibroblast cultures was determined using a TGF-β bioassay based on the inhibition of growth of mink lung epithelial cells (MLECs) by TGF-β (31.Danielpour D. Dart L.L. Flanders K.C. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 138: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). MLECs were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and passaged every 3 days. MLECs were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates. After 24 h, the cultures were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and refed with DMEM (0.5 ml/well) without FBS and supplemented with leupeptin (2 μg/ml), aprotinin (2 μg/ml), and pepstatin A (2 μg/ml). Conditioned medium from control or des-Arg10-kallidin-stimulated IMR-90 fibroblasts was centrifuged (500 × g, 10 min) to remove non-adherent cells and then added to the MLECs (0.5 ml/well). The cultures were incubated for 20 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and then pulsed with [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/well; NEN Life Science Products) for 2 h. The plates were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 1 ml of acetic acid/methanol (1:3, v/v) 1 h at room temperature, washed twice with 80% methanol, digested for 30 min with 0.5 ml of 0.05% trypsin dissolved with 0.5 ml of 0.1% SDS, and scintillation-counted. The quantification of the TGF-β content of conditioned medium was interpolated from a standard curve generated by replacing conditioned medium with DMEM supplemented with TGF-β (0.003–1.0 ng/ml). Inhibition of MLEC incorporation of [3H]thymidine ranged from 92% (0.25 ng/ml) to 0.3% (0.003 ng/ml), with an IC50 of ∼0.15 ng/ml. Steady-state and agonist-stimulated levels of cytosolic Ca2+ in IMR-90 fibroblasts were determined with the fluorescent probe fura-2. Briefly, IMR-90 cells were grown to confluence on glass coverslips. The cells were then loaded with fura-2/AM (5 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C in physiological saline solution containing 140 mmol/liter NaCl, 5 mmol/liter KCl, 10 mmol/liter HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mmol/liter NaHPO4, 1 mmol/liter CaCl2, 1 MgSO4, and 5 mmol/liter glucose. Cells were washed twice with physiological saline solution without fura-2. The cell-containing coverslips were then placed diagonally in a quartz cuvette that contained physiological saline solution (37 °C), and cytosolic Ca2+ was monitored in real time for ∼15 min as described by Fajtova et al. (32.Fajtova V.T. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: E151-E158PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications (33.Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K.

Fura-2 fluorescence was recorded at 510 nm emission wavelength with excitation monochrometers centered at 350 and 380 nm (in a PTI spectrofluorometer). Stable values were obtained for periods of up to 20 min. Cell fluorescence was corrected for autofluorescence, and the contribution of dye leakage was estimated at <2% with Mn2+. Confluent quiescent fibroblast cultures were stimulated with 100 nmdes-Arg10-kallidin, 100 nm bradykinin, or 1 ng/ml TGF-β as indicated for 16 h in serum-free DMEM supplemented with [3H]proline (2 μCi/ml) and ascorbate (50 μg/ml). The cultures were scraped into phosphate-buffered saline with EDTA (2 mm), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 μm), and hydoxymercuribenzoate (10 μm). The lysates were dialyzed at 4 °C for 48 h, lyophilized, digested with pepsin (10 μg/ml) in 0.5 n acetic acid for 16 h at 4 °C, dialyzed for 48 h at 4 °C, and lyophilized (34.Villanueva A.G. Farber H.W. Rounds S. Goldstein R.H. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The digests were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. Autoradiography was performed as described (35.Bonner W.M. Laskey R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 46: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (5613) Google Scholar). Embryonic human lung fibroblasts (IMR-90) constitutively express both the B1 and B2 receptors (36.Goldstein R.H. Wall M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9263-9268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since activation of the B1 or B2 receptor activates phospholipase C and induces a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ in a number of cell types (37.Bascands J.L. Pecher C. Rouaud S. Emond C. Tack J.L. Bastie M.J. Burch R. Regoli D. Girolami J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F548-F556PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Mathis S.A. Criscimagna N.L. Leeb-Lundberg L.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 128-139PubMed Google Scholar), we monitored cytosolic Ca2+ levels in kinin-stimulated fibroblasts. To activate the B2 receptor, we employed BK or kallidin, both of which are nearly indistinguishable pharmacologically and physiologically. To activate the B1 receptor, we used des-Arg10-kallidin (39.Hess J.F. Derrick A.W. MacNeil T. Borkowski J.A. Immunopharmacology. 1996; 33: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We found that activation of the B1 receptor by des-Arg10-kallidin induced a dose-dependent increase in cytosolic Ca2+ in human lung fibroblasts (Fig.1). Increases in cytosolic Ca2+ were detected at the threshold concentration of 1 nm des-Arg10-kallidin. The maximal increase in cytosolic Ca2+ induced by des-Arg10-kallidin was observed at 100 nm (EC50 = 1.9 nm; r 2 = 0.9871). Activation of the B2 receptor induced an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ that was also dose-dependent (EC50 = 0.7 nm;r 2 = 0.9763) (data not shown). To examine the pharmacology of the kinin receptors, we monitored cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations in kinin-stimulated fibroblasts. In fibroblasts stimulated with the B1 receptor agonist des-Arg10-kallidin, the cytosolic Ca2+increased gradually and returned to base-line levels (Fig.2 A). The B1 receptor antagonist des-Arg10,Leu9-kallidin did not induce an increase in cytosolic Ca2+, but did block the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ stimulated by des-Arg10-kallidin. However, the kallidin-stimulated increase in cytosolic Ca2+ was not affected by des-Arg10,Leu9-kallidin (Fig. 2 B). In fibroblasts stimulated with 1 nm kallidin, cytosolic Ca2+ levels increased sharply and remained elevated (Fig.2 C). The B2 receptor-specific antagonist (HOE 140) did not stimulate an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ or interfere with the Ca2+ movement induced by des-Arg10-kallidin. Conversely, the kallidin-stimulated increase in cytosolic Ca2+ was blocked by 1 μm HOE 140 (Fig. 2 D). We conclude that des-Arg10-kallidin stimulates an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ via exclusive engagement of the B1 receptor.Figure 2Effect of B1 receptor antagonist. IMR-90 fibroblasts were grown on glass coverslips, incubated in DMEM supplemented with 0.4% FBS for 24 h, and loaded with fura-2 as described under “Materials and Methods.” The 340/380 nm emission ratios are presented.

BK did not stimulate type I collagen production, whereas des-Arg10-kallidin stimulated an increase in type I collagen production. As previously reported, TGF-β is a potent stimulus of type I collagen production (36.Goldstein R.H. Wall M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9263-9268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Type I collagen is composed of two α1(I) collagen peptides and one α2(I) collagen peptide. Presented in Fig.3 are radiolabeled α1(I) and α2(I) collagen peptides resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We determined that des-Arg10-kallidin stimulated an increase in both α1(I) and α2(I) collagen peptides proportionally. We examined the modulation of steady-state α1(I) collagen mRNA levels by kinins. BK did not stimulate an increase in α1(I) collagen mRNA. However, in fibroblasts stimulated with des-Arg10-kallidin, there was an increase in α1(I) collagen mRNA (Fig. 4 A). Variations in RNA loading were monitored by expression of GAPDH mRNA. A narrow dose-response relationship was found for the des-Arg10-kallidin-stimulated increase in α1(I) collagen mRNA (Fig. 4 B). At concentrations <1 nmdes-Arg10-kallidin, we did not detect any changes in α1(I) collagen mRNA. Maximal stimulation occurred at concentrations >10 nm. Kinetic studies detected increases in α1(I) collagen mRNA beginning at 4 h, with a maximum response at 24 h (Fig. 4 C). In contrast, neither des-Arg10-kallidin nor kallidin induced an increase in fibronectin mRNA (data not shown). TGF-β mediates increases in collagen synthesis induced by other G-protein-coupled receptor agonists, including angiotensin II (40.Gibbons G.H. Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) and thromboxane (41.Studer R.K. Negrete H. Craven P.A. DeRubertis F.R. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 422-430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We determined the amount of active TGF-β present in the culture medium from untreated and des-Arg10-kallidin-treated fibroblasts using the bioassay in which MLEC growth was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by active TGF-β. The medium from des-Arg10-kallidin-stimulated fibroblasts was added to MLEC cultures, and [3H]thymidine incorporation was monitored (Table I). The medium from untreated and des-Arg10-kallidin-stimulated fibroblasts contained small but similar amounts of TGF-β. The values were interpolated from a TGF-β inhibition standard curve. The amount of active TGF-β in the medium from des-Arg10-kallidin-stimulated fibroblasts (0.38 ± 0.053 ng/ml) was not statistically different from the control values (p > 0.05). Des-Arg10-kallidin (1 μm) did not alter MLEC growth, nor did the presence of des-Arg10-kallidin (1 μm) alter TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition (data not shown).Table ITGF-β content of conditioned mediaCultureTGF-β contentng/ml ± S.D.Control0.30 ± 0.062 (n = 10)Des-Arg10-kallidin-stimulated0.38 ± 0.053 (n = 10)Confluent quiescent IMR-90 fibroblasts were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in serum-free DMEM with or without 100 nm des-Arg10-kallidin for 24 h.

Open table in a new tab Confluent quiescent IMR-90 fibroblasts were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in serum-free DMEM with or without 100 nm des-Arg10-kallidin for 24 h. The medium was removed, centrifuged to remove non-adherent cells, and stored at −70 °C. The TGF-β content of the conditioned medium was determined in triplicate as described under “Results” and reported as the mean ± S.D. for 10 independent experiments. To determine whether des-Arg10-kallidin amplifies the TGF-β signaling mechanism, we employed the luciferase reporter p3TP-LUX, which is activated by TGF-β via Smad signaling (42.Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts that were transiently transfected with p3TP-LUX, TGF-β stimulated transcription from p3TP-LUX, as indicated by increased luciferase activity. Des-Arg10-kallidin did not stimulate an increase in luciferase activity. In cultures stimulated with both TGF-β and des-Arg10-kallidin, the luciferase activity was comparable to the luciferase activity in cultures stimulated with TGF-β alone (Fig. 5). We conclude that the des-Arg10-kallidin-stimulated increase in α1(I) collagen mRNA is mediated through a mechanism that does not increase the amount of active TGF-β or amplify the intracellular signal generated by TGF-β. At this time, we do not exclude the possibility that des-Arg10-kallidin amplifies non-SMAD-mediated TGF-β signaling. In human lung fibroblasts, des-Arg10-kallidin stimulates proliferation (36.Goldstein R.H. Wall M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9263-9268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and increased levels of α1(I) collagen mRNA (Fig. 4 A). Since TGF-β stimulates extracellular matrix protein synthesis and proliferation in fibroblasts through de novo synthesis of CTGF (26.Grotendorst G.R. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), we examined the effects of kinins on the steady-state levels of CTGF mRNA (Fig.6 A). TGF-β stimulated an increase in CTGF mRNA, and activation of the B2 receptor did not induce a change in CTGF mRNA levels. In contrast, activation of the B1 receptor by des-Arg10-kallidin stimulated an increase in CTGF mRNA. As with α1(I) collagen mRNA, the des-Arg10-kallidin-stimulated increase in CTGF mRNA was dose-dependent (Fig. 6 B). For the dose-response studies, fibroblasts were stimulated with des-Arg10-kallidin ranging from 10 pm to 1 μm. Maximal increases in CTGF mRNA were observed at concentrations of des-Arg10-kallidin >10 nm. The des-Arg10-kallidin response was further characterized in a time course study. Total RNA was harvested at various time points (2–24 h). Increases in CTGF mRNA levels were detected at 2 h, with a maximum response at 4 h (Fig. 6 C). At 24 h, the level of CTGF mRNA returned to basal levels. As demonstrated with the des-Arg10-kallidin-stimulated increase in cytosolic Ca2+, the B1 receptor antagonist des-Arg10,Leu9-kallidin attenuated the des-Arg10-kallidin-induced increase in CTGF mRNA. In contrast to des-Arg10-kallidin, des-Arg10,Leu9-kallidin did not induce an increase in CTGF mRNA (Fig.7 A). However, when the fibroblasts were preincubated with the B1 receptor antagonist des-Arg10,Leu9-kallidin (1 μm) and then stimulated with des-Arg10-kallidin (100 nm), the increase in CTGF mRNA was reduced. We previously reported that TGF-β stimulates transcription of CTGF (43.Ricupero D.A. Rishikof D.C. Kuang P.P. Poliks C.F. Goldstein R.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L1165-L1171PubMed Google Scholar). When transcription was blocked with actinomycin D, there were reduced basal levels of CTGF mRNA, indicating that CTGF mRNA was constitutively transcribed in quiescent fibroblasts (Fig.7 B). As previously reported, actinomycin D blocks the TGF-β-stimulated transcription of CTGF (43.Ricupero D.A. Rishikof D.C. Kuang P.P. Poliks C.F. Goldstein R.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L1165-L1171PubMed Google Scholar). However, the des-Arg10-kallidin-stimulated increase in CTGF mRNA was not blocked by actinomycin D, indicating that the des-Arg10-kallidin-induced increase in CTGF mRNA is due to stabilization of the message. Studies on the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) mRNA indicated that inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide (CHX) or short-term treatment with TPA induces stabilization of GM-CSF mRNA (44.Akashi M. Shaw G. Gross M. Saito M. Koeffler H.P. Blood. 1991; 78: 2005-2012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We characterized the des-Arg10-kallidin response by blocking protein synthesis with CHX. TGF-β signaling was not affected by inhibition of protein synthesis. In fibroblasts incubated with either CHX or des-Arg10-kallidin, there was an increase in CTGF mRNA. Furthermore, in fibroblasts stimulated with both CHX and des-Arg10-kallidin, CTGF mRNA levels increased in an additive manner, suggesting that the des-Arg10-kallidin response does not involve inhibition of protein synthesis (Fig.7 C). We further characterized the des-Arg10-kallidin-induced stabilization of CTGF mRNA by pretreating the fibroblasts with TPA (100 nm, 10 min). TPA alone did not alter the basal levels of CTGF mRNA or alter the TGF-β response. However, TPA attenuated the des-Arg10-kallidin response (Fig. 7 D). In vivo, the B1 receptor is detected in low abundance in normal tissues and is up-regulated following exposure to pro-inflammatory agents via nuclear factor κB activation. In the studies presented here, we utilized human embryonic lung fibroblasts that constitutively express the B1 receptor. Our results do not require up-regulation of B1 receptor number since treatment with actinomycin D or CHX does not inhibit the des-Arg10-kallidin-induced increase in CTGF mRNA. Since each of these agents prevents de novo synthesis of the B1 receptor, it appears that the number of receptors constitutively expressed by the fibroblasts is sufficient for signaling Exogenous administration of B1 and B2 receptor agonists in vivo and in vitro generates responses that appear qualitatively similar. For example, both the B1 and B2 receptors mediate pain perception (45.Whalley E.T. Clegg S. Stewart J.M. Vavrek R.J. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1987; 336: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); both receptors activate phospholipase C in mesangial cells (46.Issandou M. Darbon J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21037-21043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and both receptors stimulate mitogenesis in fibroblasts (36.Goldstein R.H. Wall M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9263-9268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the structural similarities of the B1 and B2 receptor agonists suggest that the kinin receptors may be isoforms. However, our Ca2+ studies clearly demonstrate that the physiological effects mediated by the B1 and B2 receptor systems are distinct. These findings, together with the low homology between the receptors (36% at the amino acid level) and the patterns of expression, indicate that the kinin receptors have distinct physiological and cellular responses. Engagement of the B1 or B2 receptor affects extracellular matrix deposition, but in different ways. Activation of the B2 receptor stimulates synthesis of nitric oxide and prostaglandins in fibroblasts (47.Cahill M. Fishman J.B. Polgar P. Agents Actions. 1988; 24: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), release of histamine from mast cells (48.Johnson A.R. Erdos E.G. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1973; 142: 1252-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), and release of substance P and neurokinin A from sensory neurons (49.Saria A. Martling C.R. Yan Z. Theodorsson-Norheim E. Gamse R. Lundberg J.M. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1988; 137: 1330-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), processes that can be considered anti-fibrotic. Our data demonstrate that activation of the B2 receptor does not stimulate collagen or CTGF synthesis. However, activation of the B1 receptor by des-Arg10-kallidin stimulates type I collagen protein synthesis, increases α1(I) collagen mRNA, and stabilizes CTGF mRNA. TGF-β and now des-Arg10-kallidin are the only known stimulators of CTGF production. The rate of mRNA degradation is determined, for the most part, by the activity of destabilizing sequences, although stabilizing sequences have been reported (50.Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8123-8132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Destabilizing sequences have been found in the 5′-untranslated region (51.Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar) and in the coding sequences (52.Yen T.J. Gay D.A. Pachter J.S. Cleveland D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1224-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, cytokine mRNA degradation is mediated through increased exonuclease activity, which appears to be regulated through adenine/uridine-rich elements found in the 3′-untranslated region (53.Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3103) Google Scholar). GM-CSF mRNA stabilization is well characterized. The GM-CSF 3′-untranslated region contains several elements consisting of core AUUUA pentamers. Proteins bind to AUUUA pentamers and appear to recruit other proteins, resulting in increased exonuclease activity. Inhibition of protein synthesis by CHX induces an increase in GM-CSF mRNA stability, presumably by inhibiting synthesis of destabilizing proteins (54.Bohjanen P.R. Petryniak B. June C.H. Thompson C.B. Lindsten T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3288-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The CTGF 3′-untranslated region (996 nucleotides) contains three AUUUA pentamers that potentially bind proteins involved in message destabilization. Each AUUUA pentamer forms the core for nonamers that are highly homologous to UUAUUU(U/A)(U/A), which is reported to destabilize mRNA (55.Lagnado C.A. Brown C.Y. Goodall G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7984-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The mechanism that induces stabilization of GM-CSF mRNA appears to be distinct from the mechanism that stabilizes CTGF mRNA. In the studies presented here, CHX induces an increase in CTGF mRNA levels at 6 h. The CHX-induced increase in CTGF mRNA is not sensitive to inhibition of transcription by actinomycin D (data not shown), suggesting that CHX induces an increase in CTGF mRNA stability by inhibiting synthesis of destabilizing proteins. CHX could inhibit specific RNases; however, GAPDH mRNA was not altered by CHX. Co-stimulation with CHX and des-Arg10-kallidin further increased the amount of CTGF mRNA, suggesting that the mechanisms by which CHX and des-Arg10-kallidin induced an increase in CTGF mRNA are distinct. Furthermore, TPA differentially regulates the stabilization of CTGF mRNA and GM-CSF mRNA. Human lung fibroblasts (WI38) exposed to TPA for 10 min exhibit increased GM-CSF mRNA stability (44.Akashi M. Shaw G. Gross M. Saito M. Koeffler H.P. Blood. 1991; 78: 2005-2012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our system, TPA did not stabilize CTGF mRNA. In fact, TPA attenuated the B1 receptor-mediated stabilization of CTGF mRNA. It is possible that the divergent TPA effects are cell type-specific. The data presented are consistent with the interpretation that CTGF mRNA is destabilized through labile destabilizing protein(s) that binds to the AUUUA elements and that recruits RNases and other cytoplasmic proteins. CHX blocks synthesis of the putative destabilizing protein(s), thus attenuating destabilization. Des-Arg10-kallidin induces stabilization of CTGF mRNA through post-translational modifications of the existing destabilizing proteins. The des-Arg10-kallidin-mediated post-translational modifications may reduce the RNA binding affinity of the destabilizing proteins or sterically hinder the complex formation of destabilizing proteins with other cytosolic proteins. The net result of stimulation with des-Arg10-kallidin is an increase in the message stability. Activation of the B2 receptor by BK and kallidin is an integral part of the early events of wound repair, mediating such processes as edema, pain perception, and release or synthesis of pro-inflammatory factors (3.Regoli D. Barabe J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1980; 32: 1-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). When the possible contribution of the B2 receptor to fibrogenesis was examined, it was found that activation of the B2 receptor does not stimulate an increase in type I collagen production (36.Goldstein R.H. Wall M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9263-9268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Now it appears that the B1 receptor system plays a distinct role in wound repair, causing a rise in cytosolic Ca2+, stabilizing CTGF mRNA, stimulating an increase in α1(I) collagen mRNA, and stimulating collagen production. The potential pathophysiological role of the B1 receptor in the development of fibrosis is intriguing. The B1 receptor is up-regulated at sites of inflammation and appears to be refractory to desensitization (1.Marceau F. Hess J.F. Bachvarov D.R. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 357-386PubMed Google Scholar). These characteristics, together with the pro-fibrotic effects reported here, suggest that activation of the B1 receptor may contribute to the excess collagen deposition associated with chronic inflammatory conditions such as asthma and pulmonary fibrosis."

The products of the RAG1 andRAG2 genes are the lymphoid-specific factors responsible for the initiation of the V(D)J recombination through the generation of a DNA double strand break. RAG1 or RAG2 gene inactivation in the mouse leads to abortion of the V(D)J rearrangement process, early block in both T and B cell maturation, and, ultimately, to severe combined immune deficiency (SCID). A human SCID condition is also characterized by an absence of mature T and B lymphocytes and is associated with mutations in either RAG1- orRAG2-encoding genes. Based on the predicted β-propeller three-dimensional structure model for RAG2, we found that six out of the seven mutations described to date in T-B-SCID patients are clustered on one side of the propeller, in regions exposed to solvent.

D, and J, variable, diversity, and joining segments, respectively 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside severe combined immune deficiency Immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes are composed of variable (V),1 diversity (D), and joining (J) segments, which undergo somatic rearrangements prior to their expression. This process is completed by the V(D)J recombinase and can be roughly divided into two phases (reviewed in Ref. 1.Grawunder U. West R.B. Lieber M.R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). During the initial step, the lymphoid-specific proteins RAG1 and RAG2 recognize recombination-specific sequences that flank all V, D, and J gene segments and introduce a DNA double strand break at the border of the recombination-specific sequence (2.Schatz D.G. Semin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 3.Ramsden D.A. Vangent D.C. Gellert M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the general DNA repair machinery is recruited to resolve the double strand break and complete the V(D)J rearrangement (4.Jackson S.P. Jeggo P.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 412-415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The critical role of RAG1 and RAG2 has been first recognized from gene inactivation experiments in the mouse (5.Shinkai Y. Rathbun G. Lam K.P. Oltz E.M. Stewart V. Mendelsohn M. Charron J. Datta M. Young F. Stall A.M. Alt F.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 855-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2179) Google Scholar, 6.Mombaerts P. Iacomini J. Johnson R.S. Herrup K. Tonegawa S. Papaionnou V.E. Cell. 1992; 68: 869-877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2327) Google Scholar). The absence of either one results in an early block in both T and B cell maturation leading to severe combined immune deficiency (T-B- SCID). In humans, about 20% of SCID patients lack T and B lymphocytes but have normal natural killer cell counts (7.Fischer A. Cavazzana-Calvo M. de Saint Basile G. de Villartay J.P. Di Santo J.P. Hivroz C. Rieux-Laucat F. Le Deist F. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 93-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). These patients can be further divided into two groups. Some patients have been found to carry mutations in either the RAG1- or theRAG2-encoding genes, which compromise the early step of the V(D)J recombination (8.Schwarz K. Gauss G.H. Ludwig L. Pannicke U. Li Z. Lindner D. Friedrich W. Seger R.A. Hansenhagge T.E. Desiderio S. Lieber M.R. Bartram C.R. Science. 1996; 274: 97-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Other patients are characterized by an increased radiosensitivity of their bone marrow cells and fibroblasts (RS-SCID) (9.Nicolas N. Moshous D. Papadopoulo D. Cavazzana-Calvo M. de Chasseval R. le Deist F. Fischer A. de Villartay J.P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 10.Nicolas N. Finnie N.J. Cavazzana-Calvo M.

Invest. 1993; 91: 1214-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), supporting the hypothesis of a defect in the last step of the V(D)J recombination in one of the genes involved in DNA repair. Last, a residual activity of RAG1 or RAG2 caused by leaky mutations has been described in patients with Omenn syndrome (12.Villa A. Santagata S. Bozzi F. Giliani S. Frattini A. Imberti L. Gatta L.B. Ochs H.D. Schwarz K. Notarangelo L.D. Vezzoni P. Spanopoulou E. Cell. 1998; 93: 885-896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). This condition is characterized by an absence of circulating B cells but the presence of highly restricted and activated T lymphocytes that infiltrate the gut and the skin (13.Rieux-Laucat F. Bahadoran P. Brousse N. Selz F. Fischer A. Le Deist F. de Villartay J.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 312-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The RAG1- and RAG2-encoding genes were cloned about 10 years ago, and many advances in the understanding of their function have been achieved recently through the development of nearly complete V(D)J reactions in vitro in acellular models (for a review, see Ref. 2.Schatz D.G. Semin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Several important issues still remain unresolved, one of which is the respective role of RAG1 and RAG2 in the recombination reaction and the recognition of the catalytic site of the RAG1-RAG2 complex. The description of RAG1/RAG2mutations resulting in the SCID phenotype in humans is of great value in trying to build structure-function relationships for these two proteins. We present here three new RAG2 mutations and show that six out of seven described RAG2 mutations in human SCID or Omenn patients are clustered in the same predicted three-dimensional region, thought to be involved in RAG1-RAG2 interaction. Both patients (patients 10 and 41) analyzed in this study presented with a typical phenotype of autosomal recessive SCID with no circulating T cells and B cells, while natural killer cells were present. Patient 10, but not patient 41, originated from a consanguineous family. Informed consent was obtained from the patients' parents prior to this study. RAG2 coding sequence was amplified by polymerase chain reaction on genomic DNA obtained from whole blood using R2F1B 5′-CGGATCCATGTGAAGGAATCTAAATA and R2R1X 5′-GCTCTAGACTAAAAGAAAACATAGGCA primers and the Expand High Fidelity polymerase chain reaction system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Nucleotide primers were chosen on the HuRAG2 sequence from Ref. 14.Ichihara Y. Hirai M. Kurosawa Y. Immunol. Lett. 1992; 33: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar. Polymerase chain reaction products were directly sequenced using internal primers and the dRhodamine terminator cycle sequencing kit (ABI). For functional V(D)J recombination assays, polymerase chain reaction products were subcloned into pcDNA1.1 (Invitrogen) asBamHI–XbaI fragments. RAG2 expression constructs were resequenced to confirm the presence of the patient's mutation and the absence of Taq polymerase misincorporation. Full-length RAG2 proteins are rapidly degraded during the cell cycle, making them difficult to detect by Western blot. To analyze the integrity of the RAG2 mutated proteins, core regions of wild type and mutant RAG2, which lack the specific degradation signal, were cloned into pmR2ΔC (a generous gift of E. Spanopoulou) in place of the murine RAG2 sequence. In this construct, the RAG2 core protein is fused to glutathione S-transferase and expressed under the control of the strong EF1α promoter. The expressed fusion protein was then detected using an anti-glutathioneS-transferase antibody. These constructs were introduced into 293T cells by CaPO4 precipitation. 48 h following transfection, cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1% SDS, and the cellular extract was boiled for 5 min and clarified by centrifugation. 100 μg of protein were loaded onto 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The V(D)J recombination assay was carried out in fibroblasts as described previously (9.Nicolas N. Moshous D. Papadopoulo D. Cavazzana-Calvo M. de Chasseval R. le Deist F. Fischer A. de Villartay J.P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 106 exponentially growing HeLa or SV40-transformed human fibroblasts were electroporated in 400 μl of complete culture medium with 6 μg of RAG1- and 4.8 μg ofRAG2-encoding plasmids, carrying either the wild type or mutated sequences, together with 2.5 μg of either pHRecCJ (coding joint) or pHRecSJ (signal joint) V(D)J extrachromosomal substrates. These plasmids carry a lacZ gene interrupted by a stuffer DNA flanked by recombination-specific sequences. Upon V(D)J-mediated recombination, the stuffer DNA is excised, and the lacZ gene is reassembled. 48 h after transfection, extrachromosomal DNA was prepared by rapid alkaline lysis and used for transfection of DH10B bacteria. The percentage of recombination was determined by plating bacteria in the presence of X-gal and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and counting blue colonies relative to white colonies. The model of the β-propeller structure for the first 350 amino acids of RAG2 has been previously described through “hydrophobic cluster analysis” and alignment of the RAG2 sequence repeats constituting the structural unit of the propeller with repeats belonging to the kelch family including those of the galactose oxidase (15.Callebaut I. Mornon J.P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 880-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the galactose oxidase has been experimentally determined (PDB:1GOF) and consists of a 7-fold symmetry β-propeller. However, in order to restore the 6-fold symmetry predicted for the RAG2 propeller, we used as template the six-bladed propeller of influenza A neuraminidase (Protein Data Bank code 1NCC; NRAM_IATRA), whose β-strands of each blade have been fitted on the predicted β-strand of RAG2. All modeling procedures were carried out using MODELLER4 (16.Sali A. Potterton L. Yuan F. van Vlijmen H. Karplus M. Proteins. 1995; 23: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Two classes of T-B-SCID patients have been described that can be distinguished based on the affected step of the V(D)J recombination process. Genetic linkage analysis performed in the patient 10 family by using polymorphic markers surrounding the RAG1-RAG2 locus on human chromosome 11 was consistent with the possible existence ofRAG1/RAG2 mutation in patient 10 (data not shown). Indeed, sequencing of the RAG2 coding region revealed a homozygous G1305T transversion leading to an R35V substitution. This mutation was found to be heterozygous in both parents (data not shown). TheRAG2 gene was directly sequenced as a candidate gene in patient 41, originating from a nonconsanguineous family. Patient 41 carried two missense mutations in the RAG2 gene: an A1316G transversion causing an R39G amino acid substitution and a G1887A transversion leading to an R229E substitution. Interestingly, another replacement (Gln) of the same Arg229 residue has been previously described in a T-B-SCID patient (8.Schwarz K. Gauss G.H. Ludwig L. Pannicke U. Li Z. Lindner D. Friedrich W. Seger R.A. Hansenhagge T.E. Desiderio S. Lieber M.R. Bartram C.R. Science. 1996; 274: 97-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The RAG1 and RAG2 proteins are very well conserved through evolution, suggesting that any amino acid change may potentially compromise the activity of the resulting protein. However, one cannot formally rule out the possibility of silent mutations. The functionality of the three identified RAG2 mutants was therefore assessed in a fibroblast-based V(D)J recombination assay (9.Nicolas N. Moshous D. Papadopoulo D. Cavazzana-Calvo M. de Chasseval R. le Deist F. Fischer A. de Villartay J.P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In this assay, a reporter construct consisting of the lacZ gene disrupted by a recombination-specific sequence-flanked stuffer DNA, is introduced into fibroblasts together with RAG1- andRAG2-expressing plasmids. If the reporter plasmid undergoes V(D)J recombination, the lacZ gene is reconstituted and can be monitored into bacteria upon plating on X-gal-containing plates. The number of blue colonies is then indicative of a successful recombination of the construct as shown for the wild typeRAG2 construct in Table I. In contrast, the V(D)J recombinase activity was totally abolished when the three mutated forms of RAG2 were introduced, since virtually no blue colonies could be recovered in assays testing for the formation of either the coding joint (pHRecCJ) or the signal joint (pHRecSJ) (Table I). The absence of V(D)J recombination activity was not due to a degradation of the mutant RAG2 proteins as shown by Western blot (Fig.1) for R229E and R39G. This analysis confirmed that the three identified mutations are directly responsible for the SCID phenotype in the two patients studied here and brings to seven the number of described missense mutations in the RAG2 gene that lead to T-B-SCID or Omenn syndrome in humans.Table IV(D)J recombination assayphRecCJ (coding joints)phRecSJ (signal joints)Blue coloniesTotalRaR (coding joints) = 3 × (blue colonies)/(total) × 1,000.Blue coloniesTotalRbR (signal joints) = (blue colonies)/(total) × 1,000. 1 and 2 represent two separate experiments.×10 −3×10 −3Wild type Expt. 1cExpt., experiment.6116,08011.381437,59018.8 Expt. 23660,0001.852160,0000.32Mutants Gly35VExpt. 11170,0000.0180200,000<0.005Expt. 2093,000<0.010120,000<0.008 R39GExpt. 1024,000<0.0408,760<0.1Expt. 2040,320<0.02NDdND, not done.

Open table in a new tab The use of sensitive methods of sequence analysis, including the bidimensional hydrophobic cluster analysis, for the analysis of the RAG2 protein sequence revealed two distinct globular domains separated by a hinge region of 60 amino acids (15.Callebaut I. Mornon J.P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 880-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The largest domain encompasses the first 350 amino acid residues and covers the previously defined active core of RAG2. Further examination of the hydrophobic cluster analysis profile for this domain highlighted the existence of a 6-fold-repeated motif of about 50 amino acids, which was conserved in the RAG2 core from several species. Careful analysis of the sequence of the active core strongly suggested that the RAG2 repeats belong to the kelch family of motifs, which consist of several equivalent four-stranded β-sheets arranged in a circular way like blades of a propeller (β-propeller structure). An approximate model for the structure of the predicted six-bladed β-propeller of RAG2 is presented in Fig.2, based on the previous alignment with the galactose oxidase (15.Callebaut I. Mornon J.P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 880-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), a member of the kelch family whose structure has been experimentally determined (PDB:1GOF), and on further alignment with the six-bladed propeller of influenza A neuraminidase (PDB:1NCC) to restore the 6-fold symmetry as the β-propeller from the galactose oxidase contains seven blades. The six predicted blades are labeled a–f, according to the sequence progression, with blade f including the three C-terminal strands β1, β2, and β3, and N-terminal strand β4, thereby providing the circular closure of the blade arrangement. In Fig. 2 B, a top representation is presented, whereas a 90° view is presented in Fig.2 C. One can see that each blade is made of four β-strands separated by loops of various lengths. The β-strands participate in the globular core of the propeller structure, while the loops, especially the 2.3 loops, extend outside of the structure and are exposed to solvent. Because of this particular structure, β-propellers are generally considered as general scaffold proteins with a conserved structural core and variable sequences on the outside loops. As such, these structures are widely involved in protein-protein interactions through the relatively flat surfaces they present on either side. We determined which regions of this predicted three-dimensional model of the core RAG2 harbored the variousRAG2 mutations described to date (Fig. 2 C). Most surprisingly, six out of the seven identified mutations are located in the β-propeller structure of RAG2, clustered in the same area of the predicted three-dimensional model. Indeed, all of these mutations are present either at the very beginning of block 3, just before the position of the predicted strands β3 (C41W, R229Q, R229E, and M285R) or within the 2.3 loop linking strand β2 to strand β3 (G35V and R39G). The six mutations, which are localized on the region of the β-propeller structure exposed to solvent, on the same side of the scaffold, indicate that this region of the RAG2 protein is absolutely critical for functional activity. The C41W and M285R substitutions were previously found to significantly reduce the interaction between RAG1 and RAG2 in vitro (12.Villa A. Santagata S. Bozzi F. Giliani S. Frattini A. Imberti L. Gatta L.B. Ochs H.D. Schwarz K. Notarangelo L.D. Vezzoni P. Spanopoulou E. Cell. 1998; 93: 885-896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). As a possible consequence, these two mutants gave no detectable DNA binding activity of the RAG1-RAG2 complex (12.Villa A. Santagata S. Bozzi F. Giliani S. Frattini A. Imberti L. Gatta L.B. Ochs H.D. Schwarz K. Notarangelo L.D. Vezzoni P. Spanopoulou E. Cell. 1998; 93: 885-896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the hypothesis of the role of RAG2 in stabilizing the complex (17.Akamatsu Y. Oettinger M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4670-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 18.Mo X. Bailin T. Sadofsky M.J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 19: 3674-3683Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). According to the β-propeller predictive model, the Cys41 and Met285 residues, which are located quite far apart on the primary structure, are spatially arranged close to each other, which now makes it easier to conceive the biological significance of their modification. One cannot however formally exclude the possibility that these mutations compromise the function of RAG2 because of a general folding alteration of the protein rather than the modification of residues directly involved in RAG1-RAG2 interaction. Altogether, this predictive model and the positioned mutations found in T-B-SCID patients suggest that the β-propeller structure of RAG2 serves as a scaffold on one side of which the RAG1 protein interacts. According to this hypothesis, it is interesting to note the strikingly large length of the 2.3 loop c, suggesting that residues on this loop, protruding at the surface of the propeller, may directly interact with RAG1 amino acids and thus help to stabilize the interaction between the two proteins. Although the crystal structure for RAG2 is not yet available, some of us and others have proposed a β-propeller structure for the core domain of RAG2 between amino acids 1 and 350, based on hydrophobic cluster analysis (15.Callebaut I. Mornon J.P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 880-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and other computational methods (20.Aravind L. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 1023-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). This type of analysis proved to be very powerful in the past in predicting the three-dimensional structure of globular regions for many proteins whose sequences did not share, at first sight, any obvious similarities with other proteins, prior to access to definitive three-dimensional data through crystallization. The finding that six out of the sevenRAG2 mutations described to date in T-B-SCID and Omenn patients are positioned on the same side of the beta-propeller model reinforces the biological significance of this predictive model. The extension of this type of analysis to other globular domains of RAG2 and RAG1 should help in deciphering the various functional domains of these two proteins as well as their respective roles in the V(D)J recombination process."

We have now used the known three-dimensional structure of the A1 domain to model the interaction with the GP Ibα sequence 271–279, which has previously been implicated in ligand binding. Docking procedures suggested that A1 domain residues in strand β3 and preceding loop (residues 559–566) as well as in helix α3 (residues 594–603) interact with Asp residues 272, 274, 277 and sulfated Tyr residues 278 and 279 in GP Ibα. To verify this model, 14 mutant A1 domain fragments containing single or multiple side chain substitutions were tested for their ability to mediate platelet adhesion under flow. Each of the vWF residues Tyr565, Glu596, and Lys599proved to be strictly required for A1 domain function, which, in agreement with previous findings, was also dependent on Gly561. Moreover, an accessory functional role was apparent for a group of positively charged residues, including Arg at positions 629, 632, 636 and Lys at positions 643 and 645, possibly acting in concert. There was, however, no evidence from the model that these residues directly participate in forming the complex with GP Ibα. These results provide a partial model of the vWF-GP Ibα interaction linked to the manifestation of functional activity in platelet adhesion.

The interaction between GP Ibα and immobilized vWF can tether platelets to surfaces in rapidly flowing blood but is inherently short-lived, mediating transient periods of arrest that alternate with slow translocation (6.Savage B. Saldivar E. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). During this rolling motion, however, additional synergistic bonds can form through specific integrin receptors and establish firm platelet adhesion to extravascular matrix constituents (6.Savage B.

Cell. 1998; 94: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). The rapid association of GP Ibα with vWF not only initiates platelet deposition at sites of vessel injury but is also essential for maintaining thrombus growth in blood flowing with high shear rates (8.Ruggeri Z.M. Dent J.A. Saldivar E. Blood. 1999; 94: 172-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A detailed explanation of the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes may, therefore, elucidate key regulatory aspects of normal and pathological platelet function as well as indicate new approaches for antithrombotic therapy. The notion that the GP Ibα binding site is located between vWF residues 449 and 728 (9.Fujimura Y. Titani K. Holland L.Z. Russell S.R. Roberts J.R. Elder J.H. Ruggeri Z.M. Zimmerman T.S. J. Biol.

Since then, studies attempting to identify A1 domain residues involved in interacting with the receptor have yielded inconclusive and sometimes conflicting results (13.Mohri H. Fujimura Y. Shima M.

One reason for this outcome is that the assays employed to evaluate the association between vWF and GP Ibα have typically used exogenous modulators such as ristocetin (17.Howard M.A. Firkin B.G. Thromb. Haemost. 1971; 26: 362-369Crossref Scopus (386) Google Scholar) and botrocetin (18.Read M.S. Shermer R.W. Brinkhous K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 6586-6593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recently, however, evidence has been presented that a recombinant A1 domain fragment can function as intact vWF in tethering rolling platelets to a surface in a flow field with high shear rate (23.Miyata S. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6586-6593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This method may be used to evaluate the consequences of specific vWF mutations without the confounding presence of exogenous modulators and, complemented by modeling procedures based on the available A1 domain crystal structure (24.Celikel R. Varughese K.I. Madhusudan A. Yoshioka A. Ware J. Ruggeri Z.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), may provide initial information on individual residues involved in receptor binding. Such an approach is valuable since the atomic structure of functional GP Ibα and vWF fragments in complex is not available. Here we present the results of a study based on docking a limited GP Ibα sequence, previously shown to contain residues involved in ligand binding (25.Vicente V. Houghten R.A. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 274-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Murata M. Ware J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 9571-9578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), onto the A1 domain three-dimensional structure. Selected vWF residues thus predicted to establish contact with the receptor were mutated in recombinant A1 domain fragments that were then tested for the ability to support platelet tethering in flowing blood. The functional changes caused by these mutations define the location of a putative GP Ibα binding interface in vWF. The coordinates of the complex between vWF A1 domain and the monoclonal antibody NMC-4 are deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession number 1OAK. The GP Ibα sequence GDTDLYDYY was selected for docking onto the vWF A1 domain because of its experimentally proven involvement in ligand binding (25.Vicente V. Houghten R.A. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 274-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Murata M. Ware J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol.

Molecules were constructed and visualized with INSIGHTII (release 95.0 with Builder, Biopolymer, and Discover modules; Biosym/Molecular Simulations Inc.). The presumed conformation of the YDYY sequence in the GP Ibα peptide was derived from analysis of known structures in the Protein Data Bank data base, namely 1GOX(residues 22–25), 1HYT (residues 81–84), and 1NPC (residues 82–85). The three-dimensional conformation of the YDYY sequence in these proteins was similar, as shown by a root mean square deviation in the position of all atoms of less than 0.3 Å. The starting coordinates for the docking procedure were taken from 1GOX. The remaining portion of the GP Ibα peptide was built one residue at a time, and the conformation was optimized by energy minimization using X-PLOR (28.Brunger A.T. X-PLOR Crystallographic Program Suite, Version 3.851. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1996Google Scholar). In these calculations, each new peptide unit was treated as completely flexible, whereas only 2–4 torsion angles at a time were allowed to vary in the YDYY sequence. In subsequent cycles, torsion angles that had been kept fixed were allowed to vary. The choice of an initial conformation for the YDYY portion of the GP Ibα peptide reduced the complexity of calculations, but no portion of the peptide was treated as rigid, thus eliminating or reducing bias. The three Tyr residues in the sequence were constructed both with and without sulfation. The latter post-translational modification is thought to occur on all three residues in the native protein and to be necessary for normal function (27.Marchese P. Murata M. Mazzucato M. Pradella P.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13946-13953Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The geometry of the three sulfated tyrosine residues was refined using X-PLOR (28.Brunger A.T. X-PLOR Crystallographic Program Suite, Version 3.851. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1996Google Scholar). Docking of the GP Ibα peptide onto vWF was performed with AUTODOCK, release 2.4 (30.Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Huey R. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1996; 10: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). This program uses Monte Carlo simulated annealing procedures to explore a wide range of conformational states. In our case, the vWF A1 domain molecule was kept fixed throughout the simulation while the GP Ibα peptide was subjected to random movement in the space around the protein accompanied by changes in its conformation. At each step in the simulation, a small random displacement was applied to each of the internal and external degrees of freedom of the peptide, involving translation of its center of gravity, orientation with respect to the vWF A1 domain, and rotation around each of its flexible dihedral angles. The energy resulting from the new conformation of the peptide and its interaction with the A1 domain was evaluated. This value was accepted as valid if lower than the one obtained in the preceding cycle of the simulation, resulting in a final conformation with the lowest energy of interaction between the GP Ibα peptide and the vWF A1 domain. Intermolecular contacts were generated with CONTACSYM (31.Sheriff S. Silverton E.W. Padlan E.A. Cohen G.H. Smith-Gill S.J. Finzel B.C. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Refolding before use was achieved by slow dialysis with incremental pH increase in steps of 0.5 units each, up to a final value of 5.0 (23.Miyata S. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol.

Protein concentration was determined with the micro-BCA assay (Pierce) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The molecular mass of each purified protein was verified by mass spectroscopy and found to be in accordance with the predicted sequence. All fragments had comparable behavior upon analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing and nonreducing conditions, indicating that they contained the Cys509–Cys695intrachain disulfide bond (34.Miyata S.

They all migrated as a single band with apparent molecular mass of 39 kDa in oxidized form and were soluble up to a concentration of at least 0.5 mg/ml. Wild type and mutant recombinant vWF fragments were immobilized onto glass coverslips using solutions in 20 mmHEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. The coating protein concentration was 100 μg/ml and was previously shown to ensure saturation of the surface with all the fragments tested (23.Miyata S. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6586-6593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Blood was collected from healthy, medication-free donors into polypropylene syringes containing the α-thrombin inhibitord-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine chloromethyl ketone dihydrochloride (PPACK) as anticoagulant (50 μm final concentration). All human subjects participating in these studies were aware of the experimental nature of the research and gave their informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. To eliminate potential confounding effects of plasma vWF, perfusion studies were performed with blood cells removed from plasma and resuspended in an equivalent volume of modified HEPES-Tyrode buffer, pH 7.4, containing 50 mg/ml bovine serum albumin fraction V (Calbiochem) and 5 mm EDTA (23.Miyata S. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6586-6593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Moreover, the platelet count in the cell suspension was lowered to a value between 9,000 and 12,000/μl to decrease interacting platelets on the surface and facilitate quantitative image analysis. This was achieved by centrifuging the cell suspension at 150 × g for 15 min, removing the platelet-rich supernatant fluid, and replacing it with an equivalent volume of HEPES-Tyrode buffer. Platelets were then counted in both the whole cell and the platelet-rich suspensions, and appropriate volumes of the latter were added into the former to obtain the target count in the reconstituted blood, at the same time maintaining a normal hematocrit. Alternatively, if the platelet count was still too high, the centrifugation step was repeated. Interactions between surface-bound vWF A1 domain and platelet GP Ibα in flowing blood were observed in real-time by epifluorescence videomicroscopy using an Axiovert 135 inverted microscope with a 40× objective (Zeiss) after labeling blood cells with 10 μm of mepacrine (quinacrine hydrochloride) (6.Savage B.

Note that the fluorescence of erythrocytes is blocked by hemoglobin so that these cells are not visible in the background. Leukocytes, on the other hand, are brightly fluorescent but fail to interact with the surface under the chosen experimental conditions. Reconstituted blood was aspirated through a parallel plate chamber by a syringe pump (Harvard Bioscience) at the flow rate of 0.484 ml/min, producing a wall shear rate of 1500 s−1 at the inlet. The distance between the plates of the chamber was 147 μm and was maintained by a gasket designed to produce variable shear rates along the direction of flow (6.Savage B. Saldivar E. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 38.Usami S. Chen H.H. Zhao Y. Chien S. Skalak R. Ann. Biomed. Eng. 1993; 21: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). All experiments were recorded on standard videotape with a Sony 9500 video cassette recorder. The interaction of selected mutant and wild type A1 domain fragments with the monoclonal antibody NMC-4 was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunoadsorbant assay (ELISA), following a procedure described elsewhere (39.Mohri H. Yoshioka A. Zimmerman T.S. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17361-17367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Berliner S. Niiya K. Roberts J.R. Houghten R.A. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7500-7505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The number of individual platelets interacting with immobilized recombinant vWF fragments was measured on images obtained at selected wall shear rates (6.Savage B. Saldivar E. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Each image corresponded to a single frame from real time (30 frames/s) videotape recordings, digitized and processed by computer analysis using a Matrox Image LC frame grabber and the MetaMorph software package (Universal Imaging Corp.). After 1 min from the beginning of blood flow and over the ensuing 4 min, a stack of 10 images captured randomly from the tape at 2–5-s intervals was created for each of the shear rates tested (340–630 and 1210–1500 s−1). Background fluorescence was defined as the average of 15 images of the surface without platelets in focus and was subtracted from all processed images. After adjusting brightness and contrast, an arbitrary threshold was applied to distinguish platelets from noise, and the images were binarized. Adherent platelets, regardless of the duration of their transient interaction with immobilized vWF A1 domain, were counted on an area of 25,600 μm2. The conformation of the GP Ibα peptide GDTDLY(SO4) DY(SO4)Y(SO4) (residues 271–279 in the mature protein) exhibiting the lowest energy of interaction with the vWF A1 domain is shown in Fig. 1. Interatomic distances between GP Ibα and A1 domain residues allowed the identification of putative interactions and the definition of their nature, according to established parameters (TableI). Residues Asp560, His563, Tyr565, and particularly Glu596 and Lys599 in the A1 domain appeared to play a prominent role in contacting the receptor (Fig.2). This finding highlights the possible participation of strand β3 and preceding loop (residues 559–566) as well as helix α3 (residues 594–603) in mediating platelet adhesion. The main GP Ibα residues involved in forming a complex with the A1 domain were Asp277, Tyr278, and Tyr279, with a notable contribution by the sulfate group of Tyr278 and additional participation of Gly271, Asp272, and Asp274 (Table I and Fig. 2). Of note, the 271–279 GP Ibα peptide containing nonsulfated Tyr residues could also be docked onto the A1 domain with relatively low energy of interaction but not as low as measured with the peptide containing sulfotyrosine (not shown). Moreover, the nonsulfated peptide appeared to interact predominantly with the side chain of Arg629 in the A1 domain (Fig. 2), shown not to be directly required for binding to GP Ibα in functional assays under flow conditions (see below). The buried surface areas in the complex were 418 Å2 for the A1 domain and 353 Å2 for the docked peptide.Table IInteractions between amino acid residues in the vWF A1 domain and the docked GP Ibα peptideA1 domainGP IbαType of interactionAsp560Tyr(SO4)279VDWGly561Tyr278VDWSer562Tyr278H bondSer562Asp277H bondSer562Tyr278VDWHis563Asp277VDWAla564Asp277VDWAla564Asp277H bondAla564Asp274H bondTyr565Asp272H bondTyr565Asp274VDWLys572Gly271H bondIleu580Asp272VDWGlu596Tyr(SO4)278H bondGlu596Tyr278VDWGlu596Tyr(SO4)279H bondLys599Tyr(SO4)278H bondLys599Tyr279H bondLys599Tyr278VDWTyr600Tyr278VDWTyr600Tyr279VDWTyr600Asp277VDWVDW indicates van der Waals interactions and H bond indicates hydrogen bonds, as defined on the basis of interatomic distances between the docked GP Ibα peptide and the vWF A1 domain.

A limited portion of the A1 domain structure is shown, with α-helices inred, β-strands in light green, and connecting loops in purple. This segment begins with a portion of the loop between strands β2 and β3 (G561) and continues with strand β3, helix α2, helix α3, strand β4, helix α4 as well as intervening loops. The vWF A1 domain side chains are colored inblue (residues in strand β3) or purple(residues in helix α4) and numbered according to the sequence of the mature protein (24.Celikel R. Varughese K.I.

All the A1 domain side chains shown in the figure have been mutated to document their functional role in GP Ibα binding (see Fig. 3) or antibody NMC-4 binding (see Fig. 4).

Recombinant vWF fragments comprising residues 445–733 of the mature subunit and containing the A1 domain were expressed with single or multiple mutations of residues selected among those that appeared to be involved in the modeled interaction with GP Ibα (Table I). Additional residues previously shown to be involved in binding to the function blocking antibody NMC-4 (24.Celikel R. Varughese K.I. Madhusudan A. Yoshioka A. Ware J. Ruggeri Z.M. Nat. Struct.

In total, 14 different mutant fragments in addition to the one with native sequence were individually tested after immobilization onto a glass surface for their ability to interact with platelets when exposed to blood cells flowing in a plasma-free suspension at wall shear rates between 340 and 1500 s−1. After coating onto glass, the presence of all fragments on the surface was confirmed by reactivity with specific monoclonal antibodies detected by enzyme-linked immunoassay (42.Clamp J.R. Hughes K.W. McPherson J.C. Immunochemistry. 1971; 8: 871-879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with previous results, the fragment with native sequence supported a characteristic rolling adhesion of platelets as typically mediated by multimeric vWF with similar shear rate dependence (23.Miyata S. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6586-6593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For the purpose of these studies, all platelets in contact with the surface, regardless of velocity of rolling and duration of interaction, were considered as adherent. At shear rates between 1500 and 1210 s−1, 7 of the 14 mutant A1 domain molecules supported platelet adhesion with at least 50% lower efficiency that the native control, and all with the exception of one showed a similar defec"

When PC12 cells were cultured with nerve growth factor (NGF), expression of cdc2 decreased significantly after day 5, while expression of cdk2 decreased gradually after day 7. Cells overexpressing cdc2 or cdk2 were resistant to NGF-induced differentiation and growth suppression, and maintained high cdc2 or cdk2 kinase activity, respectively, during NGF treatment. In contrast, the NGF-treated parental cells showed a marked decline in these kinase activities after day 3. When PC12 cells were treated with specific inhibitors of cdc2/cdk2 (butyrolactone-I, olomoucin), they showed marked neurite extension and up-regulation of microtubule-associated protein 2 expression. In addition, treatment with mixtures of antisense oligonucleotides for cdc2 and cdk2 resulted in down-regulation of both cdc2 and cdk2 kinase activities as well as significant neurite outgrowth and up-regulation of microtubule-associated protein 2 expression. However, neurite outgrowth was not observed in cells treated with either single antisense oligonucleotide, or antisense cdc2 + cdk4 or cdk2 + cdk4 oligonucleotide mixtures. These results suggest that simultaneous down-regulation of cdc2 and cdk2 activity is sufficient and necessary for neuronal differentiation in PC12 cells.

The decision to proliferate or differentiate is made during the G1 phase of the cell cycle by the interaction of G1 cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks)1 and cdk inhibitors (1.Lees E. Faha B.V.

Cyclin-cdk complexes have been shown to play a crucial role in the G1/S transition, thus regulation of their functions is also critical for the commitment to cellular differentiation. Indeed, we have previously demonstrated that ectopic expression of cdk2, but not of cdk4 or any of the cyclins, inhibits NGF-mediated neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells (5.Dobashi Y. Kudoh T.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ectopic expression of D-type cyclins or cdk4 was also reported to inhibit granulocyte-colony stimulating factor-induced differentiation of murine myeloid cells or erythroleukemia cells, respectively (7.Kato J.

In addition, cell differentiation has been reported to correlate with the suppression or activation of kinase activity in several cell lines, including those of the neuronal, hematopoietic, and myocytic lineages (9.Durand B.

Taken together, it is clear that cdks play a key role in the switch between cell proliferation and differentiation, and that the responsible cdk varies with cell type. However, it still remains unclear whether a change in cdk activity directly induces neuronal differentiation or whether this change is secondary to differentiation. We have been investigating the involvement of cell cycle regulator molecules in the neuronal differentiation of rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. PC12 cells are a good model of neuronal differentiation since they are particularly responsive to growth factors, such as nerve growth factor (NGF), basic fibroblast growth factor, and overexpression of oncogene products, v-src (17.Greene L.A.

In the previous study, we showed that suppression of cdk2, but not of cdk4 activity, is a crucial step in the neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells (5.Dobashi Y. Kudoh T. Matsumine A. Toyoshima K.

Thus, in the present study, we investigated more specifically the roles of cdc2 and cdk2 during this process and, herein, demonstrate that suppression of both cdc2 and cdk2 activities induces neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells, independent of the differentiation inducing agents described above. PC12 cells were grown on plastic dishes with collagen coating in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum. For NGF treatment (20 or 50 ng/ml in final concentration) or induction of neuronal differentiation, cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% horse serum and 2.5% fetal bovine serum. Cells having one or more neurites with the length more than twice the diameter of the cell body were defined as “differentiated” (5.Dobashi Y. Kudoh T. Matsumine A. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. J. Biol.

Twenty-four hours later (day 0), the cells were fed with fresh medium. The attached cells were harvested at day 0, 1, 3, and 7 and counted by using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton & Dickinson). Each experiment was performed in triplicate. Reagents in this study were obtained as follows: puromycin was purchased from Sigma, NGF was from Wako Ltd. Butyrolactone-I (BL-I) was purified as described previously (23.Kitagawa M. Okabe T. Ogino H. Matsumoto H. Takahashi I. Kokubo T. Higashi H. Saito S. Taya Y. Yasuda H. Ohba Y. Nishimura S. Tanaka N.

Human cdc2 and cdk2 cDNAs, subcloned into the pcDL-SRα 296 vector were provided by Dr. K. Sagawa, Keio University (25.Takebe Y. Sriki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 283-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and used for transfection into PC12 cells. PC12 cells (5 × 106 cells) were transfected with 50 μg of cDNA(s) along with 5 μg of the puromycin resistance gene pcDNA-puro (Invitrogen). Transfection was achieved by electroporation with a Bio-Rad electroporator followed by selection for puromycin resistance (Life Technologies, Inc., 5 μg/ml). Four weeks after transfection, 50 clones were isolated for each cDNA transfection and maintained in medium containing 3 μg/ml puromycin. For each cDNA transfectant, the 3 clones showing the highest expression were selected by immunoblotting analysis and used for further experiments. Monoclonal antibody against cdc2 and polyclonal antibody against cdk2 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and monoclonal antibody against microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2, clones AP18 and AP20) was obtained from Lab Vision Corp. For immunoblotting analysis, cells were lysed in high-salt lysis buffer as described previously (5.Dobashi Y. Kudoh T. Matsumine A. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23031-23037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of each sample was determined using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad), 50 μg of protein was analyzed on a SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel (12% of acrylamide gel) for cdc2 and cdk2, 100 μg of protein on a gradient gel of 3.5–15% (w/v) for MAP2 (27.Stroth U.

Following blocking in skim milk for 3 h, the membrane was incubated with primary antibodies to human cdc2 (1:400 dilution), cdk2 (1:200), or MAP2 (mixture of AP 18 and AP20, each 1:200). Each protein was detected by sequential binding of a specific primary antibody followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:6000 dilution, Promega). Twenty base sense and antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides complementary to the sequence around the ATG initiation sites of rat cdc2 (28.Lee M.G. Nurse P.

Each sequence was as follows: cdc2 sense, 5′-TTGACTAACTATGGAAGATT-3′; cdc2 antisense, 5′-AATCTTCCATAGTTAGTCAA-3′; cdk2 sense, 5′-CTAGCGCTCCATGGAGAACT-3′; cdk2 antisense, 5′-AGTTCTCCATGGAGCGCTAG-3′; cdk4 sense, 5′-TGCTCCGAGAATGGCTACCA-3′; cdk4 antisense, 5′-TGGTAGCCATTCTCGGAGCA-3′. The cells were incubated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as a control, 30 mm sense or antisense oligonucleotides for 72 h with additions at 0, 24, and 48 h. When mixtures of oligonucleotides were used, 30 mm of each oligonucleotide was used. Morphological change was observed throughout the experimental period, and the cells were harvested for further experiments at the end of the 3rd day. Each experiment was performed in duplicate. In vitro cdc2 kinase assay was performed with MESACUP cdc2 Kinase Assay Kit (MBL). This kit utilizes a synthetic peptide substance and a monoclonal antibody recognizing the phosphorylated form of the cdc2-specific peptide substance (antibody 4A4). In brief, cells were lysed in cdc2 sample buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 m NaCl, 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% Brij 35, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml leupeptin) and the resultant lysates were sonicated on ice four times for 10 s each (31.Dobashi Y.

Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 50 min and aliquots (20 μg of protein) were incubated in a 50-μl reaction solution (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm ATP) containing biotinylated peptide (SLYSSSPGGAYC) for 30 min at 30 °C. After terminating the reaction with 200 μl of phosphorylation stop reagent (50 mm EDTA in PBS), 100 μl of the reaction mixture was transferred to microwells coated with monoclonal antibody, 4A4, and incubated for 60 min at 25 °C. Then, 100 μl of peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin was added to the microwells and the reactions were incubated for 30 min followed by incubation with 100 μl of peroxidase-substrate solution (5.3 mg/mlo-phenylenediamine in H2O2) for 5 min. After terminating the reaction with 20% H3PO4, the absorbance of each well was read at 492 nm with a microplate reader (Bio-Rad). Independent experiments were performed in triplicate. Cells were lysed in solubilizing buffer for cdk2 and in immunoprecipitation buffer for cdk4 as described previously (5.Dobashi Y. Kudoh T. Matsumine A. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. J. Biol.

Lysates (100 μg of protein) were incubated with anti-cdk2 antibody (diluted 1:150) or anti-cdk4 antibody (1:100) for 1 h, followed by an additional 1-h incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C. A bacterially expressed fragment of the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) fused to glutathioneS-transferase was purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose and used as a substrate (0.5 μg of protein) in 50 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 20 mm[γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi; 1 μCi = 37 kBq) (5.Dobashi Y.

After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, the sample was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. Independent experiments were performed in triplicate. Densitometric quantification of the data obtained by immunoblotting analysis (nitrocellulose filters) andin vitro kinase assays (x-ray films) were done using a GT6500ARTS scanner (Epson) and all scans were incorporated into NIH images (version 1.56) for densitometric analysis (33.Dobashi Y. Shoji M. Wakata Y. Kameya T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Since more than one band was detected in the cdc2 and cdk2 immunoblots, the most rapidly migrating bands were subjected to quantification. PC12 cells were cultured in the presence of 5% horse serum, 2.5% fetal bovine serum, and 20 ng/ml NGF for 10 days. At days 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10, cells were lysed and the expression of cdc2 and cdk2 was evaluated by immunoblotting analysis using specific antibodies. Changes in MAP2 expression were also examined to confirm the neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells induced by NGF (27.Stroth U. Meffert S. Gallinat S. Unger T. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 53: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 34.Katsetos C.D. Herman M.M. Balin B.J. Vinores S.A. Hessler R.B. Arking E.J. Karkavelas G. Frankfurter A. Anat. Rec. 1998; 250: 351-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the expression of MAP2 increased gradually, reaching 1.9-fold higher levels through the 10 days of observation. In contrast, the expression of cdc2 decreased significantly after 5 days to 50% of the initial level and decreased gradually thereafter to 12% by day 10. The expression of cdk2 was more or less stable for the first 5 days, then decreased to 60% of the initial level after 7 days, and to 25% after 10 days. Expression constructs containing human cdc2 or cdk2 cDNAs were transfected into PC12 cells, and clonally derived cell lines expressing significantly higher levels of each protein were obtained. Immunoblotting analysis of those cell lines showed that the bands corresponding to ectopically overexpressed cdc2 and cdk2 proteins were almost identical in size to those of the endogenous proteins (Fig.2). The highest levels of the overexpressed cdc2 and cdk2 proteins were, approximately, 6.8- and 6.1-fold higher, respectively, than those of the endogenous proteins. All of the established cell lines overexpressing cdc2, cdk2, or transfected with the empty vector showed morphologies very similar to the parental PC12 cells in the absence of NGF (Fig. 3 a). When the cells were stimulated with NGF (50 ng/ml), approximately 70% of the parental cells and 60% of the vector-transfected cells displayed neurite outgrowths by day 3 (Fig. 3 b). Neurite outgrowths were the most prominent at day 7 in those two cell lines (Fig. 3 c). By contrast, each of the three independent cell lines overexpressing cdc2 or cdk2 did not show any significant neurite extension throughout the 7 days of observation (Fig. 3 c). NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells is accompanied by a decline in the growth rate (17.Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4862) Google Scholar). Thus, the effects of cdc2 or cdk2 overexpression on the growth of PC12 cells were examined by culturing these cell lines in the absence or presence of NGF (50 ng/ml). In the absence of NGF, all of the cell lines exhibited similar growth rates (Fig. 4 a). In the presence of NGF, the parental and vector-transfected cells showed marked growth suppression after 3 days of culture, while cell lines overexpressing cdc2 (clones cdc2–4, -9, and -25) exhibited no NGF-mediated growth suppression and no significant reduction in the growth rate until day 7. The cell lines overexpressing cdk2 (clones cdk2–6, -7, and -14) also did not show any significant decline in the growth rate (Fig.4 b). The experimental results described above suggested that suppression of cdc2 and cdk2 kinase activities could be a crucial factor in neuronal differentiation. We, therefore, examined the changes in cdc2 kinase activity that occurred during NGF-induced differentiation (20 ng/ml NGF). cdc2 kinase activity was assayed by its ability to phosphorylate a cdc2-specific synthetic oligopeptide. As shown in Fig. 5 a, a rapid decline in kinase activity to about 51% of the starting levels was detected in parental cells at day 3, 14% at day 7, and 2.5% at day 10. An almost identical time course was observed in vector-transfected cells (Fig. 5 b). However, in the cell lines overexpressing cdc2 (clones cdc2–4, -9, and -25) which initially showed 1.4-fold higher level, cdc2 kinase activity slightly decreased but was still maintained at 1.2-fold higher levels of the parental cells after 10 days (Fig. 5 c, only the data obtained from one cell line, cdc2–25, is shown). In contrast, in cell lines overexpressing cdk2, cdc2 activities decreased to 54, 16, and 6% of the initial levels at day 3, 7, and day 10, respectively (Fig. 5 d, only the data obtained from one cell line, cdk2–6, is shown). We next examined the changes in cdk2 kinase activity in lysates of these cell lines during NGF-induced differentiation (20 ng/ml NGF). cdk2 immunoprecipitates were assayed for their ability to phosphorylate a fragment of recombinant pRB (5.Dobashi Y. Kudoh T. Matsumine A. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23031-23037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6, a rapid decline in kinase activity to about 7 and 18% of the starting levels was detected in parental cells and a vector-transfected cell line, respectively, at day 3. In cell lines overexpressing cdc2, cdk2 activity decreased to 14 and 0% of the initial levels at days 3 and 7, respectively (Fig. 6; only the data obtained from one cdc2-overexpressing cell line, cdc2–25, is shown). However, cdk2 kinase activity in all of the cell lines overexpressing cdk2 remained high; 1.9-fold of that in the parental cells at the initial level and 1.3-fold at day 10 (Fig. 6). Since our results indicate that overexpression of cdc2 or cdk2 can inhibit PC12 neuronal differentiation, we next examined whether the cdc2/cdk2 inhibitors BL-I or OLM could induce differentiation in these cells. Both of these agents have been previously demonstrated to suppress cdc2/cdk2 activity (23.Kitagawa M. Okabe T. Ogino H. Matsumoto H. Takahashi I. Kokubo T. Higashi H. Saito S. Taya Y. Yasuda H. Ohba Y. Nishimura S. Tanaka N. Okuyama A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2425-2432PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Kitagawa M. Higashi H. Takahashi I. Okabe T. Ogino H. Taya Y. Nishimura S. Okuyama A.

In addition, changes in MAP2 expression were also examined to confirm the neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells by NGF (27.Stroth U. Meffert S. Gallinat S. Unger T. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 53: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 34.Katsetos C.D. Herman M.M. Balin B.J. Vinores S.A. Hessler R.B. Arking E.J. Karkavelas G. Frankfurter A. Anat. Rec. 1998; 250: 351-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A control group, treated with 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide alone did not show significant neurite outgrowth and expression of MAP2 was much lower than in cells treated with NGF (50 ng/ml) for 3 days (Fig.7, a and d). When PC12 cells were cultured in 20–80 μg/ml BL-I, cells displayed prominent neurite extension by 3 days and MAP2 expression was significantly higher than the control group and comparable to cells treated with NGF (Fig. 7, b and d). This effect of BL-I was optimal at a concentration around 50 μg/ml. When cells were treated with more than 80 μg/ml BL-I, neurite extension was unclear, probably due to the cytotoxic effect of the drug. Treatment with OLM at concentrations between 30 and 50 μm also caused neurite extension in PC12 cells (Fig. 7 c). In these cells, MAP2 was much higher than that of control cells, reaching levels almost comparable to the NGF-treated group (Fig. 7 d). OLM at concentrations less than 20 μm did not show any significant effect, while treatment at more than 60 μmcaused shrinkage of the cytoplasm which obscured clear formation of the neurites. To determine whether the induction of neuronal differentiation by BL-I and OLM is the result of the suppression of cdc2 and/or cdk2 activity, PC12 cells were treated with antisense oligonucleotides. As controls, cdk4 sense and antisense oligonucleotides were also tested. When cells were cultured in the presence of any of the sense oligonucleotides or cdk4 antisense oligonucleotides, no neurite extension was observed at day 3 (Fig.8 a). When cultured with cdc2 or cdk2 antisense oligonucleotides, cells generated short processes but no apparent neurites through 3 days of treatment (Fig. 8 a, lower row). Next, cells treated with mixtures of any two sense oligonucleotides or antisense cdc2 and cdk4, or cdk2 and cdk4 oligonucleotides generated occasional short processes but no significant neurite extension (Fig. 8 b). However, treatment with a mixture of cdc2 and cdk2 antisense oligonucleotides, resulted in the marked formation of significant neurite extensions at day 3 (Fig.8 b, lower row). Accordingly, only cells treated with a mixture of cdc2/cdk2 antisense oligonucleotides showed higher expression of MAP2 protein, similar to the control NGF-treated group (Fig. 8 c). The experimental results described above suggested that a reduction in cdc2 and cdk2, but not in cdk4 kinase activities, correlates well with the extent of morphological neuronal differentiation. We therefore examined changes in cdc2 and cdk2 as well as cdk4 kinase activity to confirm that their kinase activities were suppressed by the corresponding oligonucleotides and that the kinase activities of cdc2 and cdk2 correlated with neurite extension induced by antisense oligonucleotides. In extracts from cells treated with sense oligonucleotide alone, cdc2, cdk2, and cdk4 kinase activity declined slightly to about 80% of the control cells treated with PBS (Fig. 9, a-c). In contrast, in extracts from cells treated with cdc2-antisense oligonucleotide alone, cdc2 kinase activity declined to about 8.2% of the control cells treated with PBS, while cdk2 and cdk4 activities were maintained at 84 and 81%, respectively, at day 3 (Fig. 9, a-c). In cells treated with cdk2 antisense oligonucleotide alone, cdk2 activity declined markedly to 6.3% while cdc2 and cdk4 activities were maintained at 79 and 82% of the control level, respectively (Fig. 9,a-c). In cells treated with cdk4 antisense oligonucleotides, cdk4 activity decreased to 11%, while cdc2 and cdk2 activities declined slightly to 85 and 82%, respectively, of the control level (Fig. 9, a-c). These results suggest that each kinase activity was suppressed by the corresponding antisense oligonucleotide without significant cross-inhibition. Cells treated with mixtures of any of the sense oligonucleotides showed a slight decrease in all of kinase activities, to about 80% of the control cells treated with PBS alone (Fig. 9, d-f). However, cells treated with mixtures of cdc2 and cdk2 antisense oligonucleotides showed a marked decrease in both cdc2 and cdk2 activities, to 8.7 and 9.3%, respectively, while cdk4 kinase activity was maintained at 79% of the control levels (Fig.9, d-f). Mixtures of cdc2/cdk4 or cdk2/cdk4 similarly suppressed the activities of corresponding kinases without showing any significant inhibition of the other kinases (Fig. 9,d-f). In the present study, we demonstrated the involvement of cdc2 and cdk2 in the differentiation of PC12 cells by overexpression or inhibition of these two molecules. Our results suggest that, both cdc2 and cdk2 are key regulators of neuronal differentiation in this cell type, as defined by neurite outgrowth and by up-regulation of MAP2 protein expression. We found that the activity of cdc2 and cdk2 decreased significantly following the addition of NGF, while constitutive overexpression of either cdc2 or cdk2 completely inhibited differentiation of PC12 cells. Furthermore, simultaneous suppression of both cdc2/cdk2, but not either alone, induced neuronal differentiation. Cdc/cdk family kinase activity seems to be a critical determinant in switching between cell proliferation and differentiation, although reports describing their roles have varied, probably due to tissue or cell type-specific differences. In hematopoietic cell lineages, cdk4/cdk6 has been shown to be a major determinant in this switching, since forced expression of cdk4 inhibits differentiation in erythroleukemia cells and p16, one of the cdk4 inhibitors, has been reported to promote differentiation in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (8.Kiyokawa H. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7195-7203Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 15.Urashima M. DeCaprio J. Chauhan A.D. Teoh G. Ogata A. Treon S.P. Hoshi Y. Anderson K.C. Blood. 1997; 90: 4106-4115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although as a transformed cell line, PC12 cells may have aberrant cell cycle control mechanisms, suppression of cdk2 activity and sustained activation of the MAP kinase pathway have been described as crucial steps in neuronal differentiation (5.Dobashi Y. Kudoh T. Matsumine A. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23031-23037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 22.Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar, 36.Leppa S. Saffrich R. Ansorge W. Bohmann D.

A. 1997; 94: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The novel findings in this study add further weight to the idea that cdc2 and cdk2 kinase activities are key to the differentiation of PC12 cells. cdc2 and cdk2 probably exert their inhibitory effects on neuronal differentiation by forming complexes with endogenous cyclins (1.Lees E. Faha B.V. Dulic V. Reed S.I. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1874-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 39.Draetta G. Luca F. Westendorf J. Brizuela L. Ruderman J. Beach D. Cell. 1989; 56: 829-838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 40.Xiong Y. Zhang H. Beach D. Cell. 1992; 71: 505-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that it is the levels of cdc2 and cdk2 that are limiting, and not those of the cyclins. Thus, these kinases function in a dose-dependent manner: endogenous levels of cdc2/cdk2 are sufficient to promote cell proliferation and inhibit spontaneous differentiation in the absence of NGF, but not sufficient to inhibit differentiation in the presence of NGF. Suppression of cdc2/cdk2 kinase activity allows cells to spontaneously differentiate even in the absence of NGF. Conversely, overexpression of cdc2/cdk2 renders cells resistant to differentiation even in the presence of NGF, and they continue to proliferate. Although overexpression of either cdc2 or cdk2 is sufficient to inhibit differentiation, suppression of both cdc2 and cdk2 are necessary to induce differentiation. These results imply that the signal cascade determining neuronal differentiation in PC12 cells is negatively regulated by these two redundant kinases. However, cdk4 does not seem to be critically involved in this cascade, as shown by this study and by our previous results which demonstrated that constitutive overexpression of cdk4 did not prevent differentiation of PC12 cells (6.Dobashi Y. Kudoh T. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). As for other cyclins, we have previously demonstrated that overexpression of cyclins A, D1, or E had no effect on inhibiting NGF-mediated differentiation (5.Dobashi Y. Kudoh T. Matsumine A. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23031-23037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The fact that suppression of cdc2 and cdk2, but not cdc2 and cdk4 or cdk2 and cdk4, is critical in this process, is noteworthy, although the reasons for this selectivity is unclear. cdc2 and cdk2 phosphorylate several cellular proteins crucially involved in cell cycle regulation which would otherwise prevent cell cycle transition and possibly induce further differentiation (2.Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2591) Google Scholar, 4.Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4312) Google Scholar). One candidate substrate for these kinases is pRB, which is phosphorylated by cdk2 and cdk4 (4.Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4312) Google Scholar, 41.Kato J. Matsushime H. Hiebert S.W. Ewen M.E. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar) and which in addition, plays a crucial role in early neuronal and hematopoietic development (42.Clarke A.R. Maandag E.R. Roon M. Lugt N.M.T. Valk M. Hooper M.L. Berns A. Riele H. Nature. 1992; 359: 328-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar, 43.Jacks T. Fazeli A. Schmitt E.M. Bronson R.T. Godell M.A. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar, 44.Lee E.Y.H. Chang C.Y. Hu N. Wang Y.C. Lai C.C. Herrup K. Lee W.H. Bradley A. Nature. 1992; 359: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). Thus, NGF-induced down-regulation of cdc2 or cdk2 activity could result in the accumulation of hypophosphorylated pRB. Accordingly, constitutive overexpression of cdc2/cdk2 may block differentiation by driving the phosphorylation of pRB. However, it may be difficult to explain our results solely by inhibition of pRB hyperphosphorylation: treatment of cells with antisense oligonucleotides for cdk2 and/or cdk4, did not cause neurite outgrowth, despite the fact that both kinases phosphorylate pRb (4.Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4312) Google Scholar,41.Kato J. Matsushime H. Hiebert S.W. Ewen M.E. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the fact that only the combination of antisense oligonucleotides for cdc2 and cdk2 induced differentiation may suggest that inhibition of kinases in G1, S and G2/M phases is important for cellular differentiation. Simultaneous inhibition of cdc2 and cdk2 may restrain the cell cycle and keep the cells in a static condition. One important mechanism of cyclin/cdk inactivation in neuronal cells involves inhibition by p21 and p27 (2.Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2591) Google Scholar, 3.Hunter T. Pines J. Cell. 1994; 79: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar). Which cdk inhibitor is responsible depends on the cell type; p21 predominates in PC12 cells (45.Gollapudi L. Neet K.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 461-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), but p27 predominates in oligodendrocyte (9.Durand B. Gao F.B. Raff M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 13.Tang X.M. Strocchi P. Cambi F. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 68: 128-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and immortalized hippocampal cells (10.Xiong W. Pestell R. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6585-6597Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These differences may be partially explained by the fact that p21 and p27 sometimes show reciprocal expression and also function in a redundant manner. For example, in certain kinds of human malignant tumors and in p21-deficient mice or p15-deficient human melanoma cells, only p21 or p27 are expressed and one compensates for the other to inhibit cdk (46.Deng C. Zhang P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Cell. 1994; 82: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1948) Google Scholar, 47.Florenes V.A. Bhattacharya N. Bani M.R. Ben-David Y. Kerbel R.S.

Pathol. 1999; 154: 909-918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although induction of differentiation by transfection of a cdk inhibitor alone has not been observed, induction of p21 was reported to enhance susceptibility of PC12 cells for NGF-induced differentiation (5.Dobashi Y. Kudoh T. Matsumine A. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23031-23037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 11.Erhardt J.A. Pittman R.N. J. Biol.

Probably, stable cell lines in which p21 was inducibly overexpressed, may not be able to cause sufficient suppression of cdc2/cdk2 activity to trigger spontaneous differentiation. Again, there may be a dose-dependent effect of cdc/cdk2 suppression by inhibitor: sufficient suppression of cdc2/cdk2 activity triggers spontaneous differentiation even in the absence of NGF, and insufficient inactivation of cdk(s) only commits neuronal cells to a sensitive state for differentiation. Another cdk inhibitor, the INK4 family, have rarely been reported to be involved, consistent with the fact that their target protein, cdk4, is not crucially involved in induction of neuronal differentiation as described previously (2.Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2591) Google Scholar, 3.Hunter T. Pines J. Cell. 1994; 79: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar, 6.Dobashi Y.

Richter K.H. Walker C. Beach D. Sherr C.J. Serrano M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 635-645PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, a recent report has shown that activation of cdk5 induced neurites outgrowth in hippocampal cell lines, indicating that cdk5 activation is a key factor in the differentiation of several kinds of neuronal cells (10.Xiong W. Pestell R. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6585-6597Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Since PC12 cells are transformed cells, and may have aberrant cell cycle properties, this model does not necessarily reflect the general nature of neuronal cells. We also cannot exclude the possibility that cdk5 is also involved in the differentiation of PC12 cells, since some of the inhibitors of cdc2/cdk2 kinase activity also affect this kinase (50.Lee M.H. Nikolic M. Baptista C.A. Lai E. Tsai L.H. Massague J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3259-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 51.Patrick G.N. Zhou P. Kwon Y.T. Howley P.M. Tsai L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24057-24064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). However, taken together, our results strongly suggest that cdc2/cdk2 play a key role in the differentiation of PC12 cells: differentiation is inhibited when these kinases are overexpressed, and differentiation is induced when these kinases are inhibited by antisense oligonucleotides or chemical reagents. We think the next step in understanding the mechanism of neuronal differentiation in PC12 cells will require the identification of those cdc2/cdk2 substrates whose phosphorylation directly affects cell proliferation/differentiation.

https://openalex.org/W2078740172,"By differential display we demonstrated that antibody-mediated ligation of the GPI-linked protein product of E48, a newly discovered human Ly-6 gene, up-regulates the expression of the FX enzyme in 3 lines of head and neck squamous carcinoma cells. FX is responsible for the last step in the synthesis of GDP-l-fucose. The up-regulation of FX was E48 ligand-specific. 22AWT head and neck squamous carcinoma cells expressing high levels of E48 expressed significantly higher levels of FX than the E48 antisense transfected 22AWT cells (8-3 cells). The former cells also expressed higher levels of two major fucosylated glycans (the selectin ligand, Sialyl Lewis a, and VIM-2) than the E48 antisense transfectants. Conversely, transfection of cells from the 14CWT line expressing very low levels of E48 with E48 cDNA caused an up-regulated expression of FX and of the two fucosylated glycans in the 14C-CMV16 transfectants. Moreover, the expression levels of Sialyl Lewis a was significantly up-regulated on HNSCC upon ligation of E48 by anti-E48 antibodies. The functional significance of the E48-mediated up-regulation of Sialyl Lewis a was demonstrated in rolling experiments on E-selectin bearing surfaces under physiological conditions of shear flow and on tumor necrosis factor α-activated human umbilical venous endothelial cells. Only high E48/FX/Sialyl Lewis a expressing 14C-CMV16 cells could roll on purified E-selectin or establish E-selectin dependent rolling on the activated human umbilical venous endothelial cells. Low E48/FX/Sialyl Lewis a expressing 14CWT cells did not roll. These results show that E48 controls the expression of the FX enzyme and of certain fucosylated E-selectin ligands by HNSCC. E48 may thus function as a key regulator of the adhesiveness of these tumor cells to inflamed vessel walls expressing E-selectin.

Balm A.J.M. Van Dongen G.A.M.S. Brakkee J.G.P. Scheper R.J. Snow G.B. Meijer Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 136: 191-197PubMed Google Scholar). The mAb E48 recognizes an outer membrane antigen that was expressed by the majority of HNSCC. The biodistribution of the E48 mAb in HNSCC patients as well as preclinical anti-E48-based therapy experiments showed that radioimmunotherapy using this antibody as a targeting vehicle was a feasible approach for the eradication of small tumor deposits (2.De Bree R. Roos J.C. Quak J.J. Den Hollander W. Wilhelm A.J. Van Lingen A. Snow G.B. Van Dongen G.A.M.S. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 277-286PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Gerretsen M. Visser G.W.M. Brakenhoff R.H.

In view of its potential importance, the mAb E48 defined antigen was characterized by cDNA cloning (4.Brakenhoff R.H. Gerretsen M. Knippels P.M.C. Van Dijk M. Van Essen H. Olde Weghuis D. Sinke R.J. Snow G.B. Van Dongen G.A.M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1677-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It proved to be a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane protein expressed by squamous cells. E48 is highly (nearly 70%) homologous to the murine ThB protein, a member of the Ly-6 gene family (4.Brakenhoff R.H. Gerretsen M. Knippels P.M.C. Van Dijk M. Van Essen H. Olde Weghuis D. Sinke R.J.

E48 maps to human chromosome 8q24 (4.Brakenhoff R.H. Gerretsen M. Knippels P.M.C. Van Dijk M. Van Essen H. Olde Weghuis D. Sinke R.J. Snow G.B. Van Dongen G.A.M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1677-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), which is the syntenic locus of mouse chromosome 15E, the locus of the mouse Ly-6 gene family (6.Shevach E.M. Korty P.E. Immunol. Today. 1989; 10: 195-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Whereas both E48 and ThB are expressed on keratinocytes of squamous epithelia (4.Brakenhoff R.H. Gerretsen M. Knippels P.M.C. Van Dijk M. Van Essen H. Olde Weghuis D. Sinke R.J. Snow G.B. Van Dongen G.A.M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1677-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), they differ in lymphocyte expression. ThB is expressed by mouse lymphocytes, whereas human lymphocytes do not express E48. It was recently found that in contrast to other mouse and human Ly-6 genes that consist of 4 exons, E48 consists of only 3 exons and that sequences at the 5′ end of the transcription start site promote expression by squamous cells. It was suggested that this observation might explain in part the switch from lymphocyte/keratinocyte expression in the mouse to keratinocyte expression in humans (7.Brakenhoff R.M. Van Dijk M. Rood-Knippels E.M. Snow G.B. Immunology. 1997; 159: 4879-4886Google Scholar). The function of E48 on keratinocytes of squamous epithelia is still unclear, although it was suggested that it might be involved in cellular adhesion (4.Brakenhoff R.H. Gerretsen M. Knippels P.M.C. Van Dijk M. Van Essen H. Olde Weghuis D. Sinke R.J. Snow G.B. Van Dongen G.A.M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1677-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Shortly after the cloning of the cDNA encoding the E48 antigen, two additional human Ly-6 genes were cloned (8.Mao M., Yu, M. Tong J.-H. Ye J. Zhu J. Huang Q.-H. Fu G., Yu, L. Zhao S.-Y. Waxman S.

Several proteins such as Thy-1, Ly-6, and CD59, anchored to the membrane by GPI, are capable of signal transduction although they lack transmembrane domains (5.Gumley T.P. McKenzie I.F. Sandrin H.S. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 277-296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is unknown whether E48 is involved in signal transduction pathways. The objective of this study was to find out whether signaling through E48 is capable of altering the expression of cellular genes in HNSCC. To approach this question we treated HNSCC with monoclonal antibodies against E48 in lieu of an as yet unidentified E48 ligand. This study reports that the FX protein (10.De Flora A. Morelli A. Frascio M. Corte G. Curti B. Galliano M. Gozzer C. Minchiotti L. Mareni C. Gaetani G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 500: 109-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), a key enzyme in fucose biosynthesis (11.Tonetti M. Sturla L. Bisso A. Benatti U. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27274-27279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) was up-regulated in HNSCC treated with antibodies against E48. Furthermore, E48 ligation by anti-E48 antibodies on HNSCC also up-regulated expression levels of the selectin ligand sialyl Lewis a (SLea). The HNSCC lines UM-SCC-22A, UM-SCC-22B, and UM-SCC-14C (12.Krause C. Carey T. Ott R. Hurbis C. McClatchey K. Regezi J. Arch. Otolaryngol. 1981; 107: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. T. E. Carey (Ann Arbor, MI) (12.Krause C. Carey T. Ott R. Hurbis C. McClatchey K. Regezi J. Arch. Otolaryngol. 1981; 107: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Below are the designations and the descriptions of the cells utilized in this study; Fig.1 shows the E48 expression profile of these cells: 1) 22AWT cells are the original UM-SCC-22A cells. These cells express E48. 2) 8-3 cells were obtained by a stable transfection of 22AWT cells with E48 antisense. These cells have a significantly lower E48 expression than the parental 22AWT cells. 3) 22A-E48hi cells were obtained by flow cytometry sorting of 22AWT cells for a high E48 expression. These cells express significantly higher levels of E48 than the parental 22AWT cells. 4) 14CWT cells are the original UM-SCC-14C cells. These cells express very little E48. 5) 14C-CMV16 cells were obtained by a stable transfection of 14CWT cells with E48 cDNA. These cells express high levels of E48. 6) 22BWT cells are the original UM-SCC-22B cells. These cells express E48. 7) 22B-E48hi cells were obtained by flow cytometry sorting of 22BWT cells for a high E48 expression. These cells express significantly higher levels of E48 than the parental 22BWT cells. Cells were routinely cultured in humidified air with 5% CO2 at 37 °C in DMEM (Biological Industries, Beit-Ha'Emek, Israel), 5% FCS (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 2 mm l-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Biological Industries, Beit-Ha'Emek, Israel). Human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were isolated from umbilical cord veins according to the method of Jaffe et al.(13.Yaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (6008) Google Scholar). The cells were pooled and established as primary cultures in M199 containing 10% FCS, 8% pooled human serum, 50 μg/ml endothelial cell growth factor (Sigma Israel Chemicals Ltd., Rehovot, Israel), porcine intestinal heparin (10 units/ml) (Sigma Israel Chemicals Ltd.) and antibiotics. Primary cultures were serially passaged (1:3 split ratio), and passages 3 and 4 were taken for adhesion experiments. The mouse mAb against E48 (αE48) has been described previously (1.Quak J.J. Balm A.J.M. Van Dongen G.A.M.S. Brakkee J.G.P. Scheper R.J. Snow G.B. Meijer Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 136: 191-197PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse mAb against human VIM-2 (αVIM-2) (14.Kniep B. Peter-Katalinic J,. Muthing O. Pickl W.F. Knapp W. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 456-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) was kindly supplied by Dr. V. Knapp (Institute of Immunology, Vienna University, Austria). Mouse mAb against human NCA (αNCA) was kindly supplied by Dr. D. Goldenberg and Dr. H. Hansen, Immunomedics, Inc. This antibody is also cross-reactive with the GPI linked 50/90 antigen, which is expressed on activated granulocyte (16.Hansen H.J. Goldenberg D.M. Newman E.S. Grebenau R. Sharkey R.M. Cancer. 1993; 71: 3478-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Mouse mAb against human SLea (αSLea, clone 2D3) has been described previously (15.Takada A,. Ohmori K. Takahashi N. Tsuyuoka K,. Yago A. Zenita K. Hasegawa A. Kannagi R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Mouse mAbs against human SLex(αSLex, clone Km-93), human CD59 (clone YTH53.1), and ICAM-1 (clone 84H10) and against human CD62E (E-selectin, clone 1.2B6) were purchased from Serotech (Oxford, UK). A rabbit antibody against human actin was purchased from Sigma. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies directed against FX were generated in our laboratory, using two peptides from the native human FX protein (11.Tonetti M. Sturla L. Bisso A. Benatti U. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27274-27279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar): 1) H2N-CNGPPMNSNFGYS (amino acids 133–144) and 2) H2N-CASNSKLRTYLPDFRF (amino acids 284–298). The E48 encoding cDNA in pCDM8 (4.Brakenhoff R.H. Gerretsen M. Knippels P.M.C. Van Dijk M. Van Essen H. Olde Weghuis D. Sinke R.J. Snow G.B. Van Dongen G.A.M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1677-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) was inverted to antisense orientation by EcoRI cleavage and religation. The isolated inserts of the sense and antisense cDNAs were excised byHindIII/NotI digestion and inserted in theHindIII/NotI sites of pRC-CMV (Invitrogen, Leek, The Netherlands). The cell lines were transfected by Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). In short, cells were plated in a 6-well plate (2 × 105 cells/well) and cultured overnight. A mixture of Lipofectin and DNA was prepared: 10 μg/ml Lipofectin and 10 μg of DNA for UM-SCC-14C cells or 50 μg/ml Lipofectin and 10 μg DNA for UM-SCC-22A cells. The Lipofectin and DNA were mixed in a small volume of serum-free DMEM (20% of the final transfection volume) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The solution was adjusted to the final volume with serum-free DMEM. The cultured cells were washed twice with serum-free medium before the addition of the transfection solution (0.75 ml/well). After 24 h of incubation, the transfection solution was replaced by regular tissue culture medium. After an incubation period of 72 h, selection medium was added containing 1 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Surviving clones were tested for E48 expression by immunocytochemical staining. From transfectants with a heterogenous expression or a down-regulated expression of E48, clones with a homogeneous E48 expression were obtained by limiting dilution. 3 × 106 cells were incubated for 60 min at 4 °C with anti-E48 mAb. Following two washes with DMEM supplemented with 5% FCS, the cells were incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary mouse antibody against human IgG. After two more washes, cellular populations expressing high levels of E48 (22A-E48hi or 22B-E48hi) were obtained by using a FACS-IV sorter (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Several cycles of sorting were required to obtain cells with a significantly higher E48 expression than the parental cells. E48-mediated signals were transduced to HNSCC by incubating cells with anti-αE48 mAb for 1 h at 37 °C. Control cells were incubated under the same conditions without antibody. The cells were subsequently washed, and RNA was isolated (17.Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4695) Google Scholar). Differentially expressed genes were determined by differential display polymerase chain reaction (17.Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4695) Google Scholar) using the DeltaTM RNA Fingerprinting kit (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.). The following primers were used: 5′-CATTATGCTGAGTGATATCTCTTTTTTTTTGC-3′ and 5′-ATTAACCCTCACTAAATGGAGCTGG-3′. Differentially expressed cDNA bands in antibody-stimulated cells as compared with control cells were eluted from the gel and reamplified by polymerase chain reaction using the same primers according to the manufacturer's instructions. A higher expression of mRNA corresponding to the cDNA identified in the above assays was confirmed by using Northern blotting of RNA from untreated or from anti-E48 mAb-treated cells. Differentially expressed cDNA bands were isolated from the sequencing gel, radiolabeled, and used as a probe in RNA blot analysis. The corresponding cDNA fragment that generated a specific hybridization pattern on RNA blots was sequenced in both directions, and the nucleotide sequence obtained was compared with known sequences by searching the GenBankTM with the FASTA program (Genetic Computer Group software (Madison, WI). Total RNA was isolated from antibody-treated or control cells using RNAzol solution (Bio Labs, Jerusalem, Israel). A total of 20 μg of RNA was loaded on an 1% agarose formaldehyde gel and electrophoresed in MOPS buffer as described by Sambrook et al. (18.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The RNA was subjected to Northern blotting by capillary transfer in 20× SSC onto hybond N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and hybridized as described below. The level of FX expression was quantified by densitometry and is presented as the ratio between the signal of FX mRNA in each cell (untreated or treated with anti-E48 antibodies), and the signal of rRNA in the same cell was exposed to the same treatment as above. Differentially expressed cDNA bands were excised from the differential display sequencing gel and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) (HybondTM-N; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), by multiprime elongation (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and hybridized overnight at 42 °C to filters. The filters were washed once in 2× SSC/0.1% SDS at room temperature for 30 min followed by two washes in 0.1% SSC/0.1% SDS for 30 min each at 50 °C and autoradiographed for 1–3 days. 1 × 106 cells were incubated for 60 min at 4 °C with the different mAbs (diluted 1:80 to 1:100). Following two washes with DMEM supplemented with 5% FCS and 0.05% sodium azide, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG Fab′ (Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab. Inc., West Grove, PA). Following two more washes, the pattern of antigen expression was determined using a Becton Dickinson FACSort (Mountain View, CA) and the CellQuest software. Mean Fluorescence was determined for antigen-positive cells only. 2 × 106 22AWT or 8-3 cells were seeded in 25-cm culture flasks in 5 ml of DMEM supplemented with 5% FCS. After 24 h the medium was replaced with 2 ml of fresh medium with or without 50 μg/ml monoclonal antibody against E48 or NCA for 2,4,6 or 8 h. At the end of incubation, the cells were removed from the bottom of the flask, and SLea expression was determined by flow cytometry using as first antibody a 1:10 diluted biotin-conjugated IgM mouse antibody directed against human SLea (clone 2D3) (Seikagaku Co., Tokyo, Japan) and as secondary Ig antibody Phycoerythrin-conjugated Streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab. Inc., West Grove, PA). Student's t test was used to evaluate the statistical significance of differences between FX and SLea expression on HNSCC before and after treating the cells with anti-E48 or anti-NCA antibodies. HNSCC monolayers were cultured in to confluence and lysed on their culture dishes with Laemmli sample buffer (19.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207084) Google Scholar). Lysates were boiled for 10 min, centrifuged, and applied on a miniprotean II system (Bio-Rad) for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 12% slab gel as described by Laemmli (19.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207084) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic transfer of proteins from the polyacrylamide gel to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schull) was performed by a mini-transblot electrophoretic cell (Bio-Rad) at 100 V for 1.5 h. After transfer, the nitrocellulose membrane was cut into strips and incubated at room temp. with 5% milk in TBS-Tween for 30 min to block free binding sites on the membrane. The blocked nitrocellulose membrane strips were incubated overnight with anti-FX polyclonal antibodies raised in our laboratory, diluted 1:2000, then washed three times for 10 min with Tween-20 buffer, and incubated for 45 min with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary goat antibody against rabbit IgG at room temp. Finally, the nitrocellulose strips were washed three times for 10 min with TBS-Tween. The bands were visualized by chemoluminescence-ECL reaction and autoradiography by exposure to Kodak X-AR5 film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY) for 1–8 min. The quantification of protein in the lanes was determined by Western blotting the membrane also with anti-actin antibodies diluted 1:2000. The level of FX expression is presented as the ratio between the FX protein signal (determined by densitometry) for each cell type and the actin signal in the same cell type. Cultured H1 cells grown as monolayers were harvested by a 10-min incubation with H/H medium (Hanks' balanced salt solution (Sigma Israel Chemicals Ltd.), containing bovine serum albumin (2 mg/ml, fraction V, Sigma) and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), supplemented with 5 mm EDTA at 37 °C. Washed cells were resuspended in the same medium at a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml and kept at room temperature until use. Cells were diluted 20-fold into binding medium (H/H supplemented with 2 mm Ca2+) and immediately perfused through the flow chamber. An E-selectin coated substrate was prepared as described (20.Fuhlbrigge R.C. Alon R. Puri K.D. Lowe J.B. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein A (20 μg/ml in coating medium; Sigma) was spotted onto a polystyrene plate, the substrate was blocked with 2% human serum albumin (Fraction V; Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) in phosphate-buffered saline and overlaid with culture supernatant from COS cells transfected with cDNA of human E-selectin-IgG1 (a kind gift of Dr. T. S. Kupper, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA). For control, a protein A spot was overlaid with culture supernatant from untransfected COS cells. The E-selectin coated plate or the protein-A control plate were assembled in a parallel flow chamber (260-μm gap thickness) (21.Lawrence M.B. Springer T.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 859-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar) and mounted on the stage of an inverted phase-contrast microscope (Diaphot-TMD, Nikon Inc., Garden City, NY). For adhesion experiments on resting or activated EC, primary HUVEC (passage 2 or 3) were plated at confluent density for 1 h on tissue culture dishes (Becton Dickinson, Falcon Plates, Plymouth, UK) spotted with human fibronectin (25 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline). Nonadherent EC was gently rinsed out, and adherent cells were grown on the fibronectin-coated spots for 24 h before cytokine treatment. The EC monolayers were left intact or stimulated for 18 h with heparin-free culture medium supplemented with TNFα (2 ng/ml, 50 units/ml) (R & D, Minneapolis, MN). Before assay, the various EC-coated plates were washed three times with binding medium and assembled as the lower wall of the flow chamber, where a portion of the monolayer (5 × 30 mm) was exposed to flow. 5 × 105/ml cells suspended in binding medium were perfused in the flow chamber with a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Natick, MA) attached to the outlet side. Cells were visualized with a 10× objective and videotaped with a long integration LIS-700 CCD video camera (Applitech, Holon, Israel) and a Time Lapse SVHS-Video recorder (AG-6730, Panasonic, Japan). The number of cells that accumulated in two representative fields (each 0.17 mm2 in area) during 1 min of constant flow generating a wall shear stress of 1 dyn/cm2 was manually quantitated by analysis of played back images directly from a monitor screen. For inhibition studies, substrates were washed with H/H medium supplemented with 5 mm EDTA. The cells were then suspended in the same medium and perfused through the chamber in a wall shear stress of 1 dyn/cm2. Rolling velocities were measured for cells accumulated on the E-selectin substrate during 1 min of flow at 1 dyn/cm2. Rolling of cells accumulated at low flow and then subjected to elevated shear stresses of 5, 10, and 15 dyn/cm2; each shear increment lasting for 10 s was determined thereafter. To find out whether E48 is capable of altering the expression of cellular genes in HNSCC by transducing signals to such cells, αE48 mAb (1.Quak J.J. Balm A.J.M. Van Dongen G.A.M.S. Brakkee J.G.P. Scheper R.J. Snow G.B. Meijer Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 136: 191-197PubMed Google Scholar) was added to 22AWT cells as a surrogate ligand (the physiological ligand of E48 has not been identified thus far). The method used to detect altered gene expression was differential display polymerase chain reaction of mRNA (17.Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4695) Google Scholar). 22AWT cells treated with αE48 mAb for 60 min at 37 °C were used in the differential display assay. 22AWT cells incubated under the same conditions but without antibody served as controls. The density of several cDNA bands was increased in antibody-stimulated cells. Multiple repetitive experiments yielded the same results. One of these cDNA bands was then eluted from the gel and amplified. A higher expression of a mRNA species corresponding to the cDNA species identified in the above assays was confirmed using Northern blotting of RNA from untreated or αE48 mAb-treated 22AWT cells. The corresponding cDNA was then cloned and sequenced. GenBankTM analysis showed that this cDNA species had a 98.2% homology to FX (Ref. 22.Tonetti M. Sturla L. Bisso A. Benatti U. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27274-27279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar; accession number U58766). Fig. 2 shows that compared with control cells FX mRNA is up-regulated in 22AWT cells by αE48 mAb ligation. Similar results were obtained with 22AWT cells incubated with αE48 mAb conjugated to polystyrene 6-μm microparticles (Polysciences Inc., Huntsville, AL). An exposure of cells to E48 mAb-conjugated beads for 30 min yielded a maximal up-regulation of FX (results not shown). Eight different ligation experiments with 22AWT cells were performed. A different RNA preparation was analyzed in each experiment. The average increase in FX mRNA expression in E48 ligated cells compared with control cells was 1.7 ± 0.06-fold (p < 0.005) (Fig. 2). To confirm these data we performed three ligation experiments with E48 antisense-transfected 8-3 cells. These cells expressed significantly lower levels of E48 than the parental 22AWT cells (Fig.1). A different RNA preparation was used in each experiment. The average increase in FX mRNA in E48-ligated 8-3 cells as compared with nonligated 8-3 cells was 2.5 ± 0.09-fold (p< 0.005) (Fig. 2). Cells from a third HNSCC line (22BWT) were also utilized. An increase in FX mRNA expression following E48 ligation was also demonstrated using these cells. Three different experiments using 22BWT cells were performed. A different RNA preparation was used in each experiment. The average increase in FX mRNA expression in E48-ligated 22BWT cells as compared with nonligated 22BWT cells was 1.4 ± 0.005-fold (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2). The up-regulation of FX in 22AWT cells by E48 ligation was also demonstrated at the protein level. Western blotting of lysates from cells treated with αE48 mAb for 60, 120, and 180 min as well as from control cells showed an increased expression of FX protein in antibody-treated cells. Two independent experiments using different lysates in each were performed. 2 h of incubation yielded a maximal up-regulation of FX (6-fold over untreated cells) (Fig.3). These results showed that ligation of E48 in three lines of HNSCC caused an up-regulation of FX mRNA and FX protein. Comparing the results in Figs. 1 and 2, it can be seen that the up-regulation of the expression of FX by E48 ligation was inversely correlated with membrane E48 expression. E48 ligation-mediated FX up-regulation (relative to basic line levels) was higher in low E48-expressing cells than in high expressors. The mechanism of signal transduction by GPI-anchored proteins is still largely unknown because these molecules lack transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions. The next set of experiments was performed to find out whether FX up-regulation in HNSCC is specific to E48-mediated signaling or whether the ligation of other GPI-linked proteins would also up-regulate FX. It was first established that two GPI-linked proteins, CD59 (26.Sugita Y. Masuho Y. Immunotechnology. 1995; 3: 157-168Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and NCA (16.Hansen H.J. Goldenberg D.M. Newman E.S. Grebenau R. Sharkey R.M. Cancer. 1993; 71: 3478-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), are expressed by the HNSCC lines used in this study. Exposure of 22AWT cells to mAb directed against CD59 and NCA, did not result in FX mRNA up-regulation, whereas the same cells exposed to αE48 mAb under identical conditions yielded the expected FX u"

We found that vascular smooth muscle cells require unidentified plasma components besides adhesion molecules to spread in fibrin gel, a likely provisional matrix at wound sites. By purification, the plasma components were found to be α1-proteinase inhibitor, α1-antichymotrypsin, and α2-macroglobulin. The chemically inactivated α1-proteinase inhibitor and α2-macroglobulin lose the spreading activity, indicating that these proteins function as proteinase inhibitors but not as adhesion molecules. Not only anti-integrin (αvβ3 and α5β1) antibodies but also anti-fibronectin antibodies inhibit the cell spreading. The spreading occurs without the addition of fibronectin and integrins, suggesting that cells produce these molecules. In the absence of the proteinase inhibitors, Western blot analysis shows that the fibronectin is degraded in fibrin gel, while it is intact in the presence of the inhibitors. Thus, the proteinase inhibitors prevent adhesion molecules such as fibronectin from being degraded by a cell-derived proteinase(s) and thus play a role in cell spreading.

In most of the studies, however, spreading has been conducted on artificial two-dimensional surfaces rather than in three-dimensional matrices. Cell spreading relates to the cells' ability to migrate, proliferate (1.O'Neill C. Jordan P. Ireland G. Cell. 1986; 44: 489-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and resist apoptosis (2.Re F. Zanetti A. Sironi M. Polentarutti N. Lanfrancone L. Dejana E. Colotta F. J.

While fibrin is known as a blood coagulant protein, it has also been implicated in several forms of tissue response to injuries including angiogenesis (3.Dvorak H.F. Brown L.F. Detmar M. Dvorak A.M.

During in vitro experiments, we unexpectedly found that human smooth muscle cells do not spread in fibrin gel unless serum or plasma was added. Vitronectin, which is identified as the serum-spreading factor (9.Preissner K.T. Blut. 1989; 59: 419-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 10.Tomasini B.R. Mosher D.F. Prog. Hemostasis Thromb. 1991; 10: 269-305PubMed Google Scholar), surprisingly did not promote the spreading. We then tested other molecules such as fibronectin, osteopontin, thrombospondin, platelet-derived growth factor, and plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1)1 as possible spreading factors. However, none of these factors were able to promote the cell spreading. We then attempted to purify the cell spreading factor(s) from bovine plasma and found that these are serine proteinase inhibitors. Cultured human vascular smooth muscle cells (HNB18E6E7) were originally derived from the aorta of a newborn infant (2 days old) autopsy (11.Liaw L. Skinner M.P. Raines E.W. Ross R. Cheresh D.A.

The remaining trypsin was inactivated by an excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). After washing with 20 mmphosphate, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl, the cells were resuspended at 62,500 cells/49 μl in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 25 mmHEPES, pH 7.4. The cell suspensions (49 μl) were mixed with 5 μl of test samples and placed in 96-well culture plates (Falcon). After the addition of 28 μl of recombinant fibrinogen (0.25 mg/ml) (13.Gourkun O.V. Veklich Y.I. Weisel J.W. Lord S.T. Blood. 1997; 89: 4407-4414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Rooney M.M. Parise L.V. Lord S.T. J. Biol.

Gels formed in a few minutes. The cells spread similarly in fibrin gel regardless of the source of fibrinogen, either recombinant or plasma-derived fibrinogen (Sigma or Calbiochem). The plates were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. After 24 h, numbers of spread cells and round cells were counted in three horizontal sections under a phase-contrast microscope. The percentage of cell spreading is defined as the number of spread cells/total cells. Staining of actin with phalloidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma) was performed according to Koyama et al. (15.Koyama H. Raines E.W. Bornfeldt K.E. Roberts J.M. Ross R. Cell. 1996; 87: 1069-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Anti-human αvβ3 integrin antibody (LM609) was purchased from Chemicon. Anti-human β1 integrin antibody (P4C10) was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. and purified using a protein-G column (Life Technologies, Inc.). Anti-fibronectin rabbit serum (R790) was a kind gift from Dr. William G. Carter (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Institute, Seattle, WA). The cell suspension was preincubated for 30 min with both anti-integrin antibodies at 25 μg/ml, anti-fibronectin antibody at 100 μg/ml, or nonimmune mouse IgG at 50 μg/ml. Fibrin gels were made as described above, and cell culture was conducted in the presence of α1PI (2.5 mg/ml), α1ACT (2.5 mg/ml), α2M (2.5 mg/ml) or calf serum (5%). The cell spreading assay was performed as noted above. Fibronectin (Calbiochem) or vitronectin (Calbiochem) was mixed with the cell suspension at 16 μg/ml (equal to 20% of their concentrations in normal serum), and fibrin gels were made as described above. Human recombinant osteopontin was kindly provided by Dr. Cecilia M. Giachelli (University of Washington, Seattle, WA) (16.Smith L.L. Cheung H.K. Ling L.E. Chen J. Sheppard D. Pytela R. Giachelli C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28485-28491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and used at a concentration of 150 nm. Fifty milliliters of fresh frozen bovine plasma (Pel-Freez) was fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation at 30–40% and 60–70% saturation. The precipitates of the 60–70% fraction were suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and ammonium sulfate was added to 0.5 m by monitoring the conductivity. The sample was applied to phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (1.5 × 8.5 cm) that was equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 m ammonium sulfate. The cell spreading activity was recovered in nonadsorbed fraction, which was dialyzed against 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0. The dialyzed sample was then applied to SP-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (1.5 × 6 cm) that was equilibrated with the dialysis buffer. The activity was found in nonadsorbed fraction. After dialysis against 50 mm HEPES-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, the sample was applied to Protein-Pak DEAE (Waters) column (1 × 10 cm) connected to the Waters Advanced Protein Purification System and eluted by salt gradient (0–0.6 m NaCl). The fraction of the first peak was pooled, and ammonium sulfate was added to 1.8 m. The sample was applied to the second phenyl-Sepharose column (0.8 × 2 cm) that was equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1.8 m ammonium sulfate. Proteins were eluted by reversed ammonium sulfate gradient (1.8–0 m). The fractions at the descending edge of the major peak that contained the highest activity were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 m NaCl. The sample was applied to chelating Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (0.8 × 1 cm) that was charged with NiSO4 and equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 m NaCl. After the column was washed with the buffer untilA 280 reached 0.005, proteins were eluted stepwise by 10 column volumes of 5, 40, and 400 mmimidazole in 20 mm Tris/imidazole buffer, pH 8.0. The activity was eluted in the 5 mm imidazole fraction. The ammonium sulfate precipitates were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and applied to DE-52 (Whatman) column (1.7 × 20 cm). The proteins were eluted as a broad peak by NaCl gradient (0–0.5m), and the activity was found in the early and late fractions. The early fractions that had higher activity were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0. The sample was applied to CM-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (1.5 × 8 cm) using 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 6.0. The activity was eluted in the nonadsorbed fraction, which was concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation and applied to Superose-6 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gel filtration column (1 × 30 cm) using 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Two peaks were emerged from the column and the majority of the activity was found in the first peak and pooled. The pooled sample was precipitated by ammonium sulfate at 50% saturation, and the precipitates were dissolved in a small volume of buffer and applied to Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (1 × 42 cm) to remove trace contaminants using 50 mmTris, pH 8.0. Purified rabbit anti-human α1PI antibody was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Goat anti-human α2M serum (Chemicon) was purified using protein A-Sepharose column (Bio-Rad). Normal human serum (2 μl) was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-α1PI (400 μl), anti-α2M (60 μl), or both (460 μl). The concentrations of these antibodies are 10 times higher than the amounts necessary to neutralize α1PI and α2M present in the samples. Pansorbin (Calbiochem) (538 μl) was then mixed with the samples and incubated for another 1 h. The complex of antigens-antibodies-Pansorbin was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatants were used for the cell spreading assay. Because the final sample volume was 1 ml, the human serum was diluted 500 times through the immunoprecipitation. For α1PI, 50 μl of 0.005% trypsin (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, was mixed with 5 μl of test samples and incubated for 15 min in the plate wells. Then, 10 μl of 5 mm S-2222 (Chromogenix, Molndal, Sweden) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, were added and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 10% acetic acid, and absorbance at 405 nm was read by the plate reader (Nunc). For α2M, 50 μl of the above trypsin solution were mixed with 5 μl of test samples and incubated for 15 min. Then, 10 μl of soybean trypsin inhibitor (2.5 mg/ml) was added and incubated for 10 min followed by the incubation for 10 min with 10 μl of 5 mm S-2222. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10% acetic acid, and absorbance at 405 nm was read in the plate reader. Note that the α2M activity correlates with the remaining trypsin activity. α1PI was inactivated according to Johnson and Travis (17.Johnson D. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4022-4026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); 0.1 mg of human α1PI (Calbiochem) in 40 μl of 0.1 m Tris buffer, pH 8.8, was mixed with 10 μl of 80 mm N-chlorosuccinimide (Sigma) and incubated overnight. The excess of the reagent was removed using a centricon concentrator (Amicon). The remaining α1PI activity was less than 1 × 10−4of the original activity. α2M was inactivated by treating with 0.2 m methylamine in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, for 6 h at room temperature. After dialysis against 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, the remaining activity was measured as described above, and the activity was not detected. After examining cell spreading, 50 μl of plasmin (5 mg/ml) in 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 8.0, was overlaid on the fibrin gel, and the plates were shaken for 3 h at room temperature to dissolve the fibrin. The samples were then centrifuged for 1 min in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm. Ten microliters of the supernatants, 40 μl of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 10 μl of 1.6 mm S-2238 (Chromogenix) were mixed in the plate wells and incubated for 20 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10% acetic acid, and absorbance at 405 nm was read. After observing the cell spreading, 25 μl of 25% SDS was overlaid on the fibrin gel. Most of the gels were dissolved after being shaken for 1 h. Insoluble materials, if any, were removed by centrifugation. The samples were run on 8% SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp.). The membrane was blotted with anti-fibronectin antibody at 1:10,000 dilution, and the antigen was visualized with Renaissance Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (NEN Life Science Products). Band intensity was measured using a computer-assisted system. Purified proteins were run on 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membrane, and stained briefly by Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The protein bands were cut out and subjected to sequence analysis according to Matsudaira (18.Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An Applied Biosystems Sequencer, model 477A, connected to Analyzer 120A was used for the analysis. The cell spreading activity was measured as described under “Materials and Methods” using smooth muscle cell line originating from the aorta of the newborn infant (11.Liaw L. Skinner M.P. Raines E.W. Ross R. Cheresh D.A. Schwartz S.M. Giachelli C.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 713-724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,12.Perez-Reyes N. Halbert C.L. Smith P.P. Benditt E.P. McDougall J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1224-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The assay produced consistent results within 10% variations (see Figs. 1C, 4, and 6). In the presence of human plasma, the cells were well spread in 24 h in fibrin gel formed from recombinant fibrinogen (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, spreading is not observed in the plasma-free gel (Fig.1 B). The cells similarly spread regardless of the source of fibrinogen, recombinant fibrinogen, or plasma-derived fibrinogen. Fetal bovine serum, mature bovine plasma, and human serum also promote cell spreading in the same fashion (data not shown). With bovine fetal serum, the cells steadily spread in 6 h and slowly afterward in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 C). In order to identify cell spreading factors present in plasma or serum, we tested several adhesion molecules if they promote the cell spreading in fibrin gel. The addition of vitronectin, fibronectin, or osteopontin to the fibrin gel has no effect on the cell spreading (Fig.1 D), although these factors were able to promote the cell spreading on plastic surfaces. Surprisingly, vitronectin, which has been shown to be a “serum spreading factor” for the cells spreading on glass or plastic surface (9.Preissner K.T. Blut. 1989; 59: 419-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 10.Tomasini B.R. Mosher D.F. Prog. Hemostasis Thromb. 1991; 10: 269-305PubMed Google Scholar), does not promote the cell spreading in fibrin gel. Other possible factors, thrombospondin-1 and PAI-1 also fail to promote the cell spreading. These results suggest that a novel factor(s) is present in plasma or serum to promote the vascular smooth muscle cell spreading in fibrin gel. We fractionated the plasma into six fractions by ammonium sulfate precipitation at 0–30, 30–40, 40–50, 50–60, 60–70, and >70% saturation. After the ammonium sulfate was removed by dialysis, these samples were assayed for the spreading activity as described under “Materials and Methods.” The activity was found in two fractions, 30–40 and 60–70%, indicating that at least two kinds of factors are present in the plasma. The factors present in these fractions were purified as detailed under “Materials and Methods.” The activity in the 60–70% ammonium sulfate fraction was purified by a combination of ion-exchange and hydrophobic interaction columns. Fig.2 A is the chromatographic pattern of a second phenyl-Sepharose column. The fractions at the descending edge of the major peak contain the high cell spreading activities. After trace contaminants were removed using the chelating column, the purified protein gave a single 58-kDa band on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3 A). This protein has a single N-terminal sequence, LPENVTPEEQHKGTS, which is identical with bovine α1-proteinase inhibitor (α1PI) (19.Sinha D. Yang X. Emig F. Kirby E.P. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). From the sequence and the observed molecular weight, the spreading factor in this fraction is identified as α1PI, a serine proteinase inhibitor. Bovine α1PI has an activity similar to human α1PI (or α1-antitrypsin) and has a homologousN-terminal sequence with α1ACT (19.Sinha D. Yang X. Emig F. Kirby E.P. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The purified α1PI inhibits 0.86 mol of trypsin/mol of protein.Figure 3SDS-PAGE of purified proteins.

Lane 1, nonreduced samples; lane 2, reduced samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We speculated that the spreading factor in the 30–40% ammonium sulfate fraction is α2-macroglobulin (α2M) for two reasons. First, it could also be another proteinase inhibitor. Second, α2M precipitates at a low ammonium sulfate concentration while many other plasma proteinase inhibitors precipitate at high ammonium sulfate concentrations. Therefore, the chromatographic conditions previously developed for the purification of bovine α2M (20.Nagasawa S. Sugihara H. Han B.H. Suzuki T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1970; 67: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) were adopted. It was purified by ion exchange and gel filtration column. Fig. 2 B shows the gel filtration pattern on Superose-6 column. The activity found in the first peak is further purified by Sepharose 4B column to remove trace contaminants. SDS-PAGE of the finally purified protein exhibits a typical gel migration pattern of the homotetramer of α2M. Double bands with high molecular weights are seen under the nonreduced condition, while a single band with 180 kDa is observed under reduced condition (Fig. 3 B). The commercial α2M migrates at the same positions as the purified protein under both reduced and nonreduced conditions. It is known that α2M is transformed to an inactive form by contact with ammonium ions at pH 8 or higher (21.Barrett A.J. Brown M.A. Sayers C.A. Biochem. J. 1979; 181: 401-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The inactive form migrates faster than the active form. The intensity of the two bands appeared on nonreduced gel (Fig. 3 B, lane 1) indicates that about one-quarter of the product is inactivated but three-quarters remain intact. The inactivation probably occurred during the ammonium sulfate fractionation, where α2M was exposed to pH 6.8. By titration with trypsin, the purified α2M inactivates 2.9 mol of trypsin/mol of protein, indicating that 73% of the protein is the active form. The sequence analysis gave a single N-terminal sequence, AVDGVEPQYM, which is identical with the reported bovine α2M sequence. To confirm the above results, we tested if the commercial preparations of α1PI, α1ACT, and α2M can promote the cell spreading. All three inhibitors from human source are able to promote the cell spreading in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4 A). To achieve 40% spreading, 2.3 × 10−6m of α1PI or α1ACT is required, whereas 9.2 × 10−8m of α2M is sufficient. Therefore, the cell spreading activity of α2M is 40-fold higher than α1PI and α1ACT. Because α2M has 4 reactive sites/mol, the cell spreading activity should be only 4 times higher than the others. Assuming that the commercial α2M is fully active, the activity of α2M is 10 times higher than the others. The cell spreading activities of PAI-1 and aprotinin inhibitor are null. Other serine proteinase inhibitors, α2-antiplasmin and C1 inhibitor, are also unable to promote the cell spreading (data not shown). To examine whether the entire cell spreading activity of human serum is attributed to the three proteinase inhibitors, we made a mixture that contains all three proteinase inhibitors at the normal serum concentrations, α1PI at 4.5 × 10−5m (2.5 mg/ml), α1ACT at 4.3 × 10−6m (0.25 mg/ml) and α2M at 3.5 × 10−6m (2.5 mg/ml) and tested its cell spreading activity. This mixture can promote the cell spreading with the same dose dependence as that obtained with human serum (Fig.4 B). As a control, albumin had no effect on the cell spreading at its serum concentration (40 mg/ml). We next deprived α1PI, α2M, or both from human serum by immunoprecipitation and tested the remaining cell spreading activity. Note that the positive control was able to induce fewer cell spreading in this experiment since the serum was diluted 500 times through the immunoprecipitation. 40% of the cell spreading activity is lost by the removal of each one of these inhibitors, and 95% of the activity is lost by the simultaneous removal of both proteins (Fig. 4 C). The remaining 5% activity is probably due to the presence of α1ACT. We could not determine the contribution of this inhibitor, because an appropriate antibody against α1ACT is not available. These and above results demonstrate that the three proteinase inhibitors, α1PI, α1ACT, and α2M, contribute together to the entire cell spreading activity of serum or plasma. First we tested whether these proteins function as adhesion molecules on plastic surfaces under the conditions as described before (22.Yee K.O. Rooney M.M. Giachelli C.M. Lord S.T. Schwartz S.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The smooth muscle cells do not attach to the surfaces coated with α1PI, α1ACT, or α2M. In contrast, the cells remain attached to the plastic surface coated with fibronectin or vitronectin (data not shown). These results indicate that these inhibitors do not function as adhesion molecules. We next studied whether the inhibitory activity of these proteins is required for the cell spreading in fibrin gel. α1PI was inactivated by treating withN-chlorosuccinimide, a selective oxidant of the essential methionine residue (17.Johnson D. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4022-4026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibitor activity is diminished to less than 1 × 10−4 of the original activity, and the cell spreading activity in fibrin gel is completely lost. To inactivate α2M, it was incubated with methylamine. The inhibitory activity of α2M was completely inactivated and the ability of the spreading activity also disappeared (data not shown). We could not perform the inactivation of α1ACT because an effective method is not found in the literature. Despite the lack of α1ACT data, these results clearly indicate that the proteinase inhibitory activity of these proteins is required for the cell spreading in fibrin gel. Because we use trypsin for harvesting the cells and thrombin for the fibrin gel formation, it is necessary to eliminate the possibility that these enzymes cause experimental artifacts. These possibilities can be ruled out from the following experiments. α1PI, α1ACT, or α2M is required for the cell spreading when the cell suspension is prepared by scrapping the cells from the cultured plates without using trypsin (data not shown). Two inhibitors specific to thrombin, antithrombin III andd-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine chloromethylketone, have no effect on the cell spreading. When these inhibitors are overlaid on fibrin gel, the cells do not spread, although the thrombin activity is completely inhibited. In the presence of serum or α1PI, the cell spreading activity is observed, and the thrombin activity is diminished to half of the original activity (data not shown). At this point, we hypothesized that a proteinase(s) secreted from the cells inhibits the cell spreading activity by destroying adhesion molecules essential to the cell spreading, and the proteinase inhibitors prevent their degradation. The smooth muscle cell line expresses a large number of integrins including α2, α3, α5, αv, β1, β3, and β5 (22.Yee K.O. Rooney M.M. Giachelli C.M. Lord S.T. Schwartz S.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because two integrins, αvβ3 and α5β1, are known to be responsible for fibrin gel contraction (22.Yee K.O. Rooney M.M. Giachelli C.M. Lord S.T. Schwartz S.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we tested if these two integrins are involved in the cell spreading in our system. Two anti-integrin antibodies, LM609 (αvβ3) and P4C10 (β1), completely inhibited the cell spreading when they were added to the fibrin gel together with α1PI, α1ACT, α2M, or calf serum (Fig.5 A). Similarly, when a polyclonal anti-fibronectin antibody (R790) was added to the fibrin gel at 0.1 mg/ml, the cell spreading diminished to 25–30% (Fig.5 B). However, the addition of the polyclonal anti-vitronectin antibody at 0.4 mg/ml had no effect on the cell spreading (data not shown). This concentration of the antibody was sufficient to inhibit the cell adhesion to the vitronectin-coated plastic plates (22.Yee K.O. Rooney M.M. Giachelli C.M. Lord S.T. Schwartz S.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because no fibronectin is added to fibrin gel, fibronectin must be derived from the cells. In fact, we have shown that the same cell line produces fibronectin on their surfaces. 2Y. Ikari, K. Fujikawa, K. O. Yee, and S. M. Schwartz, unpublished observation. We then tested whether fibronectin is degraded in fibrin gel in the absence of the proteinase inhibitors or serum. After the cell spread in fibrin gel, the fate of fibronectin was examined by Western blot analysis as described under “Materials and Methods.” Since recombinant human fibrinogen is contaminated with hamster fibronectin from CHO cells, 3K. O. Yee, unpublished observation. we used fibronectin-free human fibrinogen. Therefore, bands shown in Fig.6 A are considered to be human fibronectin that is secreted from the cells. Without serum or the inhibitors, fibronectin was degraded into smaller fragments (Fig.6 A, lane 1), and the cells did not spread. α1PI, α1ACT, α2M, or serum prevents fibronectin degradation (lanes 2–5), and the cell spread normally in fibrin gel. In dose-response conditions, band intensities of intact fibronectin was linear to the concentration of α1PI (Fig. 6, Band C). The experiments with α1ACT or α2M showed the same linear pattern as α1PI (data not shown). Serum has long been recognized to contain molecules required for cell spreading. Vitronectin and other serum proteins that contain RGD sequences have been implicated as the factors to promote cell spreading (23.Barnes D.W. Silnutzer J. See C. Shaffer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1362-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 24.Hayman E.G. Pierschbacher M.D. Ohgren Y. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4003-4007Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). From the data presented in this study, we propose a novel mechanism of the smooth muscle cell spreading in fibrin gel. In this mechanism, vitronectin does not appear to be critical to the cell spreading, whereas cell-derived fibronectin and integrins are required. The spreading is also dependent on extraneous serine proteinase inhibitors, which protect the degradation of fibronectin. If the proteinase inhibitors are not present, fibronectin is degraded by a proteinase(s) secreted from the cells. Therefore, the cells are not able to spread in fibrin gel. Is the cell spreading mechanism in fibrin matrix different from cell adhesion on a plastic surface? To clarify this question, we performed cell adhesion assays with or without proteinase inhibitors on a plastic surface coated with fibronectin, vitronectin, or fibrin. As previously reported (22.Yee K.O. Rooney M.M. Giachelli C.M. Lord S.T. Schwartz S.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), attachment was similar with or without the proteinase inhibitors on all surfaces at 1 h. However, at 24 h, almost all the cells had detached and looked round. In contrast, with proteinase inhibitors, the cells remained attached and spread at 24 h (data not shown). Short observation times in cell attachment studies have probably concealed this effect. Neutralization of cell-derived proteolytic enzyme(s) is necessary to keep matrices intact. This can be ignored within 1 h; however, it should be taken into account in cell attachment in vivo as well as in reactions over 24 h in vitro. Therefore, our data do not contradict the usual concept of vitronectin as an inducer of cell spreading. In vitro studies have shown multiple functions for vitronectin including cell adhesion, cytolysis, thrombosis, fibrinolysis, and inflammation (9.Preissner K.T. Blut. 1989; 59: 419-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 10.Tomasini B.R. Mosher D.F. Prog. Hemostasis Thromb. 1991; 10: 269-305PubMed Google Scholar). Vitronectin is obviously able to support cell adherence via the RGD motif that binds integrins, primarily αvβ3. Thus, RGD-containing proteins such as vitronectin and osteopontin have been implicated as critical molecules in several morphogenic processes (25.Giachelli C.M. Liaw L. Murry C.E. Schwartz S.M. Almeida M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 760: 109-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In contrast, knock-out studies of vitronectin or osteopontin have so far not shown any specific function for these proteins (26.Zheng X. Saunders T.L. Camper S.A. Samuelson L.C. Ginsburg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12426-12430Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 27.Liaw L. Birk D.E. Ballas C.B. Whitsitt J.S. Davidson J.M. Hogan B.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1468-1478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A role of proteinase inhibitors in morphogenesis has been of interest in two areas, angiogenesis and mechanism of PAI-1 on cell adhesion. Montesano et al. (28.Montesano R. Pepper M.S. Vassalli J.D. Orci L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 132: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) showed that angiogenesis could be modeled by treating endothelial cells with phorbol ester. Without proteinase inhibitors, these cells dissolve the fibrin matrix. In contrast, capillary-like sprouts form in the presence of Trasylol (aprotinin) or after depletion of plasminogen. The authors conclude that neutralization of excess proteolytic activity of plasmin may play an important permissive role in angiogenesis. In our model, cell spreading was not supported by aprotinin (Fig. 4 A) or plasminogen depletion (data not shown), probably because the responsible proteinase(s) is different from plasmin. PAI-1 is associated with the extracellular matrix and supports cell adhesion (29.Planus E. Barlovatz-Meimon G. Rogers R.A. Bonavaud S. Ingber D.E. Wang N. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, PAI-1 can act as an inhibitor of cell adhesion by competing with vitronectin for binding to αvβ3 (30.Deng G. Curriden S.A. Wang S. Rosenberg S. Loskutoff D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). However, these functions of PAI-1 do not depend on its antiproteinase activity. It is important to note that the proteinase inhibitors are ubiquitous. Proteinase inhibitors are the third major group of plasma proteins next to albumin and globulin. α1PI is a universal inhibitor of serine proteinases. Since lack of α1PI causes pulmonary emphysema and liver fibrosis, the physiological role of α1PI has been considered as an elastase inhibitor (31.Travis J. Salvesen G.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 655-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar). α2M can block almost any type of proteinases. α2M is an ancient protein that is found in all vertebrates and even in nonvertebrates such as eels and crabs, suggesting that α2M is an essential protein in animals (32.Starkey P.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1983; 421: 112-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). While it is speculated that α2M is a carrier of transforming growth factor-β and other cytokines (33.Falcone D.J. McCaffrey T.A. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Garcia M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) or as an agonist of α2M receptors (34.Howard G.C. Misra U.K. DeCamp D.L. Pizzo S.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1193-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), no α2M genetic deficiency has been found in our species despite extensive screening of human plasma (31.Travis J. Salvesen G.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 655-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar). Furthermore, α2M knock-out mice have no phenotype (35.Umans L. Serneels L. Overbergh L. Lorent K. Van Leuven F. Van den Berghe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19778-19785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). α1ACT is a chymotrypsin type serine proteinase inhibitor. α1ACT has been recognized as an acute phase protein, since serum concentration of α1ACT increases rapidly and dramatically after a variety of events including surgery, burn injury, and some types of cancer (31.Travis J. Salvesen G.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 655-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that up-regulation of α1ACT may assist in wound repair by facilitating cell migration and proliferation. Furthermore, several cancers are known to express α1ACT, and the expression of α1ACT predicts a poor prognosis (36.Higashiyama M. Doi O. Yokouchi H. Kodama K. Nakamori S. Tateishi R. Cancer. 1995; 76: 1368-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that production of α1ACT may support cell attachment even where plasma proteinase inhibitor cannot reach. The attachment may support cell proliferation and resist apoptosis. Furthermore, not only human smooth muscle cells but also other cell lines, mouse fibroblasts, and rat smooth muscle cells, require proteinase inhibitors to spread in fibrin gel (data not shown). This spreading mechanism may be universal regardless of cell types. The alternative possibility is that the inhibitors block activation of proteinase-activated receptors (37.D'ery O. Corvera C.U. Steinhoff M. Bunnett N.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1429-C1452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We tested thrombin receptor (proteinase-activated receptor-1) knock-out mouse fibroblasts for cell spreading. These cells still required proteinase inhibitors for cell spreading (data not shown). Other receptors not likely to be involved are the receptors for α2M (34.Howard G.C. Misra U.K. DeCamp D.L. Pizzo S.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1193-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 38.Ashcom J.D. Tiller S.E. Dickerson K. Cravens J.L. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 39.Jensen P.H. Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These receptors recognize α2M complexed with proteinase or α2M treated with methylamine. However, receptor-recognizable α2M has no activity on cell spreading. The final obvious question is the identity of the target proteinase(s). Based on the specificity of α1PI and α1ACT, the major counterpart proteinase(s) should be chymotrypsin type serine proteinase(s), although higher activity of α2M than α1PI and α1ACT (Fig. 3 A) may suggest the existence of other minor active proteinases. Matrix metalloproteinases, well known cell-derived proteinases (40.Nagase H. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 151-160PubMed Google Scholar), are unlikely to be the major enzyme, because they are not serine proteinases and because an inhibitor of MMPs (GM 6001) (41.Bendeck M.P. Irvin C. Reidy M.A. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) had no effect on spreading (data not shown). Over 20 human chymotrypsin type serine proteinases have been identified (42.Perona J.J. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29987-29990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), including pancreatic chymotrypsin and prostate-specific antigen, which is widely used as a marker of prostate cancer. We detected a chymotrypsin type enzyme activity in the culture medium using chromogenic substrate (S-2586). However, biochemical purification has not been attempted, because a huge amount of cells is required. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that human smooth muscle cells spread in fibrin gel not only with the known spreading factors, but also with the proteinase inhibitors, α1PI, α1ACT, and α2M. These proteinase inhibitors may also control basic cell behavior and affect the progression of several pathological conditions. We are indebted to Brad McMullen (Department of Biochemistry, University of Washington) for performing the protein sequencing."
https://openalex.org/W2013040802,"Iron release process of ovotransferrin N-lobe (N-oTf) to anion/chelators has been resolved using kinetic and mechanistic approach. The iron release kinetics of N-oTf were measured at the endosomal pH of 5.6 with three different anions such as nitrilotriacetate, pyrophosphate, and sulfate using stopped flow spectrofluorimetric method, all yielding clear biphasic progress curves. The two observed rate constants and the corresponding amplitudes obtained from the double exponential curve fit to the biphasic curves varied depending on the type and concentration of anions. Several possible models for the iron release kinetic mechanism were examined on the basis of a newly introduced quantitative equation. Results from the curve fitting analyses were consistent with a dual pathway mechanism that includes the competitive iron release from two different protein states, namely, X and Y, with the respective first order rate constants of K 1 andK 2 (X, domain closed holo N-oTf; Y, anion induced different conformer of holo N-oTf). The reversible interconversions of X to Y and Y to X are driven by the second order rate constant k 3 and the first order rate constant K 4, respectively. The obtained rate constants were greatly variable for the three anions depending on the synergistic or nonsynergistic nature.

N-lobe of human serum transferrin N-lobe of ovotransferrin C-terminal monoferric human serum transferrin N-terminal monoferric human serum transferrin nitrilotriacetate human serum transferrin 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid Transferrins are a class of bilobal proteins that bind, transport, and release various metals such as iron, aluminum, copper, and bismuth of which the key interest is to study the uptake and release of iron by transferrins because it is abundant and also plays a significant role in many biological processes (1.Aisen P. Listowsky I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 357-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar, 2.Baker E.N. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1994; 41: 389-463Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Each lobe of transferrin binds one Fe3+ ion in the interdomain cleft in presence of a synergistic anion (biologically, carbonate) with similar chemistry but with different affinity (3.Aisen P. Leibman A. Zweier J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1930-1937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Lin L.-N. Mason A.B. Woodworth R.C. Brandts J.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1881-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Although the main core of structure is similar in both the lobes (N and C), the chemistry is remarkably dissimilar toward the interaction of nonsynergistic anions (5.Oe H. Takahashi N. Doi E. Hirose M. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 858-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), disulfide bridges (6.Williams J. Elleman T.C. Kingston B. Wilkins A.G. Kuhin K.A. Eur. J.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11036-11043Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Physiologically, low molecular weight chelators/anions play a vital role in the iron exchange reactions with transferrins, and the rate of iron release from the N-lobe of transferrins is more facile compared with its counterpart, either in the full-length molecule or in the independent half molecule (9.Kretchmar S.A. Raymond K.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 6212-6218Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 14.Bali P.K. Harris W.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 4457-4461Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The molecular details of origin of such differences are poorly understood. However, a significant difference has been the dilysine trigger in case of N-lobe and kinetically significant anion-binding site in C-lobe, each of which are proposed to be absent in the respective counterparts (13.Zak O. Tam B. MacGillivray R.T.A. Aisen P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11036-11043Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15.Dewan J.C. Mikami B. Hirose M. Sacchettini J.C.

Addition of simple nonsynergistic anions such as chloride accelerates the chelator mediated iron release from C-lobe but retards release from N-lobe either in full-length structure or in the independent lobe (12.Zak O.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5522-5528Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Anion effect was also shown to vary with pH-dependent conformational change in N-hTf where chloride retards iron release at high pH but accelerates at low pH (18.He Q-Y. Mason A.B. Woodworth R.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The exact location of nonsynergistic anion-binding site(s) on either lobe is/are not fully known. A recent site-directed mutagenesis study shows that the Lys296 of the dilysine pair, Lys206-Lys296, is one of the anion-binding site residues on N-hTf1 (19.He Q.-Y. Mason A.B. Tam B.M.

The iron-binding site on each lobe of transferrin involves two tyrosine residues, one each of aspartic acid and histidine residues. The remaining two ionic coordinates of iron are shared by a synergistic bicarbonate anion that anchors using an arginine residue of the protein. Hence, recently a number of iron release studies are focused using mutants of these functional sites of transferrin or its isolated lobes to delineate the mechanism (13.Zak O. Tam B.

A recent report emphasizes the slow protonation of iron-binding residues of ovotransferrin for the iron release process at acidic pH in the absence of anionic chelators (29.Bou Abdallah F. El Hage Chahine J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 912-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Apart from the location of nonsynergistic anion-binding sites, there is a lacuna in the quantitative evaluation of the kinetic data with a suitable model applicable for different anions. The kinetic inequivalence between the two lobes in addition to nonsynergistic anion requirement and inter-lobe interaction makes the process much more complex in diferric transferrins. At large, the kinetic process of iron release was evaluated by using observed rate constant (k obs), which is obtained by single exponential curve fit analysis of the raw data (11.Marques H.M.

The saturation kinetics (hyperbolic) obtained with N-hTf showed first order kinetics (linear) for its R124A mutant for the same anion (25.Li Y. Harris W.R. Maxwell A. MacGillivray R.T.A. Brown T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14157-14166Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However from the kinetic analysis methods used the origin of such differential behavior was not clear. In this present complexity iron release kinetic mechanism of N-oTf was studied using three anions of different chemical nature: pyrophosphate, a chelator and nonsynergistic anion; NTA, a chelator and synergistic anion; and sulfate, a nonchelator and nonsynergistic anion. We have opted for isolated N-oTf because the solution and crystallographic structural details of iron binding and the intermediate complex of iron uptake are reported from this laboratory (15.Dewan J.C. Mikami B. Hirose M. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11963-11968Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 31.Kurokawa H. Mikami B. Hirose M. J. Biol.

(2000) Biochemistry, 39, in pressGoogle Scholar). The kinetic data was obtained using the stopped flow spectrofluorimetric method at the endosomal pH of 5.6 and single anion system at a time, for the iron release process of three different anions. Several kinetic models were analyzed by the newly introduced method to obtain the rate constants for the quantitative evaluation of the iron release kinetics. The crystallographic structure of nonsynergistic anion bound apo N-oTf (33.Mizutani, K., Yamashita, H., Mikami, B., and Hirose, M. (2000) Biochemistry, 39, in pressGoogle Scholar) along with the holo (15.Dewan J.C. Mikami B. Hirose M. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11963-11968Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and iron uptake intermediate (32.Mizutani K. Yamashita H. Kurokawa H. Mikami B. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10190-10194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) structures of N-oTf were critically analyzed to derive a mechanistic model compatible with the dual pathway kinetic mechanism. N-oTf was prepared by the established procedure (34.Oe H. Doi E. Hirose M. J. Biochem. 1988; 103: 1066-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was measured in the apo form, and iron-bound holo form was prepared freshly in 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, using (Fe3+-NTA) complex as the iron donor and a large excess of bicarbonate as the synergistic anion to replace bound NTA. Holo N-oTf was then equilibrated to 50 mm Mes, pH 5.6, by dialysis, and the bound iron was confirmed spectrophotometrically to retain a 1:1 molar ratio with the protein. An N-oTf concentration of 5.5 μm was used in all the iron release experiments. Guaranteed grade of chemicals (pyrophosphoric acid from Wako Pure Chemicals; NTA and Na2SO4 from Nacalai Tesque), nitric acid-washed glassware and double distilled, deionized, and 40 μmfiltered water were used. Extreme care was taken to avoid any metal contamination or alteration of pH in all the solutions. All of the anion stock solutions were prepared freshly just before use in 50 mm Mes, and the pH was adjusted to 5.60 using NaOH and readjusted to 5.60 for minor changes, if any, upon dilution of anion stock solutions. The principle of nonradiative resonance energy transfer from excited aromatic chromophores to the visible charge transfer band of bound iron in transferrin (35.Lehrer S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3613-3617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which was successfully used to measure the iron release kinetics in transferrins, was adopted for our studies with minor modifications (12.Zak O. Aisen P. Crawley J.B. Joannou C.L. Patel K.J. Rafiq M. Evans R.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14428-14434Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar,21.Egan T.J. Zak O. Aisen P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8162-8167Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The kinetic data was precisely obtained by 1:1 sample mixing on a SX.18MV stopped flow reaction analyzer (Applied Photophysics Ltd., UK), which has the dead time of 4 ms. The excitation and emission wavelengths, 288 and 330 nm, respectively, were set on two different monochromators with a bandpass of 9.3 nm. A photomultiplier voltage of 600 mV with the reaction temperature of 30 ± 0.1 °C maintained using an external water bath and 50 mm Mes, pH 5.6, because the reaction buffer did not contribute to iron release from holo N-oTf in the absence of added anions used in the present study. The instrument conditions applied did not denature either apo or holo N-oTf even after 500 s of exposure, which was confirmed by the respective fluorescence emission properties. The data were collected using “oversampling mode,” which allows fast and accurate pickup and averaging of data points with improved signal-to-noise ratio over the extended time of measurements. A minimum of 1000 data points were collected per trace on a time scale of 0–500 s, and at least three identical traces were averaged for each anion concentration. The averaged traces were best fit using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to the following double exponential curve fit equation using the built-in software (version 4.36) on an Acorn Risc computer interfaced to the main instrument.Z(t)=1−A1 exp(−r1t)−A2 exp(−r2t)Equation 1 Z(t) is the fraction of iron-released (apo) form as detected by the change in fluorescence emission signal at time t, and A 1 andA 2 are the fractions of the fluorescence amplitudes (A 1 + A 2 = 1) for the observed rate constants r 1 andr 2 (r 1 >r 2), respectively. For the curve fit of raw data of all the three anions at different concentrations the normalized variance was between 6 × 10−7 and 6 × 10−8. The data derived from this primary analysis (r 1, r 2,A 1, and A 2) were plotted as a function of anion concentrations, and the curve fitting analyses by Equations Equation 3, Equation 4, Equation 5, Equation 6, Equation 7, Equation 8 (see “Results”) were carried out using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (KaleidaGraph, Synergy Software). Iron release kinetics of N-oTf were studied using three anions of different chemical nature: NTA, which can act both as a chelator and a synergistic anion; pyrophosphate, a strong nonsynergistic chelator anion; and sulfate, a simple nonsynergistic anion that can form a coordination complex with iron. In Fig.1 is shown a typical example of a clear biphasic progress curve of iron release from N-oTf to 100 mm NTA (A), 10 mm pyrophosphate (B), and 200 mm sulfate (C). The profiles can be demarcated by an initial rapid step followed by a slow hyperbolic step, both of which vary with the type and concentration of anion. For NTA the initial rapid process is significantly slow compared with the other two anions, and to emphasize the initial rapid phase the data within 20 s is shown as respective insets in Fig.1. The initial rapid process is very dominant in the case of pyrophosphate even below 5 mm concentrations but did not induce complete iron removal within the time frame of 500 s used in all the experiments. A similar observation was made in the case of sulfate, but in the case of NTA the initial rapid process was not clearly distinguishable below 10 mm concentration. For data analysis the anion concentrations that induce complete iron release within 500 s were considered. Sulfate and NTA below 20 mm and pyrophosphate below 10 mm did not induce complete iron removal. Biphasic progress curves of complete iron release from single iron-binding site of transferrin, either in the isolated N-lobe or in the selectively iron loaded N-lobe of full-length transferrin, have been observed for the first time with N-oTf. Iron release studies either with N-hTF or hTf-FeN were performed at different pH values, and only monophasic progress curves were obtained and curve fit to single exponential (16.Egan T.J. Ross D.

Iron release from C-lobe of ovotransferrin at pH 5.6 showed monophasic progress curves with different types and concentrations of anions under identical experimental conditions used for N-oTf. 2B. K. Muralidhara and M. Hirose, manuscript in preparation. The monophasic progress curves at acidic pH were also observed with hTf-FeC (11.Marques H.M. Walton T. Egan T.J. J. Inorg.

In Fig. 1, the solid line represents the best fit line to Equation 1 in all the three anion cases. The normalized variance for all the double exponential curve fits were in the order of 10−7 to 10−8, indicating the excellent fit. The two observed rate constants (r 1 and r 2) obtained from the curve fit are plotted as a function of NTA (A), pyrophosphate (B), and sulfate concentration (C) in Fig. 2. Only anion concentrations that yield complete iron removal were considered for analysis, and in the case of sulfate, higher concentrations were required to achieve complete iron removal. The larger rate constants (r 1) are increased almost linearly with anion concentration in all the three cases, and they are about one order lower in case of NTA compared with sulfate and pyrophosphate, at identical concentrations, although the values for pyrophosphate are more than twice compared with sulfate. The smaller rate constants (r 2) did not follow a linear relationship with anion concentration; instead, they follow an apparent hyperbolic pattern in all the three anion cases. The values are of the same order for NTA and sulfate but are of about five times smaller compared with pyrophosphate. The fractional amplitude data was obtained from the double exponential curve fit of the biphasic raw data to Equation 1 yielding two amplitudes, A 1 and A 2 for the observed rate constants r 1 andr 2, respectively. In Fig.3 is shown the pattern of variation of fractional amplitude as a function of NTA (A"

The surface charge distribution analysis of their three-dimensional structures revealed that the N-terminal domains of GreA and GreB contain a small and large basic “patch,” respectively. To elucidate the functional role of basic patch, mutant Gre proteins were engineered in which the size and charge distribution of basic patch were modified and characterized biochemically. We found that Gre mutants lacking basic patch or carrying basic patch of decreased size bind to RNA polymerase and induce transcript cleavage reaction in minimally backtracked ternary elongation complex (TEC) with the same efficiency as the wild type factors. However, they exhibit substantially lower readthrough and cleavage activities toward extensively backtracked and arrested TECs and display decreased efficiency of photocross-linking to the RNA 3′-terminus. Unlike wild type factors, basic patch-less Gre mutants are unable to complement the thermosensitive phenotype of GreA–:GreB– E. coli strain. The large basic patch is required but not sufficient for the induction of GreB-type cleavage reaction and for the cleavage of arrested TECs. Our results demonstrate that the basic patch residues are not directly involved in the induction of transcript cleavage reaction and suggest that the primary role of basic patch is to anchor the nascent RNA in TEC. These interactions are essential for the readthrough and antiarrest activities of Gre factors and, apparently, for theirin vivo functions.

The ubiquity of transcript cleavage factors in nature underscores their biological importance. Although gre and SII genes are not essential for cell viability, the deletion of these genes in Escherichia coli and S. cerevisiae renders them sensitive to certain growth conditions, such as elevated temperatures (10.Orlova M.

Lacroute F. Ruet A. Friesen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4142-4152Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The factor-stimulated cleavage of RNA occurs 2–18 bases upstream from the 3′-terminus, followed by dissociation of the 3′-proximal fragment from TEC. The 5′-proximal fragment of the transcript remains in TEC and can be extended in the presence of rNTPs. GreA induces hydrolysis of predominantly di- and trinucleotides (type A cleavage activity), whereas SII and GreB induce cleavage of 2–18-nucleotide-long RNA fragments (type B cleavage activity) (2.Borukhov S.

In the absence of factors, the endonucleolytic activity of RNAP can be induced by pyrophosphate (23.Rudd M.D. Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8057-8061Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) or at alkaline pH (10.Orlova M. Newlands J. Das A. Goldfarb A. Borukhov S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4596-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), indicating that the same active center of RNAP is responsible for the cleavage reaction, as well as for pyrophosphorolysis and RNA synthesis reactions. The precise molecular mechanism by which Gre factors activate the endonucleolytic activity of RNAP is not known. The cleavage reaction mediated by Gre and SII factors is believed to be an integral part of the mechanism that allows RNAP to overcome obstacles encountered during elongation in vivo, such as pausing and arresting sites in the DNA sequences, nucleosomes, or DNA-binding proteins and drugs (6, reviewed in Ref. 24.Uptain S.M. Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 117-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Although there are no direct in vivo data to support this, many in vitro studies have shown that SII and GreB can rescue arrested TECs (2.Borukhov S. Sagitov V. Goldfarb A.

Backtracking of RNAP occurs when it is forced to stall during elongation and results in backward translocation of RNAP with simultaneous repositioning of its catalytic center from the 3′-terminus to an internal site of the transcript (25.Nudler E.

The cleavage of 3′-terminal segment of RNA induced by GreB and SII in arrested TEC allows RNAP to restart transcription from a newly generated 3′-terminus, which is now properly aligned with its catalytic center (“antiarrest activity”) (2.Borukhov S.

Unlike GreB, GreA is unable to induce cleavages in preformed arrested TECs and to reactivate them (1.Borukhov S. Polyakov A. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8899-8902Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 2.Borukhov S. Sagitov V. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1993; 72: 459-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 21.Feng G.H. Lee D.N. Wang D. Chan C.L. Landick R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22282-22294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, GreA and GreB were shown to prevent elongating TECs from falling into an arrested conformation (“readthrough activity”) (1.Borukhov S. Polyakov A. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The functional selectivity of GreA may be related to its ability to induce cleavage of only short RNAs. Besides readthrough/antiarrest function, the factor-induced transcript cleavage reaction may play a part in the mechanisms that regulate transcription fidelity (29.Erie D.A. Hajiseyedjavadi O.

According to the established three-dimensional structures, GreA and GreB of E. coli share a similar overall structural organization (33.Stebbins C.E. Borukhov S. Orlova M. Polyakov A. Goldfarb A.

The NTD is responsible for the induction of type-specific nucleolytic activity by Gre factors (34.Koulich D. Orlova M. Malhotra A. Sali A. Darst S.A. Goldfarb A. Borukhov S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7201-7210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 35.Koulich D. Nikiforov V. Borukhov S. J. Mol.

The charge distribution analysis of three-dimensional structures revealed a cluster of positively charged residues on NTD of GreA and GreB that form a distinct structural feature, described as basic “patch,” on the side of the protein that is presumed to face RNAP in TEC. The basic patch residues of all known GreA and GreB molecules are highly conserved (Fig. 1). The photocross-linking experiments performed on various TECs have demonstrated that the 3′-terminus of RNA is located in the immediate vicinity of basic patch on both Gre proteins (33.Stebbins C.E. Borukhov S. Orlova M. Polyakov A. Goldfarb A. Darst S.A. Nature. 1995; 373: 636-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 34.Koulich D. Orlova M. Malhotra A. Sali A. Darst S.A. Goldfarb A. Borukhov S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7201-7210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), implicating basic patch in the functional interaction of Gre proteins with RNA in TEC. Additionally, the lengths of basic patch on GreA and GreB, ∼7 and ∼35 Å, respectively, were noted to correlate with the maximum lengths of RNA fragments that can be excised from TEC in the presence of Gre factors: 2–3 nucleotides for GreA and up to 18 nucleotides for GreB. Finally, it was observed that in the absence of factors, the nucleolytic activity of RNAP can be stimulated at a mildly alkaline pH, which mimics the effect of GreA (at pH 8.5–9.5) and GreB (at pH above 10.0) (10.Orlova M. Newlands J. Das A. Goldfarb A. Borukhov S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4596-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, two alternative hypotheses were proposed for the role of basic patch in Gre function: first, the basic patch residues increase the local pH near the active site of RNAP and directly affect its catalytic properties; second, they bind the nascent RNA by electrostatic interaction, thereby facilitating the cleavage reaction and determining the size of cleavage product. To test these hypotheses, we introduced a series of mutations in Gre proteins that would result in altered size and charge distribution of basic patch. The functional properties of mutant proteins were analyzed in vivo and in vitro. The results that we present rule out the first hypothesis and support the second, suggesting that the role of basic patch is to bind the 3′-terminal portion of the nascent RNA and to maintain it in proper orientation in TEC. Based on our results, we conclude that Gre-RNA interactions mediated through basic patch are essential for the readthrough and antiarrest functions of Gre factorsin vitro and for their activity in vivo.

The plasmid pMO1.1 carrying the wt greA gene and the plasmid pMO1.4His carrying the wt greB gene with C-terminal hexahistidine tag were used as templates for polymerase chain reaction preparation of the target greA andgreB mutants, respectively (34.Koulich D.

Because alteration of basic patch was expected to disrupt specific functions of Gre proteins, the cloning and selection of plasmids carrying mutant gre genes were performed in E. coli XL-Blue cells (Stratagene) in GreA+/GreB+-background to minimize the occurrence of spontaneous secondary null mutations. The DNA sequences were verified by dideoxy chain termination sequencing of the double stranded plasmid DNA.Table IList of Gre mutantsGre mutantsAmino acid substitutionsPlasmidsGreA-37AR37ApDKA37AGreA-52AR52ApDKA52AGreA-BPLR37A/R52ApDKABPLGreA-LBP2G60R/A67KpDKABPB2GreA-LBP3E53R/G60R/A67KpDKABPB3GreA-LBP4E53R/G56R/G60R/A67KpDKABPB4GreB-BPL2K52A/K53ApDKB52/53AGreB-BPL4K52A/K53A/R56A/R60ApDKBBPL4GreB-BPL5K52A/K53A/R56A/R60A/K67ApDKBBPL5GreB-BPL5-DDK52A/K53A/R56D/R60D/K67ApDKBDD Open table in a new tab The following oligonucleotides were used for polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis (underlined nucleotides define the restriction sites of the enzymes shown in parentheses; mutagenized residues of GreA and GreB are shown italicized): 1) 5′-GGTCGCCATGCTCAG CCGCTTCCGCGATAGC-3′ (GreA-R37A, DdeI); 2) 5′-ACCCTGCTGTTCAG CAGCTGCGTGGTATTCGGC-3′(GreA-R52A,PvuII); 3) 5′-GCGCGTTCGACAGCTTTTTTTCGATATCTTTAATACGGCGTTCGCAGAA-3′ (GreA: G60R/A67K, EcoRV); 4) 5′-TTCGCAGAAGCGCTGCTGTTTACGAGCTGCGTGG-3′ (GreA-E53K/G56R, HaeII); 5) 5′-GATTTCACGCAGACGT GCTGCATTATACTGATAGTC-3′ (GreB-K52/53A, MaeII); 6) 5′-GTGAGATAGCGCACGCG AGCGTCGATTTCAGCCAGACGTGCTGCATTATA-3′ (GreB-R56A/R60A, HgaI); 7) 5′-GAGATTTTCCAGGCACGCAGTGAGATAGCGCAC-3′ (GreB-K67A, DraIII); 8) 5′-GGCACGCAGTGAGATAGGCCACGCGATCG TCGATTTCATCCAGACGTGCTGCATTATA-3′ (GreB-R56D/R60D, PvuI). Four additional oligos corresponding to the 3′- and 5′-terminal portions of wt greA and wt greB with C-terminal His6 tag were also used as described previously (34.Koulich D. Orlova M. Malhotra A.

The resulting DNA fragments containing gre genes with a desirable mutation (or mutations) were inserted into either pTRC99A (GreA-37A, -52A, and -BPL) or PET-19b (GreA-LBP2, -LBP3, -LBP4, and all GreB mutants) vector using appropriate restriction sites (34.Koulich D.

The growth and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induction of the cells carrying derivatives of pTRC99A was performed as described (34.Koulich D. Orlova M. Malhotra A. Sali A. Darst S.A.

The cells transformed with PET-19b derivatives were grown and infected with phage λ (CE6) carrying phage T7 RNA polymerase gene according to the manufacturer's protocol (Novagen). The mutant GreA and GreB factors were purified to apparent homogeneity using the same purification scheme as described for wt GreA and His6-tagged wt GreB (49.Borukhov S. Goldfarb A.

Electrophoretically homogeneous Gre proteins were stored at 10 mg/ml in storage buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.8 mNaCl, 50% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol) at −20 °C.

The 6C-TEC was further purified by gel filtration on Quick-Spin G-50 column. The TEC carrying heptamer CpApCpCpApCpU (7U-TEC), nonamer CpApCpCpApCpUpGpA (9A-TEC), and arrested TECs carrying 12-meric and 13-meric transcripts CpApCpCpApCpUpGpApCpApC(pG) (12C/13G-TEC) were obtained as described (49.Borukhov S.

Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) by extension of 6C-TEC in the presence of UTP (3 μm), UTP+GTP+ATP (5 μm each) and four rNTPs (30 μm each), respectively, followed by purification on Quick-Spin G-50 column. The TEC carrying decamer CpApCpCpApCpUpGpApC (10C-TEC) was obtained by extension of purified 9A-TEC in the presence of 10 μm CTP (2.Borukhov S. Sagitov V. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1993; 72: 459-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). For the analysis of the type of cleavage activity of Gre factors, 9A- and 10C-TECs carrying radioactive phosphate at position +9 were prepared from unlabeled 6C-TEC (2.Borukhov S. Sagitov V. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1993; 72: 459-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). First, 6C-TEC was extended in the presence of 2 μm each of UTP + GTP + [α-32P]ATP (1500 Ci/mmol) yielding 9A-TEC, which was purified by Quick-Spin G-50 column. Then, the radiolabeled 9A-TEC was extended in the presence of 10 μmCTP yielding 10C-TEC. For determination of specific transcript cleavage activity of Gre mutants (as well as their antiarrest/readthrough activities), we used procedures that are described in our previous publications (1.Borukhov S.

Briefly, for each Gre protein, the specific cleavage activity was determined by measuring the percentage of cleavage of the initial 2.5 nm TEC after incubation with serial 3-fold dilutions of Gre factor in 10 μl of standard transcription buffer at 37 °C for 20 min (49.Borukhov S. Goldfarb A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The titration curves were made for each Gre protein, and the minimum amount of factor that causes 50% hydrolysis of RNA in the corresponding TEC was calculated. Similarly, for determination of specific readthrough activity, the initial radiolabeled 2.5 nm 6C-TEC was incubated in the presence of 100 μm NTPs with serial dilutions of Gre proteins as described above, and the minimum amount of factor that is required to decrease the formation of arrested 12C/13G-TECs by 50% was calculated (49.Borukhov S. Goldfarb A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).

ThegreA – /greB – E. coli cells (strain AD8571) transformed with pTRC99A, pDKA37A, pDKA52A, pDKABPL, pMO1.1, or pMO1.4His were grown at 30 °C in LB medium containing 150 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.3% glucose to an absorbance of 0.35 at 600 nm. Five 10-fold dilutions of each strain were made, and 5 μl of each sample were plated (in triplicate) on LB-agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and either 0.3% glucose or IPTG at various concentrations. The plates were incubated at 30 or 42 °C for 36 or 18 h, respectively.

By the insertion of this regulatory region into the γ subunit of thermophilic F1, we could confer the thiol modulation property to the thermophilic α3β3γ subcomplex.

No loss of thermostability compared with the wild type subcomplex was found, and activation by dithiothreitol was functional at temperatures up to 80 °C. α3β3γ(TCT) was inhibited by the ε subunit from chloroplast F1-ATPase but not by the one from the thermophilic F1-ATPase, indicating that the introduced amino acid residues from chloroplast F1-γ subunit are important for functional interaction with the ε subunit.

A high resolution x-ray structure of a major part of the bovine heart mitochondrial F1 revealed an alternating hexagonal arrangement of the three α and the three β subunits with two α-helices of the γ subunit forming a coiled-coil in the central cavity (8.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2752) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of an α3β3 complex from the thermophilicBacillus PS3 is completely symmetric (9.Shirakihara Y. Leslie A.G. Abrahams J.P. Walker J.E. Ueda T. Sekimoto Y. Kambara M. Saika K.

Rotation of the γ subunit relative to α3β3 had been suggested from kinetic analyses (11.Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys.

Finally, by a single molecular observation technique, rotation of the γ subunit during the ATP hydrolysis reaction in the α3β3 hexamer (14.Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K.

The molecular structure of the F0F1-ATP synthase of chloroplasts may be basically the same as those of other F0F1, but this enzyme has a unique regulation system. The activity of chloroplast F0F1 and F1 (CF1) is strongly regulated by the reduction and the oxidation of a disulfide bridge in the γ subunit formed between the two cysteines Cys199 and Cys205(spinach chloroplast) (18.Miki J. Maeda M. Mukohata Y. Futai M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 232: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar); this regulation system is called thiol modulation (19.Nalin C.M. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7275-7280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reduction of the disulfide bond elicits the latent ATP hydrolyzing activity of the isolated CF1. In vitro reduction can be achieved by dithiothreitol (DTT) or other dithiols, but the natural reductant is reduced thioredoxin-f(Trx-f) (20.Schwarz O. Schürmann P. Strotmann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16924-16927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 21.Stumpp M.T. Motohashi K. Hisabori T. Biochem.

Introduction of nine amino acids comprising the regulatory sequence into the cyanobacterial γ subunit induced thiol modulation in Synechocystis (23.Werner-Grune S. Gunkel D. Schümann J. Strotmann H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 24.Krenn B.E. Ardewijn P. Van Walraven H.S. Werner-Grüne S. Strotmann H. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 757-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Conversely, replacement of the two cysteines by serines in γ subunit of CF0CF1 from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (25.Ross S.A. Zhang M.X. Selman B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9813-9818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 26.Ross S.A. Zhang M.X. Selman B.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) resulted in a non-modulated enzyme. However, due to the lack of suitable overexpression systems for the subunits of CF1 and because of its insufficient ability for the reconstitution of the complete enzyme complex, little information is available about the details of this regulation mechanism. Recently we have succeeded in the reconstitution of a chimeric complex from recombinant α and β subunits of F1 of the thermophilicBacillus PS3 (TF1) and the recombinant γ subunit from spinach CF1 (27.Hisabori T. Kato Y. Motohashi K. Kroth-Pancic P. Strotmann H. Amano T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1158-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The resulting chimeric α3β3γ complex, which had substantial ATPase activity, was clearly regulated by the disulfide/dithiol state of the two regulatory cysteine residues. We could demonstrate the importance of the region around the disulfide bridge of γ subunit for the regulatory interaction with ε subunit which is known to inhibit activity (28.Hisabori T. Motohashi K. Kroth P. Strotmann H. Amano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15901-15905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, stability of this chimeric complex was still lower than that of wild type thermophilic α3β3γ, and large scale preparation was difficult. In order to understand the molecular mechanism of thiol regulation, we engineered a chimeric α3β3γ subcomplex of TF1 in which the central half of the γ subunit was replaced by the equivalent part of the γ subunit from CF1including the regulatory cysteines (Fig.1). The remaining parts derived from the TF1-γ subunit mainly consists of the N-terminal and C-terminal α-helices forming the coiled-coil and a small additional α-helix. The chimeric α3β3γ subcomplex was successfully overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified as an active ATPase. Then we investigated the enzymatic property of this complex under reduced and oxidized conditions. Restriction enzymes were purchased from Toyobo Co., Tokyo, Japan. DTT and MOPS were from Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan. TNP-ATP was synthesized and purified by the method as described (29.Hiratsuka A. Uchida K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 320: 635-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar,30.Grubmeyer C. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3718-3727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. Plasmid amplification was carried out with E. coli strain JM 109, and single-stranded uracil-containing DNA was obtained from E. coli strain CJ 236, and for protein overexpression E. coli strain JM 103 ΔuncB-D was used. A DNA fragment coding for α, γ (S106C), and β (carrying an N-terminal tag of 10 histidine residues) subunits of TF1 on the expression plasmid, pkkHisCys5 (14.Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 388: 299-302Crossref Scopus (1966) Google Scholar), was cloned into the multi-cloning site of the M13mp18 vector, and single-stranded uracil-containing DNA was obtained by the method of Ref. 31.Kunkel T.A. Bebenk K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar. The location for two silent mutations to constructNspV restriction sites was determined with the program MOTOJIMAN provided by Fumihiro Motojima, Tokyo Institute of Technology, and introduced by the method as described (31.Kunkel T.A. Bebenk K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) using the primers 5′-CACGAGGCGCAGCACGTTCGAATTGTACGCGCCAGC and 5′-TTCTTCTTGCGACGGTTCGAATTCGTACACCGTGCG. Then the DNA fragment coding the deduced γ subunit was cut out with the restriction enzymesNheI and BglII and cloned into the equivalent position between the genes for the α and β subunits on the pkkHisCys5 vector. A fragment of spinach chloroplast DNA coding for amino acid residues Leu96-Phe243 of the γ subunit of CF1 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction method using the phosphorylated primers 5′-CGGGATCCCGTTAGAAGTTGCTGAAGAAGGCTGAGTCTAGG and 5′-CGGGATCCCGTTCGAATTCCAGAATTGGGGAAAATGCTGG with the vector containing the gene for the γ subunit of spinach CF1 (27.Hisabori T. Kato Y. Motohashi K. Kroth-Pancic P. Strotmann H. Amano T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1158-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) as a template. The obtained DNA fragment was inserted by blunt-end ligation into pBluescript vector, which was previously digested withSmaI. Then the vector was digested with NspV to obtain a cohesive-end DNA fragment. Finally the above described pkkHisCys5 vector with two introduced NspV sites was digested with NspV and ligated with the cohesive-end DNA fragment to obtain the expression plasmid for α3β3γ(TCT) (pkkTCT vector). The correct orientation of the DNA fragment inserted into pkkTCT was confirmed by digestion with NheI and AflII. pkkTCT was transformed into E. coli JM 103 strain, cultivated on LB medium agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and then inoculated into the liquid culture. A 2-liter liquid culture in the same medium was harvested after 9 h cultivation. Cells were collected by centrifugation and disrupted by sonication. The supernatant was directly applied to a nickel-NTA (nitrilotriacetic acid) superflow column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) equilibrated with 50 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm imidazole. The column was washed with the same buffer containing 25 mmimidazole and then the enzyme was eluted with the same buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. The recombinant α3β3γ subcomplex of TF1 containing a histidine tag on the N terminus of the β subunit and the substitution of Ser106 of the γ subunit to Cys (α3β3γ (β-His, γS106C)) was expressed by using the pkkHisCys5 vector and purified by the method described (11.Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1098: 215-250Crossref Scopus (924) Google Scholar). ε subunit of TF1 was overexpressed in E. coli and isolated as described (32.Kato Y. Matsui T. Tanaka N. Muneyuki E. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24906-24912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The recombinant ε subunit of CF1 was expressed as an inclusion body and purified (27.Hisabori T. Kato Y. Motohashi K. Kroth-Pancic P. Strotmann H. Amano T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1158-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Prior to use, the folded ε subunit of CF1 was prepared as follows: the inclusion body was solved with 8 m urea, 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm DTT and dialyzed against 50 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.0, 100 mmKCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 for 6 h. Spinach chloroplast Trx-f was overexpressed in E. coli and isolated as described (21.Stumpp M.T. Motohashi K. Hisabori T. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The concentration of the purified Trx-fwas determined by the measurement of the absorbance at 278 nm using the published molar absorption coefficient value of 16,830m−1·cm−1 (33.Schürmann P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 274-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis activity was measured in the presence of an ATP regenerating system (34.Stiggal D.L. Galante Y.M. Hatefi Y. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) with a spectrophotometer model U-3100 (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a stirrer. The reaction mixture containing 50 mm MOPS-KOH, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 2 mm ATP, 50 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, 50 μg/ml lactate dehydrogenase, and 0.2 mm NADH was used. After a base line was monitored for 1–2 min, the reaction was initiated by the addition of 5–10 μg of α3β3γ(TCT), and the activity was measured by monitoring the decrease of NADH absorption at 340 nm at 25 °C. In the case where the ATP regenerating system was not applicable, the activity was measured by quantifying the amount of produced phosphate (35.Hisabori T. Muneyuki E. Odaka M. Yokoyama K. Mochizuki K. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4551-4556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 80 μl of 50 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.0, 100 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm ATP were incubated in a water bath for 2 min, and then the reaction was started by the addition of 20 μl (2 μg) of α3β3γ(TCT). After 2 min, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 100 μl of 2.4% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The reaction was carried out at 25 °C unless stated otherwise. α3β3γ(TCT) or α3β3γ (β-His, γS106C) were mixed with the ε subunit of CF1 or TF1 and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The mixture was then directly applied to the ATP hydrolysis assay using an ATP regenerating system as described above. α3β3γ(TCT)was oxidized with 50 μm CuCl2 or reduced with 15 mm DTT for 1 h at 30 °C. DTT in the sample was removed by an HPLC gel filtration column (TSK 3000SWXL, Tosoh Co., Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with 50 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2because DTT directly affected the following quantitative measurement of nucleotides. This step also reduced the amount of intrinsically bound nucleotides from 0.8 mol ADP/mol α3β3γ(TCT) to <0.1 mol ADP/mol α3β3γ(TCT). Each of the complexes was diluted to a protein concentration of 700 nm. A 50-μl aliquot was preincubated in a 25 °C water bath and then mixed with the same volume of 150 nm TNP-ATP. At the indicated period the reaction was terminated by addition of 5 μl of 24% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The amounts of TNP-ATP and TNP-ADP were determined by reversed-phase HPLC (35.Hisabori T. Muneyuki E. Odaka M. Yokoyama K. Mochizuki K. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4551-4556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In case of chase acceleration experiments, 10 μl of 100 μm ATP was added instead of trichloroacetic acid and incubated for further 10 s. Then the reaction was stopped by the addition of trichloroacetic acid as stated above. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS was performed according to Laemmli (36.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207180) Google Scholar). Protein bands were visualized by the staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. α3β3γ(TCT)was overexpressed in E. coli JM 103 and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The purity of the protein and the occurrence of the individual subunits in the complex were confirmed by SDS-gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2). The yield of α3β3γ(TCT) complex was about 80 mg of protein from a 2-liter E. coli culture, comparable to the yield of wild type α3β3γ (7.Matsui T. Yoshida M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) or α3β3γ (β-His, γS106C) (14.Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 388: 299-302Crossref Scopus (1966) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of the γ subunit in the α3β3γ(TCT) complex was about 35 kDa, clearly larger than the γ subunit of α3β3γ (β-His, γS106C) but very similar to the γ subunit of CF1 (Fig. 2), indicating the successful expression and the formation of the complex with the mutant γ subunit. The activity of ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by the purified α3β3γ(TCT) was measured spectrophotometrically by the pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase assay that provides continuous regeneration of ATP. Upon addition of oxidized and reduced α3β3γ(TCT) to the reaction mixture, ATP hydrolysis proceeded in a linear manner for at least 10 min without time-dependent inactivation (Fig.3 A), but the rates were different as follows: α3β3γ(TCT) was clearly activated by preincubation with DTT. When DTT alone was used for reduction, up to 2-fold activation was obtained (Fig. 3, Aand B). Activation was saturated at 15 mm DTT (Fig. 3 B). Extension of the preincubation time for more than 1 h did not significantly increase activation. Interestingly, the activation was higher if reduction was carried out with a combination of DTT and Trx-f (Fig. 3, A and B). When ATP hydrolysis reaction was initiated by addition of oxidized α3β3γ(TCT) and 15 mm DTT plus 500 nm Trx-f (final concentration) was added to the reaction mixture after 5 min, remarkable activation could be observed within several minutes (Fig.3 A, inset). The concentration of Trx-ffor half-maximal activation was about 200 nm (Fig.3 B, inset), considerably lower than that for authentic CF1, which was more than 1 μm (21.Stumpp M.T. Motohashi K. Hisabori T. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The specific activity of α3β3γ(TCT) in the oxidized state was 1.0–1.2 units/mg, and upon reduction with 15 mmDTT it increased to 2.2–2.6 units/mg, and with 15 mm DTT plus 500 nm Trx-f 3.0–3.3 units/mg were measured. Quantification of thiol groups indicated additional 1.6–1.9 mol of SH/mol of α3β3γ(TCT)after reduction with 15 mm DTT and additional 1.7–2.0 mol of SH/mol of α3β3γ(TCT) after reduction with 15 mm DTT plus 500 nmTrx-f. The specific activity of α3β3γ(TCT) in the fully reduced state under the reaction conditions above (pH 7.0) was comparable to that of α3β3γ (β-His, γS106C) under the same conditions (4.5 units/mg). The pH optimum was between 8.5 and 9.0, similar to the values reported for wild type α3β3γ (7.Matsui T. Yoshida M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), for TF1 (37.Yoshida M. Sone N. Hirata H. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7910-7916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and for CF1 (38.Sakurai H. Shinohara K. Hisabori T. Shinohara K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 90: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The optimum temperature of the ATPase activity of oxidized and reduced α3β3γ(TCT) was at 70 °C, the same as that of α3β3γ (β-His, γS106C) (Fig. 4) and comparable to the values reported for wild type TF1 and α3β3γ (7.Matsui T. Yoshida M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The ratio between the activities of oxidized and reduced α3β3γ(TCT) did not change significantly over the whole temperature range investigated. The effect of the inhibitory ε subunit of CF1 and that of TF1 on α3β3γ(TCT) was investigated (Fig. 5 A). ATPase activity of α3β3γ(TCT) in its oxidized state was inhibited to 50–60% by the ε subunit of CF1. Interestingly, α3β3γ(TCT) in its reduced state was nearly insensitive to the CF1-ε subunit, resulting in about a 4-fold higher activity compared with α3β3γ(TCT) in the oxidized state in the presence of the CF1-ε subunit. As reported previously, neither the CF1-ε subunit nor the TF1-ε subunit had any significant effect on the activity of α3β3γ (β-His, γS106C) when the ATP concentration was relatively high (32.Kato Y. Matsui T. Tanaka N. Muneyuki E. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24906-24912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, a slight but significant increase of activity was observed upon incubation of oxidized α3β3γ(TCT) with the TF1-ε subunit (Fig. 5 A). Again, this effect was less pronounced for α3β3γ(TCT) in the reduced form. To clarify the cause of the weakly stimulating effect of the ε subunit of TF1 on ATPase activity of α3β3γ(TCT), we examined its binding to the complex. After incubation with ε subunit of TF1, the complex was separated from unbound ε subunit by gel filtration HPLC. The α3β3γ(TCT) fraction was then applied to SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5 B). α3β3γ(TCT) in the oxidized state as well as in the reduced state could bind the ε subunit of TF1 in an approximately stoichiometric ratio, comparable to α3β3γ (β-His, γS106C) under identical conditions. When a substoichiometric molar ratio of TNP-ATP was added to the oxidized or reduced α3β3γ(TCT) complexes, the ATP analogue was slowly hydrolyzed. With both complexes it took 20 s to hydrolyze 50% of added TNP-ATP (Fig.6). An interesting difference was observed upon the addition of chase ATP. Whereas hydrolysis of TNP-ATP by reduced α3β3γ(TCT) was greatly accelerated by ATP, comparable to wild type α3β3γ (32.Kato Y. Matsui T. Tanaka N. Muneyuki E. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24906-24912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and α3β3γ (βI389C) (39.Tsunoda S.P. Muneyuki E. Amano T. Yoshida M. Noji H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5701-5706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), chase promotion was obviously lower in the case of the oxidized α3β3γ(TCT). In this study, an expression plasmid for an α3β3γ subcomplex of TF1containing a TF1/CF1 chimeric γ subunit (α3β3γ(TCT)) was constructed, and the desired protein complex was successfully overexpressed and purified with a yield comparable to those of wild type α3β3γ (7.Matsui T. Yoshida M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) or α3β3γ (β-His, γS106C) (14.Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 388: 299-302Crossref Scopus (1966) Google Scholar). This proves that combining two halves of γ subunits from different organisms and the insertion of additional amino acid residues from the γ subunit of CF1 into the central part of the γ subunit of TF1 are no major obstacles for biosynthesis and in vivo stability of this protein complex in the employed expression system. Thus, although the homology between the transferred part of CF1-γ subunit and the replaced part of the TF1-γ subunit was only about 15% on the amino acid level, proper folding of the γ subunit and insertion into the α3β3 hexagon appears to be unaffected. This is consistent with a recently published intermediate-resolution x-ray structure of E. coli F1, which indicated that four α-helices, thought to be comprised by the central amino acid residues of the γ subunit (roughly E. coli F1γ100–200, corresponding to residues 100–235 of γ(TCT)) are located at the tip of the enzyme and not in interaction with the α3β3 hexagon (40.Hausrath A.C. Gruber G. Matthews B.W. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13697-13702Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of the α3β3γ(TCT) complex was modulated by the reduction or oxidation of the two cysteines that were introduced by the insertion of the respective part of the CF1-γ subunit. An up to 3-fold activation could be observed by the complete reduction of these cysteines (Fig. 3). As this activation ratio is in the same range as that reported for CF1 (3–7-fold) (19.Nalin C.M. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7275-7280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Schwarz O. Schürmann P. Strotmann H. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), most likely the mechanism of thiol activation is the same in the α3β3γ(TCT) complex. Sokolovet al. (41.Sokolov M. Lu L.

Chem. 1999; 274: 13824-13829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) recently proposed that the conformation of the γ subunit of CF1 may be different from other F1-γ subunits. Their conclusion is based on former results of energy transfer measurements between γ subunit and the catalytic sites on β subunits (42.Moroney J.V. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8951-8955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Richter M.L. Snyder B. McCarty R.E. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5755-5763Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and their investigation of the ATPase activity of a complex formed from the isolated CF1α3β3 subcomplex and recombinant γ subunit of which the C terminus was partially deleted. In their model, the tip of the C terminus of the γ subunit does not act as a spindle for rotation. However, our results indicate that a bacterial γ subunit can be transformed into a functional chloroplast-like γ subunit. Thus the essential structural features and basic functions of both types of γ subunits should be the same. This is also consistent with previous reports that upon introduction of the chloroplast γ-like regulatory stretch into the γ subunit of cyanobacterial F1 conferred thiol modulation on this enzyme (23.Werner-Grune S. Gunkel D. Schümann J. Strotmann H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 24.Krenn B.E. Ardewijn P. Van Walraven H.S. Werner-Grüne S. Strotmann H. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 757-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In this mutant both ATP hydrolysis and ATP synthesis are controlled by thiol modulation. Furthermore, ATP hydrolysis activity of a reconstituted chimeric complex containing the α and β subunits of TF1, and the γ subunit of CF1(αT3βT3γC), was regulated by thiol modulation (27.Hisabori T. Kato Y. Motohashi K. Kroth-Pancic P. Strotmann H. Amano T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1158-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 28.Hisabori T. Motohashi K. Kroth P. Strotmann H. Amano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15901-15905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) although the complex showed reduced stability. Interestingly, a higher degree of activation of the complex α3β3γ(TCT) could be achieved with a mixture of DTT and Trx-f than with DTT alone (Fig.3 B), although we could not detect a significant difference in the amount of reduced thiol groups. This is consistent with our recently proposed model that a conformational change, which affects the enzyme activity, is induced by the interaction with Trx-f(21.Stumpp M.T. Motohashi K. Hisabori T. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The measurement of the temperature optimum of ATPase activity shows that α3β3γ(TCT), similar to α3β3γ (β-His, γS106C), is more stable than a chimeric αT3βT3γC, which displayed the highest activity at 55–60 °C (Fig. 4, compare with Fig. 2 of Ref. 27.Hisabori T. Kato Y. Motohashi K. Kroth-Pancic P. Strotmann H. Amano T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1158-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This result implies that the introduction of the 148 amino acid residues from a mesophilic enzyme does not affect thermostability of the complex significantly. The most probable explanation is that the interaction between the coiled-coil structure of γ subunit and the inner surface of the cavity of α3β3 hexagon is especially important for the stability of the complex. Although the homology of this coiled-coil region of the γ subunit is relatively high (27.Hisabori T. Kato Y. Motohashi K. Kroth-Pancic P. Strotmann H. Amano T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1158-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), some varying amino acid residues in the coiled-coil region might be very important for the stability of the complex. Activation by DTT was not affected by the temperature, so although thiol modulation in vivo usually occurs at temperatures <30 °C in plants, it is also functional at temperatures as high as 80 °C. The ε subunit is known to be an inhibitory subunit of F1-ATPases. It has been proposed that the C-terminal helical domain of the ε subunit is mainly responsible for the inhibitory function (44.Kuki M. Noumi T. Maeda M. Amemura A. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17437-17442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45.Xiong H. Zhang D. Vik S.B.

Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands1998: 1711-1714Google Scholar). As the ε subunit could be cross-linked to the β subunit (49.Dallmann H.G. Flynn T.G. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18953-18960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50.Aggeler R. Haughton M.A. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9185-9191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), the inhibition may be achieved by binding to the DELSEED region of the β subunit. We found that the ε subunit of CF1 can efficiently inhibit the ATPase activity of α3β3γ(TCT) but not that of α3β3γ (β-His, γS106C), although the α and β subunits are identical (Fig. 5). This induces the conclusion that an interaction of the ε subunit with the γ subunit may be more crucial for inhibition, possibly by providing proper binding and orientation of the ε subunit. As the sequence of the amino acid residues 92–239 of the γ subunit of α3β3γ(TCT) is different from α3β3γ (β-His, γS106C), it can be concluded that this region confers the sensitivity to inhibition by the ε subunit. Consistent with this finding, E. coliF1 residue γ106 and the region γ202–212 have previously been found to be involved in binding of the ε subunit by cross-linking and chemical labeling experiments (51.Tang C. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3018-3024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). E. coli F1-γ106 corresponds to γ(TCT)101, near the N-terminal part of the insertion from CF1, γ202–212 corresponds to γ(TCT) 234–244, located at the C terminus of the insertion (Fig. 1). Taken together, the part of the γ subunit that is of chloroplast origin in γ(TCT)appears to be crucial for binding of and inhibition by the ε subunit. As supposed from the suggested mechanism for the uni-site catalysis (29.Hiratsuka A. Uchida K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 320: 635-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 30.Grubmeyer C. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3718-3727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), no significant differences could be detected in the rate of uni-site hydrolysis by oxidized or by reduced α3β3γ(TCT). However, we found a difference in chase acceleration of hydrolysis of TNP-ATP by the addition of excess amounts of ATP (Fig. 6). The range of the chase acceleration for the reduced α3β3γ(TCT) was comparable to that published for TF1 (35.Hisabori T. Muneyuki E. Odaka M. Yokoyama K. Mochizuki K. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4551-4556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), wild type α3β3γ (32.Kato Y. Matsui T. Tanaka N. Muneyuki E. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24906-24912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and α3β3γ (βI389C) (39.Tsunoda S.P. Muneyuki E. Amano T. Yoshida M. Noji H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5701-5706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, significantly lower acceleration was observed for the oxidized α3β3γ(TCT), indicating an impaired interplay between the catalytic sites in the suppressed activity state caused by the formation of the disulfide bridge between Cys199 and Cys205 of the γ subunit. The regulation of the enzyme activity might be attributed to this difference observed at the chase acceleration level. The chimeric subcomplex α3β3γ(TCT) combines the property of thiol modulation, a unique feature of CF1-ATPase, with the stability and relative ease of genetic manipulation of the TF1-ATPase. It is therefore a very promising tool to investigate the structural basis and functional analyses of thiol modulation more in detail.

The parasite is spread between hosts by the tsetse fly vector and, in the bloodstream, possesses a dense surface coat of 10 million copies of variant surface glycoprotein (VSG)1 (1.Cross G.A.M. Parasitol. 1975; 71: 393-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 2.Cross G.A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The VSG coat protects the parasite from lysis by the alternative complement pathway. During an infection the parasite undergoes a process called antigenic variation whereby different VSGs are expressed on the plasma membrane (reviewed in Ref. 3.Cross G.A.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 83-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Regardless of which VSG variant is expressed on the surface, each VSG molecule is attached to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane by a conserved glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (4.Ferguson M.A.J. Homans S.W. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Science. 1988; 239: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The C-terminal amino acid of the VSG protein is attached, via an ethanolamine-phosphate bridge, to a conserved moiety of Manα1–2Manα1–6Manα1–4GlcN-myo-inositol-1-HPO4-3(sn-1,2-dimyristoylglycerol) (Man3GlcN-PI). The T. brucei GPI biosynthetic pathway was elucidated using a cell-free system containing washed trypanosome membranes (5.Masterson W.J. Doering T.L. Hart G.W. Englund P.T.

Chem. 1990; 265: 9033-9042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pathway involves assembly of ethanolamine-P-Man3GlcN-PI (glycolipid A′) from PI followed by fatty acid remodeling whereby both fatty acids of the PI moiety are remodeled to myristate (C14:0) through the sequential deacylation and reacylation of the glycerol backbone (Fig.1). The product, a dimyristoylated GPI known as glycolipid A (8.Masterson W.J. Raper J. Doering T.L. Hart G.W. Englund P.T.

Experiments using the cell-free system also showed that the donor for the myristoylation reactions of fatty acid remodeling was myristoyl-CoA (8.Masterson W.J. Raper J. Doering T.L. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. Cell. 1990; 62: 73-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In most, possibly all, eukaryotes it is known that acyl-CoAs are bound to acyl-CoA-binding proteins (ACBPs) that prevent their metabolism and allow the efficient shuttling of acyl-CoA to the cell acylation machinery (13.Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar).

Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Science. 1988; 239: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Studies using myristic acid analogs, such as O-11, suggest that their incorporation into the GPI anchor of VSG ultimately leads to the death of the parasites in culture (24.Doering T.L. Raper J.

Previous studies using trypanosome cell-free system experiments have shown that the donor of myristate for fatty acid remodeling (8.Masterson W.J. Raper J. Doering T.L. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. Cell. 1990; 62: 73-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and exchange (18.Buxbaum L.U. Raper J. Opperdoes F.R. Englund P.T. J. Biol.

However, other studies also suggested that the parasite was able to utilize myristoyl-lyso-phosphatidylcholine as a source of myristate (26.Samad A. Licht B. Stalmach M.E. Mellors A. Parasitol. Today. 1988; 5: 239-244Google Scholar, 27.Bowes A.E. Samad A.H. Jiang P. Weaver B. Mellors A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13885-13892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Werbovetz K.A. Bacchi C.J. Englund P.T. Mol. Biochem Parasitol. 1996; 81: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This has been further investigated, and it appears that myristoyl-lyso-phosphatidylcholine is converted to myristoyl-CoA, which can be subsequently used in the fatty acid remodeling reactions (29.Werbovetz K.A. Englund P.T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus, the consensus view is that myristoyl-CoA is the donor for myristic acid incorporation into trypanosome GPI anchors.Based on the work of Knudsen and others (13.Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 30.Rasmussen J.T. Rosendal J. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 31.Mandrup S.

Kristiansen K. Knudsen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22514-22521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), it is clear that the levels of free acyl-CoAs in the cytoplasm of most eukaryotic cells are very low because of the presence of ACBPs with high affinity for long chain acyl-CoAs. We wished to find the trypanosome ACBP homolog and to assess the effect of including this protein in the in vitro fatty acid remodeling assays. These assays use washed membrane preparations (the so-called cell-free system) that are likely to be devoid of endogenous (soluble) ACBP.We searched GenBankTM for potential trypanosome ACBP homologs with the gene encoding human ACBP and were able to detect a trypanosome EST sequence (accession No. W40086). We subsequently cloned the full-length genomic sequence, which showed significant similarity to other ACBP homologs (Fig. 2). However, sequence conservation was lower for the putative trypanosome ACBP than that previously observed between the other ACBP homologs (13.Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Previous studies identified 13 conserved amino acids found in all ACBP homologs and suggested that all of these residues might be necessary for binding acyl-CoAs (13.Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). In bovine ACBP these amino acids are Phe-5, Leu-15, Tyr-28, Lys-32, Gln-33, Gly-37, Pro-44, Lys-54, Trp-58, Gly-63, Ala-69, Tyr-73, and Leu-80. However, only six of those residues are absolutely conserved in trypanosome ACBP (Tyr-35, Gln-40, Gly-44, Pro-51, Lys-61, Ala-76) together with four conservative substitutions (Leu-6, Arg-65, Phe-80, Val-87) and three nonconservative substitutions (Thr-22, His-39, Lys-70). We considered that these differences from the other eukaryotic ACBPs studied to date might result in an altered specificity for binding acyl-CoAs. Having demonstrated that recombinant putative trypanosome ACBP was indeed a high affinity ACBP (Figs. 5 and 6), we tested the specificity of the trypanosome ACBP for acyl-CoA chain length using a competition assay (Fig. 7). These data showed that trypanosome ACBP had a distinct preference for shorter chain acyl-CoAs when compared directly to the bovine ACBP (Fig. 7).We utilized the previously resolved three-dimensional NMR structure of the complex between bovine ACBP and palmitoyl-CoA (33.Kragelund B.B.

D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This model predicts that the amino acids in the trypanosome ACBP at positions Thr-16, Lys-20, Ile-28, Lys-31, Leu-32, Tyr-35, Trp-38, Val-57, and Lys-61 are within 0.3 nm of the bound palmitoyl-CoA. Of these, Leu-32, Tyr-35, and Lys-61 are conserved; Lys-20 and Trp-38 are similar in bovine ACBP, whereas Thr-16, Ile-28, Lys-31, and Val-57 are not conserved between the two structures. These differences may have a role in defining the chain length specificity of the two ACBPs. We intend to investigate these issues using site-directed mutagenesis.Previous studies have investigated the binding affinity of acyl-CoAs for ACBP using epr spectroscopy (17.Rosendal J. Ertberg P.

Measurements made by direct titration microcalorimetry range from 2.4 × 10−7 and 1.7 × 10−8m for octanoyl-CoA and dodecanoyl-CoA with bovine ACBP (35.Rasmussen J.T. Faergeman N.J. Kristiansen K.

In our studies, we used equilibrium dialysis to directly measure theK d value of trypanosome ACBP for myristoyl-CoA and obtained a figure of 3.5 ± 0.4 × 10−10m (Fig. 6). This K d value is consistent with the generally high affinity of acyl-CoAs for ACBPs. We were unable to obtain an accurate K d value for bovine ACBP and myristoyl-CoA, which was out of the range of our assay and must have aK d value of < 1 × 10−10m. Previous titration studies showed that bovine ACBP has a preference for longer chain acyl-CoAs, with an optimal chain length of C18–20 (17.Rosendal J. Ertberg P. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 35.Rasmussen J.T. Faergeman N.J. Kristiansen K. Knudsen J. Biochem.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14118-14126Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The competition experiment (Fig. 7) is consistent with these data and show that whereas bovine ACBP has a relatively low affinity for shorter acyl-CoAs (<C12), the trypanosome homolog has a preference for shorter acyl-CoAs (<C20) and a remarkably high affinity for C10 and C12 acyl-CoAs.Finally, we investigated the effect of trypanosome ACBP on the trypanosome cell-free system that has previously been used to study GPI biosynthesis. We anticipated that we might observe an effect because the washed membranes of the cell free system should be depleted of endogenous ACBP, whereas in vivo the majority of cellular myristoyl-CoA would be bound to ACBP. Initially, we investigated the direct effect on fatty acid remodeling and/or fatty acid exchange by adding exogenous [3H]myristoyl-CoA ± ACBP to the cell-free system. This showed that the presence of trypanosome ACBP substantially enhanced the labeling of glycolipids A and C with [3H]myristate (Fig. 8 A). We then further investigated the effect of ACBP on fatty acid remodeling by prelabeling glycolipids A′ and θ in the cell-free system and subsequently generating myristoyl-CoA in situ by the addition of ATP and CoA. When ACBP was included, the efficiency of fatty acid remodeling and inositol-acylation was significantly increased. This strongly suggests that myristoyl-CoA is usually supplied to the fatty acid remodeling machinery via ACBP. This is consistent with the roles of ACBP in other eukaryotes where the ACBP is responsible for the transport of acyl-CoA directly to cell acylation machinery (22.Knudsen J. Faergeman N.J. Skott H.

Indeed, despite the limited similarity between the trypanosome and bovine ACBP, the latter seems to be able to supply myristoyl-CoA to the fatty acid remodeling machinery in the trypanosome cell-free system (Fig. 8 B). The protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei is responsible for causing African sleeping sickness in humans and Nagana in cattle. The parasite is spread between hosts by the tsetse fly vector and, in the bloodstream, possesses a dense surface coat of 10 million copies of variant surface glycoprotein (VSG)1 (1.Cross G.A.M. Parasitol. 1975; 71: 393-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 2.Cross G.A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The VSG coat protects the parasite from lysis by the alternative complement pathway. During an infection the parasite undergoes a process called antigenic variation whereby different VSGs are expressed on the plasma membrane (reviewed in Ref. 3.Cross G.A.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 83-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Regardless of which VSG variant is expressed on the surface, each VSG molecule is attached to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane by a conserved glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (4.Ferguson M.A.J. Homans S.W. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Science. 1988; 239: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The C-terminal amino acid of the VSG protein is attached, via an ethanolamine-phosphate bridge, to a conserved moiety of Manα1–2Manα1–6Manα1–4GlcN-myo-inositol-1-HPO4-3(sn-1,2-dimyristoylglycerol) (Man3GlcN-PI). The T. brucei GPI biosynthetic pathway was elucidated using a cell-free system containing washed trypanosome membranes (5.Masterson W.J. Doering T.L. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. Cell. 1989; 56: 793-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 6.Menon A.K. Schwarz R.T. Mayor S. Cross G.A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9033-9042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pathway involves assembly of ethanolamine-P-Man3GlcN-PI (glycolipid A′) from PI followed by fatty acid remodeling whereby both fatty acids of the PI moiety are remodeled to myristate (C14:0) through the sequential deacylation and reacylation of the glycerol backbone (Fig.1). The product, a dimyristoylated GPI known as glycolipid A (8.Masterson W.J. Raper J. Doering T.L. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. Cell. 1990; 62: 73-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), is linked to newly synthesized VSG in the endoplasmic reticulum by a transamidation reaction (10.Bangs J.D. Hereld D.

Experiments using the cell-free system also showed that the donor for the myristoylation reactions of fatty acid remodeling was myristoyl-CoA (8.Masterson W.J. Raper J. Doering T.L. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. Cell. 1990; 62: 73-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In most, possibly all, eukaryotes it is known that acyl-CoAs are bound to acyl-CoA-binding proteins (ACBPs) that prevent their metabolism and allow the efficient shuttling of acyl-CoA to the cell acylation machinery (13.Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). In this study we have expressed, purified, and characterized a recombinant trypanosome ACBP and studied the effect of this molecule on the fatty acid remodeling machinery of GPI biosynthesis. DISCUSSIONWe were interested in studying the fatty acid remodeling (8.Masterson W.J. Raper J. Doering T.L. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. Cell. 1990; 62: 73-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and fatty acid exchange reactions (18.Buxbaum L.U. Raper J. Opperdoes F.R. Englund P.T. J. Biol.

Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Science. 1988; 239: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Studies using myristic acid analogs, such as O-11, suggest that their incorporation into the GPI anchor of VSG ultimately leads to the death of the parasites in culture (24.Doering T.L. Raper J. Buxbaum L.U. Adams S.P. Gordon J.I. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. Science. 1991; 252: 1851-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 25.Doering T.L. Lu T. Werbovetz K.A. Gokel G.W. Hart G.W.

Previous studies using trypanosome cell-free system experiments have shown that the donor of myristate for fatty acid remodeling (8.Masterson W.J. Raper J. Doering T.L. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. Cell. 1990; 62: 73-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and exchange (18.Buxbaum L.U. Raper J. Opperdoes F.R. Englund P.T. J. Biol.

A. 1996; 93: 1178-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) is myristoyl-CoA. However, other studies also suggested that the parasite was able to utilize myristoyl-lyso-phosphatidylcholine as a source of myristate (26.Samad A. Licht B. Stalmach M.E. Mellors A. Parasitol. Today. 1988; 5: 239-244Google Scholar, 27.Bowes A.E. Samad A.H. Jiang P. Weaver B. Mellors A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13885-13892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Werbovetz K.A. Bacchi C.J. Englund P.T. Mol. Biochem Parasitol. 1996; 81: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This has been further investigated, and it appears that myristoyl-lyso-phosphatidylcholine is converted to myristoyl-CoA, which can be subsequently used in the fatty acid remodeling reactions (29.Werbovetz K.A. Englund P.T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus, the consensus view is that myristoyl-CoA is the donor for myristic acid incorporation into trypanosome GPI anchors.Based on the work of Knudsen and others (13.Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 30.Rasmussen J.T. Rosendal J. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 31.Mandrup S.

Kristiansen K. Knudsen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22514-22521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), it is clear that the levels of free acyl-CoAs in the cytoplasm of most eukaryotic cells are very low because of the presence of ACBPs with high affinity for long chain acyl-CoAs. We wished to find the trypanosome ACBP homolog and to assess the effect of including this protein in the in vitro fatty acid remodeling assays. These assays use washed membrane preparations (the so-called cell-free system) that are likely to be devoid of endogenous (soluble) ACBP.We searched GenBankTM for potential trypanosome ACBP homologs with the gene encoding human ACBP and were able to detect a trypanosome EST sequence (accession No. W40086). We subsequently cloned the full-length genomic sequence, which showed significant similarity to other ACBP homologs (Fig. 2). However, sequence conservation was lower for the putative trypanosome ACBP than that previously observed between the other ACBP homologs (13.Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Previous studies identified 13 conserved amino acids found in all ACBP homologs and suggested that all of these residues might be necessary for binding acyl-CoAs (13.Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). In bovine ACBP these amino acids are Phe-5, Leu-15, Tyr-28, Lys-32, Gln-33, Gly-37, Pro-44, Lys-54, Trp-58, Gly-63, Ala-69, Tyr-73, and Leu-80. However, only six of those residues are absolutely conserved in trypanosome ACBP (Tyr-35, Gln-40, Gly-44, Pro-51, Lys-61, Ala-76) together with four conservative substitutions (Leu-6, Arg-65, Phe-80, Val-87) and three nonconservative substitutions (Thr-22, His-39, Lys-70). We considered that these differences from the other eukaryotic ACBPs studied to date might result in an altered specificity for binding acyl-CoAs. Having demonstrated that recombinant putative trypanosome ACBP was indeed a high affinity ACBP (Figs. 5 and 6), we tested the specificity of the trypanosome ACBP for acyl-CoA chain length using a competition assay (Fig. 7). These data showed that trypanosome ACBP had a distinct preference for shorter chain acyl-CoAs when compared directly to the bovine ACBP (Fig. 7).We utilized the previously resolved three-dimensional NMR structure of the complex between bovine ACBP and palmitoyl-CoA (33.Kragelund B.B. Andersen K.V. Madsen J.C. Knudsen J. Poulsen F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1260-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) to predict the structure of trypanosome ACBP using the Collaborative Computational Project (34.Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This model predicts that the amino acids in the trypanosome ACBP at positions Thr-16, Lys-20, Ile-28, Lys-31, Leu-32, Tyr-35, Trp-38, Val-57, and Lys-61 are within 0.3 nm of the bound palmitoyl-CoA. Of these, Leu-32, Tyr-35, and Lys-61 are conserved; Lys-20 and Trp-38 are similar in bovine ACBP, whereas Thr-16, Ile-28, Lys-31, and Val-57 are not conserved between the two structures. These differences may have a role in defining the chain length specificity of the two ACBPs. We intend to investigate these issues using site-directed mutagenesis.Previous studies have investigated the binding affinity of acyl-CoAs for ACBP using epr spectroscopy (17.Rosendal J. Ertberg P.

Today. 1988; 5: 239-244Google Scholar, 27.Bowes A.E. Samad A.H. Jiang P. Weaver B. Mellors A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13885-13892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Werbovetz K.A. Bacchi C.J. Englund P.T. Mol. Biochem Parasitol. 1996; 81: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This has been further investigated, and it appears that myristoyl-lyso-phosphatidylcholine is converted to myristoyl-CoA, which can be subsequently used in the fatty acid remodeling reactions (29.Werbovetz K.A. Englund P.T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus, the consensus view is that myristoyl-CoA is the donor for myristic acid incorporation into trypanosome GPI anchors. Based on the work of Knudsen and others (13.Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 30.Rasmussen J.T. Rosendal J. Knudsen J. Biochem.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22514-22521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), it is clear that the levels of free acyl-CoAs in the cytoplasm of most eukaryotic cells are very low because of the presence of ACBPs with high affinity for long chain acyl-CoAs. We wished to find the trypanosome ACBP homolog and to assess the effect of including this protein in the in vitro fatty acid remodeling assays. These assays use washed membrane preparations (the so-called cell-free system) that are likely to be devoid of endogenous (soluble) ACBP. We searched GenBankTM for potential trypanosome ACBP homologs with the gene encoding human ACBP and were able to detect a trypanosome EST sequence (accession No. W40086). We subsequently cloned the full-length genomic sequence, which showed significant similarity to other ACBP homologs (Fig. 2). However, sequence conservation was lower for the putative trypanosome ACBP than that previously observed between the other ACBP homologs (13.Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Previous studies identified 13 conserved amino acids found in all ACBP homologs and suggested that all of these residues might be necessary for binding acyl-CoAs (13.Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). In bovine ACBP these amino acids are Phe-5, Leu-15, Tyr-28, Lys-32, Gln-33, Gly-37, Pro-44, Lys-54, Trp-58, Gly-63, Ala-69, Tyr-73, and Leu-80. However, only six of those residues are absolutely conserved in trypanosome ACBP (Tyr-35, Gln-40, Gly-44, Pro-51, Lys-61, Ala-76) together with four conservative substitutions (Leu-6, Arg-65, Phe-80, Val-87) and three nonconservative substitutions (Thr-22, His-39, Lys-70). We considered that these differences from the other eukaryotic ACBPs studied to date might result in an altered specificity for binding acyl-CoAs. Having demonstrated that recombinant putative trypanosome ACBP was indeed a high affinity ACBP (Figs. 5 and 6), we tested the specificity of the trypanosome ACBP for acyl-CoA chain length using a competition assay (Fig. 7). These data showed that trypanosome ACBP had a distinct preference for shorter chain acyl-CoAs when compared directly to the bovine ACBP (Fig. 7). We utilized the previously resolved three-dimensional NMR structure of the complex between bovine ACBP and palmitoyl-CoA (33.Kragelund B.B. Andersen K.V. Madsen J.C. Knudsen J. Poulsen F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1260-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) to predict the structure of trypanosome ACBP using the Collaborative Computational Project (34.Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This model predicts that the amino acids in the trypanosome ACBP at positions Thr-16, Lys-20, Ile-28, Lys-31, Leu-32, Tyr-35, Trp-38, Val-57, and Lys-61 are within 0.3 nm of the bound palmitoyl-CoA. Of these, Leu-32, Tyr-35, and Lys-61 are conserved; Lys-20 and Trp-38 are similar in bovine ACBP, whereas Thr-16, Ile-28, Lys-31, and Val-57 are not conserved between the two structures. These differences may have a role in defining the chain length specificity of the two ACBPs. We intend to investigate these issues using site-directed mutagenesis. Previous studies have investigated the binding affinity of acyl-CoAs for ACBP using epr spectroscopy (17.Rosendal J. Ertberg P. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and titration microcalorimetry (22.Knudsen J. Faergeman N.J. Skott H. Hummel R. Borsting C. Rose T.M. Andersen J.S. Hojrup P.

Measurements made by direct titration microcalorimetry range from 2.4 × 10−7 and 1.7 × 10−8m for octanoyl-CoA and dodecanoyl-CoA with bovine ACBP (35.Rasmussen J.T. Faergeman N.J. Kristiansen K. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 36.Faergeman N.J. Sigurskjold B.W. Kragelund B.B. Andersen K.V. Knudsen J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14118-14126Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) to 8.5 × 10−11m for palmitoyl-CoA with yeast ACBP (22.Knudsen J. Faergeman N.J. Skott H. Hummel R. Borsting C. Rose T.M. Andersen J.S. Hojrup P. Roepstorff P. Kristiansen K. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In our studies, we used equilibrium dialysis to directly measure theK d value of trypanosome ACBP for myristoyl-CoA and obtained a figure of 3.5 ± 0.4 × 10−10m (Fig. 6). This K d value is consistent with the generally high affinity of acyl-CoAs for ACBPs. We were unable to obtain an accurate K d value for bovine ACBP and myristoyl-CoA, which was out of the range of our assay and must have aK d value of < 1 × 10−10m. Previous titration studies showed that bovine ACBP has a preference for longer chain acyl-CoAs, with an optimal chain length of C18–20 (17.Rosendal J. Ertberg P. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 35.Rasmussen J.T. Faergeman N.J. Kristiansen K. Knudsen J. Biochem.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14118-14126Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The competition experiment (Fig. 7) is consistent with these data and show that whereas bovine ACBP has a relatively low affinity for shorter acyl-CoAs (<C12), the trypanosome homolog has a preference for shorter acyl-CoAs (<C20) and a remarkably high affinity for C10 and C12 acyl-CoAs. Finally, we investigated the effect of trypanosome ACBP on the trypanosome cell-free system that has previously been used to study GPI biosynthesis. We anticipated that we might observe an effect because the washed membranes of the cell free system should be depleted of endogenous ACBP, whereas in vivo the majority of cellular myristoyl-CoA would be bound to ACBP. Initially, we investigated the direct effect on fatty acid remodeling and/or fatty acid exchange by adding exogenous [3H]myristoyl-CoA ± ACBP to the cell-free system. This showed that the presence of trypanosome ACBP substantially enhanced the labeling of glycolipids A and C with [3H]myristate (Fig. 8 A). We then further investigated the effect of ACBP on fatty acid remodeling by prelabeling glycolipids A′ and θ in the cell-free system and subsequently generating myristoyl-CoA in situ by the addition of ATP and CoA. When ACBP was included, the efficiency of fatty acid remodeling and inositol-acylation was significantly increased. This strongly suggests that myristoyl-CoA is usually supplied to the fatty acid remodeling machinery via ACBP. This is consistent with the roles of ACBP in other eukaryotes where the ACBP is responsible for the transport of acyl-CoA directly to cell acylation machinery (22.Knudsen J. Faergeman N.J. Skott H.

The oxidation of water occurs at the lumenal surface of the thylakoid membrane through the stepwise oxidation of a manganese cluster, (Mn)4, which forms the catalytic core of the oxygen evolving enzyme (see reviews, see Refs. 1.Debus R.J.

PSII water oxidation requires both calcium and chloride ions, and although the calcium requirement has been intensively studied, insight regarding the number of Ca2+ sites and the precise role of Ca2+ in the photosynthetic oxidation of water remains murky (for review, see Refs. 1.Debus R.J.

It is known that the absence of Ca2+ in PSII inhibits proper photochemical function preventing oxygen evolution, and it is now becoming clear that one Ca2+-binding site is associated with these calcium-depleted effects (1.Debus R.J.

The marked effects which the removal of Ca2+ has on the functioning of the oxygen evolving enzyme strongly suggest that this Ca2+ site is located in the reaction center core of PSII (5.Han K.-C. Katoh S. Plant Cell Physiol. 1993; 34: 585-593Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis studies have allowed suggestions concerning the location of the Ca2+-binding site in the PSII reaction center core (9.Chu H.A. Nguyen A.P. Debus R.J.

Photosystem II possesses a second Ca2+-binding site not directly related to oxygen evolution (5.Han K.-C. Katoh S. Plant Cell Physiol. 1993; 34: 585-593Google Scholar, 11.Shen J.-R. Satoh K. Katoh S.

This second Ca2+ ion is very tightly bound and appears to be associated with a light-harvesting protein (5.Han K.-C. Katoh S. Plant Cell Physiol. 1993; 34: 585-593Google Scholar, 12.Irrgang K.-D Renger G. Vater J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 13.Davis D.J. Gross E.L.

There are conflicting reports as to which of the light-harvesting proteins the strongly bound Ca2+ is associated. Irrgang and co-workers (12.Irrgang K.-D Renger G. Vater J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) have characterized the strong Ca2+-binding properties of a 30-kDa Chl a/b protein and reported its implication as being a Ca2+-binding protein. This 30-kDa protein is most likely CP29 (see Ref. 15.Jansson S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1184: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). CP29 is the largest of the so-called “minor” light harvesting complex (LHC) proteins of PSII and consists of approximately 257 amino acids. Various data indicate that the protein binds 6 Chl a, 2 Chl b, and 2 xanthophyll molecules (16.Bassi R. Pineau B. Dainese P. Marquardt J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 17.Giuffra E. Zuchelli G. Sandonà D. Croce R. Cugini D. Garlaschi F.M. Bassi R. Jennings R.C.

Acta. 1998; 1365: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). CP29 is situated between the major LHCII complex and the PSII core and is thought to play a role in the regulation of the concentration of the Chl a excited states (16.Bassi R. Pineau B. Dainese P. Marquardt J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 19.Walters R.G. Ruban A.V. Horton P. Eur. J.

CP29 also undergoes reversible phosphorylation under photoinhibitory conditions (21.Bergantino E. Dainese P. Cerovic Z. Sechi S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8474-8481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It seems then that CP29 probably plays important roles in photoregulation in PSII. In this contribution, we identify a specific Ca2+-binding site in the CP29 polypeptide of maize PSII. CP29 was reconstituted with the lanthanide Yb3+ and the metal-binding site in CP29 was characterized using near-infrared Yb3+ vibronic side band (VSB) fluorescence spectroscopy (22.Roselli C. Boussac A. Mattioli T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12897-12901Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 23.Roselli C. Boussac A. Mattioli T.A. Griffiths J.A. El-Sayed M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14333-14337Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In this technique, we exploit the well known phenomenon of the specific replacement of Ca2+ in proteins with trivalent lanthanide metal ions (24.Horrocks Jr., W.de W. Adv. Inorg. Biochem. 1982; 4: 201-261Google Scholar,25.Evans C.H. Freiden E. Biochemistry of the Lanthanides. Plenum Press, New York1990Crossref Google Scholar). After Ca2+ is replaced selectively with Yb3+, then the fluorescence spectrum of Yb3+ in the Ca2+ site is recorded and analyzed. When coordinated, the Yb3+ fluorescence spectrum exhibits two characteristic types of features: 1) a sharp 4f-4f electronic feature called the zero phonon line (ZPL) that corresponds to the Yb3+ 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 electronic transition, and, 2) weak VSBs shifted to longer wavelengths with respect to the ZPL. These VSBs are the result of short-range dipole-dipole interactions that couple the ZPL electronic transition dipole of Yb3+ with the dipoles of the vibrational modes of its ligands. These VSBs reflect the vibrational modes of the Yb3+ ligands: the spectral energy difference between the ZPL and the various VSBs correspond to vibrational energies (or frequencies) of the corresponding ligand vibrational modes. VSBs, in fact, provide a specific and selective vibrational spectrum of the ligands and only the ligands defining the binding site of Yb3+ in the protein (see Refs. 22.Roselli C. Boussac A. Mattioli T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12897-12901Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar and 23.Roselli C. Boussac A. Mattioli T.A. Griffiths J.A. El-Sayed M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14333-14337Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar and references therein). As with Raman or infrared vibrational spectra, Yb3+ VSB “fingerprint” spectra can be used to identify the chemical nature of the metal binding ligands. Since inspection of the primary sequence of CP29 (26.Pesaresi P. Sandonà D. Giuffra E. Bassi R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) does not reveal an obvious Ca2+-binding site such as a classic EF-type motif, the vibrational information obtained from the Yb3+ VSB spectra provides valuable information concerning the chemical nature of the binding site of Yb3+ reconstituted into the Ca2+-binding site in CP29, and a plausible location may be proposed. Native CP29 and LHCII were purified from maize PSII membranes as described previously (27.Dainese P. Hoyer-Hansen G. Bassi R. Photochem. Photobiol. 1990; 51: 693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Dainese P. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8136-8142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) with a dot blot apparatus (Bio-Rad) (CP29 = 1.6 μg of Chl; LHCII = 1.7 μg of Chl; calsequestrin = 3.8 μg of protein). Detection of 45Ca2+ binding was performed essentially as in Ref. 29.Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. 1984; 95: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar in the presence of 10 μCi of45CaCl2 and 2 μmCaCl2 for 20 min at pH 7.5; nitrocellulose was then washed 3 times for 2 min with 10 ml of 30% ethanol. Radioactivity was detected with a Instant Imager, Packard. The proteins were probed for the binding of45Ca2+ either in the presence or absence of DCCD (dissolved in ethanol). Control proteins were treated with the same volume of ethanol utilized for DCCD treatment (< 1.5% of the final volume) and incubated 10 min at room temperature. Calsequestrin from rabbit muscle was used as positive control. All further procedures used plastic tubes to avoid contamination from other cations, and media made from deionized water (Elgastat Maxima, Elga Ltd., Bucks, United Kingdom; resistivity 18 MΩ), and passed through a Chelex 100 (Bio-Rad) column. Fresh stock solutions of Yb3+ were prepared just before use from chloride crystals (YbCl3·6H2O, Aldrich) kept in a dessicator. The buffers used, i.e. HEPES, MES, and acetate, are known to be poor or weak lanthanide coordinators (25.Evans C.H. Freiden E. Biochemistry of the Lanthanides. Plenum Press, New York1990Crossref Google Scholar). The reconstitution of Yb3+ into CP29 was performed on initial solutions of 1.85 mm CP29 in “Solution A” (0.03% dodecyl-β-maltoside (β-DM), 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.1 m sucrose); all steps were performed at 4 °C in dim light. The CP29 protein solution was first diluted to 0.075 mm in 0.03% β-DM, 20 mm MES, 0.1m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA all at pH 4.4. Similar pH conditions were found for the deionization procedure for the removal of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions in bacteriorhodopsin (23.Roselli C. Boussac A. Mattioli T.A. Griffiths J.A. El-Sayed M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14333-14337Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The resulting solution was then centrifuged in a Centricon 30 microconcentrator (Amicon) to remove the aqueous buffer. UV-visible absorption spectroscopy (Shimadzu UV-160) was used after every centrifugation step to verify no chlorophyll or carotenoid molecules were present in the wash. The CP29 protein was then re-diluted in a solution containing 0.03% β-DM, 0.1 m sucrose, 20 mm MES, pH 6.6, and 0.5 mm Yb3+, representing a Yb3+:CP29 ratio of approximately 10:1, and this solution was allowed to incubate overnight on ice in the dark. This Yb3+-containing solution was then exchanged for the original Solution A by washing several times with Solution A using the Centricon 30 microconcentrators; again, UV-visible absorption spectrophotometry was used to verify no loss of protein or spectral changes in the native and Yb3+-treated CP29. The Yb3+ content of the resulting CP29 protein, and after several consecutive washings in Solution A using the microconcentrators, was determined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry (Perkin-Elmer 2280) using the carefully determined linear relation observed for Yb3+ standard solutions. Low temperature (15 K) near infrared Yb3+ vibronic side band spectra of Yb3+-reconstituted CP29 were obtained as described in Roselli et al. (22.Roselli C. Boussac A. Mattioli T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12897-12901Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 23.Roselli C. Boussac A. Mattioli T.A. Griffiths J.A. El-Sayed M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14333-14337Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Near-infrared light used for exciting the Yb3+ fluorescence was provided by a Ti4+:sapphire laser (Spectra Physics 3900 S) pumped by a continuous wave Ar+ laser (Coherent Innova 100) operating in the “all-lines” mode. Laser power at the sample was about 100 mW. Yb3+ near-infrared fluorescence was detected using a modified Bruker IFS 66 Fourier transform interferometer equipped with a Bruker FRA 100 Raman module as described by Roselli et al. (22.Roselli C. Boussac A. Mattioli T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12897-12901Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 23.Roselli C. Boussac A. Mattioli T.A. Griffiths J.A. El-Sayed M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14333-14337Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Samples were held in an optical cold helium gas-flow cryostat (TBT-SMC, Grenoble, France). CP29 protein samples in D2O were prepared by repeated cycles of solution exchanges with D2O, 10 mm HEPES buffer, pD 8.0, containing 0.03% β-DM and 0.1 m sucrose using Centricon 30 concentrators; D2O solutions are used as a precaution in Yb3+ VSB spectroscopy to avoid lanthanide fluorescence quenching often observed in H2O (25.Evans C.H. Freiden E. Biochemistry of the Lanthanides. Plenum Press, New York1990Crossref Google Scholar). Spectral baseline correction, Fourier deconvolution, and second-derivative analyses were performed using the GRAMS 32 software package (Galactic Industries, Salem, NH). We have studied the binding of calcium to the minor antenna protein CP29 and to the major LHCII polypeptide. The dot blot analysis of purified CP29 and LHCII proteins (Fig. 1) demonstrates that CP29 is a calcium-binding polypeptide whereas LHCII did not show any significant binding (position B2 and B1, respectively, in Fig. 1). It should be pointed out that a weak signal is also present in the control LHCII protein, this signal was attributed to small contamination of minor antenna proteins (CP26 and CP29) in this preparation as confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis (not shown). Fig. 1 also shows that DCCD prevented 45Ca2+binding to CP29 (position A2). This is in agreement with previous observations that radioactive calcium was specifically bound by unidentified PSII antenna proteins rather than by PSII core proteins and was displaced by DCCD (14.Webber A.N. Gray J.C. FEBS Lett. 1989; 249: 79-82Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Yb3+ can be reconstituted into CP29 by first lowering the pH to 4.4, washing, and then incubating CP29 in a 10-fold excess of Yb3+ in a buffered solution at pH 6.6. Excess Yb3+ ions, and those that were weakly bound, were removed by simple washing with Solution A with no chelator present. Fig.2 shows the number of Yb3+atoms per CP29, determined using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry, as a function of the number of washing steps after Yb3+ reconstitution. This figure clearly shows that after only two washing steps, essentially all of the excess, and nonspecifically bound, Yb3+ is removed from CP29, resulting in the stoichiometric (1:1) binding of Yb3+ to the protein. These conditions for Yb3+ reconstitution procedure were determined after preliminary studies at higher pH. Fig.3 shows the Yb3+ fluorescence spectrum of the Yb3+-reconstituted CP29 protein (Yb3+-CP29) in the zero phonon line (or low frequency) region as compared with those of Yb3+ in the buffer/β-dodecyl maltoside D2O solution (Yb3+-β-DM) and Yb3+ in buffer/D2O solution (Yb3+-D2O) (see legend in Fig. 3 for details). The fluorescence spectra in Fig. 3 are plotted in terms of absolute energy expressed in wavenumbers (cm−1); the zero phonon lines are denoted “ZPL” and their absolute energies are indicated (10,236, 10,270, and 10,277 cm−1 for Yb3+-CP29, Yb3+-β-DM, and Yb3+-D2O, respectively). The vibronic side bands observed at lower energies are indicated as the shift (in cm−1) relative to the ZPLs (0 cm−1). Fig. 3clearly shows that the Yb3+ VSB spectra of these different Yb3+ complexes (i.e. Yb3+-CP29, Yb3+-β-DM, and Yb3+-buffer/D2O) are all distinctly different. These different VSB spectra permit us to arrive at specific conclusions concerning the Yb3+-CP29 complex. The VSB spectrum of Yb3+ complexed with D2O is relatively strong and exhibits distinct characteristic VSB bands at 41, 193, 289, 369, and 454 cm−1 in the low frequency region. In comparing the low frequency VSB spectra of the Yb3+-D2O and Yb3+-CP29 complex shown in Fig. 3 it is clear that the Yb3+ ion in CP29 is in a quite different coordination environment with few or no water molecules as ligands. In addition, comparison of the Yb3+-CP29 and Yb3+-β-DM low frequency VSB spectra indicates that we have no interference from possible Yb3+-detergent complex artifacts in the Yb3+-CP29 VSB spectrum (this point will be discussed further below). The low frequency VSB spectrum of Yb3+-reconstituted CP29 shown in Fig. 3 allows us to determine the ZPL of Yb3+ in CP29 along with some low-frequency ligand vibrational modes of the Yb3+ ligands, however, these low frequency modes are not as distinctive as higher frequency vibrational modes which serve as “vibrational fingerprints” of the ligands coordinated with Yb3+ in CP29. Fig. 4 shows the Yb3+ VSB spectra of Yb3+-CP29, in the high frequency region, recorded using several excitation wavelengths. The VSBs are readily identified by their invariance in energy as the excitation wavelength is changed while, in contrast, Raman bands follow the change in excitation wavelength. Observed Raman bands in Fig. 4 are designated by “R”; with respect to the excitation wavelength, these clusters of Raman bands correspond to vibrational frequencies at about 2028–2414–2474 cm−1 (in Raman shift) and can be attributed to the D2O ice in the samples. In contrast, there are three distinct bands in Fig. 4 at about 8900–8650 cm−1 (on the absolute energy scale) that do not shift as the excitation wavelength is changed and can be thus confidently assigned to vibronic side bands of the Yb3+ in CP29. These three distinct VSB bands in Fig. 4 are seen at 1,314, 1,397, and 1,597 cm−1, as calculated from the shift of the ZPL of the Yb3+-CP29 complex observed at 10,236 cm−1(Fig. 3). We also note that these VSBs are unique to the Yb3+-CP29 complex and are not observed for the Yb3+·β-dodecylmaltoside complex (Fig. 4) nor for the Yb3+·D2O complex (data not shown). Furthermore, at these wavelengths of excitation we could not detect any interference from any Raman contributions from either the protein or its chlorophyll/carotenoid pigments in the VSB spectral region studied. As with any fluorescence phenomena, the intensity of the fluorescence band is excitation wavelength dependent. We have analyzed the behavior of the VSB bands as a function of excitation energy. Fig.5 shows the variation in intensity of the ZPL, two low frequency VSBs, as well as the relatively intense 1397 and 1597 cm−1 VSBs, in the high frequency region, of Yb3+ in CP29, as a function of excitation wavelength. The intense, sharp 2028 cm−1 Raman band of the D2O ice (denoted R in Fig. 4) was used as an internal intensity standard. As expected, the intensities of the two VSBs vary as the excitation wavelength is changed but more importantly, the trends of the VSBs are all the same. In addition, in the low frequency region, the 399 cm−1 VSB and the two unresolved 146 and 200 cm−1 VSBs follow the same trend as the ZPL; for these two latter bands, the intensity was monitored near the center frequency of 170 cm−1. In the high frequency region, 2For technical reasons related to the spectral characteristics of the laser-rejection filters used in our apparatus, we are unable to observe the ZPL line when measuring the high frequency VSBs. Consequently, the VSB data are depicted separately in the low frequency and the high frequency VSB spectral ranges. the 1397 and 1597 cm−1 VSBs exhibit similar trends as the wavelength of excitation is changed and indicate the same maximum at about 960 nm. If these two VSB bands were originating from two or more spectroscopically different Yb3+ sites, then it is expected that their excitation wavelength-dependent behavior would be different and would manifest this difference by variation in the trends of the VSB bands. The Yb3+ VSB technique is very sensitive to this type of behavior, as we have previously reported (23.Roselli C. Boussac A. Mattioli T.A. Griffiths J.A. El-Sayed M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14333-14337Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 30.Roselli C. Burie J.-R. Mattioli T.A. Boussac A. Biospectroscopy. 1995; 1: 329-339Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The lack of differences in the observed VSB intensities as a function of excitation wavelength as seen in Fig. 5 indicates that the population of Yb3+ ions detected in CP29 protein is spectroscopically homogenous. We note that Yb3+ VSB spectroscopy is a very sensitive technique and can distinguish energy differences in Yb3+-binding sites as small as 15 cm−1(30.Roselli C. Burie J.-R. Mattioli T.A. Boussac A. Biospectroscopy. 1995; 1: 329-339Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows the unsmoothed average of eight high frequency VSB spectra of Yb3+ in CP29. For clarity of presentation, a baseline correction has been performed. In addition to the prominent VSBs observed at 1314, 1397, and 1597 cm−1, we have performed Fourier deconvolution and second-derivative analyses (not shown) to accurately determine the frequencies of unresolved shoulders seen at 1433, 1533, and 1623 cm−1 in the VSB spectrum. We note that the comparison of the Fourier deconvolution and second-derivative spectra were both in agreement in identifying spectral components at 1433, 1533, and 1623 cm−1. The Yb3+ VSB spectrum shown in Fig. 6 is similar to that of Yb3+ reconstituted into the Ca2+-binding site of rabbit muscle parvalbumin (22.Roselli C. Boussac A. Mattioli T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12897-12901Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and of other complexes of Yb3+ predominantly bound by carboxylic groups (22.Roselli C. Boussac A. Mattioli T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12897-12901Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 23.Roselli C. Boussac A. Mattioli T.A. Griffiths J.A. El-Sayed M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The VSB spectrum in Fig. 6 unambiguously indicates that the majority of the ligands of Yb3+ bound in CP29 are carboxylic acids, as would be expected for a Ca2+-binding site. Details of the spectrum and band assignments will be discussed below. It is well established that lanthanides readily substitute and strongly bind in protein Ca2+-binding sites (22.Roselli C. Boussac A. Mattioli T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12897-12901Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 23.Roselli C. Boussac A. Mattioli T.A. Griffiths J.A. El-Sayed M. Proc. Natl.

Trivalent lanthanides have ionic radii (32.Shannon R.D. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1976; 32: 751-767Crossref Scopus (52148) Google Scholar) which are comparable to that of Ca2+(about 1 Å). Like Ca2+, lanthanide bonding is essentially ionic (25.Evans C.H. Freiden E. Biochemistry of the Lanthanides. Plenum Press, New York1990Crossref Google Scholar). Crystallographic, spectroscopic, and chemical data indicate that the most common ligand atoms of Ca2+-binding sites in biological systems are oxygen atoms (33.Einspahr H. Bugg C.E. Sigel H. Metals in Biological Systems. 17. Marcel Dekker, New York1984: 51-97Google Scholar, 34.MacPhalen C.A. Strynadka N.C.J. James M.N.G. Adv.

Similarly, lanthanides exhibit a strong preference for ligands providing oxygen donor atoms (25.Evans C.H. Freiden E. Biochemistry of the Lanthanides. Plenum Press, New York1990Crossref Google Scholar). Lanthanides have been used extensively to probe Ca2+-binding sites in proteins (reviewed in Refs. 25.Evans C.H. Freiden E.

Methods Enzymology. 1993; 226: 495-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and x-ray crystallographic protein structures provide strong evidence for the isomorphous replacement of Ca2+ by trivalent lanthanides (25.Evans C.H. Freiden E. Biochemistry of the Lanthanides. Plenum Press, New York1990Crossref Google Scholar, 36.Horrocks Jr., W., de W. Methods Enzymology. 1993; 226: 495-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Several structures suggest that it is quite generally possible to replace Ca2+ by Ln3+ with minimal disruption to the binding site or the overall structure of the protein. It should be expected, however, that the Ca2+ to Ln3+ substitution could increase the co-ordination number by one (36.Horrocks Jr., W., de W. Methods Enzymology. 1993; 226: 495-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), as has been observed in one Ca2+ site of carp parvalbumin which was substituted with Yb3+ (37.Kumar V.D. Lee L. E"
https://openalex.org/W2003971289,"Gi protein-coupled receptors such as the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) and A1 adenosine receptor have been shown to activate G protein-activated inwardlyrectifying K+ channels (GIRKs) via pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins in atrial myocytes and in many neuronal cells. Here we show that muscarinic M2 receptors not only activate but also reversibly inhibit these K+currents when stimulated with agonist for up to 2 min. The M2 mAChR-mediated inhibition of the channel was also observed when the channels were first activated by inclusion of guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) in the pipette. Under these conditions the M2 mAChR-induced inhibition was quasi-irreversible, suggesting a role for G proteins in the inhibitory process. In contrast, when GIRK currents were maximally activated by co-expressing exogenous Gβγ, the extent of acetylcholine (ACh)-induced inhibition was significantly reduced, suggesting competition between the receptor-mediated inhibition and the large pool of available Gβγ subunits. The signaling pathway that led to the ACh-induced inhibition of GIRK channels was unaffected by pertussis toxin pretreatment. Furthermore, the internalization and agonist-induced phosphorylation of M2 mAChR was not required because a phosphorylation- and internalization-deficient mutant of the M2 mAChR was as potent as the wild-type counterpart. Pharmacological agents modulating various protein kinases or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase did not affect the inhibition of GIRK currents. Furthermore, the signaling pathway that mediates GIRK current inhibition was found to be membrane-delimited because bath application of ACh did not inhibit GIRK channel activity in cell-attached patches. Other G protein-coupled receptors including M4 mAChR and α1A adrenergic receptors also caused the inhibition, whereas other G protein-coupled receptors including A1 and A3 adenosine receptors and α2A and α2C adrenergic receptors could not induce the inhibition. The presented results suggest the existence of a novel signaling pathway that can be activated selectively by M2 and M4 mAChR but not by adenosine receptors and that involves non-pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins leading to an inhibition of Gβγ-activated GIRK currents in a membrane-delimited fashion.

Fong T.M. Graziano M.P. Tota M.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), which in turn cause activation of downstream effectors. When a cell receives multiple signals that are transduced through different GPCRs, the integration of multiple signaling events is complex not only because of the fact that the G proteins have multiple effector systems but also because of “cross-talk” between signaling pathways. Recently, evidence has emerged that cross-talk between GPCRs not only can occur between pathways that utilize different classes of G proteins but also within one G protein family (2.Polo-Parada L. Pilar G. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5213-5227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The current study presents a new case of cross-talk between signals that are produced by activation of adenosine and muscarinic receptors that are known to couple to the same class of G proteins. The initial goal of this study was to investigate the regulation and the desensitization of M2 mAChR- and A1adenosine receptor-activated K+ channels that give rise to the current known as IKACh. IKACh channels were first identified in the supraventricular tissue of the heart, and their regulation by M2 mAChRs and other GPCRs, such as the A1 adenosine or lysosphingolipid receptors, has been the topic of many different studies over the past two decades (3.Sakmann B.

IKACh channels were characterized as Gprotein-activated inwardly rectifyingK+ channels (GIRKs) that are activated by pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G proteins in a membrane-delimited fashion (3.Sakmann B.

Desensitization of GPCR-activated GIRK currents has been observed in native tissues and in heterologous expression systems. We have utilized the GIRK channels as a readout system to study desensitization of G protein-mediated signals for two reasons. First, electrophysiological recording of GIRK currents with the patch clamp technique allows for real time measurement of G protein-mediated signals in intact cells. Second, the GIRK channels conduct potassium ions, which diffuse very rapidly, and the concentration of K+ can be controlled; therefore, even after activation of GIRK channels for a long period of time, depletion of intra- or extracellular K+ does not occur, and hence desensitization at the level of the channels does not play a major role in desensitization events. Desensitization of GPCR-generated signals can be homologous, where only the stimulated GPCR desensitizes, or heterologous, where the signaling by heterologous GPCRs is inhibited. To distinguish between homologous and heterologous desensitization processes, two different Gi-coupled receptors (A1 adenosine and M2 mAChR) were co-transfected into HEK293 cells with GIRK1 and GIRK4. Before and after an initial treatment of one of these receptors with agonist, the response to stimulation of the other receptor was determined. If the response of the treated receptor only was reduced after the initial treatment with agonist, this was considered homologous desensitization. However, if there was a reduction of the response of the untreated receptor after an initial treatment of the other receptor, this was considered to reflect heterologous desensitization. We report novel observations concerning heterologous desensitization of GPCR-activated GIRK channels. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells (a gift from Dr. J. Lomasney) were grown in Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). The medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and streptomycin/penicillin (100 units each). Cells were grown under 7% CO2 at 37 °C. In all transfections for electrophysiological studies, the CD8 reporter gene system was used to visualize transfected cells (20.Jurman M.E. Boland L.M. Liu Y. Yellen G. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 876-881PubMed Google Scholar). Dynabeads coated with anti-CD8 antibodies were purchased from Dynal. The cells were transfected as described below with various plasmids from the following list: human M2 mAChR (in pcDNA3, 0.8 μg), M2Δ1 (in pCR3, 0.8 μg) (21.Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29004-29011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), M4 mAChR and M3 mAChR (both in pcDNA3, 0.8 μg each) (gifts from Dr. E. Peralta), human A1 or A3 adenosine receptors (in CLDN 10B, 0.2 μg; gifts from Dr. J. Linden), human α2A or α2C adrenergic receptors (in pcDNA3.1, 0.5 μg; gifts from Dr. L. Hein), human α1A adrenergic receptors (in pcCMV5, 0.5 μg; a gift from Dr. J. Lomasney), mouse GIRK1 (in pC1, 0.3 μg; a gift from Dr. F. Lesage), mouse GIRK4 (in pcDNA1, 0.3 μg; a gift from Dr. F. Lesage), human Gβ1 (in pCMV5, 0.3 μg; a gift from Dr. H. A. Bourne), human Gγ2 (in pcDNA1, 0.3 μg; a gift from Dr. H. A. Bourne), and human CD8 (in H3, 0.15 μg; a gift from Dr. G. Yellen). The transfection method used in this study was based on a method (22.Forsayeth J.R. Garcia P.D. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 354-358PubMed Google Scholar) in which replication-deficient adenoviruses lacking the E1 gene were coated with DEAE-dextran and mammalian expression vectors to import the cDNAs of interest. Ad5dl312 viruses (a gift from Dr. K. Rundell) were allowed to replicate in HEK293 cells and were harvested when 70–90% of the HEK293 cells were rounded up. The cells were centrifuged gently, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of Ham's F-12 medium/10-cm dish of cells. For cell lysis, cells were frozen and thawed three times and centrifuged. The supernatant was used as the viral stock solution. The viral stock (10 μl) was diluted with 130 μl of Ham's F-12 medium, and 80 μg of DEAE-dextran was added. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 5–10 min. The total amounts of plasmid DNA (2.2 μg) were added (empty pcDNA 3.1 was used to balance cDNA amounts), and the mixture was incubated for another 2–5 min. Ham's F-12 medium (2 ml) was added, and this transfection solution was added onto one plate of 60–70% confluent CHO K1 cells. Prior to the incubation the cells were washed three times with 3 ml of serum and antibiotic-free medium. All assays were performed 48–72 h posttransfection. For the measurement of K+ currents an extracellular solution of the following composition was used (mm, pH 7.4): NaCl, 120; KCl, 20; CaCl2, 2; MgCl2, 1; Hepes-NaOH, 10. The internal (pipette) solution contained (mm): potassium glutamate, 100; KCl, 40; MgATP, 5; Hepes-KOH, 10; NaCl, 5; EGTA, 2; MgCl2, 1; GTP, 0.01 (pH 7.4). All standard salts as well as acetylcholine (ACh), adenosine (Ado), and phenylephrine (PhE) were from Sigma. Membrane currents were recorded under voltage clamp using conventional whole cell-patch clamp techniques (23.Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15098) Google Scholar). Patch pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass capillaries (GF-150–10, Warner Instruments) using a horizontal puller (P-95, Fleming & Poulsen). The DC resistance of the filled pipettes ranged from 2 to 5 megohms. Membrane currents were recorded using a patch clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200, Axon Instruments). Signals were analog-filtered using a low-pass Bessel filter (1–3 kHz corner frequency). Data were digitally stored using an IBM-compatible PC equipped with a hardware/software package (ISO2 by MFK, Frankfurt/Main, Germany) for voltage control, data acquisition, and data evaluation. IKACh was measured as an inward current using a holding potential of −90 mV as described (24.Bünemann M. Brandts B. zu Heringdorf D.M. van Koppen C.J. Jakobs K.H. Pott L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 489: 701-777Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Voltage ramps (from −120 mV to +60 mV in 500 ms, every 10 s) were used to determine current-voltage relationships. M2 mAChRs, as well as A1adenosine receptors, can activate inwardly rectifying potassium currents carried by GIRK channels when the receptors and channel subunits are transiently co-expressed in CHO K1 cells. Agonist-activated currents were measured, using the whole cell-patch clamp configuration, as inward currents by setting the membrane potential negative (−90 mV) to the potassium equilibrium potential of about −50 mV (20 mm external potassium). In cells transfected with the GIRK subunits and the M2 mAChRs, application of ACh (1 μm) caused an activation of GIRK currents that rapidly desensitized during a 2-min application of ACh (Fig. 1 A, left panel). In contrast, in cells transfected with the GIRK subunits and the A1 adenosine receptors, rapid superfusion of the cells with adenosine (1 μm) induced an inwardly rectifying K+ current that exhibited only a marginal desensitization after a 2-min application of adenosine, and after washout of the agonist, GIRK currents deactivated to basal levels (Fig.1 A, right panel). To determine whether the desensitization of the ACh response took place at the level of the M2 mAChR or downstream of it, we analyzed the effects of a series of successive exposures to Ado and ACh in cells co-expressing both the A1 adenosine receptors and the M2 mAChRs (Fig. 1 B). An initial exposure to adenosine induced GIRK currents that were stable after an initial rapid, small desensitization (this type of desensitization is not the topic of this study but was studied in recent papers (25.Chuang H.H., Yu, M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11727-11732Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 26.Vorobiov D. Levin G. Lotan I. Dascal N. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 436: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 27.Shui Z. Boyett M.R. Zang W.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 505: 77-93Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar)). After washout of Ado and a return of currents to basal levels, the cells were exposed to ACh. The ACh-induced currents were of similar amplitude compared with those induced by Ado; however, again the ACh-induced GIRK currents markedly desensitized during the 2-min exposure to ACh. To test if the ACh treatment would affect subsequent effects of Ado, we exposed the cells to a second application of Ado within 1 min after the washout of ACh (Fig. 1 B). These Ado-elicited GIRK currents were substantially reduced compared with the initial Ado response (Fig.1 B), demonstrating that the prior treatment with ACh caused an inhibition of the subsequent Ado response. That the ACh-induced reduction of the Ado response was attributable to the preceding stimulation of M2 mAChR receptors was demonstrated by the observation that in cells lacking the M2 mAChRs, no inhibition of the Ado response by pretreatment with ACh was observed (Fig. 1 C). In addition, prior treatment with Ado did not substantially reduce the effects of a second stimulus with Ado (Fig.1 C), indicating that the activation of GIRK currents itself was not sufficient to cause desensitization. Furthermore, that prior application of Ado was not responsible for the M2mAChR-induced desensitization and inhibition of the GIRK currents was demonstrated by results showing similar responses elicited by the M2 mAChR in cells not previously stimulated with Ado (Fig.1 A and data not shown). The summarized results from a series of similar experiments demonstrated that prior exposure to ACh caused a reduction of the subsequent Ado response to 56 ± 4% (n = 13) of the initial Ado response, whereas prior exposure to Ado only caused a reduction of 5 ± 2.2% (n = 7) (Fig. 1 D). The results suggested that activation of the mAChRs caused an initial activation followed by an inhibition of GIRK currents and that the inhibition persisted during a subsequent exposure to Ado and thus diminished the response to Ado. To test if the ACh-induced inhibition of the Ado currents was reversible, we performed similar experiments as described above, in which we tested the effects of successive treatments with Ado at different times following a desensitizing treatment with ACh. The cells were co-transfected with the GIRKs and both receptors and initially exposed to a brief pulse of Ado, which activated the currents (Fig.2). After washout of Ado, the cells were exposed to ACh for 2 min during which there was an initial activation of the GIRK currents to ∼75% of the extent observed with Ado, followed by a substantial inhibition (Fig. 2). Immediately following washout of the ACh the cells were exposed briefly to Ado, and the response was substantially reduced compared with the initial Ado response (Fig. 2). However, the size of the Ado-induced currents increased over time following the washout of ACh, as the subsequent treatments with Ado resulted in larger currents. After 6 min following the washout of ACh, the response to Ado was almost comparable with that of the initial Ado response (Fig. 2, last trace). These results demonstrated that the ACh-induced inhibition of the currents was reversible, albeit with a relatively slow time scale (t 12 = 2–5 min). To test whether the ACh-induced inhibition of the currents was due to cross-desensitization of A1 receptors and whether GTP-binding proteins were participating in the inhibitory pathway, we performed experiments in which we activated the currents by preactivating the Gi proteins with GTPγS added to the pipette solution. This strategy allowed us to eliminate the need to first activate the currents with Ado, thus bypassing the Ado receptor, and allowed us to ask whether ACh could inhibit currents activated directly by G proteins. The amplitude of the GTPγS-activated GIRK currents was determined by a short application of 0.5 mmBa2+, which is sufficient to completely inhibit GIRK currents but does not significantly affect endogenous currents and therefore is used to define the base line (28.Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) (Fig.3). The difference in currents before and after Ba2+ reflected the amplitude of the GTPγS-activated currents, and it can be seen in Fig. 3 that GTPγS caused a substantial activation of the currents. After a complete washout of Ba2+ and the return of the currents to the activated state, the cell was superfused with ACh for 1 min. Surprisingly, following an initial small, further activation of the currents, the activation of the M2 mAChRs by ACh caused a marked inhibition of the GTPγS-induced K+ currents (Fig. 3). The extent of inhibition of the GTPγS-activated currents by ACh was 57.5 ± 7.2% (n = 4, summarized in Fig.4 C). Moreover, in contrast to experiments performed without GTPγS (for example Fig. 2), no recovery from the ACh-induced inhibition of the GIRK currents was observed, even after 20 min after washout of ACh (Fig. 3). The inhibition of GTPγS-activated GIRK currents by ACh suggested that the ACh-induced inhibition was due to an inhibitory effect at the level of the G proteins or GIRKs. In addition, the results suggested that the inhibition of the Ado-induced GIRK currents by the M2mAChRs (Figs. 1 B and 2) was probably not due to a cross-desensitization of the A1 adenosine receptors. To avoid confusion we refer to this phenomenon as “ACh-induced inhibition of the GIRK currents” rather than heterologous desensitization. The observation that the M2 mAChR-induced inhibition of the GIRK currents became quasi-irreversible in the presence of intracellular GTPγS strongly suggested the involvement of GTP-binding proteins in this inhibitory pathway, as the poorly hydrolyzed GTPγS should lead to long lasting activation of GTP-dependent processes.Figure 4Inhibition of GIRK currents constitutively activated by heterologously expressed Gβ1γ2by activation of M2 mAChR. CHO cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding for Gβ1 and Gγ1subunits as well as GIRK1/4 and M2 mAChR. A, basal GIRK current levels under these conditions were determined by brief applications of Ba2+ (the arrow at theright of the current trace indicates current level in the presence of Ba2+). Addition of ACh did not result in any further current increase, indicating that GIRK channels were fully activated by co-expressed Gβγ. However, during the 2-min application of ACh a moderate inhibition of the GIRK currents was observed. B, characteristics of the ACh-inhibited current as determined by subtracting the current-voltage curves obtained prior to (A, a) and during (A, b) the application of ACh. C, summarized data of the inhibition (expressed as % inhibition) of GIRK currents either activated by GTPγS (as described in Fig. 3) or by heterologously expressed Gβγ in response to ACh for 2 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further define where the inhibition of GIRK currents by M2 mAChR occurred, we studied the M2 mAChR-induced inhibition of GIRK channels that were prestimulated with heterologously expressed Gβγ subunits. CHO cells that were transiently transfected with M2 mAChR, GIRK1, GIRK4, and Gβ1γ2 exhibited constitutively activated GIRK currents that were blocked by 0.5 mm Ba2+ (Fig. 4 A). The currents obtained with Gβγ expression were activated to a much larger degree than with receptor activation or GTPγS (compare Figs. 1, 2, and 3) and presumably reflected full activation of the channels. Consistent with this notion, stimulation of M2 mAChR with ACh did not cause any further increase in Ba2+-sensitive GIRK currents (Fig. 4 A). Notably, in most cases ACh still caused a reduction of basal currents (Fig. 4 A). These ACh-inhibited currents were found to have identical current-voltage relationships as GIRK currents (Fig. 4 B), indicating that the Gβγ-induced channel activity was inhibited by stimulation of M2 mAChR. However, the ACh-induced inhibition of GIRK currents in the presence of expressed Gβγ was significantly less (20 ± 3.8%,n = 8 after a 2-min application of 1 μmACh) compared with GIRK currents activated by GTPγS and endogenous G proteins (Fig. 4 C). Because these results were obtained under conditions in which full activation of the channels was induced by overexpression of Gβγ, the results suggested that the inhibitory effect of the M2 mAChRs on GIRK currents was due to a reduced interaction between the G proteins and the channels. The smaller inhibitory effect observed under these conditions presumably reflected competition between the receptor-induced inhibitory signal and the large pool of active Gβγ subunits. Because GTP-binding proteins seem to be involved in mediating the inhibitory effect of M2 mAChR on GIRK currents (Fig. 3), we tested whether PTX-sensitive G proteins were involved. To do this, transfected CHO cells expressing Gβγ subunits, GIRK1, GIRK4, and M2mAChR were pretreated with 200 ng/ml PTX for 4–6 h and subsequently tested for an ACh-induced inhibition of the Gβγ-activated GIRK currents (Fig. 5). The PTX pretreatment did not prevent or reduce the inhibitory effect of M2 mAChR on GIRK currents (inhibition of Ba2+-sensitive GIRK currents after a 2-min incubation with 1 μm ACh was 17.5 ± 6.6%, n = 4). In cells in which Gβγ subunits were not co-expressed, the PTX pretreatment completely blocked activation of GIRK currents by A1 receptors or M2 mAChR (n = 4, data not shown), indicating that the PTX treatment was 100% effective in blocking receptor-mediated activation of Gi and Goproteins. Thus, the inhibitory effects of the M2 mAChR on the GIRK channels, in contrast to their stimulatory effects, did not appear to involve a PTX-sensitive G protein. In addition, pretreatment with PTX did not alter the time course of recovery from inhibition after removal of ACh (data not shown). To test whether other GPCRs could also inhibit GIRK currents, M3 and M4 mAChRs were tested as well as A3 purinergic receptors and α2A and α2C adrenergic receptors. The M4 mAChRs, which, like the M2mAChRs are known to couple to PTX-sensitive G proteins, were as effective as M2 mAChRs in activating GIRK currents and in inducing the inhibition of GIRK currents upon treatment of transfected cells for 2 min with ACh (Fig. 6). Furthermore, activation of the M4 mAChRs caused an inhibition of a subsequent activation of the A1 receptors in a manner that was very similar to that caused by the M2mAChRs (compare Figs. 1 B and 6). In contrast, the other Gi/Go-linked GPCRs tested, namely the α2A and α2C adrenergic receptors and the A3 adenosine receptors, exhibited no obvious inhibitory effect on GIRK currents and basically behaved the same as A1 adenosine receptors (n = 5, data not shown). On the other hand, activation of M3 mAChRs, which activate Gq proteins rather than PTX-sensitive G proteins, caused a strong inhibition of Ado-activated GIRK currents. The inhibition of GIRK currents by the M3 mAChRs was not blocked by PTX in experiments similar to those described in Fig. 5. To test whether the inhibitory action on GIRK currents was specific for muscarinic receptors, the α1A adrenergic receptor (AR), another Gq-coupled receptor, was tested. Whereas activation of α1A adrenergic receptors with phenylephrine caused a very modest activation of the GIRK currents compared with Ado (Fig.7 A), these receptors caused a robust inhibition of GIRK currents as observed by the striking reduction in the ability of subsequent pulses of Ado to activate the currents (Fig. 7 A). Thus the inhibition of the GIRKs was observed with several subtypes of the mAChRs as well as with the α1A adrenergic receptor.Figure 7The inhibition of GIRK currents could be mediated by Gq-dependent and -independent pathways. CHO cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs for M2 mAChRs, A1 Ado receptors, GIRK1/4, and the Gq-coupled α1A ARs. A, experiments similar to those described in Figs. 1 B and 2were performed except that the AR agonist"

A passive Ca2+ load inside microsomal vesicles clearly decreased the net uptake rate and the final accumulation of Ca2+ but not the UTP hydrolysis rate, causing energy uncoupling. In the absence of passive leak, the Ca2+/Pi coupling ratio was 0.7–0.8. UTP hydrolysis did not maintain a rapid component of Ca2+exchange between the cytoplasmic and lumenal compartments as occurs with ATP. The uncoupling process in the presence of UTP is associated with: (i) the absence of a steady state accumulation of ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme; (ii) the cytoplasmic dissociation of Ca2+bound to the ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme; and (iii) the absence of enzyme inhibition by cyclopiazonic acid. All these characteristics confirm the lack of enzyme conformations with low Ca2+affinity and point to the existence of an uncoupling mechanism mediated by a phosphorylated form of the enzyme.

Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 186-189Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (193) Google Scholar). A decrease in energy conservation efficiency gives rise to the phenomenon of uncoupling. A self-evident source of uncoupling is the loss of ionic gradient through ionophoric activity (2.Kessler R.J. Tyson C.A. Green D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 78: 3141-3145Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 3.Hanstein W.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 456: 129-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 4.Scarpa A. Baldassare J. Inesi G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1972; 60: 735-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), although a more subtle origin may be the catalytic mechanism itself (intramolecular uncoupling). Uncoupling has been observed in different energy-transducing systems and has been reported to depend on the experimental conditions tested. For instance, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)1Ca2+-ATPase presents Ca2+ transport/ATP hydrolysis coupling ratios of 2, when measured under pre-steady state conditions (5.Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Verjovski-Almeida S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1978; 307: 224-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, steady state measurements have given values ranging from 1.3 to 1.8 (6.de Meis L.

Chem. 1979; 254: 2302-2307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) provided values near to 1. Likewise, some reports have given coupling ratios of around 2 for UTP and other nonphysiological substrates (11.Makinose M. The R. Biochem. Z. 1965; 343: 383-389PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Hasselbach W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 515: 23-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Ca2+-ATPase intramolecular uncoupling in the presence of ATP has been related through indirect evidence to the cytoplasmic dissociation of Ca2+ from the phosphorylated intermediate (7.Meltzer S. Berman M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4244-4253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Yu X. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4361-4367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, a rapid efflux of lumenal Ca2+ involving nonphosphorylated species of the enzyme has also been suggested as a possible uncoupling mechanism (13.de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5736-5742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Wolosker H. de Meis L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1376-C1381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction cycle in the presence of ATP is difficult to analyze because the substrate has complex kinetic effects that may be complicated by the existence of rapid Ca2+ exchange between the cytoplasmic and lumenal compartments. We therefore selected UTP because it behaves in a more straightforward manner when it acts as phosphorylating agent and does not support rapid Ca2+ exchange. In this way, the study of the uncoupling mechanism was facilitated by the use of UTP. Our experimental system consisted of sealed vesicles that were isolated from skeletal SR membrane. The preparation was enriched in Ca2+-ATPase protein, retained the native orientation of the membrane (15.Inesi G. Scales D. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3298-3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and showed low passive permeability (16.Inesi G. de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5929-5936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we explored different experimental conditions in the presence of UTP as an ATP surrogate. Data analysis of UTP hydrolysis, Ca2+movement, and phosphoenzyme conformations provided clear illustrations of how the uncoupling mechanism works during enzyme cycling. Fast-twitch skeletal muscle from adult female New Zealand rabbit was used as starting material. Sealed right-side vesicles mainly derived from SR longitudinal tubules were prepared by the method of Eletr and Inesi (17.Eletr S. Inesi G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 282: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The final pellet was resuspended at 10–15 mg protein/ml, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C until use. This preparation shows no significant level of passive leakage because of the absence of Ca2+ release channel (16.Inesi G. de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5929-5936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The SR protein was estimated by the colorimetric procedure of Lowry et al. (18.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Concentrations of free Ca2+ were adjusted by adding appropriated CaCl2/EGTA mixtures according to the computer program developed by Fabiato (19.Fabiato A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 378-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Calculations were based on the Ca2+-EGTA absolute stability constant (20.Schwartzenbach G. Senn H. Anderegg G. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1982; 40: 1886-1900Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and the EGTA protonation equilibria (21.Blinks J. Wier W. Hess P. Prendergast F. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1982; 40: 1-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Relevant Ca2+ ligands and pH in the medium were also considered. This was achieved by equilibrating SR vesicles at 5 mg protein/ml in a medium containing 20 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, and 10, 20, or 40 mm CaCl2. Radioactive45Ca2+ at ∼5,000 cpm/nmol was also included when indicated. Incubation lasted 4 h at 30 °C. The release of inorganic phosphate in the min time scale was measured under stirring at 25 °C, according to Lin and Morales (22.Lin T. Morales M. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 77: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The enzymatic reaction was started by diluting aliquots 100-fold of passively Ca2+-loaded vesicles (0.085 ml) in a medium containing 20 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm UTP, and sufficient CaCl2 and/or EGTA to yield a final free Ca2+ in the external medium of 50 μm. This was calculated taking into account the external Ca2+ withdrawn with each aliquot of loaded vesicles. After dilution, the membrane protein concentration was 0.05 mg/ml. The same protocol was applied in experiments performed with Ca2+-unloaded vesicles. The composition of the dilution media is given in the legend of Fig. 1. The reaction was stopped at various times by adding 1-ml samples of reaction mixture to the nitric acid/molybdovanadate reagent. The Ca2+-independent activity was evaluated in Ca2+-unloaded vesicles by including 0.5 mm EGTA in the dilution medium and omitting CaCl2. UTP hydrolysis was also measured in the second time scale by a radiometric procedure. Experiments were carried out at 25 °C under stirring, in the absence or presence of 5 mm potassium oxalate. SR vesicles (0.4 mg protein/ml) were initially suspended in a medium containing 20 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 80 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 0.545 mm CaCl2, (50 μm free Ca2+). In one case, the reaction was started by adding 1 mm [γ-32P]UTP (∼20,000 cpm/nmol) and in the other by adding 1 mm UTP with a pulse of [γ-32P]UTP (∼1 × 107 cpm) being delivered 2 min later. Zero time corresponded to the addition of radioactive UTP. In both cases, aliquots of the reaction mixture (0.5 ml) were quenched at different times with 0.5 ml of ice-cold 250 mm perchloric acid plus 4 mm sodium phosphate. The quenched samples were incubated in ice water bath for 5 min. The complete volume (1 ml) was filtered through a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filter, and the filtrate was collected. The subsequent treatment consisted of removing contaminant [γ-32P]UTP by charcoal, extraction of [32P]phosphomolybdate complex with isobutanol/benzene, and quantitation of32Pi in the organic phase, according to a previously published procedure (23.Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Lewis D. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 154-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The specific activity of standard32Pi (cpm/nmol) was obtained by correlating the cpm of [γ-32P]UTP and the chemical concentration of the substrate. When a pulse of [γ-32P]UTP was added, the UTP concentration after 2 min of reaction (i.e. t = 0) was 0.75 mm, as deduced from the activity data. A 75% yield for the organic extraction of Pi and appropriate blank assays were also considered for the transformation of cpm into nmol Pi. The extraction yield was experimentally measured in 0.5 ml of reaction medium containing 1 mm [γ-32P]UTP. The procedure required chemical hydrolysis of the substrate and further processing as described for the samples. This was measured at 25 °C under stirring and with the aid of radioactive tracer. Vesicles were first passively loaded with 10, 20, or 40 mm45Ca2+, and the uptake was initiated by diluting aliquots 100-fold of 45Ca2+-loaded vesicles, as described for the corresponding UTP hydrolysis experiments. After dilution, the reaction mixture consisted of 20 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.05 mg/ml of SR protein, 1 mm UTP, and 50 μm free 45Ca2+. Total CaCl2 and/or EGTA in the dilution medium was adjusted according to the Ca2+ concentration used for loading. Loading and dilution media contained 45Ca2+ at the same specific activity (∼10,000 cpm/nmol). Full detail is given in the legend of Fig. 3. Ca2+-unloaded vesicles were also subjected to the same protocol. In both cases, aliquots containing 1 ml of reaction mixture were filtered under vacuum at different time intervals (scale of min), and the filters were then rinsed with 10 ml of ice-cold La3+ medium (20 mm Mops, pH 7.0, and 1 mm LaCl3). Radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting after solubilizing the filters. The unspecific Ca2+ retained by the filters was subtracted by performing a blank assay in the absence of UTP. UTP-dependent Ca2+ entry was measured in the second time scale as follows: samples of 0.25 ml containing 20 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.545 mm45CaCl2 (∼10,000 cpm/nmol), 0.5 mm EGTA (50 μm free45Ca2+), and 0.4 mg/ml of unloaded vesicles were mixed under continuous vortexing at 25 °C with 1 mmUTP. The reaction was quenched by adding 5 ml of ice-cold La3+ medium, and the resulting mixture was filtered under vacuum. The filters were rinsed and counted as before. Alternatively, SR vesicles were first actively loaded with40Ca2+ at 25 °C. The initial reaction medium was 20 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.545 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA (50 μm free Ca2+), 0.4 mg/ml of unloaded vesicles, and 1 mmUTP. A 45Ca2+ pulse, to give ∼10,000 cpm/nmol, was added 2 min later, zero time being taken as the moment of45Ca2+ addition. The reaction was arrested by adding 5 ml of ice-cold La3+ medium to an aliquot of 0.25 ml reaction mixture. Quenched samples were filtered and processed as described before. In some experiments, the reaction medium was supplemented with 5 mm potassium oxalate. Blank assays were performed following one of the described protocols but without the addition of UTP. This was studied under two different assay conditions. Phosphorylation in the presence of Ca2+ was performed at 25 °C in a medium containing 20 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.545 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA (50 μm free Ca2+), and 1 mg SR protein/ml. Phosphorylation in the absence of Ca2+and presence of dimethyl sulfoxide was performed at 25 °C in a medium consisting of 20 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 80 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 20% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 1 mg of SR protein/ml. Reactions were initiated by adding 0.1 mm [γ-32P]UTP (∼1 × 106 cpm/nmol) and stopped by mixing under vortexing 1 ml of reaction mixture with 1 ml of ice-cold 7% trichloroacetic acid plus 10 mm sodium phosphate. The reaction time was 10 s for Ca2+-containing samples and 30 s for Ca2+-deprived samples. Quenched samples were incubated in ice for 5 min and then sedimented at 4 °C by centrifugation (10,000 rpm for 5 min). The resultant pellets were washed three times with ice-cold quenching solution and once with double distilled water and then dissolved in 0.2 ml of electrophoresis sample buffer (24.Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots containing 10 μg of membrane protein were applied to a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel slab in the presence of 0.1% lithium dodecyl sulfate. Electrophoresis was carried out for 1 h at room temperature and 180 volts. (24.Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactive labels in the dried gel were detected by autoradiography at −80 °C. The x-ray film and the intensifying screen were Curix RP2 and Curix blue C2, respectively, from Agfa. The levels of radioactive EP at neutral pH and in the presence of K+ were measured in a medium containing 20 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 80 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.545 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA (50 μm free Ca2+), 0.4 mg/ml SR vesicles, and 1 mm[γ-32P]UTP (∼20,000 cpm/nmol). Potassium oxalate (5 mm) was also included when indicated. Phosphorylation was maintained for 2 min at 22 °C, and the reaction was stopped by adding 5 ml of ice-cold acid medium (125 mm perchloric acid plus 2 mm sodium phosphate) to 0.5 ml of reaction mixture. The denatured protein was incubated in ice for 5 min before being filtered through a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filter. The filter, once rinsed with 25 ml of ice-cold acid medium, was solubilized and counted by liquid scintillation technique. A blank was performed by adding the acid solution before the radioactive UTP. Phosphorylation at alkaline pH and in the absence of K+ was measured, as described above, in a medium containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.549 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA (50 μm free Ca2+), 0.4 mg/ml SR vesicles, and 1 mm [γ-32P]UTP at ∼20,000 cpm/nmol. Changes in TNP-ATP fluorescence were measured at 22 °C with a Shimadzu RF-540 spectrofluorimeter in a continuously stirred cuvette. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 420 and 540 nm, respectively. The cuvette content was 20 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.149 mmCaCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA (Ca2+ free was 50 μm), and 0.1 mg/ml SR vesicles. Potassium oxalate (5 mm) was present in some experiments. Fluorescence intensity was recorded in the min time scale before and after the sequential addition of 2 μm TNP-ATP and 1 mm UTP. Other measurements were performed in a medium containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.15 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA (50 μm free Ca2+), 0.1 mg/ml SR vesicles, 2 μm TNP-ATP, and 1 mm UTP. The fluorescence units correspond to a ratio between the intensity after addition of UTP (ΔF) and the intensity after addition of TNP-ATP (F). The availability of Ca2+ bound to the enzyme for cytoplasmic isotopic exchange was studied at 22 °C by a rapid filtration technique (25.Dupont Y. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 142: 504-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). When Ca2+-unloaded vesicles were used, 1-ml aliquots containing 20 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.149 mm45CaCl2 (∼15,000 cpm/nmol), 0.1 mm EGTA, and 0.2 mg/ml of SR protein were added onto nitrocellulose filters placed in the filtration apparatus. The filters were immediately flushed, under electronic control, with a medium containing 20 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.149 mmCaCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm UTP. The same procedure was applied for Ca2+ dissociation in unloaded vesicles. The perfusion medium was 20 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA. In other experiments, SR vesicles (0.2 mg/ml) were initially loaded with Ca2+, at 22 °C for 5 min, in a medium containing 20 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 80 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.149 mm45CaCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm UTP. Thereafter, 1-ml samples of actively45Ca2+-loaded vesicles were subjected to the rapid filtration procedure as described above. The perfusion medium was 20 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.149 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm UTP. Radioactivity retained by the filters was evaluated, without any further washing, by liquid scintillation counting. Blank assays were performed in the absence of SR vesicles. UTP hydrolysis as a function of time was measured at 25 °C in a medium containing 20 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.149 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA (50 μm free Ca2+), and 0.05 mg/ml of SR vesicles (i.e. 0.2 μmCa2+-ATPase). The reaction was started (t = 0) by adding 1 mm UTP. The CPA effect was evaluated by adding 0.4 μm CPA at t = 9 min. The CPA effect in leaky vesicles was measured by a similar procedure, although the reaction medium was supplemented with 4 μm A23187. Control assays were performed by not adding CPA. Inorganic phosphate released before and after the CPA addition was evaluated by mixing aliquots of 1 ml of reaction mixture and 1 ml of color reagent at different times (22.Lin T. Morales M. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 77: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Radioactive tracers45Ca2+, and [γ-32P]UTP were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. TNP-ATP was from Molecular Probes Europe. CPA from Penicillium cyclopium (C 1530) and the liquid scintillation mixture (S 4023) were products of Sigma. A 5 mg/ml stock solution of CPA was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide. The Ca2+ standard solution (Titrisol) was purchased from Merck. A23187 from Streptomyces chartreusensis was a Calbiochem product. Nitrocellulose filters with a 0.45-μm pore size were from Millipore. A Hoefer filtration box from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and a rapid filtration apparatus from Bio-Logic Co. (Claix, France) were used for sample filtration. Experimental points represent the average of at least three independent determinations, each performed in duplicate. Standard errors of the mean are also included. The SigmaPlot Graph System from Jandel Scientific was used for data fitting. The hydrolytic activity of the SR Ca2+-ATPase protein was evaluated by using 1 mm UTP as phosphorylating substrate. The assay conditions included a buffered medium at neutral pH, 80 mmK+, 5 mm Mg2+, and 50 μm free Ca2+. Fig.1 shows that the liberation of inorganic phosphate, in the minute time scale, is characterized by an initial burst followed by a linear phase. The experiments were carried out with native (Ca2+-unloaded) SR vesicles. The effect of lumenal Ca2+ on the Ca2+-UTPase activity, measured in the min time scale, was also checked. In this case, the vesicles were initially incubated for 4 h at 30 °C with a Ca2+concentration ranging from 10 to 40 mm. As can be seen, the passive loading of vesicles did not significantly modify the time-dependent appearance of phosphate. Therefore, it was not possible to establish a clear dependence between the rate of UTP hydrolysis and the initial Ca2+ load. Furthermore, Ca2+-independent UTP hydrolysis displayed a linear time course equivalent to 160 nmol Pi/min/mg protein, a rate that represented 55% of the steady state rate measured in the presence of Ca2+. The Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent activities were further investigated by studying the accumulation of phosphorylated intermediate at 25 °C after addition of 0.1 mm [γ-32P]UTP. In one case, SR vesicles were suspended in a standard reaction medium containing 50 μm free Ca2+, and in the other, the vesicles were suspended in a Ca2+-free medium and 20% dimethyl sulfoxide was added. Phosphorylation in the presence or absence of Ca2+ was started by adding radioactive nucleotide and stopped by acid quenching. Once the microsomes had been thoroughly washed and dissolved, the membrane proteins were subjected to electrophoresis and autoradiography (Fig.2). The electrophoretic profile oflanes 1 and 2 in Fig. 2 corresponds to samples phosphorylated in the presence or absence of Ca2+, respectively. The samples were stained with Coomassie Blue and presented the characteristic pattern of SR longitudinal tubules with Ca2+-ATPase (116-kDa) as the most abundant protein of the membrane. Moreover, autoradiographic analysis showed a radioactive band at the level of the Ca2+-ATPase protein when the vesicles were phosphorylated both in the presence (lane 3) and absence of Ca2+ (lane 4). This is a clear indication that both the Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent activities of UTP hydrolysis were associated with the Ca2+-ATPase protein. Lane 3also shows the Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of the 150- and 160-kDa calsequestrin-like proteins (26.Orr I Gechtman Z. Shoshan-Barmatz V. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Experiments were also directed at measuring the UTP-dependent Ca2+ uptake associated with the release of inorganic phosphate. When unloaded vesicles and 50 μm free 45Ca2+ were used in the external medium, the addition of 1 mm UTP was followed by the rapid entry of 45Ca2+, which reached asymptotic levels at approximately 80 nmol/mg protein (Fig.3 A). The effect of lumenal Ca2+ on net uptake was evaluated after a preliminary passive loading of the vesicles with 10–40 mm45Ca2+ and their subsequent addition to a transport medium containing 50 μm free45Ca2+. Caution was taken to ensure that the same 45Ca2+ specific activity existed in both passive loading and active transport media. The net uptake rate and the final accumulation of Ca2+ decreased with increasing initial Ca2+ loading (Fig. 3 A). The passive45Ca2+ load was 16, 21.5, or 30 nmol/mg of protein, when incubated with 10, 20, or 40 mm45Ca2+, respectively. At each time point of net uptake, we observed that the sum of the initial passive loading plus the net uptake was independent of the initial Ca2+ load (Fig. 3 B). Because Ca2+ pumping activity is an energy-dependent process linked to nucleotide hydrolysis, Ca2+ transport and UTP hydrolysis were evaluated in the same reaction medium, except that45Ca2+ was included for evaluating Ca2+ transport and [γ-32P]UTP to measure UTP hydrolysis. The transport process was stopped by La3+quenching and nucleotide hydrolysis by acid/color reagent. Both parameters were measured at the beginning or after 2 min of reaction,i.e. in coupled or uncoupled vesicles. The addition of 1 mm UTP to SR vesicles incubated in the presence of 50 μm free 45Ca2+ led to the nonlinear active accumulation of 45Ca2+, tending to an asymptotic level (Fig.4 A). These measurements, in the second time scale, were carried out at the beginning of Ca2+ pumping. Ca2+ entry was also evaluated after 2 min of active Ca2+ loading. In this case, 1 mm UTP was added to SR vesicles in the presence of40Ca2+, followed by a45Ca2+ pulse 2 min later. Under these conditions there was practically no 45Ca2+entry (Fig. 4 A). Parallel experiments performed in the presence of [γ-32P]UTP (Fig. 4 B) revealed that the rate of Pi release at the beginning of the reaction (430 nmol/min/mg of protein) was somewhat higher than that measured at t = 2 min (320 nmol/min/mg of protein). The effect of time on coupling (Fig. 4 B, inset) was revealed by the Ca2+/Pi ratio of 0.8 att = 1 s, which showed a tendency to decrease in the following seconds. Total uncoupling of the pump was observed after 2 min of reaction. The above coupling data prompted us to modify the assay conditions by adding 5 mm oxalate to the reaction medium and maintaining all the other conditions, including the temperature of 25 °C and 50 μm free 45Ca2+. The entry of active 45Ca2+ displayed a linear time course and very similar rates (220 versus 200 nmol Ca2+/min/mg of protein) when measured at the beginning or after 2 min of active 40Ca2+ loading, respectively (Fig. 5 A). The corresponding hydrolytic activities measured at the beginning or after 2 min of reaction also showed linear responses. The rates were 330 and 280 nmol Pi/min/mg of protein for unloaded or Ca2+-loaded vesicles, respectively (Fig. 5 B). Therefore, the coupling ratio at the beginning of pumping and in the presence of oxalate was 0.7 and did not vary with the Ca2+loading state of the vesicles (Fig. 5 B, inset). The vectorial translocation of Ca2+ involves the participation of two different EP conformations as outlined in the simplified reaction cycle (SchemeFSI). Therefore, the identification of accumulated EP species is a critical step for understanding the reaction cycle sustained by UTP. The experiments were performed at 22 °C in a reaction medium containing 50 μm free Ca2+. Total EP was measured by phosphorylating in the presence of 1 mm [γ-32P]UTP. In parallel experiments, the ADP-sensitive E1P·Ca2conformation was evaluated by adding 1 mm UTP in the presence of TNP-ATP. This is an indirect procedure because the TNP-ADP or TNP-ATP fluorescence signal detects the presence of the ADP-insensitive E2P (27.Andersen J.P. Jørgensen P.L. Møller J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4573-4577Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 28.Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11524-11531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.6 shows that the steady state phosphorylation level was around 3.7 nmol/mg of protein when measured at pH 7.0 and in the presence of K+. Likewise, the lack of TNP-ATP fluorescence under the same conditions indicated the absence of E2P, and so, the accumulated species was E1P·Ca2. The addition of oxalate to the neutral pH reaction medium containing K+ was associated with a decrease in the total EP accumulated. The steady state level was ∼2.1 nmol/mg of protein, and the phosphorylated form, as deduced from the absence of TNP-ATP fluorescence, was again E1P·Ca2. Some experiments were performed under conditions favoring a slow enzyme turnover and a large accumulation of E2P (29.Shigekawa M. Dougherty J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1451-1457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Nakamura Y. Tonomura Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 91: 449-461Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our data obtained at pH 8.0 and in the absence of K+ and oxalate indicated that the total EP increased up to 4.8 nmol/mg of protein, and this was associated with a large increase in TNP-ATP fluorescence,i.e. a massive accumulation of E2P.Figure 6Levels of phosphorylated species under turnover conditions. Total EP was measured at 22 °C by radiometric procedure (open bars). Phosphorylation at neutral pH and in the presence of K+ was performed in a medium containing 20 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 80 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.545 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.4 mg/ml SR vesicles, and 1 mm [γ-32P]UTP.

Two NMDA receptor subunit families (NR1a-h and NR2A-D) have been identified; alternative splicing of a single NR1 gene generates eight isoforms with distinct functional properties, while heterogeneity within the NR2 subunit family results from expression of four closely related genes (for review see, Refs. 4.Mori H.

Intracellular signaling proteins, including some nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases, frequently contain modular domains that mediate interactions with effector and regulatory proteins. Src homology 3 (SH3) domains mediate protein-protein interactions with proline-rich target sequences that adopt a left-handed helical conformation (polyproline type II helix (19.Feng S. Chen J.K., Yu, H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 20.Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D.C. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 933-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar)). In the case of the tyrosine kinases Src and Abl, SH3 domains function in both negative regulation of kinase activity and substrate recruitment (21.Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T.

SH3 domains are also found in many other proteins involved in signal transduction and may be involved in cytoskeletal organization and the targeting of signaling molecules to specific subcellular locations (22.Musacchio A.

Analysis of rat NMDA receptor subunit amino acid sequences revealed a proline-rich region in the COOH-terminal portion of the NR2D subunit. This proline-rich region contains sequences that show striking homology to motifs known to bind to SH3 domains (19.Feng S. Chen J.K., Yu, H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L.

Our results reveal a selective interaction of the proline-rich region of the NR2D subunit with the SH3 domain of the Abl tyrosine kinase. Co-expression of NR2D with Abl in a model system results in suppression of kinase activity, suggesting a biologically significant interaction between these proteins. The anti-Abl monoclonal antibody K-12 and the antiphosphotyrosine antibodies PY20 and PY99 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-Abl antibody 8e9 has been described (29.McWhirter J.R. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1553-1565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The M2 anti-FLAG antibody and M2 anti-FLAG antibody resin were obtained from Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems or Sigma. Appropriate alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Southern Biotechnology Associates. NR1a cDNA was generously provided by Dr. Shigetada Nakanishi (Kyoto University Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan). NR2D cDNA (6.Monyer H. Burnashev N. Laurie D.J. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 529-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2897) Google Scholar) was the gift of Dr. Peter Seeburg (University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany). GST fusion proteins containing the SH3 domains of Fyn and PLCγ and the full-length Grb2 protein were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Glutathione-agarose and protein A-Sepharose were from Sigma. The coding sequence of the 8-amino acid FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) was added to a COOH-terminal fragment of the NR2D NMDA receptor subunit by PCR to generate the 2D866–1064 construct. This construct contains residues 866–1064 of the rat NR2D subunit, beginning immediately COOH-terminal to the M4 domain at Val866, extending through Gln1064, and terminating at the FLAG epitope. The nucleotide sequence of the PCR-amplified fragment was confirmed by automated DNA sequence analysis (Applied Biosystems). 2D866–1064 was subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for expression in 293T cells. PCR was used to amplify the COOH-terminal coding region downstream from the unique SacI site. The reverse primer added the FLAG epitope immediately adjacent to the COOH-terminal Val, thereby removing the naturally occurring stop codon. The forward primer included the unique SacI site. The resulting PCR product was subcloned into NR2DpcDNA3 to replace the normal COOH-terminal region. The nucleotide sequence of the PCR-amplified fragment was confirmed by automated sequence analysis (Applied Biosystems). Abl and ΔSH3 Abl were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA). The constitutively active Abl linker mutant, Abl-PP (24.Barila D. Superti-Furga G. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 280-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), was generated by two sequential rounds of mutagenesis in which prolines 242 and 249 were each mutated to alanine using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Mutants were confirmed by automated DNA sequence analysis (Applied Biosystems). Calcium phosphate-mediated transfection of 293T cells was as described previously (30.Rogers J.A. Read R.D. Li J. Peters K.L. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17519-17525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). 2–3 days after transfection, 293T cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed. For preparation of total cellular lysates, cells were sonicated in SDS-PAGE sample buffer; for immunoprecipitation from cells expressing 2D866–1064, cells were sonicated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100 supplemented with 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 50 μm Na2MoO4. For immunoprecipitation from cells expressing full-length NR2D, cells were sonicated in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% deoxycholate supplemented with 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 50 μmNa2MoO4. For immunoprecipitation, clarified cytosolic extracts were incubated with antibody and protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were isolated by centrifugation and washed three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer. Final immunoprecipitates were heated in SDS sample buffer. For immunoblotting, cytosolic extracts or immunoprecipitated proteins were run on 4–15% gradient polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were incubated for 1 h with the appropriate primary antibody at 1 μg/ml in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and 1.5% bovine serum albumin. The membranes were then washed in TBS-T and probed with a secondary antibody-alkaline phosphatase conjugate in TBS-T containing bovine serum albumin. Following further TBS-T washes, immunoreactive proteins were visualized colorimetrically using the alkaline phosphatase substrate nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. The coding sequence of the Abl SH3 domain was amplified by PCR using Bcr/Abl as a template and subcloned into the pGEX2T expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). SH3 domains from Src and GAP were subcloned into pGEX2T as described previously (31.Hjermstad S.J. Briggs S.D. Smithgall T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10519-10525Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 32.Briggs S.D. Bryant S.S. Jove R. Sanderson S.D. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14718-14724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids were used to express the SH3 domains as GST fusion proteins in bacteria. Fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-agarose beads as described previously (31.Hjermstad S.J. Briggs S.D. Smithgall T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10519-10525Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 33.Hjermstad S. Peters K.L. Brigss S.D. Glazer R.I. Smithgall T.E. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2283-2292PubMed Google Scholar). Combined lysates from 293T cells expressing 2D866–1064 were split into aliquots and incubated with the GST-SH3 fusions or GST alone (10 μg) immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads in a final volume of 1.0 ml of lysis buffer. Following incubation at 4 °C for 1 h, protein complexes were pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer. Associated proteins were eluted by heating in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the presence of 2D866–1064 was determined by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Analysis of deduced rat NMDA receptor subunit amino acid sequences revealed proline-rich sequences in the COOH-terminal portion of the NR2D subunit (Fig. 1). These sequences show striking similarities to those found in SH3 domain binding proteins (27.Rickles R. Botfield M.C. Weng Z. Taylor J.A. Green O.M. Brugge J.S. Zoller M.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5598-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). To determine whether the proline-rich domain of the NR2D subunit can act as an SH3 domain binding protein, in vitroSH3 domain binding assays were performed. A fragment of the NR2D cDNA, encoding amino acids 866–1064, was amplified by PCR and tagged at its COOH terminus with the 8-amino acid FLAG epitope. The resulting construct, 2D866–1064, was expressed in 293T human embryonic kidney cells and expression was verified by immunoblot and immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig.2). Lysates from 293T cells expressing 2D866–1064 were incubated with recombinant immobilized SH3 domain-GST fusion proteins, expressed and purified from E. coli. Following incubation and washing, bound 2D866–1064 was visualized by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2, the proline-rich fragment of the NR2D subunit bound only to the Abl SH3 domain. 2D866–1064 did not bind to other SH3 domains tested, including those from phospholipase C-γ, Src, Fyn, GAP, or the full-length Grb2 protein. In addition, 2D866–1064 did not bind GST alone. Lysates from nontransfected control cells did not bind to any of the SH3 domains tested (data not shown).Figure 2The proline-rich region of the NR2D subunit binds to the Abl SH3 domain.

Total cellular lysates (lysate) from 293T cells expressing the proline-rich region of the NR2D subunit, 2D866–1064, were run on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted using an antibody specific for the FLAG epitope. For immunoprecipitation (IP), soluble cellular extracts were incubated with the anti-FLAG antibody and protein G-Sepharose.

The SH3 domains tested are indicated. GST indicates the results from incubation of transfected 293T cell lysates with GST alone. The position of SH3 bound 2D866–1064 is indicated by the arrowhead. Note that shadow bands are visible on the Western blots for Abl SH3-GST, Src SH3-GST, GAP SH3-GST, and GST proteins. The Fyn SH3, PLCγ SH3, and Grb2 GST fusion proteins are covalently coupled to the solid support (Santa Cruz) and are not visible as shadow bands on Western blots.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The interaction of the Abl SH3 domain with the proline-rich region of NR2D in vitro suggests that these two proteins may associate in a living cell. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to determine whether full-length Abl and NR2D form a stable complex in co-transfected 293T human embryonic kidney cells. As shown in Fig.3, both NR2D (tagged with the FLAG epitope at its carboxyl terminus) and 2D866–1064co-immunoprecipitated with Abl in 293T cells expressing both proteins. NR2D was not seen in the anti-Abl immunoprecipitates from cells expressing either form of NR2D alone (see Fig. 3, center lanes). These data suggest that the presence of NR2D in the anti-Abl immunoprecipitates results from a specific and stable interaction between the full-length proteins. To investigate whether NR2D and Abl functionally interact in a model system, 293T cells were transiently transfected with Abl and NR2D cDNAs. Transfection of Abl cDNA in a mammalian overexpression system, such as 293T cells, results in constitutive Abl kinase activity (34.Pendergast A.M. Muller A.J. Havlik M.H. Clark R. McCormick F. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5927-5931Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 35.Sawyers C.L. McLaughlin J. Goga A. Havlik M. Witte O. Cell. 1994; 77: 121-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Lysates were prepared from cells co-expressing wild-type Abl (WT) and either the full-length NR2D subunit or 2D866–1064, the proline-rich fragment of the NR2D subunit, and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4, overexpression of WT Abl in this system releases the negative regulation of tyrosine kinase activity as evidenced by autophosphorylation, in agreement with previous studies (34.Pendergast A.M. Muller A.J. Havlik M.H. Clark R. McCormick F. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5927-5931Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 35.Sawyers C.L. McLaughlin J. Goga A. Havlik M. Witte O. Cell. 1994; 77: 121-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, co-expression of either full-length NR2D or 2D866–1064 with WT Abl resulted in inhibition of Abl autokinase activity as indicated on the phosphotyrosine blot. Control blots verify expression of Abl and NR2D proteins. As shown in Fig.5 B, inhibition of Abl autophosphorylation was dependent on the amount of NR2D or 2D866–1064 cDNA transfected, with nearly complete inhibition at the highest NR2D levels tested. Pretreatment of transfected cells with vanadate (3–300 μm) did not alter the inhibition of Abl by NR2D (data not shown), ruling out the possibility that NR2D works through an intermediate protein-tyrosine phosphatase.Figure 5Inhibition of Abl by NR2D is dependent on the amount of NR2D expressed. A, lysates from cells co-transfected with Abl and the indicated microgram amount of 2D866–1064 expression plasmid DNA (left panels) were immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. The position of autophosphorylated Abl is indicted by the arrowhead. Control levels of Abl (middle blots) and NR2D (bottom blots) proteins are indicated by arrowheads. Abl was immunoprecipitated from lysates of cells co-transfected with Abl and the indicated amount of NR2D (right panels) using the anti-Abl antibody, K-12. Immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with antiphosphotyrosine (top blot) or anti-Abl (middle blot) antibodies. Arrowheads indicate the position of autophosphorylated Abl (top blot). Control levels of immunoprecipitated Abl (middle blot) or NR2D in cellular lysates (bottom blot) are indicated by thearrowheads. B, phosphotyrosine and anti-Abl immunoblots were scanned and immunoreactivity was quantitated using a Bio-Rad GS-710 calibrated imaging densitometer. The ratio of anti-phosphotyrosine immunoreactivity to anti-Abl immunoreactivity was determined to standardize tyrosine phosphorylation to levels of protein expression. Data are expressed as the percent control tyrosine phosphorylation (determined in the absence of NR2D). Shown are quantifications of experiments presented in A; these results are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because native NR2D exists as part of an oligomeric complex consisting minimally of NR2D and NR1 (36.Dunah A.W. Luo J. Wang Y.H. Yasuda R.P. Wolfe B.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), the NR2D subunit expressed in the absence of NR1 may not localize properly. Furthermore, it is possible that interactions with Abl in the absence of NR1 may not reflect the associations of the mature receptor with other proteins. To determine whether co-expression with the NR1 subunit alters the ability of NR2D to inhibit Abl autophosphorylation, 293T cells were co-transfected with NR1, NR2D, and Abl alone and in various combinations. Inhibition of Abl autokinase activity was observed in cells expressing Abl in combination with either NR2D alone or NR2D and NR1 but not in cells expressing Abl in combination with NR1 alone (Fig. 6). It is important to note that functional heteromeric receptors are observed in 293T cells 2(A. Qian, J. W. Johnson, and A. L. Buller, unpublished observations.co-expressing NR1 and NR2D subunits but not in cells expressing NR2 subunits alone (7.Kutsuwada T. Kashiwabuchi H. Mori H. Sakimura K. Kushiya E. Araki K. Meguro H. Masaki H. Kumanishi T. Arakawa M. Mishina M. Nature. 1992; 358: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar), suggesting that in the presence of the NR1 subunit, NR2D is inserted in the proper cellular location. Negative regulation of autokinase activity by the Abl SH3 domain has been reported (37.Franz W.M. Berger P. Wang J.Y.J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). To determine whether the Abl SH3 domain is critical for the inhibitory effect of NR2D on kinase activity, an Abl mutant lacking the SH3 domain (ΔSH3) was co-expressed with NR2D in 293T cells. 2D866–1064 did not inhibit autophosphorylation of ΔSH3 Abl (Fig. 7 A), indicating that inhibition by 2D866–1064 is dependent upon the Abl SH3 domain. In contrast to 2D866–1064, co-expression of the full-length NR2D subunit with ΔSH3 Abl produced partial inhibition of autokinase activity, suggesting the presence of additional sites of interaction between NR2D and Abl. Similar results were also obtained with Abl-PP, an Abl mutant containing two point mutations in the SH2-kinase linker region (Fig. 7 B). These mutations have been proposed to release negative regulation by the SH3 domain (24.Barila D. Superti-Furga G. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 280-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). As seen with ΔSH3, 2D866–1064did not inhibit Abl-PP autokinase activity (Fig. 7 B), suggesting that the proper spatial relationship between 2D866–1064 and the Abl SH3 and kinase domains is required for the inhibitory effect. In contrast, the full-length NR2D subunit partially inhibited Abl-PP kinase activity, similar to that seen for ΔSH3 Abl kinase activity. One of the most striking features of the NR2D subunit amino acid sequence is the prevalence of proline residues in the COOH-terminal region of the molecule, immediately downstream from the M4 domain. This proline-rich region localizes to the cytoplasmic surface of the cell membrane (38.Hollmann M. Monaghan D.T. Wenthold R.J. The Ionotropic Glutamate Receptors. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 39-79Crossref Google Scholar), making it a potential target for interactions with regulatory molecules. The data in this report provide evidence of a novel interaction between the NR2D subunit of the NMDA receptor and the Abl tyrosine kinase that may involve the proline-rich region of NR2D and the SH3 domain of Abl. SH3 domain-dependent interactions of ion channels with nonreceptor tyrosine kinases have been reported in other systems. Src kinase inhibits hKv1.5 potassium channel currents in an SH3 domain-dependent manner (39.Holmes T.C. Fadool D.A. Ren R. Levitan I.B. Science. 1996; 274: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Given the structural homology between the potassium channel and the NMDA receptor, it is interesting that the proline-rich domain of NR2D does not interact with the Src SH3 domain (see Fig. 2). However, the preferred Src SH3 domain binding motif (RPLPXXP (26.Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 27.Rickles R. Botfield M.C. Weng Z. Taylor J.A. Green O.M. Brugge J.S. Zoller M.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5598-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar)) is not present in the NR2D subunit. The Abl SH3 domain shows a preference for the peptide sequenceXPXXPPPΦXP, where Φ is any hydrophobic residue (27.Rickles R. Botfield M.C. Weng Z. Taylor J.A. Green O.M. Brugge J.S. Zoller M.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5598-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 28.Rickles R.J. Botfield M.C. Zhou X.M. Henry P.A. Brugge J.S. Zoller M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10909-10913Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This consensus sequence is closely approximated in the NR2D subunit (PPAKPPPQP; see Fig. 1). Data presented here demonstrate that complete inhibition of Abl autophosphorylation by NR2D requires the Abl SH3 domain, which has been implicated in the negative regulation of Abl kinase activity. An inhibitory intramolecular association between the Abl SH3 domain and sequences connecting the SH2 and kinase domains (SH2-kinase linker) has been proposed (24.Barila D. Superti-Furga G. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 280-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), based on an analogous interaction revealed in the x-ray crystal structures of the inactive form of c-Src and the closely related tyrosine kinase Hck (40.Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 41.Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). Mutations in the Src, Hck, and Abl SH2-kinase linker domains result in kinase activation (24.Barila D. Superti-Furga G. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 280-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 42.Gonfloni S. Williams J.C. Hattula K. Weijland A. Wierenga R.K. Superti-Furga G.

Chem. 1999; 274: 26579-26583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), presumably by disrupting the intramolecular SH3-linker interaction required for maintenance of the inactive state. Other work has shown that interaction with a ligand that binds exclusively to the SH3 domain of Hck induces kinase activation due to displacement of the linker region from the SH3 domain (44.Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 45.Briggs S.D. Sharkey M. Stevenson M. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17899-17902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Because 2D866–1064inhibits rather than stimulates kinase activity, and inhibition requires the SH3 domain of Abl, we conclude that 2D866–1064 must make additional contacts with Abl outside of the SH3 domain, possibly within the kinase domain itself. Furthermore, the inability of the NR2D proline-rich fragment to inhibit the activated linker mutant of Abl suggests that inhibition requires the wild-type structural relationship between the Abl SH3, linker, and kinase domains. In addition to the NR2D subunit of the NMDA receptor, a number of other proteins have been reported to interact with the Abl SH3 domain. Among these proteins, both AAP-1 (46.Zhu J. Shore S.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 7054-7062Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and PAG (47.Wen S. Van Etten R.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2456-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) have been shown to suppress kinase activity. Data presented in this report provide the first demonstration of a direct effect of a ligand gated ion channel subunit on tyrosine kinase function and may have important implications for the significance of Abl in the brain. Although specific functions for the Abl tyrosine kinase have not been determined, Abl plays a role in the negative regulation of cell growth (35.Sawyers C.L. McLaughlin J. Goga A. Havlik M. Witte O. Cell. 1994; 77: 121-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and interacts with cell cycle regulatory proteins (48.Wang J.Y.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 49.Baskaran R. Chiang G.G. Mysliwiec T. Kruh G.D. Wang J.Y. J. Biol.

In addition, recent evidence suggests a role for Abl in mediating the cellular stress response by activating the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase pathway (51.Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Ren R. Mayer B. Zon L. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30278-30281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase pathway is also activated by NMDA receptor stimulation (52.Schwarzschild M.A. Cole R.L. Hyman S.E. J.

Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1390-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that NMDA receptor-mediated activation of cellular stress pathways may be Abl-mediated. The localization of Abl and NMDA receptor subunits show several parallels. Subcellularly, Abl localizes to both the cytoskeleton and the nucleus (54.Van Etten R.A. Jackson P.K. Baltimore D.

The co-localization of Abl and NMDA receptors to the same subcellular compartment may provide an opportunity for these proteins to interact in a biologically relevant manner. Abl has been identified in the brain, in regions known to express NMDA receptor subunits (56.Grant S.G.N. O'Dell T.J. Karl K.A. Stein P.L. Soriano P. Kandel E.R.

Recently, a critical role for Abl and the Abl-related gene product Arg, in the development of the mammalian CNS has been demonstrated (58.Koleske A.J. Gifford A.M. Scott M.L. Nee M. Bronson R.T.

Given the unique developmental distribution of the NR2D subunit (13.Watanabe M. Inoue Y. Sakimura K. Mishina M.

The nucleotide sequence of the murine endothelial protein C receptor (mEPCR) gene was determined for 8.8 kilobase pairs of the genomic structure and 3.4 kilobase pairs of the 5′-flanking region. RNase protection assay revealed six major transcription start sites clustered at −100 to −109 upstream of the translation initiation site. A series of 5′-promoter deletion fragments were fused to a luciferase reporter gene and transiently transfected into bovine aortic endothelium. Deletion of the sequence from −220 to −180 dramatically reduced luciferase expression in bovine aortic endothelial cells. This region of the murine endothelial protein C receptor gene contains one AP4 site and one SP1 site. Mutations in the core sequence of the AP4 and SP1 sites impaired both nuclear protein binding and luciferase expression.

Rapid protein C activation requires thrombin binding to a cofactor, thrombomodulin (TM)1 on the surface of the endothelium. Deletion of the TM gene results in embryonic lethality in mice (3.Healy A.M. Rayburn H.B. Rosenberg R.D. Weiler H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The expression of EPCR, as observed by immunohistochemistry, is restricted to endothelial cells (4.Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol.

Like TM, EPCR is down-regulated by tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) on endotheliumin vitro, and the down-regulation of the two receptors follows the same time course (4.Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol.

The protein C pathway appears to be important in regulating the inflammatory response to LPS/endotoxin, as evidenced by the observations that APC can prevent lethality in a baboon sepsis model (13.Taylor Jr., F.B.

Gene deletion of protein C in mice results in prenatal consumptive coagulopathy and the infiltration of leukocytes into the liver (15.Jalbert L.R. Rosen E.D. Moons L. Chan J.C. Carmeliet P. Collen D.

Recent studies have demonstrated that blocking protein C binding to EPCR exacerbates the coagulation and inflammatory responses resulting from low levelEscherichia coli infusions into baboons (16.Taylor Jr., F.B.

Genetic defects in EPCR have now been identified in humans and may be associated with increased risks of arterial and venous thrombosis (17.Merati, G., Biguzzi, E., Oganesyan, N., Fetiveau, R., Qu, D. F., Bucciarelli, P., Stearns, D. J., Mannucci, P. M., Esmon, C. T., and Faioni, E. M. (1999) Thromb. Haemostasis, August Suppl., 507 (abstr.)Google Scholar). Thus, an understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control transcription of the EPCR gene may help clarify its role in the regulation of hemostasis and thrombosis. Here we describe the initial functional characterization of the murine EPCR promoter. Among other things, we identified a thrombin response element that potently up-regulates EPCR expression in response to thrombin both in endothelial cell culture and in vivo. Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were prepared as described previously (18.Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5571-5577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). EAhy926, a hybrid cell line created by fusion of HUVEC and A549 cells (19.Edgell C.-J.S. McDonald C.C. Graham J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3734-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Cora-Jean Edgell (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC), and was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FCS and hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT) selection media. HA, a murine hemangio-endothelioma cell line, was a kind gift from Dr. Paul Kincade, and maintained in DMEM/F12 containing 20% FCS. 293 human embryonal kidney cells (ATCC no. CRL 1573) and HeLa epithelioid cells (ATCC no. CCL 2) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. A murine genomic DNA bacteriophage P1 library was prepared by Genome Systems, Inc. (St. Louis, MO), and a 5-kilobase pairHindIII-BamHI fragment containing the 5′-flanking region of the mEPCR gene was inserted into the pBluescript II(+). The sequence of this fragment was determined on both strands using synthetic primers employing the dideoxy terminator method (20.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52770) Google Scholar). The newly reported sequence from −1200 to −400 has been deposited in GenBank (accession no. AF224271) and scanned for significant homology. Except for the region between −945 and −820, no significant homology was detected. The region −945 to −820 showed significant homology with a large number (100) of genes including the murine major histocompatibility locus GenBank AF1000956. The accession numbers of the 20 most similar genes follow: AF139987, AF100956, AB024501,AF133093, AC002324, AC005259, AF121351, AF125313, Y09047, AF126378,AF092505, AF111103, AC005807, AB012608, X93470, AJ001307, AF021335,L47235, AC009287, and AF109719. Templates for riboprobe synthesis were prepared by subcloning a 350-bp fragment containing the mEPCR 5′-flanking sequence from −350 to −1 into theKpnI/XhoI sites of the pBluescript II KS(+) plasmid to create pBKS-mP350. [γ-32P]CTP (800 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used with the MAXIscript in vitro transcription kit (Ambion) to generate riboprobes fromEcoRI-linearized pBKS-mP350. Full-length, radiolabeled cRNA was purified by electrophoresis through a 5% polyacrylamide gel, followed by elution for 4 h at 37 °C in 0.5 mammonium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS. The labeling efficiency was determined by scintillation counting, and approximately 2 × 105 cpm of each labeled riboprobe were used per reaction. The RNA protection assay was performed with an RPA II kit (Ambion). Briefly, the labeled riboprobes were annealed to 10–20 μg of total RNA isolated from HA or EAhy926 cells with the TRIZOL Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Following annealing, unprotected single-stranded RNA was digested with a mixture of RNase A (2.5 units/ml) plus RNase T1 (100 units/ml). Double-stranded RNA fragments were sized on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Two control reactions were performed in which each riboprobe was annealed to yeast RNA and incubated with the RNase mixture or the reaction buffer alone. A dideoxy DNA sequencing reaction of pBKS-mP350 was used as a size marker to map the transcription start sites of the endogenous mEPCR gene. After electrophoresis, the gel was vacuum-dried and exposed to x-ray film overnight with an intensifying screen at −80 °C. Promoterless basic and pGL3 control (SV40 promoter) plasmids were purchased from Promega, and the pβGal control was fromCLONTECH. An 1120-bp fragment spanning −1120 to −1 bp upstream of the translation start site of the mEPCR gene was obtained by amplification of the HB5K construct using PCR. The resulting DNA fragment was cloned into theKpnI-XhoI site of the pGL3 basic vector, generating GL3-mP1120. Constructs pGL-mP550, pGL-mP350, pGL-mP280, pGL-mP220, pGL-mP180, pGL-mP160, and pGL-mP80 were generated by ligation of the respective DNA segments generated by PCR from pGL3-mP1120 using the same strategy. Plasmid pGL-mP3340 was constructed in two steps: ligation into the HindIII and SacI sites of pBluescript II KS(+) of a 2260-bp fragment from −3340 to −1080 released from HB5K with HindIII and SacI, and insertion of this 2260-bp fragment released from pBKS withKpnI and SacI between the corresponding sites in the pGL-mP1120. To construct pGL-mP350Δ280–160, oligonucleotides 5′-GCCAAGCCCTTCTCCAGACAGATCCAA-3′ and 5′-TTGGATCTGTCTGGAGAAGGGCTTGGC-3′ were used to generate a DNA fragment in which −280 to −160 was deleted from the wild-type pGL-mP350. The following oligonucleotides were used to generate mutations in putative control elements: AP4, 5′-CCAGGCAGGAGGGCCCA A AG A TGGGAGGGGCCGAGGCG-3′; SP1, 5′-CCAGGCAGGAGGGCCCACAGCTGGGA AA GGCCGAGGCG-3′; AP4 and SP1, 5′-CCAGGCAGGAGGGCCCA A AG A TGGGA AA GGCCGAGGCG-3′. These oligonucleotides were used for PCR with the wild-type pGL-mP220 plasmid as the template. For mutations of the putative thrombin response element (ThR), the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used. The sense primer was: 5′-CATCGAAAGCAGACGCCC AGATCT GACTCAGCGGCGACCTAC-3′ and the antisense primer was 5′-GTAGGTCGCCGCTGAGTC AGATCT GGGCGTCTGCTTTCGATG-3′. Bold, underlined oligonucleotides represent the BglII restriction enzyme sites. These primers were used in PCR separately with both the wild-type pGL3-mP1120 and pGL3-mP350 as the templates. The PCR fragment was cloned into pGL3 that had been cut withSmaI and XhoI. All the constructs were verified by dideoxy sequencing the inserts and flanking regions with the sequenase kit (United States Biochemical Corp.). Transfection was carried out by the Lipofectin method (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were grown on 60-mm dishes to 70–80% confluence and transfected with 10 μg of various mEPCR-luciferase plasmids and the pGL3-control. To determine transfection efficiency, 5 μg of plasmid pβGal-control (containing the SV40 promoter) was co-transfected with each test plasmid. Following transfection for 8 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the medium was replaced with fresh Eagle's minimal essential medium, 10% FCS. In some experiments, the DNA-Lipofectin mix was replaced with fresh Opti-MEM I with or without bovine α-thrombin as indicated. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. The luciferase and β-galactosidase activities for each transfection were measured three times with a Monolight 2001 luminometer (PharMingen, CA). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured with Luciferin (PharMingen) and Galactan-star (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturers' instructions. The data represent the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments. Duplicate transfections were performed in each experiment. Nuclear extracts from BAEC were prepared as described previously (21.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of each extract was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were synthesized corresponding to −180 to −220 of the murine EPCR promoter region. These contained the wild-type sequence or mutations in the AP4, SP1, or AP4/SP1 sites. Probes were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Nuclear protein extracts prepared from BAEC were preincubated in a 20-μl reaction containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 3 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 10 μg of bovine serum albumin. Competitor DNA was added as needed. After incubation at room temperature for 20 min, the32P-end-labeled duplex oligonucleotides (≈2 × 105 cpm) were added, and the reaction was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Where indicated, 2 μg of rabbit anti-SP1 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the binding reaction for 30 min at room temperature prior to the addition of radioactive probe. Samples were then analyzed on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer (22.5 mm Tris base, 22.5 mm boric acid, and 0.5 mm EDTA). The gels were vacuum-dried and exposed to x-ray film overnight with an intensifying screen at −80 °C. A DNA fragment of the mEPCR promoter (−280 to −1) was isolated from pBKS-mP280 withEcoRI and HindIII in the presence of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase and was end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol). After labeling, the probe DNA was completely digested withHindIII to remove the label from the 3′ end of the fragment and to create the coding strand probe. The binding reaction (50 μl) was carried out in a reaction volume containing 2 × 104 cpm (1–2 ng) of the probe, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 50 μg of crude BAEC nuclear extract or 10 ng of purified SP1 protein (Promega). After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the reaction mixture was digested with freshly diluted DNase I for 1 min. Digestion was stopped by adding 90 μl of stop solution (200 mm NaCl, 30 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 100 μg/ml yeast tRNA). The DNA was then extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and analyzed on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. A dideoxy DNA sequencing reaction was electrophoresed in parallel to map the location of the protected region of the mEPCR promoter. After electrophoresis, the gel was vacuum-dried and exposed to x-ray film overnight with an intensifying screen at −80 °C. Transgenic mice were developed using the −350 to −1 or the −1080 to −1 region of the murine EPCR promoter to drive the structural gene for green fluorescent protein (GFP) to determine the in vivo activity of these regions of the EPCR promoter. The promoter region (−350 to −1) or (−1080 to −1) of the murine EPCR gene was cloned into the pEGFP1 vector (CLONTECH), which already contains the structural gene for GFP, using KpnI and SmaI sites. The fragment containing the promoter region of mEPCR and GFP reporter gene was released by Eco47III and AflII. After purification, the DNA fragments were microinjected into the pronuclei of fertilized murine eggs by standard methods. Mice were screened by standard methods for the presence of the transgene by GFP-specific PCR and Southern blotting. Four transgenic lines were established with the −350 to −1 construct and five lines with the −1080 to −1 construct. Transgenic animals bearing the pEGFP-350 or pEGFP-1080 construct were injected intraperitoneally with 400 μg of LPS (20 mg/kg). Controls were injected intraperitoneally with saline. The tails were cut before and after LPS treatment for the preparation of total RNA. When hirudin was employed, it was dissolved in saline and injected through the tail vein (100 units/kg). 30 min after beginning the hirudin injection, LPS was injected intraperitoneally as a bolus (20 mg/kg). In some control experiments, instead of hirudin, saline was injected before the LPS treatment. 3 h after the injection of LPS or saline, the animals were sacrificed, and the heart and lungs were immediately removed for RNA preparation. The study protocol received prior approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation. Total RNA was isolated from murine tails or organs with the Trizol reagent. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed with the Superscript Preamplification System as specified by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Before transcription, DNase I (RNase-free) was added to each RNA sample to ensure no contamination of the RNA preparation with DNA. For the competitive quantitative amplification of GFP and mEPCR mRNA, PCR mimics were constructed using the PCR Mimic construction kit (CLONTECH) as specified by the manufacturer. Each composite primer consisted of a target gene sequence (from GFP, mEPCR, or β-actin) attached to one of two 20-bp sequences designed to hybridize to opposite strands of a mimic DNA fragment, the ν-Erb gene. A second round of PCR was performed using only gene-specific primers. The PCR mimic was then purified and adjusted to a concentration of 100 amol/μl. For quantitative PCR, 10-fold dilutions of mimic were added to a series of tubes containing a fixed concentration of first-strand cDNA and a pair of gene-specific primers. 25 cycles of PCR was performed under each of the following conditions: 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. The gene-specific primers for murine EPCR and GFP were derived from the published sequences (18.Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5571-5577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 22.Cormack B.P. Valdivia R.H. Ralkow S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 173: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (2531) Google Scholar). The size of the amplified products exactly matched those predicted. The identity of the amplified fragments was further confirmed by restriction digestions with appropriate enzymes. Murine β-actin mimic and primers were provided by the manufacturer. The mEPCR and GFP primers were as follows: mEPCR sense primer, 5′-CCCTGGCAGGATCCGGAGAGC-3′ (nt 266–286); antisense primer, 5′-CTGCTTCAGGGTGAAGTTGGCTGCT-3′ (nt 568–544) (18.Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 5571-5577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); GFP sense primer, 5′-ATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAGCTG-3′ (nt 97–120); antisense primer, 5′-AGAAGATGGTGCGCTCCTGGACGT-3′ (nt 397–374) (22.Cormack B.P. Valdivia R.H. Ralkow S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 173: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (2531) Google Scholar). 1200 bp from the 5′-noncoding region of the gene coding mEPCR was isolated from the P1 genomic DNA library and sequenced (Fig. 1). The sequence from −400 to +60 was identical to that previously reported by Liang et al.(23.Liang Z. Rosen E.D. Castellino F.J. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 81: 585-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), while the additional sequence from −1200 to −400 was established in the present study. The bases are numbered relative to the translation initiation site. There is no canonical TATA or CCAAT box (23.Liang Z. Rosen E.D. Castellino F.J. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 81: 585-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) as there is in the human EPCR 5′-flanking sequence (24.Simmonds R.E. Lane D.A. Blood. 1999; 94: 632-641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is a putative TATA box, CTTTAAAAGCC (−152 to −142), and a weak CCAAT box, GGCCCACAGC (−220 to −211). Both of these boxes are within the optimal distance of 57–212 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site and are credible putative elements, which are required for the RNA polymerase II promoter (25.Bucher P. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 563-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). Potential regulatory elements were identified in the 5′ region of the murine EPCR gene including SP1, AP1, NF1, Ets, and AP4 binding sites. These sites had only one or two mismatches to the consensus sequences Having identified the genomic sequence for murine EPCR, we next attempted to define the transcription start sites of the gene using RNase protection of mRNA isolated from the murine HA cells. A32P-labeled antisense riboprobe (mP350) spanning −350 to −1 upstream of the protein sequence was annealed to total RNA isolated from HA cells. Following treatment with RNase A and RNase T1, the fragments protected from RNase digestion were separated electrophoretically as described. Six major transcription start sites at −100, −102, −104, −105, −107, and −109 bp were identified by comparison to the nucleotide sequence of mEPCR initiated at the base pair representing the 3′ end of the synthesized riboprobe (Fig.2). No protected bands were found when human EPCR RNA (from EAhy926 cells) or yeast tRNA were used, indicating the specificity of the assay. These potential transcription start sites fall between the putative TATA box and the translation initiation codon. The center-to-center spacing between the TATA box and cap signal was 35 bp. Initiation at the furthest upstream site would result in a 110-bp 5′-untranslated region. Multiple start sites are consistent with this relatively broad band detected in Northern blot analysis of murine tissue RNA (data not shown). To determine which regions of the 5′-flanking region of the mEPCR gene had promoter activity, we prepared chimeric constructs in which serially deleted fragments of the 5′-flanking sequence were inserted before a promoterless luciferase gene in the plasmid, pGL3-basic. Luciferase expression was measured after transfection of these constructs into BAEC. Constructs mP3340, mP1120, mP550, mP350, and mP280 promoted similar levels of luciferase activity, but background expression was observed in the construct mP160 and mP80 (Fig.3). The mP180 expression was only slightly above background. Deletion of the sequence between −220 and −180 dramatically reduced luciferase expression in BAEC, suggesting the presence of a positive regulatory element(s) in this region −220 to −180. Deletion constructs were transfected in different cell lines of both endothelial cell and non-endothelial origin. Similar results to those above were obtained in EAhy926 cells. All constructs were expressed poorly, if at all, in HeLa and 293 cells. In the promoter sequences of mEPCR, we found one AP4 site and one SP1 site between −220 and −180. It seemed likely these two elements were involved in the constitutive expression of mEPCR. To determine whether these elements could bind nuclear proteins, we synthesized 40 bp of double-stranded oligonucleotides encompassing this sequence (−220 to −180). The core sequences in AP4 and SP1 sites were mutated (Fig. 4 A). Wild-type,32P-end-labeled, double-stranded oligonucleotide probe was incubated with nuclear extracts from BAEC. Two DNA-protein complexes were found in the PAGE gels (Fig. 4 B). The formation of these two complexes was sequence-specific since it was prevented by addition of a 50-fold molar excess of the unlabeled oligonucleotide, but not by a 50-fold molar excess of oligonucleotide containing both SP1 and AP4 mutations. The upper band was apparently SP1, because it was eliminated by a 50-fold molar excess of the AP4 mutated oligonucleotide, but not by a 50-fold excess of the SP1 mutant. The lower band was apparently AP4, because it was eliminated by a 50-fold molar excess of the SP1 mutated oligonucleotide, but not by a 50-fold excess of the AP4 mutant. Thus, both the SP1 and AP4 sites are potentially functional. To test whether the core SP1 and AP4 sequence was required for binding of the nuclear proteins, we performed gel shift assays using different mutated oligonucleotides as probes (Fig. 4 C). When using the SP1 mutant probe, the probe was unable to bind the SP1 protein. Only the AP4 DNA-protein complex could be formed. This AP4 complex can be prevented by addition of a 50-fold molar excess of cold homologous probe, or the AP4 consensus probe, but not by either the AP4 mutant or the SP1/AP4 mutant competitors. The AP4 mutant probe was unable to bind the AP4 protein and only the SP1 DNA-protein complex could be detected. The SP1 complex band was eliminated by addition of a 50-fold excess of cold homologous probe, wild-type, or SP1 consensus oligonucleotides, but not by the SP1 mutant or the SP1/AP4 mutated oligonucleotides. If both the SP1 and AP4 sites were mutated, the probe was unable to bind to BAEC nuclear proteins. These data clearly show that the SP1 and AP4 elements in the region −220 to −180 of the mEPCR promoter can bind nuclear proteins from BAEC. A supershift assay was performed to test whether the binding of nuclear protein to the SP1 site (GGGAGGGG) of the mEPCR gene could be shifted by an SP1 antibody (Fig. 5). A single band was formed when BAEC nuclear extracts was incubated with labeled oligonucleotide probe containing the SP1 site (GGGAGGGG) of the mEPCR gene, and this band was competitively inhibited by a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe and SP1 consensus oligonucleotide, but not by a 50-fold molar excess of the SP1 mutated oligonucleotide. This band was supershifted with an antibody directed against SP1. The DNase I footprinting assay was employed to identify protected areas in the −220 to −180 region of the mEPCR promoter. When labeled probes were incubated with BAEC nuclear extracts, a protected area was identified from −200 to −214. When labeled probes were incubated with purified SP1 protein, a protected area was identified from −200 to"
https://openalex.org/W1982905036,"The electron-transferring flavoprotein (ETF) fromMethylophilus methylotrophus (sp. W3A1) exhibits unusual oxidation-reduction properties and can only be reduced to the level of the semiquinone under most circumstances (including turnover with its physiological reductant, trimethylamine dehydrogenase (TMADH), or reaction with strong reducing reagents such as sodium dithionite). In the present study, we demonstrate that ETF can be reduced fully to its hydroquinone form both enzymatically and chemically when it is in complex with TMADH. Quantitative titration of the TMADH·ETF protein complex with sodium dithionite shows that a total of five electrons are taken up by the system, indicating that full reduction of ETF occurs within the complex. The results indicate that the oxidation-reduction properties of ETF are perturbed upon binding to TMADH, a conclusion further supported by the observation of a spectral change upon formation of the TMADH·ETF complex that is due to a change in the environment of the FAD of ETF. The results are discussed in the context of ETF undergoing a conformational change during formation of the TMADH·ETF electron transfer complex, which modulates the spectral and oxidation-reduction properties of ETF such that full reduction of the protein can take place.

Muller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. II. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 471-486Google Scholar). ETFs have been isolated from mammalian systems (human, rat, and pig; Refs. 2.Ikeda Y.

Both mammalian and bacterial ETFs are αβ heterodimers possessing considerable sequence and structural homology to one another (9.Roberts D.L. Frerman F.E. Kim J.-J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14355-14360Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 10.Roberts D.L. Salazar D. Fulmer J.P. Frerman F.E. Kim J.-J.P.

The molecular mass of the α-subunit ranges from 31 to 42 kDa, that of the β-subunit is in the range of 25–38 kDa (1.Thorpe C. Muller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. II. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 471-486Google Scholar). One equivalent of FAD is noncovalently bound per dimer in all ETFs except the M. elsdenii protein, which binds two FAD molecules per dimer. FAD is the only oxidation-reduction center in these proteins, although the ETFs from human, pig, P. denitrificans, and M. methylotrophus also contain one equivalent of AMP of unknown function (9.Roberts D.L.

Unlike most flavoproteins, which function as two-electron carriers, most ETFs are thought to be one-electron carriers, cycling between the oxidized and anionic flavin semiquinone (1.Thorpe C. Muller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. II. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 471-486Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it has been shown that mammalian ETFs and ETF from P. denitrificans can become fully reduced to the hydroquinone upon dithionite or photochemical reductions, although the reduction from semiquinone to hydroquinone is quite sluggish (4.Husain M. Steenkamp D.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 6.Husain M. Steenkamp D.J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 709-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Hall C.L.

Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6830-6839Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). ETF from M. methylotrophus W3A1 is the physiological electron acceptor of trimethylamine dehydrogenase (TMADH), an iron-sulfur-containing flavoprotein that catalyzes the oxidative demethylation of trimethylamine (8.Steenkamp D.J. Gallup M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4086-4089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Husain M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 188: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 16.McIntire W.S. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 188: 250-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The protein is a 63-kDa heterodimer with a 33.7-kDa α-subunit and a 28.9-kDa β-subunit (17.Chen D. Swenson R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32120-32130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); it contains one equivalent each of FAD and AMP per dimer. Unlike mammalian ETFs, which can accept reducing equivalents from a variety of electron donors, including at least nine different dehydrogenases in the mitochondria (18.Frerman F.E. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1987; 16: 416-418Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar), W3A1ETF is highly specific for TMADH and cannot be reduced by other dehydrogenases from M. methylotrophus, such as methylamine dehydrogenase and methanol dehydrogenase (8.Steenkamp D.J. Gallup M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4086-4089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or by dehydrogenases from other organisms (19.Davidson V.L. Husain M. Neher J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 812-817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During turnover, W3A1 ETF receives a single reducing equivalent from the 4Fe/4S center of TMADH: the anionic semiquinone form of the protein rapidly accumulates in both steady-state (8.Steenkamp D.J. Gallup M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4086-4089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Davidson V.L. Husain M. Neher J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 812-817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and rapid reaction experiments (20.Huang L. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23958-23965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). ETFs are distinct from most other flavoproteins in that the (anionic) semiquinone form is extremely stable (1.Thorpe C. Muller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. II. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 471-486Google Scholar). In the case of W3A1 ETF, even strong reducing reagents such as dithionite and deazariboflavin radical are unable to reduce the protein to its two-electron reduced hydroquinone form (8.Steenkamp D.J. Gallup M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4086-4089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Davidson V.L. Husain M. Neher J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 812-817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Full reduction of W3A1 ETF has only been achieved by electrochemical means using reduced methylviologen as a redox mediator, with an equilibration time of 6–12 h required for the transfer of the second electron (21.Byron C.M. Stankovich M.T. Husain M. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8582-8587Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The mid-point reduction potentials obtained for the FAD quinone/semiquinone and semiquinone/hydroquinone couples in this study were 196 mV and −197 mV, respectively. The unexceptional reduction potential for the semiquinone/hydroquinone couple (−197 mV) indicates that the barrier to full reduction of W3A1 ETF is kinetic rather than thermodynamic in nature, as reduction cannot be achieved by either sodium dithionite (−530 mV) or photochemically generated deazariboflavin radical (−650 mV). These reduction potentials indicate, however, that electron transfer from neither the FMN cofactor (E 0′FMN/FMNsq = 44 mV;E 0′FMNsq/FMNhq = 36 mV) nor the 4Fe/4S center (E 0′ = 100 mV) (22.Barber M.J. Pollock V. Spence J.T. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 657-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) of TMADH to the ETF semiquinone is thermodynamically favorable. The above discussion notwithstanding, in examining the reaction of the TMADH·ETF protein complex with trimethylamine, we have found unexpectedly that W3A1 ETF can be fully reduced to the hydroquinone within the complex. Dithionite titration of the complex indicates that a total of five electrons are taken up, consistent with full reduction of ETF along with TMADH in the complex. Full reduction of W3A1 ETF takes place via the 4Fe/4S center, as reduced phenylhydrazine-inactivated TMADH (in which the enzyme flavin has been covalently modified and rendered redox-inert; Ref. 23.Nagy N. Kenny W.C. Singer T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2684-2688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) remains capable of reducing ETF from the semiquinone to the hydroquinone state to a substantial degree. The results suggest that the oxidation-reduction properties of ETF are perturbed upon binding to TMADH, and specifically that the apparent kinetic barrier for reduction to the ETF hydroquinone has been overcome in the protein-protein complex. Electron transfer from TMADH to ETF has been studied previously by following the reaction of reduced TMADH with oxidized ETF, yielding a limiting rate constant of 172 s−1 and a dissociation constant for TMADHred and ETFox of 10 mm (20.Huang L. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23958-23965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The reaction of substrate-reduced TMADH with the artificial electron acceptor ferricenium hexafluorophosphate has also been studied (24.Wilson E.K. Mathews F.S. Packman L.C. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2584-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The limiting rate constant for electron transfer as a function of temperature was analyzed by electron transfer theory, and an electron tunneling pathway distance of approximately 13 Å was obtained, which correlates with the shortest pathway measured from the 4Fe/4S center to the protein surface of TMADH. This effective electron transfer distance was further refined to 11.3 Å by analyzing the reaction of dithionite reduced phenylhydrazine-inactivated TMADH with ETF; based on the x-ray crystal structure of TMADH and the kinetically determined electron tunneling distance, it was proposed that electrons are transferred to the surface of TMADH at or close to residue Tyr-442 (25.Wilson E.K. Huang L. Sutcliffe M.J. Mathews F.S. Hille R. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The implication is that ETF docks close to Tyr-442 in forming the protein-protein complex. Kinetic studies of TMADH mutant proteins (Y442F, Y442L, and Y442G) have shown that Tyr-442 indeed plays a significant role in facilitating electron transfer from TMADH to ETF (25.Wilson E.K. Huang L. Sutcliffe M.J. Mathews F.S. Hille R. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Given the observations described above, a structural model for the TMADH·ETF complex has been proposed (26.Chohan K.K. Scrutton N.S. Sutcliffe M.J. Protein Pept. Lett. 1998; 5: 231-236Google Scholar). On the basis of this computer-modeled structure, a substantial conformational change of W3A1 ETF during complex formation must take place for efficient electron transfer from the 4Fe/4S center of TMADH to the FAD cofactor of ETF (26.Chohan K.K. Scrutton N.S. Sutcliffe M.J. Protein Pept. Lett. 1998; 5: 231-236Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that such a conformational change alters the environment of the FAD binding pocket and modulates the reduction potential of the cofactor. In light of the present work, it appears likely that the proposed conformational change indeed occurs, altering the oxidation-reduction properties of ETF such that its full reduction can take place. Mono- and dipotassium phosphate, sodium pyrophosphate, trimethylamine hydrochloride (TMA), benzyl viologen, and phenylhydrazine hydrochloride were obtained from Sigma. Sodium dithionite was from Virginia Chemicals. Ferricenium hexafluorophosphate was prepared as described by Lehman and Thorpe (27.Lehman T.C. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10594-10602Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). M. methylotrophus W3A1 was grown on TMA as sole carbon source, and both TMADH and ETF were purified as described previously (20.Huang L. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23958-23965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 28.Jang, M.-H., Basran, J., Scrutton, N. S., and Hille, R. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. in pressGoogle Scholar). Concentrated protein stock solutions were stored in liquid nitrogen with 15% glycerol added. All reactions were performed in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at room temperature unless specified otherwise. Protein samples for the experiments were prepared in the following way. For TMADH, the thawed, concentrated enzyme stock solution was passed through a Sephadex G-25 column to remove glycerol and the concentration determined from the absorbance at 442 nm of oxidized enzyme (using an extinction coefficient of 27.3 mm−1 cm−1; Ref. 29.Kasprzak A.A. Papas E.J. Steenkamp D.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the case of ETF, which is partially reduced as isolated, the protein was reoxidized with excess ferricenium hexafluorophosphate and then passed through a Sephadex G-25 column to remove residual oxidant. The concentration of ETF was determined from the 438-nm absorbance of oxidized protein using an extinction coefficient of 11.3 mm−1 cm−1 (8.Steenkamp D.J. Gallup M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4086-4089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When necessary, protein solutions were concentrated using Amicon Centricon-30 and Centricon-10 concentrators for TMADH and ETF, respectively. The complex of TMADH with ETF was prepared simply by mixing high concentrations of the two proteins in 1:1 stoichiometry, given the small value expected for the K d between the oxidized forms of the two proteins (a K d of 10 μm has been determined kinetically for complex formation between reduced TMADH and oxidized ETF; Ref. 20.Huang L. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23958-23965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Theoretically, up to millimolar concentrations of the two proteins can be used to ensure nearly complete formation of the protein complex. However, the maximum concentrations used in the experiments were limited by the 1-cm light path of the optical cell and the non-linearity of Beer's law at high optical density. Therefore, 100 μm amounts of each protein were used in most cases, which affords 73% complex formation (based on a K d of 10 μm). At 35 μm for both proteins, on the other hand, it is estimated that about 59% of the proteins will be present as complex. Phenylhydrazine-inactivated TMADH was prepared based on the methods described previously (23.Nagy N. Kenny W.C. Singer T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2684-2688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Kasprzak A.A. Papas E.J. Steenkamp D.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). 50 μmTMADH in 0.1 m sodium pyrophosphate buffer, pH 7.7, was incubated with 2 mm phenylhydrazine at 30 °C for 4 h. The solution was then concentrated using Amicon Centricon-30 and passed through a Sephadex G-25 column to remove excess phenylhydrazine. The concentration of TMADH thus obtained was determined using an extinction coefficient of 21.4 mm−1cm−1 at 410 nm (29.Kasprzak A.A. Papas E.J. Steenkamp D.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). UV-visible spectra were recorded at room temperature using a Hewlett-Packard 8452A single-beam diode array spectrophotometer. In the reaction of TMADH·ETF with TMA, 300 μl of the TMADH·ETF complex solution (100 μm each) was placed in a 1-mm light path cell and the spectrum recorded. 10 μl of a 18.6 mm TMA solution was then added to the sample to obtain a final concentration of 600 μm. The cell was quickly mixed after the addition of TMA and spectra recorded every minute for 10 min. Spectral change associated with the initial reduction of the protein complex as well as spectral change occurring subsequent to the addition of TMA were obtained by simple spectral subtraction methods using Hewlett-Packard software. For the reaction of three-electron reduced TMADH (TMADH3e−) with ETF semiquinone (ETFsq), protein solutions were prepared in the following way; a 70 μm TMADH solution containing 0.5 mm benzyl viologen (to prevent formation of bisulfite adduct at the FMN site of TMADH during dithionite titration; Ref. 30.Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15244-15252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was placed in a tonometer, made anaerobic by repeated evacuation and flushing with O2-free argon, then titrated to three-electron reduced level with a concentrated anaerobic sodium dithionite solution prepared in the same buffer. A solution of ETF (70 μm) was placed in another tonometer, made anaerobic using the procedures described above, and titrated with sodium dithionite solution to the one-electron reduced level. 1.2 ml of each protein solution was then transferred into separate compartments of a split-cell cuvette (0.5-cm light path for each compartment) fitted with a rubber septum (which had been previously made anaerobic by flushing with O2-free argon) using a long-needle Hamilton syringe. The spectrum of the sample with TMADH3e− and ETFsq in separate compartments was recorded; the split cell was then tipped, and the two solutions were mixed well and another spectrum recorded. Spectra of the samples were then measured every 20 s for 15 min. For the reaction of reduced phenylhydrazine-inactivated TMADH with ETFsq, the two protein solutions were prepared in a similar way and the experiment performed essentially as described above. In this case, one compartment of the split cell contained reduced phenylhydrazine-inactivated TMADH rather than fully reduced TMADH. The spectral change associated with binding of oxidized ETF and TMADH was obtained in the following way; 1.2 ml of 80 μmoxidized ETF and TMADH were placed into separate compartments of a split cell cuvette. A spectrum of the sample was recorded (before mixing). The two solutions were then mixed thoroughly and another spectrum recorded (after mixing). The difference spectrum ((after mixing) − (before mixing)) was then obtained by spectral subtraction. A 1-ml solution of TMADH·ETF (100 μm each) was placed in a tonometer equipped with a 4-mm light path cuvette and made anaerobic by repeated evacuation and flushing with O2-free argon. The protein solution was then titrated with a concentrated solution of sodium dithionite prepared in anaerobic buffer. The spectrum of the sample was recorded after each addition of sodium dithionite (spectra were continuously taken after adding the reductant until the system reached a new equilibrium; the spectrum of the sample at equilibrium required less than 1 min at the beginning and about 5 min toward the end of titration, and was used for the final plot), and the titration was considered complete when no further spectral change was observed with further addition of the reducing agent. After the titration of the protein complex was complete, the same dithionite solution was then calibrated immediately by titration against a 1-ml solution of anaerobic FMN of known concentration to determine the reductive strength of the sodium dithionite solution. The A 370 from the titration with the TMADH·ETF complex was then plotted versus the number of electrons added. The experiment was repeated three times, and the total number of electrons taken up obtained were averaged. Since the titration of FMN was performed after the titration of the protein solution, the values obtained are expected to slightly underestimate the electron uptake of the system due to slow oxidation of the dithionite stock solution. The spectral changes associated with the reaction of the TMADH·ETF complex with TMA are shown in Fig.1. 2This reaction was necessarily performed under aerobic conditions, as the 1-mm light path cuvette that had to be used (owing to the high concentrations of proteins used) had an open top and it was not technically feasible to make it anaerobic. We note that both reduced TMADH and ETF are unusually stable to air-reoxidation, however, with half-lives for the reaction of approximately 1 h. In particular, it has been shown previously that the reaction of TMADH with TMA (in the absence of ETF) exhibits identical kinetics under aerobic and anaerobic conditions (24.Wilson E.K. Mathews F.S. Packman L.C. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2584-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 25.Wilson E.K. Huang L. Sutcliffe M.J. Mathews F.S. Hille R. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For these reasons, the effect of O2 on the present reaction is expected to be negligible. That this is the case is evident in the sustained reduction of the enzyme that is observed over the duration of the present experiments. All spectral changes that are observed, even those on the slowest (seconds) time scale, are associated with reduction of the enzyme-ETF complex, and not its reoxidation.The spectral change observed within 10 s after addition of TMA to the complex (Fig. 1 B) is consistent with reduction of the complex by two equivalents of TMA to give the four-electron reduced state, with three electrons required for full reduction of TMADH and one for reducing ETF to the semiquinone form. Subsequently, however, an additional spectral change is observed. This slower spectral change is shown in Fig. 1 C and has features, in particular the substantial absorbance decrease at 370 nm reflecting loss of the anionic semiquinone, that suggest further reduction of ETF semiquinone to the hydroquinone state has occurred. To investigate whether ETF can indeed be reduced fully to the flavin hydroquinone within the TMADH·ETF complex, a quantitative titration with sodium dithionite was performed to determine the total number of reducing equivalents taken up by the protein complex. The absorption spectra of the protein complex in the course of the titration are shown in Fig. 2 A. A plot of the absorbance change at 370 nm (following the accumulation and subsequent decay of the anionic semiquinone of both TMADH and ETF)versus the number of reducing equivalents added is shown in Fig. 2 B, where it is evident that approximately five electrons are required for full reduction of the complex and that at completion of the titration the absorption at 370 nm, which accumulates transiently in the course of the titration, has been lost, undoubtedly reflecting reduction of the ETF semiquinone on to the hydroquinone. The experiment was performed in triplicate, and the average electron uptake of the complex found to be 4.7 ± 0.12 e−. Assuming aK d for binding of the oxidized forms of the two proteins comparable to the value of 10 μm determined kinetically for complex formation between reduced TMADH and oxidized ETF, it is estimated that about 73% of the proteins would form complex under the present experimental conditions. Therefore, a value of 4.7 electrons actually agrees very well with the fact that not all of the protein molecules have formed complex and only those in the complex were able to take up an additional electron. Control experiments were also performed to ensure that the FAD cofactor did not dissociate from ETF in the course of dithionite titration, and this was found not to be the case. 3After the dithionite titration was complete, the reduced sample was loaded to a small Sephadex G-25 column to determine whether a fraction of free FAD was present. If FAD had dissociated from the protein, it would be rapidly reoxidized by O2 during gel chromatography and a bright yellow band would appear. The column was also illuminated with UV light to detect any trace amount of FAD, which is highly fluorescent. No yellow fraction or fluorescence was observed for the dithionite-reduced protein sample during the whole process of chromatography, indicating that the FAD cofactor did not dissociate from ETF in the course of dithionite titration. The results of the dithionite titration clearly demonstrate that the TMADH·ETF complex can indeed take up a total of five electrons and that ETF can be reduced fully to FAD hydroquinone when it is in complex with TMADH. To investigate whether full reduction of ETF within the TMADH·ETF complex occurs by electron transfer from TMADH rather than direct reduction by sodium dithionite, the following experiment was performed. Equal volumes of 70 μm TMADH3e− and 70 μmETFsq were placed into separate compartments of an anaerobic split-cell cuvette and the spectrum recorded. The two solutions were then mixed thoroughly, and the spectrum of the sample was measured every 20 s for 15 min (the reaction was found to go to completion in approximately 10 min). The spectra of the solution before mixing and upon completion of the reaction are shown in Fig.3 A, and the ((15 min after mixing) − (before mixing)) difference spectrum in Fig.3 B. Since the spectra for TMADH3e−, TMADH2e−, ETFsq, and ETFhq are known, the expected spectral change associated with transfer of one electron from TMADH3e− to ETFsq to give TMADH2e− (containing FMNhq and oxidized 4Fe/4S center) 4At pH 7.0, the electron distribution in two-electron reduced TMADH favors formation of FMNhq and oxidized 4Fe/4S center (31.Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22196-22207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, the 4Fe/4S center remains predominantly oxidized after transferring one electron to the FAD of ETF since electron transfer from FMNhq to the 4Fe/4S center is under prototropic control and essentially prevented at pH 7.0. and ETFhq can be calculated, and is shown in Fig.3 C. From a comparison of panels B andC, it is evident that the experimentally obtained difference spectrum agrees well with that calculated from the known spectral properties of TMADH and ETF, 5The slight difference seen between the observed and calculated difference spectra is most likely a result of the minor spectral perturbation associated with binding of ETF to TMADH, which is known to occur when the oxidized form of the two proteins bind to each other.indicating that electron transfer from TMADH3e−(presumably via its 4Fe/4S center; see below) to ETFsq was achieved. From the magnitude of the spectral change at 370 nm, it is estimated that electron transfer went to only 30% completion under the present experimental conditions, reflecting an internal equilibrium of the electron distribution between TMADH3e−·ETFsq and TMADH2e−·ETFhq. It is known that in the course of turnover, reducing equivalents are transferred from TMADH to ETF exclusively via the 4Fe/4S site of the former to give the ETF anionic semiquinone (20.Huang L. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23958-23965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To confirm that this is also the case for full reduction of ETF to the hydroquinone level, phenylhydrazine-inactivated TMADH was used in an experiment analogous to that described above with TMADH3e−.

W., Wang, A. M., Martinez, J. M., and Maley, F. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 47–51) to be similar in size, properties, and amino acid composition to the T2-phage-induced deaminase. Neither enzyme is active in the absence of dCTP or its natural activator, 5-hydroxymethyl-dCTP. However, on changing the arginine (Arg) at residue 115 of the T4-deaminase to either a glutamate (R115E) or a glutamine (R115Q), the resulting mutant enzymes were active in the absence of dCTP, with each mutant possessing a turnover number or k cat that is about 15% that of the wild-type deaminase. When compared on the basis of specific activity, however, the mutants are about 40–50% of the wild-type (WT)-enzyme's specific activity. Molecular weight analysis on the wild-type and mutant deaminases using HPLC size exclusion chromatography revealed that the wild-type deaminase was basically a hexamer, particularly in the presence of dCTP, regardless of the extent of dilution. Under similar conditions, R115E remained a dimer, whereas R115Q and F112A varied from hexamers to dimers particularly at concentrations normally present in the assay solution. Activity measurements appear to support the conclusion that the hexameric form of the enzyme is activated by dCTP, while the dimer is not. Another feature emphasizing the difference between the WT and mutant deaminases was observed on their denaturation-renaturation in EDTA, which revealed the mutants to be restored to 50% of their original activities with the WT deaminase only marginally restored.

The extent of activation was found to be regulated by dTTP, an end product inhibitor of the phage-induced enzyme pathway inEscherichia coli. 15-Hydroxymethyl-dCTP is the most probable activator of the T4-phage deaminase, since it is incorporated into the phage DNA in place of dCTP. The latter is broken down to dCMP by a phage-induced enzyme and subsequently hydroxymethylated by another phage-induced enzyme. Because of its commercial availability dCTP is used in place of 5-hydroxymethyl-dCTP.

The cooperative nature of this ligand-protein interaction suggested that the phage and eukaryotic deaminases are oligomeric proteins, a hallmark of allosteric proteins (6.Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6129) Google Scholar), and each was found subsequently to be composed of six identicalM r 20,000 subunits. We will demonstrate in the present study that on mutating Arg115 of T4-phage dCMP deaminase to a Glu, the resulting enzyme is highly active in the absence of dCTP-Mg2+ and contrary to the WT2-deaminase exists as a dimer. A comparison of the protein structure and enzyme activity of R115E with other mutants (R115Q, F112A) and the WT deaminase will also be presented. High purity dCMP, dCTP, and dTTP were purchased from Sigma. Other chemicals and reagents used for bacterial cell growth, buffers, enzyme purification and assay, and polyacrylamide electrophoresis were of reagent grade and purchased from the following commercial sources: Sigma, Fisher, Mallinckrodt Baker, Inc., (Paris, KY), or Life Technologies, Inc. Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). DE52 and cellulose phosphate were obtained from Schleicher and Schuell, Inc. T4-dCMP deaminase mutants were generated using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. The plasmid, pET3c-CD5 (7.Moore J.T. Uppal A. Maley F. Maley G.F. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), containing the entire 581-base pair coding region of the wild-type deaminase enzyme was the DNA template used in the QuikChange polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis. The codon CGA encoding arginine 115 of the deaminase was changed to GAG (glutamic acid), or CAG (glutamine), to generate the enzyme mutants R115E, or R115Q, respectively. DNA sequence analysis verified that the changed codon sequence at amino acid position 115 in the mutant genes was the only change made in the entire coding region. Wild-type or mutated pET3c-CD5 plasmids were used to transform E. coliBL21(DE3)/pLysS cells (Novagen, Madison WI). Wild-type and mutant deaminases were overexpressed from a pET3c-CD5 transformed BL21(DE3)/pLysS host cells as described earlier (7.Moore J.T. Uppal A. Maley F. Maley G.F. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), with the following modifications; bacterial cultures (5 ml) were grown overnight at 37 °C in tryptone-phosphate medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin or carbenicillin, and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Stationary phase cultures were added to Fernbach flasks containing 500 ml of the above medium and were shaken (250 rpm) at 30 °C to anA 600 of 0.6. After adding isopropropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mm the flasks were shaken for another 4–6 h before harvesting the cells by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer, recentrifuged, and stored at −70 °C. All purification steps, modified from an earlier procedure (8.Maley G.F. Guarino D.V. Maley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 931-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were carried out at 4 °C unless stated otherwise. The thawed cell pellet derived from 0.5 liter of induced cells was resuspended in 24 ml of ice-cold TME (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA) containing 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1.0 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. Resuspended cells were disrupted using a model VC600 Vibra Cell sonicator (Sonics & Materials, Inc., Danbury, CT) equipped with a 12 mm diameter probe (duty cycle set at 80% with an output control setting of 9). Cells were sonicated five times, 30 s per sonication, in an alcohol/ice bath. The disrupted cell mixture was centrifuged for 30 min at 34,500 × g and the pellet discarded. The supernatant fraction contained about 2500 R115E units of deaminase activity with a specific activity of 10 units/mg of protein. Ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant fraction to 35% saturation, and the mixture was stirred for 20–30 min, after which the turbid solution was centrifuged for 20 min at 34,500 × g and the resulting pellet discarded. Ammonium sulfate was then added to the supernatant fraction to 80% saturation and the mixture stirred for 30 min, at which time the precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation for 30 min at 34,500 × g. The protein pellet was dissolved in 10–15 ml of Buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 10% (w/v) ethylene glycol, 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA) and dialyzed overnight against two 1.0-liter changes of Buffer A. The dialysate was sonicated three times at 20 s each in an ice bath using a 3-mm diameter probe (50% duty cycle; with an output control setting of 5) to reduce its viscosity and then loaded onto a 2.5 × 14-cm DE52 anion exchange column equilibrated with Buffer A. The DE52 column was washed with 3 column volumes of Buffer A (or until the OD280 was at background levels), then with 3 column volumes of Buffer A + 0.1m NaCl. Most of the R115E and R115Q deaminase activity eluted in the 0.1 m NaCl wash, while the wild-type deaminase eluted with 0.2 m NaCl. Fractions containing the deaminase peak were pooled, concentrated in an Amicon (Amicon Division, W. R. Grace & Co., Beverly, MA) ultrafiltration device (10 kDa cut-off filter), and dialyzed over night against two 1.0-liter changes of Buffer B (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.1, 10% ethylene glycol, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT2). Although most of the wild-type and R115Q enzymes usually precipitated from solution during the course of the dialysis, R115E remained in solution. The precipitates were centrifuged for 30 min at 34,500 × g, and the pellets were dissolved in 0.15–0.25m potassium phosphate, pH 7.1, 10% ethylene glycol, 2 mm DTT, and then diluted in 10% ethylene glycol, 2 mm DTT until the phosphate concentration was about 20 mm. The dissolved protein was applied to a 1.5 × 12-cm cellulose phosphate cation exchange column equilibrated with Buffer B, which was then washed with 3–5 column volumes of Buffer B, followed by 4–5 column volumes of Buffer B + 50 mmphosphate. Most of the R115E and R115Q deaminase activities eluted in the 50 mm phosphate wash, in contrast to the wild-type deaminase, which required 0.2 m phosphate for elution. About 1500 units of R115E were recovered, usually with a specific activity of 90–100 units/mg of protein. The enzyme eluates were concentrated in an Amicon as above and when stored at 0–4 °C for extended periods 2-mercaptoethanol was added to 0.1 m. For longer periods of storage the enzyme was precipitated by addition of solid ammonium sulfate to 80% saturation and the centrifuged protein was frozen at −40 °C. Enzyme purity at this stage was usually >95% as determined by Coomassie blue staining of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels following electrophoresis of the purified protein samples. Measurement of enzyme activity and the quantitation of protein in purified deaminase preparations were performed at 30 °C as described earlier (9.Moore J.T. Silversmith R.E. Maley G.F. Maley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2288-2291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay solution in which deaminase activity was measured contained 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm dCMP, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, with or without 20 μm dCTP, depending on the enzyme to be assayed. One unit of activity refers to the deamination of 1 μmol of dCMP/min under the conditions of the assay. Specific activity refers to units of activity/mg of protein. dCMP deaminase activity was measured at 5, 10, 50, 100, 250, and 500 μm dCMP in the presence and absence of dCTP. When MgCl2 was omitted from the assay solution, wild-type enzyme activity was negligible at 0.5 mm dCMP. Substrate K m andV max values were calculated for the WT dCMP deaminase and the R115Q, and R115E mutants by nonlinear fitting of the kinetic data (catalytic velocities and substrate concentrations) to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the Enzfitter program of Robin Leatherbarrow (version 1.05). Due to the relatively high turnover of the WT deaminase (∼2.5 × 104 mol of dCMP deaminated min−1 mol−1 hexamer), enzyme samples were routinely diluted to 15–35 μg/ml protein with a solution of 0.2m potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 10% ethylene glycol, 0.1m 2-mercaptoethanol, and 20 μm dCTP, from which aliquots were removed for the measurement of enzyme activity. One microliter of purified R115E (8.5 μg), R115Q (10 μg), or wild-type enzyme (3.5 μg) was diluted 1:10 in a solution of 0.2 mpotassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 6 m guanidine HCl, 0.1m 2-mercaptoethanol, ± 1.0 mm EDTA. Control samples were diluted in the absence of denaturant and EDTA. After incubating at room temperature for 4 h, the guanidine concentration was lowered by adding a 49-fold volume of 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.1 m2-mercaptoethanol, ± 1.0 mm EDTA (no EDTA was added to control samples) to allow enzyme renaturation. At 0-, 10-, 20-, 30-, and 40 min intervals after renaturation, 10-μl aliquots of enzyme were assayed for dCMP deaminase activity. Time point assays of WT enzyme were conducted in the presence of 20 μm dCTP; no dCTP was present in assays for the mutant enzymes. Enzyme samples were analyzed at room temperature using a Waters Protein-Pak 300SW column (8 x 300 mm) integrated into a Waters HPLC system (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) consisting of a model 625 LC, a model 996 Photodiode Array Detector, and a model 717 plus Autosampler. The data were collected and processed (i.e. peak retention time, height, area, etc.) using the Millennium version 2.00 software provided with the HPLC system. Enzyme samples were eluted isocratically in 50 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 2.0 mm DTT ± 20 μmdCTP at either 0.4 ml/min or 0.8 ml/min. Protein elution was detected at both 280 and 229 nm. The injection loop limited the sample volume to 200 μl (maximum). M r values of WT deaminase, R115E, R115Q, and F112A were obtained by injecting 80 μg of each protein in 20 μl onto the column. Molecular weight standard proteins (Sigma) used to calibrate the column were: α-amylase (200,000), alcohol dehydrogenase (150,000), bovine serum albumin (66,000), carbonic anhydrase (29,000), and horse heart cytochrome c(12,400). The effect of replacing Arg115 in WT T4-dCMP deaminase with either a glutamine (R115Q) or a glutamate (R115E) residue was similar in that neither enzyme, unlike the WT deaminase, required dCTP and Mg2+ for activity to be observed. Omission of dCTP yielded only marginal activity for the WT enzyme as is evident in the first column in Fig. 1. When Mg2+ was omitted too, the enzyme was essentially inactive. In enzyme assays where dCTP was absent from the assay solution, activity was observed immediately upon the addition of R115E or R115Q, as shown earlier for F112A (10.Moore J.T. Ciesla J.M. Changchien L.-M. Maley G.F. Maley F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2104-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), whereas wild-type enzyme activity could not be detected until dCTP was added to the reaction cuvette (data not shown). In the case of R115Q, it should be noted that while this mutant was about as active as R115E in the absence of dCTP (Table I), its activity was increased by 30–40% in the presence of 20 μm dCTP (Fig. 1). When 0.1 mm dTTP was included in the WT deaminase assay the enzyme was inhibited by 20%, with no effect on the mutants. However, in the presence of 0.3 mm dTTP the WT deaminase was inhibited by about 90%, while the mutants were inhibited by about 30% (Fig. 1). Thus, although some inhibition of the mutants can be effected by dTTP, they appear to be much less sensitive to inhibition by dTTP than the WT deaminase, consistent with their lesser sensitivity to dCTP.Table IKinetic characterization of T4-dCMP deaminase and mutantsEnzymeK maK m and V max were obtained from nonlinear fitting of data to the Michaelis-Menten equation.

Open table in a new tab To determine whether the kinetic properties of the mutants differed,V max and K m values of each of the enzymes was evaluated in the presence and absence of dCTP using a nonlinear fitting of the kinetic data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Table I reveals that the maximal activity (V max) of R115Q and R115E was about 45–55% that of the WT deaminase when measured in the absence of dCTP. At the concentration of dCTP normally employed for the WT deaminase assay (20 μm) the activity of R115E was perhaps slightly inhibited, while that of R115Q was increased by 30–40% (data not shown). A similar type of comparative analysis of enzyme activity with the WT deaminase in the presence and absence of dCTP could not be conducted due to the fact this enzyme is basically inactive in the absence of dCTP. The higherV max (about 2-fold) of the WT enzyme relative to R115Q and R115E could be due in part to its 4–5-fold lowerK m relative to that of the mutants. When the mutants and WT deaminase are compared on the basis ofk cat, the differences become even more exaggerated (Table I), since M r values become a factor in this parameter, and as indicated below the WT enzyme is most likely a hexamer, while the mutants appear to be in their dimeric state during the course of the assay. The differences are even more exaggerated when their specificity constants (k cat/K m) are compared (22 s−1 μm−1 for the WT deaminaseversus 0.60 for the mutants). Earlier studies with the chick embryo (4.Maley F. Maley G.F. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1970; 8: 55-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and T2-phage deaminases (11.Maley G.F. MacColl R. Maley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 940-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicated that under conditions of dilution or inhibition by dTTP the enzyme was reduced in size. With the WT and mutant deaminases available to us now, and the improvement inM r determinations via size exclusion HPLC, a more careful evaluation of the apparent M rvalues of these proteins was undertaken using the protocol described under “Experimental Procedures.” A plot of the elution times of the WT T4-deaminase, R115E, R115Q, and F112A, versus logM r using the standards indicated under “Experimental Procedures” yielded the following respectiveM r values, 127,000, 44,300, 124,500, and 111,900 (data not shown). It should be indicated that 20 μm dCTP was included in the elution buffer. Considering that the estimatedM r of a subunit of WT T4-phage-dCMP deaminase is 21,200 (12.Maley G.F. Duceman B.W. Wang A.-M. Martinez J. Maley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 47-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), R115E would be a dimer, WT T4-dCMP deaminase and R115Q would be hexamers, and F112A would most probably be a hexamer. However, while the elution times of WT deaminase and R115E did not vary with protein concentration over a 400-fold dilution (4 to 0.001 mg/ml) in the presence or absence of dCTP (TableII), that of R115Q was affected dramatically, indicating that it had undergone a marked change in its oligomeric structure on dilution. This effect is clearly seen in TableII and Fig. 2 d, where R115Q appears to be mostly a hexamer, but also contains a component that elutes as a dimer. When the protein was diluted from 4 to 0.5 mg/ml, the dimer increased somewhat (Fig. 2 e), but on further dilution to about 0.04 mg/ml the major peak by far was the dimer (Fig.2 f). Complete transformation to the dimer was observed to occur in the presence or absence of dCTP at 1 μg/ml (Table II). Under similar conditions, WT T4-dCMP deaminase retained its hexameric structure (Fig. 2, a–c), and R115E remained as a dimer (Fig. 2, g–i). In the case of F112A (Table II), this protein's elution time suggested it to behave anomalously in that itsM r was about 113,000 at 4 mg/ml, which decreased to about 63,000 at 0.04 mg/ml whether in the presence of dCTP or not (data not shown). The broadness of the elution profile in the latter case suggests the presence of multiple species, but on further dilution to 1 μg/ml, however, F112A clearly eluted as a dimer (Table II). It should be emphasized that at the concentrations employed in the assay for each protein, the only one that retained its hexameric structure, regardless of the presence or absence of dCTP or extent of dilution, was the WT deaminase. R115Q appeared to retain much of its hexameric structure in the presence of dCTP until diluted to 1 μg/ml, where like F112A it eluted as a dimer. However, in the absence of dCTP, R115Q migrated with an M r of 60,000 at the higher levels of protein, but on further dilution (1 μg/ml) it migrated as a dimer (Table II). Since the protein concentrations given in Table IIare those prior to injection onto the column, it should be noted that even further dilution occurs during the process of elution.Table IIEffect of protein concentration on molecular weight of WT and mutant dCMP deaminaseProtein concentrationWTR115ER115QF112Amg/ml−dCTP4.0119,00044,50059,100113,000.5122,00043,30050,100105,000.001112,00041,60039,90038,200+dCTPa20 μm in assay solution.4.0125,00 45,400 118,000b80/20 mixture of hexamer/dimer.103,0000.5115,00 41,600 114,000c70/30 mixture of hexamer/dimer. 96,9000.001110,00 41,00039,800 38,700See “Experimental Procedures” for M rdeterminations.a 20 μm in assay solution.b 80/20 mixture of hexamer/dimer.c 70/30 mixture of hexamer/dimer.

It is of interest to note that R115Q, like the WT deaminase, was markedly activated by dCTP when its hexameric form was assayed following isolation from the sizing column. The extent of activation was at least five times the activity of the enzyme in the absence of dCTP. By contrast the column-isolated dimer, like R115E, showed little if any activation by dCTP. A similar result was obtained with theM r 60,000 form of R115Q that was isolated in the absence of dCTP. However, as indicated in Fig. 1, R115Q when assayed directly showed only a 30–40% activation by dCTP, which suggests that when the two forms of R115Q are not separated prior to assaying, the dimer predominates. Previous work (9.Moore J.T. Silversmith R.E. Maley G.F. Maley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2288-2291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in our laboratory demonstrated that when T4-phage-dCMP deaminase was denatured in the presence of 6m guanidine HCl, almost complete restoration of activity could be obtained on removal of the denaturant by dilution or dialysis. Similar studies were conducted with the R115E and R115Q mutants and comparable with the earlier WT-deaminase denaturation-renaturation results, their respective activities were restored with time (Fig.3 A). It is of interest to note that the WT-deaminase, when refolded, was even more active than prior to the denaturation-renaturation process, which indicates that the renatured enzyme's structure is more supportive of enzyme activity than that before denaturation. However, when the denaturation of WT-enzyme was conducted in the presence of EDTA to remove its two resident Zn2+ atoms/subunit (9.Moore J.T. Silversmith R.E. Maley G.F. Maley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2288-2291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), little activity could be restored on denaturant removal (Fig. 3 B), even when Zn2+ was added to the renaturation solution. By contrast, when similar studies were conducted with R115E and R115Q, 54 and 60% of their respective original activities were detected 40 min after renaturation (Fig. 3 B). Since our initial observation that dCMP deaminase, at least in eukaryotes, is an allosteric enzyme activated by dCTP and inhibited by dTTP (13.Maley G.F. Maley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3311-3312Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), a major objective has been to determine how these effectors manage to regulate this enzyme. The T4- (and also T2- and T6-) phage dCMP deaminase may not be considered a classical example of an allosteric enzyme (6.Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6129) Google Scholar), since it does not show kinetic cooperativity, or activity for that matter, in the presence of substrate alone. However, in the presence of dCTP and Mg2+ the enzyme assumes an active conformation and demonstrates a heterotrophic interaction between dCTP and dTTP that is sigmoidal in nature (8.Maley G.F. Guarino D.V. Maley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 931-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the phage deaminase could be considered a unique example of an allosteric enzyme, one that is related to its eukaryote counterpart, but differing somewhat in the way its six subunits interact in the presence of ligands, relative to the manner in which the six subunits of the chick embryo (4.Maley F. Maley G.F. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1970; 8: 55-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) or human deaminase interact (14.Maley G.F. Lobo A.P. Maley F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1162: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The photofixation of dTTP to the T2-deaminase (15.Maley F. Maley G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11876-11878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a process inhibited by dCTP, suggests that the regulators probably bind to the same site or to sites that are in proximity to one another. Subsequent studies revealed that dTTP photofixes to Phe112 in the T4-phage enzyme and that mutating this residue to an Ala results not only in the loss of photofixation, but in a partial loss in the enzyme's dCTP requirement for activity (10.Moore J.T. Ciesla J.M. Changchien L.-M. Maley G.F. Maley F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2104-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In contrast to the WT-deaminase, F112A is active in the absence of dCTP, but it possesses only about 10% as much activity. The F112A activity is increased greatly by the presence of 100–300 μm dCTP, reflecting this mutants greatly reduced binding of dCTP (10.Moore J.T. Ciesla J.M. Changchien L.-M. Maley G.F. Maley F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2104-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The fact that dCTP, in addition to dTTP binding, is reduced considerably suggests a common binding site for these nucleotides. McIntosh and Haynes (16.McIntosh E.M. Haynes R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 6: 1711-1721Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar) also implicated this site in the binding of dTTP to several proteins, including dCMP deaminase and ribonucleotide reductase. Thus, the conservation of an Ala-Ala-Arg site in these regulated proteins suggested that the positively charged guanidinium group of Arg might be involved in the binding of dCTP and dTTP through an electrostatic interaction with their negatively charged phosphate groups. In support of this thesis it is seen in this paper that on replacing Arg115 of the T4-phage dCMP deaminase with a Glu, a mutant is obtained that no longer depends on dCTP for activity and that it is much less sensitive to inhibition by dTTP. In this instance as much as 40% of the activity of the R115E mutant was retained (based on specific activity) relative to the WT-deaminase, with little or no response on addition of dCTP to the assay (Fig. 1). The lack of responsiveness of R115E to dCTP contrasts with R115Q, which although as active as R115E, can still be activated by 30 to 40% by the presence of 20 μm dCTP (Fig. 1). It is perhaps deceptive to compare the activities of the various deaminases on the basis of specific activities alone because of the difference in their molecular weights. Thus, when size is factored in as a result of employing k cat values, that of the WT T4-deaminase is 467 s−1, while in the case of R115E a value of 69 s−1 is obtained. This 7-fold difference contrasts with their specific activities where only a 2-fold difference (Table I) is encountered. In the case of R115E it is clear that this protein is a dimer, but for R115Q its oligomeric state is less certain as it can be a dimer or hexamer or something in between (Fig. 2, TableII). As a dimer the k cat of R115Q is 86 s−1 (Table I), but as a hexamer itsk cat would be 255 s−1. It is therefore important to know what the structural status of a protein is in calculating k cat. At the protein concentration of 0.05–1.0 μg employed in the assay of each of the mutant enzymes, all would appear to be dimers (Table II) whether dCTP is present or not. It is not entirely clear that the size of the holoenzyme is affected by the charge of the amino acid residue at 115 but is suggested by the fact that R115Q has less of a tendency to dissociate at protein concentrations comparable with R115E (Fig. 3, Table II), and the presence of dCTP appears to stabilize the hexameric state of this protein. However, when diluted sufficiently R115Q will dissociate to a dimer whether dCTP is present or not (Table II). By contrast the WT-deaminase retains its hexameric state at the highest levels of dilution (1 μg/ml), particularly in the presence of dCTP. There appears to be a complex relationship between Phe112and Arg115 in their interaction with dCTP and dTTP, as evidenced by the fact that the mutation of either amino acid affects the binding of these nucleotides. As shown earlier (10.Moore J.T. Ciesla J.M. Changchien L.-M. Maley G.F. Maley F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2104-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) conversion of Phe112 to an Ala greatly reduces the binding of dCTP and dTTP and impairs the photofixation of the latter. The importance of Phe in this process is emphasized by the fact the human dCMP deaminase, which contains a Thr-Ala-Ala-Arg sequence (17.Weiner K.X.B. Weiner R.S. Maley F. Maley G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12983-12989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a sequence comparable with that of the phage deaminase, does not photofix dTTP (10.Moore J.T. Ciesla J.M. Changchien L.-M. Maley G.F. Maley F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2104-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Replacement of Phe112 in the phage enzyme with a Thr, as occurs in the case of the human deaminase, might explain why the human enzyme (14.Maley G.F. Lobo A.P. Maley F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1162: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) is not regulated as tightly by dCTP and dTTP. Both residues would thus appear to be important in nucleotide binding, Phe possibly through van der Waals interactions with the pyrimidine ring and Arg via electrostatic interaction with the phosphate of the nucleotides. Whether this proposal is realistic or not might be established through x-ray crystallographic analysis, if reasonable crystals of the WT-deaminase or R115E can be obtained. Meanwhile it would be of interest to determine whether converting the Thr in the human deaminase to a Phe enables this enzyme to now photofix dTTP, or on converting the Arg corresponding to Arg115 to a Glu promotes dimer formation in the human enzyme, as it does with phage deaminase. Another difference between the human and phage deaminases is in the number of Zn2+ atoms associated with each subunit. While it was anticipated that Zn2+ would be associated with the active sites of the human and phage deaminases, based on their similarity to other aminohydrolases such as adenosine (18.Wilson D.K. Rudolph F.B. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) and cytidine deaminase (19.Betts L. Xiang S. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Carter Jr., C.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 635-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), the presence of a second Zn2+ in each subunit of the phage deaminase was unexpected (9.Moore J.T. Silversmith R.E. Maley G.F. Maley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2288-2291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As indicated previously this Zn2+ may be involved in promoting protein-protein interactions between T4-phage dCMP deaminase and T4-phage thymidylate synthase (20.McGaughey K.M. Wheeler L.J. Moore J.T. Maley G.F. Maley F. Matthews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23037-23042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The role of this second Zn2+ site, as well as its location, is still to be clarified and may provide an explanation for why R115E and R115Q retain at least 50% of their activity on denaturation-renaturation in the presence of EDTA, while the WT-deaminase is at least five times more sensitive to this treatment (Fig. 3 B). It is possible that the zinc ions at the active and secondary sites of the WT-deaminase are more exposed to EDTA during denaturation than R115E and R115Q, although preliminary data obtained from sizing analysis has shown that the hexameric state of the WT-deaminase is not restored following denaturation-renaturation in the presence of EDTA, while it is in the absence of EDTA. We express our appreciation to Leslie Eisele of the Biochemistry Core of the Wadsworth Center for her assistance with the molecular weight determinations and to Tammi Stock for typing this manuscript."
