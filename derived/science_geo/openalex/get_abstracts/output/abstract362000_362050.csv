https://openalex.org/W2138761758,"Biodiversity assessment remains one of the most difficult challenges encountered by ecologists and conservation biologists. This task is becoming even more urgent with the current increase of habitat loss. Many methods-from rapid biodiversity assessments (RBA) to all-taxa biodiversity inventories (ATBI)-have been developed for decades to estimate local species richness. However, these methods are costly and invasive. Several animals-birds, mammals, amphibians, fishes and arthropods-produce sounds when moving, communicating or sensing their environment. Here we propose a new concept and method to describe biodiversity. We suggest to forego species or morphospecies identification used by ATBI and RBA respectively but rather to tackle the problem at another evolutionary unit, the community level. We also propose that a part of diversity can be estimated and compared through a rapid acoustic analysis of the sound produced by animal communities. We produced alpha and beta diversity indexes that we first tested with 540 simulated acoustic communities. The alpha index, which measures acoustic entropy, shows a logarithmic correlation with the number of species within the acoustic community. The beta index, which estimates both temporal and spectral dissimilarities, is linearly linked to the number of unshared species between acoustic communities. We then applied both indexes to two closely spaced Tanzanian dry lowland coastal forests. Indexes reveal for this small sample a lower acoustic diversity for the most disturbed forest and acoustic dissimilarities between the two forests suggest that degradation could have significantly decreased and modified community composition. Our results demonstrate for the first time that an indicator of biological diversity can be reliably obtained in a non-invasive way and with a limited sampling effort. This new approach may facilitate the appraisal of animal diversity at large spatial and temporal scales."
https://openalex.org/W2016399929,"Background Honey bees are an essential component of modern agriculture. A recently recognized ailment, Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), devastates colonies, leaving hives with a complete lack of bees, dead or alive. Up to now, estimates of honey bee population decline have not included losses occurring during the wintering period, thus underestimating actual colony mortality. Our survey quantifies the extent of colony losses in the United States over the winter of 2007–2008. Methodology/Principal Findings Surveys were conducted to quantify and identify management factors (e.g. operation size, hive migration) that contribute to high colony losses in general and CCD symptoms in particular. Over 19% of the country's estimated 2.44 million colonies were surveyed. A total loss of 35.8% of colonies was recorded; an increase of 11.4% compared to last year. Operations that pollinated almonds lost, on average, the same number of colonies as those that did not. The 37.9% of operations that reported having at least some of their colonies die with a complete lack of bees had a total loss of 40.8% of colonies compared to the 17.1% loss reported by beekeepers without this symptom. Large operations were more likely to have this symptom suggesting that a contagious condition may be a causal factor. Sixty percent of all colonies that were reported dead in this survey died without dead bees, and thus possibly suffered from CCD. In PA, losses varied with region, indicating that ambient temperature over winter may be an important factor. Conclusions/Significance Of utmost importance to understanding the recent losses and CCD is keeping track of losses over time and on a large geographic scale. Given that our surveys are representative of the losses across all beekeeping operations, between 0.75 and 1.00 million honey bee colonies are estimated to have died in the United States over the winter of 2007–2008. This article is an extensive survey of U.S. beekeepers across the continent, serving as a reference for comparison with future losses as well as providing guidance to future hypothesis-driven research on the causes of colony mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2002708668,"The Argonaute/PIWI protein family consists of Argonaute and PIWI subfamilies. Argonautes function in RNA interference and micro-RNA pathways; whereas PIWIs bind to PIWI-interacting RNAs and regulate germ line development, stem cell maintenance, epigenetic regulation, and transposition. However, the role of PIWIs in mammalian stem cells has not been demonstrated, and molecular mechanisms mediated by PIWIs remain elusive. Here we show that MILI, a murine PIWI protein, is expressed in the cytoplasm of testicular germ line stem cells, spermatogonia, and early spermatocytes, where it is enriched in chromatoid bodies. MILI is essential for the self-renewing division and differentiation of germ line stem cells but does not affect initial establishment of the germ line stem cell population at 7 days postpartum. Furthermore, MILI forms a stable RNA-independent complex with eIF3a and associates with the eIF4E- and eIF4G-containing m7G cap-binding complex. In isolated 7 days postpartum seminiferous tubules containing mostly germ line stem cells, the mili mutation has no effect on the cellular mRNA level yet significantly reduces the rate of protein synthesis. These observations indicate that MILI may positively regulate translation and that such regulation is required for germ line stem cell self-renewal.

These observations indicate that MILI may positively regulate translation and that such regulation is required for germ line stem cell self-renewal. Stem cells are defined by their dual ability to self-renew and to produce numerous differentiated daughter cells. Among adult tissue stem cells, germ line stem cells in mammalian testes serve as the source of spermatogenesis, a robust stem cell-driven process that generates millions of sperm hourly (1Lin H. Sell S. Stem cell Handbook. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ2004: 57-74Google Scholar). In the testis, germ line stem cells can be identified as a subpopulation of spermatogonia that reside in the basal layer of the seminiferous epithelium. These stem cells divide in a self-renewing fashion to produce differentiating spermatogonia, which then further divide and differentiate into numerous spermatocytes. Spermatocytes undergo meiosis to produce haploid round spermatids, which then undertake drastic morphological changes via a process called spermiogenesis to become motile sperm. Germ line stem cells are not only of paramount importance in reproduction but also are effective models for studying molecular mechanisms that define the fate and behavior of stem cells in general. Germ line stem cell division and differentiation are regulated by both intercellular signaling and cell-autonomous mechanisms (1Lin H. Sell S. Stem cell Handbook. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ2004: 57-74Google Scholar). The requirement of intercellular signaling is exemplified by mutations in c-Kit receptors or its ligand, stem cell factor, which causes spermatogonial arrest prior to the differentiating (A1) spermatogonia stage (2de Rooij D.G. Okabe M. Nishimune Y. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 61: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 3Ohta H. Tohda A. Nishimune Y. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 69: 1815-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Intercellular signaling also involves dose-sensitive regulation by Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, since mice heterozygous for its gene (Gdnf) display aberrant germ line stem cell division (4Meng X. Lindahl M. Hyvonen M.E. Parvinen M. de Rooij D.G. Hess M.W. Raatikainen-Ahokas A. Sainio K. Rauvala H. Lakso M. Pichel J.G. Westphal H. Saarma M. Sariola H. Science. 2000; 287: 1489-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). Perhaps the best illustrated cell-autonomous requirements for germ line stem cell maintenance are Plzf and Sox3 genes, both of which encodes transcriptional factors (5Buaas F.W. Kirsh A.L. Sharma M. McLean D.J. Morris J.L. Griswold M.D. de Rooij Braun R.E. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 647-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 6Costoya J.A. Hobbs R.M. Barna M. Cattoretti G. Manova K.

Biol. 2005; 283: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The cell-autonomous mechanism for mammalian germ line stem cell self-renewal probably involves translational regulation, as inferred from studies of germ line stem cells in lower model systems and spermatogenesis in mammals. In Drosophila, translational repression mediated by Pumilio and Nanos is crucial for maintaining the undifferentiated states of germ line stem cells and their precursors, primordial germ cells (8Parisi M. Lin H. Genetics. 1999; 153: 235-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Wang Z. Lin H. Science. 2004; 303: 2016-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 10Gilboa L. Lehmann R. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 981-986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In Caenorhabditis elegans, ATX-2, a homolog of mammalian ATAXIN 2, binds to cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein and is required for translational regulation of germ line stem cell proliferation (11Ciosk R. DePalma M. Priess J.R. Development. 2004; 131: 4831-4841Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In mice, translational regulation has been shown to be crucial for spermiogenesis (12Giorgini F. Davies H.G. Braun R.E. Development. 2002; 129: 3669-3679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although its role in germ line stem cells is not yet determined. However, studies of a mutation that affects germ line stem cell maintenance, Jsd (juvenile spermatogonial depletion), hint at a role for translation in mammalian germ line stem cell self-renewal. Jsd mutant mice can only undergo one round of spermatogenesis, followed by early (Aal) spermatogonia arrest (13Beamer W.G. Cunliffe-Beamer T.L. Shultz K.L. Langley S.H. Roderick T.H. Biol. Reprod. 1988; 38: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Molecular analysis indicates that the Jsd mutation affects mUtp14b, a testis-specific retroposed copy of the ubiquitously expressed gene mUtp14a (14Rohozinski J. Bishop C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11695-11700Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This gene is homologous to the yeast UTP14 gene, which is an essential component of a large ribonucleoprotein complex containing the U3 small nucleolar RNA (15Dragon F. Gallagher J.E. Compagnone-Post P.A. Mitchell B.M. Porwancher K.A. Wehner K.A. Wormsley S. Settlage R.E. Shabanowitz J. Osheim Y. Beyer A.L. Hunt D.F. Baserga S.J. Nature. 2002; 417: 967-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Deletion of UTP proteins in yeast inhibits 18 S rRNA production, indicating that they are part of the active pre-rRNA-processing complex. Similarly, mice lacking Dazl (deleted in azoospermia-like) contain no differentiated spermatogonia (16Ruggiu M. Speed R. Taggart M. McKay S.J. Kilanowski F. Saunders P. Dorin J. Cooke H.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), and Dazl has been implicated in translational regulation of meiotic genes but not germ line stem cells (17Collier B. Gorgoni B. Loveridge C. Cooke H.J. Gray N.K. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2656-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 18Reynolds N. Collier B. Maratou K. Bingham V. Speed R.M. Taggart M. Semple C.A. Gray N.K. Cooke H.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 3899-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Translational regulation of germ line stem cells may involve the PIWI/ARGONAUTE (AGO) protein family, in addition to their known role in transposition repression and epigenetic silencing (19Lin H. Science. 2007; 316: 397Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 20Beyret E. Lin H. Appasani MicroRNAs: From Basic Science to Disease Biology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2007: 497-511Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The PIWI/AGO family was first discovered to be required for stem cell maintenance in diverse organisms, such as Drosophila melanogaster, C. elegans, and Arabidopsis (21Cox D.N. Chao A. Baker J. Chang L. Qiao D. Lin H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3715-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). This stem cell function has also been demonstrated in planaria (22Reddien P.W. Oviedo N.J. Jennings J.R. Jenkin J.C. Sanchez Alvarado A. Science. 2005; 310: 1327-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Recently, the role of piwi genes in C. elegans spermatogenesis has been further defined (23Batista P.J. Ruby J.G. Claycomb J.M. Chiang R. Fahlgren N. Kasschau K.D. Chaves D.A. Gu W. Vasale J.J.

Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 861-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The PIWI/AGO protein family consists of AGO and PIWI subfamilies. AGO proteins bind to ∼21-nucleotide small interfering RNAs and micro-RNAs (miRNAs). 6The abbreviations used are: miRNA, micro-RNA; piRNA, PIWI-interacting RNA; dpp, day(s) postpartum; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. They function in RNA interference and miRNA pathways as essential components of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and RNA-induced silencing of transcription (RITS) complex to negatively regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional and transcriptional level, respectively. Recently, mammalian AGO2 has been shown to up-regulate translation via the AU-rich elements (ARE) in mRNA 3′-untranslated regions (25Vasudevan S. Steitz J. Cell. 2007; 128: 1105-1118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). In contrast, PIWI proteins bind to 24-31-nucleotide PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and regulate germ line development, stem cell maintenance, epigenetic regulation, and transposition (26Grivna S.T. Beyret E. Wang Z. Lin H. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1709-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 27Aravin A. Gaidatzis D. Pfeffer S. Lagos-Quintana M. Landgraf P. Iovino N. Morris P.

Two PIWI proteins in Drosophila, AUBERGINE and PIWI itself, have been genetically implicated in translational regulation (35Wilson J.E. Connell J.E. Macdonald P.M. Development. 1996; 122: 1631-1639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Harris A.N. Macdonald P.M. Development. 2001; 128: 2823-2832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Megosh H.B. Cox D.N. Campbell C. Lin H. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1884-1894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In addition, MIWI, a mouse homolog of PIWI, binds to piRNAs as well as to the mRNA cap and polysomes, with the polysome association correlating to the translational activity during spermatogenesis (26Grivna S.T. Beyret E. Wang Z. Lin H. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1709-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 38Grivna S.T. Pyhtila B. Lin H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13415-13420Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). MILI is a murine PIWI protein that we previously reported to be essential for the early prophase of meiosis (39Kuramochi-Miyagawa S. Kimura T. Ijiri T.W. Isobe T. Asada N. Fujita Y. Ikawa M. Iwai N. Okabe M. Deng W. Lin H. Matsuda Y. Nakano T. Development. 2004; 131: 839-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Most recently, MILI has also been shown to bind to piRNAs (27Aravin A. Gaidatzis D. Pfeffer S. Lagos-Quintana M. Landgraf P. Iovino N. Morris P. Brownstein M.J. Kuramochi-Miyagawa S. Nakano T. Chien M. Russo J.J. Ju J. Sheridan R. Sander C. Zavolan M. Tuschl T. Nature. 2006; 442: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar) and been implicated in transposon control and DNA methylation (28Aravin A. Sachidanandam R. Girard A. Fejes-Toth K. Hannon G.J. Science. 2007; 316: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 40Kuramochi-Miyagawa S. Watanabe T. Gotoh K. Totoki Y. Toyoda A. Ikawa M. Asada N. Kojima K. Yamaguchi Y. Ijiri T.W. Hata K. Li E. Matsuda Y. Kimura T. Okabe M. Sakaki Y. Sasaki H. Nakano T. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 908-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Here, we show that MILI is a cytoplasmic protein specifically expressed in the germ line during early spermatogenesis. Deleting the mili gene severely affects the self-renewing division and differentiation of germ line stem cells, in addition to its meiotic defects. Furthermore, we provide evidence that MILI positively regulates translation in prepubertal testes that contain only stem cells in the germ line, in contrast to the negative role of AGO proteins and their associated small interfering RNAs and miRNAs. These results suggest a function of MILI in promoting germ line stem cell division and differentiation via translational regulation. Antibody Generation-The MILI antibody for immunoprecipitation was generated by Anaspec Inc. (San Jose, CA). Amino acid residues 108-122 of MILI were synthesized, purified, and conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin for immunization in rabbits. The resulting antisera were affinity-purified using MILI peptide conjugated to activated immunoaffinity support (Affi-Gel 15; Bio-Rad). The purified antibody was bound to protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) for immunoprecipitation. A different antibody, DU-PG15, generated in a guinea pig against a 483-amino acid peptide (52.8 kDa) from bp 1634 to 2117 of the Mili open reading frame, was used for immunostaining and Western blotting. Immunoprecipitation and Protein Identification-Testicular lysates were prepared as follows. Mice were asphyxiated with CO2, and testes were dissected. The testes were then decapsulated and homogenized in 1 ml of lysis buffer (100 mm KOAc, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgOAc, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 units/ml RNaseOut (Invitrogen), 1× complete mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) in a Dounce homogenizer for 20 strokes. The lysate was adjusted with lysis buffer to 10 mg/ml. Antibody-bound protein A-Sepharose (washed with lysis buffer minus RNAseOUT and protease inhibitor) was added to the adjusted lysate. The mixture was tumbled end over end for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed, and protein samples were eluted by boiling in 2× SDS sample buffer for 5 min. For the blocking experiment, MILI peptide was added to the beads at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C prior to the addition of lysates. RNase A (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml prior to a 2-h, 4 °C incubation. The RNase A-treated sample and other samples were tumbled end over end for an additional 10 min at room temperature to ensure RNase activity. Co-immunoprecipitated MILI-interacting proteins were identified by mass spectrometry at the Proteomics Center at Duke University Medical Center. RNA in Situ Hybridization and Immunofluorescence Microscopy-RNA in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described by Deng and Lin (41Deng W. Lin H. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 819-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified polyclonal guinea pig MILI antibody (GP15 against amino acid residues 483-644) was used at 1:15 dilution. Plzf mouse monoclonal antibody from Calbiochem was used at a 1:40 dilution. Human anti-GE-1 serum IC6 from Ref. 42Bloch D.B. Gulick T. Bloch K.D. Yang W.H. RNA. 2006; 12: 707-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar was used at a 1:200 dilution to recognize GE-1 in cells. The m7GTP Cap Binding Assay-Testicular extract was prepared as described above and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with either 60 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) or m7GTP Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) in lysis buffer. The beads were then washed, and protein samples were eluted by boiling in 2× SDS sample buffer for 5 min. For the competition experiment, m7GTP was added to the testicular extract to a final concentration of 200 μg/ml and rotated end over end at 4 °C for 1 h prior to incubation with m7GTP-Sepharose. RNA Isolation and Labeling-RNAs were isolated from the bound fraction of immunoprecipitation using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For small RNA labeling, one-half of the RNA co-immunoprecipitated with MILI from 6 mg of testicular extract was dephosphorylated using calf intestinal phosphatase (New England Biolabs) at 10 units/30-μl reaction in 1× calf intestinal phosphatase reaction buffer at 37 °C for 2 h. The dephosphorylated RNA was then precipitated overnight at -20 °C by ethanol and NaAc, supplemented by Glyco Blue glycogen (Invitrogen). End-labeling of small RNAs was performed using polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs), at 10 units/30-μl reaction, using 2 μl of γ-ATP (6000 Ci/mmol). The reaction was performed in 1× T4PNK buffer at 37 °C for 2 h and terminated by adding 1 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. The sample was then put through a Sephadex G-50 RNA purification column (Roche Applied Science) to remove the unincorporated radioactive nucleotides. Formamide sample buffer was added to one-half of the labeled RNA sample, which was resolved on 15% urea polyacrylamide gel. The signal from labeled small RNAs was visualized via autoradiography. For mRNA labeling, one-half of the extracted RNA from immunoprecipitation was used for first-strand cDNA synthesis using Superscript reverse transcriptase H- (Invitrogen) according to the instructions. Oligo(dT)20 was used as primer, and [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was used as the labeling source. Samples were resolved on 1% agarose gel, transferred to nylon membrane, and visualized by autoradiography. Polysome Fractionation-Testicular extract and sucrose gradient fractionation were carried out according to Cataldo et al. (43Cataldo L. Mastrangelo M.A. Kleene K.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. One pair of mouse testes were dissected, decapsulated, and then homogenized in 2 ml of lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 units/ml RNase Out (Invitrogen)), using 20 strokes in the Dounce homogenizer. The lysates were treated with cycloheximide, a translational elongation inhibitor (44Godchaux III, W. Adamson S.D. Herbert E. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 27: 57-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), at a final concentration of 200 μm to stabilize polysomes. The lysate was then centrifuged at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 2 min. The supernatant was then layered on to the top of a 15-50% (w/w) linear sucrose gradient in the lysis buffer. The gradient was centrifuged in Beckman SW40 rotor for 3 h at 150,000 × g in an SW41 rotor (Beckman). The centrifugation was stopped without applying a break. The fractions were then precipitated using 7.2% trichloroacetic acid (final concentration) and dissolved in SDS sample buffer to 2× final concentration. For micrococcal nuclease experiment, micrococcal nuclease (60 units/ml final concentration; Sigma) was added to the lysate, which is supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2 and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by adding EGTA to a final concentration of 25 mm prior to layering on the sucrose gradient, which was supplemented with EGTA as well. [35S]Methionine Pulse-Chase Labeling of Protein Synthesis in Seminiferous Tubules-The [35S]methionine metabolic labeling to measure total protein synthesis in wild type or mutant testes was based on the method of Kleene (43Cataldo L. Mastrangelo M.A. Kleene K.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 45Kleene K.C. Dev. Biol. 1993; 159: 720-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, seminiferous tubules from 7-day postpartum (dpp) mili+/- or mili-/- testes were dissected in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1 mm pyruvic acid and 6 mm lactic acid and then transferred to RPMI medium minus methionine. [35S]methionine (20 μCi/ml) was then added, and the tubules were incubated at 32 °C for 30 min. Total proteins were then extracted and precipitated by 20% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitated proteins were then examined on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel to evaluate the quality of labeling and to examine whether the synthesis of specific proteins is significantly changed in the mutant. The total protein synthesis activity was quantified by scintillation counting of the radioactivity of 20% trichloroacetic acid pellet. Microarray Analysis of the Levels of Total and MILI-associated mRNAs in Wild Type and Mili-/- Mutant-Total RNA from groups of 9-dpp mili+/- or mili-/- testes was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) without any nucleic acid carrier. The high molecular weight RNAs were then further enriched against the low molecular weight RNAs (<200 nucleotides) by selective precipitation in 12.5% polyethylene glycol 8000 and 1.25 m NaCl. The samples were treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega) to remove any contaminating DNA and cleaned with RNeasy columns (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The quantity and quality of the RNA samples were evaluated by both spectrophotometry and gel electrophoresis. For the microarray analysis, 10 μg of each sample was reverse transcribed with oligo(dT) primers and SuperscriptII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). cDNA samples were labeled with Cy3-conjugated nucleotides during the reverse transcription and directly hybridized to a mouse AROS version 3.0 oligonucleotide array (Operon) representing gene transcripts in the mouse. Cy5-labeled oligonulceotides complementary to the probes on the array were externally included in the sample during hybridization as a reference set for initial normalization of the raw data. Likewise, MILI-associated mRNAs were isolated using the TRIzol reagent from the anti-MILI immunoprecipitates from adult (2-4 months old) wild type testicular extract. After one round of amplification with the MessageAmp II RNA amplification kit (Ambion Inc.), the cDNAs were prepared, labeled, and subjected to the microarray chips as above. For the negative control, anti-MILI was blocked with the peptide antigen before applying for immunoprecipitation. The negative control immunoprecipitates were processed and analyzed side by side with the experimental sample in the same way. The same amount and batch of antibodies and extract were used for the negative control as for the experimental sample. The enriched mRNAs in the experimental sample relative to the negative control were dubbed MILI-associated mRNAs, and their expression levels were evaluated in the mili+/- and mili-/- microarray samples. The represented results were derived from five independent replicas for total RNAs from mili+/- and mili-/- and four replicas for MILI-associated mRNAs (reverse transcription, amplification, and hybridization were conducted by the Duke Institute of Genome Sciences and Policy). Bioinformatic Analysis of Microarray Data-Data on relative abundances of mRNAs within total testicular lysates, MILI immunoprecipitation samples, and mock immunoprecipitation samples were generated as follows. Microarray signals from replicates of total lysates were mean-normalized and averaged, respectively, to generate standard gene expression profiles of mouse testicular tissue. The ratio of the signal of each gene from each MILI immunoprecipitation sample to the standard gene expression profile was then calculated. Based on this ratio, a percentile rank of each gene relative to all genes in each immunoprecipitated replicate was calculated. The percentile ranks in the three replicates of MILI-immunoprecipitated samples were averaged. Student's t test was utilized to determine if the average percentile ranks of enrichment of individual genes were significantly higher (p value) than the mean enrichment of all genes in the immunoprecipitation samples. To determine the MILI-associated genes, the following criteria were used: 1) average percentile ranks of enrichment were greater than the mean enrichment of all genes in MILI immunoprecipitation with p < 0.01; 2) average signal in MILI immunoprecipitation replicates was significantly greater than the background signal (including 2× S.D.), with background signal and S.D. calculated based on signals from empty spots on each microarray; 3) criterion 1 was not satisfied for the same gene in the corresponding control immunoprecipitation. Using the above criteria, 802 mRNAs were designated as MILI-associated mRNAs. We further compared the expression profiles of MILI-associated mRNAs as well as nonassociated mRNAs in wild type versus mili-/- testis. All cDNA microarray signals were median-normalized. The relative abundances of individual mRNAs from replicates were averaged. MILI Is Required for Germ Line Stem Cell Self-renewal-We previously reported that mili is required for meiosis (39Kuramochi-Miyagawa S. Kimura T. Ijiri T.W. Isobe T. Asada N. Fujita Y. Ikawa M. Iwai N. Okabe M. Deng W. Lin H. Matsuda Y. Nakano T. Development. 2004; 131: 839-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), which echoes post-germ line stem cell function of piwi and pumilio in the Drosophila ovary (8Parisi M. Lin H.

Although the mili mutant displays a terminal arrest phenotype at the pachytene stage of meiosis, we notice that only 2 ± 2.5% of the mutant spermatogonia actually reach this stage of differentiation (analysis detailed below), indicating an earlier spermatogenic defect prior to meiosis. To characterize the early spermatogenic defect, we examined the mutant testes at critical stages of early spermatogenesis. In mouse testes, the precursors of germ line stem cells, called gonocytes, start proliferation at 3 dpp to establish the population of germ line stem cells (also known as primitive Type A spermatogonia) at 6 dpp. These stem cells then undergo self-renewing divisions to produce differentiated Type A spermatogonia (47Bellve A.R. Millette C.F. Bhatnagar Y.M. O'Brien D.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1977; 25: 480-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). To determine whether this defect occurs prior to stem cell formation at 6 dpp, we examined the number and proliferation rate of gonocytes at 5 dpp by immunofluorescence microscopy, using the gonocyte/spermatogonium-specific EE2 antibody (48Koshimizu U. Nishioka H. Watanabe D. Dohmae K. Nishimune Y. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 40: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) to label gonocytes and anti-phosphohistone 3 antibody to label mitotic cells. The mili-/- and mili+/- tubules were similar in size (51.0 ± 4.0 versus 48.1 ± 5.1 μm in diameter) and contained an equivalent number of gonocytes that proliferated at a similar rate (Fig. 1, A and M). This indicates that the mili mutation does not affect gonocyte proliferation. At 8 dpp, the number of spermatogonia in mili-/- and mili+/- tubules remained similar (Fig. 1, C and D), indicating that the germ line stem cell population had been established normally. However, at 8 dpp, the mili-/- germ line stem cells already showed a reduced mitotic rate (2.1 ± 0.40% versus 3.6 ± 0.4%; p < 0.006; Fig. 1M), indicating that spermatogonia division was compromised in the mili mutant. We then investigated the effects of the mili mutation on spermatogonial division and differentiation at representative stages of p"
https://openalex.org/W2081747986,"Understanding the contribution of the dermis in skin aging is a key question, since this tissue is particularly important for skin integrity, and because its properties can affect the epidermis. Characteristics of matched pairs of dermal papillary and reticular fibroblasts (Fp and Fr) were investigated throughout aging, comparing morphology, secretion of cytokines, MMPs/TIMPs, growth potential, and interaction with epidermal keratinocytes. We observed that Fp populations were characterized by a higher proportion of small cells with low granularity and a higher growth potential than Fr populations. However, these differences became less marked with increasing age of donors. Aging was also associated with changes in the secretion activity of both Fp and Fr. Using a reconstructed skin model, we evidenced that Fp and Fr cells do not possess equivalent capacities to sustain keratinopoiesis. Comparing Fp and Fr from young donors, we noticed that dermal equivalents containing Fp were more potent to promote epidermal morphogenesis than those containing Fr. These data emphasize the complexity of dermal fibroblast biology and document the specific functional properties of Fp and Fr. Our results suggest a new model of skin aging in which marked alterations of Fp may affect the histological characteristics of skin."
https://openalex.org/W2027112793,"Background Growing evidence suggests that sirtuins, a family of seven distinct NAD-dependent enzymes, are involved in the regulation of neuronal survival. Indeed, SIRT1 has been reported to protect against neuronal death, while SIRT2 promotes neurodegeneration. The effect of SIRTs 3–7 on the regulation of neuronal survival, if any, has yet to be reported. Methodology and Principal Findings We examined the effect of expressing each of the seven SIRT proteins in healthy cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) or in neurons induced to die by low potassium (LK) treatment. We report that SIRT1 protects neurons from LK-induced apoptosis, while SIRT2, SIRT3 and SIRT6 induce apoptosis in otherwise healthy neurons. SIRT5 is generally localized to both the nucleus and cytoplasm of CGNs and exerts a protective effect. In a subset of neurons, however, SIRT5 localizes to the mitochondria and in this case it promotes neuronal death. Interestingly, the protective effect of SIRT1 in neurons is not reduced by treatments with nicotinamide or sirtinol, two pharmacological inhibitors of SIRT1. Neuroprotection was also observed with two separate mutant forms of SIRT1, H363Y and H355A, both of which lack deacetylase activity. Furthermore, LK-induced neuronal death was not prevented by resveratrol, a pharmacological activator of SIRT1, at concentrations at which it activates SIRT1. We extended our analysis to HT-22 neuroblastoma cells which can be induced to die by homocysteic acid treatment. While the effects of most of the SIRT proteins were similar to that observed in CGNs, SIRT6 was modestly protective against homocysteic acid toxicity in HT-22 cells. SIRT5 was generally localized in the mitochondria of HT-22 cells and was apoptotic. Conclusions/Significance Overall, our study makes three contributions - (a) it represents the first analysis of SIRT3–7 in the regulation of neuronal survival, (b) it shows that neuroprotection by SIRT1 can be mediated by a novel, non-catalytic mechanism, and (c) that subcellular localization may be an important determinant in the effect of SIRT5 on neuronal viability."
https://openalex.org/W2093340739,"Human-predator conflicts are directly or indirectly threatening many species with extinction. Thus, biologists are urged to find simple solutions to complex situations while avoiding unforeseen conservation outcomes. The provision of supplementary food at artificial feeding sites (AFS) is frequently used in the conservation of scavenger bird populations currently suffering from indirect poisoning, although no scientific studies on its effectiveness have been conducted.We used a long-term data set of 95 individually marked birds from the largest European core of the endangered bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus) to test the long-term effects of specific AFS for bearded vultures on their survival rates (by CMR models) and population dynamics (by Monte Carlo simulations) in an area where fatalities derived from illegal poisoning and the use of other toxics like veterinary drugs have increased over the last several years. Our data support the positive relationship between the use of AFS and survival. However, contrary to theoretical predictions (e.g. high and more stable adult survival among long-lived species), the use of AFS increased only survival of pre-adults. Moreover, AFS buffered the effects of illegal poisoning on this age-class, while adult survival decreased over years. Our simulations predicted a maximum value of extinction probability over a time horizon of 50 years. Population projections run with survival rates expected in scenarios without poisoning predicted the situation of least conservation concern, while including only AFS can maintain a large floater surplus that may delay population decline but fails to reduce poisoning risk among adults.Although AFS are not effective to save bearded vultures from an expected population decline, they delay population extinction and can be a useful tool for prolonging population viability while combating illegal and indirect poisoning. The eradication of different sources of poisoning is of top priority to ensure the long-term viability of this and many other species."
https://openalex.org/W2030308865,"Cholera, caused by Vibrio cholerae, erupted globally from South Asia in 7 pandemics, but there were also local outbreaks between the 6(th) (1899-1923) and 7(th) (1961-present) pandemics. All the above are serotype O1, whereas environmental or invertebrate isolates are antigenically diverse. The pre 7th pandemic isolates mentioned above, and other minor pathogenic clones, are related to the 7(th) pandemic clone, while the 6(th) pandemic clone is in the same lineage but more distantly related, and non-pathogenic isolates show no clonal structure. To understand the origins and relationships of the pandemic clones, we sequenced the genomes of a 1937 prepandemic strain and a 6(th) pandemic isolate, and compared them with the published 7(th) pandemic genome. We distinguished mutational and recombinational events, and allocated these and other events, to specific branches in the evolutionary tree. There were more mutational than recombinational events, but more genes, and 44 times more base pairs, changed by recombination. We used the mutational single-nucleotide polymorphisms and known isolation dates of the prepandemic and 7(th) pandemic isolates to estimate the mutation rate, and found it to be 100 fold higher than usually assumed. We then used this to estimate the divergence date of the 6(th) and 7(th) pandemic clones to be about 1880. While there is a large margin of error, this is far more realistic than the 10,000-50,000 years ago estimated using the usual assumptions. We conclude that the 2 pandemic clones gained pandemic potential independently, and overall there were 29 insertions or deletions of one or more genes. There were also substantial changes in the major integron, attributed to gain of individual cassettes including copying from within, or loss of blocks of cassettes. The approaches used open up new avenues for analysing the origin and history of other important pathogens."

The most pronounced N40D effects were found in brain regions involved in the sensory processing of pain intensity. Using the μ-opioid receptor-specific agonist DAMGO, we analyzed the μ-opioid receptor signaling, expression, and binding affinity in human brain tissue sampled postmortem from the secondary somatosensory area (SII) and from the ventral posterior part of the lateral thalamus, two regions involved in the sensory processing and transmission of nociceptive information. We show that the main effect of the N40D μ-opioid receptor variant is a reduction of the agonist-induced receptor signaling efficacy. In the SII region of homo- and heterozygous carriers of the variant 118G allele (n = 18), DAMGO was only 62% as efficient (p = 0.002) as in homozygous carriers of the wild-type 118A allele (n = 15). In contrast, the number of [3H]DAMGO binding sites was unaffected. Hence, the μ-opioid receptor G-protein coupling efficacy in SII of carriers of the 118G variant was only 58% as efficient as in homozygous carriers of the 118A allele (p < 0.001). The thalamus was unaffected by the OPRM1 118A>G SNP. In conclusion, we provide a molecular basis for the reduced clinical effects of opioid analgesics in carriers of μ-opioid receptor variant N40D.

However, in vitro experiments trying to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms provided inconsistent results, falling short to support the comparatively strong clinical evidence of decreased opioid effects in carriers of the variant 118G allele. Among the reported molecular consequences of the 118A>G polymorphism is a three times higher binding affinity of β-endorphin at the N40D μ-opioid receptors expressed in transfected Syrian hamster adenovirus-12-induced tumor cells (AV-12), whereas the affinity of other exogenous opioids was unaffected (10Bond C. LaForge K.S. Tian M. Melia D. Zhang S. Borg L. Gong J. Schluger J. Strong J.A. Leal S.M. Tischfield J.A. Kreek M.J. Yu L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9608-9613Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). In contrast, a leftward shift of the potencies of DAMGO and morphine-mediated Ca2+ channel inhibition has been shown in N40D variant μ-opioid receptor expressed in rat sympathetic superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons (11Margas W. Zubkoff I. Schuler H.G. Janicki P.K. Ruiz-Velasco V. J Neurophysiol. 2007; 97: 1058-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, both findings of a higher ligand affinity and potency were not reproduced in three attempts using N40D variant μ-opioid receptors transfected Cercopithecus aethiops kidney cells (COS), human 293 embryonic kidney cells (HEK293), and again AV-12 cells (12Befort K.

As an alternative mechanism, decreased μ-opioid receptor expression caused by the OPRM1 118G variant has been demonstrated in transfected HEK293 cells (13Beyer A. Koch T. Schroder H. Schulz S. Hollt V. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) (15Zhang Y. Wang D. Johnson A.D. Papp A.C. Sadee W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32618-32624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). However, decreased μ-opioid receptor expression as the molecular mechanism for the 118A>G variant was contradicted by the report of unchanged receptor expression in N40D variant receptors expressing HEK293 cells (12Befort K.

Adding to the inconsistency of molecular findings in transfected cell lines, a recent report demonstrated either decreased or unchanged receptor expression in HEK293 and AV-12 cells, respectively, depending on the transfection method (14Kroslak T. Laforge K.S. Gianotti R.J. Ho A. Nielsen D.A. Kreek M.J. J. Neurochem. 2007; 103: 77-87PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, a single investigation assessing OPRM1 118A>G effects in postmortem human brain tissue indicated reduced OPRM1 mRNA levels in carriers of the variant 118G allele (15Zhang Y. Wang D. Johnson A.D. Papp A.C. Sadee W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32618-32624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). However, the effects of the variant 118G allele on μ-opioid receptor protein expression and function were not examined in that investigation. Moreover, whether the analyzed pooled brain tissue from regions such as cortical lobes and pons are to be considered as primary parts of the pain matrix (16Apkarian A.V. Bushnell M.C. Treede R.D. Zubieta J.K. Eur. J. Pain. 2005; 9: 463-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (2272) Google Scholar) is unknown. Thus, attempts to identify the molecular mechanism of the clinical functionality of the OPRM1 118A>G genetic variant have produced inconsistent or incomplete results that do not satisfyingly explain the clinically observed decreased analgesic effects of opioids in carriers of this variant. This is probably partly attributable to the artificial conditions in non-human non-neuronal cells and partly to the neglect of region-dependent effects on μ-opioidergic mechanisms in the human brain, which is strongly suggested to play a role for 118A>G by recent fMRI results (17Oertel B.G. Preibisch C. Wallenhorst T. Hummel T. Geisslinger G. Lanfermann H. Lotsch J. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 2008; 83: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Specifically, the presence of the OPRM1 118A>G SNP decreased the analgesic effects of alfentanil primarily at brain regions processing the sensory dimension of pain whereas brain regions processing the affective dimension appeared to be unaffected. Considering this fMRI evidence for its brain region-specific effects, we analyzed by means of the μ-opioid receptor-specific agonist DAMGO the consequences of the OPRM1 118A>G SNP for μ-opioid receptor signaling, expression and ligand binding affinity in human brain tissue from brain regions known to take part in the processing of the sensory dimension of pain. This included the ventral posterior part of the lateral thalamus where the spinothalamic pathway transmitting peripheral noxious information from the dorsal horn of the spinal cord to the thalamus terminates (18Price D.D. Science. 2000; 288: 1769-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it included the secondary somatosensory cortex (SII) as one of its cortical projection areas processing the sensory dimension of pain (19Coghill R.C. Sang C.N. Maisog J.M. Iadarola M.J. J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 1934-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 20Bornhovd K. Quante M. Glauche V. Bromm B. Weiller C. Buchel C. Brain. 2002; 125: 1326-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) where opioid effects on pain-related brain activation have been shown to be affected by the OPRM1 118A>G SNP (17Oertel B.G. Preibisch C. Wallenhorst T. Hummel T. Geisslinger G. Lanfermann H. Lotsch J. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 2008; 83: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Tissue Collection and OPRM1 Genetic Testing-Human brain tissue was sampled during autopsy from the secondary somatosensory cortex SII and the ventral posterior part of the lateral thalamus from 95 subjects without known actual opioid treatment or actual or previous drug addiction (ethics approval obtained). DNA was extracted from the brain tissue using the BioRobot® EZ1 work station and the EZ1 DNA Tissue kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Subsequently, by means of a validated Pyrosequencing™ assay (21Skarke C. Kirchhof A. Geisslinger G. Lotsch J. Clin. Chem. 2004; 50: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), these samples were diagnosed to contain 68 non-carriers, 24 heterozygous, and three homozygous carriers of the variant OPRM1 118G allele, of which brain tissue was analyzed from all three homozygous carriers, from 18 heterozygous carriers, and from a random sample of 16 non-carriers of the variant drawn to match the number of carriers (for more subject-related details see supplemental Table S1). Because of limited tissue availability, it was not possible to employ every subject in all experiments. Therefore, the exact sample sizes are indicated at the respective results. Experiments were performed in an investigator-blinded fashion with respect to the sample genotype. Membrane Preparation-Tissue (1-1.5 g) was homogenized with a fast rotating Ultra-Turrax (Janke & Kunkel GmbH, Staufen i. Breisgau, Germany) in 10-15 volumes of homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 290 mm d(+)-saccharose). The crude tissue lysate was immediately centrifuged at 1,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, and the supernatant again at 45,000 × g, at 4 °C for 45 min. The pellet was resuspended in ice-cold isolation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and stored at -80 °C pending further analysis. Protein concentrations were measured according to the method of Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). Assessment of DAMGO-induced μ-Opioid Receptor Signaling Efficacy and Potency-The efficacy (BNet) and potency (EC50) of d-Ala2,N-MePhe4,Gly-ol5-enkephalin (DAMGO, Sigma-Aldrich) to trigger μ-opioid receptor signaling were assessed by fitting a sigmoidal concentration-response curve to [35S]GTPγS binding data (for experimental details and equations see supplemental material). The experiments were performed as published previously (23Gonzalez-Maeso J. Rodriguez-Puertas R. Gabilondo A.M. Meana J.J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 390: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). [35S]GTPγS binding data were acquired by incubation of membrane proteins with 0.5 nm [35S]GTPγS (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) in the presence of 50 μm GDP (Sigma-Aldrich) and increasing concentrations of DAMGO (0 nm-100 μm). In addition, control experiments were performed under equal conditions with the non-opioid agonist adenosine (0 nm to 100 μm; Sigma-Aldrich) to verify that observed differences between genotype groups were not related to potential confounders, e.g. tissue variability. Assessment of [3H]DAMGO Binding Sites and Affinity-The number of [3H]DAMGO binding sites (BMax) and its affinity (KD) were assessed by fitting a one site hyperbola to the data of the specific saturation binding of [3H]DAMGO (Amersham Biosciences). Specific [3H]DAMGO binding data were acquired by incubation of membrane proteins with at least 10 different concentrations of [3H]DAMGO in the range of 0.07-14.42 nm in the presence and absence of 10 μm naloxone (Naloxon-Curamed, Curamed, Karlsruhe, Germany). Control experiments were performed by incubation of membrane proteins with at least 6 different concentrations of [3H]adenosine (Amersham Biosciences) in the range of 17-500 nm in the presence and absence of 1 mm adenosine (Sigma-Aldrich). Furthermore, OPRM1 mRNA expression was analyzed by means of quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR) analysis of OPRM1 mRNA expression in relation to human ACTB (β-actin) mRNA (for experimental details and equations, see supplemental materials). Statistics-The numerical values of the BNet, EC50, BMax, and KD were obtained by non-linear regression analyzes of individual data using GraphPad Prism® 5.01 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). OPRM1 mRNA expression was determined by using the comparative Ct method (2-ΔΔCt; for equations see supplemental materials). Because BNet(DAMGO) correlated statistically significantly with BMax([3H]DAMGO) in SII (Pearson correlation: 0.41, p = 0.018) and thalamus (0.61, p < 0.001), the net effect of agonist binding per μ-opioid receptor was calculated separately for each subject and each brain region as the quotient of DAMGO efficacy and the number of DAMGO binding sites, BNet(DAMGO)/BMax([3H]DAMGO). This allowed for comparison of μ-opioid receptor-G-protein coupling efficacy between brain regions and genotype groups (24Sim L.J. Selley D.E. Xiao R. Childers S.R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 307: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 25Maher C.E. Selley D.E. Childers S.R. Biochem.

Because of the small number of homozygous 118G carriers, hetero- and homozygous carriers of the 118G allele were pooled and subsequent group comparisons were made for two groups (i.e. non-carriers of the 118G allele “118AA” and carriers of the “118G” allele “118G”). The region-specific effects of the OPRM1 118A>G single nucleotide polymorphism were analyzed by means of multivariate analysis of variance for repeated measures (rm-ANOVA), with region (i.e. SII or thalamus; degrees of freedom, df = 1) as within-subject factor and 118A>G (i.e. 118AA or 118G; df = 1) as between-subject factor (SPSS 15.0.1.1, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The α-level was set at 0.05. Post-hoc comparisons for statistical main effects were done by t-tests. In the case of significant effects of the ORPM1 118A>G genotype, the influence of potential confounders was checked, e.g. the subject′s sex (t-tests), age at death, postmortem delay, and tissue storage period (correlation analyses). Subject-related Data-The group of homozygous carriers of the wild-type allele (118AA) and the group of hetero- and homozygous carriers of the variant 118G allele (118G) differed not with respect to the subjects' sex (118AA: 6 men and 10 women; 118G: 10 men and 11 women; Chi2-test: p = 0.74), age at death (118AA: 53.2 years (mean), 19-84 years (range); 118G: 57.8 years, 23-92 years; Independent samples t-tests: p = 0.50), postmortem delay (118AA: 31.7 h, 4-85 h; 118G: 31.1 h, 7-85 h; p = 0.94), and tissue storage period (118AA: 18.9 months, 10-28 months; 118G: 17.3 months, 9-28 months; p = 0.39). DAMGO-induced μ-Opioid Receptor Signaling Efficacy and Potency-The efficacy of DAMGO to stimulate [35S]GTPγS binding, BNet(DAMGO), was similar in the SII and thalamus as indicated by the absence of a statistical main effect of rm-ANOVA factor region (F (1,1,31) = 0.003, p = 0.96; Fig. 1 and Table 1). Similarly, the 118G allele had no effect on the efficacy of DAMGO as indicated by the absence of a statistical main effect of rm-ANOVA factor 118A>G (F (1,1,31) = 1.78, p = 0.19). However, the genotype influenced significantly the DAMGO efficacy in a brain region-dependent manner (rm-ANOVA interaction region by 118A>G: F (1,1,31) = 6.78, p = 0.014). Specifically, a genotype effect was seen exclusively in SII, where in hetero- and homozygous 118G carriers DAMGO was only 62% as efficient as in homozygous carriers of the 118A allele (t test: t(31) = 3.45, p = 0.002). This was not the case for the thalamus, where the DAMGO efficacy was not different between non-carriers and carriers of the variant 118G allele (t test: t(31) = 0.39, p = 0.70). The potential confounders sex (t test: t(31) = -1.30, p = 0.20), age at death, postmortem delay, and storage period (Pearson correlation: p > 0.08) had no influence on BNet(DAMGO) in SII.TABLE 1[35S]GTPγS binding data after DAMGO and adenosine stimulation in tissue samples from the secondary somatosensory area, SII, and from the ventral posterior part of the lateral thalamusAgonistValueNOPRM1SIIThalamusUnit118Value95% CIValue95% CIDAMGOBNetaBNet, maximum net binding of [35S]GTPγS after agonist stimulation.

Open table in a new tab Similar to DAMGO-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding, the control experiments with the non-opioid agonist adenosine (Fig. 1 and Table 1) showed that the efficacy of adenosine, BNet(adenosine), was similar in both brain regions (rm-ANOVA factor region: F (1,1,28) = 1.46, p = 0.24) and that it was unaffected by the 118G allele (rm-ANOVA factor 118A>G: F (1,1,28) = 1.36, p = 0.25). However, in contrast to DAMGO-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding, the genotype had no significant influence on the adenosine efficacy in a brain region-dependent manner (interaction region by 118A>G: F (1,1,28) = 0.52, p = 0.48). This further indicates that the observed brain region-dependent differences of [35S]GTPγS binding after DAMGO stimulation between non-carriers and carriers of the 118G allele were indeed related to the 118G allele, and not the result of potential confounders, e.g. tissue variability. The potency of DAMGO to stimulate [35S]GTPγS binding, EC50(DAMGO), was brain region-dependent with a significantly lower potency of DAMGO in SII than in the thalamus as indicated by the higher EC50(DAMGO) in SII (rm-ANOVA factor region: F (1,1,31) = 13.77, p = 0.001). However, the potency did not differ significantly between homozygous carriers of the 118A allele and hetero- and homozygous carriers of the 118G allele (p ≥ 0.28; Table 1). In contrast, the control agonist adenosine was equally potent in SII and thalamus of carriers of either genotype as indicated by the absence of any statistically significant main effect of the rm-ANOVA (p ≥ 0.23; Table 1). [3H]DAMGO Binding Sites and Affinity-The number of DAMGO binding sites, BMax([3H]DAMGO), was significantly lower in SII than in the thalamus (rm-ANOVA factor region: F (1,1,31) = 16.28, p < 0.001; Fig. 1 and Table 2). The lower number of DAMGO binding sites was affirmed by lower OPRM1 mRNA expression in SII compared with the thalamus (rm-ANOVA factor region: F (1,1,20) = 7.03, p = 0.015). The OPRM1 118A>G SNP had no statistically significant effect on the number of DAMGO binding sites (p ≥ 0.46) and OPRM1 mRNA-expression levels (p ≥ 0.60), respectively.TABLE 2[3H]DAMGO binding data, [3H]adenosine binding data, and OPRM1 mRNA expression data in tissue samples from the secondary somatosensory area, SII, and from the ventral posterior part of the lateral thalamusAgonistValueNOPRM1SIIThalamusUnit118Value95% CIValue95% CI[3H]DAMGOBMaxaBMax, maximum number of agonist binding sites.15AA97[71,123]151[115,186]fmol/mg protein18bConsisting of 15 heterozygous carriers (118AG) and 3 homozygous carriers (118GG) of the 118G allele.G114[91,138]151[118,183]KDcKD, equilibrium dissociation constant.15AA1.9[1.3,2.5]1.4[0.8,2.0]nm18bConsisting of 15 heterozygous carriers (118AG) and 3 homozygous carriers (118GG) of the 118G allele.G2.5[1.9,3.1]1.8[1.2,2.3][3H]AdenosineBMax12AA10.0[6.6,13.5]13.0[7.7,18.4]pmol/mg protein17dConsisting of 14 heterozygous carriers (118AG) and 3 homozygous carriers (118GG) of the 118G allele.G12.4[9.5,15.3]15.7[11.2,20.2]KD12AA696[194,1198]505[0,1134]nm17dConsisting of 14 heterozygous carriers (118AG) and 3 homozygous carriers (118GG) of the 118G allele.G353[55,652]348[52,643]OPRM1 mRNA2−ΔΔCte2−ΔΔCt, OPRM1 mRNA expression in relation to human ACTB (β-actin) mRNA.11AA1.5[0.7,2.4]3.0[1.1,4.8]-11fConsisting of 8 heterozygous carriers (118AG) and 3 homozygous carriers (118GG) of the 118G allele.G1.4[0.6,2.2]3.6[1.7,5.4]a BMax, maximum number of agonist binding sites.b Consisting of 15 heterozygous carriers (118AG) and 3 homozygous carriers (118GG) of the 118G allele.c KD, equilibrium dissociation constant.d Consisting of 14 heterozygous carriers (118AG) and 3 homozygous carriers (118GG) of the 118G allele.e 2−ΔΔCt, OPRM1 mRNA expression in relation to human ACTB (β-actin) mRNA.f Consisting of 8 heterozygous carriers (118AG) and 3 homozygous carriers (118GG) of the 118G allele.

Again, the OPRM1 118A>G SNP had no statistically significant effect on the affinity of [3H]DAMGO (p ≥ 0.16; Fig. 1 and Table 2). BMax and KD of [3H]adenosine were similar in both brain regions and unaffected by the OPRM1 118A>G SNP as indicated by the absence of a statistically significant main effect of the rm-ANOVA (p ≥ 0.08; Table 2). μ-Opioid Receptor G-protein Coupling Efficacy-Analysis of the ratio BNet(DAMGO)/BMax([3H]DAMGO) confirmed a brain region-dependent μ-opioid receptor G-protein coupling efficacy (rm-ANOVA factor region: F (1,1,31) = 30.81, p < 0.001; Fig. 1 and Table 3), which was modulated by the 118A>G genotype (rm-ANOVA factor 118A>G: F (1,1,31) = 8.42, p = 0.007 and rm-ANOVA interaction region by 118A>G: F (1,1,31) = 19.05, p < 0.001). Post-hoc comparisons showed that BNet(DAMGO)/BMax([3H]DAMGO) in SII of 118G carriers was only 58% as efficient as in 118AA carriers (t test: t(31) = 4.31, p < 0.001) while it was similar in the thalamus of 118AA and 118G carriers (t test: t(31) = 0.23, p = 0.82).

We show that the main functional effect of the OPRM1 118A>G variant is a decrease in the μ-opioid receptor signaling efficacy in a brain region, SII, known to be an important part of the pain matrix that codes for the pain intensity.

Anesthesiology. 2008; 109: 520-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The results are also in strong agreement with the fMRI observation that the genetic variant mainly affects the effects of opioid analgesics on the sensory component of pain (17Oertel B.G. Preibisch C. Wallenhorst T. Hummel T. Geisslinger G. Lanfermann H. Lotsch J. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 2008; 83: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), which is emphasized by the fact that the main molecular effect was presently found in the SII region. Based on the absent effect of the OPRM1 genotype in the control experiments with the non-opioid agonist adenosine and on the lack of influences of potential confounders, a contribution of factors such as tissue degradation to the differences of μ-opioid receptor signaling/-coupling between non-carriers and carriers of OPRM1 variant 118G appears to be unlikely. The present selection of brain regions was limited to SII and the thalamus, two brain regions known to be involved in the sensory processing of pain intensity. However, other brain regions as the two here selected may also be affected. This is suggested by the fMRI findings of 118G effects (17Oertel B.G. Preibisch C. Wallenhorst T. Hummel T. Geisslinger G. Lanfermann H. Lotsch J. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 2008; 83: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) being present also in other brain regions involved in the processing of pain, e.g. the posterior insula and SI. Although the μ-opioid receptor expression differed significantly between the two presently chosen brain regions, we could not reproduce a genotype difference in receptor expression levels as previously shown in human brain samples from pons and cortical lobes (15Zhang Y. Wang D. Johnson A.D. Papp A.C. Sadee W. J. Biol.

While it is possible that we missed an OPRM1 118G effect on μ-opioid receptor protein expression because [3H]DAMGO binds only to agonist states of the μ-opioid receptor (27Neilan C.L. Janvey A.J.

Ther. 2003; 306: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), the analysis of OPRM1 mRNA expression affirms the conclusion that μ-opioid receptor expression is unaffected by the OPRM1 118A>G SNP in both investigated brain regions. However, the fact that we missed an OPRM1 118G effect on μ-opioid receptor expression may also relate to brain region specific effects of the 118G allele. Regionally limited alterations of μ-opioid receptor expression have already been shown for other SNPs known to affect the opioid system, e.g. the COMT 472G>A polymorphism (28Zubieta J.K. Heitzeg M.M.

Nevertheless, the presented results make a global reduction of receptor expression unlikely as a general molecular mechanism for the reduced analgesia in carriers of OPRM1 variant 118G.

In conclusion, we provide a molecular basis for the reduced clinical effects of opioid analgesics in carriers of the μ-opioid receptor variant N40D. The variant has region-specific effects on the μ-opioid receptor signaling evident in parts of the pain matrix, consisting of a decreased receptor signaling efficiency after stimulation by exogenous opioid receptor agonists in a brain region known to process the sensory component of pain, i.e. pain intensity.

https://openalex.org/W2006944441,"Aggregation of mutated proteins is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington disease. We previously reported that overexpression of the HspB8.Bag3 chaperone complex suppresses mutated huntingtin aggregation via autophagy. Classically, HspB proteins are thought to act as ATP-independent molecular chaperones that can bind unfolded proteins and facilitate their processing via the help of ATP-dependent chaperones such as the Hsp70 machine, in which Bag3 may act as a molecular link between HspB, Hsp70, and the ubiquitin ligases. However, here we show that HspB8 and Bag3 act in a non-canonical manner unrelated to the classical chaperone model. Rather, HspB8 and Bag3 induce the phosphorylation of the alpha-subunit of the translation initiator factor eIF2, which in turn causes a translational shut-down and stimulates autophagy. This function of HspB8.Bag3 does not require Hsp70 and also targets fully folded substrates. HspB8.Bag3 activity was independent of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress kinase PERK, demonstrating that its action is unrelated to ER stress and suggesting that it activates stress-mediated translational arrest and autophagy through a novel pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2025147658,"Connexin26 (Cx26) and connexin30 (Cx30) are two major protein subunits that co-assemble to form gap junctions (GJs) in the cochlea. Mutations in either one of them are the major cause of non-syndromic prelingual deafness in humans. Because the mechanisms of cochlear pathogenesis caused by Cx mutations are unclear, we investigated effects of Cx30 null mutation on GJ-mediated ionic and metabolic coupling in the cochlea of mice. A novel flattened cochlear preparation was used to directly assess intercellular coupling in the sensory epithelium of the cochlea. Double-electrode patch clamp recordings revealed that the absence of Cx30 did not significantly change GJ conductance among the cochlear supporting cells. The preserved electrical coupling is consistent with immunolabeling data showing extensive Cx26 GJs in the cochlea of the mutant mice. In contrast, dye diffusion assays showed that the rate and extent of intercellular transfer of multiple fluorescent dyes (including a non-metabolizable D-glucose analogue, 2-NBDG) among cochlear supporting cells were severely reduced in Cx30 null mice. Since the sensory epithelium in the cochlea is an avascular organ, GJ-facilitated intercellular transfer of nutrient and signaling molecules may play essential roles in cellular homeostasis. To test this possibility, NBDG was used as a tracer to study the contribution of GJs in transporting glucose into the cochlear sensory epithelium when delivered systemically. NBDG uptake in cochlear supporting cells was significantly reduced in Cx30 null mice. The decrease was also observed with GJ blockers or glucose competition, supporting the specificity of our tests. These data indicate that GJs facilitate efficient uptake of glucose in the supporting cells. This study provides the first direct experimental evidence showing that the transfer of metabolically-important molecules in cochlear supporting cells is dependent on the normal function of GJs, thereby suggesting a novel pathogenesis process in the cochlea for Cx-mutation-linked deafness."
https://openalex.org/W2167797128,"Background Schistosoma japonicum is a major public health concern in China, with over one million people infected and another 40 million living in areas at risk of infection. Unlike the disease caused by S. mansoni and S. haematobium, schistosomiasis japonica is a zoonosis, involving a number of different mammalian species as reservoir hosts. As a result of a number of published reports from China, it has long been considered that bovines, particularly water buffaloes, play a major role in human S. japonicum transmission there, and a drug-based intervention study (1998–2003) around the Poyang Lake in Jiangxi Province provided proof of concept that water buffaloes are, indeed, major reservoirs of human infection in this setting. Methods and Findings In this study we incorporated recently obtained epidemiological information to model the steady-state S. japonicum transmission as well as the impact of the removal of S. japonicum transmission attributable to water buffaloes on human infection rates across six different endemic scenarios within three villages in the Dongting (Hunan) and Poyang (Jiangxi) lakes of southern China. Similar results were obtained for all scenarios. Steady-state S. japonicum infection rates remained constant and human prevalence and incidence were predicted to fall considerably over time. The model showed that the contribution of S. japonicum water buffalo transmission to human infection ranged from 39.1% to 99.1% and predicted that the removal of water buffalo transmission would reduce parasite reproductive rates below 1. This indicates that without the contribution of water buffaloes, S. japonicum transmission is interrupted and unsustainable. These scenarios are generalizable to other endemic villages in the lake and marshland areas of China where a similar cycle of snail infection and infection/reinfection of humans and bovines occurs. Conclusions Along with previous epidemiological data, our findings strongly support water buffaloes as an important component of the transmission cycle that affects humans in the lake and marshlands region of China, a feature which appears to differ from the situation prevalent in the Philippines where their contribution is less pronounced. Our conclusions underscore the rationale for removal, replacement or treatment of water buffaloes, and for the development and deployment of a transmission blocking buffalo vaccine against S. japonicum for this setting to achieve the goal of transmission control. The Chinese Government has recently commenced a new integrated national strategy to improve on existing approaches to control schistosomiasis in the lake and marshlands region by reducing bovines and humans as a source of S. japonicum infection to Oncomelania snails."

We hypothesized that a dietary intervention would demonstrate the importance of using glucose versus non-glucose carbon sources to synthesize triglycerides in white adipose tissue. C57BL/6J mice were fed either a low fat, high carbohydrate (HC) diet or a high fat, carbohydrate-free (CF) diet and maintained on 2H2O (to determine total triglyceride dynamics) or infused with [6,6-2H]glucose (to quantify the contribution of glucose to triglyceride glycerol). The 2H2O labeling data demonstrate that although de novo lipogenesis contributed ∼80% versus ∼5% to the pool of triglyceride palmitate in HC- versus CF-fed mice, the epididymal adipose tissue synthesized ∼1.5-fold more triglyceride in CF- versus HC-fed mice, i.e. 37 ± 5 versus 25 ± 3 μmol × day–1. The [6,6-2H]glucose labeling data demonstrate that ∼69 and ∼28% of triglyceride glycerol is synthesized from glucose in HC- versus CF-fed mice, respectively. Although these data are consistent with the notion that non-glucose carbon sources (e.g. glyceroneogenesis) can make substantial contributions to the synthesis of triglyceride glycerol (i.e. the absolute synthesis of triglyceride glycerol from non-glucose substrates increased from ∼8 to ∼26 μmol × day–1 in HC- versus CF-fed mice), these observations suggest (i) the importance of nutritional status in affecting flux rates and (ii) the operation of a glycerol-glucose cycle.

For example, α-glycerol-3-phosphate can be derived from glucose, glycerol, and pyruvate. Although it is clear that the liver can utilize all of these pathways depending on the nutritional/hormonal status, there is an uncertainty regarding the contribution of the various pathways to the formation of α-glycerol-3-phosphate in white adipose tissue in vivo. Although many investigators agree that glucose plays an important role in triglyceride synthesis in adipose tissue and that glycerol makes a minor (if any) contribution to α-glycerol-3-phosphate (because there is low glycerol kinase activity), the potential for converting pyruvate to α-glycerol-3-phosphate (referred to as glyceroneogenesis) is intriguing (7Chen J.L.

This logic assumes that the production of α-glycerol-3-phosphate from glucose results in an n of 3.5, whereas the production ofα-glycerol-3-phosphate from lactate, pyruvate, etc. results in an n of 5 (7Chen J.L.

Enzymes were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Diets were purchased from Research Diets (New Brunswick, NJ). Mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Osmotic pumps (Alzet 2001D) were purchased from Durect Corp. (Cupertino, CA). Chronic Labeling Study-On arrival, male C57BL/6J mice (5 weeks old, n = 32) were fed a high carbohydrate (HC), low fat diet (D12450B, kcal distribution equal to 10% fat, 70% carbohydrate, and 20% protein). After 5 days, mice were randomized into two groups and either maintained on the HC diet or fed a high fat, carbohydrate-free (CF) diet (D12369B, 90% fat, 0% carbohydrate, and 10% protein). The diet intervention proceeded for 10 days; all mice were then given an intraperitoneal injection of labeled water (20 μl/g of body weight of 9 g of NaCl in 1,000 ml 99% 2H2O). In all cases, to ensure the precision of the injection, mice were sedated by a brief exposure (∼15 s) to isoflurane (Baxter Pharmaceuticals, Deerfield, IL); mice regained consciousness within a minute with no apparent adverse side effects. After injection, mice were returned to their cages (n = four mice per cage) and maintained on 5% 2H-labeled drinking water for the remainder of the study; this design maintained a steady-state 2H labeling of body water at ∼2.75% (6Brunengraber D.Z.

Mice in each group were fed the respective diets ad libitum, and daily food consumption was measured. Mice were sedated on various days after injection (n = 4 per day per group), and blood and tissue samples were then collected and quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were stored at –80 °C until analyses. Acute Labeling Study-On arrival, male C57BL/6J mice (5 weeks old, n = 30) were fed an HC, low fat diet (D12450B, kcal distribution equal to 10% fat, 70% carbohydrate and 20% protein). After 5 days, mice were randomized into two groups and either maintained on the HC diet or fed a high fat, CF diet (D12369B, 90% fat, 0% carbohydrate, and 10% protein). The diet intervention proceeded for 14 days, and seven mice in each diet group were then randomized to receive an intraperitoneal injection of labeled water (20 μl/g of body weight of 9 g of NaCl in 1,000 ml of 99% 2H2O) under isoflurane anesthesia during which a sham incision was made to the skin. Mice were returned to their cages (n = 4 mice per cage) and maintained on unlabeled drinking water for 24 h, and blood was sampled 2 h after 2H2O injection and at the time of tissue collection. The remaining eight mice in each diet were anesthetized under isoflurane and implanted with Alzet 2001D osmotic pumps loaded with 200 μl of [6,6-2H]glucose (500 mg/ml), which had been primed for 4 h at 37 °C in saline (16Xu J.

After 24 h, blood and epididymal fat samples were collected from all mice. 2H Labeling of Body Water-The 2H labeling of body water was determined by exchange with acetone (17Yang D. Diraison F. Beylot M. Brunengraber D.Z. Samols M.A. Anderson V.E. Brunengraber H. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were centrifuged for 1 min at ∼12,000 × g in a microcentrifuge, and 20 μl of sample (or standard) was reacted with 2 μl of 10 n NaOH and 4 μl of a 5% (v/v) solution of acetone in acetonitrile for 24 h at room temperature. Acetone was then extracted by the addition of 600 μl of chloroform followed by the addition of ∼0.5 g of Na2SO4. Samples were vigorously mixed, and a small aliquot of the chloroform was transferred to a GC-MS vial. Acetone was analyzed using an Agilent 5973N-MSD equipped with an Agilent 6890 GC system, and a DB-17MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) was used in all analyses. The temperature program was as follows: 60 °C initial, increase by 20 °C per min to 100 °C, increase by 50 °C per min to 220 °C, and hold for 1 min. The sample was injected at a split ratio of 40:1 with a helium flow of 1 ml/min. Acetone eluted at ∼1.5 min. The mass spectrometer was operated in the electron impact mode (70 eV). Selective ion monitoring of m/z 58 and 59 was performed using a dwell time of 10 ms/ion. 2H Labeling of Triglyceride-bound Glycerol-Total glycerides were extracted from frozen epididymal fat pads by first hydrolyzing both fat pads in 1 n KOH ethanol at 70 °C (6Brunengraber D.Z. McCabe B.J. Kasumov T. Alexander J.C. Chandramouli V. Previs S.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: E917-E925Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). After 3 h, the hydrolysate was evaporated to dryness, and the dry residue was redissolved in 3 ml of H2O and acidified to ∼pH 1.0 by adding 6 n HCl. Free fatty acids were extracted using diethyl ether (three times with 4 ml). The pH of the aqueous solution was then adjusted to ∼7.0 (using 10 n NaOH). Free glycerol was isolated by passing the sample over a layered ion-exchange bed (AG 50W-X8, hydrogen form and AG 1-X8, formate form) and washing with 20 ml of water, and the eluent containing glycerol was evaporated to dryness. The glycerol labeling was determined following conversion to its triacetate derivative by reacting the dry residue with 100 μl of pyridine:acetic anhydride (1:1, v/v) at 75 °C for 30 min. The 2H labeling of triacetyl glycerol was determined using an Agilent 5973N-MSD equipped with an Agilent 6890 GC system. A DB-17MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) was used in all analyses. The temperature program was 120 °C initial, increased by 10 °C per min to 200 °C, and increased by 50 °C per min to 240 °C, with a 2-min hold time. The split ratio was 40:1 with helium flow of 1 ml/min, and triacetyl glycerol eluted at ∼8.0 min. Ammonia chemical ionization was used, and selective ion monitoring of NH +4 adducts was performed, m/z 236, 237, and 238 (M+0, M+1 and M+2), with a 10-ms dwell time per ion. Concentration of Triglyceride-bound Glycerol-The concentration of triglyceride-bound glycerol was determined by enzymatic spectrophotometric assay. Briefly, epididymal fat pads were hydrolyzed, and free glycerol was obtained as described above. Glycerol was then redissolved in a known amount of Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 7.4), and its concentration was determined using an enzymatic assay (free glycerol reagent, Sigma). 2H Labeling and Concentration Profile(s) of Triglyceride-bound Fatty Acids-A known quantity of tissue was hydrolyzed and extracted after adding a known amount of heptadecanoic acid. Fatty acids were analyzed as their trimethylsilyl derivatives using gas chromatography-electron impact ionization mass spectrometry. The 2H enrichment of palmitate was determined by using selective ion monitoring of m/z 313–317 (M+0to M+4), with a 10-ms dwell time per ion (6Brunengraber D.Z. McCabe B.J. Kasumov T. Alexander J.C. Chandramouli V. Previs S.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: E917-E925Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The concentration of palmitate (16:0), stearate (18:0), oleate (18:1), and linoleate (18:2) was determined by comparing the corrected abundance of m/z 313–317, 341–345, 339, and 337, respectively, with that of heptadecanoate (17:0, m/z 327). To account for possible differences in the ionization efficiency of each fatty acid, the profile was compared against standards prepared by mixing known quantities of each fatty acid (6Brunengraber D.Z. McCabe B.J. Kasumov T. Alexander J.C. Chandramouli V. Previs S.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: E917-E925Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). 2H Labeling and Concentration of Blood Glucose-A known amount of [U-13C6]glucose (internal standard) was added to a known amount of blood and then deproteinized by the addition of methanol (10 μl internal standard + 10 μl blood + 200 μl of methanol). The supernatant was evaporated to dryness and reacted with 100 μl of pyridine:acetic anhydride (1:1) at 70 °C for 30 min. The 2H labeling of glucose pentaacetate was determined using an Agilent 5973N-MSD equipped with an Agilent 6890 GC system. A DB-17MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) was used in all analyses. The temperature program was 150 °C initial, increased by 10 °C per min to 250 °C, increased by 50 °C per min to 300 °C, with a 2-min hold time. The split ratio was 40:1 with helium flow of 1 ml/min with glucose pentaacetate eluted at ∼7.5 min. Ammonia chemical ionization was used, and selective ion monitoring of NH +4 adducts was performed, m/z 408–414 (M+0 to M+6), with a 10-ms dwell time per ion. We determined the rates of triglyceride synthesis (μmol × day–1) as described previously (accounting for changes in both the 2H labeling and pool size) (6Brunengraber D.Z. McCabe B.J. Kasumov T. Alexander J.C. Chandramouli V. Previs S.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: E917-E925Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In this study, we have accounted for the fact that mice were continuously maintained on 2H2O as compared with previous studies where non-steady-state 2H labeling was used. Triglyceride dynamics were determined using the equationa1-BAt+BcA where a is the asymptotic value of the 2H labeling of triglyceride glycerol, B is the pool size of triglyceride on day 0 (μmol), At + B is the rate of increase of adipose tissue triglyceride (assumed to be linear), and c is the rate of triglyceride synthesis (μmol × day–1). Once the rate of synthesis was determined, the rate of degradation was calculated from the net change in triglyceride pool size (which equals synthesis minus degradation). Note that our approach to modeling the reaction rates is conceptually similar to the approach used by Hellerstein and colleagues (8Turner S.M. Murphy E.J. Neese R.A. Antelo F. Thomas T. Agarwal A. Go C. Hellerstein M.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: E790-E803Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), although the actual flux rates are numerically different (∼10% lower using our approach) due to the manner in which the problem has been defined, i.e. we account for the change in pool size over time (assumed to be linear). In mice given 2H2O for 3–28 days (chronic labeling study), the percentage of contribution of de novo lipogenesis to the pool of triglyceride palmitate was calculated using the equation&percnt;newlymadepalmitate=[total&percnt;2Hlabelingpalmitate/(H2labelingbodywater×n)]×100 where n is the number of exchangeable hydrogens, assumed to equal 22 (18Lee W.N.

Mass Spectrom. 1997; 32: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The percentage of contribution of glyceroneogenesis to triglyceride glycerol was calculated as described by Chen et al. (7Chen J.L. Peacock E. Samady W. Turner S.M. Neese R.A. Hellerstein M.K. Murphy E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25396-25402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) using the equation&percnt;glyceroneogenesis=[(n-3.5)/1.5]×100 where n is the number of exchangeable carbon-bound hydrogens, determined using the equationn=[2×(R/2H-labelingwater)]+1 where R is the ratio of excess M2/M1 labeling of triglyceride glycerol (18Lee W.N. Bassilian S. Ajie H.O. Schoeller D.A. Edmond J. Bergner E.A. Byerley L.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: E699-E708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mice given 2H2O for 24 h (acute labeling study), the “% total newly made triglyceride glycerol” was calculated using the equation&percnt;totalnewlymadetriglyceride-glycerol=[H2-labelingoftriglyceride-glycerol/(H2-labelingofwater×n)]×100Eq. 5 where 2H labeling of triglyceride glycerol is the M1 isotopomer, the 2H labeling of water is the average labeling in a given mouse, and n is the exchange factor (experimentally determined from the M2/M1 ratio of triglyceride glycerol in the chronic labeling study). In mice given [6,6-2H]glucose, the “% newly made triglyceride glycerol from glucose” was calculated using the equation&percnt;newlymadetriglyceride-glycerolfromglucose=[(Etriglyceride-glycerol×2)/Eglucose]×100Eq. 6 where Etriglyceride glycerol is the M2 labeling of triglyceride glycerol and Eglucose is the M2 labeling of plasma glucose, and the factor of 2 accounts for the dilution of [6,6-2H]glucose during its conversion to triose phosphates. Thus, the contribution of glucose to the total newly made triglyceride glycerol is determined in the acute study by dividing Equation 6 by Equation 5, and the contribution of non-glucose carbon sources is (1 – [Equation 6/Equation 5]). Because we measured the labeling of [6,6-2H]glucose at two points in time, we expect that our estimates of triglyceride synthesis from glucose represent a minimum flux rate, i.e. consumption of food (which occurred primarily during the dark cycle) will transiently dilute the labeling of blood glucose in HC mice. Last, the rate of glucose appearance (Ra) was calculated using the equationRa=I×[(Einfusate/Eplasma)-1] where I is the infusion rate of [6,6-2H]glucose and Einfusate and Eplasma are the enrichments of the infusate and plasma, respectively (21Wolfe R.R. Chinkes D.L. Isotope Tracers in Metabolic Research: Principles and Practice of Kinetic Analysis. Wiley-Liss, New York2004Google Scholar). The concentration of glucose was determined from the ratio of (M0+M2)/(M6) glucose. Unless noted, the total 2H labeling of a molecular species is reported, i.e. M1 + 2·M2, etc. where M1, M2, etc. refer to the percentage of excess product molecules with 1, 2, etc. 2H atoms, respectively (18Lee W.N. Bassilian S. Ajie H.O. Schoeller D.A. Edmond J. Bergner E.A. Byerley L.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: E699-E708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Data are reported as mean ± S.E. Statistical analyses were done using a two-tailed t test and assuming equal variance. Fig. 1 demonstrates a net increase in triglyceride-bound fatty acids with time and is consistent with our earlier study (6Brunengraber D.Z. McCabe B.J. Kasumov T. Alexander J.C. Chandramouli V. Previs S.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: E917-E925Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) where we observed a disproportionate increase in the amount of unsaturated versus saturated fatty acids. Also, the fatty acid profile of the tissue did not reflect that of the respective diets. Consistent with an increase in total fatty acids, we observed an increase in triglyceride glycerol between 3 and 28 days, i.e. in HC-fed mice epididymal glycerol increased from 326 ± 36 to 393 ± 49 μmol (p < 0.01) and in CF-fed mice from 329 ± 27 to 512 ± 66 μmol (p < 0.01). Fig. 2 demonstrates the 2H labeling of triglyceride-bound palmitate in mice chronically exposed to 2H2O. As expected, we observed a continuous increase in the proportion of heavily labeled palmitate over the course of the study in mice fed the HC diet (panel A). However, in mice fed the CF diet, very little of the palmitate was derived from de novo lipogenesis (panel B), i.e. 5 ± 2% of the palmitate is newly made in mice fed the CF diet versus 80 ± 4% newly made palmitate in mice fed the HC diet. Fig. 3 demonstrates the incorporation of 2H over 28 days into triglyceride glycerol in epididymal fat pads of mice fed the HC versus the CF diet. The fractional synthetic rates were determined by fitting the increase in 2H labeling to a single exponential, i.e. 7.7 ± 0.2% versus 11.8 ± 1.2% newly made triglyceride per day in HC- versus CF-fed mice, respectively. The calculated rates of triglyceride synthesis were 25 ± 3 and 37 ± 5 μmol made per day, and the calculated rates of degradation were 22 ± 3 and 30 ± 5 μmol per day in HC- and CF-fed mice, respectively. We used two approaches to dissect the contribution of glucose versus non-glucose carbon sources to triglyceride glycerol. First, in the “chronic labeling study,” we measured the labeling pattern of triglyceride glycerol and applied the equations proposed by Chen et al. (7Chen J.L. Peacock E. Samady W. Turner S.M. Neese R.A. Hellerstein M.K. Murphy E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25396-25402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); we determined that glucose contributes 48 ± 8% versus 10 ± 7% of the triglyceride glycerol in mice fed the HC (n = 4.28 ± 0.11) versus the CF (n = 4.85 ± 0.12) diet, respectively. Second, in the “acute labeling study,” we compared the M2 labeling of triglyceride glycerol with that of plasma glucose and then compared (i.e. normalized) those data against the respective groups that were given labeled water; we determined that glucose contributes 69 ± 4 and 28 ± 3% of the triglyceride glycerol in mice fed the HC and in mice fed the CF, respectively (Table 1). In regard to the source(s) of triglyceride glycerol, in both diet groups, the “acute labeling data” (double tracer approach) are different from the “chronic labeling data” (mass isotopomer distribution approach) (p < 0.01).TABLE 12H labeling in mice undergoing the “acute double-tracer protocol”High carbohydrate dietCarbohydrate-free diet2 h24 h2 h24 h2H2O groupWater labeling (mpe)2.73 ± 0.082.22 ± 0.052.85 ± 0.052.47 ± 0.09Plasma glucose labeling (M1, mpe)7.57 ± 0.538.98 ± 0.9415.36 ± 0.8213.99 ± 0.74Plasma glucose labeling (% of theoretical maximum)40 ± 358 ± 687 ± 592 ± 4Triglyceride-glycerol labeling (M1, mpe)ND1.01 ± 0.09ND1.82 ± 0.11% of newly made triglyceride-glycerol (total)ND9.6 ± 0.9ND16.9 ± 1.4[6,6-2H]glucose groupPlasma glucose labeling (M2, mpe)8.29 ± 0.979.39 ± 0.8517.41 ± 1.0319.08 ± 1.42Triglyceride-glycerol labeling (M2, mpe)ND0.32 ± 0.04ND0.46 ± 0.04% of newly made triglyceride-glycerol (from glucose)ND6.8 ± 0.4ND5.1 ± 0.6Relative triglyceride-glycerol fluxContribution of glucose (%)ND69 ± 4ND28 ± 3Contributi"
https://openalex.org/W2099139278,"Low-intensity electrical current (or mild electrical stimulation; MES) influences signal transduction and activates phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. Because insulin resistance is characterized by a marked reduction in insulin-stimulated PI3K-mediated activation of Akt, we asked whether MES could increase Akt phosphorylation and ameliorate insulin resistance. In addition, it was also previously reported that heat shock protein 72 (Hsp72) alleviates hyperglycemia. Thus, we applied MES in combination with heat shock (HS) to in vitro and in vivo models of insulin resistance. Here we show that 10-min treatment with MES at 5 V (0.1 ms pulse duration) together with HS at 42°C increased the phosphorylation of insulin signaling molecules such as insulin receptor substrate (IRS) and Akt in HepG2 cells maintained in high-glucose medium. MES (12 V)+mild HS treatment of high fat-fed mice also increased the phosphorylation of insulin receptor β subunit (IRβ) and Akt in mice liver. In high fat-fed mice and db/db mice, MES+HS treatment for 10 min applied twice a week for 12–15 weeks significantly decreased fasting blood glucose and insulin levels and improved insulin sensitivity. The treated mice showed significantly lower weight of visceral and subcutaneous fat, a markedly improved fatty liver and decreased size of adipocytes. Our findings indicated that the combination of MES and HS alleviated insulin resistance and improved fat metabolism in diabetes mouse models, in part, by enhancing the insulin signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2099846504,"The variety of ways in which faces are categorized makes face recognition challenging for both synthetic and biological vision systems. Here we focus on two face processing tasks, detection and individuation, and explore whether differences in task demands lead to differences both in the features most effective for automatic recognition and in the featural codes recruited by neural processing.Our study appeals to a computational framework characterizing the features representing object categories as sets of overlapping image fragments. Within this framework, we assess the extent to which task-relevant information differs across image fragments. Based on objective differences we find among task-specific representations, we test the sensitivity of the human visual system to these different face descriptions independently of one another. Both behavior and functional magnetic resonance imaging reveal effects elicited by objective task-specific levels of information. Behaviorally, recognition performance with image fragments improves with increasing task-specific information carried by different face fragments. Neurally, this sensitivity to the two tasks manifests as differential localization of neural responses across the ventral visual pathway. Fragments diagnostic for detection evoke larger neural responses than non-diagnostic ones in the right posterior fusiform gyrus and bilaterally in the inferior occipital gyrus. In contrast, fragments diagnostic for individuation evoke larger responses than non-diagnostic ones in the anterior inferior temporal gyrus. Finally, for individuation only, pattern analysis reveals sensitivity to task-specific information within the right ""fusiform face area"".OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE: 1) information diagnostic for face detection and individuation is roughly separable; 2) the human visual system is independently sensitive to both types of information; 3) neural responses differ according to the type of task-relevant information considered. More generally, these findings provide evidence for the computational utility and the neural validity of fragment-based visual representation and recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1981120510,"The CXCR4 chemokine receptor regulates migration and homing of cancer cells to specific metastatic sites. Determination of the CXCR4 receptor status will provide predictive information for disease prognosis and possible therapeutic intervention. However, previous attempts to localize CXCR4 using poorly characterized mouse monoclonal or rabbit polyclonal antibodies have produced predominant nuclear and occasional cytoplasmic staining but did not result in the identification of bona fide cell surface receptors.In the present study, we extensively characterized the novel rabbit monoclonal anti-CXCR4 antibody (clone UMB-2) using transfected cells and tissues from CXCR4-deficient mice. Specificity of UMB-2 was demonstrated by cell surface staining of CXCR4-transfected cells; translocation of CXCR4 immunostaining after agonist exposure; detection of a broad band migrating at M(r) 38,000-43,000 in Western blots of homogenates from CXCR4-expressing cells; selective detection of the receptor in tissues from CXCR4+/+ but not from CXCR4-/- mice; and abolition of tissue immunostaining by preadsorption of UMB-2 with its immunizing peptide. In formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human tumor tissues, UMB-2 yielded highly effective plasma membrane staining of a subpopulation of tumor cells, which were often heterogeneously distributed throughout the tumor. A comparative analysis of the mouse monoclonal antibody 12G5 and other frequently used commercially available antibodies revealed that none of these was able to detect CXCR4 under otherwise identical conditions.Thus, the rabbit monoclonal antibody UMB-2 may prove of great value in the assessment of the CXCR4 receptor status in a variety of human tumors during routine histopathological examination."
https://openalex.org/W1998302143,"Background Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF1) and its receptor CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) play a critical role in progenitor cell homing, mobilization and differentiation. It would be interesting to assess the predictive value of SDF-1alpha level for EPC number, and to ascertain whether there is a relationship between SDF1 gene variation, plasma SDF-1alpha level, and the number and function of circulating EPCs. We also tested whether EPC number and function was related to CXCR4 gene variation. Methodology and Principal Findings We genotyped a cohort of individuals who participated in the Bruneck Study for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the SDF1 and CXCR4 genes, and measured blood SDF1α level as well as EPC number and function. SDF1α levels were correlated with age, gender, alcohol consumption, circulating reticulocyte numbers, and concentrations of matrix metalloproteinase-9, C-reactive protein, cystatin C, fibrinogen and homocytein. In blood samples taken in 2005, EPC number was inversely associated with SDF1α level (p<0.001). EPC number in 2005 was also inversely associated with SDF1α level in 2000 (p = 0.009), suggesting a predictive value of plasma SDF1α level for EPC number. There was an association between the SDF1 gene rs2297630 SNP A/A genotype, increased SDF1α level (p = 0.002) and lower EPC number (p = 0.006). Conclusions Our data indicate that a SDF1 gene variation (rs2297630) has an influence on SDF1α level and circulating EPC number, and that plasma SDF1α level is a predictor of EPC number."
https://openalex.org/W1995722821,"Background During an entomological survey in preparation for malaria control interventions in Mwea division, the number of malaria cases at the Kimbimbi sub-district hospital was in a steady decline. The underlying factors for this reduction were unknown and needed to be identified before any malaria intervention tools were deployed in the area. We therefore set out to investigate the potential factors that could have contributed to the decline of malaria cases in the hospital by analyzing the malaria control knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) that the residents in Mwea applied in an integrated fashion, also known as integrated malaria management (IMM). Methods Integrated Malaria Management was assessed among community members of Mwea division, central Kenya using KAP survey. The KAP study evaluated community members' malaria disease management practices at the home and hospitals, personal protection measures used at the household level and malaria transmission prevention methods relating to vector control. Concurrently, we also passively examined the prevalence of malaria parasite infection via outpatient admission records at the major referral hospital in the area. In addition we studied the mosquito vector population dynamics, the malaria sporozoite infection status and entomological inoculation rates (EIR) over an 8 month period in 6 villages to determine the risk of malaria transmission in the entire division. Results A total of 389 households in Mwea division were interviewed in the KAP study while 90 houses were surveyed in the entomological study. Ninety eight percent of the households knew about malaria disease while approximately 70% of households knew its symptoms and methods to manage it. Ninety seven percent of the interviewed households went to a health center for malaria diagnosis and treatment. Similarly a higher proportion (81%) used anti-malarial medicines bought from local pharmacies. Almost 90% of households reported owning and using an insecticide treated bed net and 81% reported buying the nets within the last 5 years. The community also used mosquito reduction measures including, in order of preference, environmental management (35%), mosquito repellent and smoke (31%) insecticide canister sprays (11%), and window and door screens (6%). These methods used by the community comprise an integrated malaria management (IMM) package. Over the last 4 years prior to this study, the malaria cases in the community hospital reduced from about 40% in 2000 to less than 10% by 2004 and by the year 2007 malaria cases decreased to zero. In addition, a one time cross-sectional malaria parasite survey detected no Plasmodium infection in 300 primary school children in the area. Mosquito vector populations were variable in the six villages but were generally lower in villages that did not engage in irrigation activities. The malaria risk as estimated by EIR remained low and varied by village and proximity to irrigation areas. The average EIR in the area was estimated at 0.011 infectious bites per person per day. Conclusions The usage of a combination of malaria control tools in an integrated fashion by residents of Mwea division might have influenced the decreased malaria cases in the district hospital and in the school children. A vigorous campaign emphasizing IMM should be adopted and expanded in Mwea division and in other areas with different eco-epidemiological patterns of malaria transmission. With sustained implementation and support from community members integrated malaria management can reduce malaria significantly in affected communities in Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2011834697,"Bone morphogenic protein (BMP)-7 is a member of the BMP family which are structurally and functionally related, and part of the TGFβ super family of growth factors. BMP-7 has been reported to inhibit renal fibrosis and TGFβ1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), in part through negative interactions with TGFβ1 induced Smad 2/3 activation. We utilized in vivo bleomycin-induced fibrosis models in the skin and lung to determine the potential therapeutic effect of BMP-7. We then determined the effect of BMP-7 on TGFβ1-induced EMT in lung epithelial cells and collagen production by human lung fibroblasts. We show that BMP-7 did not affect bleomycin-induced fibrosis in either the lung or skin in vivo; had no effect on expression of pro-fibrotic genes by human lung fibroblasts, either at rest or following exposure to TGFβ1; and did not modulate TGFβ1 -induced EMT in human lung epithelial cells. Taken together our data indicates that BMP-7 has no anti-fibrotic effect in lung or skin fibrosis either in vivo or in vitro. This suggests that the therapeutic options for BMP-7 may be confined to the renal compartment."
https://openalex.org/W2046368360,"Heparan sulfate (HS)/heparin and dermatan sulfate (DS) both bind with high affinity to hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) and function as necessary co-factors in vitro. How both these two structurally distinct glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are recognized has remained unclear. We have now reconciled this issue using a panel of minimal tri- and tetrasaccharide sequences of variable but well defined sulfation patterns in combination with further development of the gel mobility shift assay to allow simultaneous comparisons of relative protein affinities/selectivities for different oligosaccharides. From this approach it would seem that a minimum binding sequence is a disulfated trisaccharide comprised of an internal iduronate flanked by monosulfated hexosamine residues and that additional sulfation further enhances affinity. However, the similarity in recognition of HS/heparin and DS seems to arise primarily from a lack of any apparent positional requirement for sulfation. Thus, isomers of HS/heparin tetrasaccharides containing only two sulfates irrespective of whether they are purely N-, 2-O-, or 6-O-sulfates bind with equivalent apparent affinity as a disulfated DS tetrasaccharide. In addition, the NMR chemical shifts induced in NK1 (the truncated variant of HGF/SF comprised of the N-terminal and first Kringle domains) by titration with either heparin or DS oligosaccharides strongly indicate that both bind to essentially the same site. Together, these observations reveal an unexpected degree of flexibility in the GAG-HGF/SF interface, allowing a single binding site in the protein to accommodate iduronate-containing sequences of variable sulfation pattern and/or density from different GAGs.

HGF/SF interacts with relatively short GAG oligosaccharides; the minimum even-numbered HS/heparin fragment that displays high affinity binding in vitro is a tetrasaccharide (dp4), and this also corresponds to the smallest, bioactive, repeating disaccharide structure (18Delehedde M.

Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43560-43567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The major HS/heparin-binding site resides in the N-terminal domain of HGF/SF. Indeed, a heparin tetradecasaccharide has been co-crystallized with the truncated NK1 splice variant of HGF/SF, which only comprises the N-terminal domain, N, and the first Kringle domain, K1; the crystal structure identified the major GAG contacts as being in the N-domain, although in some crystals additional contacts were made with K1 (16Lietha D. Chirgadze D.Y. Mulloy B. Blundell T.L. Gherardi E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5543-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Subsequently, all the individually expressed domains of HGF/SF (i.e. the N-domain and the four Kringles, K1–K4, that comprise the α-chain and the serine proteinase homology domain, SP, corresponding to the β-chain) were compared by heparin affinity chromatography and gel mobility shifts assays, and these confirmed the existence of a weaker GAG-binding site in K1 as well as revealing an additional low affinity site in the SP domain (20Holmes O. Pillozzi S. Deakin J.A. Carafoli F. Kemp L. Butler P.J.G. Lyon M. Gherardi E. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 395-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, there are also other reports using domain-deleted (21Hartmann G. Prospero T. Brinkmann V. Ozcelik O. Winter G. Hepple J. Batley S. Bladt F. Sachs M. Birchmeier C. Birchmeier W. Gherardi E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 8: 125-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and point-mutated (22Mizuno K. Inoue H. Hagiya M. Shimizu S. Nose T. Shimohigashi Y. Nakamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1131-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) forms of HGF/SF that suggest that K2 may contribute to GAG binding by native, full-length HGF/SF even though this was not confirmed by the behavior of isolated K2 (20Holmes O. Pillozzi S. Deakin J.A. Carafoli F. Kemp L. Butler P.J.G. Lyon M. Gherardi E. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 395-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). NK1 also binds DS (19Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Lietha D. Gherardi E. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43560-43567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), probably mediated by the N-domain (20Holmes O.

Biol. 2007; 367: 395-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar); neither the isolated K1 domain nor the β-chain from HGF/SF bind independently to DS even though they possess weak heparin affinity (20Holmes O. Pillozzi S. Deakin J.A. Carafoli F. Kemp L. Butler P.J.G. Lyon M. Gherardi E. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 395-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, joint heparin/HS and DS affinity appears to be restricted to the N-domain. This begs the question as to whether both GAG types bind with high affinity to a single, dual-specificity binding site or whether the N-domain contains two distinct sites with differential GAG specificities. A recent investigation of the binding and activating properties of a range of native and specifically desulfated GAGs suggested that GAG binding to NK1 was of relatively low specificity (23Catlow K.R. Deakin J.A. Wei Z. Delehedde M. Fernig D.G. Gherardi E. Gallagher J.T. Pavaño M.S.G. Lyon M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5235-5248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Binding could be sustained by a low level of overall sulfation (as displayed by DS) as long as, critically, the GAG contained iduronate (IdoA), although increased sulfation enhanced affinity (as with heparin) and ultimately could override the need for IdoA. The greater conformational flexibility of IdoA is assumed to provide increased overall chain flexibility that may optimize the spatial disposition of the necessary contact groups within the GAG. A low sulfate density in the presence purely of β-D-glucuronic acid, as in mammalian chondroitin sulfate, was inadequate for binding NK1. The results of selective desulfations suggested that there may not be a strict requirement for any specific sulfation position in either HS/heparin or DS. This is compatible with the possibility of the N-domain containing a single low specificity binding site for both HS/heparin and DS. However, interpretations of such studies using polymeric GAGs are complicated because desulfation methods are rarely quantitative, and minor amounts of specific sulfate groups may be sufficient to support binding especially if the protein recognizes short sequences. The GAG co-factor requirement of HGF/SF-mediated activation of MET provides an opportunity for potential clinical inhibition of HGF/SF activity via disruption of the necessary component co-factor interaction (for review, see Ref. 24Lyon M. Delehedde M. Lortat-Jacob H. New Developments in Therapeutic Glycomics. Research Signpost, Trivandrum, India2007: 317-350Google Scholar). The ability of exogenous GAG species as small as dp4s to engage in productive complex formation opens up possibilities for small-molecule inhibition either based upon potentially inhibitory, modified GAG oligosaccharides or novel synthetic mimetics. Our recent demonstration of the inhibition of HGF/SF-mediated ERK-MAPK signaling and cell migration in vitro by synthetic, sulfated, non-sugar GAG mimics (25Raiber E.-A. Wilkinson J.A. Manetti F. Botta M. Deakin J. Gallagher J.T. Lyon M. Ducki S.W. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2007; 17: 6321-6325Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) demonstrated proof of principle and opens the way for improved inhibition by better-designed agents. It is difficult to elucidate the GAG binding specificity of HGF/SF using intact, structurally heterogeneous GAGs. Thus, the aims of the present study were to utilize minimal GAG oligosaccharides of defined structure (see supplemental Tables 1 and II) to (i) provide an improved description of the structural requirements for GAG-HGF/SF interaction and also (ii) to resolve the question of whether HS/heparin and DS occupy identical or distinct binding sites within the N-domain of HGF/SF. Such information may aid the future rational design of small-molecule inhibitors of HGF/SF that target its GAG co-factor requirement. Materials-Recombinant human HGF/SF was obtained from R&D Systems (Abingdon, UK). Bovine lung heparin, porcine intestinal mucosal heparin, chondroitinases ABC (Proteus vulgaris; EC 4.2.2.4), and chondroitinase AC-I (Pedobacter heparinus; EC 4.2.2.5) were obtained from Sigma. Low molecular weight heparin (Innohep®) was from Leo Pharma (Princes Risborough, UK). Porcine intestinal mucosal DS was from Celsus Laboratories Inc. (Cincinatti, OH). Completely de-sulfated/re-N-sulfated heparin was obtained from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). Heparinases I (P. heparinus; EC 4.2.2.7), II (P. heparinus; no EC number assigned), and III (P. heparinus; EC 4.2.2.8) were purchased from Grampian Enzymes (Harray, Orkney, UK). Bio-Gel P10 was from Bio-Rad Laboratories. Pre-packed PD-10 desalting columns were purchased from GE Healthcare. The CHO pgsA-745 mutant cell line was a generous gift from Prof. Jeffrey Esko (University of California at San Diego, CA). Preparation of NK1-Human NK1 was purified from the culture medium of a Pichia pastoris recombinant expression system provided by Dr. Ermanno Gherardi (MRC Centre, Cambridge, UK) as previously described (26Chirgadze D.Y. Hepple J.P. Zhou H. Byrd A. Blundell T.L. Gherardi E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). 15N-Labeled NK1 for NMR titrations was produced by growth of the P. pastoris clone in 0.8-liter cultures in a Bioflow 3000 fermentor (New Brunswick Scientific, St. Albans, UK) using [15N]ammonium sulfate (>98%; Sigma) as the sole nitrogen source. Preparation of Hexasulfated Heparin Tetrasaccharide- Heparin dp4s were prepared by the fractionation of low molecular weight heparin by gel filtration. To increase the yield of dp4s, the heparin was partially digested with heparinase I (0.1 unit added to a 60-ml solution of 5 mg/ml heparin in 0.1 m sodium acetate, 0.1 mm calcium acetate, pH 7.0, at 37 °C for 6 h). Small aliquots were removed at regular intervals and rapidly chromatographed on a Superdex Peptide HR 10/30 HPLC column (10 × 300 mm; GE Healthcare Life) eluted with 0.2 m NH4HCO3 at 0.5 ml/min and monitored by UV absorbance at 232 nm to assess the degree of depolymerization. At an appropriate level of breakdown, the digest was terminated by boiling, concentrated by lyophilization, and then subjected to gel filtration chromatography on a Bio-Gel P-10 column (2.5 × 115 cm) eluted with 0.2 m NH4HCO3 at a flow rate of 10 ml/h. Fractions of 2 ml were collected and monitored for UV absorbance at 232 nm. The peak corresponding to total dp4s was pooled and freeze-dried twice to remove NH4HCO3. This was then subfractionated by application in pH 3.5 water (adjusted with HCl) to a semipreparative ProPac PA1 strong anion-exchange (SAX) HPLC column (4.6 × 250 mm; Dionex, Camberley, UK) eluted with a gradient of 0–1.5 m NaCl, pH 3.5, over 90 min at a flow rate of 4 ml/min with in-line monitoring of UV absorbance at 232 nm. The latest eluting dp4 peak, corresponding to the hexasulfated species, was collected and desalted on a PD10 column run in water. Quantitation was by absorbance at 232 nm. Composition was confirmed by disaccharide analysis. Preparation of DS Tetrasaccharides-Porcine intestinal mucosal DS (1 g) in 50 ml of 75 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, was fully digested with 1 IU of chondroitinase AC-1 followed by partial digestion with 1 IU of chondroitinase ABC. Small aliquots were removed at regular intervals and checked for the degree of breakdown as described earlier. The final digest was fractionated on a Bio-Gel P-10 column (as described for heparin oligosaccharides above), and the dp4 peak was pooled and freeze-dried twice to remove NH4HCO3. The mixed DS dp4 pool was applied in water to a Sphereclone 5-μm SAX-HPLC column (4.6 × 250 mm; Phenomenex, Macclesfield, UK) and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1.0 m NaCl over 60 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. UV absorbance at 232 nm was monitored on-line. Individual dp4 peaks were separately pooled, desalted on PD-10 columns eluted with distilled water, and then freeze-dried. Quantitation was by absorbance at 232 nm. Compositions and, thus, likely structures were confirmed by disaccharide analyses. Preparation of Heparin and DS Trisaccharides-Trisaccharides (dp3s) were prepared by chemical removal of the non-reducing unsaturated uronate residue from heparin, and DS dp4s by the method of Ludwigs et al. (27Ludwigs U. Elgavish A. Esko J.D. Meezan E. Rodén L. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). dp4S (1 mg) were dissolved in 75 μl of 10 mm mercuric acetate, pH 5.0, and incubated at 20 °C for 40 min. The sample was adjusted to 1 ml with 5 m NaCl and applied to a Superdex Peptide HR 10/30 HPLC column equilibrated in 0.2 m NH4HCO3. The column was run at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with on-line UV monitoring at 206 nm. Fractions of 0.25 ml were collected, and the peak corresponding to the dp3 was collected and freeze-dried twice to remove NH4HCO3. Preparation of Heparin Tetrasaccharides Desulfated at a Single Specific Ring Position-Hexasulfated heparin dp4 was subjected to specific desulfations at either 2-O, 6-O, or N positions using the procedures previously described for intact heparin (23Catlow K.R. Deakin J.A. Wei Z. Delehedde M. Fernig D.G. Gherardi E. Gallagher J.T. Pavaño M.S.G. Lyon M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5235-5248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The specifically desulfated dp4s were separated from partially and over-desulfated species on a semipreparative ProPac PA1 SAX-HPLC column as described earlier. Individual species were desalted on PD10 columns, and their compositions were checked by disaccharide analysis. Preparation of N-Sulfated Heparin Tetrasaccharide-Completely de-N/O-sulfated/re-N-sulfated heparin in 50 mm sodium acetate, 0.5 mm calcium acetate, pH 7.0, was digested with 0.2 IU/ml each of heparinases I, II, and III. Digestion was allowed to proceed at room temperature until the resulting dp2 and dp4 species constituted more than 50% of the total products (as assessed by chromatography of an aliquot upon a Superdex Peptide column, as described earlier). The dp4s, recovered by Superdex Peptide gel filtration, were freeze-dried and subjected to disaccharide compositional analysis. Preparation of 2-O- or 6-O-Sulfated Heparin Tetrasaccharides-Porcine intestinal heparin was subjected to either (i) de-6-O sulfation, with concomitant de-N sulfation, followed by re-N acetylation or (ii) de-2-O sulfation followed by sequential de-N sulfation and re-N acetylation, essentially as described in Catlow et al. (23Catlow K.R. Deakin J.A. Wei Z. Delehedde M. Fernig D.G. Gherardi E. Gallagher J.T. Pavaño M.S.G. Lyon M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5235-5248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Each product was partially digested with heparinases, and the dp4 pool was collected by gel filtration and then subfractionated by SAX-HPLC as described for singly desulfated heparin dp4s (above). Compositions were checked by disaccharide analyses. Disaccharide Analysis of GAGs and Oligosaccharides-DS and heparin species were completely digested to disaccharides using chondroitinase ABC or a mixture of heparinases I, II, and III. The resulting disaccharides were separated on ThermoQuest Hypersil SAX-HPLC (4.6 × 240 mm; ThermoQuest Hypersil Division, Runcorn, UK) or ProPac PA1 SAX-HPLC (4 × 250 mm; Dionex) columns as previously described (23Catlow K.R. Deakin J.A. Wei Z. Delehedde M. Fernig D.G. Gherardi E. Gallagher J.T. Pavaño M.S.G. Lyon M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5235-5248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Columns were calibrated with known disaccharide standards. Fluorescent Labeling of Oligosaccharides and Gel Mobility Shift Assays-Oligosaccharides were tagged at their reducing ends with 2-aminoacridone (AMAC), as described in Lyon et al. (19Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Lietha D. Gherardi E. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43560-43567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For gel mobility shift assays (GMSA), AMAC-tagged oligosaccharides were preincubated with NK1 protein in a 1:1 ratio for 30 min in a total volume of 10 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Samples were electrophoresed on either agarose gels (1% (w/v)) or polyacrylamide gels (6% (w/v) for basic GMSA or 10% (w/v) for selection GMSA) at a constant 100 V for between 5 and 20 min (shorter times for basic GMSA but often longer for selection GMSA) and then imaged under UV light (19Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Lietha D. Gherardi E. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43560-43567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In selection GMSA experiments, NK1 is titrated against a fixed concentration of a mixture of two or more oligosaccharides (of equivalent molar concentrations); the molar concentration of NK1 is expressed relative to the total ligand concentration (i.e. a NK1/ligand ratio of 0.33 for a mixture of three ligands indicates that the NK1 molar concentration is equal to that of any single ligand species in the mixture). Reverse-phase Chromatography of AMAC-labeled Oligosaccharides-Bands of free AMAC oligosaccharides were excised from 1% agarose GMSA gels with a scalpel blade under UV visualization. Gel fragments were mixed end-over-end for 2 h in 1 ml of distilled water in a sealed tube to extract the bulk of the oligosaccharides. The supernatant was then freeze-dried, redissolved in 20 μl of water, and then applied to an Eclipse XDB C-18 reverse-phase HPLC column (4.6 × 150 mm; Agilent Technologies, Stockport, UK) pre-equilibrated in 0.1 m ammonium acetate (Solution A). After a short and steep 2-ml gradient of 0–10% solution B (100% methanol), the oligosaccharide components were resolved over a 50-ml linear gradient of 10–30% solution B at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, with in-line monitoring of AMAC fluorescence (excitation at 425 nm, emission at 520 nm). Assay for Activation of ERK-MAPK in GAG-deficient Cells- GAG-deficient CHO pgsA-745 mutant cells were cultured as previously described (8Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1040-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Cells were serum-starved for 2 h before treatment with HGF/SF with or without oligosaccharides (when combined, they were preincubated for 30 min before the addition to the cells). Downstream signaling was assayed 20 min after reagent addition. Cell lysate preparation, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting using a mouse monoclonal antibody against dual-phosphorylated (Thr183/202/Tyr185/204) ERK-1/2 MAPKs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were performed as previously described (8Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1040-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). NMR Titrations-Concentrations of 15N-labeled NK1 used in the GAG titrations were 50 and 44 μm when titrated with heparin dp4 and DS dp6, respectively. Titration points were recorded at protein-oligosaccharide ratios of 1:1 and 1:2 for heparin dp4, whereas for the DS dp6 the ratios used were 1:0.5, 1:1, and 1:2.5. All spectra were recorded in 20 mm sodium acetate, 100 mm sodium chloride, pH 6.0, at 30 °C on an 800-MHz Avance NMR spectrometer. Spectra were processed using AZARA (Version 2.7, Wayne Boucher and Dept. of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge), and the chemical shift changes were quantified using ANALYSIS (28Vranken W.F. Boucher W. Stevens T.J. Fogh R.H. Pajon A. Llinas M. Ulrich E. Markley J.L. Ionides J. Laue E.D. Proteins. 2005; 59: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (2363) Google Scholar). NK1 Binding to Heparin and DS Tetrasaccharides-Previous studies had reported that a dp4 was the smallest even-numbered heparin oligosaccharide with affinity for HGF/SF and NK1 (18Delehedde M. Lyon M. Vidyasagar R. McDonnell T.J. Fernig D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12456-12462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 19Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Lietha D. Gherardi E. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43560-43567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). By contrast, a dp6 appeared to be the minimal DS oligosaccharide (19Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Lietha D. Gherardi E. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43560-43567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This size difference in the recognition of these two GAGs has now been revisited. dp4s were generated from heparin by limited heparinase I digestion followed by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1A). The major dp4 species, corresponding to the hexasulfated ΔHexA(2S)-GlcNS(6S)-IdoA(2S)-GlcNS(6S), was further purified by SAX-HPLC (Fig. 1C), and its composition and sequence were confirmed by disaccharide analysis and NMR (not shown). A porcine intestinal mucosal DS preparation with a high IdoA content (indicated by its substantial resistance to chondroitinase ACI digestion) but only a low level of 2-O sulfation of these IdoA residues was partially fragmented by complete chondroitinase ACI digestion followed by partial chondroitinase ABC scission. The dp4 pool was recovered by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1B). Fractionation of this pool by SAX-HPLC (Fig. 1D) yielded a major disulfated species (∼75% total) that disaccharide analysis revealed to be comprised predominantly of 4-O-sulfated disaccharides (92.5% 4-O-sulfates and 7.5% 6-O-sulfates, with no detectable 2-O-sulfates), i.e. corresponding primarily to the sequence ΔHexA-GalNAc(4S)-IdoA-GalNAc(4S). Both heparin and DS dp4s were labeled with AMAC, and their interaction with NK1 was assessed by GMSA. As previously demonstrated (19Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Lietha D. Gherardi E. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43560-43567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the heparin dp4 bound strongly to NK1 and was retained in the well (Fig. 2A). The DS dp4 also bound but required higher concentrations of NK1 than the heparin (Fig. 2B) and higher than used in the previous study (19Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Lietha D. Gherardi E. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43560"

Aspartyl intramembrane cleaving proteases of the GXGD-type play an important regulatory role in health and disease.

Genet. 2003; 12: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) as well as the Alzheimer's disease-associated presenilins (PS1 or PS2) are intramembrane-cleaving proteases (ICLiPs) of the GXGD-type aspartyl protease family (4Haass C.

Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 71-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). GXGD designates a novel active site motif located within transmembrane domain (TMD) 7 of all known intramembrane-cleaving aspartyl proteases (6Steiner H. Kostka M. Romig H. Basset G. Pesold B. Hardy J. Capell A. Meyn L. Grim M.G. Baumeister R. Fechteler K. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 848-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The GXGD motif contains one of the two critical aspartyl residues conserved in all GXGD-type proteases. The second aspartyl residue is part of a conserved YD motif located in TMD 6. Both motifs share no homologies with conventional aspartyl proteases (6Steiner H. Kostka M. Romig H. Basset G. Pesold B. Hardy J. Capell A. Meyn L. Grim M.G. Baumeister R. Fechteler K. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 848-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). SPP/SPPLs and PSs only share very limited sequence homologies (2Ponting C.P. Hutton M. Nyborg A. Baker M. Jansen K. Golde T.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1037-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar); however, besides the YD and GXGD domain, a third more C-terminal PAL sequence is conserved among all members of the GXGD proteases (2Ponting C.P. Hutton M. Nyborg A. Baker M. Jansen K. Golde T.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1037-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Recently it has been shown that the PAL motif may not only present a binding site for transition state inhibitors of γ-secretase and SPP (7Wang J. Beher D. Nyborg A.C. Shearman M.S. Golde T.E. Goate A. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), but, at least in the case of PS1, may interact with the N-terminal critical aspartate located within TMD 6 (8Tolia A. Horré K.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 12081-12088Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), these findings suggest a water-filled cavity harboring the catalytic center of γ-secretase. For SPP/SPPL family members, no such analyses have been performed yet; therefore it is too early to speculate whether similar structural features as observed for PS1 also apply. Although SPP/SPPLs apparently exert protease function in the absence of additional essential co-factors (1Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B.

Chem. 2007; 282: 20172-20179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), γ-secretase is a protease complex composed of PS and three additional proteins, Nicastrin (NCT), APH-1 (APH-1a L/S or APH-1b), and PEN-2 (17Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). All four proteins are necessary and sufficient for authentic γ-secretase function (18Edbauer D. Winkler E. Regula J.T. Pesold B. Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). PS harbors the active site aspartyl residues and the interacting PAL motif, whereas NCT is discussed as a substrate receptor (19Shah S. Lee S.F. Tabuchi K. Hao Y.H. Yu C. LaPlant Q. Ball H. Dann 3rd, C.E. Sudhof T. Yu G. Cell. 2005; 122: 435-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), and PEN-2 is discussed as a stabilizing factor keeping the auto-proteolytically generated PS fragments in close contact (20Prokop S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 46455-46463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). No function has so far been assigned to APH-1. SPP was discovered as an ICLiP responsible for removing hydrophobic signal peptides liberated from the N terminus of secreted or transmembrane proteins by signal peptidase (SP) cleavage during their co-translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (1Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). In addition to signal peptide degradation, SPP is also required for the generation of cell surface histocompatibility antigen-E epitopes and processing of the hepatitis C virus polyprotein (5Weihofen A. Martoglio B. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 71-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). A data base search for SPP homologues revealed SPPL2a, b, and c and SPPL3 (2Ponting C.P. Hutton M. Nyborg A. Baker M. Jansen K. Golde T.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1037-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 3Martoglio B. Golde T.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Currently, little is known about the function of SPPL family members. No physiological substrates are known for SPPL3 and SPPL2c. In contrast, three substrates have been identified to be processed by SPPL2a/b. These include tumor necrosis factor α (14Fluhrer R. Grammer G. Israel L. Condron M.M. Haffner C. Friedmann E.

Lichtenthaler S.F. Kuhn P.H. Stauffer D. Rovelli G. Martoglio B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), the Fas ligand (FasL) (23Kirkin V. Cahuzac N. Guardiola-Serrano F. Huault S. Luckerath K. Friedmann E. Novac N. Wels W.S. Martoglio B. Hueber A.O. Zornig M. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1678-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and Bri2 (Itm2b) (24Martin L. Fluhrer R. Reiss K. Kremmer E. Saftig P. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1644-1652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In the case of tumor necrosis factor α, reverse signaling has been observed upon liberation of the intracellular domain (ICD) by SPPL2a and SPPL2b (22Friedmann E. Hauben E. Maylandt K. Schleeger S. Vreugde S. Lichtenthaler S.F. Kuhn P.H. Stauffer D. Rovelli G. Martoglio B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The tumor necrosis factor α ICD regulates expression of interleukin-12 probably via nuclear signaling (22Friedmann E. Hauben E. Maylandt K. Schleeger S. Vreugde S. Lichtenthaler S.F. Kuhn P.H. Stauffer D. Rovelli G. Martoglio B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Similarly, the ICD of FasL negatively regulates gene transcription (23Kirkin V. Cahuzac N. Guardiola-Serrano F. Huault S. Luckerath K. Friedmann E. Novac N. Wels W.S. Martoglio B. Hueber A.O. Zornig M. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1678-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Consistent with its predominant function in signal peptide removal, SPP is located within the endoplasmic reticulum (15Krawitz P. Haffner C. Fluhrer R. Steiner H. Schmid B. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39515-39523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 22Friedmann E. Hauben E. Maylandt K. Schleeger S. Vreugde S. Lichtenthaler S.F. Kuhn P.H. Stauffer D. Rovelli G. Martoglio B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and probably retained by a KKXX retention signal. SPPL3 (15Krawitz P. Haffner C. Fluhrer R. Steiner H. Schmid B. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39515-39523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and SPPL2c (22Friedmann E. Hauben E. Maylandt K. Schleeger S. Vreugde S. Lichtenthaler S.F. Kuhn P.H. Stauffer D. Rovelli G. Martoglio B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) are also located within the endoplasmic reticulum, and it is tempting to speculate that they are involved in signal peptide removal like SPP. In contrast, SPPL2a and SPPL2b occur throughout the secretory pathway including the plasma membrane and endosomes/lysosomes (15Krawitz P. Haffner C. Fluhrer R. Steiner H. Schmid B. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39515-39523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This suggests that the differential subcellular localization of SPPL proteases restricts the number of available substrates. In contrast to γ-secretase, which only accepts type 1 transmembrane proteins as substrates for intramembrane proteolysis (17Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 25Steiner H. Curr. Alzheimer Res. 2008; 5: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), all currently known SPP/SPPL substrates are in type 2 orientation (1Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 5Weihofen A. Martoglio B.

Saftig P. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1644-1652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). For γ-secretase and other ICLiPs, it has been shown that intramembrane proteolysis strictly follows a previous ectodomain shedding event. Shedding removes the bulk of the ectodomain and leaves behind a small membrane-retained stub. In the case of γ-secretase, substrates with an ectodomain shorter than ∼50 amino acids are preferentially processed (26Struhl G. Adachi A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Moreover, only pre-shed substrates bind to γ-secretase (27Esler W.P. Kimberly W.T. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Diehl T.S. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2720-2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), whereas full-length proteins are most likely not recognized. Substrate recognition via its free N terminus is apparently mediated by NCT through a conserved glutamate residue (19Shah S. Lee S.F. Tabuchi K. Hao Y.H. Yu C. LaPlant Q. Ball H. Dann 3rd, C.E. Sudhof T. Yu G. Cell. 2005; 122: 435-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), although this finding has recently been challenged (28Chavez-Gutierrez L. Tolia A. Maes E. Li T. Wong P.C. de Strooper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20096-20105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). SPP may also require precleavage of its substrate by SP (1Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 29Lemberg M.K. Martoglio B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar); however, even upon mutagenesis of the SP recognition site, some residual intramembrane proteolysis still occurs (29Lemberg M.K. Martoglio B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In line with the possibility that full-length substrates may be cleaved at least to some extent, SPPL2b was shown to co-immunoprecipitate both the truncated substrate and the full-length precursor (14Fluhrer R. Grammer G. Israel L. Condron M.M. Haffner C. Friedmann E. Bohland C. Imhof A. Martoglio B. Teplow D.B. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 894-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 24Martin L. Fluhrer R. Reiss K. Kremmer E. Saftig P. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1644-1652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, the fact that substantially more full-length protein co-immunoprecipitates with the active SPPL2b protein as compared with the truncated fragment suggested that the latter may be preferentially turned over by intramembrane proteolysis (14Fluhrer R. Grammer G. Israel L. Condron M.M. Haffner C. Friedmann E. Bohland C. Imhof A. Martoglio B. Teplow D.B. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 894-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 24Martin L. Fluhrer R. Reiss K. Kremmer E. Saftig P. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1644-1652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It is also not known whether primary sequences within the TMD or adjacent domains of SPPL2b substrates are critical for substrate recognition and turnover. Bri3 as well as Bri2, which is genetically associated with Familial British and Danish dementia, belong to the family of highly homologous Bri proteins (30Choi S.C. Kim J. Kim T.H. Cho S.Y. Park S.S. Kim K.D. Lee S.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 12: 391-397Google Scholar). We demonstrate that, although very homologous to Bri2, Bri3 is not a substrate for regulated intramembrane proteolysis. This finding allowed us to study intramembrane proteolysis independent of ectodomain shedding. We demonstrate that shedding greatly facilitates subsequent intramembrane proteolysis. However, truncation of the ectodomain of a potential SPPL2b substrate is surprisingly not sufficient to allow intramembrane proteolysis, because in addition to removal of the bulk of the ectodomain, sequence determinants within the ICD, the TMD, and the luminal juxtamembrane domain (JMD) are also required. Cell Culture, cDNAs, and Transfection—HEK-293EBNA (HEK-293) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Glutamax (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). HEK-293 single cell clones stably expressing SPPL2b or SPPL2b D421A containing a C-terminal hemagglutinin tag (AYPYDVPDYA) have been described before (24Martin L. Fluhrer R. Reiss K. Kremmer E. Saftig P. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1644-1652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Bri2 and Bri3 cDNAs were purchased from Deutsches Ressourcezentrum für Genomforschung (Berlin, Germany). cDNAs encoding chimeric proteins (Table 1) were generated by PCR. For all constructs the propetide at the C terminus was removed, and a N-terminal FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) as well as a C-terminal V5 tag (GKPIPNPLLGLDST) was added. Sequences of the oligonucleotides used for PCR are available upon request. PCR products were subcloned into the HindIII and XbaI sites of pcDNA6.0-V5-His A (Invitrogen). All of the cDNA constructs were verified by sequencing. Transient transfection of HEK-293 cell lines stably expressing the indicated SPPL2b variants was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

The monoclonal anti-Giantin antibody (ALX-804–600) was obtained from Alexa (AXXORA Deutschland GmbH, Lörach, Germany). 22C11 antibody recognizing the N terminus of APP was purchased from Chemicon (Schwalbach, Germany). Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Immunoprecipitation assays, gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting experiments, and assays were carried out as described previously (14Fluhrer R. Grammer G. Israel L. Condron M.M. Haffner C.

Immunocytochemistry and Confocal Imaging—The indicated cell lines were grown on polylysine-coated glass coverslips to 60–80% confluence and processed for immunofluorescence as described before (15Krawitz P.

Cells were treated with 0.1% Triton to perform co-staining with the Golgi marker giantin or were left untreated to perform surface stainings. Confocal images were obtained with Zeiss 510Meta confocal laser scanning microscope system equipped with a 100/1.3 objective described previously (31Kaether C. Capell A. Edbauer D. Winkler E. Novak B. Steiner H. Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4738-4748Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The images were assembled and processed using Adobe Illustrator. Inhibitor Treatment and Quantification—To inhibit SPPL2b, the cells were treated overnight with a final concentration of 30 μm (Z-LL)2-ketone (Calbiochem), a known SPP/SPPL inhibitor (32Weihofen A.

For quantification, the proteins were immunoblotted as described above and detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence technique (GE Healthcare). The chemiluminescence signals of at least three independent experiments were measured with a CD camera-based imaging system (Alpha Innotec). Statistical significance was determined with Student's t test. Statistical significant p values <0.05, <0.005, and <0.0005 are represented by *, **, and ***, respectively. Alignment and Sequence Analysis—Bri2 and Bri3 protein sequences were aligned using VectorNTI 9 (Invitrogen). Amino acid identity and similarity were calculated using EMBOSS pairwise alignment algorithms. Differential Shedding of Bri2 and Bri3—Although substrate requirements for γ-secretase (Ref. 26Struhl G.

Therefore we specifically searched for substrate requirements of SPPL2b, an ICLiP of the GXGD-type located within the late secretory compartments including plasma membrane and endosomes, because this may allow a direct comparison of the properties of γ-secretase with those of the SPPLs.

Chem. 2008; 283: 1644-1652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), the BRICHOS domain was efficiently shed upon transfection of Bri2 (Fig. 1B). Shedding occurred independent of the expression of wt SPPL2b or nonfunctional SPPL2b D/A. As expected, we also detected the Bri2 N-terminal fragment (Bri2 NTF) generated by the shedding event within the cell lysate (Fig. 1B). As observed before (24Martin L. Fluhrer R. Reiss K. Kremmer E. Saftig P. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1644-1652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), the shedding event appeared to be heterogeneous because multiple NTFs of slightly different molecular weight are detected. The Bri2 ICD was efficiently generated upon co-expression of the proteolytically active SPPL2b (Fig. 1B). In contrast, upon expression of the inactive SPPL2 D/A variant, the Bri2 NTF accumulated, and no Bri2 ICD was generated (Fig. 1B) (24Martin L. Fluhrer R. Reiss K. Kremmer E. Saftig P. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1644-1652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when we expressed the homologous Bri3, no secretion of the Bri3 BRICHOS domain was observed (Fig. 1B). This is in line with previous findings that also suggested that Bri3 fails to undergo shedding (35Wickham L. Benjannet S. Marcinkiewicz E. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Intramembrane proteolysis by SPPL2b was also not observed, as shown by the lack of detectable Bri3 ICD even after long exposure (Fig. 1B). This suggests that although Bri2 and Bri3 share substantial sequence similarities throughout their ectodomains (Fig. 1A), the shedding protease discriminates between these similar substrates. However, another possibility would be that Bri2 and Bri3 are differentially targeted and Bri3 does not reach sheddase/SPPL2b containing cellular compartments. To prove this possibility, we investigated the subcellular distribution of Bri2 and Bri3 by immunohistochemistry. This revealed that both Bri2 and Bri3 are similarly targeted through the secretory pathway and occur within giantin-positive Golgi compartments and on the plasma membrane (Fig. 1C), and thus both co-localize with SPPL2b (24Martin L.

Consistent with this, most viruses require RIG-I to mount an innate immune response, whereas picornaviruses require mda-5. We have examined a SeV infection whose ability to induce interferon depends on the generation of capped dsRNA (without free 5′ tri-phosphate ends), and found that this infection as well requires RIG-I and not mda-5. We also provide evidence that RIG-I interacts with poly-I/C in vivo, and that heteropolymeric dsRNA and poly-I/C interact directly with RIG-I in vitro, but in different ways; i.e., poly-I/C has the unique ability to stimulate the helicase ATPase of RIG-I variants which lack the C-terminal regulatory domain."
https://openalex.org/W2002678747,"Background Human RNase P has been initially described as a tRNA processing enzyme, consisting of H1 RNA and at least ten distinct protein subunits. Recent findings, however, indicate that this catalytic ribonucleoprotein is also required for transcription of small noncoding RNA genes by RNA polymerase III (Pol III). Notably, subunits of human RNase P are localized in the nucleolus, thus raising the possibility that this ribonucleoprotein complex is implicated in transcription of rRNA genes by Pol I. Methodology/Principal Findings By using biochemical and reverse genetic means we show here that human RNase P is required for efficient transcription of rDNA by Pol I. Thus, inactivation of RNase P by targeting its protein subunits for destruction by RNA interference or its H1 RNA moiety for specific cleavage causes marked reduction in transcription of rDNA by Pol I. However, RNase P restores Pol I transcription in a defined reconstitution system. Nuclear run on assays reveal that inactivation of RNase P reduces the level of nascent transcription by Pol I, and more considerably that of Pol III. Moreover, RNase P copurifies and associates with components of Pol I and its transcription factors and binds to chromatin of the promoter and coding region of rDNA. Strikingly, RNase P detaches from transcriptionally inactive rDNA in mitosis and reassociates with it at G1 phase through a dynamic and stepwise assembly process that is correlated with renewal of transcription. Conclusions/Significance Our findings reveal that RNase P activates transcription of rDNA by Pol I through a novel assembly process and that this catalytic ribonucleoprotein determines the transcription output of Pol I and Pol III, two functionally coordinated transcription machineries."
https://openalex.org/W2001719095,"With the advent of genome-wide association (GWA) studies, researchers are hoping that reliable genetic association of common human complex diseases/traits can be detected. Currently, there is an increasing enthusiasm about GWA and a number of GWA studies have been published. In the field a common practice is that replication should be used as the gold standard to validate an association finding. In this article, based on empirical and theoretical data, we emphasize that replication of GWA findings can be quite difficult, and should not always be expected, even when true variants are identified. The probability of replication becomes smaller with the increasing number of independent GWA studies if the power of individual replication studies is less than 100% (which is usually the case), and even a finding that is replicated may not necessarily be true. We argue that the field may have unreasonably high expectations on success of replication. We also wish to raise the question whether it is sufficient or necessary to treat replication as the ultimate and gold standard for defining true variants. We finally discuss the usefulness of integrating evidence from multiple levels/sources such as genetic epidemiological studies (at the DNA level), gene expression studies (at the RNA level), proteomics (at the protein level), and follow-up molecular and cellular studies for eventual validation and illumination of the functional relevance of the genes uncovered."
https://openalex.org/W2012875123,"Background Teleost fishes do not have a vomeronasal organ (VNO), and their vomeronasal receptors (V1Rs, V2Rs) are expressed in the main olfactory epithelium (MOE), as are odorant receptors (ORs) and trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs). In this study, to obtain insights into the functional distinction among the four chemosensory receptor families in teleost fishes, their evolutionary patterns were examined in zebrafish, medaka, stickleback, fugu, and spotted green pufferfish. Methodology/Principal Findings Phylogenetic analysis revealed that many lineage-specific gene gains and losses occurred in the teleost fish TAARs, whereas only a few gene gains and losses have taken place in the teleost fish vomeronasal receptors. In addition, synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution rate ratios (KA/KS) in TAARs tended to be higher than those in ORs and V2Rs. Conclusions/Significance Frequent gene gains/losses and high KA/KS in teleost TAARs suggest that receptors in this family are used for detecting some species-specific chemicals such as pheromones. Conversely, conserved repertoires of V1R and V2R families in teleost fishes may imply that receptors in these families perceive common odorants for teleosts, such as amino acids. Teleost ORs showed intermediate evolutionary pattern between TAARs and vomeronasal receptors. Many teleost ORs seem to be used for common odorants, but some ORs may have evolved to recognize lineage-specific odors."
https://openalex.org/W2054969359,"Mineralization in UMR 106-01 osteoblastic cultures occurs within extracellular biomineralization foci (BMF) within 12 h after addition of beta-glycerol phosphate to cells at 64 h after plating. BMF are identified by their enrichment with an 85-kDa glycoprotein reactive with Maackia amurensis lectin. Laser Raman microspectroscopic scans were made on individual BMF at times preceding (64-76 h) and following the appearance of mineral crystals (76-88 h). The range of variation between spectra for different BMF in the same culture was rather small. In contrast, significant differences were observed for spectral bands at 957-960, 1004, and 1660 cm(-1) when normalized BMF spectra at different times were compared. Protein-dependent spectral bands at 1004 and 1660 cm(-1) increased and then decreased preceding the detection of hydroxyapatite crystals via the phosphate stretching peak at 959-960 cm(-1). When sodium phosphate was substituted for beta-glycerol phosphate, mineralization occurred 3-6 h earlier. Irrespective of phosphate source, the Raman full peak width at half-maximum ratio for 88 h cultures was similar to that for 10-day-old marrow ablation primary bone. However, if mineralization was blocked with serine protease inhibitor 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 64-88-h BMF spectra remained largely invariant. In summary, Raman spectral data demonstrate for the first time that formation of hydroxyapatite crystals within individual BMF is a multistep process. Second, changes in protein-derived signals at 1004 and 1660 cm(-1) reflect events within BMFs that precede or accompany mineral crystal production because they are blocked by mineralization inhibitor 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride. Finally, the low extent of spectral variability detected among different BMF at the same time point indicates that mineralization of individual BMF within a culture is synchronized."
https://openalex.org/W2140825768,"SERPINA3K, an extracellular serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin), has been shown to have decreased levels in the retinas of diabetic rats, which may contribute to diabetic retinopathy. The function of SERPINA3K in the retina has not been investigated.The present study identified a novel function of SERPINA3K, i.e. it protects retinal cells against oxidative stress-induced cell death including retinal neuronal cells and Müller cells. Flow-cytometry showed that the protective effect of SERPINA3K on Müller cells is via reducing oxidation-induced necrosis. Measurements of intracellular calcium concentration showed that SERPINA3K prevented the intracellular calcium overload induced by H(2)O(2). A similar protective effect was observed using a calcium chelator (BAPTA/AM). Further, SERPINA3K inhibited the phosphorylation of phospholipase C (PLC)-gamma1 induced by H(2)O(2). Likewise, a specific PLC inhibitor showed similar protective effects on Müller cells exposed to H(2)O(2). Furthermore, the protective effect of SERPINA3K was attenuated by a specific PLC activator (m-3M3FBS). Finally, in a binding assay, SERPINA3K displayed saturable and specific binding on Müller cells.These results for the first time demonstrate that SERPINA3K is an endogenous serpin which protects cells from oxidative stress-induced cells death, and its protective effect is via blocking the calcium overload through the PLC pathway. The decreased retinal levels of SERPINA3K may represent a new pathogenic mechanism for the retinal Müller cell dysfunction and neuron loss in diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2016586181,"PDZK1 is a four PDZ domain-containing scaffold protein that binds to scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI), the high density lipoprotein receptor, by its first PDZ domain (PDZ1). PDZK1 knock-out mice exhibit a >95% decrease in hepatic SR-BI protein and consequently an approximately 70% increase in plasma cholesterol in abnormally large high density lipoprotein particles. These defects are corrected by hepatic overexpression of full-length PDZK1 but not the PDZ1 domain alone, which partially restores SR-BI protein abundance but not cell surface expression or function. We have generated PDZK1 knock-out mice with hepatic expression of four PDZK1 transgenes encoding proteins with nested C-terminal truncations: pTEM, which lacks the three C-terminal residues (putative PDZ-binding motif), and PDZ1.2, PDZ1.2.3, or PDZ1.2.3.4, which contain only the first two, three, or four N-terminal PDZ domains, respectively, but not the remaining C-terminal sequences. Hepatic overexpression of pTEM restored normal hepatic SR-BI abundance, localization, and function. Hepatic overexpression of PDZ1.2 or PDZ1.2.3 partially restored SR-BI abundance ( approximately 12 or approximately 30% of wild type, respectively) but did not (PDZ1.2) or only slightly (PDZ1.2.3) restored hepatic SR-BI cell surface localization and function. Hepatic overexpression of PDZ1.2.3.4 completely restored SR-BI protein abundance, cell surface expression, and function (normalization of plasma cholesterol levels). Thus, all four PDZ domains in PDZK1, but not PDZ1-3 alone, are sufficient for its normal control of the abundance, localization, and therefore function of hepatic SR-BI, whereas the residues C-terminal to the PDZ4 domain, including the C-terminal putative PDZ-binding domain, are not required."
https://openalex.org/W2062469541,"It was recently suggested that specific antidepressants of the serotonin-antagonist type, namely mianserin and methiothepin, may exert anti-aging properties and specifically extend lifespan of the nematode C.elegans by causing a state of perceived calorie restriction (Petrascheck M, Ye X, Buck LB: An antidepressant that extends lifespan in adult Caenorhabditis elegans; Nature, Nov 22, 2007;450(7169):553-6, PMID 18033297). Using the same model organism, we instead observe a reduction of life expectancy when employing the commonly used, standardized agar-based solid-phase assay while applying the same or lower concentrations of the same antidepressants. Consistent with a well-known side-effect of these compounds in humans, antidepressants not only reduced lifespan but also increased body fat accumulation in C. elegans reflecting the mammalian phenotype. Taken together and in conflict with previously published findings, we find that antidepressants of the serotonin-antagonist type not only promote obesity, but also decrease nematode lifespan."
https://openalex.org/W2064694702,"The mitochondrial RNA polymerase (mtRNAP) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, consisting of a complex of Rpo41 and Mtf1, is homologous to the phage single polypeptide T7/T3 RNA polymerases. The yeast mtRNAP recognizes a conserved nonanucleotide sequence to initiate specific transcription. In this work, we have defined the region of the nonanucleotide that is melted by the mtRNAP using 2-aminopurine (2AP) fluorescence that is sensitive to changes in base stacking interactions. We show that mtRNAP spontaneously melts the promoter from -4 to +2 forming a bubble around the transcription start site at +1. The location and size of the DNA bubble in this open complex of the mtRNAP closely resembles that of the T7 RNA polymerase. We show that DNA melting requires the simultaneous presence of Rpo41 and Mtf1. Adding the initiating nucleotide ATP does not expand the size of the initially melted DNA, but the initiating nucleotide differentially affects base stacking interactions at -1 and -2. Thus, the promoter structure upstream of the transcription start site is slightly rearranged during early initiation from its structure in the pre-initiation stage. Unlike on the duplex promoter, Rpo41 alone was able to form a competent open complex on a pre-melted promoter. The results indicate that Rpo41 contains the elements for recognizing the melted promoter through interactions with the template strand. We propose that Mtf1 plays a role in base pair disruption during the early stages of open complex formation."
https://openalex.org/W2015080160,"It is generally thought that during the contraction phase of an acute anti-viral T cell reponse, the effector T cells that escape activation-induced cell death eventually differentiate into central memory T cells over the next several weeks. Here we report that antigen-specific CD8T cells with the phenotype and function of central memory cells develop concomitantly with effector T cells during vaccinia virus (vv) infection. As soon as 5 days after an intraperitoneal infection with vv, we could identify a subset of CD44hi and CD62L+ vv-specific CD8 T cells in the peritoneal exudate lymphocytes. This population constituted approximately 10% of all antigen-specific T cells and like central memory T cells, they also expressed high levels of CCR7 and IL-7R but expressed little granzyme B. Importantly, upon adoptive transfer into naïve congenic hosts, CD62L+, but not CD62L− CD8 T cells were able to expand and mediate a rapid recall response to a new vv challenge initiated 6 weeks after transfer, confirming that the CD62L+ vv-specific CD8 T cells are bonafide memory cells. Our results are thus consistent with the branched differentiation model, where effector and memory cells develop simultaneously. These results are likely to have implications in the context of vaccine design, particularly those based on vaccinia virus recombinants."
https://openalex.org/W2026653078,"Background The policy to provide oral polio vaccine (OPV) at birth was introduced in low-income countries to increase coverage. The effect of OPV at birth on overall child mortality was never studied. During a trial of vitamin A supplementation (VAS) at birth in Guinea-Bissau, OPV was not available during several periods. We took advantage of this “natural experiment” to test the effect on mortality of receiving OPV at birth. Methodology Between 2002 and 2004, the VAS trial randomised normal-birth-weight infants to 50,000 IU VAS or placebo administered with BCG. Provision of OPV at birth was not part of the trial, but we noted whether the infants received OPV or not. OPV was missing during several periods in 2004. We used Cox proportional hazards models to compute mortality rate ratios (MRR) of children who had received or not received OPV at birth. Principal Findings A total of 962 (22.1%) of the 4345 enrolled children did not receive OPV at birth; 179 children died within the first year of life. Missing OPV at birth was associated with a tendency for decreased mortality (adjusted MRR = 0.69 (95% CI = 0.46–1.03)), the effect being similar among recipients of VAS and placebo. There was a highly significant interaction between OPV at birth and sex (p = 0.006). Not receiving OPV at birth was associated with a weak tendency for increased mortality in girls (1.14 (0.70–1.89)) but significantly decreased mortality in boys (0.35 (0.18–0.71)). Conclusions In our study OPV at birth had a sex-differential effect on mortality. Poliovirus is almost eradicated and OPV at birth contributes little to herd immunity. A randomised study of the effect of OPV at birth on overall mortality in both sexes is warranted."

Pus7p belongs to the universally conserved TruD-like family of RNA:Ψ-synthases found in bacteria, archaea, and eukarya. Although several RNA substrates for yeast Pus7p have been identified, specificity of their recognition and modification has not been studied. However, conservation of a 7-nt-long sequence, including the modified U residue, in all natural Pus7p substrates suggested the importance of these nucleotides for Pus7p recognition and/or catalysis. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we designed a set of RNA variants derived from the yeast tRNAAsp(GUC), pre-tRNATyr(GΨA), and U2 small nuclear RNA and tested their ability to be modified by Pus7p in vitro. We demonstrated that the highly conserved U-2 and A+1 residues (nucleotide numbers refer to target U0) are crucial identity elements for efficient modification by Pus7p. Nucleotide substitutions at other surrounding positions (-4, -3, +2, +3) have only a moderate effect. Surprisingly, the identity of the nucleotide immediately 5′ to the target U0 residue (position -1) is not important for efficient modification.

However, our results suggest that the presence of at least one stem-loop structure including or close to the target U nucleotide is required for Pus7p-catalyzed modification. RNA:pseudouridine (Ψ)-synthases catalyze the post-transcriptional U to Ψ conversion in RNAs. Extensive studies during the last 10 years allowed the discovery and characterization of almost the complete set of bacterial and yeast enzymes responsible for this modification in tRNAs, rRNAs, and small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). 3The abbreviations used are: snRNA, small nuclear RNA; WT, wild type; nt, nucleotide(s). All known RNA:Ψ-synthases share a set of conserved amino acid sequence motifs and can be grouped into six distinct families based on the degree of amino acid sequence homology: families related to TruA, TruB, RluA, RsuA, TruD, and PsuX, respectively (1Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2411-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 2Kaya Y. Ofengand J. RNA. 2003; 9: 711-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 3Roovers M. Hale C. Tricot C.

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA:Ψ-synthase Pus7p belongs to the recently described TruD-related family of proteins whose members are conserved in all kingdoms of life but have no apparent sequence homology with the other RNA:Ψ-synthases. However, strong homologies were found at the level of the three-dimensional structure of the catalytic site (2Kaya Y. Ofengand J. RNA. 2003; 9: 711-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Pus7p was initially fished out in a high throughput screening aiming to characterize U2 snRNA-specific pseudouridylation activity. By this approach, Ψ35-forming activity in U2 snRNA was attributed to the YOR243c open reading frame, designed as the PUS7 (pseudouridine synthase 7) gene (4Ma X. Zhao X. Yu Y.T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1889-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Later, by analysis of in vivo RNA modification defects resulting from deletion of the PUS7 gene and by in vitro tests using the recombinant protein, we identified other targets of the Pus7p enzyme (U13 in several yeast cytoplasmic tRNAs and U35 in the intron-containing pre-tRNATyr(GΨA)) (5Behm-Ansmant I. Urban A. Ma X. Yu Y.T. Motorin Y. Branlant C. RNA. 2003; 9: 1371-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Recently, the activity of Pus7p at position 50 in 5 S rRNA was also demonstrated (6Decatur W.A. Schnare M.N. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 3089-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The activity of the Escherichia coli homologue of the yeast Pus7p (TruD protein) (2Kaya Y. Ofengand J. RNA. 2003; 9: 711-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) was also characterized. Since U35 in the bacterial tRNATyr(GUA) is not converted to Ψ and since snRNAs do not exist in these organisms, the activity of the bacterial TruD enzyme seems to be restricted to U13 conversion in tRNAs (2Kaya Y. Ofengand J. RNA. 2003; 9: 711-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). TruD-like proteins are also present in archaea. However, their activity and specificity have not been studied up to now. The rules governing RNA substrate recognition by RNA:Ψ-synthases and RNA:modification enzymes in general have only been elucidated in a few cases (for a review, see Ref. 7Hur S. Stroud R.M. Finer-Moore J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38969-38973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Some of the characterized RNA:Ψ-synthases have a rather strict substrate specificity and are only able to modify one position in only one type of cellular RNA, such as, for instance, tRNAs or even in only one cellular RNA, like rRNA. This is the case for several of the characterized yeast RNA:Ψ-synthases. Pus5p modifies a unique position in the mitochondrial 21 S rRNA (8Ansmant I. Massenet S. Grosjean H. Motorin Y. Branlant C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1941-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), Pus6p modifies only position 31 in both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNAs (9Ansmant I. Motorin Y. Massenet S. Grosjean H. Branlant C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34934-34940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and Pus8p and Pus9p modify position 32 in the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNAs, respectively (10Behm-Ansmant I. Grosjean H. Massenet S. Motorin Y. Branlant C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52998-53006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Finally, Pus4p, which converts the universally conserved U55 residue into a Ψ residue in all elongator tRNAs (11Becker H.F. Motorin Y. Planta R.J. Grosjean H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4493-4499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is the only one well studied example of RNA:Ψ-synthase acting at a unique position in tRNAs. It was demonstrated that this strict substrate specificity depends on the universally conserved G53UUCNANNC60 sequence in most tRNAs and on the particular three-dimensional structure of the TΨC loop, which is stabilized by a reverse Hoogsteen interaction between residues U54 and A58. Mutations, introduced at any of the conserved positions, completely abolished or considerably reduced the modification efficiency (12Becker H.F. Motorin Y. Sissler M. Florentz C. Grosjean H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Very similar results were also obtained for bacterial TruB (13Gu X. Yu M. Ivanetich K.M. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity of other characterized yeast RNA:Ψ-synthases, Pus5p, Pus6p, Pus8p, and Pus9p enzymes, was not studied in detail, so that the sequence and structure requirements for activity of these enzymes are not known. In contrast to the yeast RNA:Ψ-synthases Pus4p, Pus5p, Pus6p, Pus8p, and Pus9p, both Pus1p and Pus7p are peculiar in acting on different types of substrates: eight positions in tRNAs and position 44 in U2 snRNA for Pus1p (14Massenet S.

Yu Y.T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1889-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 5Behm-Ansmant I. Urban A. Ma X. Yu Y.T. Motorin Y. Branlant C.

One can ask the question how RNA:Ψ-synthase Pus7p can recognize such different substrates with a high degree of specificity. These substrate RNAs have different size, sequence, and also different two- and three-dimensional structures. RNA substrate specificity of yeast Pus1p was not systematically studied, but, taken together, the previously published and unpublished observations indicate that Pus1p modifies multiple accessible uridines in a flexible segment between two RNA helices or even at the extremity of the helix (14Massenet S.

RNA. 2006; 12: 1583-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In some cases, the preference for a purine residue immediately 3′ to the modified U was observed, but this tendency seems not be general for all Pus1p substrates. RNA regions modified by Pus7p also show no obvious common features at the level of the two-dimensional structure: U13 in cytoplasmic tRNAs, U35 in the pre-tRNATyr(GΨA), and U50 in 5 S rRNA are located in helical regions according to the two-dimensional structures proposed for these RNAs (Fig. 1) (17Moras D.

Genomics. 2005; 274: 235-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In tRNAs, the stability of these helices are quite low. For yeast 5 S rRNA, several alternative two-dimensional structures have been proposed (see Fig. 1A) (20Nishikawa K. Takemura S. FEBS Lett. 1974; 40: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 21Smith M.W. Meskauskas A. Wang P. Sergiev P.V. Dinman J.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 8264-8275Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The base-pairing patterns differ in the region covering Ψ50, and this nucleotide appears to be unpaired in the unified two-dimensional structure proposed for eukaryotic 5 S rRNA (22Szymanski M. Barciszewska M.Z. Erdmann V.A. Barciszewski J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 176-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In contrast, U35 in U2 snRNA is located in a single-stranded RNA region (23Branlant C. Krol A. Ebel J.P. Lazar E. Haendler B. Jacob M. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 1259-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 24Ares Jr., M. Cell. 1986; 47: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, inspection of the Pus7p RNA targets in S. cerevisiae revealed a high conservation of a 7-nt-long sequence, including the target U residue (5Behm-Ansmant I. Urban A. Ma X. Yu Y.T. Motorin Y. Branlant C. RNA. 2003; 9: 1371-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The newly identified Pus7p target in 5 S rRNA (U50) is also surrounded by the same conserved sequence (6Decatur W.A. Schnare M.N. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 3089-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Site-directed mutagenesis of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana pre-tRNATyr(GΨA), which also contains an intron and is pseudouridylated at position 35 had revealed the importance of the U33N34U35A36Pu37 sequence for efficient Ψ35 formation in a wheat germ and HeLa extracts (25Szweykowska-Kulinska Z. Beier H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1907-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To test whether the sequence recognition is a general feature of the eukaryal Pus7-like enzymes and if the conserved residues have an equal importance in different types of RNA substrates, we produced variants of each of the yeast Pus7p substrates (tRNAAsp(GUC), pre-tRNATyr(GΨA), and U2 snRNA) with base substitutions at positions -4, -3, -2, -1, +1, +2, or +3 and compared the activity of the recombinant Pus7p on these variant RNAs. Since the cytoplasmic tRNAAla(ICG), which contains the conserved 7-nt long sequence including position 13, except for a C to U substitution at position -2, is not pseudouridylated at position 13 in vivo, we tested whether it can be modified in vitro after C11U substitution. Several mitochondrial tRNAs also have a sequence around the U13 residue that fits to the consensus sequence of the Pus7p substrates. Therefore, we also tested the in vitro activity of recombinant Pus7p on these tRNAs. Finally, we produced several variants of the tRNAAsp(GUC), pre-tRNATyr(GΨA) and U2 snRNA substrates of Pus7p that were designed in order to modify their two- and three-dimensional structures. Then we tested the activity of the recombinant Pus7p on these RNA variants. Altogether, the data obtained for all three types of Pus7p RNA substrates tested in this study demonstrate that two highly conserved residues around the target U are most important for Pus7p modification and that other conserved or semiconserved residues have a modulator effect on the activity, depending on the identity of the RNA. Furthermore, the presence of some stable RNA two-dimensional structure elements was found to reinforce the activity, whereas a highly compact three-dimensional structure may decrease the action of Pus7p. Strains and Plasmids—The haploid yeast strain BY4742 MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 from the EUROSCARF collection was used as a source of genomic DNA for PCR amplification. The plasmids used for in vitro transcription of tRNAAsp(GUC) and its mutants ΔTΨ-SL, MC3, and MC4 were kindly provided by C. Florentz (IBMC, Strasbourg, France). The construct bearing the sequence of S. cerevisiae pre-tRNATyr(GΨA) under the control of T7 promoter was described previously (5Behm-Ansmant I. Urban A. Ma X. Yu Y.T. Motorin Y. Branlant C. RNA. 2003; 9: 1371-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Plasmid pT7U2Sc, kindly provided by P. Fabrizio, was used for in vitro transcription of S. cerevisiae U2 snRNA fragment 1-139 (14Massenet S. Motorin Y. Lafontaine D.L. Hurt E.C. Grosjean H. Branlant C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 2142-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Other sequences of tRNA genes used in the study were PCR-amplified and inserted into the SmaI site of pUC19, along with the T7 promoter sequence at 5′ and BstNI (MvaI) restriction site at 3′. Deletion of the 14-nt intron from pre-tRNATyr(GΨA) construct was performed by PCR, using the following primers: 5′-ATCTTGAGATCGGGCGTTCGACTCGCCCCCG-3′ and 5′-TTACAGTCTTGCGCCTTAAACCAACTTGG-3′. Amplified linear DNA was self-ligated and used to transform competent E. coli cells. DNA matrices for in vitro transcription of minisubstrates and U2 snRNA truncated variants were produced by PCR or annealing of complementary DNA oligonucleotides. The forward primers used for PCR amplification generated the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. All variants of tRNAAsp(GUC), pre-tRNATyr(GΨA), and U2 snRNA with point mutations were made by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The sequences of all the generated recombinant plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. In vitro T7 RNA polymerase transcription with or without incorporation of the appropriate [α-32P]NTP and purification of the resulting RNA transcripts by electrophoresis on denaturing gel were performed as previously described (5Behm-Ansmant I. Urban A. Ma X. Yu Y.T. Motorin Y. Branlant C. RNA. 2003; 9: 1371-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 26Jiang H.Q. Motorin Y. Jin Y.X. Grosjean H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2694-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cloning, Expression, and Purification of the Recombinant His6-Pus7p—Preparation of the pET28-PUS7 plasmid used for expression of the recombinant S. cerevisiae Pus7p was described previously (5Behm-Ansmant I. Urban A. Ma X. Yu Y.T. Motorin Y. Branlant C. RNA. 2003; 9: 1371-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). N-terminally His6-tagged Pus7p protein was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene). The transformed cells were grown for 5 h in autoinduction ZYM-5052 medium (27Studier F.W. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar) at 37 °C followed by 20 h at 20 °C. Cells where then harvested and disrupted in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl) by a 2 × 2-min sonication at 4 °C using a Branson-250 sonicator (50% duty cycle, Output 6). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation (20,000 × g for 30 min) and was directly applied to a column of nickel-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) charged with Ni2+. The column was first washed with buffer A and then 50 mm imidazole in Buffer A, and the protein was eluted using 500 mm imidazole in the same buffer. Fractions containing the Pus7p were pooled, concentrated to 10 mg/ml in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl using a Vivaspin YM-30 (Vivascience, France) concentration cell, and stored at -80 °C in 50% glycerol. In Vitro Activity Tests Using the Nearest Neighbor Approach—The enzymatic activity of the recombinant Pus7p was assayed in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm ammonium acetate, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA. All RNA substrates, diluted in 9 μl of the reaction buffer, were renatured by incubation for 5 min at 80 °C, followed by a 20-min incubation at room temperature. Two different ratios of [Pus7p]/[RNA] were used. In the first series of tests (excess of Pus7p), we used only 32P-labeled RNA substrate (1 nm final concentration), and in the second series of tests (excess of RNA) we used the same amount of 32P-labeled RNA but complemented by 10 pmol of nonradiolabeled RNA transcript (final concentration of 1 μm). The reaction was initiated by the addition of purified Pus7p diluted in the reaction buffer: 1 μm (conditions of Pus7p excess) or 10 nm (excess of RNA substrate). After 90 min of incubation at 30 °C, the modified RNAs were phenol-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and digested overnight by RNase T2 (0.01 units/μl) in 50 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 4.6. The resulting 3′-nucleotide monophosphates were fractionated by two-dimensional chromatography on thin layer cellulose plates (Polygram CEL 400; Macherey-Nagel, Germany). An isobutyric acid, 25% ammonia, water (66:1:33, v/v/v) mixture was used for the first dimension, whereas the second dimension was done in 2-propanol, 37% HCl, water (68:17.6:14.4, v/v/v). Assignment of nucleotides was based on previously published maps (28Keith G. Biochimie (Paris). 1995; 77: 142-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Radioactive spots were quantified on a PhosphorImager instrument (Typhoon 9410; Amersham Biosciences), using the Image-Quant software. Importance of the Conserved Sequence in RNA Substrates for Pus7p Activity in Vitro—The sequence alignment of the identified S. cerevisiae Pus7p substrates (Fig. 1B) revealed the strict conservation of a U residue at position -2 and an A residue at position +1 (as referred to the modified uridine). A G or a C residue is found at position -3, a purine residue at both positions -4 and +2, and a pyrimidine residue at position +3. In contrast, any nucleotide can be found at position -1, suggesting that the identity of this residue is not important for Pus7p activity. In order to test the influence of this conserved sequence on Pus7p activity, a set of tRNAAsp(GUC), pre-tRNATyr(GΨA), and 5′-terminal regions of U2 snRNA variants were produced. The 5′-terminal region of U2 snRNA (positions 1-139), which contains all the functional elements of U2 snRNA, was previously shown to be sufficient for Pus7p activity (4Ma X. Zhao X. Yu Y.T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1889-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Versions of these three RNAs with any nucleotide at positions -4, -3, -2, +1, and +2 were produced by in vitro transcription. Variant RNAs with a pyrimidine to purine substitution at position +3 were also generated. In addition, one variant with a base substitution at position -1 was used as a control. The recombinant Pus7p was produced as previously described (5Behm-Ansmant I. Urban A. Ma X. Yu Y.T. Motorin Y. Branlant C. RNA. 2003; 9: 1371-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and its activity on the variant and WT RNAs was tested both in the presence of a large excess of RNA substrate (1 μm of RNA for 10 nm of enzyme) and in conditions where the enzyme was in large excess (about 1 nm labeled RNA alone for 1 μm enzyme). The level of RNA modification by Pus7p was measured by the nearest neighbor approach after a long incubation period (90 min). This incubation time was selected based on the observation that complete modification of each of the WT RNAs was obtained after about 30 min of incubation under the same conditions. If some of the conserved residues in the RNA substrate were important for Pus7p activity, after their replacement, we expected to detect a decreased level of Ψ formation after 90 min of incubation. For each variant RNA, the identity of the [α-32P]NTP used for transcription was defined according to the identity of the residue at position +1as referred to the modified uridine. After incubation with the enzyme, the RNAs were digested with RNase T2, and the released 3′-phosphate mononucleotides were fractionated by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography. The yield of U to Ψ conversion was evaluated by measurement of the radioactivity in the fractionated 3′-phosphate mononucleotides, as previously described (5Behm-Ansmant I. Urban A. Ma X. Yu Y.T. Motorin Y. Branlant C. RNA. 2003; 9: 1371-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Quantification of the formed Ψ residue is less accurate for U2 snRNA as compared with tRNAAsp(GUC) and pre-tRNATyr(GΨA), because of its length and a high occurrence of UA dinucleotides in this RNA. To verify that the observed Ψ residue formed in the WT RNAs indeed corresponded to the expected position of U to Ψ conversions, control experiments were performed with variants bearing U to C substitution of the target U (U13C tRNAAsp(GUC), U35C pre-tRNATyr(GΨA), and U35C snRNA U2 5′-terminal region transcripts). As expected, no significant formation of Ψ residue was detected in these mutant RNAs after a 90-min incubation with Pus7p (see supplemental material). These results confirmed the strict specificity of Pus7p for a single position within all of these substrates; thus, we proceeded to definition of the identity elements required for this RNA recognition specificity. Residues at Positions-2 and +1 Play a Crucial Role for U to Ψ Conversion by Pus7p—In vitro modification of the WT and variants of tRNAAsp(GUC) and pre-tRNATyr(GΨA) by recombinant Pus7p was performed both in the excess of RNA substrate (Table 1) and enzyme (Pus7p) (Fig. 2). All tests were done in triplicate, and the mean values of the U to Ψ conversion level, together with the S.D. value, for each RNA substrate are given in Table 1 and in Fig. 2. The autoradiograms of the representative two-dimensional TLC obtained in one of these three series of experiments are shown as examples in Fig. S1. Under both experimental conditions, a major observation is that the yield of Ψ formation strongly depended on the position of the base substitution. Second, nearly identical results were obtained when using an excess of substrate or an excess of enzyme (Fig. 2). This might reflect the occurrence of structural heterogeneity of some of the variant RNAs, with only one part of the molecules being able to be modified. Since base substitutions in the tRNAAsp(GUC) were expected to alter the tRNA two-dimensional structure, we tested whether the presence of compensatory mutations at position 24 in the D-stem could compensate for the strong decrease of Ψ formation found for base substitutions at position 11 (position -2 in the conserved sequence). As shown in Table 1, restoration of a Watson-Crick base pair between nucleotides 11 and 24 in the D-stem did not increase the Pus7p activity. Therefore, modification of the sequence and not of RNA structure is responsible for the observed effect.TABLE 1Effect of mutations in tRNAAsp and pre-tRNATyr transcripts on their modification by recombinant Pus7p in catalytic reaction conditionsPositionΨquantificationtRNAAsp(GUC)pre-tRNATyr(GΨA)mol Ψ/mol tRNAmol Ψ/mol tRNAWT0.84 ± 0.03WT0.83 ± 0.02−4A9C0.74 ± 0.06A31C0.46 ± 0.03A9G0.65 ± 0.05A31G0.41 ± 0.03A9U0.70 ± 0.06A31U0.48 ± 0.02−3G10A0.56 ± 0.03C32A0.84 ± 0.04G10C0.71 ± 0.03C32G0.69 ± 0.02G10U0.64 ± 0.03C32U0.74 ± 0.03−2U11A0.01 ± 0.05U33A0.03 ± 0.01U11C0.04 ± 0.01U33C0.04 ± 0.01U11G0.02 ± 0.02U33G0.06 ± 0.01U11A/A24U0.02 ± 0.03U11C/A24G0.01 ± 0.02U11G/A24C0.01 ± 0.03−1U12C0.81 ± 0.03U34C0.81 ± 0.03ΨU13C0.00 ± 0.01U35C0.03 ± 0.01+1A14C0.05 ± 0.01A36C0.09 ± 0.05A14G0.05 ± 0.02A36G0.03 ± 0.01A14U0.02 ± 0.01A36U0.00 ± 0.01+2A15C0.24 ± 0.02A37C0.22 ± 0.01A15G0.38 ± 0.03A37G0.31 ± 0.02A15U0.46 ± 0.03A37U0.39 ± 0.02+3U16A0.79 ± 0.03U38A0.76 ± 0.02 Open table in a new tab The levels of Ψ formation in both tRNA transcripts bearing base substitutions at both positions -2 and +1 were nearly identical to those formed in control molecules (U13C substitution in tRNAAsp(GUC) and U35C substitution in the pre-tRNATyr(GΨA)). These data clearly indicated that base substitutions at positions -2 and +1 in both tRNAAsp(GUC) and pre-tRNATyr(GΨA) almost completely abolish U to Ψ conversion by yeast Pus7p. The same strong negative effect of base substitutions at positions -2 and +1 was also found in U2 snRNA (see supplemental material). Hence, interaction with residues U-2 and A+1 in any RNA substrate is probably required to achieve one of the steps in the overall Pus7p catalytic process. These data are in perfect agreement with the strict conservation of U-2 and A+1 in all natural RNAs modified by Pus7p in vivo (Fig. 1B) and with previous data obtained for modification of the A. thaliana pre-tRNATyr(GΨA) in a wheat germ extract (25Szweykowska-Kulinska Z. Beier H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1907-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Base substitutions at the four other positions, which are less strictly conserved (R-4, G/C-3, R+2, Y+3), had much less dramatic effects on the yield of U to Ψ conversion in all of the three substrates tested (Table 1 and Fig. S1, A-C). However, mutations at positions -3 and -4 had almost opposite effects in tRNAAsp(GUC) and pre-tRNATyr(GΨA). This may be linked to their respective RNA two-dimensional structures. Indeed, the base -3 in tRNAAsp(GUC) is base-paired with the nucleotide in the D-stem, whereas nucleotide -3 in the pre-tRNATyr(GΨA) is in the single-stranded region. On the other hand, position -4 in tRNAAsp(GUC) is not involved in the interaction with other nucleotides, whereas the base-pairing of the nucleotide at position -4 in the pre-tRNATyr(GΨA) is expected to stabilize the RNA two-dimensional structure (18Swerdlow H. Guthrie C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5197-5207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). In consequence, substitution of a nucleotide at position -3 in tRNAAsp(GUC) had a greater effect on Pus7p activity than substitution at position -4, whereas a more important effect is observed when the nucleotide at position -4 was mutated in the pre-tRNATyr(GΨA). Interestingly, substitution of residue A+2 had a marked negative effect in both the tRNAAsp(GUC) and pre-tRNATyr(GΨA). In addition, in both substrates, the A to U substitution had the lowest negative effect, whereas the A to C substitution had the greatest negative effect (Table 1 and Fig. 2). As expected, mutation at position -1, where any one of the four possible nucleotides may be found in Pus7p RNA substrates, had no effect on the yield of modification of both the tRNAAsp(GUC) and pre-tRNATyr(GΨA).

In the present study, we have analyzed the consequences and the potential molecular mechanisms involved in the ER retention of three Romano-Ward mutations located in KCNQ1 N terminus (Y111C, L114P, and P117L). We showed that the mutant KCNQ1 proteins exhibited reduced expression levels with respect to wild-type (WT)-KCNQ1. Radiolabeling pulse-chase experiments revealed that the lower expression levels did not result from reduced rate of synthesis. Instead, using a combination of Western blot and pulse-chase experiments, we showed that the mutant channel Y111C-KCNQ1, used as a model, was ubiquitinated and degraded in the proteasome more rapidly (t½ = 82 min) than WT-KCNQ1 channel (t½ = 113 min). On the other hand, KCNQ1 degradation did not appear to involve the GTP-dependent pathway. We also showed that KCNE1 stabilized both wild-type and Y111C proteins. To identify potential actors involved in KCNQ1 degradation, we studied the implication of the ER-resident protein Derlin-1 in KCNQ1 degradation. We showed that although KCNQ1 and Derlin-1 share the same molecular complex and co-immunoprecipitate when co-expressed in HEK293FT cells, Derlin-1 did not affect KCNQ1 steady state expression and degradation. These data were confirmed in T84 cells that express endogenous KCNQ1 and Derlin-1.

(Lond.). 2008; 586: 1785-1789Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). As a membrane protein, KCNQ1 is synthesized in the ER and is subjected to a stringent quality control to ensure that only fully functional channels reach the plasma membrane (11Anelli T. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 12Younger J.M. Chen L. Ren H. Rosser M.F.N. Turnbull E.L. Fan C. Patterson C. Cyr D.M.

If the folding process fails, the channel is retained in the ER and eventually degraded by the ER-associated degradation system. In this context, ER-resident molecular chaperones have the dual role to sense and assist the folding status of the proteins and to dispatch misfolded proteins for destruction. This conformation-sensing system also includes enzymes that tag the misfolded protein with ubiquitin to target them to the proteasome. Then, to reach the cytosolic proteasomal degradation machinery, the transmembrane protein must be retrotranslocated out of the ER phospholipid bilayer (14Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). The retrotranslocation occurs through an aqueous channel that is not yet clearly identified. Initial works suggested that the Sec61 translocon could constitute the pore (15Tsai B. Ye Y. Rapoport T.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar), but recent works highlighted the role of a macromolecular complex composed of VCP-interacting membrane protein (VIMP), p97, and Derlin-1 in this process (16Ye Y. Shibata Y. Yun C. Ron D. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 429: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar, 17Lilley B.N. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 2004; 429: 834-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Although many studies were dedicated to the analysis of channel protein trafficking defect and degradation, little is known about the KCNQ1 biosynthetic pathways. One important particularity of KCNQ1 is that it is part of a composite membrane protein complex formed by the association of four α-subunits and at least two single transmembrane domain ancillary β-subunits KCNE1 (18Morin T.J. Kobertz W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 1478-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Although it is recognized that both subunits associate in the ER and that KCNE1s strongly modify channel current kinetics (19Barhanin J. Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Nature. 1996; 384: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar), the role of KCNE1 in KCNQ1 biosynthesis and trafficking is less well understood. We recently identified a critical trafficking determinant of KCNQ1 in the N terminus of the protein, which is targeted by several mutations (8Dahiméne S. Alcoléa S. Naud P. Jourdon P. Escande D. Brasseur R. Thomas A. Baró I. Mérot J. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This region delineates a critical hotspot in the juxtamembranous domain just preceding its first transmembrane domain. Structure prediction analysis revealed that point mutations in this region could introduce potential folding defects and impair trafficking of the channel. We showed that the mutant channels remain trapped in the ER and can exert a dominant negative effect on WT channel subunits, most probably by sequestrating the latter in the ER (8Dahiméne S. Alcoléa S. Naud P. Jourdon P. Escande D. Brasseur R. Thomas A. Baró I. Mérot J. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We initiated the present study to analyze the fate of wild-type KCNQ1 protein along its biosynthetic pathway, the determine role of KCNE1 in this process, and to elucidate the potential mechanisms involved in the early ER retention and degradation of the newly synthesized mutant channels. cDNA Construct and siRNA—The human WT 6The KCNQ1 sequence is available at GenBank™ accession number NM_000218. and mutant Y111C, P117L, and L114P-KCNQ1 cDNAs were cloned in the pCB6 expression vector as described previously (8Dahiméne S.

KCNE1 7The KCNE1 sequence is available at GenBank accession number NM_000219. was cloned in pRc/CMV vector. C-terminally FLAG-tagged KCNE1 was a kind gift of Dr. AL George (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). Derlin-1 8The Derlin-1 sequence available at GenBank accession number NM_024295. cDNA, kindly provided by Dr. Hidde L. Ploegh (Whitehead Institute, Cambridge, MA), was cloned in pCB6 vector. According to Hegde et al. (20Hegde N.R. Chevalier M.S. Wisner T.W. Denton M.C. Shire K. Frappier L. Johnson D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20910-20919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the siRNA 5′-CGAUUUAAGGCCUGCUAUUtt-3′ targeting nucleotides 445-463 of Derlin-1 mRNA was a Silencer custom-made siRNA from Ambion (Cambridgeshire, UK). siRNA control was a Silencer negative control from Ambion. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney HEK293FT (HEK) (Invitrogen) and T84 cells (ATCC) were cultured in DMEM and Ham's F12/DMEM 1:1 (Invitrogen) respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. HEK cells were transiently transfected with 2 μg of total cDNA using FuGENE 6 from Roche Diagnostics following the manufacturer's instructions. In all the experiments, KCNQ1 cDNA was kept at 660 ng and transfected with equal amounts (660 ng) of KCNE1 and/or Derlin-1. CD4 cDNA was used as a ballast to keep total cDNA at 2 μg. Cells were used 24 h after transfection. T84 cells were transfected with the Amaxa cell line nucleofector kit from Amaxa Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD) following the manufacturer's instructions. 150 pmol of siRNA were used for 2.106 cells that were harvested 48 h after siRNA transfection. Antibodies (Ab) and Chemicals—Anti-Derlin-1 Ab was obtained from MBL International Corp. (PM018, Nagoya, Japan); anti-GAPDH Ab (SC-32233), anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase Ab (SC-2054), and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase Ab (SC-2055) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-KCNQ1 Ab was obtained from Alomone (APC-022, Jerusalem, Israel) or Santa Cruz Biotechnology (SC C-20); and anti-ubiquitin Ab was obtained from BIOMOL International L.P. (SK2, Plymouth Meeting, PA). All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, unless otherwise stated. MG132 proteasome inhibitor was from BIOMOL International and was used at 25 μm. Mycophenolic acid was from BIOMOL and was used at 2 or 40 μm. Dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP) was from Pierce. Immunoprecipitation (IP) and Western Blots—In IP experiments, HEK cells were lysed in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics); T84 cells were lysed in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture. Cell extracts were incubated 30 min at 4 °C under agitation. The cell lysates were centrifuged 15 min at 16 000 × g, and the supernatants were incubated with the appropriate antibody overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were isolated with protein G-Sepharose beads (HiTrap protein G HP from GE Healthcare, Chalfont St. Giles, UK), washed extensively with lysis buffer, denatured in Laemmli sample buffer for 10 min at 70 °C, separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes Hybond C-extra (GE Healthcare). The blots were probed with anti-KCNQ1 (1/4000 for transfected cells or 1/500 for T84), anti-Derlin-1 (1/1000), and anti-GAPDH (1/10 000) antibodies. When anti-ubiquitin Ab (1/500) was used, 2% bovine serum albumin was used to block nitrocellulose membrane instead of 5% fat-free milk. Horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies were used at 1/10 000. Films were scanned on ImageScanner™ densitometer (GE Healthcare), and the ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) was used for image quantification. Signals were normalized with respect to GAPDH and are expressed as a ratio of the control condition. To test KCNQ1 ubiquitination, HEK cells were incubated 4 h with 25 μm MG132 prior lysis, and 10 mm N-ethyl maleimide was added to the IP buffer. Protein concentrations in cell extracts were determined using the D/C assay kit from Bio-Rad. To co-immunoprecipitate KCNQ1 and chaperones, cells were treated with the cross-linker DSP (DSP) for 30 min and then with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, for 20 min and finally washed in phosphate-buffered saline prior to cell lysis. Pulse-Chase Assays and Half-life Estimation—24 h after transfection, transiently transfected HEK cells were starved in methionine and cysteine-free DMEM (Invitrogen) for 30 min and then metabolically labeled using Redivue Pro-mix [35S]Met/Cys (GE Healthcare) 0.5 mCi/ml for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, washed once with DMEM, and lysed immediately or incubated in complete DMEM for 1, 2, or 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were lysed, and KCNQ1 was immunoprecipitated and separated by SDS-PAGE as described above. Labeled KCNQ1 was revealed by autoradiography on a Typhoon 9410™ scanner (GE Healthcare). The ImageQuant™ software (GE Healthcare) was used for analysis. When used, MG132 (25 μm) and mycophenolic acid (2 or 40 μm) were added just after the 15-min pulse period. To calculate KCNQ1 half-life time, signals at times t (Xt) were normalized with respect to the signal at t = 0 (X0) and plotted according to ln(Xt/X0) = bt. The half-life time (t½) was calculated as t½ = ln(0,5)/b were b is the slope of the regression curve. Statistics—All experiments were carried out at least three times. All data are presented as means ± S.E., and n indicates the number of experiments. Means were compared with a Student's t test. Decrease curves were compared with a parallelism test. A p value inferior to 0.05 was considered statistically significant and is reported. The 95% interval of confidence (CI95) mentioned in parentheses and separated by semicolons (x;x). N-terminal KCNQ1 Mutants Exhibit Lower Expression Levels than WT-KCNQ1—In a previous study, we have shown that Romano Ward mutations located in KCNQ1 N terminus determined ER retention of the mutant channel proteins (8Dahiméne S. Alcoléa S. Naud P. Jourdon P. Escande D. Brasseur R. Thomas A. Baró I. Mérot J. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the present study, we analyzed the mechanisms and the consequences of this ER retention. First, we asked whether WT-KCNQ1 and mutant KCNQ1 exhibited different expression levels. To answer this question, we transiently expressed WT-, Y111C-, L114P-, and P117L-KCNQ1 in HEK cells and quantified channel expression by Western blotting. As illustrated on Fig. 1, A and B, all the mutated proteins were expressed at lower levels than WT-KCNQ1. Also, P117L mutant steady state expression was higher than Y111C and L114P. To ascertain that these differences did not result from undesired mutations in plasmid sequences and/or the quality of DNA preparations, they were entirely sequenced, and the experiments were repeated with three different plasmid preparations. No difference was observed, and the data were pooled in Fig. 1. N-terminal KCNQ1 Mutations Do Not Impair Channel Synthesis—The steady state differences we observed could be explained either by different synthesis or by different degradation rates. To test these hypotheses, we analyzed channel synthesis in details. HEK cells transiently transfected with WT or mutants KCNQ1 and KCNE1 cDNAs were pulsed-labeled 15 min with 35S-radiolabeled methionine and cysteine. The KCNQ1 proteins newly synthesized during the pulse were then immunoprecipitated and quantified. As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, no significant difference (analysis of variance p = 0.3) was observed between WT-KCNQ1 and any of the mutant channels demonstrating equivalent neo-synthesis rates. Taken together, reduced steady state expression levels of the mutants and their similar synthesis rates when compared with WT-KCNQ1 suggested that both WT and mutant proteins followed different degradation kinetics. KCNQ1 Degradation Is Mediated by the Proteasome—In the following experiments, we analyzed KCNQ1 degradation by the proteasome pathway. We used Y111C-KCNQ1 as a model of KCNQ1 mutant and compared its degradation kinetics with those of WT-KCNQ1. Because ubiquitination is a prerequisite to proteasomal targeting, we first analyzed KCNQ1 ubiquitination. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, both immunoprecipitated WT-KCNQ1 and Y111C-KCNQ1 were labeled by anti-ubiquitin antibodies, and labeling increased when the cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (25 μm for 4 h). Effective proteasomal degradation of KCNQ1 was demonstrated in pulse-chase experiments in the presence of MG132 (Fig. 2, B and C). Indeed, in cells pulse-labeled for 15 min, only 27% ± 4 (n = 8) of the newly synthesized KCNQ1 remained after a 4-h chase period in the absence of proteasome inhibitor, whereas 84% ± 8 (n = 4) remained after 4 h in the presence of MG132 (25 μm). Y111C mutant degradation was also reduced by the proteasome inhibitor. 16% ± 4 (n = 8) and 54% ± 4 (n = 3) of Y111C remained after the chase period in the absence and the presence of MG132, respectively. Because MG132 efficiency seemed lower for Y111C, we asked whether Y111C could be degraded through alternative lysosomal or GTP-dependent pathways as described recently for CFTR (21De Keukeleire B. Micoud J. Biard J. Benharouga M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2008; 40: 1729-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). To answer this question, HEK transfected with Y111C were pulsed and then chased for 4 h in the presence of the lysosomal or the GTP-dependent degradation pathway inhibitors, chloroquine (100 μm) and mycophenolic acid (2 μm and 40 μm), respectively. None of the inhibitors affected Y111C degradation (data not shown), indicating that lysosomal and GTP-dependent pathways do not play an important role in the degradation of newly synthesized mutant channel. Taken together, these experiments led us to conclude that newly synthesized WT- and Y111C-KCNQ1 degradation was mainly achieved by the proteasome. Mutant KCNQ1 Are Less Stable than WT Channel Protein—We then compared the degradation kinetics of mutant and WT-KCNQ1. Cells were pulse-labeled 15 min, and newly synthesized KCNQ1 proteins remaining after 1, 2, and 4 h of chase were immunoprecipitated and quantified. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, the Y111C mutant was degraded more rapidly than the WT channel. The mean half-life of Y111C (82 min) was significantly shorter (p = 0.0008, n = 5) than that of WT-KCNQ1 (113 min). Derlin-1 Associates with KCNQ1 in HEK Cells—To characterize the mechanisms involved in KCNQ1 control quality and the ER-associated degradation system, we have analyzed the role of the ER-resident protein Derlin-1 that has been implicated in the retrotranslocation from the ER to the cytosol of CFTR (22Sun F. Zhang R. Gong X. Geng X. Drain P. Frizzell R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36856-36863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and KCa2.3 and KCa3.1 (23Gao Y. Chotoo C.K. Balut C.M. Sun F. Bailey M.A. Devor D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9049-9059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) channels. We first analyzed whether KCNQ1 and Derlin-1 are part of the same molecular complex. HEK cells were transiently transfected with WT- or Y111C-KCNQ1, KCNE1, and Derlin-1, and KCNQ1 was immunoprecipitated. As shown in Fig. 4A, Derlin-1 was efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with both WT-KCNQ1 and Y111C-KCNQ1. We then analyzed whether this association had any functional effect on KCNQ1 expression. Contrarily to what has been described for CFTR and KCa(s), Derlin-1 overexpression did not significantly modify WT- and Y111C-KCNQ1 steady state expression levels (Fig. 4, B and C) or the degradation kinetics of the newly synthesized proteins (Fig. 4, D and E). To ensure that these contradictory observations did not result from the overwhelming of the biosynthetic and/or degradation pathways in the in vitro expression systems used here, a new series of experiments was conducted in T84 cells that endogenously express both KCNQ1 and Derlin-1. As illustrated in Fig. 5, endogenous Derlin-1 did not co-immunoprecipitate with either endogenous KCNQ1 (Fig. 5A) or overexpressed WT- or Y111C-KCNQ1 (Fig. 5B). Tunicamycin, used to induce ER stress and to favor Derlin-1 association with its substrates, as shown previously for CFTR and p97 (24Goldstein R.F. Niraj A. Sanderson T.P. Wilson L.S. Rab A. Kim H. Bebok Z. Collawn J.F. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2007; 36: 706-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), did not increase Derlin-1 interaction with KCNQ1 either (data not shown). Moreover, decreasing Derlin-1 expression using specific siRNA did not increase KCNQ1 steady state expression either (Fig. 5, C and D). Together our data indicate that Derlin-1 is not functionally involved in KCNQ1 retrotranslocation.FIGURE 5Endogenous Derlin-1 and KCNQ1 do not co-immunoprecipitate in T84 cells.

T84 cells were transfected with siRNA targeting Derlin-1 or control siRNA. 48 h after transfection, Derlin-1 and KCNQ1 expression levels were estimated by Western blot. GAPDH was used to normalize signals. D, quantification of KCNQ1 and Derlin-1 expression. The values are expressed as a percentage of the signals measured in the presence of the control siRNA.

Cui L. Hou Y. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6879-6887Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 26Ficker E. Dennis A.T. Wang L. Brown A.M. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: e87-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We thus tested the interaction of WT and mutant KCNQ1 with a panel of ER-resident chaperones, namely Hsp70, Hsp90, protein disulfide isomerase (Fig. 6A, PDI), BiP, calnexin, and ERp72. As illustrated on Fig. 6A, only Hsp70 was co-immunoprecipitated with WT and Y111C mutant in the presence of the cross-linking agent DSP. Although it is recognized that KCNE1 and KCNQ1 associate in the ER and that KCNE1 strongly modifies channel current kinetics (19Barhanin J. Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Nature. 1996; 384: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar), the role of KCNE1 in KCNQ1 biosynthesis has, to our knowledge, never been directly analyzed. First we ascertained that, in our conditions, KCNE1 interacted with both WT-KCNQ1 and Y111C-KCNQ1. As shown in Fig. 6B, KCNE1 was readily co-immunoprecipitated with WT- and Y111C-KCNQ1. We then analyzed its functional effect on channel biosynthesis in pulse-chase experiments. As illustrated on Fig. 6, C and D, KCNE1 increased WT channel half-life from 77 min (CI95: (63;99)) (without KCNE1) to 113 min (CI95: (95;140)). KCNE1 also had an effect on Y111C mutant, increasing the t½ from 59 min (CI95: (53;66)) to 82 min (CI95: (70;99)). Together these data show that KCNE1 is able to interact with both WT-KCNQ1 and mutant Y111C-KCNQ1 and exerts a chaperone effect to stabilize newly synthesized channels. In the present study, we have analyzed the biosynthesis pathways of the WT- and LQT1-associated KCNQ1 channel mutants. To our knowledge, our data represent the first study of KCNQ1 channel processing in the early secretory pathway. In the heart, KCNQ1 subunits associate with the ancillary subunits KCNE1 to carry the slow component of the delayed rectifier potassium current (IKs) (19Barhanin J. Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Nature. 1996; 384: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we showed that LQT1-associated mutations located in the N terminus of the protein may introduce sufficient protein structure alterations to determine the ER retention of the mutant channels (8Dahiméne S. Alcoléa S. Naud P. Jourdon P. Escande D. Brasseur R. Thomas A. Baró I. Mérot J. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The lower steady state expression levels of mutant KCNQ1 channels, which we observed with respect to WT protein, prompted us to analyze the fate of newly synthesized channels. As expected, in the in vitro re-expression system, we did not detect significant differences between the synthesis rates of the different constructs. Moreover, preliminary co-immunoprecipitation, fractionation, and solubilization studies did not reveal differential aggregation properties between WT and any of the mutants (data not shown), suggesting that they shared the same pathways and cellular compartments. Indeed, as with all the membrane proteins, KCNQ1 undergoes a strict quality control in the ER. In this compartment, molecular chaperones scrutinize the structure of nascent proteins and help them to acquire a native conformation and serve to dispose of those that do not have a proper one (11Anelli T. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). We tested a panel of cytosolic and ER chaperones including Hsp70, Hsp90, BiP, calnexin, and calreticulin for their interactions with WT- and Y111C-KCNQ1. Neither lectin chaperone, calnexin nor calreticulin, was found to bind the channel. Although this is consistent with the absence of core glycosylation in KCNQ1, more surprisingly, interaction was not detected in the presence of glycosylated KCNE1 despite the fact that KCNE1 was efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with KCNQ1. On the other hand, Hsp70 was found to physically interact with both mutant and WT-KCNQ1. Our observation is consistent with previous studies showing that Hsp70 interacts with a subset of proteins that are believed to have difficulties to reach their final conformation (27Nathan D.F. Vos M.H. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12949-12956Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Indeed, as far as ionic channel channels are concerned, Hsp70 was shown to bind Herg channel (26Ficker E. Dennis A.T. Wang L. Brown A.M. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: e87-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and CFTR (25Loo M.A. Jensen T.J. Cui L. Hou Y. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6879-6887Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). However, one should note that, in contrast to Herg, Hsp70-KCNQ1 interaction was only detected in the presence of the cross-linking agent DSP, suggesting that the interaction was transient and weak. This is consistent with the lack of effect of Hsp70 overexpression or knockdown (using siRNA) on KCNQ1 expression level (data not shown). Among other potential KCNQ1 molecular chaperones, we analyzed the role of the ancillary subunit KCNE1 in the fate of the channel complex. Using pulse-chase experiments, we showed that KCNE1 increased the stability of both WT-KCNQ1 and mutant KCNQ1 (Fig. 6). These results further sustain the idea that KCNE1 and KCNQ1 associate early in the secretory pathways during channel biogenesis and assign a new role to KCNE1 in the macromolecular KCNQ1 channel complex. Indeed, previous studies clearly showed that KCNE1 increased KCNQ1 current and modified the electrophysiological properties of the KCNQ1 channel (half-activation potential and kinetics of inactivation) (19Barhanin J. Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Nature. 1996; 384: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar, 28Wu D. Lai L. Zhang M. Wang H. Jiang M. Liu X. Tseng G.

In addition, although more contradictory, previous studies also reported increased trafficking of KCNQ1 when co-expressed with KCNE1 (31Krumerman A. Gao X. Bian J. Melman Y.F. Kagan A. McDonald T.V.

Finally, the chaperone role that we propose for KCNE1 is consistent with previous publications showing that β-subunits stabilize and enhance the trafficking of other channels (32Rusconi R. Scalmani P. Cassulini R.R. Giunti G. Gambardella A. Franceschetti S. Annesi G. Wanke E. Mantegazza M. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 11037-11046Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 33Kunjilwar K. Strang C. DeRubeis D. Pfaffinger P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54542-54551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Together our data assign a new role to the KCNE1 subunit in channel stability and biogenesis. Most probably, other molecular chaperones assist KCNQ1 channel folding and will be unveiled in future investigations. We showed that WT and mutant KCNQ1 are ubiquitinated. Furthermore, when MG132 was added during pulse-chase experiments, the KCNQ1 remaining after 4 h of chase was increased. These results are consistent with the notion that KCNQ1 degradation is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In our experiments, 84 and 54% of WT- and Y111C-KCNQ1 remain in the presence of the MG132, respectively. The strong effect on WT channel is in agreement with the 80% reduction of the proteasome activity reported by Zafar et al. (34Zafar K.S. Inayat-Hussain S.H. Ross D. J. Neurochem. 2007; 102: 913-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Whether part of the Y111C mutant follows an additional degradation pathway remains to be determined. In any case, lysosomal or GTP-dependent degradation pathways do not seem to be involved in this process as either chloroquine or mycophenolic acid affected Y111C degradation (21De Keukeleire B. Micoud J. Biard J. Benharouga M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2008; 40: 1729-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 35Jansen J.A. de Boer T.P. Wolswinkel R. van Veen T.A.B.

To be degraded in the proteasome, membrane proteins must be retrotranslocated toward the cytoplasm (14Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). Recently, the ER-resident Derlin-1, in association with Vimp1 and p97 (16Ye Y. Shibata Y. Yun C. Ron D. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 429: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar), was shown to promote the degradation of CFTR (22Sun F. Zhang R. Gong X. Geng X. Drain P. Frizzell R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36856-36863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), KCa3.1, KCa2.3 (23Gao Y. Chotoo C.K. Balut C.M. Sun F. Bailey M.A. Devor D.C. J. Biol.

Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 429: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar, 17Lilley B.N. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 2004; 429: 834-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). We thus questioned whether Derlin-1 was also implicated in KCNQ1 retrotranslocation. Our results show that Derlin-1 has no essential role in KCNQ1 degradation. Whatever the amount of WT- and Y111C-KCNQ1 plasmid cDNA we used to limit channel expression and avoid overwhelming of degradation pathways, and despite the fact that overexpressed proteins could be co-immunoprecipitated, we could not detect any effect of Derlin-1 on channel steady state expression level or degradation. These data were confirmed in T84 cells that endogenously express both KCNQ1 and Derlin-1. Indeed, siRNA knock-down of Derlin-1 had no effect on KCNQ1 expression level in T84 cells. Whether other pathways are involved in KCNQ1 retrotranslocation remains to be determined. We suspect that the two additional Derlins (Derlin-2 and Derlin-3) described in mammalians are not involved in this process (36Lilley B.N. Gilbert J.M. Ploegh H.L. Benjamin T.L. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 8739-8744Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 37Oda Y. Okada T. Yoshida H. Kaufman R.J. Nagata K. Mori K. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Indeed, Derlin-2 seems to be restricted to the retrotranslocation of luminal ER substrates, whereas Derlin-3 facilitates the disposal of misfolded glycosylated substrates (36Lilley B.N. Gilbert J.M. Ploegh H.L. Benjamin T.L. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 8739-8744Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 37Oda Y. Okada T. Yoshida H. Kaufman R.J. Nagata K. Mori K. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the Derlin-1-independent and ubiquitin- and proteasome-dependent HIP pathway (for Hrd-independent proteolysis) described in yeast by Haynes et al. (38Haynes C.M. Caldwell S. Cooper A.A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) may be a good candidate for KCNQ1 retrotranslocation and degradation. This alternative pathway will have to be tested in future studies. In conclusion, we have shown that LQT1-associated mutations determine increased degradation of the mutant proteins by the proteasome and that the ancillary subunit KCNE1 participates to the stability and the biogenesis of KCNQ1 channel complex.

It is expressed by almost all pathogenic pneumococci and has been shown to increase the virulence of a pneumococcal strain by more than a million-fold in an animal model system (1Avery O.T. Dubos R. J. Exp. Med. 1931; 54: 73-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The capsule shields pneumococci from the host phagocytes, and its shielding capacity can be neutralized when the host produces antibodies to the capsule and to fix complement on pneumococci. Thus, the capsular PS is used as the antigen in all pneumococcal vaccines that are clinically used. Because of their impact on human health, pneumococcal capsules have been extensively investigated both serologically, genetically, and biochemically. Many years of serological studies have identified 91 serologically distinct capsule types (2Henrichsen J. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1995; 33: 2759-2762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Park I.H. Pritchard D.G. Cartee R. Brandao A. Brandileone M.C.C. Nahm M.H. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2007; 45: 1225-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Recently, the nucleotide sequences of the capsule gene loci of all 91 different capsule types have been determined (4Bentley S.D. Aanensen D.M. Mavroidi A. Saunders D. Rabbinowitsch E. Collins M. Donohoe K. Harris D. Murphy L. Quail M.A. Samuel G. Skovsted I.C. Kaltoft M.S. Barrell B. Reeves P.R. Parkhill J. Spratt B.G.

With the use of monoclonal antibodies, serologic heterogeneity was noted recently among pneumococcal isolates that were typed as 11A using the quellung reaction (6Yu J. Carvalho M. Beall B. Nahm M.H. J. Med. Microbiol. 2008; 57: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To avoid confusion, we have provisionally named the common variant 11Aα and the less common variant 11Aβ. Because 11A PS is a component of the 23-valent pneumococcal PS vaccine (7Abeygunawardana C. Williams T.C. Sumner J.S. Hennessey J.P. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 226-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), it is important to understand the chemical basis of the serological heterogeneity among pneumococci that are typed as serotype 11A. However, there is only limited information on structure of pneumococcal serotype 11A PS, and the structure has not been examined with modern tools. Forty years ago, the structural model for S. pneumoniae serotype 11A PS was proposed to be a linear polymer containing d-glucose, d-galactose, glycerol, phosphate, and O-acetyl groups in the molar ratio of 2:2:1:1:2 based upon analysis of chemically modified PS (8Kennedy D.A. Buchanan J.G. Baddiley J. Biochem. J. 1969; 115: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). About 20 years ago, Richards et al. (9Richards J.C. Perry M.B. Kniskern P.J. Can. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1985; 63: 953-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 10Richards J.C. Perry M.B. Moreau M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1988; 228: 595-596Crossref Google Scholar) proposed the model for 11A PS based on both NMR and chemical degradation studies. They proposed a linear repeating unit structure with four monosaccharides, a pendant glycerol phosphate moiety, and 2 mol of acetate as described in Structure 1, To explain the serological heterogeneity among the pneumococcal isolates expressing 11A serotype, we investigated the 11A PS structure using three preparations of capsular PS (11A PS commercially available from ATCC, 11Aα PS purified from an 11Aα strain of pneumococcus, and 11Aβ PS purified from an 11Aβ strain) and modern NMR equipment and methods. Modern NMR equipment, such as cryogenically cooled probes (11Kotsubo V. Nast R. Adv. Cryo. Eng. 1995; 41: 1857-1864Crossref Google Scholar), allows the acquisition of heteronuclear data on samples of PSs using 13C at natural abundance at reasonable concentrations (5 mg/ml PS) in a reasonable amount of time (∼6 h for an 1H-13C HSQC). Modern pulse sequences such as HSQC-TOCSY and HMBC are also extremely useful for the assignment of the HSQC spectrum as these experiments correlate heteronuclear spins in a given residue (HSQC-TOCSY and HMBC) or across glycosidic linkages (HMBC). Preparation of Capsular PS-Purified 11A PS was purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). 11Aα and 11Aβ PSs were purified as described below from pneumococcal strains 3054-06 and 3455-06, which express serotypes 11Aα and 11Aβ, respectively (6Yu J. Carvalho M. Beall B. Nahm M.H. J. Med. Microbiol. 2008; 57: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Pneumococci were grown overnight at 37 °C in 4 liters of a chemically defined medium (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) (12Vanderijn I. Kessler R.E. Infect. Immun. 1980; 27: 444-448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with choline chloride (1 g/liter), sodium bicarbonate (2.5 g/liter), and cysteine-HCl (0.73 g/liter). Pneumococcal lysate was obtained by adding deoxycholate (0.05%) to the medium and removing the cell debris by centrifugation. Crude PS was obtained from the lysate by selective ethanol precipitation, i.e. discarding the material precipitating at 50% ethanol and harvesting the material precipitating at 70% ethanol. The crude PS was dissolved in 120 ml of 0.2 m NaCl and dialyzed in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The crude PS was then loaded onto a column (10 × 2.5 cm) containing DEAE-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and PS was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 2 m. The resulting fractions were tested for the presence of 11Aα or 11Aβ PS with the inhibition assay described below. The PS-containing fractions were pooled, dialyzed, and lyophilized. The lyophilized PS was dissolved in water (10 mg/ml), and 20-30 mg of PS was loaded onto a Sephacryl S-300 HR (Amersham Biosciences) column (100 × 1.5 cm). PS was eluted from the column with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) buffer containing 100 mm NaCl. All the fractions were again tested for 11Aα or 11Aβ PS with the inhibition assay. 11Aα or 11Aβ PS that eluted early from the column were pooled and lyophilized. De-O-acetylation was performed using alkali hydrolysis as described (13McNeely T.B. Staub J.M. Rusk C.M. Blum M.J. Donnelly J.J. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 3705-3710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition Assay for 11Aα and 11Aβ PS-The assay for the capsular PS is an inhibition-type enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay described previously (6Yu J. Carvalho M. Beall B. Nahm M.H. J. Med. Microbiol. 2008; 57: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, the wells of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates (Corning Costar Corp., Acton, MA) were coated at 37 °C with 1 μg/ml PS solution for 5 h in phosphate-buffered saline. 11A PS was used for 11Aα assay, and 11Aβ PS purified as below was used for 11Aβ assay. After washing the plates with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, an appropriately diluted sample was added to the well along with a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibody Hyp11AM2 was used for 11Aα assay, and monoclonal antibody Hyp11AM1 was used for 11Aβ assay. After 60 min of incubation in a humid incubator at 37 °C, the plates were washed and incubated for 1 h with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Sigma). The amount of the enzyme immobilized to the wells was determined with para-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate (Sigma) in diethanolamine buffer. The absorbance at 405 nm was read with a microplate reader (BioTek Instruments Inc, Winooski, VT). NMR Spectroscopy-NMR data were acquired at 322 K (7Abeygunawardana C. Williams T.C. Sumner J.S. Hennessey J.P. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 226-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) on a Varian Inova 600-MHz spectrometer equipped with a cryogenically cooled HCN probe. All data were base-line corrected using a 3rd order Bernstein polynomial fit algorithm. A one-dimensional 1H proton spectrum with presaturation of the water resonance was acquired with 16 transients, a spectral width of 5997 Hz and 8192 points. Spectrum was transformed without apodization. Two-dimensional 1H-1H TOCSY (150- and 60-ms mix time) was acquired with 16 and 32 transients, respectively, spectral widths of 6000.6 Hz, and 4096 points in F2 and 5994.6 Hz and 512 point in F1. Apodization prior to Fourier transform was performed using a 90°-shifted sinebell in F2 and 90°-shifted sinebell squared in F1. Two-dimensional 1H-1H nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (400-ms mix time) was acquired with 16 and 32 transients, respectively, spectral widths of 6000.6 Hz, and 8192 points in F2 and 5994.6 Hz and 512 points in F1. Apodization prior to Fourier transform was performed using a 90°-shifted sinebell in F2 and 90°-shifted sinebell squared in F1. Two-dimensional 1H-1H gradient-selected COSY was acquired with 16 transients, spectral widths of 6000.6 Hz in both F2 and F1, and 4096 and 256 points in F2 and F1, respectively. Apodization prior to Fourier transform was performed with 1°-shifted sinebell in both dimensions. Two-dimensional 1H-13C gradient-selected HSQC (with and without multiplicity editing) was acquired with 32 transients, spectral widths of 6000.6 Hz in F2 and 33167.5 Hz in F1, and 1024 and 256 points in F2 and F1, respectively. Two-dimensional 1H-13C HSQC-TOCSY was acquired with 128 transients, spectral widths of 6000.6 Hz in F2 and 30143.2 Hz in F1, with 1024 points and 256 points in F2 and F1, respectively, and 15-, 35-, 50-, and 75-ms mix times,. Two-dimensional 1H-13C HMBC was acquired with 128 transients, spectral widths of 6000.6 Hz in F2 and 33167.5 Hz in F1, with 1024 points and 512 points in F2 and F1, respectively, and 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 20 Hz multiple bond coupling and 140 Hz 1JCH coupling. Apodization prior to Fourier transform was performed using a 90°-shifted sinebell in F2 and 90°-shifted sinebell squared in F1. 1H-31P HMBC spectra were acquired on a 500-MHz Varian spectrometer equipped with a pentaprobe with 64 transients, spectral widths of 4497.7 Hz in F2, and 4040 Hz in F1, with 1024 points and 256 points in F2 and F1, respectively, and 29.79 Hz multiple bond coupling and 5 Hz 1JHP coupling. Minimal apodization prior to Fourier transform was performed using a 1°-shifted sinebell in F2 and 1°-shifted sinebell squared in F1. Chemical shifts were referenced relative to DSS or DMSO-d6 (0.00 ppm for 1H and 13C for DSS or 2.712 ppm δH and 39.56 ppm δC for DMSO). 31P chemical shifts were referenced indirectly to the proton frequency. Data processing was performed using Mestrenova. 1H and 13C Chemical Shift Assignment of the De-O-acetylated 11A PS-To investigate the 11A PS structure, we first obtained 1H spectra of the de-O-acetylated and native 11A PSs. As expected, de-O-acetylation reduced spectral complexity, and therefore the spectrum of de-O-acetylated PS was analyzed first. Although there appeared to be only two anomeric peaks (at 5.17 and 4.97 ppm), this was due to obscuring of two additional peaks (4.54 and 4.51 ppm) by residual water. The two obscured peaks were clearly observed in the 1H-13C HSQC spectrum (Fig. 1, black), which clearly showed all four anomeric peaks (black arrows). The presence of these four peaks indicates that the repeat unit is composed of four residues, two each in the α (1JCH = 176 and 175 Hz) and β configuration (1JCH = 166 and 163 Hz). The four anomeric peaks were termed α1 (5.17 ppm), α2 (4.97 ppm), β1 (4.54 ppm), and β2 (4.51 ppm) based upon their H-1 chemical shifts. Based upon previous work, these four peaks should correspond to two d-glucose and two d-galactose residues, one each of the α and β isomers. All further assignments began with the chemical shifts of the anomeric resonances. In the 2.4-0.5 ppm region of the NMR spectrum, no significant peaks were observed suggesting that the de-O-acetylated core is fully de-O-acetylated and contains no hexoses with methyl groups (e.g. rhamnose). In this region, minor peaks were observed, and these minor peaks arose from contaminating C-PS (teichoic acid). Based upon the intensity of the peak arising from the N-methylphosphocholine of C-PS (10Richards J.C. Perry M.B. Moreau M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1988; 228: 595-596Crossref Google Scholar) at 3.22 ppm, the de-O-acetylated 11A PS contains 1.6 mol % C-PS, whereas the native sample contains 1.3 mol % C-PS (14Xu Q.W. Abeygunawardana C. Ng A.S. Sturgess A.W. Harmon B.J. Hennessey J.P. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 336: 262-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This degree of contaminants is consistent with previous findings (14Xu Q.W. Abeygunawardana C. Ng A.S. Sturgess A.W. Harmon B.J. Hennessey J.P. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 336: 262-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Each peak in the 1H-13C HSQC spectrum of the core 11A PS (Fig. 1, black) was identified based upon the combination of data from the following experiments: 1H-1H TOCSY (75 ms and 150 isotropic mix time), 1H-1H gradient-selected COSY, 1H-1H nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (50-, 100-, and 250-ms mix time), 1H-13C gradient-selected HSQC with adiabatic decoupling, and 1H-13C gradient-selected HSQC with multiplicity editing, 1H-13C HMBC (140 Hz 1JCH, 8 and 12 Hz multiple-bond coupling), and 1H-13C gradient-selected HSQC-TOCSY (140 1JCH and 35-ms mix time with direct correlations inverted). Briefly, TOCSY and COSY spectra were used to create spin systems arising from each anomeric proton. The HSQC-TOCSY and HSQC was used to assign 13C chemical shift(s) to each 1H resonance. The HMBC spectra were used to generate anomeric (inter-residue) connectivities as well as connectivities for other resonances (intra-residue). Long range COSY peaks were used to confirm the connectivities identified by the HMBC experiment (15Otter A. Bundle D.R. J. Magn. Res. 1995; 109: 194-201Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Each set of assignments was performed independently twice. The assignments of the 1H-13C HSQC spectrum of the core 11A PS is summarized in Table 1. The d-galactose and d-glucose residues could be differentiated based upon the chemical shift of the H-2 (3.93 versus 3.64 for the α-anomers and 3.67 versus 3.39 for the β-anomers). This leads to the assignment of α1 and β2 as d-galactose and α2 and β1 as d-glucose. Additionally, galactose can be differentiated from glucose by the weak coupling of the H-4 (16Duus J.O. Gotfredsen C.H. Bock K. Chem. Rev. 2000; 100: 4589-4614Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The 1H-1H TOCSY for α1 and β2 showed weak coupling from H-4 to H-5, whereas that for α2 and β1 showed strong coupling for H-4 to H-5. This supports the assignment of α1 and β2 as α-d-galactose and β-d-galactose and α2 and β1 as α-d-glucose and β-d-glucose. The assignment of the remaining resonances proceeds from these assignments directly.TABLE 1Chemical shift assignment of de-O-acetylated 11A PSResidue1234566′αGal (α1)5.17aChemical shifts (1H/13C[31P]) are in ppm and are referenced to DSS-d6 and DMSO-d6.

Open table in a new tab Determination of the Inter-residue Linkages in De-O-acetylated 11A PS-The glycosidic linkages can be unambiguously identified from the anomeric region of the HMBC spectrum acquired with 8 Hz multiple bond coupling (Fig. 2). This region shows the H-C-O-C connectivities arising from the anomeric protons that are essential to the proper arrangement of the residues in the primary sequence. The following inter-residue connectivities were observed: [-α-d-Gal(1→3)β-d-Gal-], [-α-d-Glc(1→4)α-d-Gal-], [-β-d-Glc(1→6)α-d-Gal-], and [-β-d-Gal(1→4)β-d-Glc-]. This finding showed that the α-d-;Galactose (α1) residue is linked at H-1, H-4, and H-6. The glycosidic linkage assignments were unambiguous for several reasons. First, connectivities were observed both from the anomeric proton to the connecting carbons and to the anomeric carbons from the connecting proton, ensuring the correctness of these assignments. Second, there was absolutely no ambiguity in linking the 13C shifts of the residue. The multiplicity-edited 1H-13C HSQC was crucial to determination of the [-β-d-Glc(1→6)α-d-Gal-] linkage because of the unusual 13C chemical shift of the α-d-Gal H-6 (because of its substitution) and the overlap of the α-d-Gal H-6 in the 1H dimension. Finally, long range COSY cross-peaks were observed for α-d-galactose H-1/β-d-galactose H-3 and for α-d-glucose H-1/α-d-galactose H-4, which confirm these connectivities (data not shown). Determination of the Linkage of the Phosphate in De-O-acetylated 11A PS-To determine the linkage of the glycerol phosphate, we acquired one-dimensional 31P spectra (supplemental Fig. 1B) and two-dimensional 1H-31P HMBC spectra of de-O-acetylated polysaccharide (Fig. 3A (black)). The de-O-acetylated polysaccharide has a single 31P peak at -0.31 ppm. This indicates that the core polysaccharide has a single phosphorous moiety with no heterogeneity in its local environment. This is in accord with 31P chemical shifts of di-substituted phosphodiesters, consistent with the presence of the glycerol-phosphatesaccharide moiety (17Merchant T.E. Glonek T. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 479-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 1H-31P HMBC data show three peaks (one is below the contour threshold) with the same 31P chemical shift (Fig. 3A, black). Two of the peaks are significantly more intense than the third and arise from the H-3 (3.98 and 3.91 ppm δH) of the glycerol moiety, confirming that connectivity. The other resonance corresponds to the α-d-glucose H-4 (α2) resonance (4.12 ppm δH), confirming the connectivity of the glycerol to this residue. Structure of De-O-acetylated 11A PS-We can then combine the results described above to determine the structure of the core ST11A polysaccharide. The α-d-Gal (α1) residue has three substitutions (H-1, H-4, and H-6), and α-d-Glc (α2) has only one PS substitution (H-1), as well as the pendant glycerol-phosphate moiety at H-4 as indicated by the 1H-31P data (Fig. 3A). In toto, all of the data lead to the structure shown in Fig. 4 (Table 1). Assignment of the Native 11A PS-The assignments of the core polysaccharide can be used to determine the assignments and acetylation of the native 11A polysaccharide. The one-dimensional 1H spectrum of native 11A PS is much more complex than the core polysaccharide spectrum, but this can be easily understood upon inspection of the 1H-13C HSQC spectrum (Fig. 1, red). There are six anomeric resonances (peaks between 95 and 104 ppm δC), and three sites of acetylation (peaks in the region between 4.7 and 5.7 ppm δH and 66 ppm to 76 ppm δC). Two of these anomeric peaks have the same chemical shifts as these peaks in the core structure (4.96, 100.8 (α2) and 4.56, 103.2 (β1)). With these as starting points, the six spin systems corresponding to the six anomeric resonances can be assigned. For example, the glycerol peaks do not shift from the de-O-acetylated to the native structure nor do the peaks associated with the β-d-glucose (β1) spin system or with α-d-glucose (α2) (Tables 1 and 2). There are new peaks that arise from the glycerol (this identity is confirmed by the multiplicity-edited 1H-13C HSQC and see below) and from the α-d-glucose because of acetylation of those residues. From these starting points, it is rather straightforward to assign the remaining spin systems (Table 2). Peak α2 (4.96 ppm), α3 (5.01 ppm), and α4 (5.07 ppm) all arise from the same residue in the repeat (α-d-Glc), but the changes in chemical shift reflect its variable acetylation (see below). Peak β2 has shifted downfield by 0.1 ppm δH as a result of O-acetylation at C-4. Peak α1 is perturbed because of the acetylation of the 2-position of the α-d-Glc linked to its C-4 position; this peak shifts by 0.05 ppm δH and 1.0 ppm δC. Peak β1 is not perturbed from the core structure because it is neither acetylated nor are any carbons proximal to it.TABLE 2Chemical shift assignment of native 11A PSResidue1234566′O-AcetylαGal (α1)5.12aChemical shifts (1H/13C[31P]) are in ppm and are referenced to DSS-d6 and DMSO-d6.

Open table in a new tab 31P Assignment of Native 11A PS-The one-dimensional 31P spectrum (supplemental Fig. 1A) shows a change in the phosphate; there are now three discrete 31P chemical shifts. This is shown clearly in the 1H-31P HMBC spectrum of the native 11A PS (Fig. 3A, red). The proton resonances corresponding to -0.21 and -0.31 ppm δP are the same, 3.98 and 3.91 ppm δH. These are the H-3 of the glycerol seen in the core structure. A new set of peaks also appears at 3.88 and 3.80 ppm δH and -0.70 ppm δP. These new peaks are still the H-3 of the glycerol that has been shifted upfield. This is because of acetylation of the H-1 of the glycerol (discussed below). As expected, there is no change in the linkage of the glycerol-phosphate moiety to the polysaccharide (Table 2). Determination of the Inter-residue Linkages of the Native 11A PS-Far fewer peaks were observed in the 1H-13C HMBC of the native PS than in the de-O-acetylated HMBC under the same experimental conditions, notably in the anomeric region (Fig. 5). Additional HMBC experiments were run with multiple bond couplings of 4, 10, 14, and 20 Hz to find parameters that would yield all of the anomeric (inter-residue) linkages for native 11A. The 20 and 14 Hz HMBC spectra were able to discern a few additional peaks (data not shown), but these were intra-residue peaks that were able to be determined via the HSQC-TOCSY. Three of the four peaks that are involved in connectivities between residues have minor chemical shift changes between the core and native structures (Fig. 1, denoted by asterisk). These peaks are easily mapped from the de-O-acetylated assignments. The one connected peak that shifts significantly is the β-d-Gal H-3 (Fig. 1, denoted by pound sign), which is adjacent to a fully acetylated residue. Fortuitously, its 1H chemical shift is not overlapped and lends itself to ready assignment. Therefore, even considering the limited set of observed HMBC cross-peaks with which to assign connectivities, we are able to confirm that the primary structure of 11A is a branched tetrasaccharide, consistent with what was seen for the core PS. Determination of the O-Acetylation of the Native 11A PS-In contrast to previous NMR studies (9Richards J.C. Perry M.B. Kniskern P.J. Can. J. Biochem.

Cryo-cooled probes give ∼4 times more signal/noise than conventional room temperature probes (11Kotsubo V. Nast R. Adv. Cryo. Eng. 1995; 41: 1857-1864Crossref Google Scholar, 24Russell D.J.

This allows for routine detection of carbon-correlated experiments, like the HSQC and HMBC, using natural abundance 13C. This is not always necessary, however, as it has been shown how to incorporate 13C post-isolation for NMR studies (25Yu F. Prestegard J.H. Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 1952-1959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The HMBC experiment can detect multiple carbon correlations from a given proton, typically three bonds away (H-C-X-C, where X is any heteroatom but typically oxygen in PSs). This corresponds to correlations from the anomeric proton to the intra-residue C-3 and C-5 and the inter-residue glycosidic carbon. HMBC correlations arising from the CH3 of acetyl groups will be more intense that those arising from CHs (because of the three identical protons of the acetyl methyl versus 1 for the CH). Correlation from the acetyl methyl group can lead to the detection of four bond couplings because of the very strong coupling of the carbonyl and the much greater initial intensity. As shown in Fig. 6, three correlations were detected arising from the acetate methyl (Fig. 6A) and two to the acetate carbonyl (Fig. 6B) by the HMBC experiment. The two most intense peaks (2.18 and 2.11 ppm δH) in Fig. 6A correlate to the carbon chemical shifts of the peak at 5.59 ppm and to the carbon chemical shifts of the CH2 with δH of 4.26 and 4.15 ppm, respectively. The peaks at 4.26/4.15 are quite intense relative to the rest of the carbohydrate peaks. In fact, the δC (∼63.3 ppm) indicates that they are glycerol peaks, rather than sugar peaks. This is further supported by both the 1H-13C HSQC-TOCSY (15, 35, 50, and 75-ms mix time), the 1H-1H TOCSY, the 1H-13C HMBC, and the multiplicityedited heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy, 3Multiplicity editing creates peaks with either positive or negative intensities depending on whether an even or odd number of protons are attached to the carbon. CH and CH3 groups will have the same sign, which will be the opposite sign of CH2 groups. which all confirm that these peaks are part of a glycerol spin system. 4E. R. Zartler, R. J. Porambo, J. Yu, and M. H. Nahm, manuscript in preparation. Based upon carbon chemical shifts and the 1H-31P data, the site of acetylation is C-1 (the carbon farthest from the phosphate, Fig. 7). Based upon relative intensities and comparison of integrals, the glycerol is O-acetylated with 0.5 eq of acetate per mol of repeating unit.FIGURE 7Re"

It has also infected people, especially children, causing severe illness and death. Although the virus shows limited ability to transmit between humans, A/H5N1 represents a potential source of the next influenza pandemic. This study assesses the safety and immunogenicity of aluminium hydroxide adjuvanted (Al) and non adjuvanted influenza A/Vietnam/1194/2004 NIBRG-14 (H5N1) vaccine in children.In a Phase II, open, randomised, multicentre trial 180 children aged 6 months to 17 years received two injections, 21 days apart, of vaccine containing either: 30 microg haemagglutinin (HA) with adjuvant (30 microg+Al) or 7.5 microg HA without adjuvant. An additional 60 children aged 6-35 months received two ""half dose"" injections (ie 15 microg+Al or 3.8 microg). Safety was followed for 21 days after vaccination. Antibody responses were assessed 21 days after each injection and cellular immune responses were explored. Vaccination appeared well tolerated in all age groups. The 30 microg+Al formulation was more immunogenic than 7.5 microg in all age groups: in these two groups 79% and 46% had haemagglutinination inhibition antibody titres > or =32 (1/dil). Among 6-35 month-olds, the full doses were more immunogenic than their half dose equivalents. Vaccination induced a predominantly Th2 response against H5 HA.This influenza A(H5N1) vaccine was well tolerated and immunogenic in children and infants, with Al adjuvant providing a clear immunogenic advantage. These results demonstrate that an H5N1 Al-adjuvanted vaccine, previously shown to be immunogenic and safe in adults, can also be used in children, the group most at risk for pandemic influenza."
https://openalex.org/W2078485026,"Herpesvirus infection of placenta may be harmful in pregnancy leading to disorders in fetal growth, premature delivery, miscarriage, or major congenital abnormalities. Although a correlation between human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) infection and abortion or low birth weight in children has been suggested, and rare cases of in utero or perinatal HHV-8 transmission have been documented, no direct evidence of HHV-8 infection of placenta has yet been reported. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo susceptibility of placental cells to HHV-8 infection. Short-term infection assays were performed on placental chorionic villi isolated from term placentae. Qualitative and quantitative HHV-8 detection were performed by PCR and real-time PCR, and HHV-8 proteins were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Term placenta samples from HHV-8-seropositive women were analyzed for the presence of HHV-8 DNA and antigens. In vitro infected histocultures showed increasing amounts of HHV-8 DNA in tissues and supernatants; cyto- and syncitiotrophoblasts, as well as endothelial cells, expressed latent and lytic viral antigens. Increased apoptotic phenomena were visualized by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine nick end-labeling method in infected histocultures. Ex vivo, HHV-8 DNA and a latent viral antigen were detected in placenta samples from HHV-8-seropositive women. These findings demonstrate that HHV-8, like other human herpesviruses, may infect placental cells in vitro and in vivo, thus providing evidence that this phenomenon might influence vertical transmission and pregnancy outcome in HHV-8-infected women."

RPA (also referred to as canonical RPA) is essential for cell viability (1Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar), and viable missense mutations in RPA subunits can lead to defects in DNA repair pathways or show increased chromosome instability. For example, a missense change in a high affinity DNA-binding domain (DBD) was demonstrated to cause a high rate of chromosome rearrangement and lymphoid tumor development in heterozygous mice (2Wang Y.

RPA is a highly conserved complex as all eukaryotes contain homologs of each of the three RPA subunits (1Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). At least some plants (e.g. rice) and some protists (e.g. Cryptosporidium parvum) contain multiple genes encoding for subunits of RPA (5Ishibashi T. Kimura S. Sakaguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2006; 139: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 6Rider Jr., S.D. Cai X. Sullivan Jr., W.J. Smith A.T. Radke J. White M. Zhu G. J. Biol.

In rice, there is evidence for multiple RPA complexes that are thought to perform different cellular functions (5Ishibashi T. Kimura S. Sakaguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2006; 139: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In contrast, only a single alternative form of RPA2, called RPA4, has been identified in humans (7Keshav K.F. Chen C. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3119-3128Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). RPA4 was originally identified as a protein that interacts with RPA1 in a yeast two-hybrid screen (7Keshav K.F. Chen C. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3119-3128Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The RPA4 subunit is 63% identical/similar to RPA2. Comparison of the sequences of RPA4 and RPA2 suggests that the two proteins have a similar domain organization. 4S. J. Haring, T. D. Humphreys, and M. S. Wold, submitted for publication.4S. J. Haring, T. D. Humphreys, and M. S. Wold, submitted for publication. RPA4 appears to contain a putative core DNA-binding domain (DBD G) flanked by a putative N-terminal phosphorylation domain and a C terminus containing a putative winged-helix domain (Fig. 1A). The RPA4 gene is located on the X chromosome, intronless, and found mainly in primates. 4S. J. Haring, T. D. Humphreys, and M. S. Wold, submitted for publication. Initial characterization of RPA4 by Keshav et al. (7Keshav K.F. Chen C. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3119-3128Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) indicated that either RPA2 or RPA4, but not both simultaneously, interacts with RPA1 and RPA3 to form a complex. This analysis also showed that RPA4 is expressed in placenta and colon tissue but was either not detected or expressed at low levels in most established cell lines examined (7Keshav K.F. Chen C. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3119-3128Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These studies describe the purification and functional analysis of an alternative RPA (aRPA) complex containing RPA1, RPA3, and RPA4. The aRPA complex is a stable heterotrimeric complex similar in size and stability to the canonical RPA complex (RPA1, RPA3, and RPA2). aRPA interacts with ssDNA in a manner indistinguishable from canonical RPA; however, it does not support DNA replication in vitro. Mixing experiments demonstrate that aRPA also inhibits canonical RPA from functioning in DNA replication. Hybrid protein studies paired with structural modeling have allowed for the identification of two regions of RPA4 responsible for this inhibitory activity. Data presented here are consistent with recent analyses of RPA4 function in human cells, 4S. J. Haring, T. D. Humphreys, and M. S. Wold, submitted for publication. and we conclude that RPA4 has anti-proliferative properties and has the potential to play a regulatory role in human cell proliferation through the control of DNA replication.

When dual vectors were used, both ampicillin (120 μg/ml) and kanamycin (30 μg/ml) were used for colony selection and growth. DNA Binding Assays—Gel mobility shift assays were carried out as described previously (11Binz S.K. Dickson A.M. Haring S.J. Wold M.S.

Briefly, indicated amounts of protein and radiolabeled oligonucleotide were incubated for 20 min at 25 °C in filter binding buffer (30 mm HEPES (diluted from 1 m stock at pH 7.8), 100 mm NaC1, 5 mm MgC12, 0.5% inositol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Reaction mixtures were separated on a 1% agarose gel in 0.1× Tris acetate-EDTA running buffer. Bound and free DNA from gel mobility shift experiments were quantitated using a Packard Instant Imager. Apparent affinity constants were calculated by nonlinear least squares fitting of the data to the Langmuir binding equation using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software) as described previously (13Kim C.

Standard reactions contained 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.5); 7 mm MgCl2;50 μm dCTP with 2.5 μCi (92.5 kBq) of [α-32P]dCTP; 100 μm each of dATP, dGTP, and dTTP; 200 μm each of CTP, GTP, and UTP; 4 mm ATP; 40 mm creatine phosphate; 2.5 μg of creatine kinase; 15 mm potassium phosphate; and 50 ng of pUC.HSO DNA template. RPA, usually 300 ng, was added as indicated. Each reaction also contained 100 μg of HeLa cell cytoplasmic extract and 0.2-0.5 μg of SV40 T-antigen. SV40 T-antigen was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography from Sf9 cells infected with a baculovirus vector containing the T-antigen gene as described previously (14Brush G.S. Kelly T.J. Stillman B. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 522-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Complementation assays were carried out using a 35-65% ammonium sulfate fraction of HeLa cell extract (11Binz S.K. Dickson A.M. Haring S.J. Wold M.S. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 409: 11-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 ml of complete extract was precipitated by the gradual addition of ammonium sulfate to 35%. The supernatant was further precipitated with 65% ammonium sulfate. The resulting precipitant was dissolved in one-fifth of the initial volume of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol and dialyzed to remove any residual ammonium sulfate. All reaction mixtures were assembled on ice and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The reactions were analyzed on gels as described previously (11Binz S.K. Dickson A.M. Haring S.J. Wold M.S. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 409: 11-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) or quantitated by precipitation by trichloroacetic acid; reactions were quenched by the addition of 0.1 m sodium pyrophosphate to a final concentration 80 mm and precipitated with 500 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid. The reaction mixtures were filtered through glass microfiber filters and radioactive DNA quantitated by liquid scintillation. SV40 T-antigen dependent elongation assays (15Walther A.P. Bjerke M.P. Wold M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 656-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) were done as described in the SV40 replication assay with the following modifications. Reactions were assembled as above except the [α-32P]dCTP was excluded from stage I. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, [α-32P]dCTP and RPA or RPA variants were added, and a stage II incubation was carried out for an additional hour at 37 °C. Products were analyzed as described above. RPA4 Forms a Stable, Functional ssDNA-binding Complex—Recombinant RPA4 was produced using methodology previously described to generate recombinant canonical RPA (10Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding RPA4 was cloned into a bacterial expression vector either alone, with RPA3, or with RPA1 and RPA3 and expressed in Escherichia coli. Overall, RPA4 had properties that were similar to those of recombinant RPA2 (10Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A His-tagged RPA4 gene expressed alone was predominantly insoluble (data not shown). When RPA4 was expressed with RPA3, both proteins were predominantly soluble and could be purified as a stable RPA4/3 complex (Fig. 1B and data not shown). When all three genes (RPA1, RPA4, RPA3) were expressed simultaneously, all three polypeptides were substantially soluble, and a complex, aRPA, could be purified to near homogeneity following the purification procedure used for canonical RPA (11Binz S.K. Dickson A.M. Haring S.J. Wold M.S. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 409: 11-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The expression of RPA4 in E. coli and the yield of aRPA complex after purification were similar to that for RPA (∼0.8 mg/liter of culture). The purified aRPA contained three intense bands of 70, 34, and 14 kDa (Fig. 1B). Although RPA4 has nine fewer amino acids than RPA2 and a predicted pI (6.07) slightly more basic than RPA2 (5.75), the RPA4 subunit consistently migrated slower in SDS-PAGE gels. We examined the hydrodynamic properties of aRPA and found them to be nearly indistinguishable from those of the canonical RPA complex; the sedimentation and Stokes' radius of aRPA were determined to be 5.0 s and 52.0 Å (versus 5.0 s and 51.2 Å for canonical RPA; Fig. 1C). The mass calculated for aRPA is in close agreement to that predicted from the amino acid sequence (Fig. 1C) and indicates RPA4 is forming a heterotrimeric complex with RPA1 and RPA3. The frictional coefficients for aRPA and RPA are both consistent with an elongated shape (16Gomes X.V. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10558-10568Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), which suggests that when RPA4 is substituted for RPA2, the overall shape of the complexes in solution is similar. The predicted sequence of RPA4 is 63% identical/similar to RPA2. 4S. J. Haring, T. D. Humphreys, and M. S. Wold, submitted for publication. This similarity allows homology modeling to be used to predict the structure of the putative domains of RPA4. The known structure of the DNA-binding domain of RPA2 (DBD D; 2PI2.pdb) is shown in Fig. 2A. The shallow, putative DNA-binding cleft between the L12 and L45 loops is indicated (17Deng X. Habel J.E. Kabaleeswaran V. Snell E.H. Wold M.S. Borgstahl G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 374: 865-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Two other prominent features of the structure are the flexible L34 loop (at the top of structure) and the C-terminal α helix, which has been shown to be part of the subunit interface of RPA2 (right side of structure) (17Deng X. Habel J.E. Kabaleeswaran V. Snell E.H. Wold M.S. Borgstahl G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 374: 865-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 18Bochkareva E. Korolev S. Lees-Miller S.P. Bochkarev A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1855-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The known structure for DBD D of RPA2 was used to model DBD G of RPA4 (Fig. 2A). The predicted structure of DBD G is very similar to that of DBD D, suggesting that the two domains may assume similar structures (Fig. 2A). However, comparison of the predicted surface charge of the DBDs of RPA2 and RPA4 indicates that the surface of RPA2 is much more acidic than that of RPA4 (Fig. 2A, lower row, see also below). In canonical RPA, two domains in RPA1 (DBD A and B) are both necessary and sufficient for high affinity DNA binding, and RPA2 contributes little to the overall affinity of the complex for ssDNA (19Walther A.P. Gomes X.V. Lao Y. Lee C.G. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3963-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 20Sibenaller Z.A. Sorensen B.R. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12496-12506Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 21Fanning E. Klimovich V. Nager A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4126-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Therefore, aRPA, which contains RPA1, RPA4, and RPA3, was expected to bind ssDNA with high affinity. We analyzed the binding affinity of purified aRPA to (dT)30 by gel mobility shift assays. The binding of canonical RPA and aRPA is very similar; nearly equivalent concentrations of protein were needed to form a complex, and only one protein-DNA species was observed (Fig. 3A). Quantitation of the titrations demonstrated that both RPA complexes have high affinity for ssDNA; Kd equals 7.5 × 10-9 m for RPA and 20 × 10-9 m for aRPA (Fig. 3B). Binding was also examined with longer oligonucleotides, (dT)50 and (dT)70. Only one protein-DNA species was observed with (dT)50, whereas two distinct protein-DNA bands were observed with dT70 for both aRPA and RPA (Fig. 3A), suggesting that for high concentrations of both proteins, two molecules bind to dT70. Together these data indicated that the occluded binding site of aRPA is 25-35 nucleotides, which is comparable with the binding site size of RPA (13Kim C. Paulus B.F. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14197-14206Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The occluded binding site size was confirmed with stoichiometric reverse titrations monitoring changes in intrinsic protein fluorescence as described by Kim et al. (13Kim C. Paulus B.F. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14197-14206Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) (data not shown). These analyses also indicate that aRPA binds with low cooperativity similar to RPA because if aRPA bound with high cooperativity, a single transition would have been observed with dT70 rather than a gradual transition between single- and double-liganded species (Fig. 3A). We conclude that aRPA has ssDNA binding properties indistinguishable from canonical RPA; it binds ssDNA with high affinity and low cooperativity. aRPA Function in SV40 Replication—RPA was originally identified as a protein essential for simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA replication (22Wold M.S. Kelly T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2523-2527Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar); therefore, we examined whether aRPA could support SV40 DNA replication. Cell extracts derived from human tissue culture cells contain all of the cellular proteins required for SV40 replication, except the viral protein large T antigen (Tag) (23Kelly T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17889-17892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RPA is required for SV40 replication and is present in the cell extracts (22Wold M.S. Kelly T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2523-2527Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar); however, the extracts can be depleted of RPA using ammonium sulfate fractionation, making the DNA synthesis dependent on both Tag and RPA (11Binz S.K. Dickson A.M. Haring S.J. Wold M.S. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 409: 11-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). RPA-depleted, ammonium sulfate-fractionated extract (AS-Ex) is unable to support DNA synthesis in the presence of Tag unless the reaction is also supplemented with RPA (Fig. 4A, bars 1-3). A complete reaction with canonical RPA gives robust DNA synthesis (Fig. 4A, bar 3). In contrast, supplementation with aRPA results in only background levels of DNA synthesis (Fig. 4A, bar 4). Background synthesis was also observed when purified RPA4/3 complex was added in place of RPA (data not shown). Replication of the SV40 origin containing DNA occurs by two mechanisms in these reactions: circle-to-circle and rolling circle. These mechanisms produce different products, circles and long linear DNA, respectively (Fig. 4B) (15Walther A.P. Bjerke M.P. Wold M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 656-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Analysis of the products by gel electrophoresis showed that aRPA did not support the formation of either type of product (Fig. 4B, left panel). We conclude that although aRPA binds ssDNA with high affinity, it is unable to support SV40 DNA replication. Interestingly, the addition of aRPA to unfractionated extracts also showed only background levels of synthesis (data not shown). This is surprising because canonical RPA is present in these unfractionated extracts and normally supports replication. Reactions containing both purified aRPA and purified RPA were analyzed. Additional canonical RPA (double the normal amount) in the reaction results in a modest increase in DNA synthesis (Fig. 4A, bar 10). When aRPA was added in the presence of equal amounts of RPA, no DNA synthesis was observed (Fig. 4A, bar 11). This demonstrates that aRPA has a dominant negative effect on the function of canonical RPA in SV40 DNA replication. This effect does not appear to be caused by dissociation of the aRPA complex or subunit exchange because the addition of the purified RPA4/3 complex had no effect on a complete SV40 replication containing canonical RPA (data not shown). RPA2 and RPA4 are both composed of three distinct functional domains: the phosphorylation domain, a DBD, and a winged-helix domain (Fig. 1A). To determine what region(s) of RPA4 is responsible for the properties of aRPA in DNA replication, three hybrid proteins were generated in which the phosphorylation domain, the DBD, or the C terminus of RPA2 was replaced with the corresponding domain of RPA4, named RPA2 (422), RPA2 (242), and RPA2 (224), respectively (Fig. 2B). These domain hybrid proteins were expressed with RPA1 and RPA3, and the resulting complexes were purified. All three complexes purified with a yield similar to RPA and bound (dT)30 with an affinity equivalent to wild-type RPA (data not shown). When the trimeric complexes, RPA·2 (422), RPA·2 (242), and RPA·2 (224), were examined for the ability to support DNA synthesis, only the RPA·2 (422) hybrid complex was able to support wild-type levels of DNA synthesis (Fig. 4A, bars 5-7). RPA·2 (242) and RPA·2 (224) both supported levels of synthesis that were slightly above background and aRPA levels. We conclude that the phosphorylation domain of RPA4 is not responsible for the phenotype observed with aRPA. These data also indicate that both the DBD and the winged-helix domains of RPA2 are necessary for RPA function in SV40 DNA replication and that both of these domains of RPA4 are contributing to the aRPA phenotype. Mixing experiments were also carried out with the RPA2-RPA4 hybrids. RPA·2 (422) did not inhibit the function of RPA and showed levels of synthesis comparable with that of RPA alone. Both RPA·2 (242) and RPA·2 (224) showed levels of DNA synthesis that were significantly reduced from that of RPA (t test; p < 0.005 and p < 0.001, respectively) but greater than that of aRPA (Fig. 4A, bars 12-14). RPA·2 (224) consistently showed more inhibition than RPA·2 (242), suggesting that the two domains may have different effects on SV40 DNA replication. We conclude that both the DBD and the winged-helix domain of aRPA are contributing to the inhibitory effect of RPA4. Mechanism of aRPA Inhibition of SV40 Replication—RPA is required for both initiation and elongation phases of DNA replication. To examine which phase of replication is being affected by aRPA, two-stage elongation assays were carried out. Time course experiments have shown that in the SV40 replication reaction, initiation predominantly occurs during early times (stage I), and at later times (stage II), only elongation synthesis on rolling-circle intermediates is occurring (15Walther A.P. Bjerke M.P. Wold M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 656-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible to examine aRPA function in elongation in a two-stage reaction. Stage I contains all the components necessary for initiation and elongation of SV40 origin-containing DNA except for the radioactive dCTP tracer. This stage is incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, during which normal initiation and elongation occur, but the DNA synthesized is not labeled. In stage II, [α-32P]dCTP and various forms of RPA are added, the incubation is continued for 1 h, and the elongation DNA synthesis is quantitated. This assay measures DNA synthesis occurring during the elongation phase and is independent of the initiation processes (15Walther A.P. Bjerke M.P. Wold M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 656-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Substantial elongation synthesis was observed in the stage II elongation phase (Fig. 5A, bar 2). This synthesis was dependent on the presence of RPA from the start of the reaction and could be stimulated by additional RPA at the beginning of stage II (Fig. 5A, bars 1-3). aRPA strongly inhibits elongation synthesis, demonstrating that aRPA inhibits the normal function of canonical RPA at the pre-existing replication fork (Fig. 5A, bar 4). This strong inhibition was not observed with the hybrid subunits (Fig. 5A, bars 5-7). RPA·2 (422) causes a slight increase in elongation synthesis similar to the addition of canonical RPA (t test; p < 0.0005) and consistent with its ability to promote replication. RPA·2 (224) had no effect on elongation synthesis (t test; p < 0.11), whereas RPA·2 (242) showed slightly reduced levels of DNA synthesis (t test; p < 0.001). Together these experiments indicate that the putative phosphorylation domain of RPA4 has no role in inhibiting elongation synthesis, whereas DBD G of RPA4 inhibits elongation synthesis. Interestingly, the putative winged helix of RPA4 appears to have a separation of function phenotype. Although this region results in inhibition of the complete SV40 DNA synthesis, it does not affect elongation synthesis. This suggests that the putative winged helix-containing C terminus of RPA4 is defective for replication initiation only. Structural Basis of RPA4 Inhibition—The DNA-binding domains of RPA2 and RPA4 are predicted to have similar structures but very different electrostatic surface potentials (Fig. 2A). Because the solution structure of the C-terminal region of RPA2 is known (24Arunkumar A.I. Klimovich V. Jiang X. Ott R.D. Mizoue L. Fanning E. Chazin W.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 332-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we used homology modeling to predict the structure of the C terminus of RPA4. Fig. 2C shows that the predicted structure for the winged helix of RPA4 is very similar to the known structure of the RPA2 winged helix. The predicted surface potential is predominantly acidic for both winged-helix domains; however, the N terminus of the predicted winged helix of RPA4 is much more acidic than the equivalent region of RPA2 (Fig. 2C). The inhibition studies discussed above suggest that the putative winged-helix domain of RPA4 is inhibiting initiation; RPA·2 (224) inhibits the complete reaction but has no effect on elongation synthesis. This is consistent with a previous analysis that described an important role for the winged-helix domain of RPA2 in initiation of SV40 replication (24Arunkumar A.I. Klimovich V. Jiang X. Ott R.D. Mizoue L. Fanning E. Chazin W.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 332-33"
https://openalex.org/W2013664936,"Recognising complex three-dimensional objects presents significant challenges to visual systems when these objects are rotated in depth. The image processing requirements for reliable individual recognition under these circumstances are computationally intensive since local features and their spatial relationships may significantly change as an object is rotated in the horizontal plane. Visual experience is known to be important in primate brains learning to recognise rotated objects, but currently it is unknown how animals with comparatively simple brains deal with the problem of reliably recognising objects when seen from different viewpoints. We show that the miniature brain of honeybees initially demonstrate a low tolerance for novel views of complex shapes (e.g. human faces), but can learn to recognise novel views of stimuli by interpolating between or ‘averaging’ views they have experienced. The finding that visual experience is also important for bees has important implications for understanding how three dimensional biologically relevant objects like flowers are recognised in complex environments, and for how machine vision might be taught to solve related visual problems."
https://openalex.org/W1988827229,"Background The potential physiological significance of the nanophase transition of neutral lipids in the core of low density lipoprotein (LDL) particles is dependent on whether the rate is fast enough to integrate small (±2°C) temperature changes in the blood circulation. Methodology/Principal Findings Using sub-second, time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering technology with synchrotron radiation, we have monitored the dynamics of structural changes within LDL, which were triggered by temperature-jumps and -drops, respectively. Our findings reveal that the melting transition is complete within less than 10 milliseconds. The freezing transition proceeds slowly with a half-time of approximately two seconds. Thus, the time period over which LDL particles reside in cooler regions of the body readily facilitates structural reorientation of the apolar core lipids. Conclusions/Significance Low density lipoproteins, the biological nanoparticles responsible for the transport of cholesterol in blood, are shown to act as intrinsic nano-thermometers, which can follow the periodic temperature changes during blood circulation. Our results demonstrate that the lipid core in LDL changes from a liquid crystalline to an oily state within fractions of seconds. This may, through the coupling to the protein structure of LDL, have important repercussions on current theories of the role of LDL in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2130748155,"Ovarian carcinoma is the most important cause of gynecological cancer-related mortality in Western societies. Despite the improved median overall survival in patients receiving chemotherapy regimens such as paclitaxel and carboplatin combination, relapse still occurs in most advanced diseased patients. Increased angiogenesis is associated with rapid recurrence and decreased survival in ovarian cancer. This study was planned to identify an angiogenesis-related gene expression profile with prognostic value in advanced ovarian carcinoma patients.RNAs were collected from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples of 61 patients with III/IV FIGO stage ovarian cancer who underwent surgical cytoreduction and received a carboplatin plus paclitaxel regimen. Expression levels of 82 angiogenesis related genes were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction using TaqMan low-density arrays. A 34-gene-profile which was able to predict the overall survival of ovarian carcinoma patients was identified. After a leave-one-out cross validation, the profile distinguished two groups of patients with different outcomes. Median overall survival and progression-free survival for the high risk group was 28.3 and 15.0 months, respectively, and was not reached by patients in the low risk group at the end of follow-up. Moreover, the profile maintained an independent prognostic value in the multivariate analysis. The hazard ratio for death was 2.3 (95% CI, 1.5 to 3.2; p<0.001).It is possible to generate a prognostic model for advanced ovarian carcinoma based on angiogenesis-related genes using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples. The present results are consistent with the increasing weight of angiogenesis genes in the prognosis of ovarian carcinoma."

https://openalex.org/W2077468986,"Background and Objectives The aim of this study was to estimate the proportion of spontaneous viral clearance (SVC) after symptomatic acute hepatitis C and to evaluate the efficacy of 12 weeks of pegylated interferon alfa-2a in patients who did not clear the virus spontaneously. Methods Patients with symptomatic acute hepatitis C were recruited from two “fever hospitals” in Cairo, Egypt. Patients still viremic three months after the onset of symptoms were considered for treatment with 12 weeks of pegylated interferon alfa-2a (180 µg/week). Results Between May 2002 and February 2006, 2243 adult patients with acute hepatitis were enrolled in the study. The SVC rate among 117 patients with acute hepatitis C was 33.8% (95%CI [25.9%–43.2%]) at three months and 41.5% (95%CI [33.0%–51.2%]) at six months. The sustained virological response (SVR) rate among the 17 patients who started treatment 4–6 months after onset of symptoms was 15/17 = 88.2% (95%CI [63.6%–98.5%]). Conclusion Spontaneous viral clearance was high (41.5% six months after the onset of symptoms) in this population with symptomatic acute hepatitis C. Allowing time for spontaneous clearance should be considered before treatment is initiated for symptomatic acute hepatitis C."
https://openalex.org/W2091369957,"Minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins are believed to provide the replicative helicase activity in eukaryotes and archaea. The single MCM orthologue from Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus (MthMCM) has been extensively characterized as a model of the eukaryotic heterohexameric MCM complex. MthMCM forms high molecular weight complexes in solution consistent with a dodecamer. Visualization of this complex by electron microscopy suggests that single and double heptameric or hexameric rings can form. We have mutated two arginine residues (Arg-137, Arg-160) in the N-terminal subdomain B of MthMCM based on their apparent potential to form inter-ring hydrogen bonds. Both the single R137A and the double R137A,R160A mutants were characterized by a combination of biophysical, biochemical, and electron microscopy techniques. Biophysical analysis coupled with electron microscopy studies shows that the R137A mutant forms a double heptameric ring, whereas the R137A,R160A protein assembles as a single heptamer. They both show a defect in DNA binding and a concomitant conformational change in subdomain A, with the double mutant displaying significant defects in helicase activity as well. We propose a model in which MCM loading and the subsequent activation of the helicase activity involve a conformational transition that is connected to a DNA binding event."
https://openalex.org/W2004704620,"The Drosophila mushroom body (MB) is a higher olfactory center where olfactory and other sensory information are thought to be associated. However, how MB neurons of Drosophila respond to sensory stimuli other than odor is not known. Here, we characterized the responses of MB neurons to a change in airflow, a stimulus associated with odor perception. In vivo calcium imaging from MB neurons revealed surprisingly strong and dynamic responses to an airflow stimulus. This response was dependent on the movement of the 3(rd) antennal segment, suggesting that Johnston's organ may be detecting the airflow. The calyx, the input region of the MB, responded homogeneously to airflow on. However, in the output lobes of the MB, different types of MB neurons responded with different patterns of activity to airflow on and off. Furthermore, detailed spatial analysis of the responses revealed that even within a lobe that is composed of a single type of MB neuron, there are subdivisions that respond differently to airflow on and off. These subdivisions within a single lobe were organized in a stereotypic manner across flies. For the first time, we show that changes in airflow affect MB neurons significantly and these effects are spatially organized into divisions smaller than previously defined MB neuron types."
https://openalex.org/W2006047046,"Genetically-encoded biosensors based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) have been widely applied to study the spatiotemporal regulation of molecular activity in live cells with high resolution. The efficient and accurate quantification of the large amount of imaging data from these single-cell FRET measurements demands robust and automated data analysis. However, the nonlinear movement of live cells presents tremendous challenge for this task. Based on image registration of the single-cell movement, we have developed automated image analysis methods to track and quantify the FRET signals within user-defined subcellular regions. In addition, the subcellular pixels were classified according to their associated FRET signals and the dynamics of the clusters analyzed. The results revealed that the EGF-induced reduction of RhoA activity in migratory HeLa cells is significantly less than that in stationary cells. Furthermore, the RhoA activity is polarized in the migratory cells, with the gradient of polarity oriented toward the opposite direction of cell migration. In contrast, there is a lack of consistent preference in RhoA polarity among stationary cells. Therefore, our image analysis methods can provide powerful tools for high-throughput and systematic investigation of the spatiotemporal molecular activities in regulating functions of live cells with their shapes and positions continuously changing in time."
https://openalex.org/W2024746874,"Homologous recombination is essential for maintaining genomic integrity. A common repair mechanism, it uses a homologous or homeologous donor as a template for repair of a damaged target gene. Such repair must be regulated, both to identify appropriate donors for repair, and to avoid excess or inappropriate recombination. We show that modifications of donor chromatin structure can promote homology-directed repair. These experiments demonstrate that either the activator VP16 or the histone chaperone, HIRA, accelerated gene conversion approximately 10-fold when tethered within the donor array for Ig gene conversion in the chicken B cell line DT40. VP16 greatly increased levels of acetylated histones H3 and H4, while tethered HIRA did not affect histone acetylation, but caused an increase in local nucleosome density and levels of histone H3.3. Thus, epigenetic modification can stimulate genetic variation. The evidence that distinct activating modifications can promote similar functional outcomes suggests that a variety of chromatin changes may regulate homologous recombination, and that disregulation of epigenetic marks may have deleterious genetic consequences."
https://openalex.org/W2086596964,"A synthetic peptide based on the leash and α-helical region (LHR) of human T cell leukemia virus type 1 envelope is a potent inhibitor of viral entry into cells. The inhibitory peptide targets a triple-stranded coiled-coil motif of the fusion-active transmembrane glycoprotein and in a trans-dominant negative manner blocks resolution to the trimer-of-hairpins form. The LHR-mimetic is, therefore, functionally analogous to the C34/T20-type inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus. Previous attempts to shorten the bioactive peptide produced peptides with severely attenuated activity. We now demonstrate that truncated peptides often suffer from poor solubility and impaired coiled coil binding properties, and we identify features that are critical to peptide function. In particular, the α-helical region of the LHR-mimetic is necessary but not sufficient for inhibitory activity. Moreover, two basic residues are crucial for coiled-coil binding and efficient inhibition of membrane fusion. By retaining these basic residues and a region of main chain peptide contacts with the coiled coil, a core LHR-mimetic was obtained that retains both the inhibitory properties and solubility profile of the parental peptide. Variants of the core peptide inhibit both membrane fusion and infection of cells by free viral particles, but unexpectedly, infection by virions was more susceptible to inhibition by low activity inhibitors than syncytium formation. The core inhibitor provides a valuable lead in the search for smaller more bio-available peptides and peptido-mimetics that possess anti-viral activity. Such molecules may be attractive candidates for therapeutic intervention in human T cell leukemia virus type 1 infections. A synthetic peptide based on the leash and α-helical region (LHR) of human T cell leukemia virus type 1 envelope is a potent inhibitor of viral entry into cells. The inhibitory peptide targets a triple-stranded coiled-coil motif of the fusion-active transmembrane glycoprotein and in a trans-dominant negative manner blocks resolution to the trimer-of-hairpins form. The LHR-mimetic is, therefore, functionally analogous to the C34/T20-type inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus.

To infect and pass between cells, enveloped viruses are dependent upon the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. Fusion is mediated by virally encoded homo-trimeric class I fusion glycoproteins and is initiated by a trigger such as receptor binding or decreased local pH and is achieved by extensive conformational changes within the fusion protein (1Eckert D.M. Kim P.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 777-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). After activation, an N-terminal hydrophobic peptide is thrust into the target cell membrane to yield a rod-like pre-hairpin intermediate, which remains anchored at the C terminus to the viral membrane and thereby bridges the opposing membranes (1Eckert D.M. Kim P.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 777-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar, 2Weissenhorn W. Dessen A. Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C.

The pre-hairpin intermediate then resolves to a trimer-of-hairpins or six-helix bundle in which the C and N termini of the fusion protein are drawn together to bring the interacting membranes into close proximity, promoting lipid mixing and ultimately driving the formation of a fusion pore through which the viral capsid can pass to the cytoplasm of the target cell (1Eckert D.M.

The retroviral envelope complex is composed of a trimer of surface glycoproteins linked to a trimer of the transmembrane glycoproteins (TM), 3The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane glycoprotein; CD, circular dichroism; MBP, maltose-binding protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TFE, trifluoroethanol; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; LHR, leash and α-helical region; HTLV-1, human T cell leukemia virus. a typical class 1 fusion protein. During fusion, the TM pre-hairpin intermediate is stabilized by a triple-stranded coiled coil that is assembled from an N-terminal α-helix from each of the TM monomers (6Sjoberg M. Lindqvist B. Garoff H. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 2358-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). It is thought that during fusion the coiled coil is exposed to solvent for several minutes before resolution to the trimer-of-hairpins conformation (7Munoz-Barroso I. Durell S. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Blumenthal R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). For several viruses the coiled coil is a target of exogenous synthetic peptides that are potent inhibitors of membrane fusion and viral entry (8Jiang S. Lin K. Strick N. Neurath A.R.

The inhibitory peptides emulate the C-terminal sequences of the trimer of hairpins and, by binding to the coiled coil, act in a trans-dominant negative manner to block resolution to the trimer-of-hairpins structure (1Eckert D.M. Kim P.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 777-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar, 3Furuta R.A. Wild C.T. Weng Y. Weiss C.D. Nat. Struct.

The prototypic fusion inhibitor derived from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is extensively α-helical when bound to the HIV-1 core coiled coil (2Weissenhorn W. Dessen A. Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar, 17Chan D.C. Fass D. Berger J.M. Kim P.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar). By contrast, the TM region of human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV-1) that is mimicked by inhibitory peptides is atypical in that it displays a short α-helical motif flanked by extended non-helical leash regions (Fig. 1A) (18Kobe B. Center R.J. Kemp B.E. Poumbourios P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4319-4324Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). A synthetic peptide (Pcr-400) that is based on amino acid residues 400-429 of HTLV-1 envelope and includes the leash and α-helical region (LHR) of the HTLV-1 TM is a potent and highly specific inhibitor of HTLV-1-mediated membrane fusion and viral entry (9Pinon J.D. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Flanagan J.U. Brighty D.W. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3281-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 19Lamb D. Schuttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M. Brighty D.W. Retrovirology. 2008; 5: 70Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The synthetic peptide exhibits little α-helicity in aqueous solution but has a propensity to adopt a partially α-helical configuration in non-aqueous solvent (9Pinon J.D. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Flanagan J.U. Brighty D.W. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3281-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The peptide binds to a recombinant HTLV-1 coiled coil but fails to interact with the six-helix bundle of TM (9Pinon J.D. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Flanagan J.U. Brighty D.W. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3281-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Mirsaliotis A. Nurkiyanova K. Lamb D. Kuo C.W. Brighty D.W. J. Gen. Virol. 2007; 88: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Moreover, specific amino acid substitutions within the peptide impair binding to the recombinant coiled coil and disrupt the inhibitory properties of the peptide (21Mirsaliotis A. Lamb D. Brighty D.W. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 4965-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Thus, the accumulated data indicate that the inhibitory peptide faithfully mimics the extended leash and α-helical structures of the C-terminal domain of the HTLV-1 trimer-of-hairpins. Viral replication is ongoing in HTLV-1-infected individuals, and high viral loads are frequently observed in HTLV-1-associated disease (22Yamano Y. Nagai M. Brennan M. Mora C.A. Soldan S.S. Tomaru U. Takenouchi N. Izumo S. Osame M. Jacobson S. Blood. 2002; 99: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 23Hanon E. Asquith R.E. Taylor G.P. Tanaka Y. Weber J.N. Bangham C.R. AIDS Res. Hum.

Moreover, viral envelope is a key player in cell-to-cell transfer of HTLV-1 and in infection of dendritic cells by free viral particles (25Igakura T. Stinchcombe J.C. Goon P.K. Taylor G.P. Weber J.N. Griffiths G.M. Tanaka Y. Osame M. Bangham C.R. Science. 2003; 299: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 26Jones K.S. Petrow-Sadowski C. Huang Y.K. Bertolette D.C. Ruscetti F.W. Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Therefore, antagonists of envelope function are likely to be of value in the treatment of HTLV-1 infections. The peptide Pcr-400, therefore, represents an attractive lead molecule from which therapeutically relevant inhibitors of viral entry can be derived. A critical objective in the design of small peptide or peptido-mimetic compounds based on Pcr-400 is the identification of a minimal region that is required for inhibitory activity of the peptide. However, attempts to truncate Pcr-400 have produced peptides that exhibit greatly compromised activity (21Mirsaliotis A. Lamb D. Brighty D.W. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 4965-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The confounding issue for such peptides is that reducing the surface of interaction results in a loss of binding affinity and may remove critical determinants of specificity. Therefore, we sought to identify features that limit the activity of short peptides and to identify a core region of Pcr-400 that retains inhibitory potency. We now demonstrate that LHR-based peptides can be reduced in length while maintaining activity. The α-helical segment of the LHR is required but is not sufficient for peptide activity. By contrast, two charged residues are of particular functional importance and define a limit for C-terminal truncations and provide support to the view that interactions of LHR-based peptides with the extreme N terminus of the core coiled coil are vital to inhibitory function. Nevertheless, interactions between the N-terminal end of the inhibitory peptide and the coiled coil are also required for optimal activity. The implications for inhibitor design are discussed.

Peptide Synthesis-Peptides (Table 1) were synthesized using standard solid-phase Fmoc chemistry and have acetylated N termini and amidated C termini. The peptides were purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and verified for purity by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. All peptides were dissolved in DMSO. Where possible, peptide concentration was confirmed by absorbance at 280 nm in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, and peptides were used at the final concentrations indicated. In all experiments shown each replicate was carried out using separate peptide stock solutions to allow for slight variations in peptide concentration for those peptides with no absorbance at 280 nm. In addition, far UV absorbance values were used to assess solubility and concentration given that peptide bonds absorb strongly between 190 and 225 nm with little variation in response between different proteins (29Price N.C. Engel P.C. The Determination of Protein Concentration in Enzymology Labfax. Bios Scientific Publishers, Oxford1996: 34-41Google Scholar). For these measurements, stock peptides were dissolved in organic solvent as DMSO absorbs strongly in the far UV region. Samples were centrifuged before UV analysis to remove any insoluble peptide, and values at 310 nm were also taken to check for the possibility of light-scattering artifacts.TABLE 1Peptides used in this studyPeptideAmino acid positionSequenceMrPcr-400gp21 400-429CCFLNITNSHVSILQERPPLENRVLTGWGL3411Pcr-ΔNgp21 412-429I----------------L2091Pcr-ΔCgp21 400-419C------------------L2326Pcr-Δ8gp21 403-424L--------------------L2583Pcr-ΔCysgp21 401-429C---------------------------L3350Pcr-Δ3gp21 401-427C-------------------------W3179Pcr-Δ5gp21 401-425C-----------------------T2936Pcr-Δ7gp21 401-423C---------------------V2721Pcr-R416Agp21 401-423C--------------A------V2635Pcr-R422Agp21 401-423C--------------------AV2635Pcr-P417Ggp21 401-423C---------------G-----V2680Pcr-P418Ggp21 401-423C----------------G----V2680Pcr-F402Agp21 401-423CA--------------------V2644C34gp41 627-661GWMEWDREINNYTSLLIHSLIEESQNQQEKNEQELL4418 Open table in a new tab Determination of Peptide Solubility-Serial dilutions (2-fold) of stock peptide in DMSO were performed with filtered PBS to a total volume of 200 μl and a final DMSO concentration of 1.5% in duplicate wells of a 96-well microplate. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 h, and the relative solubility of peptides was established by measuring forward scattered light using a NEPHELOstar laser-based microplate nephelometer (BMG LABTECH). Wells containing PBS, 1.5% DMSO were used as blanks. Data analysis was carried out using ActivityBase, and peptides giving readings up to and including 3-fold higher than the average reading for the DMSO control were considered to be in solution at the concentrations specified. Circular Dichroism (CD) Measurements-To examine the secondary structures of the peptides and their propensities to form α-helices, CD measurements were obtained in both aqueous buffer and buffer containing 50% (v/v) trifluoroethanol (TFE) at 20 °C on a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter. Spectra were recorded using peptide concentrations of 0.3 mg/ml in a 0.02-cm path length quartz cuvette. The results were analyzed using the CDSSTR procedure hosted by DICHROWEB (30Kelly S.M.

Expression and Purification of MBP-TM Proteins-Expression and purification of the MBP-TM proteins was carried out as previously described (9Pinon J.D. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Flanagan J.U. Brighty D.W. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3281-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The oligomerization status of the protein chimeras was assessed by Superdex 200 gel filtration chromatography in PBS (data not shown; see Ref. 9Pinon J.D. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Flanagan J.U. Brighty D.W. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3281-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was estimated by Bradford assay, and the recombinant protein was stored at -80 °C in PBS supplemented with 20% glycerol. Peptide Competition Binding Assays-The ability of peptides to bind to the core coiled coil was examined using a previously described competition binding assay (20Mirsaliotis A. Nurkiyanova K. Lamb D. Kuo C.W. Brighty D.W. J. Gen. Virol. 2007; 88: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). 96-Well microtiter plates (NUNC MAXI-Sorp) were coated overnight at 4 °C with MBP-Fishhook (recombinant core coiled coil; 10 μg ml-1) or control protein (MBP, or MBP-Hairpin) diluted in PBS, pH 7.2. Plates were washed twice with wash buffer (PBS, 0.2% Tween 20) and blocked with blocking buffer (5% Marvel in wash buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. The biotinylated peptide Bio-Pcr-400 was prepared as a stock solution in wash buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) such that the final DTT concentration in the wells would be 5 mm when an equal volume of competing peptide/buffer was added. Bio-Pcr-400 was incubated with the immobilized core coiled coil in the presence or absence of peptide competitors at room temperature for 1 h. Plates were washed (×5) in wash buffer to remove unbound peptide, incubated for 1 h with 100 μl streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) (1:10,000 dilution) at room temperature. Plates were then washed (×5) in wash buffer to remove unbound streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and washed again (×2) in PBS to remove residual detergent. Bound streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and, therefore, bound Bio-Pcr-400 was detected using 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) substrate at 15 mg ml-1 dissolved in 0.1 m citric acid, pH 4.0, supplemented with 0.06% H2O2, and the absorbance at 415 nm was read using a Bio-Rad plate reader. Note that in these assays Bio-Pcr-400 did not bind to control proteins MBP or MBP-Hairpin (data not shown; Ref. 20Mirsaliotis A. Nurkiyanova K. Lamb D. Kuo C.W. Brighty D.W. J. Gen. Virol. 2007; 88: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Syncytium Interference Assay-Syncytium interference assays were carried out as previously described (9Pinon J.D. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Flanagan J.U. Brighty D.W. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3281-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 32Jassal S.R. Pohler R.G. Brighty D.W. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8317-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 × 105 HeLa cells transfected with the HTLV-1 envelope expression vector pHTE-1 using GeneJuice (Merck) were added to 7 × 105 untransfected HeLa target cells. The effector and target cells were cocultured in the presence or absence of peptides at the concentrations specified for 12-15 h at 37 °C and then washed twice with PBS and fixed in PBS, 3% paraformaldehyde. Assays were performed in triplicate, and the number of syncytia from 10 low-power fields was scored by light microscopy. Nonlinear regression analyses of the dose response curves and subsequent calculation of peptide concentrations required to give 50% inhibition of syncytium formation (IC50) were performed using GraphPad Prism 4.0. Viral Pseudotyping Assays-293T cells at 70% confluence were co-transfected with equal quantities of pHTE-1 and pNL4-3.Luc.R-.E- using transIT®-LT1 (Mirus). After 24 h the supernatant was removed, and fresh media containing 10 mm sodium butyrate was added. After 18-20 h, the supernatant was removed, and the cells were washed once with media and incubated for 48 h in fresh media without sodium butyrate. Virus-containing supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 2500 rpm (Heraeus Instruments Labofuge 400) for 5 min followed by filtration through a 0.22 μm filter to remove cell debris. 300 μl of this supernatant was then added to 5 × 105 HOS cells in the presence or absence of peptides at the concentrations specified. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h before the supernatant was removed and replaced with fresh media. The cells were incubated for a further 24 h to maximize retroviral gene expression, washed with PBS, and lysed using cell lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was determined for each lysate using the Promega luciferase assay system and a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs). Luciferase data were normalized according to lysate protein concentration as determined by Bradford assay. Extensive Truncation of Pcr-400 Reduces Potency-Pcr-400 is a 30-amino acid synthetic peptide modeled on residues 400-429 of the HTLV-1 envelope glycoprotein. The peptide is an effective inhibitor of HTLV-1 envelope-catalyzed membrane fusion, and it fulfils this function by binding to the core coiled coil of HTLV-1 TM (9Pinon J.D. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Flanagan J.U. Brighty D.W. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3281-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that truncation of Pcr-400 by 12 amino acids at the N terminus (Pcr-ΔN) or alternatively by 10 amino acids at the C terminus (Pcr-ΔC) produced peptides with radically reduced inhibitory properties (21Mirsaliotis A. Lamb D. Brighty D.W. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 4965-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The truncated peptides failed to inhibit HTLV-1 membrane fusion and syncytium formation even at concentrations up to 10-fold higher than the IC50 of the parental peptide Pcr-400. The truncated peptides display substantially reduced solubility in aqueous solution but are soluble at concentrations equivalent to and 10-fold greater than the IC50 of the parental peptide Pcr-400 (Table 2). Therefore, it is likely that the truncated peptides failed to inhibit due to relatively weak binding to the core coiled coil of HTLV-1 TM. Because identification of shorter bioactive peptides is an important first step in the development of novel more “drug-like” anti-HTLV-1 peptides, the inhibitory properties of the truncated peptides were examined over a considerably extended concentration range. Syncytium interference assays revealed that peptide Pcr-ΔC does retain some inhibitory activity, albeit with a projected IC50 > 200-fold, greater than that of Pcr-400 (Fig. 2A); by comparison, Pcr-ΔN displayed no significant inhibitory activity even at 100 μm (data not shown). These data indicate that the extended N-terminal leash and the α-helical region of the mimetic peptide possess intrinsic inhibitory activity but that amino acid residues within the C-terminal leash are essential for full activity and likely contribute to the stability of peptide binding to its target.TABLE 2Activity and solubility profiles of LHR-mimetic peptidesPeptideSyncytium interference IC50Viral entry IC50Maximum solubilityaMaximum solubility in aqueous solution determined by laser nephelometry.μmμmμmPcr-4000.31 ± 0.010.18 ± 0.01>90.0Pcr-ΔC>50ND11.2Pcr-Δ827.71 ± 0.02∼5.80bThese peptides did not reach maximum inhibition at soluble concentrations of peptide.5.6Pcr-ΔCys0.33 ± 0.01ND>90.0Pcr-Δ30.29 ± 0.01ND>90.0Pcr-Δ50.32 ± 0.01ND22.5Pcr-Δ70.28 ± 0.010.19 ± 0.0122.5Pcr-R416A16.31 ± 1.691.55 ± 0.0845.0Pcr-R422A>50∼8.50bThese peptides did not reach maximum inhibition at soluble concentrations of peptide.45.0Pcr-P417G0.30 ± 0.01ND>90.0Pcr-P418G0.33 ± 0.01ND>90.0Pcr-F402A0.29 ± 0.01ND>90.0C34N/AN/A>90.0a Maximum solubility in aqueous solution determined by laser nephelometry.b These peptides did not reach maximum inhibition at soluble concentrations of peptide. Open table in a new tab In an effort to design a minimal peptide that retains inhibitory potency, a short peptide that lacks residues at both the N and C terminus was synthesized. Toward the N terminus Ile-405 makes a significant contribution to the binding of Pcr-400 to a recombinant HTLV-1 coiled coil and is also required for optimum inhibitory activity (21Mirsaliotis A. Lamb D. Brighty D.W. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 4965-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Moreover, examination of the structure for the HTLV-1 trimer-of-hairpins indicates that the side chains of His-409 and Asn-407 participate in hydrogen bonding of the LHR to the coiled coil. We reasoned that loss of these interactions would significantly reduce inhibitory activity. Therefore, only three amino acids from the N-terminal end of the original peptide were omitted from the truncated peptide, thereby removing two cysteines and a phenylalanine. There is no structural information after Asn-421 of the HTLV-1 trimer-of-hairpins (18Kobe B. Center R.J. Kemp B.E. Poumbourios P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4319-4324Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Consequently, it is not possible to predict with confidence how truncations from the C-terminal end will affect binding of the peptide to the coiled coil. However, of the amino acids after Asn-421, only Leu-424 has been shown to contribute to inhibitory activity (21Mirsaliotis A. Lamb D. Brighty D.W. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 4965-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Therefore, all five residues after Leu-424 were omitted from the abridged peptide. The derived peptide, designated Pcr-Δ8 (Table 1), was then tested for inhibition of envelope-mediated membrane fusion in syncytium interference assays. Given that all residues known to be important for inhibitory activity were retained, it was surprising that, although more potent than Pcr-ΔC, Pcr-Δ8 with an estimated IC50 of 30 μm displayed a dramatic drop in potency (Fig. 2A) and solubility (Table 2) relative to Pcr-400, which has an IC50 of 0.3 μm (Table 2). However, Pcr-Δ8 was less soluble in tissue culture medium than the parental peptide and began to precipitate out of solution at concentrations above ∼30 μm. Examining the ability of Pcr-Δ8 to bind to an immobilized coiled coil showed that it is able to compete with a biotinylated version of the parental peptide, Bio-Pcr-400, more effectively than Pcr-ΔC (Fig. 2B). However, in the buffer used in the binding assay, Pcr-Δ8 started to precipitate at concentrations above 27 μm (Table 2). The N-terminal Residue of Pcr-400 Is Dispensable for Inhibitory Activity-In view of the poor activity and solubility of Pcr-Δ8, we sought to identify residues that were critical to activity and solubility. We have demonstrated that the cysteine residues are not essential to the inhibitory properties of the peptides as a peptide with both N-terminal cysteine residues substituted with alanine retains full potency (21Mirsaliotis A. Lamb D. Brighty D.W. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 4965-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). By contrast, removal of the first two cysteines and the phenylalanine from the N terminus of a similar peptide inhibitor of bovine leukemia virus envelope-catalyzed membrane fusion has a significantly detrimental effect on the ability of the bovine leukemia virus-derived peptide to inhibit (19Lamb D. Schuttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M. Brighty D.W. Retrovirology. 2008; 5: 70Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).

This program included the establishment of a preoutbreak national team that could be revaccinated against smallpox.To identify demographic and clinical factors associated with vaccination success defined as the presence of a pustule at the inoculation site at day 8 (days 7-9), with an undiluted vaccinia virus derived from a Lister strain among preimmunized volunteers.From March 2003 to November 2006, we have studied prospectively 226 eligible volunteers. Demographic data were recorded for each volunteer (age, sex, number of previously smallpox vaccinations and date of the last vaccination). Smallpox vaccine adverse reactions were diagnosed on the basis of clinical examination performed at days 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 after revaccination.A total of 226 volunteers (sex ratio H/F = 2.7) were revaccinated. Median age was 45 years (range: 27-63 yrs). All volunteers completed follow-up. Median number of vaccinations before revaccination was 2 (range: 1-8). The median delay between time of the study and the last vaccination was 29 years (range; 18-60 yrs). Sixty-one volunteers (27%) experienced one (n = 40) or more (n = 21) minor side effects during the 2-14 days after revaccination. Successful vaccination was noted in 216/226 volunteers (95.6%) at day 8 and the median of the pustule diameter was 5 mm (range: 1-20 mm). Size of the pustule at day 8 was correlated with age (p = 0.03) and with the presence of axillary adenopathy after revaccination (p = 0.007). Sex, number of prior vaccinations, delay between the last vaccination and revaccination, and local or systemic side effects with the exception of axillary adenopathy, were not correlated with the size of the pustule at day 8.Previously vaccinated volunteers can be successfully revaccinated with the Lister strain."
