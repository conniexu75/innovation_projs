https://openalex.org/W2094963548,"Many potential applications have been proposed for carbon nanotubes, including conductive and high-strength composites; energy storage and energy conversion devices; sensors; field emission displays and radiation sources; hydrogen storage media; and nanometer-sized semiconductor devices, probes, and interconnects. Some of these applications are now realized in products. Others are demonstrated in early to advanced devices, and one, hydrogen storage, is clouded by controversy. Nanotube cost, polydispersity in nanotube type, and limitations in processing and assembly methods are important barriers for some applications of single-walled nanotubes."
https://openalex.org/W2088842558,"We studied a large sample of male children from birth to adulthood to determine why some children who are maltreated grow up to develop antisocial behavior, whereas others do not. A functional polymorphism in the gene encoding the neurotransmitter-metabolizing enzyme monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) was found to moderate the effect of maltreatment. Maltreated children with a genotype conferring high levels of MAOA expression were less likely to develop antisocial problems. These findings may partly explain why not all victims of maltreatment grow up to victimize others, and they provide epidemiological evidence that genotypes can moderate children's sensitivity to environmental insults."
https://openalex.org/W2168272960,"In the adult brain, new neurons are continuously generated in the subventricular zone and dentate gyrus, but it is unknown whether these neurons can replace those lost following damage or disease. Here we show that stroke, caused by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in adult rats, leads to a marked increase of cell proliferation in the subventricular zone. Stroke-generated new neurons, as well as neuroblasts probably already formed before the insult, migrate into the severely damaged area of the striatum, where they express markers of developing and mature, striatal medium-sized spiny neurons. Thus, stroke induces differentiation of new neurons into the phenotype of most of the neurons destroyed by the ischemic lesion. Here we show that the adult brain has the capacity for self-repair after insults causing extensive neuronal death. If the new neurons are functional and their formation can be stimulated, a novel therapeutic strategy might be developed for stroke in humans."

Extraordinary progress has been made in the development of practical processes and products from polymers such as starch, cellulose, and lactic acid. The need to create alternative biodegradable water-soluble polymers for down-the-drain products such as detergents and cosmetics has taken on increasing importance. Consumers have, however, thus far attached little or no added value to the property of biodegradability, forcing industry to compete head-to-head on a cost-performance basis with existing familiar products. In addition, no suitable infrastructure for the disposal of biodegradable materials exists as yet."
https://openalex.org/W2088313145,"Many object-related actions can be recognized by their sound. We found neurons in monkey premotor cortex that discharge when the animal performs a specific action and when it hears the related sound. Most of the neurons also discharge when the monkey observes the same action. These audiovisual mirror neurons code actions independently of whether these actions are performed, heard, or seen. This discovery in the monkey homolog of Broca's area might shed light on the origin of language: audiovisual mirror neurons code abstract contents—the meaning of actions—and have the auditory access typical of human language to these contents."

https://openalex.org/W2114514252,"Solvents are widely used in commercial manufacturing and service industries. Despite abundant precaution, they inevitably contaminate our air, land, and water because they are difficult to contain and recycle. Researchers have therefore focused on reducing solvent use through the development of solvent-free processes and more efficient recycling protocols. However, these approaches have their limitations, necessitating a pollution prevention approach and the search for environmentally benign solvent alternatives. This report highlights opportunities for the practical implementation of such green solvents."

https://openalex.org/W1976555898,"Excessive caloric intake is thought to be sensed by the brain, which then activates thermogenesis as a means of preventing obesity. The sympathetic nervous system, through β-adrenergic receptor (βAR) action on target tissues, is likely the efferent arm of this homeostatic mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we created mice that lack the three known βARs (β-less mice). β-less mice on a Chow diet had a reduced metabolic rate and were slightly obese. On a high-fat diet, β-less mice, in contrast to wild-type mice, developed massive obesity that was due entirely to a failure of diet-induced thermogenesis. These findings establish that βARs are necessary for diet-induced thermogenesis and that this efferent pathway plays a critical role in the body's defense against diet-induced obesity."

However, current assays for gene expression destroy the structural context. By combining advances in computational fluorescence microscopy with multiplex probe design, we devised technology in which the expression of many genes can be visualized simultaneously inside single cells with high spatial and temporal resolution. Analysis of 11 genes in serum-stimulated cultured cells revealed unique patterns of gene expression within individual cells. Using the nucleus as the substrate for parallel gene analysis, we provide a platform for the fusion of genomics and cell biology: ""cellular genomics."""

https://openalex.org/W1967673384,"E-cadherin protein plays a key role in the establishment and maintenance of adherent junctions. Recent evidence implicates the transcription factor Snail in the blockage of E-cadherin expression in fibroblasts and some epithelial tumor cells through direct binding to three E-boxes in the E-cadherin promoter. Transfection of Snail into epithelial cells leads to a more fibroblastic phenotype. Cells expressing Snail presented a scattered flattened phenotype with low intercellular contacts. Other epithelial markers like Cytokeratin 18 or MUC1 were also repressed. The effects of Snail on MUC1 transcription were mediated by two E-boxes present in the proximal promoter. Snail also induced expression of the mesenchymal markers fibronectin and LEF1 and the transcription repressor ZEB1. ZEB1 and Snail had a similar pattern of expression in epithelial cell lines, and both were induced by overexpression of ILK1, a kinase that causes the loss of E-cadherin and the acquisition of a fibroblastic phenotype. Snail overexpression in several cell lines raised ZEB1 RNA levels and increased the activity of ZEB1 promoter. ZEB1 could also repress E-cadherin and MUC1 promoters but less strongly than Snail. However, since ZEB1 expression persisted after Snail was down-regulated, ZEB1 may regulate epithelial genes in several tumor cell lines.

This morphological transformation is often referred to as epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT).1 EMT was first described in development when it is closely regulated and associated with processes like gastrulation or neuroepithelium formation. Molecular events during EMT include alterations in cell-cell adhesion, cell-substrate interaction, extracellular matrix degradation, and cytoskeleton organization. During EMT, epithelial markers are down-regulated, among them E-cadherin, a protein essential for the establishment of cell-cell adhesion (for review, see Refs. 1Hay E.D. Acta Anat. (Basel). 1995; 154: 8-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar, 2Boyer B. Vallés A.M. Edme N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1091-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 3Savagner P. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 912-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). In cancerous cells there is a high correlation between invasion and metastasis and the loss of E-cadherin (4Vleminckx K. Vakaet Jr., L. Mareel M. Fiers W. van Roy F. Cell. 1991; 66: 107-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar, 5Perl A.K. Wilgenbus P. Dahl U. Semb H. Christofori G.A. Nature. 1998; 392: 190-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar), whereas during gastrulation E-cadherin is down-regulated in progenitor cells in the primitive streak (6Oda H. Tsukita S. Takeichi M. Dev. Biol. 1998; 203: 435-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Control of E-cadherin transcription is the main mechanism responsible for the down-regulation of this protein (7Hennig G. Lowrick O. Birchmeier W. Behrens J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 595-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 8Ji X. Woodard A.S. Rimm D.L. Fearon E.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 773-778PubMed Google Scholar). A transcriptional factor called Snail (SNA in humans and Sna in mice) represses E-cadherin transcription in vitro and in vivo by binding to a 5′-CACCTG-3′ sequence of the E-cadherin promoter (9Batlle E. Sancho E. Francı́ C. Domı́nguez D. Monfar M. Baulida J. Garcı́a de Herreros A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). Transfection of Snail in epithelial cells decreases E-cadherin levels and induces changes resembling EMT (9Batlle E. Sancho E. Francı́ C. Domı́nguez D. Monfar M. Baulida J. Garcı́a de Herreros A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar, 10Cano A. Pérez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A. Blanco M.J. del Barrio M.G. Portillo F. Nieto M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar). In addition, Snail is believed to contribute to the EMT in several experimental models. For instance, during Drosophilagastrulation, Snail function is required for the repression in the mesoderm of genes that are otherwise expressed in the adjacent neuroectodermal regions of the blastoderm (11Casal J. Leptin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10327-10332Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Further evidence was obtained from Sna −/− mouse embryos, which show an incomplete EMT: a new mesoderm is formed, but the resulting cells maintain epithelial markers like E-cadherin (12Carver E.A. Jiang R. Lan Y. Oram K.F. Gridley T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8184-8188Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Other mutants that show defects in EMT and cell migration during gastrulation are fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (−/−) animals; these defects have been attributed to a severe reduction of Snail expression in the primitive streak accompanied by ectopic expression of E-cadherin (13Ciruna B. Rossant J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 37-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Several conditions also induce EMT in epithelial cell lines (3Savagner P. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 912-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Snail is involved in a number of processes: for instance, activation of integrin-linked kinase (ILK), which mediates extracellular matrix signals (14Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 15Dedhar S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), increases Snail promoter activity and down-regulates E-cadherin (16Tan C. Costello P. Sanghera J. Domı́nguez D. Baulida J. Garcı́a de Herreros A. Dedhar S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Finally, increased Snail expression has been described in some carcinogenic cell lines with invasive capacity (10Cano A. Pérez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A. Blanco M.J. del Barrio M.G. Portillo F. Nieto M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar, 17Poser I. Dominguez D. Garcia de Herreros A. Varnai A. Buettner R. Bosserhoff A.K. J. Biol.

In this study we have examined with greater detail the changes induced by the ectopic expression of Sna in epithelial cells. In addition to showing the ultrastructural modifications observed in cells expressing Sna, we have also characterized several genes that show an altered expression. One of these genes isZEB1, 2In this study we use the name ZEB1 to refer to the gene that has also been called ZEB,AREB6 (in humans), BZP (in hamster), or δEF1 (in chicken) (GenBankTM accession numberU12170) and ZEB2 for the gene also known as SIP1(GenBankTM accession numberAB011141). a transcriptional repressor also capable of blocking the expression of E-cadherin. The data obtained together with data previously reported clearly show that Snail induces a complete EMT. The generation of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and HT-29 M6 cells transfected with Sna-HA has been described (9Batlle E. Sancho E. Francı́ C. Domı́nguez D. Monfar M. Baulida J. Garcı́a de Herreros A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). HT-29 M6 SNA1 and SNA2 correspond to two clones obtained by transfection with a tet-regulated expression vector (tet-off) containing hemagglutinin-tagged mouse Snail cDNA (Sna). MDCK SNA1 and SNA3 are two MDCK Sna-expressing clones obtained by transfection of MDCK cells with pIRES-neo Sna-HA (9Batlle E. Sancho E. Francı́ C. Domı́nguez D. Monfar M. Baulida J. Garcı́a de Herreros A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). IEC-18 rat cells transfected with wild-type or negative forms of ILK or with an antisense construction of this kinase were obtained as described previously (14Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Other human (HT-29, SW-480, SW-620, ZR-75, T47D, MCF-7, MiaPaca, and RWP-1) or mouse (EpH4 and NIH-3T3) cell lines were obtained from our institute Cell Bank. All cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Biological Industries) and the standard supplements. Murine ZEB1cDNA was provided by T. Genetta (Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA) and cloned into pcDNA3HisC expression vector (Promega) at the EcoRI site.ZEB2-CS2MT expression vector was kindly provided by A. Postigo (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). Sna-HA was cloned into RSV 5 expression vector inserting the 0.9-kbHindIII-NotI fragment from pcDNA3Sna-HA at the XhoI site of RSV 5. Blunt ends were generated using the Klenow fragment from DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). Commercial anti-ZEB1 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (goat anti-ZEB1 C-20, sc-10570) and monoclonal anti-E-cadherin from Transduction Laboratories (c20820). Antiserum against recombinant mouse Snail was raised in New Zealand rabbits by standard protocols and purified by affinity chromatography using recombinant murine Snail. Postconfluent cells were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde for 30 min and embedded in EPON (Tousimis Research Corp., Rockville, MD). Semithin and ultrathin sections were obtained and stained using standard procedures. For electron microscopy, ultrathin sections were observed using a Philips CM100 electron microscope. Northern blots were performed following a standard protocol. Briefly, 12.5 μg of total RNA isolated by guanidinium isothiocyanate extraction were separated in a denaturing agarose/formaldehyde gel, visualized with ethidium bromide staining, photographed, and transferred to a Zeta-probe (Bio-Rad) membrane overnight by capillarity action. The next day RNA was cross-linked to the membrane using a GS Gene linker (Bio-Rad) and hybridized with radiolabeled [α-32P]dCTP probes (rediprime II, Amersham Biosciences) using ExpressHyb solution (CLONTECH). MUC1 DNA probe was prepared from 50 ng of purified MUC1 cDNA cytosolic sequence, amplified by reverse transcription coupled to polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from HT-29 M6 total RNA using the oligonucleotides 5′-CGAAAGCTTGCCGCCGAAAGAACTACG-3′ (sense, 556–574) and 5′-GAGGATATCGCAAGTTGGCAGAAGTGGC-3′ (antisense, 748–765) corresponding to a sequence stored in the GenBankTM(accession number X80671). Specific bands were visualized by autoradiography using Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Biosciences). RT-PCR analysis from 0.5–1 μg of isolated total RNA was performed using SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR with Platinum Taqpolymerase (Invitrogen). The following pairs of primers (sense/antisense) were used: hsZEB1, 5′-TTCAGCATCACCAGGCAGTC-3′ (947–966)/5′-GAGTGGAGGAGGCTGAGTAG-3′ (1663–1683); hsZEB2, 5′-GCTACGACCATACCCAGGAC-3′ (2756–2776)/5′-TCTCGCCCGAGTGAAGCC-3′ (3139–3157); Sna, 5′-GGCGGATCCACCATGCCGCGCTCCTTCCTGGTC-3′ (1–24)/5′-CCGGATATCCGCGAGGGCCTCCGGAGCA-3′ (778–791); SNA, 5′-TTCCAGCAGCCCTACGACCAG-3′ (104–125)/5′-GCCTTTCCCACTGTCCTCATC-3′ (290–310); hs Cyclophilin A: 5′-ATGGTCAACCCCACCGTG-3′ (45–62)/5′-TGCAATCCAGCTAGGCATG-3′ (690–708); hs Fibronectin, 5′-GTGCCTGGGCAACGGA-3′ (922–938)/5′-CCCGACCCTGACCGAAG-3′ (1554–1571); hs Cytokeratin 18, 5′-CTGGAGACCGAGAACCGGA-3′ (352–370)/5′-tccgagccagctcgtcaT-3′ (818–835); hsMUC1, 5′-catgGTACCGCAAGGCTCCCGGTGACC-3′ (556–574)/5′-CGTAAGCTTGGGAGGGGGCAGAACAGATT-3′ (748–765); hs E-cadherin, 5′-TTCCTCCCAATACATCTCCCTTCACAGCAG-3′ (1977–2006)/5′-CGAAGAAACAGCAAGAGCAGCAGAATCAGA-3′ (2287–2316); and hsLEF1, 5′-CTGCGCCACGGACGAG-3′ (704–720)/5′-GAGAGGATGGACCGCATGG-3′ (1098–1116). The sense and antisense primers anneal with different exons. The number of cycles and annealing temperatures were: ZEB1, 40 at 53 °C;ZEB2, 28 at 55 °C; SNA, 32 at 60 °C;Sna, 39 at 60 °C; hsMUC1, 30 at 60 °C; hs E-cadherin, 29 at 55 °C; hs Fibronectin, 30 at 55 °C; hsLEF1, 35 at 55 °C; hs Cytokeratin 18, 40 at 55 °C; and hs Cyclophilin A, 22 at 60 °C. The sequences indicated correspond to those stored in the GenBankTM under the following accession numbers: hsZEB1, U12170; hsZEB2, AB011141; SNA, NM005985; Sna,M95604; hsMUC1, X80671; hs E-cadherin, AB025106; hs Fibronectin, X02761; hsLEF1, AF288571; hs Cytokeratin 18,M26326; and hs Cyclophilin A, BC005320. The humanMUC1 promoter sequence containing −756 to +49 bp from the transcription start site was cloned by PCR from HT-29 genomic DNA using high fidelity Taq polymerase (Pfx, Invitrogen) and oligonucleotides 5′-catgGTACCGCAAGGCTCCCGGTGACC-3′ (2114–2133) and 5′-CGTAAGCTTGGGAGGGGGCAGAACAGATT-3′ (2900–2919) corresponding to GenBankTM sequence X69118 containing KpnI andHindIII restriction sites at the ends. Purified PCR product was cloned into the KpnI and HindIII sites of a mutated version (9Batlle E. Sancho E. Francı́ C. Domı́nguez D. Monfar M. Baulida J. Garcı́a de Herreros A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar) of pGL3 Luciferase vector (Promega) (a putative Snail binding site of the plasmid was eliminated). A MUC1promoter mutant in the two E-boxes, E-MUC (MUT), was obtained using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The sense oligonucleotide sequence was 5′-GAGGGGGCGGGGTTTTGTAAACCTATAACCTACTCGCTGTGCCTAGGGCCG-3′, where mutated nucleotides are indicated in bold. Human ZEB1 promoter (−361 to −53 from the translation start) was amplified from the same source using oligonucleotides 5′-CCGCCGAGCCTCCAACTTTA-3′ (3119980–3119998) and 5′-CCTTCCCCCCCACCCCTCC-3′ (3120269–3120287) corresponding to NCBI contig number NT_033982, containing MluI andHindIII sites at the 5′-ends, respectively. The fragment was cloned into the mutated version of pGL3 at the MluI andHindIII sites. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Repression of E-cadherin orMUC1 promoter activity was measured by cotransfectingZEB or Sna constructions in pcDNA3 plasmid (Invitrogen) with pGL3-E-cadherin or -MUC1 promoters in the indicated cell lines. Cotransfections included a Renilla reniformis luciferase plasmid (pRTK-Luc or pRSV-Luc from Promega) to normalize transfection efficiency. Firefly luciferase (Luc) and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) 48 h after transfection according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luc activity was normalized by Renillaluciferase activity. In all experiments, the total amount of DNA transfected was standardized with empty vector. Duplicates or triplicates were systematically included, and experiments were repeated at least three times. ZEB1 or MUC1 promoter activity in Sna clones was assayed by cotransfecting varying amounts of pGL3-ZEB1 or -MUC1 promoter reporter and pRTK-Luc and measuring luciferase activity as mentioned above. Cells were seeded on 1-cm-diameter cover glasses, left to grow to 40–70% confluence, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, blocked with 5% milk in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with specific antibodies. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-goat or anti-rabbit (DAKO) was used as second antibody. Immunofluorescent labeled cells were observed in a fluorescent microscope (Axioskop). Alternatively, protein expression was determined by Western blot using 15 μg of lysates obtained by boiling the cells in 1% SDS. The fibroblastoid morphology of several of the Sna-transfected HT-29 M6 and MDCK cell clones used in this work is shown in Fig.1. The main attribute of these cells is the failure to form compacted colonies and a more scattered aspect. In HT-29 M6 clones transfected with the tet-off system, the epithelial phenotype was restored by addition of the tetracycline analogue doxycycline, which prevents expression of Snail (Fig. 1 and Ref. 9Batlle E. Sancho E. Francı́ C. Domı́nguez D. Monfar M. Baulida J. Garcı́a de Herreros A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). Lateral sections obtained from HT-29 M6 clones illustrate that Snail overexpression prevented the formation of the compact columnar epithelial-like monolayer characteristic of HT-29 M6 cells and reduced the thickness from 12–16 to 4–6 μm (Fig.2, left panels). HT-29 M6 SNA1 clone, like the other Sna-expressing clones, showed a flattened, fibroblast-like phenotype with cells disposed occasionally on the top of others. No cell contacts were observed in these transfectants in contrast to control HT-29 M6 clones where tight junctions, adherens junctions, and desmosomes were seen (Fig. 2, right panels). These control clones also showed closer apposition of lateral membranes and other characteristics of well differentiated epithelial cells like microvilli and mucus droplets. Some cell properties were also altered in the Sna transfectants, compatible with the transition from an epithelial to a mesenchymal phenotype. In addition to a decrease in intercellular adhesion (Figs. 1and 2, and data not shown), Sna-expressing clones attached better to plastic and spread faster on several matrices such as collagen or laminin (data not shown). Increases in these two parameters are observed in fibroblasts with respect to well differentiated epithelial cells like HT-29 M6. HT-29 M6 Sna clones treated with doxycycline were indistinguishable from controls (not shown). We also determined whether these changes in phenotype were accompanied by alterations in the expression of different genes. Using a semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis, we found RNA levels of several epithelial genes, other than E-cadherin, to be decreased in Sna-transfected clones of HT-29 M6 cells (Fig.3). Expression of MUC1 and Cytokeratin 18, which contain putative Snail-binding sequences in their promoters (see below), decreased in Sna-transfected clones. On the other hand, Fibronectin, LEF1, and ZEB1 were up-regulated in Sna transfectants. Increased levels of Fibronectin have already been reported in MDCK cells transfected with Snail (10Cano A. Pérez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A. Blanco M.J. del Barrio M.G. Portillo F. Nieto M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar); the augmentation in the synthesis of this protein might be responsible for the higher rate of attachment and spreading of Sna clones. ZEB1 and LEF1 are two transcription factors related to mesenchymal phenotypes. LEF1 is the preferential LEF/T cell factor isoform in mesenchymal cells and is differentially expressed in some neoplastic processes such as colon cancers (20Hovanes K., Li, T.W. Munguia J.E. Truong T. Milovanovic T. Lawrence-Marsh J. Holcombe R.F. Waterman M.L. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 53-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, ZEB1 is a transcriptional factor recently described to be involved in E-cadherin repression (21Grooteclaes M.L. Frisch S.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3823-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). To investigate the changes in gene expression that accompany this epithelial to mesenchymal transition we decided to analyze in greater detail the modulation of two representative genes: one, MUC1, that is repressed, and another one, ZEB1, that is activated. MUC1 is a marker of several epithelial tissues including the colonic epithelium. Its promoter sequence contains a tandem repeat of the consensus Snail DNA binding sequence situated at −84 bp from the transcription start (22Kovarik A. Peat N. Wilson D. Gendler S.J. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9917-9926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, like E-cadherin, this gene is a putative direct target of Snail. Northern blots corroborated thatMUC1 RNA levels were significantly lower in Sna-expressing HT-29 M6 clones than in controls (Fig.4 A). Then we analyzed whether the Snail-induced decrease of MUC1 RNA was a consequence of a repression of the activity of the promoter. An 800-bp MUC1gene fragment, corresponding to sequence containing −756 to +49 with respect to the transcription start (22Kovarik A. Peat N. Wilson D. Gendler S.J. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9917-9926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was cloned and inserted into the pGL3 plasmid upstream of the luciferase reporter gene. This promoter has been described to be active in epithelial cell lines expressing MUC1 (22Kovarik A. Peat N. Wilson D. Gendler S.J. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9917-9926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MUC1 transcriptional activity was lower in the Sna transfectant clones than in control or parental cells (Fig. 4 B). The Snail-induced repression of theMUC1 promoter was reproduced when Snail was transiently transfected in HT-29 M6 parental cells or other MUC1-expressing epithelial cells. In all cases, Snail repressed the activity of the promoter in a dose-dependent manner by up to 80% (Fig.4 C). This repression was not observed with the Sna mutant Pro-2 → Ala (data not shown), which does not block E-cadherin promoter activity (9Batlle E. Sancho E. Francı́ C. Domı́nguez D. Monfar M. Baulida J. Garcı́a de Herreros A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). Modification of the putative Snail-binding element in the promoter (mutation of 5′-cacctgtcacctg-3′ to 5′-aacctataaccta-3′) prevented the decrease in MUC1 promoter activity (Fig.4 C). A similar mutation has been reported to inhibit binding of Snail to E-cadherin promoter E-boxes and repression of this promoter (9Batlle E. Sancho E. Francı́ C. Domı́nguez D. Monfar M. Baulida J. Garcı́a de Herreros A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). Therefore, the presence of a Snail binding sequence is required to block MUC1 transcription. These results demonstrate that Snail represses directly the expression of at least another epithelial marker in addition to E-cadherin. The induction of ZEB1 expression was also investigated. As mentioned above, ZEB1 is also a transcriptional repressor capable, like Snail, of preventing the activity of the E-cadherin promoter. First, the expression of these three genes (SNA/Sna, ZEB1, and E-cadherin) was analyzed in a collection of epithelial cell lines expressing variable amounts of E-cadherin. Because of the low amounts of transcription factor RNAs present in a total RNA preparation, we used RT-PCR to detect Sna and ZEB1. Only in those cell lines in which Snail and ZEB1 were coexpressed was E-cadherin severely down-regulated (Fig. 5,upper panels). In a few cell lines, like EpH4, we detected simultaneous expression of both E-cadherin and Snail but not ZEB1. We also analyzed whether the expression of Snail is induced in conditions in which cells undergo EMT. We used as a model IEC-18 epithelial cells that undergo EMT when transfected with ILK(14Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). When an active ILK was expressed, IEC-18 cells acquired a fibroblastoid phenotype that correlated with a down-regulation of E-cadherin. Although Snail was detected in these cells, overexpression of ILK induced an increase in the RNA corresponding to this gene. We found that the active ILK form also induced ZEB1 RNA (Fig.5, lower panels). Therefore, ZEB1 seems to be induced concomitantly with Snail and the acquisition of the fibroblastoid phenotype in IEC-18 cells. The involvement of Snail in ZEB1 activation was evidenced by our data with Sna transfectants. As mentioned above (see Fig. 3), in our Sna-expressing HT-29 M6 clones ZEB1 RNA levels were increased. A more detailed study was performed in these clones taking advantage of the regulation of the expression of this gene by the tetracycline analogue doxycycline. ZEB1 RNA transcription was detected only after Snail RNA expression was turned on by withdrawing doxycycline from the medium (Fig.6). Expression of Sna was detected 4 days after withdrawing doxycycline, slightly precedingZEB1 expression, which required 8 days. Therefore Sna expression is sufficient to trigger the ZEB1 RNA up-regulation. On the other hand, when Sna expression was turned off by adding doxycycline, ZEB1 RNA did not disappear immediately, as did Sna, but diminished gradually. The stability of ZEB1 RNA in the absence of Snail suggests that ZEB1 could possibly prolong the repression of epithelial genes initiated by Snail. This result seems not to be exclusive of these HT-29 M6 clones since MDCK Sna-transfected clones also showed increased levels ofZEB1 RNA (Fig. 7 A). The molecular mechanism by which Snail induces ZEB1 was studied. To test whether Snail induces the transcription ofZEB1, we cloned a 308-bp DNA fragment upstream of theZEB1 first exon and assayed its promoter activity in MDCK control and Sna-expressing cells. Sna-expressing MDCK clones contained 2.5-fold higher activity than controls of this promoter (Fig.7 B), indicating that Snail increases ZEB1 RNA at least in part by the activation of the transcription of this gene. To validate this result we tested the reporter activity in transient transfection of Snail. In RWP-1 cells Snail also increased the transcriptional activity of the ZEB1 reporter; however, this effect was only observed when the activity was determined in cells transfected longer than 48 h (Fig. 7 C). The ZEB1 homologue, ZEB2, has also been described to behave as an E-cadherin repressor (23Comijn J. Berx G. Vermassen P. Verschueren K. van Grunsven L. Bruyneel E. Mareel M. Huylebroeck D. van Roy F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1267-1278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). However, it did not respond to Snail activation in any of our experiments, and its expression did not correlate with that of Snail in the epithelial cell lines tested; it was detected in all the cell lines analyzed (Figs. 5 and7 A). As the first step to confirm the putative role of ZEB1 as a repressor in the Snail activated pathway, we confirmed that ZEB1 protein was also up-regulated in Sna-transfected clones. A clear increase of this protein was detected in the nucleus in HT-29 M6 and MDCK clones (Fig.8). We also analyzed the repression activity of ZEB1 on E-cadherin promoter transcription in several epithelial cell lines using a proximal E-cadherin promoter (−178 to +23) upstream of a luciferase gene reporter. This promoter sequence contains three 5′-CACCTG-3′ boxes where Snail and ZEB1 can bind. ZEB1 repressed the promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner with a maximal inhibition of 60–80% in the cell lines tested, which included RWP-1 (Fig. 9 A), MCF-7 (Fig. 9 B), HT-29 M6, and MDCK (data not shown). The degree of repression obtained with ZEB1 and Snail were comparable; however, although both were expressed under the same promoter, ZEB1 required a 10–20-fold higher dose to achieve the maximum repression in the four cell lines assayed. This effect on the E-cadherin promoter was accompanied by changes in the expression of this protein (not shown). Thus, ZEB1 also holds the potential to repress E-cadherin transcription, although less effectively than Snail. On the other hand, ZEB2 repressed the promoter poorly with a maximum of 40% in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 9 B). No synergistic effects were observed in experiments of simultaneous repression of Sna and ZEB1 on E-cadherin promoter; inhibitions of the activity of this promoter by both factors are additive (Fig. 9 A).Figure 9Epithelial repression activity of ZEB1 and Snail. Cells were cotransfected with 250 ng of pGL3-E-cadherin promoter (A and B) or pGL3-MUC1promoter (C), 5 ng of pRLSV-Luc, and the indicated amounts of Sna, ZEB1, orZEB2 in pcDNA3. In all experiments luciferase activity was assayed 48 h after transfection and normalized taking into account the value obtained with Renilla luciferase. Results show the average ± range of three to four experiments performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We also tested whether ZEB1 repressed another Snail target gene,MUC1. Reporter assays using the above-describedMUC1 promoter show that, in a fashion similar to Snail, ZEB1 repressed the promoter activity (Fig. 9 C). Similar to the results obtained with E-cadherin promoter, ZEB1 was at least 10-fold less potent than Snail as a repressor of the MUC1promoter. In certain circumstances epithelial cells can undergo extensive changes in their phenotype and convert to mesenchymal cells. This EMT is observed in several phases of embryonic development and in carcinoma cell invasion and metastasis. Transcription of E-cadherin gene is down-regulated during these processes (4Vleminckx K. Vakaet Jr., L. Mareel M. Fiers W. van Roy F. Cell. 1991; 66: 107-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar, 5Perl A.K. Wilgenbus P. Dahl U. Semb H. Christofori G.A. Nature. 1998; 392: 190-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). However, EMT involves a decrease of a set of epithelial tissue-specific molecules or markers other than E-cadherin and an increase of mesenchyme-related molecules (1Hay E.D. Acta Anat. (Basel). 1995; 154: 8-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar). We (9Batlle E. Sancho E. Francı́ C. Domı́nguez D. Monfar M. Baulida J. Garcı́a de Herreros A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar) and others (10Cano A. Pérez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A. Blanco M.J. del Barrio M.G. Portillo F. Nieto M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar) have reported that the transcriptional repressor Snail blocks E-cadherin expression by binding to specific E-boxes in its promoter, but the mechanism by which levels of other molecules are regulated in EMT is poorly understood. Genetic approaches in Drosophila have showed that two transcription factors, Snail and Twist, regulate the expression of mesenchymal and epithelial genes, although some mesenchymal genes can also be regulated by other transcriptional genes like Dorsal and Tailless (11Casal J. Leptin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10327-10332Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Developmental studies (for review, see Ref. 24Nieto M.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar) as well as data obtained after transfection to epithelial cells indicate that Sna induces a complete EMT when transfected to cultured epithelial cells. We took advantage of this capacity of Sna to study the mechanisms of repression of epithelial genes or activation of mesenchymal genes. Epithelial genes other than E-cadherin, like MUC1 and Cytokeratin 18, also possess E-boxes on their promoters. Our results show that RNA levels of these genes are decreased after Snail expression (Figs. 3 and 4) and that repression of MUC1 requires intact E-boxes (Fig. 4). Therefore, MUC1 and E-cadherin seem to be regulated by a common mechanism that involves Snail. However, other factors with affinity for this sequence may also participate in the down-regulation of MUC1 and E-cadherin transcription. Among the genes up-regulated by Snail we found a transcriptional repressor, ZEB1, also capable of binding the same E-boxes as Snail. ZEB1 and ZEB2 are homologues ofDrosophila Zfh-1, which is active downstream of Snail in embryonic development. Snail is required for the expression ofZfh-1 in the mesoderm primordium; in Snail mutants,Zfh-1 expression is severely reduced (25Lai Z.C. Fortini M.E. Rubin G.M. Mech. Dev. 1991; 34: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Our results obtained from Sna-inducible and stable clones clearly show that Snail increases ZEB1 RNA (Figs. Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7) and protein levels (Fig. 8) during EMT. We have also shown, through reporter experiments, that ZEB1 augmentation is due, at least in part, to an elevation of the transcriptional activity of the ZEB1 promoter (Fig.9 B). Although the ZEB1 promoter contains E-box sequences, we do not think that Snail directly activatesZEB1 promoter since (a) the time required to observe the increase of the reporter is longer than the time required to repress E-cadherin or MUC1 promoters (compare Figs. 7 C and 9) and (b) ZEB1expression was detected after 4 days of expression of Snail in a Sna-inducible clone (Fig. 6 B). ZEB1, like Snail, represses E-cadherin and MUC1transcription when transfected into epithelial cells. Moreover, tumor cell lines with severe reduction of E-cadherin expressed both Snail and ZEB1 (Fig. 3), and Snail and ZEB1 repression activities were additive (Fig. 9). In addition to the up-regulation of ZEB1 RNA in Snail-induced clones, when Snail expression was switched off,ZEB1 expression required more than 20 days to gradually return to basal levels (Fig. 6). This observation indicates that in circumstances of a transient expression of Snail, ZEB1 prolonged Snail-induced repression of epithelial genes. In agreement with this hypothesis, in Drosophila embryos Zfh-1 persists after Snail is down-regulated (26Leptin M. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1568-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 27Gray S. Levine M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 700-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, whereas Snaknock-out mutant mice are not viable due to defective gastrulation (12Carver E.A. Jiang R. Lan Y. Oram K.F. Gridley T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8184-8188Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), ZEB1 is dispensable for this process.ZEB1 knock-out animals develop to term, although they show severe deficiencies in T cell production in the thymus and several skeletal defects (28Takagi T. Moribe H. Kondoh H. Higashi Y. Development. 1998; 125: 21-31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, Snail, but not ZEB1, is necessary for the E-cadherin down-regulation required for a correct gastrulation. The analysis of tumor cell lines with different epithelial or mesenchymal characteristics as well as IEC-18 intestinal cells expressing ILK showed a high inverse relationship between ZEB1 and E-cadherin expression. This relationship is better than that presented by E-cadherin and Snail since we detected several cell lines expressing these two proteins. However, recent data from our laboratory indicates that the presence of Snail does not always correlate with the activity of this factor since in several cell lines, in those that present concomitant expression of E-cadherin, Snail protein is excluded from the nucleus. 3D. Domı́nguez, B. Montserrat, J. Grueso, M. Porta, A. Virgós, C. Francı́, J. Baulida, and A. Garcı́a de Herreros, manuscript in preparation. These data, together with those obtained with knock-out mice, suggest that Snail is the key element controlling E-cadherin transcription and triggering EMT and, therefore, ZEB1 expression in most of epithelial cell lines. However, in some tumors, ZEB1 might become unresponsive to Snail activation as a result of mutations in the promoter or the activation of some of its transcriptional activators and might block E-cadherin expression. All cell lines tested showed expression of ZEB2independently of Snail and E-cadherin levels. This expression ofZEB2 was not modified either during ILK-induced EMT of IEC-18 cells or after induction of Snail. These observations strongly suggest a different regulation for the expression of the twoZEB homologues: ZEB1 is induced by Snail and is specific to fibroblastic cells, whereas ZEB2 is constitutively expressed in all the cell lines, independently of their epithelial or mesenchymal lineage. Moreover, although ZEB2 induces repression of E-cadherin promoter in some cellular contexts (Ref. 23Comijn J. Berx G. Vermassen P. Verschueren K. van Grunsven L. Bruyneel E. Mareel M. Huylebroeck D. van Roy F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1267-1278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholarand Fig. 9 B), this factor presents much lower activity than ZEB1 or Snail. The difference in the repression of E-cadherin between ZEB1 and ZEB2 may be due to the distinct organization of the regulatory domains (29Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6391-6396Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In any case, our results indicate that the endogenous amount of ZEB2 cannot repress the activity of basal epithelial promoters in tumor cells. However, due to its ubiquitous expression, the question of whether ZEB2 cooperates with Snail to repress epithelial promoters remains to be answered. We thank Drs. Postigo and Genetta for kindly providing reagents. The technical support of Judit Grueso and M. Carmen Torns is greatly appreciated. We also thank Dr. J. Lloreta for help with electronic microscopy."

The decay in activity was coincident with the conversion of Prx I to a more acidic species as assessed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.

Subsequently, a mammalian homolog of thiol-specific antioxidant/AhpC was purified; and it, together with thiol-specific antioxidant and AhpC, defined a family of peroxidases that now includes six mammalian isoforms (Prx I–VI) and members identified in organisms from each kingdom (3Hofmann B.

All Prx proteins contain a conserved Cys residue, which corresponds to Cys51 in mammalian Prx I, in the N-terminal portion of the molecule (10Chae H.Z. Robison K. Poole L.B. Church G. Storz G.

The Prx enzymes containing two conserved Cys residues are thus called 2-Cys Prx, in comparison with a small number of Prx proteins termed 1-Cys Prx, which contain only one conserved cysteine residue in the N-terminal domain (2Rhee S.G. Kang S.W. Chang T.S. Jeong W. Kim K. International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Life. 2001; 52: 35-41Crossref Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 10Chae H.Z. Robison K. Poole L.B. Church G.

In 2-Cys Prx enzymes, the N-terminal conserved cysteine is oxidized by H2O2 to cysteine-sulfenic acid (Cys51-SOH), which then reacts with Cys172-SH of the other subunit to produce an intermolecular disulfide (1Chae H.Z.

Reduction of the disulfide intermediate of Prx I–IV is specific in that it can be achieved by thioredoxin (Trx), but not by GSH or glutaredoxin (15Kang S.W. Chae H.Z. Seo M.S. Kim K. Baines I.C.

Thus, the reducing equivalents for the peroxidase activity of Prx I–IV are ultimately derived from NADPH via thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) and Trx. Not all Prx enzymes containing both conserved Cys residues are reduced by Trx: the bacterial Prx AhpC is reduced by AhpF, which contains both Trx and TrxR domains (10Chae H.Z. Robison K. Poole L.B.

In the absence of a physiological electron donor, the peroxidase activities of 2-Cys Prx enzymes can be supported by small thiol molecules such as dithiothreitol (DTT) and 2-mercaptoethanol, but not by GSH (1Chae H.Z.

In 1-Cys Prx enzymes, including mammalian Prx VI, the conserved cysteine is also the site of oxidation, but remains in a sulfenic acid state upon oxidation because there is no nearby partner cysteine to form a disulfide bond (18Kang S.W.

The crystal structures of 2-Cys and 1-Cys Prx enzymes reveal that the catalytic cysteine is located in a small pocket formed by the N- and C-terminal domains of the two subunits (19Choi H.J.

The reactive cysteine is thus protected from larger oxidant molecules that contain disulfide linkages. The structures also show that the N-terminal conserved cysteine is surrounded by positively charged amino acid residues, which stabilize the thiolate (Cys-S−) anion. The thiolate anion is more readily oxidized by peroxides than its protonated thiol counterpart (Cys-SH) (28Kim J.R. Yoon H.W. Kwon K.S. Lee S.R. Rhee S.G. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 283: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). This provides the mechanistic basis for the observed sensitivity of the active-site cysteine to oxidation by peroxides. Previously, we reported that Prx purified from yeast is readily inactivated during catalysis (1Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We speculated that such inactivation occurs if the sulfenic acid moiety of the reaction intermediate is further oxidized by H2O2 to cysteinesulfinic acid (Cys-SO2H) before disulfide formation with Cys172 can occur (1Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sulfinic acid cannot be reduced by the Trx or DTT included in the assay mixture. Recently, Mitsumotoet al. (29Mitsumoto A. Takanezawa Y. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nakagawa Y. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) used two-dimensional PAGE to compare proteins in human umbilical vein endothelial cells before and after exposure of the cells to H2O2. In H2O2-treated cells, a number of proteins (including Prx I and Prx II) demonstrated altered migration consistent with decreased pI, suggesting that such oxidative inactivation might also occur in cells. However, these acidic Prx enzymes were not characterized in detail. We have now investigated the mechanism of human Prx I inactivation by H2O2. Here, we demonstrate that the enzyme inactivation and concomitant acidic shift of Prx on two-dimensional gels are due in fact to the conversion of the active-site cysteine to Cys-SO2H. Furthermore, we observed that only those Prx molecules actively engaged in the catalytic cycle are vulnerable to oxidative inactivation. The construction of a bacterial expression vector for human Prx I (pETprxI-WT) has been described (15Kang S.W. Chae H.Z. Seo M.S. Kim K. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6297-6302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Two Prx I mutants in which Cys51 and Cys172 were individually replaced by serine residues (C51S and C172S, respectively) were generated by standard PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis with pETprxI-WT as the template and complementary primers containing a single-base mismatch that converts the codon for Cys to one for Ser. The final mutated PCR products were ligated into the pET vector to generate pETprxI-C51S and pETprxI-C172S.Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) competent cells (Novagen) were transformed with pETprxI-WT, pETprxI-C51S, or pETprxI-C172S; cultured at 37 °C overnight in 100 ml of LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml); and then transferred to 10 liters of fresh LB medium in a Microferm fermentor (New Brunswick Scientific). When the absorbance of the culture at 600 nm reached 0.6–0.8, expression was induced by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at a final concentration of 0.4 mm. After incubation for an additional 3 h, the cells were collected by centrifugation, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C until used. The recombinant proteins were purified as described (30Chae H.Z. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). NADPH oxidation coupled to the reduction of H2O2 was monitored at 30 °C as a decrease inA 340 using a Hewlett-Packard Model 8453 UV-visible spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostable cell holder and a multicell transport. The reaction was initiated by addition of the indicated concentration of Prx I to a 200-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.0), 1 mmEDTA, 0.8 μm TrxR, and the indicated concentrations of H2O2, NADPH, and Trx. HeLa S3 cells were adapted to suspension growth in Spinner minimum essential medium (Quality Biological, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). The cells were grown to a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml and maintained by dilution with fresh complete medium every 4 days. HeLa S3 cells were rinsed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (8 murea, 4% CHAPS, and 40 mm Tris base) by sonication in a sonic bath three to four times for 30 s. After removal of insoluble materials by centrifugation at 14,000 × gfor 30 min, cell lysates were mixed with 10 volumes of rehydration buffer (8 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 0.5% immobilized pH gradient buffer, 20 mm DTT, and 0.005% bromphenol blue) and loaded onto immobilized pH gradient strips (pH 3–10, nonlinear). Isoelectric focusing on an IPGPhor isoelectrofocusing unit (Amersham Biosciences) and preparation (reduction and alkylation) of the immobilized pH gradient strips for the second-dimension SDS-PAGE were carried out according to the procedures recommended by the manufacturer. SDS-PAGE was conducted on 12% gels using an AmershamBiosciences SE600 vertical unit, and the protein spots were visualized by staining with silver nitrate. For immunoblot analyses of Prx enzymes, proteins on two-dimensional gels were transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane, and the membrane was incubated with rabbit antibodies to Prx I. Immune complexes were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences or Pierce). Silver-stained two-dimensional gels were scanned with a Molecular Dynamics SI personal densitometer. Reverse-phase HPLC analyses were performed using an Agilent 1100 HPLC system with a Vydac 218TP54 column (0.47 mm × 25 cm). For protein analysis, injected samples were eluted at 1 ml/min with a 5–35% (v/v) acetonitrile/water gradient containing 0.04% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid over 15 min and with a 35–60% gradient over the next 15 min. Gradients of 5–10% over 10 min, 10–40% over 30 min, and 40–60% over 30 min were used for peptide analysis. A Finnigan MAT LCQ electrospray ion-trap mass spectrometer was used for analysis of Prx I proteins and sequence analysis of Cys51-containing peptides. Dried HPLC fractions dissolved in 75% acetonitrile and 0.1% acetic acid were introduced at 1 μl/min using a syringe pump. Data were collected for positive ions at 300–2000 m/z using the following settings: capillary temperature, 215 °C; maximum ion inject time, 100 ms; full scan target, 9 × 107; and three microscans/full scan. For proteins, ESI-MS spectra were obtained and used to calculate the masses of proteins by deconvolution using Finnigan MAT BioWorks software. For sequence analysis of peptides, once the parent ions were identified, the mass spectrometer was set up to obtain collision-induced dissociation MS/MS spectra of the parent ions. The instrument for MS/MS spectra was configured as follows: capillary temperature, 215 °C; maximum ion inject time, 100 ms; full scan target, 2 × 107; three microscans/full scan; mass window, 2.5; and collision energy, used within a range of 0–50%. Mass spectrometry analysis of the tryptic peptides was performed on a Voyager-STR MALDI-TOF instrument (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) equipped with a nitrogen laser. Samples were dissolved in 50% acetonitrile and 5% formic acid, mixed with 10 mg/ml 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (sinapinic acid; Aldrich) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 70% acetonitrile, and spotted on a sample plate. The spectra were obtained in the positive-ion reflector or linear mode with delayed extraction under standard conditions. Spectra were analyzed using DataExplorer software (PerSeptive Biosystems). Standard peptides were used for calibration of peptides, whereas apomyoglobin and carbonic anhydrase were used as internal standards for mass scale calibration of proteins. The peroxidase activity of human Prx I was monitored by following the decrease inA 340 attributable to the oxidation of NADPH in a reaction mixture containing NADPH, Trx, TrxR, and varying concentrations of H2O2. The initial rate of NADPH oxidation (the slope at t = 0) was independent of H2O2 at saturating concentrations (0.1–1 mm) (K m for H2O2< 20 μm (31Chae H.Z. Kim H.J. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 1999; 45: 101-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar)) (Fig.1 A). However, the rate decreased with time, and the higher the H2O2concentration, the faster the rate of decrease. The H2O2 concentration dependence of this decrease is shown more quantitatively by plotting the rate of NADPH oxidation (the first derivative of the NADPH oxidation curve) versustime (Fig. 1 B). Replenishment of Prx I was shown to restore the enzyme rate, indicating that the markedly decreased NADPH oxidation rate was not attributable to exhaustion of substrate or to product inhibition (data not shown). Reactions containing 200 μmH2O2 were stopped at 0, 60, and 150 s, and the resulting samples were subjected to two-dimensional PAGE analysis. A single spot at a position corresponding to a pI value of 8.1 (the theoretical pI of Prx I is 8.2) was observed at 0 s. At 60 s, however, a new spot whose intensity was similar to that of the original spot appeared at a more acidic position (pI 7.6). At 150 s, the intensity of the acidic spot was enhanced at the expense of the original spot. The increasing proportion of the acidic species compared with the original spot is consistent with the notion that the 50 and 80% decreases in rate observed at 60 and 150 s, respectively, are related to the conversion of Prx I to a more acidic derivative. To identify the modification responsible for the acidic shift, Prx I was oxidized for 5 min in the presence of 1 mm H2O2 and 10 mm DTT. Reduced and oxidized enzymes were separated from the reaction mixture by reverse-phase HPLC (Fig.2 A). The molecular masses of the separated proteins were measured by ESI-MS (Fig. 2 B). The masses calculated fromm/z and total charge of multiply charged ions of the reduced and oxidized enzymes were 21,979 and 22,011 Da, respectively. The mass of the reduced enzyme was in good agreement with the theoretical mass of 21,979.2 Da. The difference of 32 mass units between the reduced and oxidized Prx I enzymes suggests the presence of two additional oxygen atoms in the oxidized species. To determine the site of oxidation, the reduced and oxidized Prx I enzymes separated in Fig. 2 A were digested with trypsin, and the resultant peptides were fractionated by reverse-phase HPLC (Fig.2 C). The HPLC elution profiles of the reduced and oxidized Prx I peptides were nearly identical except between 48 and 56 min (Fig.2 C). Major peptide peaks from the reduced and oxidized proteins were collected and analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS, enabling the assignment of 12 such peaks to defined fragments of Prx I. In addition to the disulfide-forming Cys51 and Cys172residues, Prx I contains two additional cysteine residues at positions 70 and 82. In both the reduced and oxidized states, the Cys172-containing peptide encompassing residues 168–189 eluted from the HPLC column at 26.1 min. Peptides containing both Cys70 and Cys82 were also unchanged: in both states, the peptides encompassing residues 67–91 (representing one missed trypsin cleavage site at Lys67) and residues 68–91 eluted at 35.5 and 36.8 min, respectively. However, retention of Cys51-containing peptides was altered by oxidation. In the reduced state, the peptides encompassing residues 27–61 (representing two missed trypsin cleavage sites at Lys34 and Lys36), residues 35–61 (representing one missed cleavage site at Lys36), and residues 37–61 eluted at 50.8, 51.7, and 55.1 min, respectively (Fig. 2 D). In the oxidized protein, however, none of these peaks corresponding to the three Cys51-containing peptides were observed. Instead, several peaks eluted near the expected positions. When the peaks at 49.7, 50.4, and 53.0 min were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS, each of them displayed a dominant and a minor ion separated by 16 mass units (Fig.2 D). Furthermore, the dominant ions derived from the oxidized peptides eluting at 49.7, 50.4, and 53.0 min were each larger by 32 mass units than those derived from reduced peptides encompassing residues 27–61, 35–61, and 37–61, respectively (Fig. 2 Dand Table I). These results support a model wherein Cys51-SH, but not Cys70-SH, Cys82-SH, or Cys172-SH, is hyperoxidized by H2O2 to Cys-SO2H and cysteic acid (Cys-SO3H).Table ICharacterization of Cys51-containing peptidesResiduesRetention timeMassSequenceTheoretical1-aTheoretical averagem/z values of singly charged ions ([M + H]+) calculated using GPMAW software (Lighthouse Data, Odense, Denmark).m/zObserved1-bAverage of at least three separate experiments with S.D. <0.02%.m/zmin27–611-cCys51-SH-containing peptide.50.84145.84145.4DISLSDYKGKYVVFFFYPLDFTFVCPTEIIAFSDR27–61-O2 1-dCys51-SO2H-containing peptide.49.74177.84177.527–61-O3 1-eCys51-SO3H-containing peptide.4193.84193.135–611-cCys51-SH-containing peptide.51.73223.83222.9GKYVVFFFYPLDFTFVCPTEIIAFSDR35–61-O2 1-dCys51-SO2H-containing peptide.50.43255.83254.935–61-O3 1-eCys51-SO3H-containing peptide.3271.83270.837–611-cCys51-SH-containing peptide.55.13038.53038.3YVVFFFYPLDFTFVCPTEIIAFSDR37–61-O2 1-dCys51-SO2H-containing peptide.53.03070.53070.337–61-O3 1-eCys51-SO3H-containing peptide.3086.53086.11-a Theoretical averagem/z values of singly charged ions ([M + H]+) calculated using GPMAW software (Lighthouse Data, Odense, Denmark).1-b Average of at least three separate experiments with S.D. <0.02%.1-c Cys51-SH-containing peptide.1-d Cys51-SO2H-containing peptide.1-e Cys51-SO3H-containing peptide. Open table in a new tab To demonstrate directly the formation of Cys51-SO2H, the amino acid sequence of the dominant ion ([M + 2H]2+, m/z1535.90) derived from peptide 37–61 was determined from the masses of the fragments arising from collision-induced dissociation of the peptide. The collision-induced dissociation MS/MS spectrum of the ion is shown in Fig. 2 E, along with the interpretation. The major daughter ions are y10 (m/z1148.5) and b15 (m/z 1922.5) ions, which derive from cleavage of the peptide bond between Cys51 and Pro52. The mass differences between b14 and b15 (135.2 Da), between y10and y11 (135.0 Da), and between z10 and z11 (135.0 Da) clearly indicate the presence of Cys-SO2H at Cys51. Mass spectral analysis of the tryptic peptides suggested that peroxide oxidation of Prx I Cys51 yielded mainly Cys51-SO2H, but also Cys51-SO3H to a lesser extent. In Fig. 2, Prx I was digested with trypsin for only 3 h before HPLC analysis. However, when oxidized Prx I was digested overnight with trypsin, Cys51-SO3H-containing peptides became the major products (data not shown). Furthermore, purified Cys51-SO2H-containing peptides were slowly autoxidized to Cys51-SO3H-containing peptides upon exposure to air (data not shown). However, longer exposure of intact Prx I to either H2O2 or air did not increase cysteic acid content (data not shown). Therefore, it appears that the formation of cysteic acid derivatives is the result of the air oxidation of Cys-SO2H-containing peptides. The sensitivity of Cys-SO2H to air has been reported (32Poole L.B. Claiborne A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12330-12338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cysteines 51 and 172 were individually replaced by serine residues to generate the C51S and C172S mutant enzymes, respectively. The wild-type and mutant enzymes were subjected to two-dimensional PAGE analysis before and after incubation with a peroxidase reaction mixture containing H2O2, NADPH, Trx, and TrxR (Fig.3). As observed in Fig. 1 C, the wild-type enzyme migrated predominantly to the more acidic position upon incubation with H2O2, suggesting that Cys51-SH was hyperoxidized to Cys-SO2H. As expected, no such shift was observed for C51S. C172S, which is catalytically inactive because Cys172-SH is required for disulfide formation by Cys51-SOH, did not undergo hyperoxidation. In contrast, when reducing equivalents were provided by DTT rather than by the Trx system (Trx, TrxR, and NADPH), C172S became hyperoxidized just as the wild-type enzyme did, whereas C51S was still resistant to hyperoxidation. As previously shown with a yeast Prx mutant in which the C-terminal conserved Cys was changed to Ser (1Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), C172S is fully active when supported by DTT even though it lacks peroxidase activity in the presence of the Trx system (data not shown). Such catalysis is possible because a small diffusible thiol molecule like DTT can replace Cys172-SH in the formation of a disulfide with Cys51-SOH. The disulfide is subsequently reduced by DTT. These results indicate that oxidation of Cys51-SH to Cys51-SO2H occurs only when Prx is engaged in the catalytic cycle. To further examine whether the accumulation of the hyperoxidized protein requires continuous passage through the catalytic cycle, Prx I was inactivated by incubation with H2O2, NADPH, TrxR, and varying concentrations of Trx. An aliquot of the reaction mixture was removed at various times and assayed for peroxidase activity by measuring NADPH oxidation coupled to H2O2 reduction. For each Trx concentration, the initial rate of NADPH oxidation was plotted against duration of inactivation to yield rates of enzyme inactivation (Fig.4 A). Prx I inactivation proceeded slowly in the absence of Trx and increased gradually with increasing Trx concentrations, reaching saturation at 4 μm Trx. The Trx dependence of inactivation is displayed by plotting the residual activities measured after a 3-min incubation with the inactivation reaction mixture against Trx concentration. Half-maximal inactivation occurred at <0.5 μm Trx. When either TrxR or NADPH was omitted from the i"

Moreover, Mg2+ increases the preference of hUNG2 toward uracil in ssDNA nearly 40-fold. APE1 has a strong stimulatory effect on hSMUG1 against dsU, apparently because of enhanced dissociation of hSMUG1 from AP sites in dsDNA. hSMUG1 also has a broader substrate specificity than hUNG2, including 5-hydroxymethyluracil and 3,N 4-ethenocytosine. hUNG2 is excluded from, whereas hSMUG1 accumulates in, nucleoli in living cells. In contrast, only hUNG2 accumulates in replication foci in the S-phase. hUNG2 in nuclear extracts initiates base excision repair of plasmids containing either U:A and U:G in vitro. Moreover, an additional but delayed repair of the U:G plasmid is observed that is not inhibited by neutralizing antibodies against hUNG2 or hSMUG1. We propose a model in which hUNG2 is responsible for both prereplicative removal of deaminated cytosine and postreplicative removal of misincorporated uracil at the replication fork.

Deamination of cytosine has been calculated from measured deamination rates to occur at a rate of 100–500 per human cell/day (1Frederico L.A. Kunkel T.A. Shaw B.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2532-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 2Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4299) Google Scholar) to yield mutagenic U:G mispairs. Uracil may also appear as a consequence of misincorporation of dUMP instead of dTMP during replication, resulting in a U:A base pair. The latter is not miscoding, but may produce cytotoxic and mutagenic AP site intermediates during repair. In organisms containing 5-methylcytosine in their genomes, deamination of 5-methylcytosine furthermore leads to T:G mismatches. All living organisms express uracil-DNA glycosylases (UDGs)1 that prevent cytotoxic and mutagenic effects of the above lesions. UDGs remove uracil (and sometimes other damaged bases or thymine) from the deoxyribose and thus initiate a multistep base excision repair (BER) pathway, eventually restoring the correct DNA sequence. After removal of uracil by an UDG and cleavage of the resulting abasic site by AP endonuclease (APE1/APE2), the BER pathway splits into two branches (reviewed in Ref. 3Dogliotti E. Fortini P. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 68: 3-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presumed major track is the short-patch pathway. It uses the 5′- deoxyribophosphodiesterase activity of DNA polymerase β to cleave 3′ of the abasic site, thus releasing deoxyribose-5-phosphate. Then pol β inserts C or T, depending on the template base. Finally, DNA ligase III seals the nick, perhaps aided by the scaffold protein XRCC1. The alternative long-patch pathway largely uses replication proteins and may take place in replication foci (4Otterlei M. Warbrick E. Nagelhus T.A. Haug T. Slupphaug G. Akbari M. Aas P.A. Steinsbekk K. Bakke O. Krokan H.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3834-3844Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). This pathway requires pol ε and/or δ, as well as the trimeric sliding clamp and polymerase processivity factor proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and the clamp loader replication factor C (RFC). Repair synthesis is stimulated by pol β, which may be important in the first step of polymerization. The structure-specific endonuclease FEN1 removes the 2–8-nucleotide displaced “flap” of DNA, and DNA ligase I seals the nick (3Dogliotti E. Fortini P. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 68: 3-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian cells contain at least four UDGs, of which three (UNG, SMUG1, and TDG) belong to the same protein superfamily, possess the same fold, and have probably evolved from a common ancestor (5Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Genome Biol. 2000; 1: 7.1-7.8Crossref Google Scholar). Of these, UNG appears to be quantitatively dominating as determined from activity assays using human cell-free extracts and U:A substrates (6Slupphaug G. Eftedal I. Kavli B. Bharati S. Helle N.M. Haug T. Levine D.W. Krokan H.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). UNG belongs to the family of highly conserved UDGs typified byEscherichia coli Ung, and is present in a large number of eukaryotes, bacteria, and large eukaryotic DNA viruses (7Krokan H.E. Standal R. Slupphaug G. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). The human and mouse UNG genes encode both mitochondrial (UNG1) and nuclear (UNG2) forms of the enzyme by way of alternative promoter usage and mRNA splicing (8Nilsen H. Otterlei M. Haug T. Solum K. Nagelhus T.A. Skorpen F. Krokan H.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 750-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain of hUNG has been extensively studied, and its structure and molecular mechanism of catalysis and specificity established (9Mol C.D. Arvai A.S. Slupphaug G. Kavli B. Alseth I.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3442-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The enzyme removes uracil in vitro in the order of preference ssU > U:G > U:A (6Slupphaug G. Eftedal I. Kavli B. Bharati S. Helle N.M. Haug T. Levine D.W. Krokan H.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Certain closely related bases formed from cytosine after γ-irradiation or oxidative stress are also substrates, such as 5-hydroxyuracil, isodialuric acid, and alloxan (13Dizdaroglu M. Karakaya A. Jaruga P. Slupphaug G. Krokan H.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 418-422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These are, however, excised at a very low rate compared with uracil. A second human UDG against both ss- and dsU, hSMUG1 (single-strand selective monofunctional uracil-DNA glycosylase), was identified more recently byin vitro expression cloning (14Haushalter K.A. Todd Stukenberg M.W. Kirschner M.W. Verdine G.L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 174-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). SMUG1 is not found in bacteria and yeast, but is present in higher eukaryotes. Although they probably share the same fold and motifs necessary for substrate binding and catalysis as hUNG, little homology exists between the two enzymes at the amino acid level (5Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Genome Biol. 2000; 1: 7.1-7.8Crossref Google Scholar). hSMUG1 is furthermore located in the nuclei, and Xenopus SMUG1 has a substrate preference similar to the catalytic hUNG domain (ssU > U:G > U:A), although its specific activity is considerably lower (14Haushalter K.A. Todd Stukenberg M.W. Kirschner M.W. Verdine G.L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 174-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Recently, Boorstein and co-workers (15Boorstein R.J. Cummings Jr., A. Marenstein D.R. Chan M.K., Ma, Y. Neubert T.A. Brown S.M. Teebor G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41991-41997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) demonstrated that hSMUG1 is also active against 5-hydroxymethyluracil (HmU:A). HmU is formed in DNA by oxidative attack on the methyl group of thymine, thereby creating HmU:A. It is also the product of the deamination of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, which may be formed via oxidation of 5-methylcytosine. The latter creates a HmU:G base pair, which would be mutagenic if left unrepaired. Although HmU:G substrates were not tested, the authors suggested the latter could be a biologically important substrate (15Boorstein R.J. Cummings Jr., A. Marenstein D.R. Chan M.K., Ma, Y. Neubert T.A. Brown S.M. Teebor G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41991-41997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This is also supported by the fact that transition mutation from 5mC:G to T:A is the most frequent substitution mutation in human cancer (16Cooper D.N. Youssoufian H. Hum. Genet. 1988; 78: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). The two last UDGs identified in human cells, TDG and MBD4 (MED1), are both mismatch-specific and have no activity against single-stranded substrates. TDG excises uracil and thymine from U:G and T:G mismatches, as well as 3,N 4-ethenocytosine (εC) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) from double-stranded DNA, and may restore G:C base pairs at sites of cytosine or 5-methylcytosine deamination, or alkylation, respectively (17Hardeland U. Bentele M. Lettieri T. Steinacher R. Jiricny J. Schar P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 68: 235-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MBD4, which does not belong to the same superfamily as the three other UDGs, acts on uracil, thymine, 5-FU, and εC mispaired with guanine (18Bellacosa A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), as well as on 5-methylcytosine at hemimethylated DNA (19Zhu B. Zheng Y. Angliker H. Schwarz S. Thiry S. Siegmann M. Jost J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4157-4165Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The preferred substrates, however, are G:T mismatches at methylated or unmethylated CpG islands. Thus, MBD4, as well as TDG, may have a function in the correction of T:G mismatches originating from deamination of 5-methylcytosine. Several lines of evidence indicate that nuclear UNG2 has a major role in postreplicative removal of misincorporated uracil in mammalian cells (4Otterlei M. Warbrick E. Nagelhus T.A. Haug T. Slupphaug G. Akbari M. Aas P.A. Steinsbekk K. Bakke O. Krokan H.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3834-3844Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The contribution of UNG2 to repair of deaminated cytosines has, however, been debated. Whereas bacterial and yeastung − mutants display a mutator phenotype unable to repair deaminated cytosines (20Duncan B.K. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 750-755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Impellizzeri K.J. Anderson B. Burgers P.M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6807-6810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), such a phenotype is not clearly observed in Ung −/− mice (22Nilsen H. Rosewell I. Robins P. Skjelbred C.F. Andersen S. Slupphaug G. Daly G. Krokan H.E. Lindahl T. Barnes D.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Based on this finding, and comparison of kinetic parameters of theXenopus SMUG1 (14Haushalter K.A. Todd Stukenberg M.W. Kirschner M.W. Verdine G.L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 174-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and the hUNG catalytic domain (6Slupphaug G. Eftedal I. Kavli B. Bharati S. Helle N.M. Haug T. Levine D.W. Krokan H.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), it was suggested that in higher eukaryotes, the contribution of UNG2 to the excision of deaminated cytosines was reduced, and that this function might instead be provided by SMUG1 (23Nilsen H. Haushalter K.A. Robins P. Barnes D.E. Verdine G.L. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4278-4286Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In human cells, however, the UNG catalytic domain alone is not observed in the nucleus (24Muller-Weeks S. Mastran B. Caradonna S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21909-21917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Rather, the entire N-terminal regulatory domain remains attached to the core catalytic domain after nuclear translocation. Until now, little information has existed on the enzymatic properties of full-length hUNG2. A likely reason for this is the susceptibility of the enzyme to N-terminal proteolytic degradation during purification, mainly resulting in the core catalytic domain (25Wittwer C.U. Bauw G. Krokan H.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 780-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To gain further insight in the functional properties of hUNG2 and hSMUG1 and their relative contribution to nuclear base excision repair, both proteins were purified after overexpression in E. coli. In depth biochemical characterization and analysis of subnuclear localization revealed previously unrecognized properties of both hUNG2 and hSMUG1 that may have important implications for their functions in nuclear BER in vivo. AnNdeI site was introduced at the hUNG2 translation start codon, and a 947-bp NdeI/HpaI fragment encompassing the entire hUNG2 coding region was ligated into the new vector pJB658cop251kan. This expression vector was constructed by introducing a high copy number variant of thetrfA gene (Arg-251 → Met) and changing the resistance from ampicillin to kanamycin in the toluic acid-inducible, broad host vector pJB658 (26Blatny J.M. Brautaset T. Winther-Larsen H.C. Karunakaran P. Valla S. Plasmid. 1997; 38: 35-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The resultant construct, p658KanUng2 was introduced intoE. coli BL21. Fermentation, preparation of crude extract, and the initial chromatographic steps were essentially as described for the hUNG catalytic domain (6Slupphaug G. Eftedal I. Kavli B. Bharati S. Helle N.M. Haug T. Levine D.W. Krokan H.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) except that the culture was induced by 1 mm toluic acid (final) and allowed to grow for additionally 3 h at 30 °C before harvesting. Furthermore, Complete® mini (EDTA-free) (Roche) protease inhibitor tablets were included in the initial steps of the purification (1 tablet/10 ml during homogenization and 1 tablet/l ml in subsequent buffers). During size exclusion chromatography on Superdex 75 26/60 (Amersham Biosciences), buffer was changed to 20 mmHEPES-NaOH (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT. Pooled active fractions were loaded onto a MonoS HR 5/5 column, and after washing to base-line absorbance, bound proteins were eluted using a linear NaCl gradient from 100 mm to 1 m NaCl in the same buffer. To remove partially N-terminally deleted species, the purest fractions were subjected to MonoS rechromatography and fractions containing the highest portion of apparently full-length protein were pooled. The purified protein was finally concentrated by ultrafiltration and snap-frozen in liquid N2 prior to storage at −80 °C. IMAGE clone identification no. 726197 containing the hSMUG1 cDNA in pT7T3D was cut using NdeI and BfaI, and the 1154-bp fragment encoding hSMUG1 was cloned into the NdeI site of pET11a (Invitrogen). The resultant vector was transformed intoE. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene) and bacterial cell mass for purification produced by fermentation. Expression was induced by 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final) at 37 °C and the culture allowed to grow for additional 4 h prior to cell harvest. Preparation of the hSMUG1 crude extract was essentially as described for the hUNG catalytic domain (6Slupphaug G. Eftedal I. Kavli B. Bharati S. Helle N.M. Haug T. Levine D.W. Krokan H.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), except that homogenization and protamine sulfate precipitation was performed in 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 6.8), 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 tablet/10 ml Complete® mini (EDTA-free) protease inhibitor mixture (buffer A). The protamine sulfate fraction was loaded onto a DEAE-Sephacel column (Amersham Biosciences, 5 × 9 cm) coupled in series with a CM-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences, 5 × 8.5 cm). After washing to base-line absorbance, the DEAE-Sephacel column was bypassed and adsorbed proteins were eluted in a 0.05–1m NaCl gradient in buffer A. Active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 8), 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT (buffer B) and applied to a UnoS-12 column (Bio-Rad). Adsorbed proteins were eluted in a 0.01–0.7m linear NaCl gradient. Active fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration to 5 ml and loaded onto a Superdex 75 HiLoad 26/60 column (Amersham Biosciences) preequilibrated with buffer B containing 100 mm NaCl, and eluted with the same buffer. Fractions containing hSMUG1 were verified by SDS-PAGE and pooled. After a 4-fold dilution in buffer B, hSMUG1 was loaded onto a poly(U)-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences, 1.6 × 10 cm) preequilibrated with buffer B containing 2 mm EDTA. Adsorbed proteins were eluted in a 0.01–1 m linear NaCl gradient in the same buffer and the fractions containing hSMUG1 identified by SDS-PAGE and pooled. The poly(U)-Sepharose fraction was then dialyzed against buffer B, applied onto a MonoS HR 5/5 column, and eluted in a linear 0.01–1 m NaCl gradient in the same buffer. The purest hSMUG1 fractions were collected, and the remaining hSMUG1-containing fractions rechromatographed on MonoS as above. The pooled hSMUG1 fraction was apparently homogeneous as determined by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. The purified protein was finally concentrated by ultrafiltration and snap-frozen in liquid N2 prior to storage at −80 °C. Polyclonal PU101 against the hUNG catalytic domain was prepared as described (6Slupphaug G. Eftedal I. Kavli B. Bharati S. Helle N.M. Haug T. Levine D.W. Krokan H.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Polyclonal PSM1 against hSMUG1 was prepared by subcutaneous injection of 66 μg of purified, recombinant hSMUG1 in Freund's complete adjuvant at the neck and flank of New Zealand White rabbits. Subsequent immunizations with the same amount of hSMUG1 in incomplete Freund's adjuvant were performed as above at 3-week intervals, and the final bleed 10 days after the last immunization. IgG-fractions of PU101 and PSM1 were purified on protein A-Sepharose HiTrap columns (AmershamBiosciences) before being used in inhibition experiments. Spontaneously transformed human keratinocytes HaCaT, colorectal carcinoma CX-1, and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 0.03% glutamine, and 0.1 mg/ml gentamicin at 5% CO2. Cells were harvested in the logarithmic growth phase by trypsinization, washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline prior to isolation of nuclei. Subsequently, CX-1 and HeLa were washed once in ice-cold isotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.8), 1 mmMgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, and 250 mm sucrose). The pellet was resuspended in hypotonic buffer (isotonic buffer without sucrose) containing Complete®protease inhibitor mix (1 tablet/50 ml) and left on ice for 45 min to swell. Cells were lysed by 10–20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer (tight-fitting pestle), and nuclei pelleted by centrifugation at 600 × g for 6 min. The pellets were resuspended in hypertonic buffer (hypotonic buffer with 0.5 m NaCl and 25% glycerol), and incubated at 4 °C on a rotary shaker at high speed for 30 min to extract nuclear proteins. Nuclear debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min, protein concentration in the supernatant measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay (BSA as standard), and the nuclear extract aliquoted, snap-frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C until use. Nuclei from HaCaT keratinocytes were prepared using the NuClear® nuclear extraction kit (Sigma) according to the protocol form the manufacturer, using isotonic buffer and detergent. Serum starvation, [3H]thymidine pulse labeling, and harvesting of HaCaT cells were as described (27Haug T. Skorpen F. Aas P.A. Malm V. Skjelbred C. Krokan H.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1449-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Polyclonal PSM1 antiserum was covalently coupled to magnetic protein A Dynabeads (Dynal, Norway) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Cells (5 × 105) from each time point were resuspended in 1.5 ml of lysis buffer (1× Tris-buffered saline, 1 mg/ml BSA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 tablet/50 ml Complete® maxi+EDTA (Roche) protease inhibitors) and passed 10 times through a 21-gauge syringe needle. PSM1-coupled magnetic beads (10 μl) were added, and the extract incubated on a rotary shaker for 2 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing, the beads were eluted by boiling in SDS loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After electroblotting to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, bands were visualized by standard Western analysis using PSM1 as primary antibodies, HRP swine × rabbit secondary antibodies (Dako), and ECL (Amersham Biosciences). PCR was run on DNA from IMAGE clone cDNA_id 726197 encoding hSMUG1 in pT7T3D, using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene), a T7 primer, and the primer 5′-ATT TCA ACA GCA GTG GCA GC-3′. The PCR product was purified by QIAQuick PCR purification (Qiagen) and digested withEcoRI. The PCR fragment (EcoRI/blunt) encoding hSMUG1 was cloned into EcoRI/SmaI of pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). hSMUG1 and hUNG2 cDNA from pSMUG1-EGFP and pUNG2EGFP (4Otterlei M. Warbrick E. Nagelhus T.A. Haug T. Slupphaug G. Akbari M. Aas P.A. Steinsbekk K. Bakke O. Krokan H.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3834-3844Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) were ligated into pEYFP-N1 (Clontech) by transferring theNheI/AgeI fragment into the corresponding sites in pEYFP-N1 to make SMUG1-EYFP and UNG2-EYFP, respectively. To make the C-terminal fusion of SMUG1 with EYFP, theEcoRI/BamHI fragment from SMUG1-EYFP was ligated with EcoRI/BamHI-digested pEYFP-C1 (Clontech). The resulting vector was digested with SacI, the 3′ overhang removed by T4 DNA polymerase, and the vector re-ligated to make EYFP-SMUG1. The fusion constructs were verified to be in-frame by sequencing. The construct carrying the hUNG2 promoter, pGL2-PA (27Haug T. Skorpen F. Aas P.A. Malm V. Skjelbred C. Krokan H.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1449-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), was digested with HindIII/EcoRV to remove the luciferase gene. The HindIII/DraI fragment from pUNG2-EYFP was then ligated withHindIII/EcoRV-digested pGL2-PA. From this plasmid, the SacI/NotI fragment containing ProA-UNG2-EYFP was excised, and ligated intoSacI/NotI-digested pEGFP-1 (Clontech), thus replacing the EGFP-coding sequence in the vector and giving pProA-UNG2-EYFP. ECFP-PCNA fusion constructs were prepared from pEGFP-PCNAL2 (28Leonhardt H. Rahn H.P. Weinzierl P. Sporbert A. Cremer T. Zink D. Cardoso M.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), which contains the SV40 NLS in front of PCNA in a C-terminal fusion with EGFP. The SV40 NLS was amplified by using PCR primers containing the sites for the restriction enzymesNheI and AgeI. After digestion withNheI and AgeI, the fragment was cloned into the corresponding sites in the pECFP-C1 vectors (Clontech). Next, theBsrGI (in EGFP)/XbaI (behind PCNA) fragment from the pEGFP-PCNAL2 construct was cloned into theBrsGI/XbaI sites of pECFP-C1 vector with the SV40 NLS N-terminally, giving pNLS-ECFP-PCNA (named pECFP-PCNA). HeLa cells were transiently and stably transfected by using calcium phosphate (Profection, Promega) according to the recommendations from the manufacturer. Stable transfectants of HeLa with pProA-UNG2-EYFP were further cloned by use of limited dilutions in 96-microwell dishes in medium containing G418. The cells were examined in a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning microscope equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 oil immersion objective. The 458-nm laser line was used for excitation of ECFP (detected at 480 nm < λECFP < 520 nm) and the 514-nm laser line for EYFP (detected at λEYFP > 560 nm). Unless otherwise stated, UDG activity was measured in 20 μl of assay mixture containing (final) 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1.8 μm [3H]dUMP-containing calf thymus DNA (specific activity 0.5 mCi/μmol) and varying amounts of enzyme. The mixture was incubated 10 min at 30 °C, and the amount of released uracil measured as described (29Krokan H. Wittwer C.U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 2599-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Kinetic assays using 0.24–21.5 μm calf thymus substrate were performed in the buffer above. In separate experiments kinetic parameters were measured in the presence of either 7.5 mm MgCl2 or 7.5 mm MgCl2 and 0.44 ng/μl APE1 in the same buffer (molar ratio of APE1/glycosylase at least 10/1). The amount of hUNG2 or hSMUG1 used in the kinetic assays was adjusted to ensure that less than 30% of the substrate was consumed, to ensure linearity of the assay. Kinetic parameters were calculated using the Enzpack for Windows version 1.4 software package (Biosoft) using the method of Wilkinson. Enzyme kinetic parameters were also analyzed using a panel of oligonucleotide substrates. These were prepared by33P-5′-end labeling of 19-mer PAGE-purified oligonucleotides containing U or HmU at a central position (U141, 5′-CATAAAGTGUAAAGCCTGG-3′; HmU141, 5′-CATAAAGTGHmUAAAGCCTGG-3′). To generate double-stranded substrates, the labeled strands were annealed to a 50% excess of the complementary strand containing either A or G opposite U or HmU. Varying substrate concentrations (0.1–15 μm) were made by addition of identical non-labeled oligonucleotides. The kinetic assays (10 μl total) were performed in the same buffer as for the [3H]dUMP-containing calf thymus DNA in the presence of MgCl2. After 10 min of incubation at 30 °C, the reactions were stopped by addition of 50 μl of 1 m piperidine and heated at 90 °C for 20 min to cleave at AP sites. Piperidine was removed by drying under vacuum, and the oligonucleotides redissolved in 65% formamide loading buffer and analyzed by denaturing PAGE (12% polyacrylamide, 7 murea). Cleaved and uncleaved oligonucleotides were quantified by phosphorimaging. Kinetic parameters were calculated as above. In separate experiments, the activities of hUNG2 and hSMUG1 were directly compared by using ds oligonucleotides (20 nm final) having the same sequence as above, and containing U:G, HmU:G, 5-fluorouracil:A (FU:A), 3,N4-ethenocytosine:G (εC:G), or 5-hydroxyuracil:G (5-OHU:G). To detect activity against the weaker substrates, reactions contained varying amounts of hUNG2 or hSMUG1 (0–10 ng/μl final) and were incubated at 37 °C for 30 in the presence of 7.5 mm Mg2+ with or without APE1 (0.1 ng/μl final). Inhibition of hSMUG1 and hUNG2 by polyclonal antibodies or oligonucleotides containing AP sites was monitored after incubation of the purified enzymes or cell extracts with inhibitor for 10 min on ice prior to the enzyme assays. Double-stranded plasmid DNA substrates containing uracil at defined positions were prepared essentially as described (30Frosina G. Capelli E. Fortini P. Dogliotti E. Henderson D.E. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1998: 301-315Google Scholar). Briefly 20 μg of ssDNA (pGEM-3zf+) was annealed to 4.2 μg of a 22-mer complementary oligonucleotide containing uracil and synthesis of duplex DNA carried out in the presence of T4 DNA polymerase, T4 DNA ligase, and T4 gene 32 ssDNA-binding protein at 37 °C for 2h. Closed circular DNA duplex molecules were purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation. The base excision repair mixtures (50 μl) contained (final) 40 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.8), 70 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 2 mm ATP, 20 μm dATP, 20 μm dGTP, 8 μm dTTP or dCTP depending on the isotope used, 8 μm phosphocreatine, 0.36 mg/ml BSA, 1 μg/ml"

https://openalex.org/W1980920372,"Folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism is required for the synthesis of purines and thymidylate and for the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. Methionine is subsequently adenylated to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a cofactor that methylates DNA, RNA, proteins, and many metabolites. Previous experimental and theoretical modeling studies have indicated that folate cofactors are limiting for cytoplasmic folate-dependent reactions and that the synthesis of DNA precursors competes with SAM synthesis. Each of these studies concluded that SAM synthesis has a higher metabolic priority than dTMP synthesis. The influence of cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase (cSHMT) on this competition was examined in MCF-7 cells. Increases in cSHMT expression inhibit SAM concentrations by two proposed mechanisms: (1) cSHMT-catalyzed serine synthesis competes with the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase for methylenetetrahydrofolate in a glycine-dependent manner, and (2Wagner C. Bailey L.B. Folate in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 23-42Google Scholar) cSHMT, a high affinity 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-binding protein, sequesters this cofactor and inhibits methionine synthesis in a glycine-independent manner. Stable isotope tracer studies indicate that cSHMT plays an important role in mediating the flux of one-carbon units between dTMP and SAM syntheses. We conclude that cSHMT has three important functions in the cytoplasm: (1) it preferentially supplies one-carbon units for thymidylate biosynthesis, (2Wagner C. Bailey L.B. Folate in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 23-42Google Scholar) it depletes methylenetetrahydrofolate pools for SAM synthesis by synthesizing serine, and (3Shane B. Bailey L.B. Folate in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 1-22Google Scholar) it sequesters 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and inhibits SAM synthesis. These results indicate that cSHMT is a metabolic switch that, when activated, gives dTMP synthesis higher metabolic priority than SAM synthesis. Folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism is required for the synthesis of purines and thymidylate and for the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. Methionine is subsequently adenylated to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a cofactor that methylates DNA, RNA, proteins, and many metabolites. Previous experimental and theoretical modeling studies have indicated that folate cofactors are limiting for cytoplasmic folate-dependent reactions and that the synthesis of DNA precursors competes with SAM synthesis. Each of these studies concluded that SAM synthesis has a higher metabolic priority than dTMP synthesis. The influence of cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase (cSHMT) on this competition was examined in MCF-7 cells. Increases in cSHMT expression inhibit SAM concentrations by two proposed mechanisms: (1) cSHMT-catalyzed serine synthesis competes with the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase for methylenetetrahydrofolate in a glycine-dependent manner, and (2Wagner C. Bailey L.B. Folate in Health and Disease.

Bailey L.B. Folate in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 1-22Google Scholar). Mitochondrial folate metabolism is necessary for the conversion of serine to glycine and formate (a one-carbon unit) (1Appling D.R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2645-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar,3Shane B. Bailey L.B. Folate in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 1-22Google Scholar), whereas cytoplasmic folate metabolism utilizes mitochondria-derived formate for the biosynthesis of purines (supplies the #2 and #8 carbons of the purine ring), thymidine (conversion of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP) and for the generation of methionine from homocysteine (1Appling D.R.

Methionine, in turn, can be converted toS-adenosylmethionine (SAM),1 a cofactor for many methylation reactions, including the methylation of proteins, phospholipids, neurotransmitters, RNA, and DNA (4Selhub J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 217-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar, 5Clarke S. Banfield K. Jacobson D.W. Homocysteine in Health and Disease. Cambridge Press, Cambridge2001: 63-78Google Scholar). Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) catalyzes the reversible transfer of the hydroxymethyl group of serine to tetrahydrofolate (THF) to form methyleneTHF and glycine (6Schirch V. Strong W.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The enzyme is present in both the mitochondria and cytoplasm (7Stover P.J. Chen L.H. Suh J.R. Stover D.M.

Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Loss of mitochondrial SHMT (mSHMT) function cannot be rescued by the activity of the cytoplasmic SHMT (cSHMT) isozyme in cultured cells; some evidence suggests that cSHMT may be a serine synthase in the cytoplasm (7Stover P.J.

Biophys. 1980; 200: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cellular folate derivatives are sequestered by a variety of proteins collectively called folate-binding proteins (2Wagner C. Bailey L.B. Folate in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 23-42Google Scholar, 10Yeo E.J. Briggs W.T. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37559-37564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The cellular concentration of folate-binding proteins exceeds that of folate derivatives, and therefore the concentration of free folate in the cell is negligible (6Schirch V. Strong W.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 11Strong W.B. Tendler S.J. Seither R.L. Goldman I.D. Schirch V. J. Biol.

This implies that folate-dependent biosynthetic pathways must compete for folate cofactors (12Suh J.R. Herbig A.K. Stover P.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 255-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 13Scott J.M. Dinn J.J. Wilson P. Weir D.G. Lancet. 1981; 2: 334-337Abstract PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). This competition for folate cofactors is most pronounced for reactions that utilize methyleneTHF, a derivative that serves as a cofactor in three known enzymatic reactions in the cytoplasm (see Fig. 1). It is required for the conversion of dUMP to dTMP, catalyzed by thymidylate synthase (TS); for the conversion of glycine to serine, catalyzed by cSHMT; and for the synthesis of 5-methylTHF, catalyzed by methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), a reaction that commits one-carbon units to the methionine cycle. Because the MTHFR reaction is virtually irreversible in vivo(1Appling D.R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2645-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 2Wagner C. Bailey L.B. Folate in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 23-42Google Scholar), methionine synthase (MS) activity is essential for recycling 5-methylTHF to other folate cofactor forms. Otherwise, 5-methylTHF accumulates at the expense of all other folate derivatives, impairing folate-dependent deoxyribonucleotide synthesis. This phenomenon is known as the “methyl trap,” a state of functional folate deficiency and impaired DNA synthesis (3Shane B. Bailey L.B. Folate in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 1-22Google Scholar, 13Scott J.M. Dinn J.J. Wilson P. Weir D.G. Lancet. 1981; 2: 334-337Abstract PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). SAM inhibits MTHFR and thereby provides feedback regulation that protects against a folate methyl trap (see Fig. 1) and ensures that, during methionine repletion, folate-activated one-carbon units are spared for DNA precursor synthesis. During B12 deficiency, apo-MS cannot convert 5-methylTHF to THF, resulting in the accumulation of cytoplasmic folate as 5-methylTHF, homocysteine accumulation and in decreased SAM synthesis (4Selhub J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 217-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar, 14Scott J.M. Weir D.G. Lancet. 1981; 2: 337-340Abstract PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Depleted SAM leads to an increase in MTHFR activity and accelerated 5-methylTHF synthesis, thereby exacerbating the metabolic dysfunction. Although inhibition of MTHFR by SAM certainly contributes to the prevention of methyl trapping under normal conditions, there is evidence that competition among folate-dependent enzymes also regulates the supply of one-carbon units to the methionine cycle. Fowler et al. (15Fowler B. Whitehouse C. Wenzel F. Wraith J.E. Pediatr. Res. 1997; 41: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) examined the formation of both methionine and serine in human fibroblasts. In fibroblasts where MS activity was deficient due to a variety of genetic mutations, serine formation was low compared with control cells, consistent with the formation of a folate methyl trap. Moreover, mutant fibroblasts with diminished MTHFR activity exhibited normal to high serine formation, indicating that MTHFR deficiency increased the availability of 5,10-methyleneTHF for cSHMT-catalyzed synthesis of serine from glycine (15Fowler B. Whitehouse C. Wenzel F. Wraith J.E. Pediatr. Res. 1997; 41: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The cSHMT enzyme is poised to regulate the metabolic competition between TS and MTHFR (see Fig. 1). The reaction catalyzed by cSHMT is reversible in vitro, and therefore its capacity to affect this competition in vivo is expected to be dependent on cellular glycine concentrations. Previously, we have demonstrated that the cSHMT enzyme is robustly regulated by heavy chain ferritin (HCF) and that HCF-induced increases in cSHMT expression enhance de novo thymidylate synthesis (16Oppenheim E.W. Adelman C. Liu X. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19855-19861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the effect of altered cSHMT expression and activity on the homocysteine remethylation pathway and the influence of glycine on cSHMT activity and folate metabolism. Fetal bovine serum and α-minimal essential media (αMEM) lacking sodium bicarbonate, ribosides, ribotides, deoxyribosides, and deoxyribotides were obtained from HyClone Laboratories, Inc. (Logan, UT). Stable isotopes were obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Woburn, MA. Human MCF-7 mammary adenocarcinoma cells (ATCC, #HTB22) were cultured in αMEM, 2.5 g/liter NaHCO3, 11.2% (v/v) fetal calf serum, and maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The MCFHCF cell line, which expresses rat heavy chain ferritin, and the MCFcSHMT21cell line, which expresses the human cSHMT cDNA, were described previously (16Oppenheim E.W. Adelman C. Liu X. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19855-19861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). MCFGlyT cells were developed by subcloning the murine glycine transporter cDNA (GlyT1, obtained from Dr. Nathan Nelson, Roche Institute of Molecular Biology) (17Liu Q.R. Nelson H. Mandiyan S. Lopez-Corcuera B. Nelson N. FEBS Lett. 1992; 305: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) into the EcoRI/XhoI site of the vector pcDNA3. TheGlyT1 construct was transfected into MCF-7 cells (2 × 106 cells) by electroporation (0.22 kV, 950 microfarads) and cultured until stable G418 colonies formed and isolated. GlyT1 activity is dependent on the presence of Na+ and Cl− (17Liu Q.R. Nelson H. Mandiyan S. Lopez-Corcuera B. Nelson N. FEBS Lett. 1992; 305: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). MCFGlyT cells (1 × 107) in mid- to late-log phase were incubated with 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.1 μCi of [2-3H]glycine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 1 mm unlabeled glycine. Control cells were incubated with a similar buffer lacking NaCl but containing 200 mm KCl to inhibit transport by GlyT. Transport was allowed to proceed for 30 min at room temperature; then the cells were pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times with 100 volumes of cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellets were lysed with 0.5% Triton X-100 in 10 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.5), and the accumulation of [2-3H]glycine was determined using a liquid scintillation counter. Intracellular amino acid pools were determined as previously described (18Girgis S. Suh J.R. Jolivet J. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4729-4734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured to 60–80% confluence in 100-mm plates and exposed to experimental culture medium 24 h prior to labeling with [3H]folinic acid (Moravek). The culture medium (αMEM-modified (HyClone), 2.5 g/liter NaHCO3, 11.2% (v/v) dialyzed fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 0.1 mmmethionine) lacked ribo- and deoxyribonucleosides, hypoxanthine, thymidine, folic acid, and serine unless otherwise noted. For all experiments, 20 nm [3H]folinic acid was added to the medium, and glycine was added at concentrations ranging from 0 to 50 mm. After 24 h, media were removed from cells, and cells were washed twice with 2 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lifted from the plate by incubation with 0.75–1 ml of trypsin-EDTA at room temperature for 5–10 min. The cell suspension was pelleted, and the cells were washed with 0.75 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. After removing the supernatant, the cell pellet was frozen at −80 °C. The relative distribution of the folate one-carbon forms was quantified by high performance liquid chromatography as described previously (18Girgis S. Suh J.R. Jolivet J. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4729-4734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). SAM and SAH concentrations were determined in cells cultured as described above, except that the methionine concentration was 10 μm and folinic acid was 50 nm. Cell extracts for SAM and SAH analyses were prepared by a modification of the previously described procedure (19Struys E.A. Jansen E.E. de Meer K. Jakobs C. Clin. Chem. 2000; 46: 1650-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Cells were suspended in 500 μl of 0.1m NaAcO buffer (pH 6), and cellular proteins were precipitated by adding 312 μl of 10% perchloric acid to each sample. After vortexing, samples were centrifuged at 2000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was neutralized with 1m sodium phosphate (pH 11.5) and diluted 2-fold with deionized water. The pellet was saved and stored at −80 °C for subsequent measurement of total protein. The supernatant was applied to C18 Sep-Pak Plus cartridges (Waters Corp.) primed with 5 mm1-heptanesulfonic acid (Acros) in methanol. The column was washed with 5 ml of deionized water before SAM and SAH were eluted in 2 ml of methanol. After addition of 50 μl of 3 m NaAcO (final pH of 5.5) to the eluate, the sample was dried under vacuum. SAM and SAH were converted to their fluorescent derivatives by adding 50 μl of chloroacetaldehyde and incubating at 60 °C for 1 h. Purified SAM and SAH from Sigma-Aldrich were used to generate standard curves from which sample SAM and SAH content were determined. Each standard was prepared as described for the tissue extracts. Samples were loaded onto a C8 column (5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm, from Phenomenex) fitted with a C18 guard column (5 μm, 30 × 4.6 mm) operated by a Shimadzu SCL-10A system controller module connected to an LC-10AS solvent delivery unit and an RF-10A spectrofluorometric detector. Fluorescence of eluted compounds was monitored using λex = 270 nm and λem = 410 nm. A two-buffer elution system was used: both buffers were 10 mm1-heptanesulfonic acid (Acros) in 25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 3) with Buffer A and Buffer B containing 18 and 30% methanol by volume, respectively. Elution of SAM and SAH was achieved at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with the following parameters: 0–10 min, 100% A; 10–20 min, linear gradient to 100% B; 20–30 min, 100% B; 30–35 min, linear gradient to 100% A; 35–40 min, 100% A. SAM and SAH values were normalized to cellular protein content that was determined using the Lowry-Bensadoun method (20Bensadoun A. Weinstein D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2733) Google Scholar). The efficiency of de novo thymidine biosynthesis was determined using a modified deoxyuridine suppression assay that was described previously (16Oppenheim E.W. Adelman C. Liu X. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19855-19861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in 100-mm plates at 30–50% confluence in treatment media (10 g/liter HyQ αMEM-modified (HyClone), 2.5 g/liter NaHCO3, 11.2% (v/v) dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 0.05 μm folinic acid, 10 μm methionine, glycine at concentrations ranging from 0 to 10 mm, 26 mg/literl-[5,5,5-2H3]leucine, but lacking ribo- and deoxyribonucleosides, hypoxanthine, thymidine and serine]. Media were supplemented with either [13C]-formate (250 μm) orl-[2,3,3-2H3]serine (250 μm) and were refreshed every 48–72 h. Cells were passaged for 2 to 4 population doublings. Media were removed and cells washed in 2 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cellular protein was isolated by lysing whole cell pellets with 600 μl of 5% trichloroacetic acid and pelleting the protein by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the supernatant and pellet were stored separately at −80 °C for further analyses. Total genomic DNA was isolated using a QIAamp DNA Blood Mini kit (Qiagen). Protein pellets were suspended in 6 n HCl (100 μl) in vacuum hydrolysis tubes and heated at 100 °C for 20 h. The amino acids were purified by cation exchange chromatography (21Lichtenstein A.H.

Isotopic enrichment was determined in electron capture negative ionization mode by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using a model 6890 gas chromatograph and model 5973 mass spectrometer (Hewlett-Packard Corp., Palo Alto, CA). Selected ion monitoring was conducted at a mass-to-charge ratio m/z 519–523 for serine,m/z 305–308 for dehydroalanine (DHA),m/z 349–353 for leucine,m/z 367–370 for methionine, andm/z 293–295 for glycine. DNA samples were dried under nitrogen and suspended in formic acid (1 ml) and hydrolyzed at 150 °C for 45 min in vacuum hydrolysis tubes. After drying at 55 °C under nitrogen, the bases were dissolved in 0.2 ml of a 1:1 mixture ofN,O-bis-[trimethylsilyl]trifluoroacetamide /1% trimethylchlorosilane (Pierce) and acetonitrile, and heated at 140 °C for 30 min. The trimethylsilane-base derivatives were separated on a HP-5MS column. Isotopic enrichment was determined in positive ionization mode by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using a model 6890 gas chromatograph and model 5973 mass spectrometer (Hewlett-Packard Corp., Palo Alto, CA). Selected ion monitoring was conducted at a mass-to-charge ratio m/z 255–257 for thymine, m/z 280–283 for adenine, andm/z 368–371 for guanine. Previous studies indicate that cellular glycine levels influence serine synthesis and that folate-dependent serine synthesis comes at the expense of methionine synthesis. Activation of cSHMT in neuroblastoma by removal of its endogenous inhibitor 5-formylTHF depletes 5-methylTHF pools, impairs homocysteine remethylation, elevates cellular serine levels, and increases the methionine requirement for maximal cell growth (18Girgis S. Suh J.R. Jolivet J. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4729-4734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In other studies, Penafielet al. (24Penafiel R. Galindo J.D. Cremades A. Monserrat F. Biochem. Int. 1990; 22: 649-657PubMed Google Scholar) observed that adult mice injected with high levels of glycine display a 14-fold increase in hepatic glycine concentrations and a 6-fold rise in hepatic serine, suggesting that high levels of glycine were able to drive the direction of the SHMT reaction toward serine synthesis. Additionally, an isotope labeling study by Petzke et al. (25Petzke K.J. Albrecht V. Przybilski H. J. Nutr. 1986; 116: 742-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) showed that the rate of glycine-to-serine conversion is increased in the hepatocytes of rats that are fed glycine-rich diets. Indeed, the clinical manifestations of nonketotic hyperglycinemia may be partly explained by the influence of glycine on cSHMT activity and utilization of methyleneTHF for serine synthesis. Measurements of metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid from nonketotic hyperglycinemia patients revealed elevated glycine and homocysteine, but low normal methionine concentrations (26Van Hove J.L. Lazeyras F. Zeisel S.H. Bottiglieri T. Hyland K. Charles H.C. Gray L. Jaeken J. Kahler S.G. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1998; 21: 799-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, no one has previously systematically examined the effects of cellular glycine levels on folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism. To study the effects of cellular glycine on cSHMT activity and homocysteine remethylation, the cDNA encoding a glycine transporter, GlyT, was transfected into human MCF-7 cells. The transporter is Na+- and Cl−-dependent and functions to clear glycine from synaptic clefts. Because it is a reversible transporter, GlyT equalizes intra- and extracellular glycine concentrations, thereby allowing precise control of intracellular glycine through culture conditions. MCF-7 cells expressing the glycine transporter accumulate ∼10-fold more [3H]glycine when cultured in the presence of NaCl, whereas nontransfected MCF-7 cells do not display any increased glycine accumulation in the presence of NaCl (TableI). Additionally, the transporter can deplete intracellular glycine in cells cultured in the absence of glycine: the concentration of free cellular glycine in MCF-7 cells that express the transporter is reduced by 85% compared with untransfected cells when cultured in the absence of glycine (TableII).Table IGlycine uptake by transfectant MCF-7 cellsCell lineNaClRadioactivityIncrease in uptakecpm-foldMCF-7−1,570MCF-7+1,222<0MCFGlyT Clone 1−2,990MCFGlyTClone 1+27,3599.15MCFGlyT Clone 2−1,519MCFGlyT Clone 2+16,18510.65Transfected MCF-7 cells expressing the Na+/Cl−-dependent glycine transporter were assayed for [2-3H]glycine uptake.

The effect of intracellular glycine on cellular folate one-carbon distribution was determined in MCF-7 and MCFGlyT cells (Fig. 2). 5-methylTHF levels respond to changes in medium glycine concentrations in all cells (Fig.2 A) and are highest at 0 mm glycine and decrease with increasing concentrations of medium glycine. For MCF-7 cells, 5-methylTHF comprises about 40% of total cellular folate when cultured without glycine and decreases to about 25% of total folate at 1 mm glycine in the culture medium. The 5-methylTHF levels are not affected by increases in medium glycine from 1 to 10 mm in these cells. In contrast, 5-methylTHF accounts for up to 55% of total cellular folate in MCFGlyT cells when cultured without glycine, and 5-methylTHF levels decrease nearly linearly as a function of increasing medium glycine from 0 to 10 mm. All decreases in 5-methylTHF levels are accompanied by increases in 10-formylTHF relative concentrations of similar magnitude (Fig. 2 B). The relative concentration of unsubstituted THF did not change with exogenous glycine and was not different between the transfected and nontransfected cells (data not shown). These observations indicate that glycine alters the distribution of cellular one-carbon substituted folate derivatives but does not limit the availability of one-carbon units for cytoplasmic metabolism. The glycine-induced decrease in cellular 5-methylTHF levels indicates that glycine increases cSHMT-catalyzed serine synthesis and thereby increases the enzyme's effectiveness in competing with MTHFR for one-carbon units in the form of 5,10-methyleneTHF (Fig.1). Relative 5-methylTHF levels reach a minimum threshold in wild type cells between 1 and 2 mmexogenous glycine, whereas 5-methylTHF levels decrease nearly linearly in cells expressing GlyT over the range of glycine concentrations tested. This indicates the MCF-7 cells"

The secular decrease in J 2 resulted primarily from the postglacial rebound in the mantle. The present increase, whose geophysical cause(s) are uncertain, thus signifies a large change in global mass distribution with a J 2 effect that considerably overshadows that of mantle rebound."
https://openalex.org/W2060282518,"The vibrational dynamics of the retinal chromophore all-trans–to–13-cis photoisomerization in bacteriorhodopsin has been studied with mid-infrared absorption spectroscopy at high time resolution (about 200 femtoseconds). After photoexcitation of light-adapted bacteriorhodopsin, the transient infrared absorption was probed in a broad spectral region, including vibrations with dominant C–C, C=C, and C=NH stretching mode amplitude. All photoproduct modes, especially those around 1190 reciprocal-centimeters that are indicative for a 13-cis configuration of the chromophore, rise with a time constant of ∼0.5 picosecond. The results presented give direct vibrational-spectroscopic evidence for the isomerization taking place within 0.5 picosecond, as has been suggested by previous optical femtosecond time-resolved experiments but questioned recently by picosecond time-resolved vibrational spectroscopy experiments."

https://openalex.org/W2032648343,"The yeast vacuole plays an important role in zinc homeostasis by storing zinc for later use under deficient conditions, sequestering excess zinc for its detoxification, and buffering rapid changes in intracellular zinc levels. The mechanisms involved in vacuolar zinc sequestration are only poorly characterized. Here we describe the properties of zinc transport systems in yeast vacuolar membrane vesicles. The major zinc transport activities in these vesicles were ATP-dependent, requiring a H+ gradient generated by the V-ATPase for function. One system we identified was dependent on the ZRC1 gene, which encodes a member of the cation diffusion facilitator family of metal transporters. These data are consistent with the proposed role of Zrc1 as a vacuolar zinc transporter. Zrc1-independent activity was also observed that was not dependent on the closely related vacuolar Cot1 protein. Both Zrc1-dependent and independent activities showed a high specificity for Zn2+over other physiologically relevant substrates such as Ca2+, Fe2+, and Mn2+.

Zinc is estimated to be required for the function of more than 3% of the yeast proteome (1Eide D.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), and therefore the cells must possess mechanisms to obtain sufficient quantities of this important nutrient. Although zinc is not redox-active under physiological conditions, excess zinc can be toxic to cells. Zinc toxicity may be mediated via binding of the cation to inappropriate sites in proteins or co-factors. For example, excess zinc can interfere with mitochondrial aconitase activity and impair respiration (2Costello L.C. Liu Y. Franklin R.B. Kennedy M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28875-28881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The essential but potentially toxic nature of zinc necessitates precise homeostatic control mechanisms. InEscherichia coli, zinc homeostasis is accomplished largely through the transcriptional control of zinc uptake and efflux transporters (3Patzer S.I. Hantke K. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1199-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 4Brocklehurst K.R. Hobman J.L. Lawley B. Blank L. Marshall S.J. Brown N.L. Morby A.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Recent studies of the regulatory zinc sensors that control expression of these transporters suggest that E. coli cells strive to maintain essentially no labile zinc in their cytoplasm under steady state growth conditions (5Outten C.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 2001; 292: 2488-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar). Similarly, in eukaryotic cells, labile zinc levels are estimated to be in the low nanomolar range under steady state conditions (6Sensi S.L. Canzoniero L.M., Yu, S.P. Ying H.S. Koh J.Y. Kerchner G.A. Choi D.W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9554-9564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have uncovered many aspects of zinc homeostasis in this eukaryotic organism. One major component is the transcriptional regulation of the Zrt1 and Zrt2 zinc uptake transporters. Expression of these proteins is induced under zinc-limiting conditions by the Zap1 transcriptional activator (7Zhao H. Eide D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5044-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). A second important mechanism of zinc homeostasis is the post-translational inactivation of Zrt1 by high zinc. When zinc-limited cells are transferred to zinc-replete conditions, zinc rapidly accumulates in cells because of the high level expression of the plasma membrane transporters. We refer to this condition as “zinc shock.” In response to zinc shock, Zrt1 is ubiquitinated and removed from the plasma membrane by endocytosis (8Gitan R.S. Lou H. Rodgers J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28617-28624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 9Gitan R.S. Eide D.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This results in a rapid decrease in zinc uptake activity that helps limit zinc overaccumulation under these conditions. Yet another critical mechanism of zinc homeostasis is the sequestration of zinc in the vacuole. Several studies suggest that the vacuole is a storage/detoxification site for excess zinc under steady state high zinc conditions. First, mutations that disrupt vacuolar biogenesis or activity of the V-ATPase, which acidifies the vacuole, are hypersensitive to zinc treatment (10Eide D. Bridgham J.T. Zhong Z. Mattoon J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 11Ramsay L.M. Gadd G.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 152: 293-298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, mutations that disrupt vacuolar accumulation of polyphosphate, a potential zinc-binding component in the vacuole, are also zinc-sensitive (12Nelson N. Perzov N. Cohen A. Hagai K. Padler V. Nelson H. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 89-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,13Ogawa N. DeRisi J. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4309-4321Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Third, several potential zinc transporters, Zrc1, Cot1, and Zrt3, have been implicated in vacuolar zinc sequestration. Zrt3 is a member of the ZIP family, which also includes the Zrt1 and Zrt2 transporters and has been proposed to efflux stored zinc from the vacuole to the cytosol during the transition from high to low zinc (14MacDiarmid C.W. Gaither L.A. Eide D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Zrc1 and Cot1 are members of the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF)1 family, a ubiquitous group of transporter proteins found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (15Nies D.H. Silver S. J. Ind. Microbiol. 1995; 14: 186-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 16Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. BioMetals. 2001; 14: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 17Paulsen I.T. Saier M.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Many CDF proteins have been implicated in zinc efflux or compartmentalization, and Zrc1 and Cot1 are thought to transport zinc into the vacuole. Both proteins have been localized to the vacuole membrane (18Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22181-22187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 19Miyabe S. Izawa S. Inoue Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), although these observations must be interpreted with some caution because they were obtained using cells that overexpressed these proteins. The overexpression of Zrc1 or Cot1 confers zinc tolerance (20Kamizono A. Nishizawa M. Teranishi Y. Murata K. Kimura A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 21Conklin D.S. Culbertson M.R. Kung C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), which in the case of Zrc1 is associated with increased zinc accumulation in a compartment that is not accessible to the Zap1 transcription factor. 2C. W. MacDiarmid and D. Eide, unpublished data. These observations suggest that Zrc1 and Cot1 mediate the sequestration of excess zinc in the vacuole. Consistent with this model, the zrc1 andcot1 mutations are associated with reduced total cellular zinc accumulation and increased zinc sensitivity (14MacDiarmid C.W. Gaither L.A. Eide D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 20Kamizono A. Nishizawa M. Teranishi Y. Murata K. Kimura A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar,22Bloβ T. Clemens S. Nies D.H. Planta. 2002; 214: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).2 Interestingly, although the zinc sensitivity of yeast is significantly increased by the zrc1 mutation, such mutant strains are still tolerant to millimolar concentrations of zinc, which are unlikely to be encountered in the natural environment. Our recent studies suggest that an important physiological role of Zrc1 is to tolerate the rapid influx of zinc that results from exposing zinc-deficient yeast to zinc-replete conditions (zinc shock).2 Despite the transcriptional and post-translational control of plasma membrane zinc transporters, zinc shock still results in the overaccumulation of large quantities of zinc (8Gitan R.S. Lou H. Rodgers J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28617-28624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). TheZRC1 gene is transcriptionally induced by Zap1 in zinc-deficient cells (23Lyons T.J. Gasch A.P. Gaither L.A. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Eide D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 24Miyabe S. Izawa S. Inoue Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and this up-regulation is required to provide tolerance to zinc shock.2 Mutation of theZRC1 gene renders cells extremely sensitive to zinc shock, as does the disruption of ZRC1 induction by Zap1. Hence, the vacuole appears to play a role in buffering cytoplasmic zinc against changes in zinc availability. To fully understand the role of the vacuole in zinc homeostasis, a biochemical characterization of the zinc transporter activities in this compartment is essential. Two previous studies have addressed this issue. Okorokov et al. (25Okorokov L.A. Kulakovskaya T.V. Lichko L.P. Polorotova E.V. FEBS Lett. 1985; 192: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) were the first to assay zinc transport activity in yeast vacuolar vesicles. These investigators characterized a transport system with an apparent K mof 55–170 μm. However, this apparent low affinity for substrate is unlikely to be of physiological significance given the low amounts of labile zinc (i.e. nm) now thought to be present in cells. Similarly, White and Gadd (26White C. Gadd G.M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 727-737Google Scholar) noted zinc transport activity in vacuole vesicles, but this activity was not further described. Because of these considerations, we initiated this study of the biochemical properties of zinc transport activities in vacuolar vesicles. Furthermore, using genetic manipulations in combination with our biochemical assays, we investigated the contribution of the CDF family proteins and the V-ATPase to vacuolar zinc transport. Yeast were routinely grown in YPD or in synthetic defined medium with 2% glucose and necessary auxotrophic supplements. LZM was prepared as described previously (8Gitan R.S. Lou H. Rodgers J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28617-28624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 27Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Low zinc YPD (LZ-YPD) medium was prepared by treating standard YPD medium (1 liter) with 25 g of Chelex 100 resin for 12 h at 4 °C. The resin was removed, and the medium was supplemented with 4 mm MgCl2, 100 μm CaCl2, 25 μmMnCl2, 10 μm FeCl3, and 2 μm CuCl2. LZ-YPD had a zinc content of less than 1 μm as determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (data not shown). Sodium citrate (20 mm, pH 4.2) and EDTA (1 mm) were added to further limit zinc bioavailability, and the medium was filter-sterilized. Cell number/ml of yeast suspensions was determined by measuring the optical density at 600 nm (A 600) and comparing with a standard curve.E. coli and yeast transformations were performed using standard methods. Immunoblot analysis and indirect immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (9Gitan R.S. Eide D.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 14MacDiarmid C.W. Gaither L.A. Eide D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) and Pierce. Affinity purified rabbit Kex2 antibody was a gift of Steve Nothwehr. The ZRC1 gene was amplified from yeast genomic DNA (DY1457) using oligonucleotides designed to include 1000 bp of the promoter and 500 bp of the terminator regions. The resulting DNA fragment was cloned into theEcoRI and PstI sites of pFL38 (28Bonneaud N. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O., Li, G.Y. Labouesse M. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Lacroute F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) to generate YCpZRC1. An epitope-tagged ZRC1 allele was generated by overlap PCR (29Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) adding three copies of the Haemophilus influenzae hemagglutinin (HA) epitope to the C terminus of Zrc1. The PCR product was then inserted into BamHI- andHpaI-digested YCpZRC1 by gap repair to generate YCpZRC1-HA. Yeast strains CM100 (ZRC1 COT1), CM102 (zrc1::HIS3), CM103 (cot1::URA3), and CM104 (zrc1::HIS3 cot1::URA3) were described previously (14MacDiarmid C.W. Gaither L.A. Eide D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). All of the newly constructed strains were isogenic to CM100. CM142 (ZRC1 −HA) was constructed by transformation of CM104 with the insert of YCpZRC1-HA. Transformants were selected by complementation of the zinc-sensitive phenotype of CM104, and the mutations were verified using PCR. The cot1 mutation was removed by backcrossing to a wild-type strain. Yeast strain MM112 (vph1::LEU2 stv1::LYS2) (30Manolson M.F., Wu, B. Proteau D. Taillon B.E. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14064-14074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was a gift of Rob Piper. Yeast vacuoles were prepared using the method of Kakinuma et al. (31Kakinuma Y. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10859-10863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Yeast cells were grown to late log phase in YPD medium with 4% glucose and then washed once with water and once with buffer A (100 mm KPO4 buffer, pH 7.0, 1.2 msorbitol). The cells were resuspended in three times the pellet volume in buffer A with 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1% glucose, and 50 units zymolyase/ml. The cells were incubated for 1–2 h at 30 degrees with gentle shaking. The spheroplasts were washed twice with buffer A and resuspended in 5 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm MES-Tris, pH 6.9, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 12% Ficoll 400). Most cells lysed after resuspension in this buffer, and cell clumps were broken up by 15 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. The lysate was then processed as described previously (31Kakinuma Y. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10859-10863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that membrane wafers were resuspended by repeated pipetting. The final wafer of vacuoles was resuspended in 5 ml of 1× buffer C (10 mm MES-Tris, pH 6.9, 25 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2) and dispersed by repeated pipetting. Vesiculated vacuole membranes were collected by centrifugation at 60,000 × g for 30 min, resuspended in buffer C with 10% glycerol, and frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to storage at −80 °C. The protein content of vacuole preparations was assayed using a Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad). Efforts to reduce the degree of Zrc1 degradation during vesicle preparation using various protease inhibitor mixtures were unsuccessful. Accumulation of65Zn2+ by vacuole vesicles was assayed in 10 mm MES-Tris buffer (pH 6.9) with 4 mmMgCl2 and 25 mm KCl. Vacuole vesicles (routinely 5 μg of protein) were added to 200 μl of this buffer with or without 1 mm ATP and the indicated65Zn2+ concentration and incubated at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by addition of 4.5 ml of cold wash buffer (10 mm MES-Tris, pH 6.9, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm Tris-buffered EDTA) and incubation on ice. The vesicles were collected on nitrocellulose filters (Millipore; pore size, 0.45 μm) and washed three times with 5 ml of cold wash buffer. The radioactivity retained on the filters was quantified in a γ counter. Michaelis-Menten constants were determined by nonlinear interpolation of the data using Prism (version 3.0a for Macintosh, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Adenosine-triphosphatase activity of isolated vacuole membranes was assayed in 10 mm Tris-MES buffer (pH 6.9) containing 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl, and 1 mm Mg2+-ATP. Aliquots of 500 μl of buffer were incubated at 30 °C, and vacuole vesicles (5 μg of protein) were added to start the assay. The assay was terminated by addition of 1 ml of stop buffer (2% H2SO4, 0.5% NH4MoO4, 0.5% SDS) and color developed by the addition of 10 μl of freshly prepared 10% sodium ascorbate. After 10 min of color development, the samples were read at 750 nm against a blank with no protein added. Sodium orthovanadate was prepared by boiling a 100 mm stock of sodium vanadate for 10 min and used immediately. To assay changes in the internal pH of vacuole vesicles, vacuole membranes (10 μg of protein) were added to 1 ml of ATPase assay buffer in a spectrofluorimeter cuvette at 30 °C. 9-Amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine (ACMA) was added to a final concentration of 2 μm. Dye fluorescence was excited by light of wavelength 410 nm, and the emission at 482 nm was continuously recorded using a Hitachi F3010 spectrofluorimeter. When a stable emission signal was obtained, ATP (1 mm) was added, and quenching of the dye fluorescence was recorded. Many genetic studies have implicated the importance of vacuolar zinc transport in zinc homeostasis. To examine this process at a biochemical level, vacuolar vesicles were isolated from yeast cells for in vitro zinc transport studies. The purity of these preparations was assessed by immunoblot analysis using antibodies against marker proteins of known compartments. Compared with whole cell lysates, vacuole vesicles from wild-type cells were enriched ∼4-fold in two vacuolar marker proteins, Cpy and Vma1 (Fig.1). The levels of marker proteins for other compartments such as mitochondria, Golgi, and endoplasmic reticulum, as well as a cytoplasmic enzyme, were at similar or reduced levels in the vacuole fraction. These data indicated that the isolation procedure resulted in a significant enrichment of vacuole vesicles. Similar results were obtained with vesicles isolated fromzrc1 mutant cells (Fig. 1). Experiments using vesicles from this mutant strain will be described later in this report. From previous reports of this isolation procedure, it was known that vacuole membrane vesicles were primarily obtained in the right-side-out orientation, making them suitable for studies of vacuolar cation import (31Kakinuma Y. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10859-10863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5614-5617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observed enrichment of CPY, a lumenal vacuolar protein, indicated that a significant fraction of the vesicles isolated were right-side-out. This conclusion was also supported by our observation that significant V-ATPase activity was detected in nonpermeabilized vesicles (see below). To determine whether vacuole vesicles could accumulate zinc, membranes isolated from a wild-type strain were incubated with radioactive65Zn with or without Mg-ATP as an energy source. Zinc accumulation was assessed over time by collecting the vesicles on nitrocellulose filters, washing them to remove surface-bound zinc, and then measuring the level of accumulated isotope. In the absence of ATP, only a low level of zinc accumulation was observed. In the presence of ATP, however, a high level of zinc uptake activity was detected (Fig.2 A). This ATP-dependent zinc uptake was rapid and essentially complete after 2 min of incubation with 1 μm65Zn. This plateau was likely due to an equilibrium effect (i.e. high lumenal zinc inhibiting additional uptake) because assays using higher concentrations of zinc resulted in longer periods of increasing accumulation and higher final levels of zinc (data not shown). Zinc accumulation was not stimulated by ADP or a nonhydrolyzable analogue of ATP (AMP-PNP), indicating a requirement for hydrolysis of the γ-phosphate of ATP. That the vesicle-associated zinc was actually in the vesicle lumen rather than bound to the membrane surface was confirmed using pyrithione, a zinc ionophore. The addition of pyrithione to vesicles after zinc accumulation caused a rapid decrease in vesicle-associated 65Zn. This effect was not simply due to pyrithione chelating and removing surface-bound zinc, because the membrane-impermeable chelator EDTA was routinely used to wash the vesicles after 65Zn treatment and had no effect on the pyrithione-accessible zinc. These observations indicated that65Zn was accumulated within a membrane-bound compartment. Because pyrithione treatment caused a net release of accumulated zinc, these data also indicated that the vesicles were capable of generating a zinc concentration gradient. The accumulation of ions and metabolites in yeast vacuoles is often mediated by secondary active transport systems, which drive solute transport using the stored energy of a proton concentration gradient generated by the vacuolar V-type H+-ATPase (33Klionsky D.J. Herman P.K. Emr S.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 266-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The vacuole vesicles isolated in this study were capable of generating a proton gradient when supplied with ATP, as determined by quenching of the pH-sensitive fluorescent indicator, ACMA (Fig. 2 B). Generation of this proton gradient was also dependent on a hydrolyzable ATP substrate as was observed for the zinc uptake assays. To determine whether this proton gradient was required for zinc uptake, the effect of compounds that dissipate pH gradients was examined (Table I). As a control, the effect of these inhibitors on total ATPase activity of the extracts and vesicle acidification was also determined. Addition of the protonophore FCCP at the start of the zinc uptake assay severely inhibited this activity. This compound also effectively dissipated the proton gradient generated by adding ATP to ACMA-treated vesicles (Fig.2 B). Consistent with its mode of action, FCCP did not inhibit ATPase activity. In fact, FCCP stimulated this activity, an effect that is consistent with the uncoupling of ATP hydrolysis and vesicle acidification mediated by this inhibitor. Nigericin, an ionophore that dissipates proton gradients via K+/H+ exchange, also inhibited zinc uptake and stimulated ATPase activity. We also tested the effect of valinomycin, a potassium ionophore that dissipates gradients of K+ and electrical potential gradients but does not affect proton gradients. Valinomycin treatment did not inhibit zinc uptake, indicating that the uptake was not dependent on a K+ gradient nor an electrical potential gradient generated by ATPase activity. The above observations indicated that the ATP-dependent accumulation of zinc by vacuole vesicles required a proton concentration gradient. As expected, nigericin dissipated the vesicle proton gradient, whereas valinomycin did not (data not shown).Table IEffect of inhibitors on zinc uptake and ATPase activity of vacuole vesiclesTreatment65Zn uptake rateanmol/mg protein/min.Relative 65Zn uptake ratebPercentage of + ATP value.ATPase specific acitvitycnmol Pi/μg protein/min.Relative ATPase specific activitydPercentage of + ATP value.−ATP0.8 ± 0.25.0 ± 1.0NANA+ATP16.8 ± 0.7100.0 ± 4.21.6 ± 0.1100.0 ± 3.0FCCP4.0 ± 0.723.6 ± 4.04.6 ± 0.1295.2 ± 1.6Nigericin2.4 ± 0.214.5 ± 1.34.1 ± 0.1260.2 ± 8.3Valinomycin17.8 ± 0.3105.7 ± 1.51.6 ± 0.1100.2 ± 2.4Oligomycin13.4 ± 0.980.0 ± 5.01.2 ± 0.175.1 ± 0.4Concanamycin A3.1 ± 0.218.5 ± 1.00.6 ± 0.140.0 ± 2.1Vanadate16.4 ± 0.597.3 ± 3.20.4 ± 0.126.4 ± 3.0Zinc uptake assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” (1-min incubation with 0.5 μm65Zn2+).

To determine which enzyme was responsible for generating this proton gradient, we tested the effect of inhibitors of the V-type H+-ATPase (concanamycin A), the P-type H+-ATPases (vanadate), and the mitochondrial F1Fo H+-ATPase (oligomycin) on zinc uptake and ATPase activity (Table I). Of the three inhibitors used, concanamycin A most strongly inhibited zinc accumulation. Concanamycin A at a concentration of 100 nm or above maximally inhibited ∼60% of the ATPase activity in yeast vacuole preparations. The remaining concanamycin A-insensitive ATPase activity is likely due to vacuolar phosphohydrolases or from contamination of the preparations with other organelles (Fig. 1). ATP hydrolysis by this concanamycin A-insensitive activity was not coupled to vesicle acidification; 100 nm concanamycin A completely prevented the acidification of vacuole vesicles as determined using ACMA (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, oligomycin and vanadate had far lesser effects on vesicle acidification. Taken together, these data indicate that ATP-dependent zinc accumulation in vacuole vesicles is mediated by secondary active transport systems that are dependent on the proton gradient generated by the V-ATPase. Further evidence for the involvement of the V-ATPase in zinc transport was obtained by assays of vesicles from a vph1 stv1 mutant strain, which lack V-ATPase activity because of loss-of-function mutations in the two V-ATPase 100-kDa subunits (see below). Intracellular glutathione concentrations are in the millimolar range, suggesting that much of the labile cytosolic zinc in cells may be present in the form of zinc-glutathione complexes. Surprisingly, high levels of reduced glutathione (1 mm GSH with 1 μm65Zn, data not shown) did not inhibit ATP-dependent zinc uptake in vitrodespite the ability of glutathione to bind zinc with high affinity (34Krezel A. Wojciech B. Acta Biochim. Pol. 1999; 46: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These results suggest that zinc-GSH complexes may be a labile source of Zn2+ for transport in vivo. The observation that vacuole vesicles contained zinc transport activity led us to investigate which proteins might be responsible for this activity. Two obvious candidates were the CDF proteins Zrc1 and Cot1; both proteins are likely to be zinc transporters, although direct evidence supporting this hypothesis has not been reported. To determine whether Zrc1 contributes to zinc uptake by vacuole vesicles, we first confirmed the subcellular location of this protein. Zrc1 had previously been localized to the vacuole membrane when overexpressed (18Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol.

The protein called Hop serves as an adaptor protein for hsp70 and hsp90 and is thought to optimize their functional cooperation. Here we characterize the assembly of the hsp70-Hop-hsp90 complex and reveal interactions that cause conformational changes between the proteins in the complex. We found that hsp40 plays an integral role in the assembly by enhancing the binding of hsp70 to the Hop complex. This is accomplished by stimulating the conversion of hsp70-ATP to hsp70-ADP, the hsp70 conformation favored for Hop binding. The hsp70-Hop-hsp90 complex is highly dynamic, as has been observed previously for hsp90 in its interaction with client proteins. Nonetheless, hsp90 binds with high affinity to Hop (K d = 90 nm), and this binding is not affected by hsp70. hsp70 binds with lower affinity to Hop (K d = 1.3 μm) on its own, but this affinity is increased (K d = 250 nm) in the presence of hsp90. hsp90 also reduces the number of hsp70 binding sites on the Hop dimer from two sites in the absence of hsp90 to one site in its presence. Hop can inhibit the ATP binding and p23 binding activity of hsp90, yet this can be reversed if hsp70 is present in the complex. Taken together, our results suggest that the assembly of hsp70-Hop-hsp90 complexes is selective and influences the conformational state of each protein.

An in vitro chaperoning system has been developed that is capable of assembling a steroid receptor complex wherein the receptor has an active ligand binding domain. This system consists of five proteins (hsp40, hsp70, Hop, hsp90, and p23) and ATP (9Kosano H. Stensgard B. Charlesworth M.C. McMahon N. Toft D. J. Biol.

Murphy P.J. Shewach D.S. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1109-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The initiation of the pathway involves the binding of hsp40 to the receptor (11Hernandez M.P. Chadli A. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11873-11881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This is followed by the binding of hsp70 to the receptor through an ATP-dependent mechanism. The receptor complex with hsp40 and hsp70 then assembles with Hop and hsp90 to form what has generally been referred to as the intermediate complex (16Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1418-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 17Smith D.F. Toft D.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 4-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This intermediate complex containing hsp70, Hop, and hsp90 is then converted to a mature complex containing hsp90 and p23, and at this stage the ligand binding domain of the receptor is properly folded so as to be able to bind hormone.We were interested in examining in detail the components of the intermediate complex that is characterized by the binding of Hop to both hsp70 and hsp90 to make a three-component complex. Optimal hsp90 binding to steroid receptors occurs when a continuous supply of ATP is provided, as the activities of hsp90 are regulated by ATP binding and hydrolysis (6Grenert J.P. Johnson B.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17525-17533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 7Obermann W.M. Sondermann H. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Hartl F.U. J.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4829-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). When the drug geldanamycin binds to its ATP binding domain, hsp90 is unable to undergo conformational changes needed for its activities (18Smith D.F. Whitesell L. Nair S.C. Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6804-6812Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Similarly, when ATP is limiting, some hsp90 binding to receptors is lost, and no binding of immunophilins or p23 is observed. Under these conditions, most of the receptor is retained in the intermediate complex, bound to hsp70, Hop, and hsp90 (16Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1418-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar).As its name (hsp-organizingprotein) suggests, an important feature of Hop is that it will link hsp70 and hsp90 together (12Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Honore B. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 682-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the binding of Hop to hsp70 and hsp90 occurs directly with pure proteins and without the need for ATP hydrolysis (19Johnson B.D. Schumacher R.J. Ross E.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3679-3686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Hop alone does not possess any chaperone activity in protein refolding assays, unlike hsp70 and hsp90 (20Bose S. Weikl T. Bugl H. Buchner J. Science. 1996; 274: 1715-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 21Freeman B.C. Toft D.O. Morimoto R.I. Science. 1996; 274: 1718-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), yet Hop is nonetheless required for optimal receptor-hsp90 heterocomplex assembly (9Kosano H. Stensgard B. Charlesworth M.C.

Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3638-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), is almost entirely complexed with hsp90 in similar hsp90 (hsp82)-Hop (STI1)-hsp70 (Ssa) complexes (25Chang H.C. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24983-24988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been further observed that all of Hop in rabbit reticulocyte lysate is immunoadsorbed with hsp90 (26Silverstein A.M. Galigniana M.D. Kanelakis K.C. Radanyi C. Renoir J.M. Pratt W.B. J. Biol.

Hop contains several tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs), protein motifs that have been shown to mediate specific protein interactions in numerous cellular contexts. Specifically, Hop has two TPR domains that have been implicated in its binding to hsp70 and hsp90. The N-terminal TPR1 domain binds to the C terminus of hsp70, and the central TPR2 domain binds to a TPR acceptor site in the C terminus of hsp90 (12Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Honore B.

In order to gain insights into the dynamics of hsp70 and hsp90 in the intermediate complex, we sought to characterize the assembly of the hsp70-Hop-hsp90 complex. We examined the role of hsp40 in this process and found that it was integral to the assembly of this multichaperone complex. Also, the behavior of each protein appears to be influenced by interaction with the other proteins in this complex.DISCUSSIONThe highly coordinated interactions of several molecular chaperones, including hsp70 and hsp90, are required for the folding and conformational regulation of a variety of proteins in eukaryotic cells, such as steroid hormone receptors and many other signal transduction regulators (14Pratt W.B.

Chem. 1998; 273: 35194-35200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) and is thought to optimize their functional cooperation, despite the fact that Hop does not have any measurable chaperoning activity on its own (20Bose S. Weikl T. Bugl H. Buchner J. Science. 1996; 274: 1715-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 21Freeman B.C. Toft D.O. Morimoto R.I. Science. 1996; 274: 1718-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Hop (Sti1) is not an essential protein in yeast, but its deletion clearly reduces the functioning of steroid receptors in yeast model systems (60Chang H.C. Nathan D.F. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In vitro, Hop has been shown to be necessary for optimal chaperoning of hsp90 client proteins such as the glucocorticoid and progesterone receptors (9Kosano H. Stensgard B. Charlesworth M.C. McMahon N. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32973-32979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 61Morishima Y. Kanelakis K.C. Silverstein A.M. Dittmar K.D. Estrada L.

Wang X. J. Virol. 2001; 76: 269-279Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In this pathway, wherein the receptor is chaperoned to a conformation that is capable of binding hormone, PR first forms a complex with hsp40 and hsp70 (11Hernandez M.P. Chadli A. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11873-11881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This PR complex then assembles with Hop and hsp90 to form what has generally been referred to as the intermediate complex (16Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1418-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 17Smith D.F. Toft D.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 4-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although hsp90 is a part of this complex, the receptor is still unable to bind hormone, since this occurs when the intermediate complex is converted to a mature complex containing bound p23.Previous studies have suggested that the proteins studied here constitute a chaperone machine or “foldosome” (14Pratt W.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 420-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) that is highly dynamic and may vary in composition according to what step in the chaperoning process it is involved in at any particular time. It has been seen in other studies that hsp40 is a component of the hsp90-Hop-hsp70 foldosome complex isolated from rabbit reticulocyte lysate with antibody against Hop (10Dittmar K.D. Banach M. Galigniana M.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7358-7366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), although we did not see that in our studies. Here, we have concentrated on the study of a purified protein system.Through two separate domains, Hop can bind to both hsp70 and hsp90 simultaneously, and it is believed to act as an adaptor to promote the binding of hsp90 to preexisting early PR complexes (23Smith D.F.

We looked in detail at the hsp70-Hop-hsp90 complex under conditions independent of a client protein substrate such as the progesterone receptor. Our results indicate that Hop interacts differently with hsp70 and hsp90 in the complex. We propose three reactions that should take place in the cell leading to the assembly of hsp70-Hop-hsp90 complexes, as shown in Fig. 11. These reactions agree with previous models of the hsp90 chaperoning pathway while adding more detail to the individual and collective interactions of hsp70 and hsp90 with Hop. The results also point out a novel role for hsp40 in the assembly of the hsp70-Hop-hsp90 complex.In regard to reaction 1 in our proposed model (Fig. 11), it has been seen that a majority of the Hop in rabbit reticulocyte lysate is bound to hsp90 (26Silverstein A.M.

This affinity (K d = 90 nm) is substantially higher than that measured previously with calorimetric isothermal titration using 12-mer peptides for sequences corresponding to the interaction sites between Hop and hsp90 (31Scheufler C.

In that study, the affinity between Hop and hsp90 (K d = 6 μm) may have been lower than the one we measured, because the affinity was only between the two peptides, as opposed to the full-length proteins that were used in our study. This suggests that there may be other regions of Hop and/or hsp90 that are bound or modified upon their interaction with each other and with hsp70 and hsp40 that may increase their affinity for one another.The interaction between Hop and hsp90 does not depend on nucleotide to form (Fig. 1 B). Further, both Hop (20Bose S. Weikl T. Bugl H. Buchner J. Science. 1996; 274: 1715-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 50Prodromou C. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Woolfson D.N. Regan L. Panaretou B. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 754-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) and hsp90 are known to be dimeric (51Nemoto T. Ohara-Nemoto Y. Ota M. Takagi T. Yokoyama K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and our results indicate that they interact with each other as dimers. Importantly, the interaction between Hop and hsp90 is a highly dynamic one (Fig. 6). This high affinity interaction involves rapid dissociation and reassociation of the proteins (Fig.5 A). In the cell, both hsp90 and Hop are abundant proteins. Yet, hsp90 exists at higher concentrations than Hop, and thus it is likely that essentially all of the Hop is in a complex with hsp90.The binding of hsp70 to Hop is distinct from that of hsp90 and Hop. In contrast to hsp90, there is a dramatic inhibitory influence of ATP on this binding (Fig. 1 B). Further, since hsp70 has a high affinity for ATP, its prevalent form in cells is likely to be hsp70-ATP. Thus, hsp40 plays an essential role in facilitating the hsp70-Hop interaction as shown in reaction 2 (Fig. 11). It is the J domain of hsp40 that plays a critical role (Fig. 2 B), although it is not known from these studies whether it is both necessary and sufficient. The binding of purified hsp70 to Hop is influenced by hsp40 even in the absence of added ATP. However, ATP-agarose affinity chromatography is a key purification step that results in the saturation of hsp70 with ATP, and this bound nucleotide must be dissociated or hydrolyzed before the hsp70 is able to bind Hop. In the cell, there may be very little free hsp70 in the ADP-bound state, but this would be generated when hsp70 is involved in chaperoning substrate proteins. As such, the ATP hydrolysis activity of hsp70 can be stimulated by either interaction with hsp40 or with the substrate protein or most likely by both.In the final step of hsp70-Hop-hsp90 complex formation, the prevalent complex of hsp90-Hop would bind the less prevalent hsp70-ADP, as shown in reaction 3 (Fig. 11). It seems unlikely that hsp70 would bind separately to Hop alone because of the lower affinity of this interaction and the low abundance of free Hop. It is this three-protein complex, hsp70-Hop-hsp90, that has been observed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (23Smith D.F. Sullivan W.P. Marion T.N. Zaitsu K. Madden B. McCormick D.J. Toft D.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) as well as in yeast (25Chang H.C. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24983-24988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies indicate that Hop not only bridges the interaction between hsp90 and hsp70 but may indeed also change conformation during this assembly process. These structural changes are suggested by the fact that both the affinity and stoichiometry of hsp70 to Hop are influenced by the binding of hsp90. We observed that the binding of hsp70 to Hop is enhanced 5-fold by the presence of hsp90. Thus, it is likely that hsp90 alters the conformation of Hop to increase its affinity for hsp70. An alternative possibility is that the bound hsp90 also provides contact sites for hsp70 binding. We have not observed any binding of hsp90 to hsp70 directly, in the absence of Hop. However, such an interaction has been suggested by chemical cross-linking studies (27Murphy P.J. Kanelakis K.C. Galigniana M.D. Morishima Y. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30092-30098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and has been observed directly with proteins from neurospora (64Freitag D.G. Ouimet P.M. Girvitz T.L. Kapoor M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10221-10229Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).It is very interesting to look at our results in the context of what is known about Hop domain structure, particularly in how it relates to hsp70 and hsp90 binding. Hop contains multiple TPRs, with separate TPR domains determining its binding to hsp70 and hsp90. TPR domains are protein motifs that are composed of loosely conserved 34-amino acid sequences that are repeated anywhere from 1 to 16 times per domain. TPR protein domains were originally identified in components of the anaphase-promoting complex (65Sikorski R.S. Boguski M.S. Goebl M. Hieter P. Cell. 1990; 60: 307-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 66Hirano T. Kinoshita N. Morikawa K. Yanagida M. Cell. 1990; 60: 319-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Since then, TPR domains have been shown to mediate specific protein interactions in numerous cellular contexts (67Blatch G.L. Lassle M. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 932-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). The highly conserved structure of the TPR fold is consistent among a number of x-ray structures of different TPR domains (67Blatch G.L. Lassle M. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 932-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Each motif forms a pair of antiparallel α-helices. These structures are further arranged in a tandem array to form a superhelical structure that encloses a central groove (67Blatch G.L. Lassle M. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 932-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar).Hop contains three TPR domains, each composed of three TPR motifs (31Scheufler C. Brinker A. Bourenkov G. Pegoraro S. Moroder L. Bartunik H. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Cell. 2000; 101: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). The N-terminal TPR domain, called TPR1, has been specifically implicated in the interaction with hsp70 (12Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Honore B. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 682-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lassle M. Blatch G.L. Kundra V. Takatori T. Zetter B.R. J. Biol.

J. 2000; 345: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast, two regions of Hop spanning the middle and C-terminal domains, called TPR2A and TPR2B, have been shown to be critical for the interaction with hsp90 (12Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Honore B. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 682-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Prodromou C. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Woolfson D.N. Regan L. Panaretou B. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 754-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Deletion mutagenesis has suggested that the C-terminal sequence motif, which is highly conserved in all hsp70s and hsp90s of the eukaryotic cytosol, has an important role in TPR-mediated cofactor binding (28Lassle M.

Biol. 1998; 18: 6238-6244Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In fact, TPR1 specifically recognizes the C-terminal seven amino acids of hsp70 (PTIEEVD), whereas TPR2A recognizes the C-terminal five residues of hsp90 (MEEVD) (31Scheufler C. Brinker A. Bourenkov G. Pegoraro S. Moroder L. Bartunik H. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Cell. 2000; 101: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar, 71Chen S. Sullivan W.P. Toft D.O. Smith D.F. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 118-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). There is some overlap in the recognition sites for hsp70 and hsp90 on Hop, at least when using peptide fragments of the proteins (72Brinker A. Scheufler C. von Der Mulbe F. Fleckenstein B. Herrmann C. Jung G. Moarefi I. Hartl F.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19265-19275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This supports a model wherein there may be some hsp70 binding to the hsp90 site on Hop in the absence of hsp90, a situation which may or may not have physiological significance.There are two possibilities for the extra hsp70 binding to Hop that is observed in the absence of hsp90. First, hsp70 could be binding to the hsp90 site on Hop. In the absence of hsp90, hsp70 may have been able to bind to the TPR2 region normally reserved for hsp90, albeit with a relatively lower affinity than hsp90 binding, yet when hsp90 is present that site is no longer available for hsp70 binding. Second, since Hop is a dimer (50Prodromou C. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Woolfson D.N. Regan L. Panaretou B. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 754-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), there may be two sites for hsp70, but one is conformationally altered by hsp90 binding. The idea of interdomain interaction in Hop has been suggested before in the context of mutations in C-terminal DP motif of Hop that disrupt the interaction with hsp70 (59Chen S. Smith D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35194-35200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the binding of the hsp90 to the TPR2A and TPR2B domains influences the conformation of the TPR1 domain to enhance the binding of hsp70 to Hop by increasing its affinity yet reducing the contact areas where hsp70 is able to bind. This provides additional selectivity for hsp70 binding to Hop-"

The purpose of this investigation was to identify new classes of potent CFTR activators. A collection of 60,000 diverse drug-like compounds was screened at 10 μmtogether with a low concentration of forskolin (0.5 μm) in Fisher rat thyroid epithelial cells co-expressing human CFTR and a green fluorescent protein-based Cl− sensor. Primary screening yielded 57 strong activators (greater activity than reference compound apigenin), most of which were unrelated in chemical structure to known CFTR activators, and 284 weaker activators. Secondary analysis of the strong activators included analysis of CFTR specificity, forskolin requirement, transepithelial short-circuit current, activation kinetics, dose response, toxicity, and activation mechanism. Three compounds, the most potent being a dihydroisoquinoline, activated CFTR by elevating cellular cAMP, probably by phosphodiesterase inhibition. Fourteen compounds activated CFTR without cAMP elevation or phosphatase inhibition, suggesting direct CFTR interaction. The most potent compounds had tetrahydrocarbazol, hydroxycoumarin, and thiazolidine core structures. These compounds induced CFTR Cl− currents rapidly (<5 min) with Kd down to 200 nm and were CFTR-selective, reversible, and nontoxic.

Mutations in CFTR that alter its biogenesis, cellular processing, and/or intrinsic transport function cause the hereditary lethal disease cystic fibrosis (CF). Activators of CFTR at the plasma membrane may function by elevating cytosolic cAMP (promoting CFTR phosphorylation), inhibiting phosphatase activity (blocking CFTR dephosphorylation), and/or interacting directly with CFTR (1Schultz B.D.

Using lead-based combinatorial synthesis, we recently identified improved flavone-type CFTR activators; the most potent had a 7,8-benzoflavone core structure (13Galietta L.J.V. Springsteel M.F. Eda M. Niedzinski E.J., By, K. Haddadin M.J. Kurth M.J. Nantz M.H. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19723-19728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The few classes of known CFTR activators were identified in a manner that did not involve an extensive or systematic search of natural or synthetic drug-like compounds. Given the complexity of CFTR and its interactions and the lack of systematic searches for activators, we postulated that there should exist undiscovered chemical classes of CFTR activators, possibly with greater potency than existing activators. The purpose of this investigation was to identify and characterize novel, rapidly acting activators of wild-type human CFTR. Such activators could provide information about CFTR activating mechanisms and might activate some CF-causing CFTR mutants, such as G551D-CFTR, that are processed normally but have reduced intrinsic Cl− permeability. We postulated that acute activators of wild-type CFTR might also activate the most common CF-causing mutant, ΔPhe508-CFTR, in synergy with compounds or maneuvers that correct its cellular misprocessing. Further, based on the paradigm established for small molecule correction of misprocessed V2-receptor mutants causing nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (14Morello J.P. Salahpour A. Laperriere A. Bernier V. Arthus M.F. Lonergan M. Petaja-Repo U. Angers S. Morin D. Bichet D.G. Bouvier M. J. Clin.

Our approach to identifying new classes of CFTR activators involved high-throughput screening of diverse drug-like compound collections. For these studies, automated screening instrumentation was set up, and procedures were established for rapid quantitative screening of individual compounds in a 96-well plate format. The primary screen was designed to identify CFTR activators that were effective without and in synergy with cAMP activators, the latter mimicking the normal physiological response. The primary screen identified more than 50 strong CFTR activators, most of which were unrelated chemically to known CFTR activators. The activators were subjected to extensive secondary analysis. Novel activators were identified that strongly activated CFTR Cl− conductance at concentrations well under 1 μm and without elevation of cAMP, as well as compounds that activated the CF-causing mutants G551D-CFTR and ΔPhe508-CFTR. Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) cells stably co-expressing human CFTR (wild-type, or mutants G551D or ΔPhe508) and the yellow fluorescent protein YFP-H148Q were cultured on plastic in Coon's modified F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin as described previously (13Galietta L.J.V.

For fluorescence assays, cells were plated using a LabSystems multidrop dispenser into black 96-well microplates with clear plastic bottoms (Corning-Costar 3904) at 30,000 cells/well. For Ussing chamber experiments, FRT cells were transferred to Snapwell permeable supports (Corning-Costar) at 500,000 cells/insert. Human bronchial epithelial cells were cultured on plastic as described previously (16Galietta L.J.V. Musante L. Romio L. Caruso U. Fantasia A. Gazzolo A. Romano L. Sacco O. Rossi G.A. Varesio L.

For short-circuit current measurements, the cells were plated on Snapwell inserts (500,000 cells/insert) and allowed to differentiate in a hormone-supplemented medium (16Galietta L.J.V. Musante L. Romio L. Caruso U. Fantasia A. Gazzolo A. Romano L. Sacco O. Rossi G.A. Varesio L. Zegarra-Moran O. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L917-L923PubMed Google Scholar). Maximally diverse compound collections were obtained as 10 mm stock solutions in Me2SO from ChemBridge (50,000 compounds) and ChemDiv (10,000 compounds) (both in San Diego, CA). The compounds were drug-like with average molecular mass of ∼450 daltons, good Me2SO and water solubility, and purity > 95%. Secondary plates for screening (1 mm compounds) were prepared by 10-fold dilutions with Me2SO. Screening was carried out on a customized apparatus (SAGIAN, Beckman) containing a 3-m rail Optimized Robot for Chemical Analysis that integrates the following robot-accessible instruments on a 4 × 2-m optical table: (a) SAGIAN 180 CO2 incubator (Forma Scientific), which holds 180 standard microplates in a storage carousel; (b) Elx405-Select plate washer (Bio-Tek Instruments) with valve option and vacuum-sensing/waste alert for complex automated wash cycles; (c) SAGIAN MPS-8 CS incubator (holds eight standard microplates at 4–37 ± 1 °C); (d) SAGIAN shaker (six plate positions, frequency range 40–1100 rpm with variable amplitude); (e) Biomek 2000 liquid handling work station (installed with four positions to hold tip boxes with automatic air locks and six positions for microplates and liquid reservoirs, and MP 20 and MP 200 8-channel tip tools for liquid transfer); (f) SAGIAN carousel (holding 40 pipette tip boxes and 90 microplates); (g) SAGIAN bar code reader; (h) SAGIAN microplate lidding station with automatic vacuum control of six suction cups; (i) two FluoStar fluorescence plate readers (BMG Lab Technologies), each equipped with two-syringe pumps and HQ500/20X (500 ± 10 nm) excitation and HQ535/30M (535 ± 15 nm) emission filters (Chroma). The system was integrated and automated using SAMI version 3.3 software (Beckman Coulter) (Fig. 1 A). To set up the assay, microplates containing cultured cells were loaded into a carousel in the CO2 incubator set at 37 °C, 90% humidity, 5% CO2. Compound plates (bar-coded) containing 1 mm test compound in Me2SO in each well were loaded on 18-shelf carriers in the carousel. Each compound plate contained 80 different compounds, with the first and last columns used for negative (Me2SO alone) and positive (1–25 mm apigenin) controls, respectivelty. MP20 tip boxes (E & K Scientific) were loaded on eight-shelf carriers in the carousel. In each assay cycle, the robot retrieved an assay plate from the CO2 incubator, and each well was washed four times in the plate washer by repeated dispensing and aspirating 200 μl of PBS, leaving 50 μl of PBS after the final aspiration. The assay plate was then incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in the SAGIAN MPS-8 CS incubator. During the incubation, the robot transported a compound plate and pipette tip box to the liquid handling work station. After the 15-min incubation, the plate containing cells was transported to the liquid handling work station and 0.5 μl of each compound (to give final 10 μm compound concentration) was added to each well with two rounds of side mixing. The plate was then shaken for 30 s at 200 rpm and placed in one of the two fluorescence plate readers. Each assay consisted of a continuous 14-s read (5 points/s) with 2 s before solution addition and 12 s after injection of 165 μl of an I−-containing solution (PBS with 100 mmCl− replaced by I−). At 22 s before each fluorescence reading, 10 μl of PBS containing forskolin (0.5 μm final concentration) was added. After assays on a full plate were completed, data were stored and the plate was discarded. All operations were integrated so that both plate readers were occupied >80% of the time as transport, incubation, and liquid transfer operations took place simultaneously. Custom software was developed for analysis of fluorescence data from the plate readers. The software was developed using Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications and was integrated with Microsoft Excel software. The calculated results were entered into a relational database (Microsoft Access) that managed data for each of the compounds for efficient analysis and tabulation. For each data curve, initial fluorescence was determined by averaging 10 time points (over 2 s) before I− solution addition and subtracting background (generally <10%). A third-order polynomial was fitted to the final 11.5 s of the data and used to extrapolate the initial slope (just after I− addition). Fluorescence slopes normalized for initial fluorescence (proportional to d[I−]/dt) were computed and stored in the data base together with identification codes (from bar code reader). cAMP activity was measured using the BIOTRAK enzymatic immunoassay (Amersham Biosciences). FRT cells expressing CFTR were cultured in 96-well plates. After washing and incubation in PBS, cells were incubated for 10 min with compounds and then lysed. Lysates were assayed for cAMP content in triplicate according to the manufacturer's instructions. Phosphatase activity was determined using a nonradioactive assay kit (Promega) as described previously (13Galietta L.J.V. Springsteel M.F. Eda M. Niedzinski E.J., By, K. Haddadin M.J. Kurth M.J. Nantz M.H. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19723-19728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Briefly, an homogenate of CFTR-expressing FRT cells (5 μg of protein per reaction) was incubated with the phosphorylated peptide substrate provided in the kit for 30 min at 37 °C. Released phosphate was measured colorimetrically at 620 nm. Cell toxicity was assayed by the sulforhodamine B method (13Galietta L.J.V. Springsteel M.F. Eda M. Niedzinski E.J., By, K. Haddadin M.J. Kurth M.J. Nantz M.H. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19723-19728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed on days 7–9 for FRT cells expressing wild-type or ΔPhe508 CFTR and on days 10–12 for human bronchial epithelial cells. The Snapwell inserts were mounted in an Ussing chamber system (Vertical diffusion chamber; Costar). For FRT cells, the basolateral solution contained 130 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.3, and 10 mm glucose. For the apical side, this solution was modified by replacing half of the NaCl with sodium gluconate and increasing CaCl2 to 2 mm to compensate for calcium buffering caused by gluconate. Both hemichambers were bubbled with air, and measurements were performed at 37 °C. The basolateral membrane was permeabilized with 250 μg/ml amphotericin B. For human bronchial epithelial cells, both apical and basolateral chambers contained 126 mm NaCl, 0.38 mmKH2PO4, 2.1 mmK2HPO4, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 24 mm NaHCO3, and 10 mm glucose (basolateral membrane not permeabilized). Solutions were continuously bubbled with air (FRT cells) or with 5% CO2, 95% air (bronchial cells) during experiments. The hemichambers were connected to a DVC-1000 voltage clamp (World Precision Instruments) via Ag/AgCl electrodes and 1 m KCl agar bridges. Short-circuit current was digitized and recorded. The primary screen of 60,000 diverse compounds was designed to identify compounds that activated CFTR when added alone as well as compounds that required mild elevation of cytosolic cAMP. As depicted in Fig. 1 B, individual test compounds at 10 μmconcentration were added to one well of a 96-well plate 15 min before assay, and forskolin (0.5 μm) was added 22 s before assay. Each assay consisted of recording base-line fluorescence for 2 s followed by rapid addition of an I−-containing solution to drive I− entry into cells. The time course of decreasing YFP fluorescence was monitored over 12 s to give quantitative information about I− influx rates. The low concentration of forskolin produced little activation of CFTR by itself (<10% of maximal activity measured at 10 μmforskolin). Fig. 2 A shows results from a representative 96-well plate. The first column of wells in each plate contained negative and positive controls in which different concentrations of the reference activator apigenin were added. The remaining wells contained test compounds. The plate shown in Fig.2 A contained two wells (indicated by asterisks) in which there was increased I− entry. Fig. 2 Bshows original fluorescence curves for the apigenin dose response, along with representative inactive compounds, moderate activators, and strong activators. Fig. 2 C summarizes the rates of I− entry for the 60,000 test compounds. For reference, the averaged rates of I− entry were 0.01, 0.021, 0.19, and 1.0 mm/s for apigenin concentrations of 0, 1, 5, and 25 μm, respectively. The vast majority of compounds (59,659 of 60,000) had no significant effect (< 0.08 mm/s) on the rate of I− entry. Fifty-seven compounds, referred to as “strong activators,” increased I− entry to >0.5 mm/s, and 284 compounds, referred to as “weak activators,” increased I− entry to 0.08–0.5 mm/s. The strong activators were further analyzed, initially for CFTR specificity. Repeat fluorescence assay on all 57 strong activators (at 10 μm) confirmed the initial data. None of the strong activators increased I− entry in the fluorescence assay performed using CFTR null cells (FRT cells transfected with YFP-H148Q alone). As shown in Fig. 2 D, some of the strong activators stimulated CFTR-dependent I− entry only in the presence of a small concentration of forskolin (CFTRact-11 shown as one example; others are CFTRact-01, -05, -07, and -10), whereas others (e.g., CFTRact-16; others are CFTRact-02, -03, -04, -06, -08, -09, -13, and -15) required forskolin for only maximal activation (see Fig.3 for compound structures). Transepithelial Cl− current was measured in CFTR-expressing FRT cells grown on porous supports to select a subset of the 57 strong activators identified by the fluorescence assay that strongly increased Cl− conductance at 1 μm. Each compound was tested at 1 and 2 μm concentrations after addition of 0.5 μm forskolin, which itself produced a small increase in short-circuit current. Fig. 3 A shows maximal short-circuit current stimulated by 20 μmforskolin (left curve) and the much smaller current produced by 0.5 μm forskolin and 1–5 μm apigenin (second curve). Under these conditions, 17 of the compounds gave strong CFTR Cl− currents (>75 μA/cm2at 2 μm) and were selected for further characterization (representative data shown for CFTRact-05, CFTRact-07, and CFTRact-09). In each case, the increase in short-circuit current was inhibited by the CFTR blocker glibenclamide. Fig. 3 B shows the chemical structures of these 17 compounds. Compound CFTRact-01 has a xanthine core structure, whereas the core structures of the other 16 compounds are unrelated to those of known CFTR activators. The structures of many of the remaining 30 strong activators and 284 weaker activators identified in the fluorescence assay were similar to those of the 17 compounds in Fig. 3 B. The 17 compounds were further analyzed for cAMP induction, phosphatase inhibition, dose response, activation mechanism, and reversibility. Fig. 4 A summarizes cellular cAMP content after incubation of cells for 10 min with 2 μm compound in the absence and presence of 0.5 μm forskolin. Three compounds, CFTRact-07, CFTRact-10, and CFTRact-16, increased cAMP content alone and potentiated the cAMP elevation elicited by the low concentration of forskolin, giving a cAMP content similar to that found for 20 μm forskolin. The remaining 14 compounds did not increase cellular cAMP when CFTR Cl− current was strongly induced or when given together with 0.5 μmforskolin. All compounds were also tested for phosphatase inhibition. Incubation of cell homogenates with the phosphorylated peptide for 30 min released 347 ± 19 pmol of phosphate/μg of protein. None of the compounds (tested at 10 μm) significantly inhibited phosphatase activity (not shown). The known phosphatase inhibitors, okadaic acid (50 nm), calyculin A (50 nm), and NaF (50 mm), inhibited phosphate release by 96 ± 2, 95 ± 7, and 83 ± 3%, respectively. Cell toxicity was measured by the rhodamine uptake assay. None of the 17 compounds at 10 μm showed significant toxicity when incubated with cell cultures for 24 h. The fluorescence assay was used to investigate dose response, activation kinetics, and reversibility of CFTR activation. Fig.4 B shows representative dose-response data (I−influx versus concentration) for two of the CFTR activators that required forskolin (CFTRact-09 and CFTRact-11) and two that did not (CFTRact-05 and CFTRact-16). Fig. 4 C,top, shows data for the time course of CFTR activation after the addition of these same compounds. Full activation was found for these and the other strong activators in 2–5 min. Fig. 4 C, bottom, shows data for reversibility of CFTR activation in which compounds were incubated with cells for 5 min, and then the fluorescence assay was performed at different times after multiple cell washes. CFTR activation was reversible with 50% reversal at 3–10 min. Short-circuit current analysis was performed to determine dose-response relationships. Fig. 5 A,top, provides representative original current tracings showing 50% maximal activation of short-circuit current by CFTRact-11 and CFTRact-16 at ∼200 nm. Fig. 5 A, bottom left, summarizes dose-response data for these and two additional compounds. Half-maximal short-circuit for most of the 17 compounds was under 1 μm. CFTRact-11 and CFTRact-16 were also tested in human bronchial cells as a native nontransfected cell model. As shown in Fig. 5 A, bottom right, for CFTRact-11, short-circuit current was near maximal at submicromolar concentrations after amiloride inhibition of the ENaC Na+ channel. Similar results were found for CFTRact-16. The activators of wild-type CFTR were screened for their ability to activate two CF-causing CFTR mutants: G551D, which is transported to the plasma membrane but is not active after cAMP elevation, and ΔPhe508, which is retained at the endoplasmic reticulum and has impaired function even after transport to the cell surface (by low temperature incubation or chemical chaperones). Fig. 5 B,top, shows representative fluorescence assays of I− influx in FRT cells coexpressing G551D-CFTR and YFP-H148Q. Measurements were performed using 20 μmforskolin, which itself does not activate G551D-CFTR, and 50 μm of each test compound. Of the 57 activators of wild-type CFTR identified in the fluorescence assay, only three compounds activated G551D-CFTR; the most potent compound (structure in Fig. 5 B, middle) was not one of the strongest activators of wild-type CFTR. The other G551D-CFTR activators (N-[6-methyl-2-(4-methylphenyl)-2H-benzotriazol-5-yl]-4-nitrobenzamide and α-methyl-4-oxo-5-(phenylmethylene)-2-thioxo-3-thiazolidineacetic acid) were also not strong activators of wild-type CFTR. The potencies of these compounds for activation of G551D-CFTR were relatively poor. The fluorescence assay was also performed on FRT cells co-expressing ΔPhe508-CFTR and YFP-H148Q. When cells were grown at 37 °C (ΔPhe508-CFTR retained at the endoplasmic reticulum), none of the 17 activators of wild-type CFTR (in the presence of 100 μm 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP) induced significant I− influx (representative data shown in Fig.6 A, top). However, after cell growth at 27 °C for 2 days to facilitate ΔPhe508-CFTR transport to the plasma membrane, seven of the activators of wild-type CFTR increased I− influx, with CFTRact-09 shown as one example (Fig. 6 A,bottom). Fig. 6 B shows short circuit current experiments in ΔPhe508-CFTR expressing FRT cells. After incubating the cells for 48 h at 27 °C, the isoflavone genistein (in the presence of 20 μm forskolin) induced a small Cl− current at 5 μm and a stronger current at 50 μm (Fig. 6 B, bottom left), in agreement with previous findings for ΔPhe508-CFTR (2Hwang T.-C. Sheppard D.N. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 448-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Little current was in cells grown at 37 °C (Fig. 6 B, top left). The compounds CFTRact-07, CFTRact-09, CFTRact-11, and CFTRact-12 produced strong ΔPhe508-CFTR Cl− currents with apparent Kd less than 1 μm (Fig. 6 B, middle andright). The purpose of this study was to identify and characterize new classes of CFTR activators. We screened collections of diverse, drug-like small molecules that are readily amenable to combinatorial synthesis. Initial screening was performed with individual compounds at 10 μm together with a low concentration of forskolin. The initial screen was designed to broadly identify cAMP-dependent and independent activators of CFTR Cl− conductance that had at least modest cell permeability. The cell lines and screening procedures reported previously (13Galietta L.J.V. Springsteel M.F. Eda M. Niedzinski E.J., By, K. Haddadin M.J. Kurth M.J. Nantz M.H. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19723-19728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) were adapted and optimized for automated high-throughput screening to assay >5000 individual compounds per day. In addition, a ΔPhe508-CFTR expressing FRT epithelial cell line was generated that showed low temperature correction of ΔPhe508-CFTR misprocessing. The logistics of compound handling, cell culture, automated screening, and data analysis/data base development for this study presented a considerable challenge. As described, the screening was successful in >90% of 96-well plates as judged by Cl− transport measurements in positive (apigenin dose response) and negative (no added activator) control wells. The selection of compounds for secondary analysis was based on the magnitude of CFTR activation determined in the primary compound screen. We chose to carry out secondary analysis of 57 compounds that gave greater activation at 10 μm than the reference compound apigenin. After confirming results of the fluorescence assay in CFTR-expressing cells and showing no effects on CFTR-null cells, all compounds were screened for stimulation of CFTR Cl−transport by short-circuit current analysis. Seventeen of the compounds gave strong Cl− currents at 1–2 μmconcentration and were selected for further analysis. The remaining compounds were substantially less potent and in some cases appeared to be false positives of the fluorescence screening assay. All activators showed low cellular toxicity in the rhodamine uptake cell culture assay. Forskolin-dependence and dose-response measurements indicated that a subset of the strongest CFTR activators required low concentrations of forskolin to activate CFTR. As mentioned above, the primary modes of acute CFTR activation include increased CFTR phosphorylation by cAMP elevation or phosphatase inhibition and direct interaction with CFTR, as has been shown for genistein and some xanthines (2Hwang T.-C. Sheppard D.N. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 448-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Three of the strong CFTR activators produced marked elevation of cell cAMP content, particularly in combination with a low concentration of forskolin. This synergy suggests CFTR activation by phosphodiesterase inhibition. The remaining compounds did not increase cellular cAMP under conditions giving strong CFTR Cl− currents, nor did any of the compounds inhibit cell phosphatase activity, suggesting CFTR activation by a direct interaction mechanism. Single-channel electrophysiology is needed to prove a direct interaction mechanism. The core structures of the activators shown in Fig. 3 B(except for the xanthine CFTRact-01) are unrelated to those of known CFTR activators, which act by altering cellular cAMP concentration or phosphatase activity, or activators that are thought to interact directly with CFTR. Of the 17 strongest activators of CFTR Cl− conductance, several structurally similar compounds were identified that contain triazine/diazine and thiazolidine-like heterocycles. In addition, many of the other compounds judged by the fluorescence assay to be strong CFTR activators were analogs of some of the 17 compounds. The putative CFTR-interacting activators may be useful to deduce consensus structure(s) for CFTR activation by computational methods and to facilitate CFTR crystallization for structure determination. The compounds that strongly activated wild-type CFTR were screened for their efficacy in activating G551D-CFTR and ΔPhe508-CFTR, two mutant CFTRs that cause human CF. Of the 57 strong activators of wild-type CFTR, only three compounds activated G551D-CFTR significantly, indicating that CFTR activation is mutation-specific. Unfortunately, the compounds that activated G551D-CFTR did so weakly (Kd 10 μm or higher), no better than existing flavones. However, several of the compounds were effective in activating ΔPhe508-CFTR. When ΔPhe508-CFTR-expressing cells were grown at 37 °C, where ΔPhe508-CFTR is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, none of the compounds activated Cl− currents when added a few minutes before assay. However several compounds induced strong Cl− currents with Kd<1 μm after low temperature correction, which allowed ΔPhe508-CFTR trafficking to the cell plasma membrane. These acutely acting ΔPhe508-CFTR activators may be useful to maximize ΔPhe508-CFTR Cl−transport in combination with compounds that correct ΔPhe508-CFTR misprocessing, for example in improving the sensitivity of a screen to identify compounds that correct ΔPhe508-CFTR misprocessing. In summary, the screening of a collection of 60,000 diverse drug-like compounds revealed new chemical classes of CFTR activators with activation potencies down to 200 nm. The activators were CFTR-specific, rapid, reversible, and nontoxic. Most of the compounds activated CFTR Cl− currents without increasing cellular cAMP content or inhibiting cellular phosphatase activity, suggesting direct CFTR interaction. Some of the compounds activated CFTR only in the presence of mild cAMP activation. Also, several of the compounds strongly activated the CF-causing CFTR mutant ΔPhe508 at submicromolar concentrations after correction of mistrafficking by growth at low temperature. The compounds identified here may be useful in elucidating CFTR activating mechanisms and as leads in CF drug development. We thank Catherine Chen for cell culture, Drs.

We previously localized transcriptional activation and inhibitory regions in one family member, C/EBPε. Here we describe the further characterization of a C/EBPε inhibitory domain termed regulatory domain I. We show that functionally related domains are present in C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ. These domains contain an evolutionarily conserved five-amino acid motif (the regulatory domain motif (RDM)) that conforms to the consensus sequence (I/V/L)KXEP. Mutagenesis studies revealed that the residues at positions 1, 2, and 4 of the RDM are critical for inhibitory domain function. Data base searches identified RDM-like sequences in a number of nuclear proteins. We found that small regions from c-Jun, JunB, and JunD containing this sequence also function as transcriptional inhibitory domains. Importantly, the RDM is similar to the recognition sequence for attachment of the ubiquitin-like protein, small ubiquitin-like modifier-1 (SUMO-1), and the conserved lysine residue of each C/EBP RDM served as an attachment site for SUMO-1. SUMO-1 attachment decreased the inhibitory effect of the C/EBPε regulatory domain, suggesting that sumoylation may play an important role in modulating C/EBPε activity as well as that of the other C/EBP family members.

G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 231-258Google Scholar). Six members of this family have been identified in mammalian cells, and four of these (C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, and C/EBPε) possess similar arrangements of functional domains (3Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Each protein possesses a bipartite carboxyl-terminal DNA binding domain that mediates homo- and heterodimerization and sequence-specific binding to a common DNA recognition motif (4Johnson P.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6919-6930Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 5Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The C/EBP family members have been implicated in the regulation of numerous cell processes, including differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. For example, mice bearing a targeted mutation in the C/EBPε gene exhibit immune defects that result from defective neutrophil function (6Yamanaka R. Barlow C. Lekstrom-Hines J. Castilla L.H. Liu P.P. Eckhaus M. Decker T. Wynshaw-Boris A. Xanthopoulos K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13187-13192Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The phenotype of C/EBPε-deficient mice resembles that seen in humans with neutrophil-specific granule deficiency, and mutations in the C/EBPε gene have been detected in patients with neutrophil-specific granule deficiency (7Lekstrom-Himes J.A. Dorman S.E. Kopar P. Holland S.M. Gallin J.I. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1847-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Likewise, studies of mice carrying mutations in other C/EBP genes have shown that members of this family are critical for the development or function of numerous cell types, including hepatocytes, adipocytes, and macrophages (1Lekstrom-Himes J. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28545-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 2Johnson P.F. Williams S.C. Tronche F. Yaniv M. Liver gene expression. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 231-258Google Scholar). Although the C/EBPs possess similar DNA binding specificities and dimerization properties, each protein exhibits unique functional properties in vivo. The appearance of specific phenotypes in each C/EBP-deficient mouse supports the contention that these proteins do not have fully redundant functions. Although this observation could be partially explained by nonoverlapping expression patterns of the different proteins, direct evidence for specific functions has come from experiments where the coding sequence for one C/EBP has been replaced with that encoding a different family member. For example, the insertion of the C/EBPβ coding sequence into the C/EBPα locus rescued hepatic-specific defects in mice but could not rescue defects in adipose tissue (8Chen S.S. Chen J.F. Johnson P.F. Muppala V. Lee Y.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7292-7299Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Several studies have focused on the identification of functional domains within each C/EBP protein. As mentioned above, four family members (C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, and C/EBPε) possess very similar structures. A potent multimodule transcriptional activation domain (AD) is located at the amino terminus of each protein (3Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 9Nerlov C. Ziff E.B. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 350-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 10Friedman A.D. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1416-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and domains that negatively modulate transcriptional activity have been identified in C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPε (3Williams S.C.

In C/EBPε, we defined two inhibitory domains (RDI and RDII) and identified a short amino acid motif that was critical for RDI function (14Angerer N.D., Du, Y. Nalbant D. Williams S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4147-4154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Interestingly, negative regulatory domains have been identified in a number of other nuclear transcription factors, including c-Fos (15Brown H.J. Sutherland J.A. Cook A. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T.

The inhibitory functions of these various domains within their cognate proteins have been variously attributed to inhibition of DNA binding, transcriptional activation, or synergy with factors bound to adjacent promoter elements (3Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 19Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Pearce D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6040-6050Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, the relationship between these domains is currently unknown. A common feature of these domains is that many have been suggested to be binding sites for currently uncharacterized regulatory proteins (14Angerer N.D., Du, Y. Nalbant D. Williams S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4147-4154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 19Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Pearce D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6040-6050Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Here, we have extended our previous studies on the RDI inhibitory domain of C/EBPε (14Angerer N.D., Du, Y. Nalbant D. Williams S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4147-4154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We show that a conserved five-amino acid motif within the inhibitory domains of C/EBPε, C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ is critical for regulatory domain function. Further, we demonstrate that a lysine residue within this motif is a site for covalent attachment of the small ubiquitin-like modifier-1 (SUMO-1) protein (21Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) and that attachment of SUMO-1 to this residue decreases the transcriptional inhibitory function of the regulatory domain. We propose that sumoylation of C/EBP proteins is a conserved modification that modulates the activity of each family member. Expression plasmids for each full-length C/EBP were constructed using the pMEX expression vector (5Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The coding sequence for the FLAG epitope tag (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys) was inserted immediately following the translation initiation codon, and the coding sequence of each C/EBP was inserted as NcoI/HindIII fragments. In these and all subsequent plasmids, mutations were introduced using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using conditions recommended by the manufacturer. A restriction enzyme recognition sequence was introduced where possible to aid in the detection of plasmids carrying the desired mutation. All constructs were sequenced at the Texas Tech University Biotechnology Core Laboratory to ensure that unintended changes were not introduced during the mutagenesis procedure. Gal4 fusion genes were constructed in the Gal0 plasmid (14Angerer N.D., Du, Y. Nalbant D. Williams S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4147-4154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The generation of each of the wild-type Gal4 fusion plasmids bearing N-terminal regions of C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPε has been described previously (3Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 14Angerer N.D., Du, Y. Nalbant D. Williams S.C. J. Biol.

Gal4 fusions bearing amino acids 1–92 and 1–142 of C/EBPδ were generated using EagI andBssHII restriction enzyme sites present in the mouse cDNA sequence. The coding regions for individual domains were generated as BamHI/BglII fragments and assembled into Gal4 fusion constructs by standard subcloning procedures. The VP16 AD segment inserted into Gal4 fusions consisted of amino acids 429–456 (14Angerer N.D., Du, Y. Nalbant D. Williams S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4147-4154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The FLAG-SUMO-1 expression vector (22Chakrabarti S.R. Sood R. Nandi S. Nucifora G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13281-13285Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) was a kind gift of Dr. Giuseppina Nucifora (University of Illinois at Chicago). A vector expressing a nonprocessable version of SUMO-1 was generated by site-directed mutagenesis, changing glycine 97 to alanine. The Tet-VP16 and TRE-UAS-TATA plasmids (23Garriga-Canut M. Roopra A. Buckley N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14821-14828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) were obtained from Dr. Noel Buckley (University of Leeds). The Gal4-responsive reporter plasmid (G5E1bLuc), which consists of five copies of the Gal4 binding site upstream of the adenovirus E1b minimal promoter, was described previously (3Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The monkey kidney COS-1 cell line was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). All luciferase-based transfections were performed in 3.5-cm dishes using 2 × 105 cells/well, and transfections for preparing extracts for Western blotting were performed in 10-cm dishes using 1.5 × 106 cells/dish. Transfections were performed with the Effectene transfection reagent using conditions recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The optimal concentration of each plasmid was determined empirically for each type of transfection experiment. Transfections that examined the activity of Gal4 fusion proteins contained 150 ng of the Gal4 expression plasmid and 150 ng of the G5E1bLUC reporter. Transfections that examined the ability of the C/EBPε RD to inhibit the activity of the Tet-VP16 activator in trans contained 250 ng of the TRE-UAS-TATA luciferase reporter, 200 ng of the Tet-VP16 expression plasmid, and 250 ng of the Gal4-C/EBPε expression plasmid. Transfections that tested the effect of co-expression of wild type or mutant SUMO-1 on RD function contained 150 ng of G5E1bLUC, 250 ng of the Gal4-C/EBPε expression plasmid, and 20 or 40 ng of the SUMO-1 expression plasmid. The total DNA concentration was normalized in this last experiment using empty pCMV expression plasmid. Transfections for Western extract preparation contained 3 μg of the appropriate expression plasmid. A control plasmid containing the Renillaluciferase gene under the control of the thymidine kinase promoter was included in all experiments for normalization of transfection efficiencies. All transfections were performed in triplicate at least three times and in some cases up to seven times. Statistical analyses were carried out using a two-tailed Student's t test. Luciferase assays were performed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Nuclear extracts were prepared from transfected COS-1 cells as described previously (24Bretz J.D. Williams S.C. Baer M. Johnson P.F. Schwartz R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7306-7310Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) except when isopeptidase inhibitors were used. In these samples, the cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 μg/ml E-64 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and lysed in Dignam Buffer A (25Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Darnell R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar) supplemented with 10 μg/ml E-64. Samples were separated on 12 or 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immune detection was performed using the Supersignal chemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce) as described previously (26Nalbant D. Williams S.C. Stocco D.M. Khan S.A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The anti-Gal4 DNA binding domain (DBD) monoclonal antiserum (RK5C1) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and the anti-FLAG polyclonal antiserum was obtained from Sigma. The C/EBPε-specific rabbit polyclonal antiserum was raised against a specific epitope in the C-terminal portion of rat C/EBPε. In a previous study, we performed a structure/function analysis of the C/EBPε polypeptide and identified several autonomous domains, including two activation and two inhibitory domains (14Angerer N.D., Du, Y. Nalbant D. Williams S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4147-4154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). One inhibitory domain, termed RDII, contained several potential sites for phosphorylation by members of the MAP kinase superfamily; thus, RDII activity is probably dependent on phosphorylation of C/EBPε in response to upstream signaling pathways. However, a second inhibitory domain, termed RDI, did not contain obvious signatures for post-translational modifications, and thus the mechanism of action of this domain remained unclear. Initial comparisons of the sequence of RDI with inhibitory domains from other transcription factors revealed weak sequence similarities, suggesting the existence of conserved inhibitory domains within multiple transcriptional regulatory proteins (14Angerer N.D., Du, Y. Nalbant D. Williams S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4147-4154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We therefore performed extensive sequence comparisons of the RDI sequence with protein sequences in public databases. These searches revealed the existence of a five-amino acid motif that is conserved in three other members of the C/EBP family, C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ (see TableI), which represents the only conserved sequence within the experimentally defined minimal RDI domain (see sequence comparison in Ref. 2Johnson P.F. Williams S.C. Tronche F. Yaniv M. Liver gene expression. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 231-258Google Scholar). This motif is defined by the consensus sequence (I/V/L)KXEP and will be referred to hereafter as the regulatory domain motif (RDM). The availability of peptide sequences for each C/EBP protein from multiple species permitted exploration of the evolutionary conservation of this sequence. In all vertebrate species in which orthologous relationships to the mammalian C/EBP proteins could be established, the RDM sequence was conserved, in some cases exactly (Table I). For example, in C/EBPα, the RDM sequence IKQEP was perfectly conserved from humans to fish. Significantly, C/EBP proteins from nonvertebrates (twoDrosophila species (27Rorth P. Montell D.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2299-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and two Aplysia species (28Alberini C.M. Ghirardi M. Metz R. Kandel E.R.

These comparisons suggest that the RDM might be an important component of an evolutionarily conserved transcriptional inhibitory domain in C/EBP proteins.Table IEvolutionary conservation of regulatory domain motifs in C/EBPsSpeciesSequenceAccession no.SpeciesSequenceAccession no.C/EBPαC/EBPβHsLRPLV IKQEPREEDEP49715HsPPPAE LKAEPGFEPANP 005185BtLRPLV IKQEPREEDEO02754BtPPPAE LKAEPGFEPAO02755MmLRPLV IKQEPREEDEAAH28890MmPPPAA LKAEPGFEPANP 034013RnLRPLV IKQEPREEDENP 036656RnPPPAA LKAEPGFEPANP 077039GgLRPLV IKQEPREEEES26295GgPQIVE TKVEPVFETLQ05826X1LRPLA IKQEPREEEAA56554X1PQLGE TKVEPVFESLCAA76309RcLRHLV IKQEPRGEEEAAA52223DrMRPVA IKQEPREEDENP 571960C/EBPδC/EBPɛHsAAPRL LKREPDWGDGNP005186HsPRAVA VKEEPRGPEGNP 001796BtPAPRP LKREPDWGDGBAA20097OaPAPRP LKREPDWGDGCAB92973OaPRAVA VKEEPRGPEGCAA10944MmVARGP LKREPDWGDGNP031705MmPRAVA VKEEPRGPEGRnIARGP LKREPDWGDGQ03484RnPRAVA VKEEPRGPEGP56261RcQHYKS LKQEPDWSDSAAA52224Dr1LFNNT VKQEKPDFYMNP571962Dr2SFCAP IKKEADWSDSNP571962Nonvertebrate C/EBPsConsensus RDMDmSDSST IKEEPIDPEYA43481(I/V/L)KXEPDvDSSST IKEEPIDPDYQ02638AcQWPNL VKREDFGVRTA53066AkPNLGQ VKHEDFGVRTAAG61258The peptide sequences of four C/EBP family members (C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, and C/EBPɛ) from a variety of species were compared to identify residues conserved with the region encompassing the minimal negative regulatory domain of C/EBPɛ (amino acids 97–128 of the mouse protein). A five-amino acid motif was identified that was highly conserved in each C/EBP in a variety of vertebrate species and also in nonvertebrate C/EBPs.

Two potential RDMs were identified in zebrafish C/EBPδ. To test the contribution of the RDM to RDI function in C/EBPε, we performed mutagenesis studies using Gal4-C/EBPε fusion proteins that either contained or lacked RDI. Our earlier studies mapped the minimal RDI element to the region between amino acids 97 and 128 of the mouse C/EBPε protein, with the RDM located between amino acids 120 and 124 (14Angerer N.D., Du, Y. Nalbant D. Williams S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4147-4154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed mutagenesis on a Gal4 construct containing amino acids 1–128 of C/EBPε and compared the activity of the wild type and mutant proteins to a fully active Gal4-C/EBPε fusion protein that only contained activation domain sequences located between amino acids 1 and 64 (Fig.1 A). Each construct was co-transfected into COS-1 cells along with a Gal4-responsive luciferase reporter plasmid. In agreement with previous data, the inclusion of sequences encompassing amino acids 65–128 decreased the activity of the fusion protein to less that 10% of Gal4ε-(1–64). Each residue within the RDM was first changed to alanine to test their respective contribution to this inhibitory effect. Changes introduced at positions 1, 2, and 4 essentially abolished the inhibitory function, whereas changes introduced at positions 3 and 5 were silent. Thus, residues that were critical for RD function were those that exhibited the highest degree of sequence conservation within the RDMs of each C/EBP. The identity of the residue at position 3 of the RDM appears not to be fixed, whereas the proline at position 5 may provide important structural information but may not contribute to RDM function per se. We also changed the three central charged amino acids within the C/EBPε RDM to arginine. As before, changes at positions 2 and 4 diminished inhibitory domain function, whereas substitution of arginine for the glutamic acid residue at position 3 had little effect. Importantly, these data indicate that the presence of a lysine residue at position 2 is critical for RDM function. We next extended these studies to include the other mammalian C/EBPs listed in Table I. Previous studies had mapped transcriptional inhibitory domains in C/EBPα and C/EBPβ that overlapped the region encompassing their RDMs (3Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 12Pei D.Q. Shih C.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1480-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13Kowenz-Leutz E. Twamley G. Ansieau S. Leutz A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2781-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar); however, no data were available for C/EBPδ. Therefore, we constructed pairs of Gal4 fusion constructs containing either minimal N-terminal ADs from each protein or extended regions that include the RDM from each protein (Fig.2 A). These constructs were introduced into COS-1 cells, and the relative activities of the expressed proteins were examined as described above. In each case, the inclusion of RDM-containing regions resulted in significant inhibition of AD function (Fig. 2 A) to levels between 0.4 and 3.7% of the uninhibited control protein. Again, mutations were introduced into the RDM sequences of each protein to test whether they contributed to the inhibitory function, although these experiments only focused on the perfectly conserved lysine and glutamic acids residues at positions 2 and 4. In each case, proteins bearing the indicated mutations were significantly more active than the wild type protein, particularly in the case of C/EBPα and C/EBPδ. Although the introduction of mutations into the RDM of C/EBPβ resulted in significant increases in the activity of the resultant proteins, these proteins were still significantly less active than the protein containing the AD alone (Gal4-β-(1–83)). Further analysis of the inhibitory domain of C/EBPβ indicated the existence of additional inhibitory sequences in this protein, 2J. Kim and S. C. Williams, unpublished observations. and further studies are under way to define these sequences. Nevertheless, these studies clearly demonstrated the critical importance of the RDM for inhibitory domain function in each C/EBP. We previously provided evidence that the RDI element of C/EBPε functioned as a site for protein/protein interactions (14Angerer N.D., Du, Y. Nalbant D. Williams S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4147-4154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To further investigate the mechanism of action of this domain, we next tested the ability of this domain to inhibit the action of a heterologous activation domain in both cis andtrans arrangements. Single or multiple copies of the C/EBPε RDI domain (amino acids 65–128) were attached to a fusion protein containing the Gal4 DBD and the VP16 AD, and the activity of the resulting proteins was tested as before (Fig.3 A). A Gal4-VP16 protein carrying a single RDI element possessed less than 10% of the activity of the parental protein, and attachment of additional RDI elements yielded further inhibition that was proportional to the number of RDI elements. We next tested whether the RDI element functioned only when located adjacent to an AD by inserting a mutant form of the RDI element between the VP16AD and one or two copies of the wild type RDI element. Attachment of a mutant RDI element resulted in a modest decrease in the activity of the Gal4-VP16 fusion protein; however, the further attachment of one or two functional RDI elements in this more distal arrangement led to dramatic transcriptional repression (Fig.3 A). To examine RDI function in trans, Gal4 fusion proteins carrying single or triple copies of wild type or mutant RDI elements, without any AD sequences, were generated. These proteins were tested for their ability to inhibit the activity of an activator protein consisting of the DNA binding domain from the Tet repressor fused to the VP16 AD (14Angerer N.D., Du, Y. Nalbant D. Williams S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4147-4154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The effect of each RDI-containing fusion protein was compared with the Gal4 DBD alone on a reporter construct containing seven copies of the Tet response element (TRE) in a distal position and five Gal4 binding sites located in a proximal position (TRE-UAS-TATA; Fig. 3 B). Coexpression of Gal4 fusion proteins containing single or triple RDI elements decreased the measured activity of the Tet-VP16 activator protein to ∼10 and 1% of the control value, respectively. This effect was dependent o"

In contrast to PPARs, unsaturated fatty acids act as antagonist to oxysterol activation of LXRα in HEK293 and hepatoma cell lines (6Ou J., Tu, H. Shan B. Luk A. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Bashmakov Y.

The hierarchy for the fatty acid effect on LXR is 20:4,n6 > 18:2,n6 > 18:1,n9; saturated fatty acids have no effect. The half-maximal effect for 20:4,n6 antagonism of oxysterol binding to the LXR-ligand binding domain is ∼1.5 μm. This level of fatty acid is comparable to the K d for 20-carbon PUFA binding to PPARs (3Xu H.E. Lambert M.H. Montana V.G. Parks D.J. Blanchard S.G. Brown P.J. Sernbach D.D. Lehmann J.M. Wisely G.B.

Based on in vitro binding and cell culture studies both PPARs and LXR have emerged as prospective monitors of intracellular NEFA levels, and in liver these receptors would respond accordingly by altering metabolism to prevent lipid and cholesterol overload. However, there remains little information that documents changes in intracellular NEFA levels in cells or how lipid metabolism might contribute to the regulation of NEFA levels and influence nuclear receptor activity. During the course of our studies, we observed that the fatty acid regulation of PPARα and LXRα in HEK293 cells was strain-dependent. This difference in fatty acid responsiveness provided us with an opportunity to identify prospective metabolic pathways that impact intracellular NEFA levels and affect nuclear receptor activity. Our studies show that while both cell types share the same metabolic pathways for 20:4,n6 assimilation onto complex lipids, there are clear quantitative differences. These differences contribute to the level of non-esterified PUFA in cells that, in turn, affects LXR and PPAR activity. Using the HEK293 cell model has provided support for the notion that both LXRα and PPARα are indeed sensors of intracellular NEFA. Two strains of HEK293 identified as HEK293-E (early passage) and HEK293-L (late passage) were obtained from K. Olson and K. Gallo at the Department of Physiology at Michigan State University. Cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen) with 7.5% fetal calf serum (Intergen, Purchase, NY) in plastic tissue culture vessels (Falcon; 80- or 50-mm culture dishes or 6-well plates). Cells were grown to confluence and then incubated overnight in serum-free media before fatty acid treatment. CMX-hLXRα, CMX-hLXRβ, CMX-Gal4-hLXRα, CMX-Gal4-hLXRβ, TK-LXREx3-Luc, TK-MH100X4-Luc, and SG5-rPPARα were previously described (8Pan D.A. Mater M.K. Thelen A.P. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Jump D.B. J.

The primers used for this construction are: sense, 873GGG ATG TCA CAC AAT GCA ATC CGT and antisense,1761TCA GTA CAT GTC TCT GTA GAT CTC. phRG-Luc was obtained from Promega and serves as an internal control for transfection efficiency. All plasmids were cesium-purified before transfection. Cells were grown to confluence in 6-well culture plates. Cells in each well receive 1 μg of reporter plasmid and 1 μg of receptor expression plasmid. Cells were transfected using Lipofectin (6.6 μl/μg DNA) in serum-free media. After an overnight transfection period, cells were treated with fatty acids or drugs for 24 h in serum-free media containing bovine serum albumin (BSA). The BSA was adjusted to maintain a 5:1 molar ratio of fatty acid to BSA. LXRs were activated with 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (Research Plus, Inc.), Manasquan, at 20 μm. The vehicle for 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol is ethanol. After treatment, cells were lysed and assayed for firefly and Renilla luciferase activity using the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega) with a dual channel Turner Luminometer. Protein was measured using the Bio-Rad Protein reagent with BSA as standard. All experiments were run in triplicate and repeated at least one time. Cells were grown to confluence in 50-mm plastic dishes in DMEM/F12 plus 7.5% fetal calf serum. Prior to fatty acid treatment cells were incubated overnight in serum-free media. Cells were treated with [14C]20:4,n6 (3 ml of DMEM/F12 containing 100 μm 20:4,n6, 0.5 μCi, (1.7 Ci/mol)). 14C-labeled fatty acids were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and non-radioactive fatty acids were purchased from Nu-Chek Prep (Elysian, MN). Fatty acid-free BSA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) is added to 20 μm. Cells were treated with fatty acids for 1.5, 6, and 24 h. At harvest, media was collected, cells were washed one time with phosphate-buffered saline + 20 μm BSA, then washed one time with PBS, and resuspended in 500 μl of 40% methanol. The methanol extract was acidified with HCl to 0.75 n, and lipids were extracted with chloroform:methanol (2:1) containing 1 mm butylated hydroxytoluene (10Karara A. Dishman E. Blair I. Falck J.R. Capdevila J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19822-19827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein and aqueous phases were re-extracted with chloroform + 1 mm BHT. The organic phases were pooled, dried under nitrogen, resuspended in chloroform + 1 mm BHT, and stored at –80 °C. Lipids are separated by thin layer chromatography (LK6D Silica G 60A, Whatman) in hexane:diethyl ether:acetic acid (90:30:1). Distribution and quantifying14C used a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager 820. Location of lipids was compared with authentic standards for triacylglycerol (TAG), diacylglycerol (DAG), cholesterol esters (CE), fatty acids, fatty acid (wax) esters (Sigma), and glycerol- and sphingo-phospholipids (Avanti Polar Lipids). Uptake of 14C into the organic fraction was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Depletion of 14C-labeled fatty acids from media was quantified by scintillation counting and thin layer chromatography followed by PhosphorImager analysis as described above. Confluent HEK293 cells in 80-mm plastic dishes were treated with 100 μm fatty acid (non-radioactive) as described above. Afterward, cells were recovered in 40% methanol and [14C]16:0 was added (0.2 μCi/plate) as a recovery standard. Total lipid was extracted as described above. Total lipids were saponified (0.5 n KOH in 80% methanol, 1 h at 50 °C.), neutralized, extracted in diethyl ether, dried, and resuspended in methanol + 0.1 mm BHT for RP-HPLC analysis (reverse phase C18 column, Symmetry Shield, 2487 UV detector set to 192 nm with a 600 Controller; Waters Corp.). A linear gradient of 10% acetonitrile + 0.1% acetic acid to 100% acetonitrile + 0.1% acetic acid over 40 min was used to fractionate unsaturated fatty acids. Verification and quantification of unsaturated fatty acids by RP-HPLC used authentic fatty acid standards (Nu-Chek Prep) and Win-flow Radio HPLC software for windows from IN/US Systems, Inc., Tampa, FL. The identity of specific fatty acids was verified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry at the mass spectroscopy facility at Michigan State University. The NEFA fraction in total cellular lipids was fractionated on amino-propyl columns [Alltech, Inc] (11Kim H-H Salem Jr., N. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 2285-2289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid extracts in chloroform + 1 mm BHT were applied to a 0.1-ml amino-propyl column and washed extensively with chloroform:isopropanol (2:1) to remove neutral lipids. NEFA were eluted with diethyl ether + 2% acetic acid. Phospholipids were retained on the column. The diethyl ether-2% acetic acid fraction was dried under nitrogen, resuspended in methanol + 0.1 mm BHT, and used directly for RP-HPLC fractionation and quantification of unsaturated fatty acids. The fractional recovery of NEFA from whole cells extracts was >95%. PPARα is a well established target for fatty acid regulation (1Jump D.B. J. Biol.

However, LXRα has only recently been identified as a target for fatty acid regulation (6Ou J., Tu, H. Shan B. Luk A. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Bashmakov Y. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6027-6032Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). In Figs.Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, we characterized the fatty acid regulation of oxysterol activation of LXRα and LXRβ and fatty acid regulation of PPARα in two strains of HEK293 cells. These studies will show that these two strains of HEK293 cells give very different results for fatty acid effects on LXR and PPAR activity. The two strains of HEK293 cells differ in passage number; HEK293-E are early passage cells and HEK293-L are late passage cells. HEK293-L cells grow faster than HEK293-E with a doubling time of ∼1 day versus2 days, respectively. Moreover, HEK293-L cells grow to a higher density (3.8 × 106 cells/well) than HEK293-E (2.8 × 106 cells/well). However, all transfections and fatty acid metabolism studies described below were carried out at full confluence in serum-free media when cell growth was minimized.Figure 3Effect of 20:4,n6 and WY14,643 on PPAR α-regulated gene expression in HEK293-E and HEK293-L. Cells are transfected with SG5-PPARα and the AOX-PPRE-TK-CAT reporter. Cells are treated with 20:4,n6 or WY14,643 at 100 μm overnight. CAT activity and protein was measured (8Pan D.A. Mater M.K.

B, confluent HEK293-E cells were transfected with expression vectors containing LXR-LBD fused to the Gal4 DBD: CMX-Gal4-hLXRα, CMX-Gal4-hLXRβ. The reporter plasmid was TK-MH100X4-Luc, which contains four copies of the Gal4 binding motif. After an overnight transfection, cells were treated without or with 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and without and with fatty acids (16:0, 18:1,n9, 20:4,n6) at 100 μm for 24 h. Cells were lysed and assayed for firefly and Renilla luciferase activity and protein. Mean ± S.D.; n = 3.C, cells were transfected as in B, and after an overnight transfection, cells were treated without or with 20 μm 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and without and with fatty acids (20:4,n6, 18:3,n3, 20:5,n3, and 22:6,n3) at 100 μmfor 24 h. Mean ± S.D.; n > 6. These results are representative of at least two separate studies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fatty acid regulation of nuclear receptors was evaluated by transfection analysis using either full-length receptors or Gal4-LBD chimeric receptors. Accordingly, cells were transfected with the LXRE-TK-Luc reporter plasmid and expression vectors containing full-length LXRα or LXRβ (Fig. 1 A). The LXR ligand, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol induced a 6- and 2-fold increase in LUC activity in HEK293-E cells transfected with full-length LXRα and LXRβ, respectively. 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol had no effect on LUC activity when LXR expression vectors were omitted from the transfection mixture. Treatment of cells with 100 μm 16:0 had no effect on either basal or oxysterol-induction of LUC activity. Treatment of cells with 18:1,n9 or 20:4,n6 reduced the inductive effect of 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol on LUC by 50 and 75%, respectively. LXRβ was induced 2-fold by 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol induction (∼2-fold). The oxysterol induction of LXRβ was not affected by fatty acid treatment. Thus, the effect of fatty acids on LXRs is specific for LXRα. Further characterization of the fatty acid effects on LXR used Gal4-chimeric receptors containing the LXR LBD fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain (Fig. 1 B). Transfection of HEK293-E cells with Gal4-LXRα-LBD led to a comparable level of induction of LUC activity (∼4-fold) following 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol treatment as seen with the full-length receptor. Moreover, the effect of fatty acids on the oxysterol regulation of LXR-LBD was essentially the same as that seen with the full-length receptor. Again, LXRα, but not LXRβ, was responsive to unsaturated fatty acid regulation. Substituting TO-091317 (at 1 μm), a potent LXR agonist (9Janowski B.A. Grogan M.J. Jones S.A. Wisely G.B. Kliewer S.A. Corey E.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 266-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar), for 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol yielded essentially the same results for both the LXRα and LXRβ (not shown) as seen in Fig. 1,A and B. Finally, n3-PUFA were tested for their effects on Gal4-LXRα-LBD activation (Fig. 1 C). 22:6,n3 was as effective as 20:4,n6 at suppressing oxysterol-activated LXRα, while 18:3,n3 was the least effective at antagonizing oxysterol-regulation of LXRα. These results confirm previous reports on the antagonistic effect of unsaturated fatty acids on the oxysterol regulation of LXRα (6Ou J., Tu, H. Shan B. Luk A. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Bashmakov Y. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6027-6032Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). We have extended these observations to include 20- and 22-carbon n3 PUFAs as effective inhibitors of oxysterol activation of LXRα. However, neither n3 nor n6 PUFA affected oxysterol activation of LXRβ. A similar analysis in the HEK293-L cells (Fig. 2) displayed a very different response pattern to fatty acids. Oxysterol 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol induced LUC activity by 8- and 2-fold in cells transfected with the LXRα and LXRβ expression vectors. This response is comparable to that seen in the HEK293-E cells (Fig. 1 A). In contrast to the HEK293-E cells, oxysterol activation of LXRα and LXRβ in HEK293-L cells was insensitive to fatty acid regulation. In addition, both the LXRα and β chimeric Gal4-LBD receptors were insensitive to fatty acid regulation in HEK293-L cells. Even higher levels of fatty acids (300 μm) had no effect on LUC activity (Fig.8). Because fatty acid regulation of LXRα was cell-dependent, we examined the fatty acid regulation of a second fatty acid-regulated nuclear receptor, i.e. PPARα, in the two HEK293 strains. As noted above, the fatty acid regulation of PPARα is well established (2Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar, 3Xu H.E. Lambert M.H. Montana V.G. Parks D.J. Blanchard S.G. Brown P.J. Sernbach D.D. Lehmann J.M. Wisely G.B. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Milburn M.V. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). The two HEK293 cell strains were transfected with a reporter vector containing the acyl CoA oxidase PPRE fused upstream from the TK promoter and the CAT reporter gene (AOX-PPRE-TK-CAT). Cells were co-transfected with the SG5-PPARα expression vector. Cells were treated with 100 μm 20:4,n6 or WY14,643 (a strong PPARα agonist) for 24 h. In HEK293-E transfected with SG5-PPARα, CAT activity was induced ∼2.2-fold by 20:4,n6 or WY14,643 (Fig. 3). While WY14,643 induced CAT activity 2.7-fold in HEK293-L cells, 20:4,n6 had no effect on CAT activity. In the absence of SG5-PPARα transfection, CAT activity was not affected by either 20:4,n6 or WY14,643. Thus, like LXRα, PPARα is not sensitive to fatty acid regulation in HEK293-L cells. We evaluated the fatty acid sensitivity of LXRα and PPARα in HEK293-E cells by carrying out a dose-response analysis (Fig. 4, A andB). In this study, the chimeric receptor Gal4-LXRα-LBD was used to assess the sensitivity of LXRα to fatty acid regulation. The maximum effect of 20:4,n6 on 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol-induced LUC activity was an 80% inhibition at 200 μm 20:4,n6. Fifty percent inhibition (IC50) of oxysterol-mediated induction of LXRα by 20:4,n6 was at ∼60 μm. Assessment of fatty acid activation of PPARα used both the full-length SG5-PPARα expression vector and the Gal4-PPARα-LBD to activate the CAT or LUC reporter genes, respectively. At 200 μm, 20:4,n6 induced reporter gene activity 2.2-fold. This level was comparable to the effect of WY14,643 (100 μm) on PPARα-regulated reporter gene activity. The ED50 for the inductive effect of 20:4,n6 was ∼50 μm. These results indicate that in HEK293-E cells, both LXRα and PPARα display a similar sensitivity to exogenously added 20:4,n6. The fatty acid regulation of LXRα and PPARα is clearly different in the two HEK293 strains. As noted above, there are several factors that can account for this difference such as cell growth and density. However, the use of cells at confluence and fatty acid treatments in serum-free media minimized these differences. An alternative explanation focuses on metabolic differences in the cell and relates to how these two cell types metabolize exogenous fatty acids. Because both receptors bind NEFA (3Xu H.E. Lambert M.H. Montana V.G. Parks D.J. Blanchard S.G. Brown P.J. Sernbach D.D. Lehmann J.M. Wisely G.B. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Milburn M.V. Mol.

To test this hypothesis, two approaches were used to examine 20:4,n6 metabolism in these cells. The first approach used a kinetic analysis of [14C]20:4,n6 uptake and metabolism. The second approach quantified mass changes of specific fatty acids in cells following treatment with fatty acids. HEK293 cells were treated with [14C]20:4,n6 at 100 μm under the same conditions as used for the transfection studies. Fig. 5 A illustrates the assimilation of [14C]20:4,n6 into the chloroform/methanol-soluble fraction of cells and the fractional distribution of [14C]20:6,n6 into various lipid fractions. No significant difference in fatty acid uptake or its assimilation into the chloroform-methanol-soluble fraction was observed. Thin-layer chromatographic separation of lipids allowed for the analysis of the fractional distribution of [14C]20:4,n6 into TAG, DAG, and polar lipids (lysophosphatidic acid, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidyl choline, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, phosphatidyl inositol, phosphatidyl serine, sphingomyelin) (Fig. 5 B). At all time points examined, there was no significant differences in the fractional distribution of [14C]20:4,n6 between TAG, DAG, or polar lipids between the two cells. However the fraction labeled “Other” is clearly different between the two cell types at all time points examined. This fraction is composed of cholesterol esters, neutral plasmalogens and NEFA (Fig. 5 C). There are clear differences in the proportional distribution of 14C-labeled fatty acids in these three components. First, the non-esterified14C-labeled fatty acid represents ≤3% of the total14C-labeled fatty acid incorporated into the chloroform/methanol extract of these cells. HEK293-E cells assimilate a greater fraction of the 14C-labeled fatty acid into cholesterol ester, while HEK293-L have a greater proportion of exogenous fatty acid assimilated into a fraction having chromatographic properties characteristic of neutral plasmalogens. In fact the level of 20:4,n6 assimilation into neutral plasmalogens far exceeds the level of fatty acid assimilation into CE. Together, these studies reveal differences in the level of 14C-fatty acid retained in the NEFA pool and its assimilation into two neutral lipid fractions,i.e. cholesterol ester and neutral plasmalogen. The use of 14C-labeled fatty acids provides important clues as to how exogenous fatty acids are distributed to various lipid fractions. However, to determine how addition of exogenous fatty acids affect levels of endogenous fatty acids as well as the generation of fatty acid metabolites, we examine the fatty acid composition in the total chloroform/methanol extract as well as the fractionated NEFA pool. Accordingly, cells were treated with non-radioactive 20:4,n6 at 100 μm (as described above) and total lipid was extracted from cells at 0, 1.5, 6, and 24 h after initiating treatment. Total lipids in the chloroform-methanol extract were saponified and fractionated by RP-HPLC. Although this analysis is restricted to unsaturated fatty acids, all fatty acid profiles were confirmed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (see “Methods and Materials”). 18:1,n9 is a major unsaturated fatty acid (∼1200 nmol/mg protein) in both cell types (Fig.6 A). The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis indicated that both 16:0 and 18:0 are prominent lipids in HEK293 cells (not shown). Linoleic (18:2,n6), arachidonic (20:4,n6), and adrenic (22:4,n6) are minor PUFA at < 100 nmol/mg protein. Treatment of cells with 100 μm 20:4,n6 leads to a 6.3, 11.8, and 8.7-fold increase in total 20:4,n6 in HEK293-E cells and a 8.1, 12, and 11.8-fol"

The adenovirus-transforming protein E1A is acetylated by its cellular targets, the co-activators CREB-binding protein, p300, and p300/CREB-binding protein-associated factor in vitro and also in vivo at a single lysine residue (Lys239) within a multifunctional carboxyl-terminal domain necessary for both nuclear localization and interaction with the transcriptional co-repressor carboxyl-terminal binding protein (CtBP). In contrast to a previous report, we demonstrate that acetylation of Lys239 does not disrupt CtBP binding and that 12 S E1A-mediated repression of CREB-binding protein-dependent transcription does not require recruitment of CtBP. Instead we find that the cytoplasmic fraction of E1-transformed 293 cells is enriched for acetylated E1A with relative exclusion from the nuclear compartment. Whereas wild type 12 S E1A binds importin-α3, binding affinity was markedly reduced both by single amino acid substitution mutations and acetylation at Lys239. This is the first demonstration that acetylation may alter nuclear partitioning by direct interference with nuclear import receptor recognition.

The cellular effects of E1A are thought to be mediated primarily by effects on gene transcription, modulating both cellular and viral gene expression through physical associations with cellular transcriptional regulatory proteins (5Flint J. Shenk T. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 177-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The E1A region of adenovirus encodes two major mRNAs (12 and 13 S), generated through alternative splicing of two exons from a single primary transcript. For the C-type adenovirus (serotypes 2 and 5), these mRNAs encode proteins of 243 and 289 amino acids, respectively (Fig. 1 A). Amino acid sequences of E1A isoforms from each of the adenovirus serotypes differ substantially, except within CRs1 that act as interaction motifs for E1A target proteins. Both forms interact with cellular proteins including pRB and the transcriptional co-activators CBP and p300 through CR2, and CR1 and N-terminal regions, respectively. The E1A 13 S form (E1A 289R) differs from the 12 S form (E1A 243R) in the presence of an additional first exon-derived sequence (CR3), which serves as an interaction domain for ATF-2 and TBP/TFIID (5Flint J. Shenk T. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 177-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Whereas both of the two major forms of E1A are necessary for productive infection and viral transformation, the CR3 region is dispensable for immortalization and cellular transformation in conjunction with cellular oncogenes (1Moran E.

The 12 S E1A protein inhibits CBP- and p300-dependent transcription by interacting with and repressing the activities of these co-activators, although the mechanism of repression remains controversial. E1A repression of the co-activator function of CBP depends on a direct physical interaction between the N terminus of E1A and at least one domain of the CBP and p300 co-activators (7Wang H.G. Rikitake Y. Carter M.C. Yaciuk P. Abraham S.E. Zerler B. Moran E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 476-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lundblad J.R. Kwok R.P. Laurance M.E. Harter M.L. Goodman R.H.

This region of CBP/p300 serves as an interaction site for a large number of transcription factors, including c-Fos, E2F, MyoD, and the basal factor TFIIB (10Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar). Models proposed for inhibition of CBP/p300 function have included sequestration of CBP/p300 from active transcription complexes (11Yang X.J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The second exon-encoded functions of E1A are likewise functionally complex. Deletion mutations within the C terminus of E1A relieve negative effects on transformation and correlate in part with a loss of binding of E1A to CtBP, a 48-kDa phosphoprotein (21Boyd J.M. Subramanian T. Schaeper U., La Regina M. Bayley S. Chinnadurai G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 22Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T.

This motif and variant sequences (-PXDLS-) are also found in a number of cellular transcriptional repressor proteins important in cellular proliferation, growth, and differentiation (25Chinnadurai G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 213-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). In some of these CtBP-interacting proteins, mutation of a core -PXDLS- motif both decreases binding of CtBP and correlates with either abolished or reduced repressor activity (24Furusawa T. Moribe H.

Virol. 2001; 75: 7749-7755Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), mutation of this motif has little or no effect on repression. The biochemical consequences of CtBP binding to E1A are less well defined. One model implicates CtBP in repression of CR1-dependent transactivation through E1A (32Sollerbrant K. Chinnadurai G. Svensson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2578-2584Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Alternatively, E1A may act to displace or sequester CtBP from cellular targets that contain the -PXDLS- motif (33Schaeper U. Subramanian T. Lim L. Boyd J.M. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8549-8552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), a model more consistent with proposed mechanisms for E1A regulation of p300/CBP and pRB activities. A recent report suggests that CtBP may directly participate in the activity of E1A and mediate repression of CBP-dependent co-activation by E1A. Zhang et al. (34Zhang Q. Yao H., Vo, N. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14323-14328Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) report that p300- or P/CAF-dependent acetylation of 12 S E1A at Lys239 within the -PLDLSCK 239- motif attenuates E1A repression of CBP activity by impairing the interaction of CtBP with E1A. In this model, recruitment of the CtBP co-repressor complex is essential for the repression of CBP-dependent co-activation by E1A. Whereas several reports have indicated that sequences outside of the -PLDLS- might influence the interaction of CtBP with its targets, in E1A this lysine has been shown to be dispensable in peptide competition studies (35Molloy D.P. Milner A.E. Yakub I.K. Chinnadurai G. Gallimore P.H. Grand R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20867-20876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and examination of -PXDLS- and surrounding sequences of the known probable CtBP cellular targets indicates that this lysine is not invariably conserved (36Turner J. Crossley M. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Furthermore, previous studies demonstrate that a sequence carboxyl-terminal to the -PLDLS- motif, including Lys239, is essential for nuclear partitioning of E1A (37Lyons R.H. Ferguson B.Q. Rosenberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2451-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 38Douglas J.L. Quinlan M.P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 8061-8065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Douglas J.L. Quinlan M.P. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 475-483PubMed Google Scholar, 40Douglas J.L. Quinlan M.P. Virology. 1996; 220: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that like P/CAF and p300, CBP acetylates lysine 239 of 12S E1A in vitro and that a small fraction of E1A is acetylated at this lysine in vivo in E1-transformed HEK293 cells and E1A-transfected cells. In our experiments, single amino acid substitution mutations and bona fide acetylation of full-length E1A at Lys239 do not disrupt binding to CtBPin vitro. Whereas substitution mutations at this position abrogate 12 S E1A repression of phospho-CREB-dependent, CBP-mediated co-activation of transcription due to impaired nuclear localization, mutations within the -PLDLS- motif that completely disrupt CtBP binding have no effect on E1A-mediated repression of CBP function, suggesting that the association of CtBP with E1A is not necessary for repression of CBP activity. Instead, consistent with a previous study (39Douglas J.L. Quinlan M.P. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 475-483PubMed Google Scholar), we find that the lysine at position 239 is invariably essential for the nuclear localization of 12 S E1A, and further that E1A acetylated at this lysine resides predominantly in the cytoplasm of E1A-expressing cells. 12 S E1A binds strongly to importin-α3 in vitro, while Lys239substitution mutations and acetylation of E1A by CBP abrogate this interaction. These results indicate that acetylation of E1A determines subcellular localization by interfering with nuclear import. Acetylation of E1A may act to either attenuate the nuclear functions of E1A or redirect a portion of 12 E1A to cytoplasmic targets. These results raise the possibility that E1A may exert its pleiotropic effects on cellular transformation in part by affecting cytoplasmic processes. Mammalian expression pRc/RSV-derived expression plasmids for wild type adenovirus type 2 12 S E1A protein (243R), CBP, CREB341, and the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A have been previously described (8Lundblad J.R. Kwok R.P. Laurance M.E. Harter M.L. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1995; 374: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Individual cDNAs encoding wild-type adenovirus type 5 13 S E1A protein (289R) and deletion mutants mCR1 (deletion of amino acids 38–65), mCR2 (deletion of amino acids 125–133), and mCR3 (deletion of amino acids 140–185), obtained from Dr. Ganes Sen (Cleveland Clinic), were inserted into pRc/RSV (Invitrogen) by PCR (41Kalvakolanu D.V.

Site-directed mutagenesis at lysine 239 in 12 S E1A or the corresponding lysine 285 in 13 S E1A was performed by using the QuikChangeTM system (Stratagene). Eukaryotic Rc/RSV expression vectors for wild type 12 S E1A and K239A 12 S E1A with the carboxyl-terminal fusion of the SV40 T-antigen nuclear localization signal (-PKKKRKV) (42Kalderon D.

A plasmid for expression of histidine-tagged E1A in Escherichia coli was constructed by cloning the 12 S E1A cDNA in-frame into pET23d (Novagen) by PCR. A bacterial expression plasmid for expression of a GST fusion protein with full-length CtBP1 (pGST-CtBP1) was constructed by cloning the full-length cDNA for human CtBP1 (derived from pT7-CtBP1; generously provided by Dr. G. Chinnadurai, St. Louis University) in frame into pGEX-GK (43Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar) by PCR.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), provided by Dr. Mattias Kohler, was inserted into pGEX-GK by PCR. DNA constructs and mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Wild type and mutant 12 S E1A proteins were expressed from a pET23d-derived 12 S E1A cDNA expression plasmid inE. coli BL21 (DE3) pT-Trx (45Yasukawa T. Kanei-Ishii C. Maekawa T. Fujimoto J.

Cells were grown to log phase, induced with 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and harvested after 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were lysed by two passages through a French pressure cell at 14,000 p.s.i. (SLM-Aminico), and lysates were cleared of insoluble cellular debris by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min. E1A partially purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen Inc.) was further purified by Q-Sepharose anion exchange column chromatography. GST fusion proteins for full-length CtBP1 (GST-CtBP1) and importin-α3 (GST-importin-α3) were expressed in E. coli DH5α and purified essentially as previously described (43Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). The full-length murine CBP cDNA (46Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar), with two copies of the FLAG epitope at the carboxyl terminus (CBP-2×FLAG), was cloned into pFastBac1, and recombinant baculovirus producing epitope-tagged full-length CBP was produced in Sf9 cells according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bac-to-Bac; Invitrogen). CBP-2×FLAG was purified by α-FLAG M2 immunoaffinity chromatography, followed by elution with FLAG peptide (Sigma) as previously described (47Brizzard B.L. Chubet R.G. Vizard D.L. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 730-735PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of eluted CBP was greater than 95% as determined by Coomassie staining. E1A was acetylated in vitroin a reaction containing 5 μm purified 12 S E1A, 300 nm CBP-2×FLAG, 10 μm[14C]acetyl coenzyme A ([acetyl-1-14C]; 2.2 GBq/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 10 mm sodium butyrate, 1 mmdithiothreitol, for 3 h at 30 °C. Monoclonal antibody M2 directed against the FLAG epitope coupled to agarose was obtained from Sigma. Mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against E1A, M73, M1, M37, and M29 (48Harlow E. Whyte P. Franza Jr., B.R. Schley C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1579-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), were a generous gift of Dr. E. Harlow. An α-tubulin monoclonal antibody (T-9026) was from Sigma. A synthetic peptide corresponding to the C terminus of Ad2 E1A, designed with an additional N-terminal cysteine (-CEDLLNESGNPLDLSCK 239RPRP243;acetylated at the ε-amino position of lysine 239) was obtained from Sigma, purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Peptide was coupled to maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Imject; Pierce), mixed with Freund's adjuvant, and injected into mice. Sera from injected mice were screened for immunoreactivity toward recombinant E1A acetylated in vitro by CBP. Mice with high titer immunoreactivity for acetylated E1A were sacrificed to obtain splenocytes for hybridoma fusion by standard procedures (49Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 148-237Google Scholar). Clonal hybridoma supernatants were screened by Western blot for selective immunoreactivity toward acetylated E1A. Monolayer cultures of U2OS cells, COS-7 cells, and HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. COS-7 and U2OS cells were transfected with E1A expression vectors using the TransIT reagent (PanVera, Madison, WI). Assay of E1A-mediated repression of CBP-dependent co-activation of the somatostatin promoter was performed as previously described (8Lundblad J.R. Kwok R.P. Laurance M.E. Harter M.L. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1995; 374: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). In brief, F9 teratocarcinoma cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method (Calcium Phosphate Transfection Kit; Invitrogen) using 4 μg of p(−71) SRIF-CAT, 4 μg of pRc/RSV-FLAG-CREB341, 4 μg of pRSV-PKA, and 2 μg of pRSV-Luciferase, with or without 15 μg of pRc/RSV-CBP per 10-cm plate, with 1, 5, or 10 μg of plasmids encoding pRc/RSV-12 S E1A and 12 S E1A mutants as indicated. Results are expressed as the relative CAT activity (mean ± S.E., n = 3) compared with CAT activity in the presence of CREB and protein kinase A alone (CREB alone column). CAT activity values were normalized to luciferase activity as previously described (50Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Transfected COS-7 cells and 293 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 4 min at room temperature, incubated with ice-cold methanol/acetone (1:1) for 2 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline prior to incubation with E1A-specific antibodies. E1A was detected with either M73 alone (a carboxyl-terminal, E1A-specific monoclonal antibody), a mixture of E1A-specific antibodies (M1, M29, M37, and M73) that recognize multiple E1A epitopes (48Harlow E. Whyte P. Franza Jr., B.R. Schley C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1579-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), or the α-AcK-E1A monoclonal antibody and then detected with an Oregon Green 488-goat anti-mouse IgG conjugate (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Nuclei were counterstained with TOPRO-3 (Molecular Probes). Coverslips were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and viewed by either conventional fluorescence microscopy or on a Nikon TE 300-inverted microscope with a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal imaging system. Whole cellular extracts were prepared as previously described (8Lundblad J.R. Kwok R.P. Laurance M.E. Harter M.L. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1995; 374: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). For preparation of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts, cells were harvested and washed in phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 3 mm MgCl2 (TM) with 250 mm sucrose and lysed with a Dounce homogenizer (B pestle). Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 250 ×g, and the supernatant (cytosol) was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min (Beckman TLA100.2) to pellet cellular membranes. Nuclei were washed twice and then brought to 0.6m sucrose and layered over a solution of 1.7 msucrose in TM and centrifuged at 28,000 rpm in a SW-28 rotor (Beckman) for 2 h. The purified nuclear pellet was washed twice in TM + 250 mm sucrose. Nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (51Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were probed with a monoclonal α-tubulin antibody to confirm adequate fractionation. Total protein concentrations were determined by Bradford Reagent (Bio-Rad). Cellular proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore Corp.), and detected by incubation with antibodies as described for each experiment, by using a goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad) and enhanced luminol reagent (Renaissance; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). GST-CtBP1 and GST-importin-α3 binding assays were performed in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml nuclease-free bovine serum albumin (New England Biolabs). Each 200-μl binding reaction contained 10 nm GST-importin-α3, 20–30 nm GST-CtBP1, and 10 μl of a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose beads and increasing concentrations of purified E1A protein as indicated. Reactions were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Glutathione-Sepharose-bound proteins were washed with binding buffer, and complexes were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, and subjected to Western blot analysis using either a panel of E1A-specific monoclonal antibodies or the acetyl-E1A-specific monoclonal antibody. Previous studies have demonstrated that the nuclear histone acetyltransferases acetylate not only free and nucleosomal histones but also nonhistone transcriptional regulatory proteins (reviewed in Refs. 52Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar and 53Sterner D.E. Berger S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 435-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). E1A is also a substrate for the acetylase activity of CBP, p300, and P/CAF in vitro (17Chakravarti D. Ogryzko V. Kao H.Y. Nash A. Chen H. Nakatani Y. Evans R.M.

CBP-dependent acetylation of 12 S E1A shows similar substrate concentration saturation kinetics as purified H3 and H4 histones (not shown), consistent with the ability of E1A to competitively inhibit acetylation of purified histones in vitro (16Hamamori Y.

To determine the consequences of acetylation on the function of 12 S E1A, we mapped the site of acetylation by mutagenesis of three potential target lysine residues (Lys162, Lys207, Lys239). Consistent with previous results obtained with p300 and P/CAF (34Zhang Q. Yao H., Vo, N. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14323-14328Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we find that E1A is predominantly acetylated at a single lysine residue (Lys239) in vitro at the C terminus (Fig.1 B). Recombinant wild type 12 E1A or E1A proteins with single amino acid substitutions at each of three lysine residues were incubated with baculovirus-expressed recombinant CBP in the presence of [14C]acetyl-coenzyme A, and radiolabeled E1A was detected by autoradiography. Wild type E1A, E1A K162A, and E1A K207A are acetylated by CBP in vitro, whereas E1A K239A is not significantly acetylated by CBP (Fig.1 B). Since mutation of Lys239 could impair E1A acetylation by CBP indirectly by disturbing acetylation at another site, we developed a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for E1A acetylated at Lys239 ([ε-acetyl-K239]-E1A) to confirm that Lys239 is a bona fide acetylation site bothin vitro and in vivo. Mice were immunized with a peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 16 amino acids of Ad2 E1A synthesized with ε-acetyl-lysine at a position corresponding to Lys239 (Fig. 1 C). Clonal hybridoma lines were identified that were specifically reactive to in vitroacetylated full-length 12 S E1A. Fig. 1 D shows the specificity of one of these antibodies (monoclonal antibody 327.5.1) by Western blot analysis for 12 S E1A acetylated in vitro by recombinant CBP. To demonstrate that this site is a target for acetylation of E1A in vivo, we transfected either COS-7 cells (Fig. 1 E) or U2OS cells (Fig. 1 F) with expression vectors for either wild type 12 or 13 S E1A, E1A with deletion mutations within each conserved region (mCR1, mCR2, mCR3) and the N terminus (Δ2–36), or cDNAs with point mutations in the CtBP binding motif (D235A/L236S) or at lysine 239 (K239A and K239Q).

LGA has long been believed to be present only in liver mitochondria from adult animals. However, we have recently reported the presence of LGA mRNA in human brain. We now describe the expression of LGA mRNA in the brain of other mammals (cow, mouse, rabbit, and rat) and in different areas of human brain as assessed by Northern blot analysis. The presence of mRNA encoding for this isoform in rat brain was further confirmed by reverse transcriptase-PCR cloning and sequencing. Although it has been well accepted that glutaminase is a mitochondrial enzyme, using newly generated isoform-specific antibodies, we have found a differential intracellular immunolocalization of both glutaminase isoforms in rat and monkey brain. In both species, KGA protein was present in mitochondria, whereas LGA protein was localized in nuclei. Furthermore, subcellular fractionation and Western blot analysis revealed that brain LGA was enriched in nuclei where it was catalytically active. Nuclear glutaminase exhibited a kinetic behavior that resembles that of the liver-type enzyme with regard to the low phosphate concentration requirement; however, nuclear glutaminase was susceptible to glutamate inhibition, a property that is absent in the rat liver enzyme.

Not surprisingly glutamate receptors are among the most studied and best understood molecules of the nervous system (1Watkins J.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 297-310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, understanding the mechanisms by which glutamate plays its role in diverse processes requires not only the detailed knowledge of the implicated postsynaptic receptors but also of the enzymes involved in the production of glutamate in the presynaptic neurons. Phosphate-activated glutaminase (GA,1 EC 3.5.1.2), an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of glutamine to glutamate, has been considered as a major enzyme for the production of neurotransmitter glutamate (2Nicklas W.J. Zeevalk G. Hyndman A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1987; 15: 208-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In mammals, there are two different genes encoding for GA, known as liver (LGA) and kidney (KGA) types (3Aledo J.C. Gómez-Fabre P.M. Olalla L. Márquez J. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 1107-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Both enzymatic forms of GA display different kinetic and molecular characteristics (4Curthoys N.P. Watford M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 133-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). In rat, LGA is believed to be present only in liver mitochondria from adult animals, whereas K-type enzymes are found in all other rat tissues with GA activity, including brain (5Smith E.M. Watford M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10631-10636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, we have previously reported that human brain expresses transcripts for both isoenzymes KGA (3Aledo J.C. Gómez-Fabre P.M. Olalla L. Márquez J. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 1107-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and LGA (6Gómez-Fabre P.M. Aledo J.C. del Castillo-Olivares A. Alonso F.J. Campos J.A. Núñez de Castro I. Márquez J. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Now we have generated isoform-specific antibodies and cDNA probes to study the expression of both glutaminase isoforms in the brain of diverse mammalian species. Our results suggest a nuclear localization of the LGA protein, which is catalytically active and displays kinetic properties different from both the liver and kidney glutaminases. KGA (nt 841–1791) and LGA-specific (nt 1118–1896) probes were prepared by restriction of the human cDNA clones HK03864 (7Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Suyama M. Kikuno R. Hirosawa M. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and hGAZR75 (6Gómez-Fabre P.M. Aledo J.C. del Castillo-Olivares A. Alonso F.J. Campos J.A. Núñez de Castro I. Márquez J. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), respectively. The regional expression of K- and L-type mRNAs in human brain was determined by hybridization of 32P-labeled probes to commercially available Northern blots of poly(A)+ mRNAs (Clontech). Poly(A)+ mRNA from whole cow, chicken, mouse, rabbit, and rat brain were purchased from Sigma or Clontech, fractionated, and processed as described previously (8Aledo J.C. Segura J.A. Medina M.A. Alonso F.J. Núñez de Castro I. Márquez J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As an internal standard, the mRNA for β-actin was detected using a mouse cDNA (Ambion). Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription of poly(A)+ from rat brain by using SuperScript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and the antisense primer 5′-TCCAAGAGGCCACCACTGCTGGAC-3′ (nt 316–293, GenBankTM accession no. NM_138904). The cDNA was subsequently subjected to PCR for 30 cycles with primers deduced from the rat LGA cDNA: forward (nt 67–89), 5′-GAGGGGCATCCTCAGGCTCCTGC-3′; and reverse (nt 276–257), 5′-GCATCTTGCTCATGCAGTCC-3′. A 596-bp fragment, encoding for the last 119 amino acids of the KGA protein, was obtained by PCR using the human clone HK03864 (7Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Suyama M. Kikuno R. Hirosawa M. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) as template and the primers 5′-GAAGGTGGGGATCCAAGGGTAAAGTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGTAATATTGCTAAGCTTATGGAGGG-3′ (reverse). This PCR product, containing BamHI and HindIII restriction sites, was cloned into the pQE-31 vector to express inEscherichia coli a His-tagged recombinant protein (KGA-(551–669)), which was purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. The whole coding sequence of KGA was also expressed in E. coli as a fusion protein (GST-KGA) using the pGEX-6P-1 vector. The whole coding sequence of human LGA was expressed in E. coli as a recombinant protein (LGA-(1–602)) and as a fusion protein (GST-LGA) using the vectors pET-3c and pGEX-4T-1, respectively. In all the cases, the purified proteins were used for hyperimmunization of two New Zealand White rabbits for each immunogen, and polyclonal antibodies were generated as described elsewhere (9Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 1-138Google Scholar). Three non-overlapping peptides 20–24 residues long, corresponding to different regions through the complete human LGA (6Gómez-Fabre P.M. Aledo J.C. del Castillo-Olivares A. Alonso F.J. Campos J.A. Núñez de Castro I. Márquez J. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), were synthesized. They are noted with two numbers that indicate the position on the primary structure of the first and the last residues of the peptide. They correspond to the following sequence segments: LGA-(311–333), LGA-(462–485), and LGA-(583–602). Before immunization, the peptides were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin using standard methods (9Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 1-138Google Scholar). Five to ten milligrams of the recombinant proteins (KGA-(551–669) or LGA-(1–602)) or 3–5 mg of the LGA-(583–602) peptide were coupled to a CNBr-activated Sepharose 6MB gel according to the manufacturer's manual (Amersham Biosciences) and used for affinity purification of their respective antisera as described elsewhere (9Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 1-138Google Scholar). For preadsorption experiments, the working dilution of the antibodies contained 150 μg of the antigenic recombinant protein or peptide. Isolated rat brains (7–8 g) were added to 4 volumes of buffer A (0.25 m sucrose, 3 mm CaCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and homogenized by 18 strokes in a Teflon/glass homogenizer. All subsequent procedures were carried out as described previously (10Tanigawa Y. Kitamura A. Kawamura M. Shimoyama M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 92: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The protein content in each fraction was measured using the Bradford method (11Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 71: 248-254Crossref Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c oxidase and phosphate-activated glutaminase were assayed by standard enzymic methods (12Aledo J.C. de Pedro E. Gómez-Fabre P.M. Núñez de Castro I. Márquez J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1323: 173-184Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 13Heini H.G. Gebhardt R. Brecht A. Mecke D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 162: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Western blotting was carried out essentially as described elsewhere (14Aledo J.C. Rosado A. Olalla L. Campos J.A. Márquez J. Protein Expr. Purif. 2001; 23: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and the blots were developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence technique as recommended by the supplier (Amersham Biosciences). Adult male rats (Sprague-Dawley) and macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were deeply anesthetized and perfused transcardially with phosphate-buffered saline followed by ice-cold fixative solution (4% paraformaldehyde, 75 mmlysine, and 10 mm sodium metaperiodate for the rat and 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde, and 15% saturated picric acid solution for the monkey). Fixed brains were processed as described previously (15Khan Z.U. Mrzljak L. Gutiérrez A. de la Calle A. Goldman-Rakic P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7731-7736Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Free floating sections, after blocking the endogenous peroxidase activity, avidin, biotin, and biotin-binding proteins, were incubated with one of the affinity-purified anti-glutaminase antibodies (anti-KGA at 1:500 or anti-LGA at 1:10) for 48 h at room temperature and processed by the avidin-biotin method using biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Labs, 1:500) and ExtraAvidin-peroxidase conjugate (Sigma, 1:2000). Immunoreaction product was visualized with 0.05% diaminobenzidine, 0.03% nickel ammonium sulfate, and 0.01% H2O2. For the double immunofluorescence labeling, sections were incubated with anti-KGA and a monoclonal anti-mitochondria antibody (16Billet E.E. Jun B. Mayer J. Biochem. J. 1984; 221: 765-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and visualized with Alexa 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa 568 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:1000, Molecular Probes), respectively. In addition, double fluorescence labeling was carried out with anti-LGA using Alexa 488 anti-rabbit IgG and propidium iodide (4 μg/ml) for 10 min to visualized nuclei. Finally we performed double immunoperoxidase labeling to co-localize KGA and LGA. For this, sections were incubated first in anti-KGA and processed as described above for single labeling. After incubation with diaminobenzidine/nickel, sections were treated for 45 min with 1% H2O2 in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with anti-LGA. This second labeling reaction was performed with the peroxidase-anti-peroxidase method and visualized only with diaminobenzidine. All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals and approved by the committee of animal use for research at Málaga University. All efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used and their suffering. Fig. 1 shows the regional distribution of both messengers in human brain as assessed by Northern blot analyses using isoform-specific probes. The mRNA encoding LGA was present in all regions of the brain examined (Fig. 1 A,middle panel). The strongest signal was seen in poly(A)+ mRNA extracted from the cerebral cortex; substantial labeling was observed in the cerebellum, and less was observed in the putamen. A weak hybridization signal was also revealed in the lanes containing mRNAs from the medulla and spinal cord when the exposure time was prolonged for more than 36 h (not shown). A similar pattern of expression was found for the KGA mRNA (Fig.1 A, top panel). The transcripts of both isoforms possess very different molecular sizes (∼5 and 2.4–2.8 kb for the KGA and LGA mRNA, respectively); this fact rules out the possibility that the results presented in Fig. 1 may be due to cross-hybridization between the LGA probe and the KGA mRNA and vice versa. This pattern of expression seemed to contrast with that previously reported for the rat (5Smith E.M. Watford M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10631-10636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we next investigated whether other mammalian species showed co-expression of both GA isoforms in brain. Northern blots of mRNA from whole cow, chicken, mouse, rabbit, and rat brain were analyzed. The kidney-type glutaminase cDNA probe detected transcripts in all species, including chicken (Fig. 1 B, top panel). When these samples were probed for LGA under stringent conditions, two close bands of 2.4–2.8 kb were detected in all of the mammals analyzed but not in chicken (Fig. 1 B, middle panel). Surprisingly, rat brain showed transcripts with the electrophoretic mobility expected for the LGA mRNAs and that did hybridize specifically with the LGA cDNA probe. Because this result was in conflict with the generally accepted idea that, at least in rat, the expression of LGA is restricted to the adult liver, we further investigated the presence of LGA mRNA in rat brain by RT-PCR. A PCR product of the expected size (210 bp) was obtained (Fig. 1 C), cloned in pGEMT, and sequenced. Comparison of the sequence of this insert with that of the cDNA for rat LGA (GenBankTM accession no. NM_138904) gave a 100% identity with the exception of a nucleotide duplication at position 24 of the PCR product (Fig. 1 D). To confirm the presence of both glutaminase protein isoforms and to carry out a comparative study of the cellular and subcellular localization of these isoenzymes, we developed a battery of antibodies (see “Materials and Methods”). To assess potential cross-reactivity of our LGA antisera against KGA and vice versa, we immunoblotted proteins from rat liver and kidney samples as well as the recombinant fusion proteins GST-LGA and GST-KGA. The ability to recognize the LGA but not the KGA antigen was used as a criteria to designate a serum as LGA-specific and vice versa (Fig.2 A). Antibodies anti-KGA-(551–669), anti-LGA-(583–602), and anti-LGA-(1–602) were selected for subsequent experiments because they had a higher isoform-specific signal-to-noise ratio than the others. Despite the high degree of similarity between the amino acid sequences of KGA and LGA, anti-LGA-(1–602) specifically recognized the LGA protein and was unable to detect the KGA protein (Fig. 2 A, right panel). This specificity was further verified by preadsorption experiments. The immunoreactivity observed against recombinant LGA proteins was completely abolished when the antiserum anti-LGA-(1–602) was preincubated with the antigenic protein LGA-(1–602). Moreover, the fusion protein GST-KGA failed to preadsorb the anti-LGA serum (Fig. 2 B) but succeeded in preadsorbing the anti-KGA antibody (result not shown). The distribution of the KGA and LGA proteins in rat and monkey brain was studied by light microscopy immunocytochemistry using affinity-purified antibodies. Immunoreactive patterns were the same regardless of the species under consideration. Fig.3, A–C, shows a high immunoreactivity in the cerebral cortex according to the high mRNA levels found in human brain for both isoforms. Examination under higher magnification revealed a cytoplasmic particulate immunoreactivity pattern for the KGA antigen, strongly suggestive of a mitochondrial localization (Fig. 3, E and F). This location of the KGA protein was confirmed by double immunofluorescence labeling with anti-KGA and anti-mitochondria antibodies using laser scanning confocal microscopy (Fig. 3, I–K). However, LGA immunoreactivity was concentrated in neuronal nuclei (Fig.3 D). The same results were obtained with anti-LGA-(311–333), anti-LGA-(462–485), and anti-LGA-(583–602) (results not shown). Moreover, preadsorption of the antibodies with LGA-(1–602) completely abolished the immunoreactivity in brain sections, confirming the specificity of the antibodies (results not shown). Interestingly, double labeling images (anti-LGA/propidium iodide) indicated that many, but not all, cell nuclei exhibited LGA immunoreactivity (Fig. 3,L–N). Double labeling for KGA and LGA revealed that both isoforms co-localize in numerous cells throughout the brain (Fig. 3,G and H). To assess whether the LGA protein found in the nucleus was a catalytically active enzyme, we performed subcellular fractionation on brain from adult rat. Western blot analysis revealed that LGA was enriched in nuclei relative to crude homogenate (Fig. 4 A,right panel), further supporting the specific localization of this protein in the nucleus of brain cells. In contrast, KGA was detected in crude homogenate but was absent from the nuclear fraction, consistent with the notion that KGA is restricted to the mitochondrial compartment (17Laake J.H. Takumi Y Bidet J. Torgner I.A. Roberg B. Kvamme E. Ottersen O.P. Neuroscience. 1999; 88: 1137-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cytochrome c oxidase activity, a mitochondrial marker (12Aledo J.C. de Pedro E. Gómez-Fabre P.M. Núñez de Castro I. Márquez J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1323: 173-184Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar), was undetectable when assayed in the nuclear fraction even though high amounts of total protein (up to 255 μg) were used. Nevertheless, a high cytochrome coxidase activity was detected in crude extracts (not shown). The absence of KGA immunoreactivity and cytochrome c oxidase activity in the nuclear fractions indicated that the purified nuclei were essentially free of mitochondrial contamination. We next investigated the capacity of these purified nuclei to catalyze the hydrolysis of the amide group of l-glutamine. These nuclear preparations exhibited a considerable phosphate-activated specific activity (0.14 ± 0.01 μmol/mg of protein/min). As mentioned above, the kidney- and liver-type glutaminases display differential kinetic properties. Therefore, we addressed whether it may be possible to discriminate, by kinetic analyses, the GA activity found in nuclei from that detected in crude homogenates. Fig. 4 Bshows the effect of glutamate and phosphate concentrations on nuclear GA activity. The sensitivity for activation by phosphate of nuclear glutaminase was consistent with that expected for a LGA enzyme. At low phosphate concentration (10 mm), the glutaminase activity detected in nuclei was 78 ± 3% of that exhibited at high phosphate concentration (200 mm). This percentage was reduced to 28 ± 4% when crude homogenates were assayed. On the other hand, nuclear GA showed a strong and unexpected inhibition by glutamate (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, only a slight decrease (18%) in activity was found when a liver crude homogenate was used as control (result not shown). For many years the expression of LGA was believed to be restricted to the liver of postnatal animals (4Curthoys N.P. Watford M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 133-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 18Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1935; 29: 1951-1969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently we have reported the presence of LGA mRNA in human brain (6Gómez-Fabre P.M. Aledo J.C. del Castillo-Olivares A. Alonso F.J. Campos J.A. Núñez de Castro I. Márquez J. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In this work, we have confirmed and further extended our initial finding. The occurrence of LGA mRNA in the mammalian brain has been demonstrated by Northern analysis and RT-PCR, while the presence of LGA protein was proved by immunocytochemistry and Western analysis. An earlier report of tissue distribution based on Northern blot analysis showed that LGA was absent in non-hepatic rat tissues (5Smith E.M. Watford M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10631-10636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The difference with our results was probably due to the fact that total RNA instead of mRNA was used; in addition, blot washes were performed at higher temperatures. In agreement with the presence of mRNA encoding for the LGA enzyme in mammalian brain, we were able to detect the LGA protein in rat and monkey brain. Since glutamine serves as an oxidative substrate in most cells, the wide distribution of glutaminase throughout the human brain was not unexpected. Nevertheless, glutaminase was highly concentrated in the cerebral cortex, which is consistent with glutamate as a major excitatory neurotransmitter of projection neurons in this area. An excellent correlation between the KGA and LGA expression patterns was observed at the regional and cellular level. The co-expression in the mammalian brain of two GAs raises the intriguing question of why two isoenzymes are needed. In addition to its role in neurotransmission, glutamate participates in multiple metabolic pathways. Therefore, glutamate production must be a process exquisitely regulated to ensure a proper glutamate function. Although the need for two GAs is so far unexplained, it may represent the biochemical basis to achieve this fine tuning under different physiological circumstances. Besides the presence of LGA mRNA in mammalian brain, the main finding of this study is the nuclear localization revealed for LGA protein, which was previously thought to be exclusively a mitochondrial enzyme (4Curthoys N.P. Watford M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 133-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Three arguments support this unexpected location. First, all anti-LGA antibodies used, regardless of whether they were directed to different peptides or elicited against the whole protein, gave the same nuclear pattern of staining in brain of two different species: monkey and rat. On the other hand, preadsorption of the affinity-purified antibodies with the protein/peptide used as immunogen completely abolished the immunoreactivity in brain sections, confirming the specificity of the antibodies. Second, subcellular fractionation on rat brain showed an enrichment of the LGA protein in nuclei with regard to crude homogenate from whole brain. Finally, isolated nuclei exhibited a phosphate-activated glutaminase activity that cannot be assigned to KGA, which was absent from the nuclear preparations. There are a growing number of examples of proteins that function in more than one subcellular compartment (19Soltys B.J. Gupta R.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 174-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which LGA enters the nucleus at present is unclear because LGA lacks any known targeting signal specific for the nucleus. However, recent findings have established the importance of PDZ domain-containing proteins in localization to the nucleus (20Balda M.S. Matter K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2024-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 21Hsueh Y.-P. Wang T.-F. Yang F.-C. Sheng M. Nature. 2000; 404: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 22Hogan A.

Firestein B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48262-48268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and we have reported the ability of the C terminus of LGA to mediate its association with PDZ domain-containing proteins (24Olalla L. Aledo J.C. Bannenberg G. Márquez J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 488: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that LGA may reach the nucleus through interactions with other proteins, although this hypothesis remains to be explored. Nevertheless, translocation of a mitochondrial enzyme, lacking a specific nuclear targeting signal, to the nucleus is not without precedent. Mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase has been detected in nuclei. Nuclear translocation of mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase seems to involve interaction with nuclear hormone receptors through the LXXLL motif present in the mitochondrial enzyme (25Meertens L.M. Miyata K.S. Cechetto J.D. Rachubinski R.A. Capone J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6972-6978Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The LXXLL motif is a signature sequence that facilitates the interaction of different proteins with nuclear receptors (26Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). Strikingly, LGA contains one such consensus motif, LGDLL, at positions 5–9 of the rat protein sequence; whether this short motif is necessary and sufficient to mediate the interaction between LGA and some nuclear receptor is an issue that we are currently addressing. Interestingly, there is a growing body of evidence pointing to glutamine as a signal molecule involved in gene expression. For example, glutamine, but not glutamate or ammonium, leads to increased levels of Hsp72 mRNA and protein. It is noteworthy that the non-metabolizable glutamine analog 6-diazo-5-oxonorleucine mimics the effects of glutamine on Hsp expression, indicating that glutamine by itself may function as a transcription signal (for review, see Ref.27Wishmeyer P.E. Nutrition. 2002; 18: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, the identity of the protein target for glutamine remains elusive. In this context, a working hypothesis could be outlined. This is based upon the following circumstantial evidence: (i) the existence of a LXXLL motif in the N-terminal region of LGA, (ii) the ability of the C terminus of LGA to interact with PDZ domain-containing proteins (24Olalla L. Aledo J.C. Bannenberg G. Márquez J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 488: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and (iii) the fact that this protein-protein interaction can affect glutaminase activity (14Aledo J.C. Rosado A. Olalla L. Campos J.A. Márquez J. Protein Expr. Purif. 2001; 23: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is tempting to postulate that LGA may form part of a transcriptional complex as a coregulator and that the conversion of glutamine to glutamate, after glutaminase activation, may facilitate the association/dissociation to/from nuclear receptors, particularly in light of the evidence of rapid turnover of receptor interactions (28Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36865-36868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). In this way, nuclear LGA may bridge the current gap between the glutamine signal and the transcriptional machinery. Alternatively, the protein fulfilling this function may be other than glutaminase. In this case, the significance of the nuclear LGA localization could be as simple as being an enzyme controlling in situ the glutamine levels in the nucleoplasm and therefore being indirectly involved in the expression of glutamine-regulated genes. In summary, we have shown that LGA is expressed in the mammalian brain with a nuclear localization and that this nuclear enzyme is catalytically active and displays kinetic properties different from both liver and kidney glutaminases. These findings open a new avenue of research on how glutamine may affect neuronal function. We are indebted to Drs.

As expected the protein fold is similar to previously reported sPLA2 structures. The active site architecture, including the positions of the catalytic residues and the first and second shell water around the Ca2+ cofactor, are highly conserved and remarkably similar to the group IB and group IIA enzymes. Differences are seen in the structures following the (1–12)-N-terminal helix and at the C terminus. These regions are proposed to interact with the substrate membrane surface. The opening to the active site slot is considerably larger in hGX than in human group IIA sPLA2. Furthermore, the electrostatic surface potential of the hGX interfacial-binding surface does not resemble that of the human group IIA sPLA2; the former is highly neutral, whereas the latter is highly cationic.

In contrast, hGX does not show activation by the anionic charge at the lipid interface when acting on phospholipid vesicles or short-chain phospholipid micelles.

These 14–18-kDa disulfide-rich proteins require Ca2+ as a catalytic cofactor for the hydrolysis of the sn-2 ester of glycerophospholipids at the interface. For the past 4 decades the 14-kDa pancreatic group IB sPLA2 has been a paradigm for interfacial enzymes that exhibit processive turnover at the substrate interface (3Verheij H.M. Slotboom A.J. de Haas G.H. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1981; 91: 91-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 4Berg O.G. Jain M.K. Interfacial Enzyme Kinetics.

The other sPLA2 family members are of interest because they often act in concert with intracellular 87-kDa phospholipase A2 to liberate arachidonic acid from cellular phospholipids as the substrate for the eicosanoid pathways (6Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Atsumi G. Inoue K. Kudo I. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 17: 225-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kudo I. Murakami M. Hara S. Inoue K. Biochim. Biophys.

Toxicol. 1999; 39: 175-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). We are now faced with the challenge of understanding the physiological functions of the full set of mammalian sPLA2s. The fact that each of these enzymes has distinct expression profiles and tissue distributions argues that they do not have redundant functions, although such functions remain to be established. Also, the tissue distribution of a particular human sPLA2 is often distinct from that of its mouse ortholog (1Valentin E. Lambeau G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Thus, one cannot always infer the function of a human sPLA2 from genetic studies with sPLA2-deficient mice. It appears that, coupled with biochemical characterization of their function, highly selective inhibitors for each sPLA2 gene product could facilitate the search for their specific physiological functions.A portion of the gene that codes for the human group X sPLA2 (hGX) was identified in GenBankTM, and the full-length sequence was obtained from a fetal lung cDNA library (9Cupillard L. Koumanov K. Mattei M.G. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15745-15752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). This sPLA2 contains a disulfide pattern that is a combination of some of the unique disulfides found in group I and II sPLA2s. Furthermore, hGX lacks the loops that are characteristic of the pancreatic and elapid snake enzymes, and was therefore given the unique name group X (9Cupillard L. Koumanov K. Mattei M.G. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15745-15752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The mRNA for hGX was found in spleen, thymus, peripheral blood leukocytes, and to a lesser extent in pancreas, lung, and colon cells (9Cupillard L. Koumanov K. Mattei M.G. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15745-15752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Unlike the group IB and IIA sPLA2s that display significant preference for vesicles of anionic phospholipids (10Jain M.K. Ranadive G. Yu B.Z. Verheij H.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7330-7340Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), hGX is able to hydrolyze phosphatidylcholine-rich vesicles at a rate comparable with its action on anionic phospholipid vesicles (11Bezzine S. Koduri R.S. Valentin E. Murakami M. Kudo I. Ghomashchi F. Sadilek M. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3179-3191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). As a result, hGX is able to potently release arachidonic acid when added exogenously to the phosphatidylcholine-rich extracellular face of the plasma membrane of a variety of mammalian cells (11Bezzine S. Koduri R.S. Valentin E. Murakami M. Kudo I. Ghomashchi F. Sadilek M. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. J. Biol.

Fujii N. Ishizaki J. Arita H. Hanasaki K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 381: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Based on this specificity profile, hGX has been implicated to play a critical role in the arachidonic acid-mediated cyclooxygenase-2 pathway during colon carcinogenesis (14Morioka Y. Ikeda M. Saiga A. Fujii N. Ishimoto Y. Arita H. Hanasaki K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 487: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). There are dramatically different affinities of the various sPLA2s for membrane surfaces containing different phospholipids. This is likely to be controlled by the amino acid differences that lie on their interfacial binding surfaces (i-face) rather than the substrate affinity controlled by the active site residues. The i-face is the nearly planar surface of sPLA2s that surrounds the opening to the active site slot. The later is a ∼15-Å deep pocket of sPLA2s where a single phospholipid molecule must enter to reach the catalytic residues necessary for ester bond hydrolysis (5Berg O.G. Gelb M.H. Tsai M.D. Jain M.K. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2613-2653Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 15Scott D.L. White S.P. Otwinowski Z. Yuan W. Gelb M.H. Sigler P.B.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 609-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).The goal of the present study was to obtain structural information of the hGX enzyme to provide clues into its substrate and interface specificity, mode of interfacial activation, and most importantly its physiological function. Here we report the 1.97-Å crystal structure of a ligand-free form of hGX as a prelude to understanding the i-face residues that allow its relatively high affinity for phosphatidylcholine-rich membranes. We also gain insight into structure-based design of inhibitors that are selective for this sPLA2. Attempts were made to obtain the structure with and without the active- site inhibitor 1-hexadecyl-3-(trifluoroethyl)- sn-glycero-2-phosphomethanol (MJ33) (18Jain M.K. Tao W.J. Rogers J. Arenson C. Eibl H. Yu B.Z. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10256-10268Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Two crystal forms were obtained that led to independent structures of hGX, both without bound inhibitor.RESULTSStructural features of the 1.97-Å crystal structure of a ligand-free form of hGX are described and interpreted in relation to its functional characteristics. The statistics of the x-ray data collection and refinement of two crystal forms of hGX are summarized in Table I. As expected the protein fold of hGX was quite similar to previously reported sPLA2structures. The predicted disulfide-bonding pattern (9Cupillard L. Koumanov K. Mattei M.G. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15745-15752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) that led to the classification of hGX as a group X enzyme has been confirmed to contain 8 disulfide bonds. Beyond predictions of a novel protein fold, other potential structural differences can be predicted by gazing at a sequence alignment of sPLA2 family members, as shown in Fig. 1. The hGX enzyme was between 29 and 41% identical to other members of the 14-kDa family of sPLA2 enzymes. Residues that were part of the active site were highly conserved, and as expected, the active site of the hGX structure was remarkably similar to the previously solved group IB (29Steiner R.A.

However, there were noticeable differences in the hGX structure, relative to the group IB and IIA enzymes, and in the i-face binding surface. The associated active site slot provides significant insights into the functional differences between these paralogs. These structural observations provide a framework to understand the substrate preference and kinetic differences observed for hGX compared with the group IB and IIA enzymes.Table IX-ray data collection and refinement of hGX sPLA2 ligand free structureshGX crystal formhGX (no MJ33)hGX (with MJ33)Crystal dataSpace groupP21C2221Cell parametersa (Å)51.2139.1b (Å)62.1145.1c(Å)70.428.1β (°)99.3Subunits/asymmetric unit32X-ray dataTotal reflections337,721184,444Unique reflections34,47519,931Resolution limit (Å)1.902.00Completeness (%)99.895.8R merge1-aRmerge = Σ‖I o −I a‖/(I a), whereI o is the observed intensity andI a is the average intensity, the sums being taken over all symmetry related reflections.

Open table in a new tab Active Site Coordination of hGXThe active site of the hGX structure for crystals of both crystal forms (P21 and C2221) are shown in Fig. 2. The ligand-free structure of hGX (Fig. 2 A) shows an arrangement of side chains, calcium coordination, and bound waters that was virtually identical to the structures of group IB and IIA sPLA2 structures without bound ligands (29Steiner R.A. Rozeboom H.J. de Vries A. Kalk K.H. Murshudov G.N. Wilson K.S. Dijkstra B.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 516-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 30Scott D.L. White S.P. Browning J.L. Rosa J.J. Gelb M.H. Sigler P.B. Science. 1991; 254: 1007-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Just as has been observed in the group IB and IIA structures, the catalytic Ca2+ has octahedral geometry with 7 coordinating oxygen ligands with Ca2+-oxygen distances that range from 2.3 to 2.6 Å. The Ca2+-binding loop was comprised of three carbonyl oxygens from Phe-26, Gly-28, and Gly-30. The two carboxylate oxygens of Asp-47 share an equatorial coordination site to Ca2+. The remaining positions were occupied by the axial water w12 and the equatorial water w5, often referred to as the catalytic water. The second sphere waters, w6 and w7, bridge the acid/base catalyst His-46 and the Ca2+ ligands w5 and Asp-47. The conservation of an hGX active site including active site residues and mechanistically critical waters suggests a conserved mechanism of this class of sPLA2 enzyme.Figure 2Active site and Ca2+ coordination in the hGX structure. A, ball andstick model of hGX from the P21 crystal form, which was grown without the inhibitor MJ33. The active site is shown including residues Asp-91, His-46, Asp-47, and the catalytic Ca2+. The first and second sphere waters of the Ca2+ are likewise shown. The Ca2+ coordination includes carbonyl backbone interactions from Phe-26, Gly-28, and Gly-30, waters w5 and w12, and finally a shared bidentate interaction from Asp-47. B, electron density difference map (coefficient 2F o − F c) drawn at a 1.0-ς cutoff of the active site of hGX crystal form C2221 grown in the presence of the inhibitor MJ33. The view shown is a top down view of A. The active site residues, Ca2+, and bound water molecules are nearly identically placed relative to that observed for the hGX P21 crystal form (A), which was grown without MJ33. All of the Ca2+-coordinated waters (first and second shell) are modeled into well defined electron density. Two molecules of the compound MPD were modeled into the active site. The figure was made using the programs MOLSCRIPT (50Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), POVSCRIPT (E. Peisach and D. Peisach), and POVRAY (www.povray.org).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)hGX Co-crystallized with MJ33 Yielded a Ligand-free StructureTwo crystal forms were obtained of hGX controlled by whether or not the inhibitor MJ33 was added. The crystal form grown in the absence of MJ33 was in the P21 space group and had 3 subunits of hGX in the asymmetric unit. The crystal form grown with MJ33 at a saturating concentration (3 mm) was in the space group C2221 with 2 subunits in the asymmetric unit. However, this crystal form also yielded a ligand-free crystal structure. The active site of the hGX structure from crystals that were grown in the presence of MJ33 is shown in Fig. 2 B. The electron density map (2F o − F c) unequivocally identifies this as a ligand-free structure. Careful examination of F o − F cdifference electron density maps confirmed the absence of a substrate-mimic ligand bound to the Ca2+. Difference density was located farther from the bound Ca2+, which led to the modeling of two molecules of MPD into the hGX active site (Fig.2 B). The position of these MPD molecules was very similar to the placement of MPD solvent molecules into the 0.97-Å crystal structure of bovine group IB sPLA2, which was likewise ligand free (29Steiner R.A. Rozeboom H.J. de Vries A. Kalk K.H. Murshudov G.N. Wilson K.S. Dijkstra B.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 516-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Comparison of hGX to Group IB and IIA sPLA2StructuresAs one would expect from the alignment of sPLA2 sequences (Fig. 1), the main chain Cα-trace of hGX resembles the group IIA structures more than the group IB pancreatic enzymes. An overlay of group X, IIA, and IB enzymes was shown in Fig. 3highlighting some minor, yet potentially significant differences. The group IB enzymes have an insertion of 5 residues (amino acids 62–66, Fig. 1) relative to the hGX and human group IIA (hGIIA) sequences. The overlay shown in Fig. 3 A demonstrates the result of this difference by a significantly altered surface loop (amino acids 59–75) for the porcine group IB enzyme (pGIB) shown at the top of the figure. Tyr-69 of group IB enzymes binds with the sn-3 phosphate moiety of the substrate mimics (32Scott D.L. Otwinowski Z. Gelb M.H. Sigler P.B. Science. 1990; 250: 1563-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 33Scott D.L. Sigler P.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 53-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Thunnissen M.M. Ab E. Kalk K.H.

The analogous position in the group X and IIA enzymes contains a lysine residue at this position, which likewise interacts with thesn-3 phosphate moiety of an inhibitor complex with the hGIIA enzyme (30Scott D.L. White S.P. Browning J.L. Rosa J.J. Gelb M.H. Sigler P.B. Science. 1991; 254: 1007-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). It was also significant that the differences of this i-face surface loop greatly affect the size and shape of the sPLA2 active site. The other notable difference was the C-terminal extension of group X and IIA structures relative to the group IB structures.Figure 3Comparison of hGX to other sPLA2 family members. A, Cα trace comparison of hGX subunit A (blue) with two sPLA2 structures: hGIIA with the tetrahedral transition state analog 1-O-octyl-2-heptylphosphonyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine bound (red, Protein Data Bank number 1POE (30Scott D.L.

The plane of the i-face-binding region of hGX is shown to the front of this view, with the active site pocket in the center of the structure. The position of the i-face surface loop from amino acids 59 to 75 of the pGIB structure is labeled as the 69-loop because of the importance of Tyr-69. B, comparison of hGX (blue) with the hGIIA sPLA2 (red) with the tetrahedral transition state analog 1-O-octyl-2-heptylphosphonyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine bound (Protein Data Bank number 1POE (30Scott D.L. White S.P. Browning J.L. Rosa J.J. Gelb M.H. Sigler P.B. Science. 1991; 254: 1007-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar)). The catalytic Ca2+ ions of the hGX and hGIIA structures are likewise shown in red and blue, respectively. The i-face of the sPLA2 structures is facing the bottom of the figure with the alkyl chain of the inhibitor pointing down. Also shown is the interfacial residue Trp-67 from the hGX structure (blue). The i-face surface loop from amino acids 14 to 20 of the hGX structure is labeled. The structures were aligned over their two long α-helices (amino acids 42–53, 86–99 in hGX; amino acids 43–54 and 86–99 in hGIIA; amino acids 44–55 and 94–107 in pGIB). The figure was made using the programs MOLSCRIPT (50Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), POVSCRIPT (E. Peisach and D. Peisach), and POVRAY (www.povray.org).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)More subtle differences exist between hGX and the group IIA Cα traces shown in Fig. 3 B. For example, the hGX structure has a slightly modified position of the surface loop from amino acid position 14 to 20 (14–20 loop) of the hGX sequence. This loop is labeled in the bottom of Fig. 3 B, and was likely critical for i-face binding. This loop begins with a proline residue at position 14, which varies in many of the other sPLA2 family members (Fig. 1). It is noteworthy that this proline exists in both a cis-proline andtrans-proline form in the hGX structures reported here. Remarkably, subunit A of the C2221 crystal form has acis-proline at position 14, whereas subunit B from the same structure has a trans-proline at the same position. In contrast, all three prolines at position 14 of the P21crystal form exist in the trans form. Pro-78 of the hGX structure was modeled as a cis-proline in 4 of the 5 independent views of the hGX structure; one of the subunits of the P21 crystal form had one of the Pro-78 residues modeled in the trans-conformation. In each case, thecis-prolines at positions 14 or 78 made crystal contacts with other subunits of the crystal structures. Likewise, thetrans-proline forms at positions 14 and 78 were observed when no such crystal contacts existed. Despite these subtle Cα trace differences, the group X and IIA enzymes show considerable homology. In the absence of an active site directed ligand bound to hGX, the structure of the hGIIA enzyme complexed with the inhibitor 1-O-octyl-2-heptylphosphonyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (Fig. 3, Protein Data Bank number 1POE) serves as a useful model to predict potential differences in substrate and inhibitor specificity (30Scott D.L. White S.P. Browning J.L. Rosa J.J. Gelb M.H. Sigler P.B. Science. 1991; 254: 1007-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Although Cα overlays demonstrate a very similar core structure, considerable differences exist on the i-face surface of these two enzymes, as well as the entrance of their active site pockets.Electrostatic Potential and van der Waals Surface of hGXThe critical functional features of sPLA2 are intricately controlled by how the enzyme interacts with its substrate interface. Experimental approaches have led to a prediction of not only which surface of the sPLA2 enzymes interact with the interface, but additionally the specific nature of these interactions (5Berg O.G.

An electrostatic potential and van der Waals surface comparison of the i-face of hGX versus hGIIA is displayed in Fig.4, which shows the most dramatic, and likely, the most significant differences between these two enzymes. The human synovial fluid group IIA enzyme displays an extensively positive charged i-face surface. In contrast the hGX i-face surface was mainly nonpolar in nature and therefore electrostatically neutral. Another striking difference can be observed (Fig. 4) from a comparison of the van der Waals surface of the active site opening of ligand-free structures of hGX versus hGIIA. The hGX active site was considerably more open, possibly indicating a functional need to accommodate substrates with polyunsaturated sn-2 chains, such as arachidonate. Among mammalian sPLA2s, hGX and mouse group X display the largest preference for phospholipid with ansn-2 arachidonyl chain versus a palmitoyl chain based on relative interfacialk cat/K mvalues. 2M. H. Gelb, unpublished data. For example, the hGIIA enzyme with a considerably narrower active site opening on the i-face (Fig. 4) is 3-fold less specific than hGX for an arachidonylversus palmitoyl chain at the sn-2 position.Figure 4Electrostatic surface potentials of hGX (A) and hGIIA (B) in a ligand-free form (Protein Data Bank number 1POD (30Scott D.L.

The view shown for each structure presents the i-face binding surface of the enzyme. The active sites shown in the center of each structure have noticeably different sizes and shapes. The sPLA2 model of each structure is displayed in stick format with CPK colors. The potential surface is displayed color-coded onto a meshed van der Waals surface using the program GRASP (51Honig B.

The apparent parameters for the kinetic characterization of hGX on the various forms of substrates are summarized in Table II. The hGX initial rate (v o) of hydrolysis at X S = 1 on dimyristoyl-sn-3-phosphomethanol vesicles was only 10 s−1 compared with 270 s−1 for the pGIB (36Berg O.G. Yu B.Z. Rogers J. Jain M.K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7283-7297Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and 90 s−1 for hGIIA (37Bayburt T. Yu B.Z. Lin H.K. Browning J. Jain M.K. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Although the reaction progress in the scooting mode was not observed with hGX on zwitterionic DMPC vesicles, a high affinity for the zwitterionic interface was indicated by the kinetic parameters (see below) underlying a comparatively high activity of 20 s−1 for hGX compared with initialv o values that were close to zero for the hydrolysis of DMPC vesicles by pGIB and hGIIA sPLA2s (38Apitz-Castro R.

In short, the most significant difference between the hGX relative to pGIB and hGIIA was in a dramatically higher ability of hGX to hydrolyze substrates at a zwitterionic interface.Table IIKinetic parameters for hGX sPLA2Substratev oV maxapp2-aThe apparent rate parameters were obtained by fitting the concentration dependence of the observed initial rate under the respective conditions (41).

https://openalex.org/W2076432198,"Rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG) is a trimeric and surface-exposed viral coat protein that has been shown to interact with the murine p75 neurotrophin receptor. We have investigated binding of RVG to p75 and describe several features that distinguish the p75-RVG interaction from conventional neurotrophin binding to p75. RVG binds mammalian but not avian p75 and does not bind to any of the Trk neurotrophin receptors. The mammalian p75 specificity of RVG binding may partly explain the phyletic specificity of rabies infection. Radioiodinated nerve growth factor (NGF) and RVG both bind to rat p75 but do not compete with each other's binding site. Although neurotrophins bind to the second and third cysteine-rich domains (CRD) of p75, RVG specifically interacts with high affinity (K d 30–35 pm) with the first CRD (CRD1). Substitution of Gln33 in p75-CRD1 by Glu completely abolishes RVG binding. Our data therefore firmly establish RVG as a trimeric high affinity ligand for a non-neurotrophin binding site on p75. Interestingly, the CRD1 in another TNF/NGF family receptor was recently shown to be involved in the binding of the herpes virus glycoprotein gD, suggesting that the CRD1 of TNF/NGF family members may be a widely used binding domain for viral glycoproteins.

Rupprecht C.E. Fu Z.F. Koprowski H. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 3rd. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 1137-1159Google Scholar). It is an enveloped virus with a single type I glycoprotein G (RVG) of 65 kDa inserted in its membrane. RVG is organized as a trimer and is responsible for the binding of the virus to the target cells and for the fusion between viral and cell membranes during the endocytosis of the virus. RV and other lyssaviruses are highly neurotropic and can cause fatal encephalomyelitis in mammals (2Charlton K.M. Rupprecht C.E. Dietzschold B. Koprowski H. Lyssaviruses. Spingler-Verlag Press, Berlin1994: 95-119Google Scholar). Infection of both wild type and laboratory strains of RV is mainly targeted to neurons in vivo. In contrast in vitro infections with laboratory strains can target a range of cell types, and only wild type RV still shows specific neurotropism under these conditions. Specific interactions between RVG and neuronal cell surface molecules have been demonstrated (3Tuffereau C. Bénéjean J. Flamand A. Fishman M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1085-1091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of specific neuronal receptor(s). An expression cloning approach using soluble RVG to screen a neuroblastoma cell library led us to the identification of the murine p75 neurotrophin receptor as a candidate RVG receptor (4Tuffereau C. Benejean J. Blondel D. Kieffer B. Flamand A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7250-7259Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Subsequent examination of six other lyssavirus genotypes revealed one additional viral glycoprotein (from European Bat lyssavirus 2) that can also bind p75 (5Tuffereau C. Desmezieres E. Benejean J. Jallet C. Flamand A. Tordo N. Perrin P. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 2861-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The p75 neurotrophin receptor is highly conserved in vertebrates, and its expression is developmentally regulated (6Chao M.V. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1373-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 7Hutson L.D. Bothwell M. J. Neurobiol. 2001; 49: 79-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). During embryogenesis, p75 is present in neuronal as well as in non-neuronal cells, but in the adult its expression is essentially restricted to the peripheral and the central nervous system (8Barker P.A. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). p75 contains four cysteine-rich domains (CRD) in the N-terminal ectodomain and a type II death domain in its cytoplasmic C-terminal segment (8Barker P.A. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), both features characteristic of the TNF receptor superfamily. However, in contrast to the trimeric organization of all TNF family ligands, the NGF family of neurotrophin ligands of p75 are dimers. Neurotrophins bind to p75 with nanomolar range affinities, and their binding site has been mapped to a region encompassing both CRD2 and CRD3 (9Yan H. Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12099-12104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Welcher A.A. Bitler C.M. Radeke M.J. Shooter E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The physiological role of this binding in neurons is still under debate, with reported effects ranging from enhancement of axonal outgrowth through modulation of cell survival or active cell death (12Lee F.S.

Neuron. 1999; 24: 585-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Some aspects of this discussion might be resolved by the recent discovery that pro-neurotrophins also bind to p75 with higher affinities than the mature domain alone (18Lee R. Kermani P. Teng K.K. Hempstead B.L. Science. 2001; 294: 1945-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar, 19Chao M.V. Bothwell M.

In addition, a number of other molecules with no sequence homology to neurotrophins have been reported to bind p75, including cysteine-rich neurotrophic factor (CRNF) from the molluskLymnaea (21Fainzilber M. Smit A.B. Syed N.I. Wildering W.C. Hermann P. van der Schors R.C. Jimenez C., Li, K.W. van Minnen J. Bulloch A.G. Ibanez C.F. Geraerts W.P.

Interaction domains have not been mapped for any of these non-neurotrophin ligands, and their physiological significance is unknown. Although cells expressing p75 become susceptible to infection by a wild type RV isolate, the role of p75 in natural RV infection is still a matter of debate. The p75exonIII−/− mice established by Lee et al. (26Lee K.F., Li, H. Huber L.J. Landis S.C. Sharpe A.H. Chao M.V. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 737-749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar) are susceptible to RV infection (27Jackson A.C. Park H. Acta Neuropathol (Berl). 1999; 98: 641-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The significance of this finding is debatable because it was recently reported that these mice retain expression of a novel splice variant of p75 consisting of CRD1 linked to the transmembrane and intracellular domains (28von Schack D. Casademunt E. Schweigreiter R. Meyer M. Bibel M. Dechant G. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 977-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, a number of studies have proposed other candidate neuronal RV receptors, including the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (29Lentz T.L. Wilson P.T. Hawrot E. Speicher D.W. Science. 1984; 226: 847-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) (30Thoulouze M.I. Lafage M. Schachner M. Hartmann U. Cremer H. Lafon M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7181-7190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have analyzed structural determinants of p75 binding of RVG with the hope of shedding light on the role of p75 in rabies infectivity and with the goal of determining the potential of RVG as a novel pharmacological probe of p75. Our results establish that RVG is a high affinity ligand of the first CRD of p75, and as such provides a natural trimeric ligand for a non-neurotrophin binding site on the receptor. Cos 7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) plus 10% fetal bovine serum. SK-N-BE and SK-p75 cells, kindly provided by G. Della Valle (University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy), were grown in DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum (31Bunone G. Mariotti A. Compagni A. Morandi E. Della Valle G. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1463-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). PC12 and BHK-21-BSR cells were grown in minimum essential medium (MEM) (Invitrogen) plus 10% calf serum. BSR cells were used to produce RV and VSV (vesicular stomatitis virus) as described previously (32Gaudin Y. Ruigrok R.W. Tuffereau C. Knossow M. Flamand A. Virology. 1992; 187: 627-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Viral glycoproteins from RV and VSV were purified using slight modifications of a previously described protocol (32Gaudin Y. Ruigrok R.W. Tuffereau C. Knossow M. Flamand A. Virology. 1992; 187: 627-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified viruses were treated with 1% CHAPS in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (2 μg each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipapain, and pepstatin per ml and 16 μg of aprotinin per ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. Solubilized virions were overlaid on the top of a 20% sucrose cushion in PBS buffer containing 1% CHAPS and centrifuged for 1 h (SW41, 35,000 rpm, 4 °C). Supernatants containing mainly glycoproteins were concentrated on a Centricon 30 (Amicon) then loaded on a 5–20% sucrose gradient in 10 mm NaCl, 10 mmTris, pH 8, buffer containing 1% CHAPS and centrifuged for 16 h at 35000 rpm in a SW41 rotor (Beckman). Fractions containing trimeric glycoprotein corresponding to a 9 S sedimentation coefficient were pooled and loaded onto a DEAE-Trisacryl column (IBF, Biotechnics) in NaCl 10 mm, Tris 10 mm, pH 8, plus 1% CHAPS. Glycoproteins were eluted by 250 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, plus 1% CHAPS. Extensive dialysis against PBS was performed to remove the detergent, and the protein concentration was determined by Bradford quantification. The final protein preparations consisted of pure rosettes of RVG or VSVG, averaging 10 trimers per rosette and at concentrations ranging from 0. 8 to 1 mg/ml. A rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the intracellular domain of p75 (Promega) was used for Western blot detection. For immunofluorescence staining, p75 was detected with either the REX polyclonal antibody, kindly provided by Louis Reichardt (University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, CA) or with the mouse monoclonal ME20.4 (ATCC). Trk receptors were detected with a rabbit polyclonal pan-Trk antibody (PC-31, Oncogene Research Products). Human and chicken p75 plasmids were kindly provided by B. Hempsteadt (Cornell University, NY) and G. Dechant (Max Planck Institute, Munich), respectively. Plasmids encoding human TrkA, murine TrkB, or swine TrkC receptors kinase were kindly donated by M. Barbacid (Centro Nacional de Investigaciones, Madrid). The p75 and the Trk coding sequences were sub-cloned into pcDNA1 vector (Invitrogen). CRD deletion mutants were obtained by a recombinant PCR technique using a human p75 cDNA cloned in pcDNA1 as a template and specific primers to introduce CRD deletions within the extracellular domain of the receptor. Briefly, the CRD1, CRD1–2, and CRD1–3 mutants were constructed by PCR amplifying the N-terminal encoding segment (from the ATG to the corresponding 3′CRD) with the following primers: upper primer RA1 (GCGGGATCCCGGGCGATGGGGGCAG) versus lower primers GCCAGGGATCTCCTCACACACGGTCTGGTT (for CRD1), GCCAGGGATCTCCTCGCACACGGCGTCGTC (for CRD1–2), or GCCAGGGATCTCCTCGCACACGGTGTTCTG (for CRD1–3). These PCR products were then annealed to the end-overlapping C-terminal encoding segment (transmembrane and intracellular domains) constructed by PCR with lower primer RB5 (CGCGGATCCTCATCACACCGGGGATGTGGC) versusupper primers AACCAGACCGTGTGTGAGGAGATCCCTGGC (for CRD1), GACGACGCCGTGTGCGAGGAGATCCCTGGC (for CRD1–2), or CAGAACACCGTGTGCGAGGAGATCCCTGGC (for CRD1–3). The annealed full construct was then PCR amplified with primers RA1 and RB5, digested, and subcloned. For the CRD2–4 mutant a slightly modified strategy was used, namely amplification of the whole construct from the N-terminal of CRD2 to the stop codon, using RB5 as a lower primerversus a specific upper primer (TCCCTTGGAGGTGCCTGCCTGGACAGCGTG). This product was then annealed to a short segment encoding the ATG and signal sequence segment made with RA1 as upper primer versus a specific lower primer (CACGCTGTCCAGGCAGGCACCTCCAAGGGA). The full construct was then amplified with primers RA1 versus RB5. All constructs were subcloned into pCDNA1 and sequence-verified on both strands. Point mutations in the CRD1 mutant were introduced using the QuikChangeTM Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). The mutations were introduced in the gene by amplification using PfuTurboTM DNA polymerase and two synthetic oligonucleotide primers bearing the desired mutation. Incorporation of the oligonucleotide primers generates a mutated plasmid containing staggered nicks. After the amplification process, the parental DNA template (methylated or hemi-methylated) was digested for 1 h at 37° by the DpnI endonuclease C, and the digestion product was used to transform MC1061 bacteria. Recombinant plasmids were then sequenced. Cos 7 cells were transiently transfected with the pcDNA1 derived plasmids using the DEAE-dextran method as described previously (4Tuffereau C. Benejean J. Blondel D. Kieffer B. Flamand A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7250-7259Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Transfected Cos 7 cells were washed with PBS 48 h post-transfection and incubated with REX antibody (1/1000) for 2 h at room temperature. After three washes, cells were fixed with cold paraformaldehyde 4% in PBS for 15 min and washed twice before incubation with a goat anti-rabbit rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at 1/100 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. For Trk expression, rabbit anti-pan Trk antibody was diluted (1:100) in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and applied on paraformaldehyde-fixed cells. Transiently transfected Cos 7 cells were analyzed for protein expression. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, they were lysed in a Tris buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 0.7 mm Na2HPO4, 5 mm KCl)-CHAPS 1% buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture for 30 min on ice. After clarification by centrifugation, an aliquot of the cell extract was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the mutated p75 proteins were detected by Western blot using an antibody to the p75 cytoplasmic domain (Promega). Cell surface proteins from transiently transfected cells were labeled with EZ-LinkTM Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) at 1 mg/ml in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed three times prior to lysis by 1% CHAPS. Cell lysates were centrifuged, and biotin-labeled proteins were precipitated using agarose streptavidin beads (Pierce) and then separated by SDS-PAGE. Biotinylated p75 molecules were detected on Western blot using the Promega anti-cytoplasmic domain antibody. Proteins were separated on a polyacrylamide SDS gel in Tris-glycine-SDS buffer and transferred by electrophoresis onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL, AmershamBiosciences). The membranes were blocked for 1 h in TBS buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 2.5% (w/v) dried nonfat milk, and then incubated with 1/3000 dilution of the primary antibody in TBS buffer containing 0.5% milk. After washes in TBS buffer, the membrane was incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Sigma) (1/3000). The membrane was then washed three times and proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (AmershamBiosciences). Transfected Cos 7 cells were treated with 10 μg of purified RVG in 1.5 ml of DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were washed three times and fixed by 4% cold paraformaldehyde. Cells were then incubated with specific anti-RVG monoclonal antibodies and then with a β-galactosidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Southern Biotechnology Associates), using X-Gal substrate as previously described (4Tuffereau C. Benejean J. Blondel D. Kieffer B. Flamand A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7250-7259Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Cos 7 cells were tranfected with the hp75 plasmid, and 40 h post-transfection RVG (10 μg/ml) was added for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were rapidly washed and then incubated with 2 mm DTSSP (3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate)) (Pierce) in phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, for 30 min on ice. The reaction was stopped by addition of 20 mm Tris, pH 8, for 15 min, and the cells were then washed with phosphate buffer before lysis in ice cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris, pH 7.4, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 1% Nonidet P-40) containing 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide and a protease inhibitor mixture. Lysates were cleared by quick centrifugation, mixed with PAGE loading buffer with or without reducing agents, and resolved on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel run in cold buffer at low voltage. After blotting, the nitrocellulose membrane was probed with anti-p75 monoclonal antibody (ME20.4) or polyclonal anti-cytoplasmic antibody (Promega). Iodination was done by the lactoperoxidase method to an average specific activity of 7.5 × 107cpm/μg. Iodinated RVG was purified by size-exclusion chromatography through a Sephadex G25 column. For steady-state competitive binding assays, cells were suspended in Eppendorf tubes with 20 ng/ml 125I-RVG (∼30 pm, assuming one available binding trimer per rosette) in PBS supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.5 mm CaCl2, in the presence or absence of cold competitors. Binding was allowed to occur with gentle rocking at 4 °C for at least 2 h, and the bound ligand was separated from free ligand by rapid pelleting of the cells in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at 4 °C. Background binding was determined using a 400-fold excess of unlabeled RVG. A structural model for human p75 was built with the program Modeler (33Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10292) Google Scholar) using a high resolution extracellular domain structure of TNFR (PDB code 1ext) (34Naismith J.H. Devine T.Q. Brandhuber B.J.

We first investigated if RVG interacts with p75 from different species (human, mouse, and chicken). Cos 7 cells were transiently transfected, and the cell surface expression of p75 was verified by indirect immunofluorescence (Fig.1 A). In all cases, p75 was detected at the cell surface; however, the intensity of the fluorescence was weaker in the case of chicken p75 (cp75) than in the case of human (hp75) or mouse (mp75). Binding of RVG to the different p75 species was assessed by immunostaining of RVG-challenged cells with an anti-RVG monoclonal, followed by a β-galactosidase-coupled secondary antibody. This protocol was previously shown to be specific (4Tuffereau C. Benejean J. Blondel D. Kieffer B. Flamand A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7250-7259Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), and no blue staining was observed when RVG or anti-RVG monoclonal antibodies were omitted. Only cells expressing human or mouse p75 had a blue appearance (Fig. 1), whereas RVG binding could not be detected on cells expressing chicken p75. We then investigated if RVG was also able to bind to the high affinity tyrosine kinase receptors for neurotrophins (TrkA, TrkB, or TrkC). Trk expression in transiently transfected Cos 7 cells was confirmed with a pan-Trk antibody, and RVG binding was then measured as described above. As shown in Fig. 1, although all three Trk receptors were expressed, no RVG binding was observed. In addition no RVG binding could be observed on stable cell lines expressing murine TrkB or TrkC (data not shown). Our next step was to quantify the affinity of RVG binding to p75 in PC12 cells. RVG was iodinated to a specific activity of 7.5 × 104 cpm/ng by the lactoperoxidase method, and its binding to PC12 cells was measured on its own or in the presence of excess cold RVG, NGF, or VSVG. Parallel experiments were performed with iodinated NGF for comparison. Both ligands bound to PC12 cells with good ratios of total to nonspecific binding (Fig.2 A), and the control VSVG protein did not displace either ligand. Interestingly, excess cold NGF could not compete with 125I-RVG binding, nor could excess cold RVG displace 125I-NGF. Similar results were obtained with PC12-nnr5 cells, which express p75 but not Trk (data not shown), suggesting that the RVG binding observed in PC12 is to the p75 receptor. RVG binding on PC12 cells was found to be a high affinity interaction, with a K d of 35 ± 5 pm (Fig. 2 B), assuming one binding trimer per rosette of RVG. We then investigated the oligomerization state of p75 in the presence or absence of RVG because it was recently suggested that p75 might form trimers in the absence of ligand (23Yaar M. Zhai S. Fine R.E. Eisenhauer P.B. Arble B.L. Stewart K.B. Gilchrest B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7720-7725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In p75-overexpressing cells, both monomeric and oligomeric forms of the receptor were observed, with the latter migrating as apparent trimers (Fig. 3 A). The putative trimer was present in all extraction conditions used and in transiently transfected Cos 7 cells its proportion increased with time (data not shown). After cross-linking an additional band migrating as an apparent dimer was detected in non-reducing conditions (Fig.3 B) and was absent in reducing conditions while some of the apparent trimers were still observed (Fig. 3 C). Upon cross-linking after incubation with RVG, all three p75 bands were diminished, and an additional high molecular weight complex that does not enter the gel was observed (Fig. 3 B). This unresolved complex is consistent with the high molecular mass of the RVG rosette, thus unfortunately not allowing definitive identification of a preferred oligomeric species of p75 for RVG binding. To map the binding site for RVG on p75, we constructed different deletion mutants of the CRDs in human p75 (hp75). To maintain correct folding and processing of the mutants, the integrity of each individual CRD was preserved. The deletion mutants contained one, two, or three CRDs connected via theO-glycosylated linker to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of hp75 (Fig. 4 A). Cos 7 cells were transfected with the different plasmids, and expression of the mutants was analyzed by Western blot with an anti-cytoplasmic p75 antibody (Fig. 4 B). The different deletion mutants migrated on SDS-PAGE according to their predicted molecular mass. In the case of the CRD1-only mutant, the protein migrated as a doublet. Cell surface expression of all the mutants was confirmed by immunofluorescence, albeit at varying levels (Fig. 4 C). RVG bound to all the mutants tested, except that in which CRD1 was deleted (Fig.4 D). Conversely, CRD1 alone was sufficient for RVG binding. Thus, although neurotrophin binding maps to CRD2 + CRD3 on p75 (9Yan H. Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12099-12104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Welcher A.A. Bitler C.M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 4594-4602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), RVG binding is clearly localized to CRD1. To further map RVG binding on p75, a structural homology model of p75 (Fig. 5 A) was built based on the TNFR-I x-ray structure (36Naismith J.H. Devine T.Q. Kohno T. Sprang S.R. Structure. 1996; 4: 1251-1262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The extracellular domains of the two molecules share a sequence identity of only 25% over 152 residues. However, the conservation of more than 20 cysteines in the TNFR family, and the use of a position-specific alignment algorithm (35Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Shaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58760) Google Scholar) allowed a reliable alignment, which is a prerequisite for accurate homology modeling (33Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10292) Google Scholar). Although the relative orientations of the CRDs are likely to be different in p75 and TNFR-I, the overall structure of each CRD can be assessed with confidence. Previous modeling studies of p75NTR (37Chapman B.S. Kuntz I.D. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1696-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 38Shamovsky I.L. Ross G.M. Riopelle R.J. Weaver D.F. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2223-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have focused on CRD2, CRD3, and CRD4, being concerned with the possible interactions with neurotrophins. A closer view of CRD1 is presented here (Fig. 5 B), showing that several polar or charged residues (Glu14, Lys17, theN-glycosylation site Asn32, and Gln33) cluster on the same side of the molecule near Ala31, a residue that is a valine in chicken p75 (Fig.5 C). Point mutations were introduced at those positions and at those differing between chicken and human p75 (Ala3, Gly7, Ala26, Ala31, and Ala26 + Ala31). The sequences of the different mutants were confirmed, and their expression was verified by cell surface biotinylation as well as Western blot analysis using an anti-cytoplasmic p75 antibody (Fig.6 A). Two bands were detected, the major one represents the mature protein migrating around 46 kDa, and the minor one (noted by an asterisk) represents the immature form of the protein. The different mutant proteins were all expressed at the cell surface (Fig. 6 A), albeit at somewhat lower levels for the mutants A3K, G7K, and A31V. For the N32Q mutant, good cell surface expression was demonstrated by efficient surface biotinylation, despite the lack of N-linked glycosylation. Cell surface expression of the mutants was also confirmed by immunofluorescence as shown for four examples (E14Q, K17Q, N32Q, and Q33E) in Fig. 6 B. RVG binding was assessed by the β-galactosidase method on cells expressing CRD1 mutants"

Our prior investigations showed that long GAA·TTC repeats formed very stable triplex structures which caused two repeat tracts to adhere to each other (sticky DNA). This process was dependent on negative supercoiling and the presence of divalent metal ions. Herein, we have investigated the formation of sticky DNA from plasmid monomers and dimers; sticky DNA is formed only when two tracts of sufficiently long (GAA·TTC)n (n = 59–270) are present in a single plasmid DNA and are in the direct repeat orientation. If the inserts are in the indirect (inverted) repeat orientation, no sticky DNA was observed. Furthermore, kinetic studies support the intramolecular nature of sticky DNA formation. Electron microscopy investigations also provide strong data for sticky DNA as a single long triplex. Hence, these results give new insights into our understanding of the capacity of sticky DNA to inhibit transcription and thereby reduce the level of frataxin protein as related to the etiology of Friedreich's ataxia.

The FRDA gene, X25, contains seven exons and encodes a 210-amino acid protein called frataxin (8Campuzano V. Montermini L. Molto M.D. Pianese L. Cossee M. Cavalcanti F. Monros E. Rodius F. Duclos F.

The vast majority of FRDA patients have an expanded GAA·TTC repeat in the first intron of the frataxin gene.

FRDA is the only triplet repeat disease that has a recessive inheritance pattern and is caused by the expansion of a GAA·TTC repeat (9).

Patients carrying expanded GAA·TTC repeats in both alleles have reduced levels of frataxin, and an inverse correlation exists between the size of the GAA·TTC repeat and amount of the frataxin protein (13Durr A.

Sticky DNA was stabilized by negative supercoiling as well as divalent metal ions and was characterized as an X-shaped structure in the linearized plasmid molecules. The crossover points of the X-shaped molecules were rigorously shown to occur at the TRS. We hypothesized (20Sakamoto N. Chastain P.D. Parniewski P. Ohshima K. Pandolfo M. Griffith J.D. Wells R.D.

Here we have conducted a further evaluation of the molecular nature of sticky DNA. These results led us to conclude that sticky DNA is only formed intramolecularly from two tracts of GAA·TTC in a single molecule and exists as a single long R·R·Y triplex. Thus, the previous hypothesis of a strand-exchanged bitriplex model (20Sakamoto N. Chastain P.D. Parniewski P. Ohshima K. Pandolfo M. Griffith J.D. Wells R.D. Mol.

No statistical differences in the length distributions were found if the composite data for all enzymes were plotted versus the data for each of the separate enzymes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Supercoiled plasmids were purified either by the large scale plasmid isolation method followed by equilibrium centrifugation in a CsCl/ethidium bromide (EtBr) gradient (36Sambrook J. Russell D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) or by the Promega Wizard Plus Minipreps DNA Purification procedure (Promega Corp.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Large scale plasmid isolations were performed from 1 liter of overnight cultures of theEscherichia coli SURE strain. E. coli were transformed using the CaCl2 transformation method (36Sambrook J. Russell D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) and grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. After DNA isolation by alkali lysis, plasmids were purified by equilibrium CsCl/EtBr gradient ultracentrifugation overnight. The ultracentrifugation was followed by exhaustive dialysis against three changes of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA (TE) buffer. To purify DNA monomers and dimers, 1–10 μg of the isolated plasmids, which contained monomers, dimers, and higher oligomers in 60 μl of TE buffer containing 10% sucrose and 0.01% bromphenol blue (loading buffer), was loaded onto a 1% agarose gel. Electrophoresis was conducted in 40 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.3), 1 mmEDTA (TAE) buffer at 5 V/cm until the bromphenol blue reached a distance of 6 cm. Gels were stained by EtBr as described elsewhere (36Sambrook J. Russell D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). To prevent DNA damage during UV irradiation, aluminum foil was placed under the gel as a screen while excising the band. The bands corresponding to the monomeric and dimeric isoforms of the plasmids were excised from the agarose gels. DNAs were eluted from the gels using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. To obtain analytical amounts of the monomeric and dimeric plasmid isoforms, we transformed E. coli HB101 with monomers and dimers. Individual colonies were inoculated into 10 ml of LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. After overnight growth, DNAs were isolated by the Promega Wizard Plus Minipreps DNA Purification procedure and analyzed on 1% agarose gels. When transformations were performed with the purified monomers, electrophoretic analyses of the isolated DNAs revealed that monomers represented more than 90% of the total DNA on a molar basis. When transformations were performed with purified dimers, no monomers were observed. A fragment containing the (GAA·TTC)60 tract was prepared from pRW3804 (18Ohshima K. Montermini L. Wells R.D.

Chem. 1998; 273: 14588-14595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) by BssHII andHaeIII digestion (New England Biolabs, Inc.) followed by filling in the recessed BssHII 3′ terminus with 0.1 unit of the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and dCTP plus dGTP (0.1 mm each). The sequence of the insert is GAGGA(GAA)50GAAAAAGAAAA(GAA)10, which is named (GAA· TTC)60 for simplicity. The repeating GAA·TTC tract is flanked by 34 bp and 54 bp of the human FRDA gene (8Campuzano V. Montermini L. Molto M.D. Pianese L. Cossee M. Cavalcanti F. Monros E. Rodius F. Duclos F. Monticelli A.

Pandolfo M. Science. 1996; 271: 1423-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (2254) Google Scholar). This blunt ended DNA fragment was used for the cloning of all four plasmids containing the TRS tracts in both orientations relative to the unidirectional ColE1 origin of replication shown in Fig. 4. The digested DNA was electrophoresed in a 7% polyacrylamide gel, stained with EtBr, and the band containing the triplet repeat fragment was excised. The DNA was eluted from the excised band, purified by phenol-chloroform extraction, and precipitated with ethanol (36Sambrook J. Russell D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). The vector was prepared by digesting pBR322 with EcoRI andHindIII followed by filling in the recessed 3′ termini. The ligation and all subsequent cloning steps were performed as described earlier (37Napierala M. Parniewski P. Pluciennik A. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34087-34100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). All plasmids were fully characterized by restriction mapping (to determine the orientation and length of the cloned TRS) and dideoxy sequencing of both strands with Thermo Sequenase Radiolabeled Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). This strategy enabled the construction of a set of plasmids (pRW4882–pRW4885) harboring two homologous (GAA·TTC)60tracts oriented as direct repeats or inverted repeats (see Fig. 4). The presence of sticky DNA in a DNA preparation is determined routinely by the detection of a substantially retarded band (RB) on agarose gel electrophoresis after plasmid linearization. Detection of RB formation was performed as described (20Sakamoto N. Chastain P.D. Parniewski P. Ohshima K. Pandolfo M. Griffith J.D. Wells R.D. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 465-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cleavage of plasmid DNAs by appropriate restriction enzymes was conducted in NEBuffer 1 (New England Biolabs, Inc.) (10 mm bis-Tris propane HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol (pH 7.0 at 25 °C)) supplemented with 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin if recommended by the manufacturer. Five units of the restriction enzyme/0.5 μg of DNA was used in a total reaction volume of 12 μl. Incubation times at 37 °C were 200 min or overnight; no differences were detected. Chilling to room temperature and addition of the loading buffer, as described above, stopped the reactions. To identify RB, we incubated the DNA for 10 min at 80 °C in 50 mm EDTA as described (20Sakamoto N. Chastain P.D. Parniewski P. Ohshima K. Pandolfo M. Griffith J.D. Wells R.D. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 465-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). RB is converted completely to the linear monomeric form after this treatment. Thus, the heat sensitivity of RB in the absence of divalent metal ions allows us to distinguish between RB and other possible structures. In some cases, the DNAs were 32P labeled using the E. coli DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment end labeling procedure (36Sambrook J. Russell D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) before loading onto the gel. Electrophoretic separations were conducted in 0.7% agarose gel for pSPL3 derivatives and 1% gel for pBR322 derivatives in TAE buffer at 5 V/cm with a distance of bromphenol blue migration of at least 6 cm. Staining of the gels by EtBr was performed as described elsewhere (36Sambrook J. Russell D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). For the electrophoresis of end-labeled samples, the agarose gels were dried at 65 °C overnight and exposed to Hyperfilm MP (AmershamBiosciences). To quantitate the EtBr-stained gels as well as the autoradiographs, we usually used the Gel Doc 2000 system from Quantity One software (Bio-Rad) for Windows 98. The standard error for RB formation (see Tables I and II) is ±10%.Table IIndependence of yield of RB on pRW3822 concentrationpRW3822 concentrationYield of RBμg/ml%21014.05013.52012.71012.31.811.50.711.0To determine the influence of the (GAA·TTC)150 concentration on the yield of RB after EcoRI cleavage, we performed the cleavage step after serial dilution of pRW3822 DNA. To avoid star activity, EcoRI underwent the same procedure of serial dilution. Then the corresponding solutions were mixed together. All other conditions of EcoRI cleavage were as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The maximum dilution of pRW3822 was 300-fold.

Cleavage byEcoRI (see “Experimental Procedures”) was conducted for the set of plasmid dimers under the same conditions. Yields of RB (in percent) were compared with the amount observed from purified dimers of pRW3822 under the same conditions.

Two types of determinations were conducted to evaluate whether the biological dimers were two monomer units oriented in the head-to-tail (or tail-to-head) orientation versus two interlocked circles or catenanes. First, E. coli HB101 was transformed by the CaCl2 method with gel-purified dimers of pRW3822. Ten individual colonies were inoculated into 10 ml of LB medium containing 100 μl/ml ampicillin.

https://openalex.org/W2065569894,"AKAP350 can scaffold a number of protein kinases and phosphatases at the centrosome and the Golgi apparatus. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a rabbit parietal cell library with a 3.2-kb segment of AKAP350 (nucleotides 3611–6813). This screen yielded a full-length clone of rabbit chloride intracellular channel 1 (CLIC1). CLIC1 belongs to a family of proteins, all of which contain a high degree of homology in their carboxyl termini. All CLIC family members were able to bind a 133-amino acid domain within AKAP350 through the last 120 amino acids in the conserved CLIC carboxyl termini. Antibodies developed against a bovine CLIC, p64, immunoprecipitated AKAP350 from HCA-7 colonic adenocarcinoma cell extracts. Antibodies against CLIC proteins recognized at least five CLIC species including a novel 46-kDa CLIC protein. We isolated the human homologue of bovine p64, CLIC5B, from HCA-7 cell cDNA. A splice variant of CLIC5, the predicted molecular mass of CLIC5B corresponds to the molecular mass of the 46-kDa CLIC immunoreactive protein in HCA-7 cells. Antibodies against CLIC5B colocalized with AKAP350 at the Golgi apparatus with minor staining of the centrosomes. AKAP350 and CLIC5B association with Golgi elements was lost following brefeldin A treatment. Furthermore, GFP-CLIC5B-(178–410) targeted to the Golgi apparatus in HCA-7 cells. The results suggest that AKAP350 associates with CLIC proteins and specifically that CLIC5B interacts with AKAP350 at the Golgi apparatus in HCA-7 cells.

Cells contain a dynamic organization of signaling molecules and proteins required for the transduction of intracellular signaling events. Thus, cellular organization is crucial for intracellular signals to function correctly. The study of how the cell completes this task has revealed molecular scaffolds that allow spatial control of signaling events (1Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Cell. 1996; 85: 9-12Google Scholar, 2Burack W.R. Shaw A.S. Cur. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 211-216Google Scholar). The study of signaling molecules scaffolded in specific locations within the cell has led to an expanded understanding of the cellular functions that they control. Scaffolding proteins are utilized in the cell to localize signaling proteins to specific areas facilitating precise cellular function. Protein kinase A-anchoring proteins (AKAPs) 1The abbreviations used are: AKAP, protein kinase A-anchoring protein; CLIC, chloride intracellular channel; PHR, pericentrin homology region; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBS, Tris-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: AKAP, protein kinase A-anchoring protein; CLIC, chloride intracellular channel; PHR, pericentrin homology region; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBS, Tris-buffered saline. are one class of scaffolding protein utilized by the cell to anchor the regulatory subunit of type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (3Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D.C. Bishop S.M. Acott T.S Brennan R.G. Scott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14188-14192Google Scholar) to specific locations within the cell (4Lester L.B. Scott J.D. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 409-430Google Scholar). In addition to the targeting of anchored protein kinase A, another key function of AKAPs is the recruitment of other signaling proteins (5Dodge K. Scott J.D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 58-61Google Scholar). Often an AKAP will scaffold both kinases and phosphatases, thereby coordinating specific signaling events (6Scott J.D. Edwards A.S. Cur. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 217-221Google Scholar). Thus, protein scaffolds can assemble protein kinase and phosphatase systems in close proximity of their intended substrates. We have previously defined one AKAP, AKAP350, which is the product of a multiply spliced gene family and is localized at the centrosome (7Schmidt P.H. Dransfield D.T. Claudio J.O. Hawley R.G. Trotter K.W. Milgram S.L. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3055-3066Google Scholar). This protein has also been observed on the Golgi apparatus, where it was identified as the centrosome and Golgi apparatus-localized protein kinase N-associated protein (CG-NAP) (8Takahashi M. Shibata H. Shimakawa M. Miyamoto M. Mukai H. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17267-17274Google Scholar). The sequence of CG-NAP is identical to AKAP450 designated according to its 450-kDa size (9Witczak O. Skalhegg B.S. Keryer G. Bornens M. Tasken K. Jahnsen T. Orstavik S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1858-1868Google Scholar), but we will refer to AKAP350/CG-NAP/AKAP450 as AKAP350 based on the original identification of this protein by Keryer et al. (10Keryer G. Rios R.M. Landmark B.F. Skalhegg B. Lahmann S.M. Bornens M. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 204: 230-240Google Scholar) as a 350-kDa protein kinase A-anchoring protein at the centrosome. The function of a particular AKAP is defined by its localization and the proteins bound to the scaffold (10Keryer G. Rios R.M. Landmark B.F. Skalhegg B. Lahmann S.M. Bornens M. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 204: 230-240Google Scholar). AKAP350 has putative binding sites for protein phosphatase 1, protein kinase N, protein phosphatase 2A (8Takahashi M. Shibata H. Shimakawa M. Miyamoto M. Mukai H. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17267-17274Google Scholar), protein kinase Cε (11Takahashi M. Mukai H. Oishi K. Isagawa T. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34592-34596Google Scholar), and phosphodiesterase 4D3 (12Tasken K.A Collas P. Kemmner W.A. Witczak O. Conti M. Tasken K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21999-22002Google Scholar) as well as two protein kinase A binding sites (7Schmidt P.H. Dransfield D.T. Claudio J.O. Hawley R.G. Trotter K.W. Milgram S.L. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3055-3066Google Scholar, 8Takahashi M. Shibata H. Shimakawa M. Miyamoto M. Mukai H. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17267-17274Google Scholar). However, previous studies have not identified proteins other than kinases and phosphatases interacting with AKAP350. We hypothesized that AKAP350 also bound to other signaling proteins based on the large size of the protein. Using yeast two-hybrid screening we now show that the chloride intracellular channel (CLIC) family of proteins interacts with a region of AKAP350 previously denoted as the pericentrin homology region (PHR) because of its 41% similarity with the centrosomal protein pericentrin (7Schmidt P.H. Dransfield D.T. Claudio J.O. Hawley R.G. Trotter K.W. Milgram S.L. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3055-3066Google Scholar). In addition, we identify a novel human CLIC family member, designated CLIC5B, which represents the human homologue of bovine p64 (13Landry D. Sullivan S. Nicolaides M. Redhead C. Edelman A. Field M., Al- Awqati Q. Edwards J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14948-14955Google Scholar). CLIC5B shares all but its first exon with the previously published human CLIC5 protein (14Berryman M. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1509-1521Google Scholar), renamed here as CLIC5A. CLIC5B immunostaining colocalized with AKAP350 at the Golgi apparatus as well as, to a lesser extent, the centrosome. The results suggest that AKAP350 may scaffold CLIC proteins at discrete sites within the cell. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Medical College of Georgia Molecular Biology Core Facility. Cy3-conjugated species-specific secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Prolong Antifade and Alexa 488-conjugated species-specific secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). [α-32P]dCTP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. A rabbit parietal cell two-hybrid library in pAD-GAL4 (15Lapierre L.A. Tuma P.L. Navarre J. Goldenring J.R. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3723-3732Google Scholar) was screened with 3.2 kb of AKAP350 sequence (nucleotides 3611–6813, GenBankTMaccession number AF083037) cloned into the binding domain vector pBDGal-4-Cam (Stratagene) with the use of EcoRI andSalI sites. The Y190 yeast strain harboring theHIS3 and β-galactosidase reporter genes were used to screen ∼1 million clones as described previously (15Lapierre L.A. Tuma P.L. Navarre J. Goldenring J.R. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3723-3732Google Scholar). The isolated clone was rescued into XL-1 Blue bacteria, and plasmid DNA was prepared using Qiagen Miniprep kits. All DNA sequencing was performed using dye terminator chemistry automated sequencing in the Molecular Biology Core Facility at the Medical College of Georgia. The isolated clone and the “bait” pBDGal-4-Cam vector both gave negative results when analyzed by themselves in yeast two-hybrid assays. Deletion constructs of the CLIC5B and the PHR region of AKAP350 (nucleotides 3611–6813) were cloned into pADGal-4 and pBDGal-4-Cam, respectively, usingEcoRI and SalI sites and were tested for interaction in the yeast-two hybrid assay as described previously (15Lapierre L.A. Tuma P.L. Navarre J. Goldenring J.R. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3723-3732Google Scholar). Full-length human CLIC1, CLIC4, CLIC5A, and parchorin constructs (14Berryman M. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1509-1521Google Scholar,16Nishizawa T. Nagao T. Iwatsubo T. Forte J.G. Urushidani T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11164-11173Google Scholar) were cloned into pADGal-4 and tested for interaction with the AKAP350-PHR-pBDGal-4-Cam bait in the yeast two hybrid assay as described previously (15Lapierre L.A. Tuma P.L. Navarre J. Goldenring J.R. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3723-3732Google Scholar). Positive results were recorded if β-galactosidase assay was positive within 3 h. The pADGal-4 vectors produced negative results when analyzed by alone. The 14G2 monoclonal anti-AKAP350 antibody was developed as described previously (7Schmidt P.H. Dransfield D.T. Claudio J.O. Hawley R.G. Trotter K.W. Milgram S.L. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3055-3066Google Scholar). The 121, 656, and B132 polyclonal anti-CLIC antibodies were prepared as described previously (14Berryman M. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1509-1521Google Scholar, 17Schlesinger P.H. Blair H.C. Teitelbaum S.L. Edwards J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18636-18643Google Scholar). The specific polyclonal anti-CLIC5B antibody was raised against the peptide containing amino acids 14–26 (QNERTYEVPDPEE) of the deduced amino acid sequence of CLIC5B (New England Peptides). The peptide was synthesized in the Medical College of Georgia Molecular Biology Core Facility. The goat polyclonal antibody was affinity-purified using the CLIC5B peptide coupled to the Aminolink system (Pierce) and eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5. HCA-7 cells were incubated in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors (Sigma)) for 5 min on ice and spun at 1000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. 300 μg of the HCA-7 lysate proteins were incubated with the 15 μl of 656 anti-CLIC antisera for 2 h at room temperature. Dynabeads M-280 sheep anti-rabbit IgG were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with protease inhibitors for 10 min at room temperature and then blocked using 0.2% bovine serum albumin and protease inhibitors (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. The lysate/antibody mixture was then incubated with the blocked Dynabeads M-280 sheep anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h at room temperature (Dynal). The beads were washed with PBS with protease inhibitors three times for 15 min. The beads were then boiled in the presence of 1% SDS and 1/5 volume of 2-mercaptoethanol. The samples were separated on a 3–10% gradient SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blot analysis. HCA-7 cells were grown to confluence and washed in PBS. The cells were scraped in PBS and pelleted at 200 × g for 5 min at 4 C. The cells were then homogenized in ice-cold 250 mm sucrose, 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitors (Sigma) using a Potter Teflon-on-glass homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 4 °C sequentially at 1,000 × g for 5 min (P0), 5,000 × g for 15 min (P1), 17,000 × gfor 20 min (P2), and 100,000 × g for 60 min (P3). The pellets were resuspended in PBS containing protease inhibitors and the high speed supernatant (S3) was also saved. HCA-7 cell homogenates and the different subcellular fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE using 3–10% gradient gels for AKAP350 (14G2) and 10% gels for pan-CLIC (656) and anti-CLIC5B antibodies. For AKAP350 detection, gels were transferred for 2 h at 750 mA to nitrocellulose, whereas for other antibodies gels were transferred overnight at 100 mA to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P). Blots were blocked with 5% nonfat milk/Tris-buffered saline (TBS), 0.5% Tween 20 and then probed with 14G2 (1:500), 656 (1:500), or anti-CLIC5B (1:50) in 3% bovine serum albumin/TBS-Tween for 1 h at room temperature. After being washed three times with TBS-Tween, blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:2500), anti-rabbit IgG (1:20000), or anti-goat IgG (1:10000) in 1% nonfat milk/TBS-Tween. Blots were finally washed three times with TBS-Tween and three times with TBS, and immunoreactivity was detected with chemiluminescence (Supersignal, Pierce) and subsequent exposure to BioMax film (Kodak). Total RNA were prepared from HCA-7 cells using RNASTAT-60 (Teltest). The Advantage RT for PCR kit (Clontech) was used to construct cDNA from 2 μg of HCA-7 total RNA using random hexamer primers. Gene-specific primers were constructed at the putative start site of CLIC5B and at the termination site for CLIC5A (sense: GCGCGAATTCCCATGAATGACGAAGACTACAGCACCA, antisense: GCGCGTCGACCTGGATCGGCTGAGGCGTTTGGCGACATCAG), and products were amplified using Advantage Polymerase (Clontech) with 40 cycles: 95 °C 15 s, 60 °C 10 s, 68 °C 120 s. The resulting product was cloned into pTOPO (Invitrogen) and the insert was sequenced with flanking vector primers. A human multi-tissue Northern blot was purchased from Origene. The blot was sequentially probed with a 336 nucleotide probe corresponding to the 5′ end of human CLIC5A (nucleotides 1–336, GenBank™ accession number AF216941) or a 516 nucleotide probe corresponding to the 5′ end human CLIC5B (nucleotides 1–516 GenBank™ accession number AY032602). Blots were probed overnight at 42 °C and then washed to high stringency (0.1X SSC, 65 °C). Blots were exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C for 24 h. HCA-7 cells were grown on glass coverslips to confluence. The cells were then incubated in the absence or presence of 10 μg/ml brefeldin A for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were blocked with 17% donkey serum, 0.3% Triton-X100 in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated simultaneously with 14G2 (mouse anti-AKAP350) (1:85), mouse anti-p58 (1:100), and/or affinity-purified goat anti-CLIC5B (1:5) for 2 h at room temperature. The cells were then simultaneously incubated with Alexa-488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for 60 min. Coverslips were inverted and mounted with Prolong antifade. Cells were examined for triple labeling by confocal microscopy (Amersham Biosciences) using maximum intensity projections of 0.3 μm optical sections in the apical region of the cell. GFP-CLIC5B-(178–410) was amplified utilizing primers specific for exons 2–6 shared by CLIC5A and CLIC5B (sense: GCGCGAATTCTTTGTGAAGGCTGGAATCGATGGAGA and antisense: GCGCGTCGACCTGGATCGGCTGAGGCGTTTGGCGACATCAG). EcoRI andSalI sites were utilized to clone into EGFP-C2 (Clontech). This construct was transfected with Effectene (Qiagen) into HCA-7 cells, which were grown on glass coverslips overnight. Some cells were treated with 10 μg/ml brefeldin A for 1 h at 37 °C as detailed above. Cells were fixed and stained as described above. AKAP350 interacts with several signaling proteins including protein phosphatase 1, protein kinase N, protein phosphatase 2A (8Takahashi M. Shibata H. Shimakawa M. Miyamoto M. Mukai H. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17267-17274Google Scholar), protein kinase Cε (11Takahashi M. Mukai H. Oishi K. Isagawa T. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34592-34596Google Scholar) and Type II protein kinase A (Fig.1 A) (7Schmidt P.H. Dransfield D.T. Claudio J.O. Hawley R.G. Trotter K.W. Milgram S.L. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3055-3066Google Scholar, 8Takahashi M. Shibata H. Shimakawa M. Miyamoto M. Mukai H. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17267-17274Google Scholar). To investigate further the function of AKAP350 as a scaffolding protein, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a rabbit parietal cell library. We screened the library with a 3.2-kb segment of AKAP350, previously termed the PHR (7Schmidt P.H. Dransfield D.T. Claudio J.O. Hawley R.G. Trotter K.W. Milgram S.L. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3055-3066Google Scholar) because of its weak homology (41% similarity) with the centrosomal protein, pericentrin (Fig.1 A). One positive clone was identified as a full-length cDNA of the rabbit homologue of human CLIC1 (NCC27) (GenBankTM accession number U93205). Subsequent yeast two-hybrid binary assays confirmed the interaction of rabbit CLIC1 with the PHR of AKAP350. The rabbit CLIC1 sequence and deletion constructs of the PHR of AKAP350 were used in yeast two-hybrid binary assays to map the rabbit CLIC1 binding site in AKAP350. The CLIC binding region of AKAP350 was limited to a 133-amino acid region between amino acids 1388 and 1515 of AKAP350 (Fig. 1 B). To characterize the CLIC/AKAP350 interaction, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed using a rabbit polyclonal anti-CLIC antibody, 656. This antibody was chosen for its ability to recognize a range of CLIC family members. The antibody was developed against a region of the carboxyl terminus of the avian CLIC, p62, and is known to recognize avian p62, bovine p64 (17Schlesinger P.H. Blair H.C. Teitelbaum S.L. Edwards J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18636-18643Google Scholar), and human CLIC1 and CLIC4. 2J. C. Edwards, unpublished results. Fig.2 A demonstrates that, in extracts of HCA-7 cells, the pan-CLIC 656 antibody recognized major bands of 31, 32, and 46 kDa as well as a minor band at 85 kDa. Beads with only anti-rabbit antibody or beads coated with the anti-pan-CLIC antibody, 656, were incubated with 1% Nonidet P-40 extracts from HCA-7 human colon adenocarcinoma cells. The bound protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis with the monoclonal anti-AKAP350 antibody, 14G2. The anti-CLIC antibody 656 specifically immunoprecipitated AKAP350 when compared with beads coated only with anti-rabbit antibody (Fig. 2 B). The Western blot analysis with antibody 656 confirmed that it did not recognize AKAP350 (data not shown). These biochemical data confirmed the in situassociation of AKAP350 with a CLIC family member in HCA-7 cells. As noted in Fig. 2 A, the 656 pan-CLIC antibody recognized at least four discrete proteins in HCA-7 cells. The 31- and 32-kDa bands could represent CLIC1 and CLIC4 because of their apparent molecular mass and the known ability of the 656 antibody to cross-react with CLIC1 and CLIC4.2 Previously, no CLIC protein had been described as migrating at 46 kDa. Another pan-CLIC rabbit polyclonal antibody (121), which recognizes the conserved CLIC carboxyl terminus of CLIC1 (14Berryman M. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1509-1521Google Scholar), also recognized a 46-kDa band in HCA-7 cells (data not shown). We employed several specific CLIC antibodies to determine whether they recognized this protein. Antibodies specific for CLIC1 and parchorin did not recognize this protein (data not shown). However, only a polyclonal antibody affinity-purified against CLIC5 (B132) did recognize a 46-kDa band (data not shown). These results suggested that a CLIC5 immunoreactive protein might represent the 46-kDa CLIC species in HCA-7 cells. The high homology between bovine p64 and the more recently documented CLIC5 led us to hypothesize that a CLIC5 splice variant might represent a human homologue of bovine p64 (13Landry D. Sullivan S. Nicolaides M. Redhead C. Edelman A. Field M., Al- Awqati Q. Edwards J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14948-14955Google Scholar, 14Berryman M. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1509-1521Google Scholar). Human CLIC5 and bovine p64 show extensive identity in their carboxyl termini but have little similarity in their amino-terminal sequences. We performed a search with the 5′ coding sequence from bovine p64 against genomic BAC sequences containing the human CLIC5 cDNA. This search revealed an alternate initiation site for CLIC5 that is present 65 kb upstream of the published start site of human CLIC5 (Fig.3). Utilizing a sense primer against this putative alternative start site and an antisense primer against the 3′ end of the CLIC5 coding sequence, we were able to amplify a 1230-bp sequence from HCA-7 cell cDNA (Fig. 3). This sequence encodes for a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 46 kDa, corresponding to the molecular weight of the CLIC-immunoreactive band detected by the 656 antibody (Fig. 2 A). We named this protein CLIC5B (GenBankTM accession number AY032602) and have renamed the previously published CLIC5 as CLIC5A (14Berryman M. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1509-1521Google Scholar). The only difference between these proteins is found in their first exons. The first exon of CLIC5A encodes for its first 21 amino acids, whereas the first exon of CLIC5B encodes for its first 180 amino acids (Fig. 3 B). Because human CLIC5B shows 72% identity with bovine p64, CLIC5B most likely represents the human homologue of bovine p64. To determine the tissue distribution of these two proteins, Northern blot analysis of 12 different human tissues was performed. Due to the CLIC5 splicing, we designed a CLIC5A-specific probe that included a region of the 5′ untranslated sequence and the unique first exon of CLIC5A. The message size of CLIC5A was consistent with the previously published size of 6.4 kb (14Berryman M. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1509-1521Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 A). We found the highest expression in the lung, with a lower level of message in the heart, kidney, and skeletal muscle than previously reported with a probe designed against full-length CLIC5A (13Landry D. Sullivan S. Nicolaides M. Redhead C. Edelman A. Field M., Al- Awqati Q. Edwards J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14948-14955Google Scholar). CLIC5A mRNA was also detected in the colon and placenta upon longer exposure of the blot to film (data not shown). As Berryman and Bretscher (14Berryman M. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1509-1521Google Scholar) described, the CLIC5A-specific probe also recognized less intense bands at 3.8 and 2.3 kb in some tissues (data not shown). A probe designed against the unique first exon of CLIC5B was used to evaluate the tissue distribution of CLIC5B. CLIC5B expression was detected only in the small intestine. The CLIC5B mRNA migrated at a slightly higher size (6.6 kb) than CLIC5A (Fig. 4 B). The CLIC family of proteins is defined by their high homology in their carboxyl termini, which contain two conserved putative transmembrane domains (18Valenzuela S.M. Marin D.K. Por S.B. Robbins J.M. Warton K. Bootcov M.R. Schofield P.R. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12575-12582Google Scholar). To determine the specificity of AKAP350 binding for members of the CLIC family, clones of human CLIC1, CLIC4, CLIC5A, CLIC5B, and rabbit parchorin (14Berryman M. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1509-1521Google Scholar, 16Nishizawa T. Nagao T. Iwatsubo T. Forte J.G. Urushidani T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11164-11173Google Scholar) were paired with AKAP350 in yeast two-hybrid binary assays. Each of these CLIC family members interacted with AKAP350 (Fig.5 A). These results suggested that the conserved carboxyl terminus in the CLIC family contained the binding site for AKAP350 (Fig. 5 A). Constructs containing the first and second halves of the conserved region of CLIC5B were used in yeast two-hybrid binary assays to determine the region responsible for binding to AKAP350. The binding region was contained in the final 120 amino acids of CLIC5B. The entire region was necessary for the binding of AKAP350 to CLIC5B, because any further truncations of this region were unable to bind to AKAP350 (Fig.5 B). This region contains extensive identity in all CLIC family members (Fig. 5 B). In an accompanying paper (19Shanks R.A. Steadman B.T. Schmidt P.H. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40967-40972Google Scholar), we have characterized AKAP350A as a Golgi apparatus-specific splice variant of AKAP350. To explore the localization of AKAP350 and CLIC5B, we prepared a goat polyclonal antiserum against CLIC5B-specific peptide sequence. Fig.6 demonstrates that antibodies against CLCI5B detected a single 46-kDa band in fractions of HCA-7 cells with the highest concentrations in heavy microsomes and the high speed supernatant. All CLIC5B immunoreactivity was abolished by incubation with 10 μm competing CLIC5B peptide (data not shown). AKAP350 was also present in these fractions but was also detected in the lighter microsomal fractions. Because the patterns of AKAP350 and CLIC5B immunoreactivity were overlapping but not identical, CLIC5B antibodies were used to stain HCA-7 cells. Fig. 7 Ademonstrates that, although considerable cytosolic staining was observed, CLIC5B immunoreactivity localized to the Golgi with extensive colocalization with the p58 Golgi marker. A pan-CLIC antibody (121) also demonstrated strong staining of the Golgi apparatus (data not shown). Treatment of cells with brefeldin A led to disruption of the Golgi and vesiculation of p58 staining with dispersal of CLIC5B staining into a predominantly cytosolic distribution (Fig.7 A). We also observed colocalization of CLIC5B with AKAP350 staining with the 14G2 monoclonal antibody (Fig. 7 B). Brefeldin A treatment dispersed the Golgi staining by both CLIC5B and AKAP350 antibodies. However, in brefeldin-treated cells, it was also apparent that a small amount of CLIC5B staining was also present at centrosomes in which AKAP350 staining was unaltered by brefeldin treatment (Fig. 7 B). These results demonstrate that CLIC5B localizes predominantly to the Golgi apparatus, with a lesser association with the centrosome. To clarify the localization of CLIC5B with the Golgi apparatus, a GFP-chimera (GFP-CLIC5B-(178–410)) was constructed utilizing amino acids 178–410 of CLIC5B. This region represents the shared exons 2–6 of CLIC5A and CLIC5B (Fig. 4). The HCA-7 cells were then stained with the Golgi apparatus marker p58 (Fig.8). HCA-7 cells expressing GFP-CLIC5B-(178–410) displayed colocalization with the Golgi apparatus. Staining with the anti-AKAP350 14G2 antibody was unchanged in cells expressing this GFP-chimera (data not shown). Treatment of cells with brefeldin A caused dispersal of GFP-CLIC5B-(178–410), confirming its localization to the Golgi apparatus (data not shown). These data suggest that the region coding for exons 2–6 is sufficient for the targeting of CLIC5B to the Golgi apparatus. AKAPs scaffold signaling proteins to specific locations required for specialized functions throughout cells. The signaling proteins associated with an AKAP often define the functions of these scaffolds (5Dodge K. Scott J.D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 58-61Google Scholar). In this report, we have identified the interaction of AKAP350 with CLIC family members, specifically the colocalization of CLIC5B and AKAP350 at the Golgi apparatus of HCA-7 cells. For the first time, these results demonstrate the interaction at the Golgi apparatus of AKAP350 with an effector protein with no known enzymatic activity. In addition, these studies establish a mechanism for the scaffolding of CLIC proteins at discrete locations within the cell. The CLIC protein family consists of seven members, all of which have several common attributes. The family consists of parchorin, bovine p64, and CLIC1-CLIC5. Each protein in this family has a high amino acid homology at the carboxyl-terminal end of the protein. This homologous region consists of ∼200 amino acids and contains a putative hydrophobic membrane-spanning domain. Although expression patterns and localization differ for each of the family members, all of these CLIC proteins associate with membranous organelles. The data presented here suggest that the CLIC5 gene encodes for at least two gene products. Northern blot analysis for CLIC5A and CLIC5B also demonstrated different mRNA expression patterns for these proteins. Multiple message sizes have been reported for CLIC1, CLIC4, CLIC5A, and p64 (13Landry D. Sullivan S. Nicolaides M. Redhead C. Edelman A. Field M., Al- Awqati Q. Edwards J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14948-14955Google Scholar, 14Berryman M. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1509-1521Google Scholar, 20Qian Z. Okuhara D. Abe M.K. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1621-1627Google Scholar, 21Edwards J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F398-F408Google Scholar, 22Tulk B.M. Edwards J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F1140-F1149Google Scholar), suggesting that each of the members of this family of proteins contains several multiply spliced species. Because of the high homology among CLIC family members in their carboxyl termini, amino-terminal region splicing events could provide distinguishing characteristics enabling a single gene to encode for proteins with a diverse range of functions. Berryman and Bretscher (14Berryman M. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1509-1521Google Scholar) utilized the full-length CLIC5A cDNA as a probe to perform Northern analysis of a multi-tissue blot. To distinguish CLIC5A from CLIC5B, we utilized probes specific for the unique first exons of CLIC5A and CLIC5B. The CLIC5B probe recognized a single 6.6-kb message detectable only in the small intestine. The CLIC5B message was slightly longer than the CLIC5A message of 6.4 kb observed in several tissues (14Berryman M. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1509-1521Google Scholar). Interestingly, the CLIC5A-specific probe still recognized other shorter message sizes of 3.8 and 2.3 kb (data not shown), which correlates with the reported mRNA sizes observed with the probe designed against full-length CLIC5A (14Berryman M. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1509-1521Google Scholar). These smaller mRNAs could represent shorter message sizes created from splicing events downstream of the first exon. The bovine homologue of CLIC5B (p64) also showed similar multiple message sizes by Northern analysis (13Landry D. Sullivan S. Nicolaides M. Redhead C. Edelman A. Field M., Al- Awqati Q. Edwards J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14948-14955Google Scholar). The differences observed between each of these studies warrants further investigation to determine the functional diversity of CLIC5/p64 splice variants. Previous studies have demonstrated the association of CLIC family members with the cytoskeleton (CLIC5A), nucleus (CLIC3, CLIC1), Golgi apparatus (bovine p64), mitochondria (CLIC4), and the sub-apical membrane compartment (CLIC1, CLIC4, CLIC5A, and parchorin) (13Landry D. Sullivan S. Nicolaides M. Redhead C. Edelman A. Field M., Al- Awqati Q. Edwards J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14948-14955Google Scholar, 14Berryman M. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1509-1521Google Scholar, 16Nishizawa T. Nagao T. Iwatsubo T. Forte J.G. Urushidani T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11164-11173Google Scholar,20Qian Z. Okuhara D. Abe M.K. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1621-1627Google Scholar, 21Edwards J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F398-F408Google Scholar, 23Fernandez-Salas E. Sagar M. Cheng C. Yuspa S.H. Weinberg W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36488-36497Google Scholar). Targeting domains in CLICs responsible for their localization have not been elucidated. The 46-kDa CLIC5B protein appears to be a major immunoreactive CLIC in HCA-7 cells. Immunocytochemical studies demonstrated the predominant localization of CLIC5B immunoreactivity with the Golgi apparatus in HCA-7 cells. CLIC5B, formed through an alternate initiation site of theCLIC5A gene, most likely represents the human homologue of bovine p64. CLIC5B and p64 share 72% identity; p64 was originally isolated from kidney microsomes containing Golgi apparatus markers (13Landry D. Sullivan S. Nicolaides M. Redhead C. Edelman A. Field M., Al- Awqati Q. Edwards J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14948-14955Google Scholar). Interestingly, the region conserved in CLIC5A and CLIC5B (exons 2–6) localized to the Golgi apparatus when overexpressed as a GFP-chimera protein in HCA-7 cells. Therefore, the ability to localize to the Golgi apparatus is at least partially maintained in the conserved region of CLIC5A and CLIC5B. Previous studies have localized CLIC5A predominantly to the supapical compartment (14Berryman M. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1509-1521Google Scholar). The first exon of CLIC5A may therefore code for a motif required for Golgi apparatus export or targeting to the apical membrane domain. Although AKAP350 can bind to CLIC5B and could sequester it to the Golgi apparatus, we have shown that AKAP350 can potentially bind to all CLIC family members. Therefore, interactions with AKAP350 may not be sufficient for organelle-specific targeting of CLIC family members. The association of AKAP350 and CLIC5B was affected by structural changes in the Golgi apparatus. In brefeldin A-treated HCA-7 cells, both CLIC5B and AKAP350 staining were dispersed in the cytosol. These data suggest that the structural integrity of the Golgi apparatus is necessary for the association of CLIC5B and AKAP350 with the Golgi cisternae. These results support a model for AKAP350 scaffolding of CLIC5B at the assembled trans-Golgi cisternae. In addition, Western analyses demonstrate a large amount of both CLIC5B and AKAP350 protein in the supernatant fraction after homogenization. These data suggest a dynamic association of CLIC5B with AKAP350, providing a mechanism for the modulation of CLIC function at the Golgi apparatus. Although the function of CLIC5B at the Golgi apparatus is unclear, previous studies have described CLIC family members as independent channels. Harrop et al. (24Harrop S.J. DeMaere M.Z. Fairlie W.D. Reztsova R. Valenzuela S.M. Mazzanti M. Tonini R. Qui M.R. Jankova L. Warton D. Bauskin A.R., Wu, W.M. Pankhurst S. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. Curni P.M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44993-45000Google Scholar) have recently described a 23-amino acid sequence in carboxyl terminus of CLIC1 as a putative transmembrane domain. Indeed, this region is highly conserved among all of the CLIC family members. A mounting volume of evidence describes the CLIC proteins as potential integral membrane proteins that can exist as cytosolic and/or membrane proteins based on a significant conformational change in the amino terminus (24Harrop S.J. DeMaere M.Z. Fairlie W.D. Reztsova R. Valenzuela S.M. Mazzanti M. Tonini R. Qui M.R. Jankova L. Warton D. Bauskin A.R., Wu, W.M. Pankhurst S. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. Curni P.M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44993-45000Google Scholar, 25Tulk B.M. Kapadia S. Edwards J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1103-C1112Google Scholar). This new conformation would expose the putative transmembrane domain. The large conformational change required in CLIC1 for the exposure of this domain could require signaling through kinases and phosphatases. Because AKAP350 contains putative binding sites for protein phosphatase 1, protein kinase N, protein phosphatase 2A (8Takahashi M. Shibata H. Shimakawa M. Miyamoto M. Mukai H. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17267-17274Google Scholar), protein kinase Cε (11Takahashi M. Mukai H. Oishi K. Isagawa T. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34592-34596Google Scholar), phosphodiesterase 4D3 (12Tasken K.A Collas P. Kemmner W.A. Witczak O. Conti M. Tasken K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21999-22002Google Scholar), and protein kinase A (7Schmidt P.H. Dransfield D.T. Claudio J.O. Hawley R.G. Trotter K.W. Milgram S.L. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3055-3066Google Scholar, 8Takahashi M. Shibata H. Shimakawa M. Miyamoto M. Mukai H. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17267-17274Google Scholar), it is conceivable that these enzymes could play a role in the function of CLIC5B as well as other CLIC family members. Edwards and colleagues (26Edwards J.C. Tulk B. Schlesinger P.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 163: 119-127Google Scholar) have suggested that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the CLIC5B bovine homologue, p64, has an effect on its ability to control chloride movement. Further investigations into the function of CLIC5B as a chloride anion channel will have to be completed before it can be determined whether this CLIC protein mediates chloride movement at the Golgi apparatus. Signaling events will likely control the movement and function of the CLIC family of proteins. In this report, we describe the interaction of all CLIC family members with a conserved region found in all AKAP350 splice variants (7Schmidt P.H. Dransfield D.T. Claudio J.O. Hawley R.G. Trotter K.W. Milgram S.L. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3055-3066Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that other CLIC family members will be scaffolded by AKAP350 in other intracellular locations in particular cell types. Although we have not established that AKAP350 is present wherever CLIC family members are localized, a more comprehensive study of other cell types could lead to the discovery of other AKAP350/CLIC interactions. This interaction is intriguing because of the diversity of localized signaling molecules that AKAP350 can potentially target to control the function of CLICs. Many of the CLIC family members share phosphorylation motifs for enzymes scaffolded by AKAP350. For example CLIC4, p64, CLIC5A, and CLIC5B all share a conserved protein kinase A phosphorylation site in their extreme carboxyl termini (27Martin M.E. Hidalgo J. Vega F.M. Velasco A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3869-3878Google Scholar, 28Molloy S.S. Thomas L. Kamibayasi C. Mumby M.C. Thomas G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1399-1411Google Scholar). Thus, cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of CLIC proteins by protein kinase A could regulate their distribution and function. In summary, we have described the interaction of CLIC family members with AKAP350. In HCA-7 cells, CLIC5B, the human homologue of bovine p64, colocalizes predominantly with AKAP350 at the Golgi apparatus with lesser localization at the centrosome. This report represents the first demonstration of AKAP350 with a non-enzymatic effector protein at the Golgi apparatus. These studies indicate that AKAP350 not only scaffolds enzymatic signaling molecules but also conveys organelle-specific interactions with non-kinase/phosphatase effector molecules. The relationships between the signaling proteins scaffolded to AKAP350 and CLIC proteins will provide further insights into the function of the CLIC family of proteins and AKAP350 in specific subcellular compartments.

The present study suggests that regulation of GH receptor (GHR) levels in rat hepatoma cells by repeated GH stimulation determines GH responsiveness via the JAK2/STAT5 pathway. A short exposure to GH rapidly reduced GHR levels which resulted in an equal desensitization of the JAK2/STAT5 pathway. Recovery of GH-induced STAT5 phosphorylation correlated with the time-dependent recovery of GHR levels during incubation in the absence of GH. Acute GH also induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt, and this induction was also inhibited by prior exposure to GH. However, unlike the JAK2/STAT5 pathway, the effect of GH to activate the MEK/ERK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathways did not recover following prolonged incubation in the absence of GH. Thus, GH administration desensitizes the JAK2/STAT5 pathway, possibly because of down-regulation of GHR, whereas an additional post-receptor mechanism is required for the prolonged refractoriness of the MEK/ERK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathways toward a second GH stimulation. Our study suggests that both receptor and post-receptor mechanisms are important in GH-induced homologous desensitization.

Elucidation of the processes of this homologous desensitization may further our understanding of the regulation of GH action, as well as the possible effects of GH on intracellular signaling molecules that are also utilized by other hormones, cytokines, and growth factors. GH is secreted in a pulsatile fashion to promote growth and diverse metabolic actions (1Isaksson O.G. Eden S. Jansson J.O. Annu. Rev.

In young adult male rats, GH is released in ∼1-h pulses with peak serum concentrations of 150–400 ng/ml, and interpulse intervals of 2 h or more, where serum GH concentrations are negligible (3Tannenbaum G.S. Martin J.B. Endocrinology. 1976; 98: 562-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). In female rats, GH is secreted more frequently, resulting in the continuous presence of GH in the circulation, with peaks of 50–150 ng/ml (2Jansson J.O. Eden S. Isaksson O. Endocr.

Although GH activates ERK in the hepatocyte when either injected into animals or when added directly to cultured hepatocytes (18Yamauchi T. Ueki K. Tobe K. Tamemoto H. Sekine N. Wada M. Honjo M.

Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3980-3986Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), it is not known whether repeated GH pulses, as is normally present in vivo, cause multiple spikes of activated (phosphorylated) ERK. Desensitization and resensitization are critical processes regulating GH actions on target tissues. In hypophysectomized rats, a second GH exposure can trigger a full hepatic response of STAT5 tyrosyl phosphorylation (PY-STAT5) if it follows the first injection by 4 h (7Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5929-5940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 22Waxman D.J. Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13262-13270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In a rat hepatocyte-derived cell line, full responsiveness to succeeding GH stimulation via the JAK2/STAT5 pathway requires a minimum of 2.5 h without GH (23Gebert C.A. Park S.H. Waxman D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 400-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that the liver and liver-derived cells undergo an obligatory recovery period after stimulation by a GH pulse (23Gebert C.A. Park S.H. Waxman D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 400-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Two general mechanisms may underlie the requirement for a recovery period for resensitization of GH-induced signaling. First, the recovery period could allow restoration of a short term decrease of cell-surface GHR following a cycle of GH binding, receptor internalization, and degradation or recycling. Alternatively, the period may be required to reset GH-activated intracellular signaling pathways. Important post-receptor mechanisms of desensitization of GH may involve changes in the cellular expression of members of the family of suppressor of cytokine signaling, or cytokine-inducible SH2 proteins (24Yoshimura A.

Another post-receptor mechanism for the post-GH pulse recovery period may be the regulation of phosphatase activity (31Gebert C.A. Park S.H. Waxman D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 38-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, for this to be an operative mechanism, a time-dependent induction followed by reduction of phosphatase activity coincident with the inhibition and then recovery of GH responsiveness would be required, and has not yet been demonstrated. It is clear that GH induces rapid internalization of GHR, but there is conflicting evidence concerning whether GHR is degraded following internalization (23Gebert C.A. Park S.H. Waxman D.J. Mol.

In the present study, using rat hepatoma H4IIE (H4) cells, both desensitization of the JAK2/STAT5 pathway following initial GH stimulation and the recovery of GH sensitivity of this pathway during a GH-free incubation period were strongly correlated with reduction and recovery, respectively, of GHR levels. Therefore we hypothesize that, with repeated GH applications, a major mechanism of desensitization and resensitization of GH signaling and JAK2/STAT5 activation was the result of reduction and recovery of GHR levels. However, following a 1-h exposure to GH, even 16 h in its absence was insufficient to obtain a recovery of the GH-induced pathways of MEK/ERK and PI 3-kinase/Akt. This lack of recovery of MEK/ERK and PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling indicates that recovery of GHR and JAK2/STAT5 signaling was insufficient for recovery of all GHR signaling capabilities. There must be at least one additional post-receptor desensitization mechanism that results in reduced GH signaling even when GHR levels are restored. Bovine GH (bGH; lot APF10325C) was kindly provided by Dr. A. F. Parlow, Pituitary Hormones and Antisera Center, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center (Torrance, CA) and the National Institutes of Health NIDDK National Hormone & Pituitary Program. Fetal bovine serum, calf serum, and horse serum were purchased from Invitrogen. Enhanced chemiluminescent detection reagents were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Other materials were purchased from Sigma and Fisher unless otherwise noted. Anti-STAT5 monoclonal antibody (raised against amino acids 451–649 of sheep STAT5A shared by STAT5A and STAT5B) was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Thus, this antibody reacts with both STAT5A and STAT5B. A mouse anti-STAT5B (raised against the unique C terminus of murine STAT5B) monoclonal antibody and a rabbit anti-phosphotyrosine-STAT5 polyclonal antibody (raised against the phosphopeptide around C-terminal Tyr-694 of murine STAT5A that is conserved in both STAT5A and STAT5B of human, sheep, and rat) were obtained from Zymed Laboratories (San Francisco, CA). A rabbit anti-JAK2 peptide antiserum, directed at residues 758–776 of murine JAK2, was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Two anti-GHR antisera were raised in rabbits against peptides of the cytoplasmic domain of the GHR: anti-GHRcyt3728 (GHR3728) against residues 317–620 of the human GHR cytoplasmic domain and anti-GHRcytAL37 (GHR-AL37) against residues 271–620 fused to glutathione S-transferase as described (39Jiang J. Liang L. Kim S.O. Zhang Y. Mandler R. Frank S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 774-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 40Frank S.J. Gilliland G. Van Epps C. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA): rabbit antibodies for ERK; MEK1/2; Akt; P-ERK1/2, which can detect dual phosphorylation of Thr-183 and Tyr-185 of rat ERK1/2; P-MEK1/2, which can detect dual phosphorylation of Ser-217 and Ser-221 or single phosphorylation of Ser-217; and P-Akt, which can detect Akt1 only when phosphorylated at Ser-473 and Akt2 and Akt3 only when phosphorylated at equivalent sites. Secondary antibodies including the peroxidase-linked sheep anti-mouse serum and the peroxidase-linked donkey anti-rabbit serum were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Other secondary antibodies such as the donkey anti-goat IgG were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rat H4-II-E (H4) hepatoma cells were cultured in Swim's medium supplemented with 10% serum (5% horse serum, 3% newborn calf serum, and 2% fetal calf serum) and 2 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate (41Messina J.L. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). At ∼50% confluence, cells were removed from serum and maintained in serum-free (and bovine serum albumin-free) medium for 48 h prior to the start of experimental treatments. For the washing experiments, following the first exposure to GH the medium was removed by aspiration, the cells were gently rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, followed by addition of GH-free, serum-free Swim's medium. Hormone treatment (detailed in the text) was terminated by rinsing the cells once with 20 °C TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl), cells were collected in 20 °C SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 0.5 mmNa3VO4) and boiled for 5 min, and the cell lysates were rigorously homogenized. One volume of 4× Laemmli sample buffer (8% SDS, 250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 40% glycerol, 4% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% bromphenol blue) was added to three volumes of whole cell lysates, and the solution was boiled for an additional 5 min and stored at −80 °C until subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein lysates in Laemmli sample buffer were then subjected to 9–12% gradient SDS-PAGE. Western transfer of proteins was performed as described previously, except for the use of Protran membrane from Schleicher & Schuell (BA 85; Ref. 40Frank S.J. Gilliland G. Van Epps C. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The membranes were blocked in 0.4% milk, 5% bovine serum albumin in TBS, 0.7% Tween 20, pH 8.0. Immunoblotting was performed with the antibodies at the following dilutions: anti-STAT5 (1:500), anti-STAT5B (1:5000), anti-PY-STAT5 (1:5000), anti-GHR-AL37 (1:2000), anti-JAK2 (1:2000), anti-IR (1:1000), anti-ERK1/2 (1:1000), anti-Akt (1:1000), anti-MEK1/2 (1:1000), anti-P-ERK1/2 (1:1000), anti-P-Akt (1:1000), anti-P-MEK (1:1000) with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:2000). Incubation with rabbit primary antisera was at 4 °C overnight, whereas incubation with mouse monoclonal antibodies was at room temperature for 1 h. Washing times after primary and secondary antibodies were at room temperature for 10 and 20 min, respectively. All primary antibodies were used in 0.7% Tween 20 in TBS, pH 8.0, with 0.02% azide. Detection of bound antibodies by enhanced chemiluminescence and stripping and reprobing of blots were accomplished according to the manufacturer's suggestions. All blots measuring phosphorylated proteins were reprobed at least twice, the second probing using an antibody to detect total amounts (phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated) of the same protein. These repeat probings were to ensure even loading from lane to lane and an unchanging amount of the total protein following experimental treatments; several of the reprobed Westerns are included in the figures. Enhanced chemiluminescent images of immunoblots were analyzed by scanning densitometry. Multiple exposures of each blot were used to obtain gray-scale images of each chemiluminescent band and were quantified with the Scion Image Analysis program (release beta 2) from Scion Corp. (Frederick, MD). All data were analyzed by analysis of variance using the InStat statistical program (version 3) by GraphPad Software, Inc. (San Diego, CA). The kinetics of GH-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of STAT5 (PY-STAT5) in H4 cells was examined. Because plasma GH levels can vary between 0 and 400 (or higher) ng/ml in young adult male rats and between 50 and 150 ng/ml in young adult female rats (4Eden S. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1978; 458: 1-54PubMed Google Scholar, 5Eden S. Albertsson-Wikland K. Isaksson O. Acta Endocrinol. 1978; 88: 676-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), bGH at concentrations of 50–500 ng/ml were used. The highest concentration of bGH, 500 ng/ml, resulted in a large induction of PY-STAT5 at all points tested between 5 and 60 min following its addition to the cell culture media (Fig.1 A), compared with vehicle-treated control cells (lane 10). This large induction diminished after 60 min, returning toward basal values by 90 min (Fig. 1 A). Addition of bGH at various doses resulted in maximum levels of PY-STAT5 that were clearly dose-dependent. Designating the 30-min time point of the 500 ng/ml concentration of bGH as 100%, the maximal effects of bGH at 100 and 50 ng/ml at 30 min were ∼60 and 50%, respectively (Fig.1 B and additional data not shown). When multiple time-course experiments were averaged, it is evident that peak PY-STAT5 was achieved most rapidly at 500 ng/ml and was slowest at 50 ng/ml (Fig.1 C). The relative levels of immunoreactive GHR before or following GH treatment were determined by Western blot analysis. Using an antibody against the cytoplasmic domain of human GHR (GHR3728), which cross-reacts with rat GHR (42Ji S. Guan R. Frank S.J. Messina J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13434-13442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), treatment with bGH (500 ng/ml) for 0–60 min resulted in reduction of GHR levels by ∼75% (Fig. 2 A). Using a second, independently raised antibody against a different yet overlapping cytoplasmic domain of human GHR (GHR-AL37; Ref. 42Ji S. Guan R. Frank S.J. Messina J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13434-13442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the levels of GHR following 0–60-min treatment with bGH at different doses were also determined. These experiments confirmed the earlier studies that GHR levels were reduced following bGH at 50, 100, and 200 ng/ml, as well as with 500 ng/ml for 5–60 min, with maximum reductions to ∼20–30% of the control levels at 60 min at all concentrations of bGH tested (Fig. 2 B). Similar to induction of PY-STAT5, the fastest reduction of GHR levels occurred in H4 cells treated with the highest concentration (500 ng/ml) of bGH. Growth hormone is secreted in ∼1-h pulses in young adult male rats, with interpulse intervals of non-detectable GH greater than 2 h. To mimic this temporal pattern of GH exposure, H4 cells were pretreated with bGH at 50, 100, 200, and 500 ng/ml for 1 h, after which the GH was washed away and the cell incubated for 3 h in GH-free, serum-free medium. Compared with untreated cells, those treated with bGH (500 ng/ml) for 1 h followed by 3 h in GH-free, serum-free medium possessed levels of immunoreactive GHR that were ∼50% of that in the untreated sample (Figs.3 (row 1,lane 7 versus lane 6) and 4A). Because this is higher than the amount following GH for 60 min without the 3 h in GH-free, serum-free medium (Figs. 2 B and 3(row 1, lane 7 versus lane 5)), it suggests that there was a partial recovery of GHR levels during the 3-h wash-out period (see the next section). At the beginning of the second bGH application, and at each treatment time point thereafter, there were lower GHR levels following the second versus the first exposure to bGH for 5–60 min. Thus, after a 1-h GH treatment and 3 h in GH-free, serum-free media, there was a lower level of GHR, and cellular GHR could be further decreased by a second exposure to 500 ng/ml bGH (Figs. 3 and 4 A). Similar results were obtained with bGH at 50 ng/ml (Fig. 4 B) and at 100 and 200 ng/ml (data not shown). The GH-induced reduction in GHR levels was faster at 500 versus 50 ng/ml, but achieved a similar percentage reduction by 60 min (Fig. 4, A versus B). Additionally, following the first and the second GH applications at 500 ng/ml, the GH-induced reduction of GHR resulted in lines that were parallel to each other (Fig. 4, A andB) suggesting that the rate of loss of GHR was determined by the concentration of GH in the media, regardless of initial levels of GHR. Finally, when the same experiments were evaluated for JAK2 protein levels, they remained approximately constant (Fig. 3, row 2).Figure 4Levels of GHR following GH pretreatment at 50 or 500 ng/ml plus a 3-h wash-out period. A andB, densitometric analysis of the Western blots from three experiments similar to those in Fig. 3, row 1, using 500 ng/ml bGH, and from similar experiments using a different dose (50 ng/ml bGH) were performed. The data are expressed as means ± S.E. The GHR levels in untreated samples were arbitrarily set to 100%. GH1 (solid line), first GH exposure; GH2 (dashed line), second exposure to GH (at the same concentration and the times indicated) following the 1-h first exposure and 3 h in GH-free, serum-free media.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because repeated applications of GH are capable of activating multiple cycles of STAT5 phosphorylation in vivo, we studied whether GH-induced changes in the levels of GHR affected the ability of a second exposure of GH to induce PY-STAT5. Following a 1-h exposure to 500 ng/ml bGH followed by a 3-h incubation in GH-free, serum-free medium, PY-STAT5 levels returned to basal (Fig. 3, row 3, lane 7 versus lane 6). The second application of 500 ng/ml bGH for 5 min induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of STAT5 to ∼60% of that induced by 5 min bGH alone (Figs. 3 (row 3) and 5). The decreased ability of the second bGH exposure to induce PY-STAT5 compared with the first bGH was evident at all bGH concentrations tested (500 ng/ml shown in Fig. 5 ;data not shown for 50, 100 and 200 ng/ml bGH). Even though there was a reduced maximal effect of the second exposure to bGH on PY-STAT5, there were similar kinetics of bGH-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of STAT5 and PY-STAT5 dephosphorylation for both exposures to GH (Fig. 5). This suggests no significant changes in the activity of a phosphatase to dephosphorylate STAT5B between the first and the second exposure to GH. The same cell extracts were analyzed for changes in protein levels and mobility of STAT5B. The STAT5B protein normally appeared as a doublet in the Western blot because of serine phosphorylation of STAT5B resulting in retarded mobility (Fig. 3, row 4) (23Gebert C.A. Park S.H. Waxman D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 400-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). GH-induced STAT5B activation is associated with dual phosphorylation of STAT5B at both serine and tyrosine residues, resulting in a third band (highest band) with the slowest mobility and a loss of the lowest band (23Gebert C.A. Park S.H. Waxman D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 400-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Following the first bGH treatment, the intensity of the highest band became greater than that of the second band; by 3 h following GH removal, STAT5B had been dephosphorylated and had returned to the basal state (Fig. 3,row 4). Consistent with the PY-STAT5 data, following the second GH exposure for 5–60 min, the intensity of the highest band was approximately equal to or only slightly greater than that of the second band (Fig. 3, row 4) instead of the preponderance of the highest (tyrosyl-phosphorylated STAT5B) band following the initial GH application. This implies, by measurement of gel retardation, a lesser ability of GH to induce phosphorylation of STAT5B following the second versus the first GH exposure, similar to the lesser induction of PY-STAT5 as measured by phosphorylation-specific antibodies. Total STAT5B protein levels were the same or increased, and certainly not decreased, following the second versus the first GH exposure (Fig. 3, row 4). Thus, the lower GH-induced PY-STAT5 resulting from the second versus the first GH exposure could not be explained by loss of STAT5B protein. When H4 cells were treated with bGH (500 ng/ml) for 1 h, the bGH was washed away, and the cells were incubated in GH-free, serum-free media for various time intervals, there was a recovery of both GHR levels and the ability of GH to induce PY-STAT5. As described previously, GHR levels were reduced to ∼20–30% of the control levels following 1 h of bGH treatment (Fig.2 B). Following a 1-h interval in GH-free, serum-free media, GHR levels increased negligibly and were ∼30% of that in untreated cells (Fig. 6 B). Following 2, 3, 6, and 16 h in GH-free, serum-free media, the cellular levels of GHR recovered to ∼40, 60, 80, and 100%, respectively, of that in cells not treated with GH (Fig. 6 B). There was little remaining PY-STAT5 after 1 h of GH followed by 1 h in GH-free, serum-free media, and phosphorylation of STAT5 could still be induced by 20 min of GH, but only to ∼20% of that induced by 20 min of GH without GH pretreatment and washing (Fig. 6,A and B). The ability of GH for 20 min to induce PY-STAT5 increased with increasing times of GH-free, serum-free incubation. Following 2, 3, 6, and 16 h, the abilit"

Sticky DNA is a polypurine·polypurine· polypyrimidine (R·R·Y) triplex; hence, the features must include a mirror repeat sequence. However, the role of the distribution of purines and pyrimidines on the complementary strands has not been explored. Also, because a (GAAGGA·TCCTTC)65 tract is present in the same intron, the significance of the DNA sequence on triplex and sticky DNA formation may have further relevance. At present, the function of this unusual repeating hexanucleotide tract is unclear, especially because it does not track through family pedigrees with the disease or inhibit transcription (2Sakamoto N.

Studies were conducted on a family of seven periodically substituted inserts (all ∼130 repeats in length) which contain 0, 4, 7, 8, 11, 20, or 50% substitution of GAA·TTC with GGA·TCC triplets. A relatively small amount of substitution (less than 11%) caused no inhibitory effects. However, higher levels of GGA·TCC interruptions reduced the formation of sticky DNA, alleviated transcription inhibition, and reduced genetic instabilities. We wished to further our studies with long DNA tracts with uniformly repeating polypurine·pyrimidine sequence motifs such as GA·TC, GGA·TCC, and GAAGGA·TCCTTC. Herein, we have evaluated the capacity of related types of long repeating R·Y sequences to form the sticky DNA structure, including GA·TC, GGA·TCC, and GAAGGA·TCCTTC. Also, the ability of the FRDA GAA·TTC repeat to interact with each of these three repeat sequences was determined. These results provide important confirmatory evidence on the R·R·Y conformation of sticky DNA and give insights into possible DNA loop interactions in FRDA chromosomes.

Furthermore, studies on a family of mutated GAA·TTC repeat tracts in plasmids containing various amount of GGA·TCC interruptions (ranging from 4 to 50%) revealed that GAA·TTC repeats with less than 20% interruptions form triplexes and/or sticky DNA similar to the uninterrupted repeat sequence (10Sakamoto N.

To investigate further the sequence requirements for the formation of sticky DNA, we constructed and characterized families of recombinant plasmids containing all purines on one strand and all pyrimidines on the complementary strands of the inserts. (GA·TC)n (where n = 10, 20, and 37) as well as (GGA·TCC)n (wheren = 16, 30, 42, 53, and 74) were prepared. Investigations were also conducted on a plasmid containing a 2.5-kbp R·Y tract that is present in intron 21 of the polycystic kidney disease 1 (PKD1) gene (14Bacolla A. Jaworski A. Connors T.D. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18597-18604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This sequence contains 23 perfect mirror repeats that can form DNA triplexes with stems of at least 10 bp and are clustered into three distinct regions of the 2.5-kbp tract. More than a thousand perfect tandem repeats, which will form slipped structures (18), are present. The dinucleotides TC and CT are the most common; however, they are excluded from the 5′-end where the mirror repeats predominate. The trinucleotide repeats are mostly CCT and are localized within one end of the tract. Pentanucleotide repeats include CTCCC, CTCCT, and CCCAT. These pentanucleotide repeats are also clustered within the R·Y tract. In summary, thisPKD1 sequence shows the presence of many mirror and direct repeats that are localized within the sequence. This tract contains the highest density of unorthodox simple sequence repeat features (mirror, direct repeats, and R·Y strand bias) of any known sequence of this length (14Bacolla A. Jaworski A. Connors T.D. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18597-18604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To analyze the sequence requirements of the R·Y region for sticky DNA formation in the dimeric form, we isolated dimers from plasmid preparations grown in E. coli SURE cells. The accompanying paper (1Vetcher A.A. Napierala M. Iyer R. Chastain P.D. Griffith J.D. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39217-39227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) demonstrates that only dimeric and higher oligomeric, but not monomeric, forms of the plasmids will form sticky DNA. Thus, it was concluded (1Vetcher A.A. Napierala M. Iyer R. Chastain P.D. Griffith J.D. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39217-39227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) that two long tracts of R·Y must be present in one plasmid to generate sticky DNA. The plasmid monomeric forms of uninterrupted as well as periodically interrupted long GAA·TTC repeats will not form sticky DNA (1Vetcher A.A. Napierala M. Iyer R. Chastain P.D. Griffith J.D. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39217-39227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Also, we would have liked to investigate the behaviors of long homopolymeric tracts of A·T as well as G·C. However, these investigations are precluded by the extreme genetic instability of these simple sequences (19Klein R.D. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12954-12961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Klein R.D. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12962-12969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies were conducted to evaluate the capacity of the sequences described above and listed in Table I to form sticky DNA. Fig.1 A shows the generic structure of a biological dimer, obviously containing two identical tracts of the repeating sequences. The repeats were dinucleotide or trinucleotide or hexanucleotide or 2.5-kb R·Y tracts. Fig. 1 B shows the gel electrophoretic analyses for the GA·TC tract; Fig. 1 C shows the electrophoretic analysis for the GGA·TCC tracts, and Dpresents the control data for (GAA·TTC)150 and a similar length of the repeating hexanucleotide sequence (pMP193). The dimers of pUC9-derived plasmids harboring GA·TC tracts revealed the formation of sticky DNA for pGA37 which contains 37 dimeric repeats; however, little or no sticky DNA was observed for the plasmids containing the two shorter dinucleotide repeat tracts (10 and 20 units in length) (Fig. 1 and Table I). Unfortunately, longer repeat tracts of GA·TC were not available for investigation. Thus, repeating dinucleotide sequences containing all purines on one strand and all pyrimidines on the complementary strand can also form sticky DNA. Studies were also conducted on the repeating trinucleotide sequence, GGA·TCC, containing 16–74 triplet repeats. This sequence contains 66% GC, whereas the FRDA mutation contains only 33% GC. Interestingly, the three plasmids (pUC19 derivatives) which contain 42–74 repeats readily formed sticky DNA, whereas the two shorter inserts did not have this capability (Fig. 1 and Table I). Hence, the threshold length for sticky DNA formation is between 40 and 74 bp for GA·TC, 90 and 126 bp for GGA·TCC, and 99 and 177 bp for GAA·TTC. No hereditary neurological diseases have been identified yet where GGA·TCC is involved in its etiology (18). A R·Y sequence containing an irregular distribution of A and G nucleotides in the polypurine strain was investigated to evaluate the necessity of a repetitive sequence. The 2.5-kbp tract from intron 21 of the PKD1 gene was employed because of its known sequence features (for review, see Ref. 14Bacolla A. Jaworski A. Connors T.D. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18597-18604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) as well as its interesting biological characteristics. This 2.5-kbp sequence contains four P1 nuclease-sensitive regions (18), which apparently form triplexes (14Bacolla A. Jaworski A. Connors T.D. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18597-18604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar,18). One of these regions contains a 404-bp noninterrupted R·Y tract (13Van Raay T.J. Burn T.C. Connors T.D. Petri L.R. Germino G.G. Klinger K.W. Landes G.M. Microb. Comp. Genomics. 1996; 1: 317-327PubMed Google Scholar). Because this length is approximately twice the known threshold (described above) for the formation of sticky DNA for GAA·TTC as well as GGA·TCC, we felt that it might be possible for thisPKD1 insert to adopt a sticky DNA structure. However, as revealed in Table I, no RB was found. Because this 404-bp R·Y tract contains no mirror repeats with at least 80% matching triple base interactions (13Van Raay T.J. Burn T.C. Connors T.D. Petri L.R. Germino G.G. Klinger K.W. Landes G.M. Microb. Comp. Genomics. 1996; 1: 317-327PubMed Google Scholar, 14Bacolla A. Jaworski A. Connors T.D. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18597-18604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) that are longer than ∼200 bp, this result is not unexpected. Further gel electrophoretic analyses revealed that the RB found with GA·TC as well as with GGA·TCC inserts were, in fact, sticky DNA, by evaluating the lengths of the arms in the X-shaped structures formed after cleavage at different unique restriction sites. For the pUC19 derivatives, the DNAs were linearized with Eco0109I,EcoRI or NdeI and for pUC9 derivatives, the plasmids were cleaved with EcoRI or HindIII. In all cases, the correlation described earlier (2Sakamoto N. Chastain P.D. Parniewski P. Ohshima K. Pandolfo M. Griffith J.D. Wells R.D. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 465-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) between the extent of retardation of the RB and the distance between the restriction enzyme cleavage site and the R·Y tract was observed (data not shown). Further investigations on the role of DNA sequence on the capacity of two tracts of different types of R·Y sequences to form sticky DNA were conducted. Plasmids containing one tract of (GAAGGA·TCCTTC)65 and another block of (GAA·TTC)176 were prepared and characterized (Fig. 2). Similar plasmids were also prepared in which the (GAA·TTC)176 was replaced with (GAA·TTC)80. Plasmids were characterized which contained the inserts in the direct repeat orientations as well as in the inverted repeat orientations (Fig. 2). Prior investigations (1Vetcher A.A. Napierala M. Iyer R. Chastain P.D. Griffith J.D. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39217-39227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) revealed that only plasmids containing inserts in the direct repeat orientation could form sticky DNA, and our current work confirms this conclusion (TableII).Table IIAmount of RB formed from plasmids harboring two inserts as a function of repeating sequence orientations and the length of the (GAA·TTC)n tractPlasmidOrientation of (GAAGGA·TCCTTC)65Orientation of (GAA·TTC)nnRB formation%pRW4886NAaNA, not applicable.NA176100pRW4887NANA1760pRW5000II17689pRW5001II8053pRW5002III1760pRW5003III800pRW5004IIII17688pRW5005III1760a NA, not applicable. Open table in a new tab Table II reveals that pRW4886, which contains two tracts of 176 repeats of GAA·TTC in the direct repeat orientation (Fig. 2), readily forms sticky DNA (as described under “Experimental Procedures”). However, pRW4887, containing the same inserts but in the inverted repeat orientation (Fig. 2), were devoid of this capability, as expected (1Vetcher A.A. Napierala M. Iyer R. Chastain P.D. Griffith J.D. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39217-39227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Interestingly, pRW5000 and pRW5004 readily formed sticky DNA; these plasmids contain one tract of (GAAGGA· TCCTTC)65 and one tract of (GAA·TTC)176; both inserts in the two plasmids are in the direct repeat orientation, but the pair of repeats are inverted in pRW5004 compared with pRW5000. Accordingly, it is apparent that the GGAGAA tract from the repeating hexanucleotide sequence is aligning and Hoogsteen pairing in an antiparallel manner with the GAAGAA sequence from the repeating triplet sequence. Thus, five of six (83%) of the base oppositions are “normal” G·G·A and A·A·T structures with only one G·A·T opposition that is less stable (10Sakamoto N. Larson J.E. Iyer R.R. Montermini L. Pandolfo M. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27178-27187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, by our previous analysis (Table II of Ref.1Vetcher A.A. Napierala M. Iyer R. Chastain P.D. Griffith J.D. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39217-39227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), this extent (17%) of “misoppositions” should be tolerated. However, the investigations described above (Table I) in which two tracts of the (GAAGGA·TCCTTC)65 would be required to pair successfully to form sticky DNA was forbidden; this result is as expected (1Vetcher A.A. Napierala M. Iyer R. Chastain P.D. Griffith J.D. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39217-39227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) because only four of six (66%) of the correct oppositions would be present, which is insufficient to stabilize sticky DNA (1Vetcher A.A. Napierala M. Iyer R. Chastain P.D. Griffith J.D. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39217-39227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar,10Sakamoto N. Larson J.E. Iyer R.R. Montermini L. Pandolfo M. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27178-27187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As expected, pRW5001 also forms sticky DNA, and thus a (GAA·TTC)80 tract can replace the 176-mer and still effectively pair with the repeating hexamer. Also, all plasmids with inserts in the inverted orientation (pRW4887, 5002, 5003, and 5005) were incapable of adopting the sticky structure (1Vetcher A.A. Napierala M. Iyer R. Chastain P.D. Griffith J.D. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39217-39227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The effect of the length of the pBR322 DNA sequence between two tracts of (GAA·TTC)60 was investigated to evaluate further the factors involved in the stabilization of sticky DNA. For the plasmids shown in Fig. 1 as well as Fig. 2, the repeat sequences were separated by more than 2,000 bp. To evaluate whether one very long GAA·TTC tract could fold back on itself to form sticky DNA and/or to determine the influence of a very short intervening sequence, we prepared and characterized pRW4881 (Fig.3), which contains 88 bp of human FRDA flanking sequence between a pair of (GAA·TTC)60sequences. The plasmid has two cleavage sites for BssHII, which are separated by a (GAA·TTC)60 tract. After cleavage of pRW4881 with BssHII and electrophoretic analysis for sticky DNA (Fig. 3), RB is found. The extent of retardation is as expected because the location of the cleavage sites is close to the (GAA·TTC)60 tract (2Sakamoto N. Chastain P.D. Parniewski P. Ohshima K. Pandolfo M. Griffith J.D. Wells R.D. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 465-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Thus, the stabilizing forces for sticky DNA generated by the fold-back of two GAA·TTC sequences that are proximal are sufficiently great to enable the formation of sticky DNA. Sharp bending of the 88-bp intervening sequence must have been caused by the stabilization and pairing of the GAA·TTC tracts. Because this 88 bp is shorter than the known persistence length of DNA, which is 450 Å or 130 bp (21Gray Jr., H.B. Hearst J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 35: 111-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 22Hearst J.E. Stockmayer W.H. J. Chem. Phys. 1962; 37: 1425-1433Crossref Scopus (282) Google Scholar), we conclude that the interactive forces created by the pair of GAA·TTC tracts must be substantial. Sticky DNA was described (2Sakamoto N. Chastain P.D. Parniewski P. Ohshima K. Pandolfo M. Griffith J.D. Wells R.D. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 465-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 9Sakamoto N. Ohshima K. Montermini L. Pandolfo M. Wells R.D. J. Biol.

The lengths of GAA·TTC required for its formation correspond to the tracts found in intron 1 of the frataxin gene of FRDA patients (2Sakamoto N. Chastain P.D. Parniewski P. Ohshima K. Pandolfo M. Griffith J.D. Wells R.D. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 465-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Sticky DNA was stabilized by negative supercoiling as well as divalent metal ions. The long GAA·TTC repeats form R·R·Y triplexes at neutral pH (23Le Doan T. Perrouault L. Praseuth D. Habhoub N. Decout J.L. Thuong N.T. Lhomme J. Helene C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7749-7760Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). The companion article (1Vetcher A.A. Napierala M. Iyer R. Chastain P.D. Griffith J.D. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39217-39227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) demonstrates the necessity of two tracts of GAA·TTC in one molecule for the intramolecular formation of sticky DNA. Interestingly, a tract of (GAAGGA·TCCTTC)65 is also present in intron 1 of the frataxin gene (8Ohshima K. Sakamoto N. Labuda M. Poirier J. Moseley M.L. Montermini L. Ranum L.P. Wells R.D. Pandolfo M.

Ohshima K. Montermini L. Pandolfo M. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27171-27177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We have evaluated some of the sequence requirements for the mirror repeat R·Y insert tracts to form sticky DNA. The following R·Y tracts were investigated: GA·TC, GAA·TTC, GGA·TCC, GAAGGA·TCCTTC, and the 2.5-kbp R·Y tract from intron 21 of the polycystic kidney disease gene 1. The GA·TC repeat sequence is distributed widely in a variety of genomes (24Toth G. Gaspari Z. Jurka J. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 967-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). However, expanded repeats of GGA·TCC have not been discovered to date in conjunction with a hereditary neurological disease (18). In plasmids containing a pair of tracts of the identical repeat sequences, we found that sufficiently long tracts of GA·TC, GGA·TCC, and GAA·TTC adopted the sticky conformation. Alternatively, neither the GAAGGA·TCCTTC repeating hexanucleotide sequence nor the 2.5-kbp R·Y tract from the PKD1 gene adopted this unusual conformation. Because the two purine strands in the R·R·Y complex must be antiparallel (23Le Doan T. Perrouault L. Praseuth D. Habhoub N. Decout J.L. Thuong N.T. Lhomme J. Helene C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7749-7760Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), these results are readily explained from the known types of Hoogsteen bp schemes shown in Fig. 4; T·A·A and C·G·G are quite stable and favored structures, whereas T·A·G, C·G·A, and C·G·A+ are less favored. Accordingly, Fig.5 I demonstrates the facile triplex formation for GA·TC as well as GAA·TTC and Fig.5 II shows the stable bp interactions for GGA·TCC repeats.Figure 5Model of the possible triad interactions in all frames for the formation of sticky DNA.

Obviously, the same pairing rules hold for the pairing of the R strand of GAA·TTC with the Watson-Crick duplex of GAAGGA·TCCTTC.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Alternatively, Fig. 5 III shows that for GAAGGA·TCCTTC interacting with the identical sequence in an intramolecular reaction, only four of six (66%) of the triple base oppositions are stable, even in the optimal frame. This figure shows the potential pairing schemes in all six frames. Thus, this degree of stability is insufficient for the formation of sticky DNA (10Sakamoto N. Larson J.E. Iyer R.R. Montermini L. Pandolfo M. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27178-27187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and provides a rational basis for the negative results shown in Table I for this sequence. Studies were also conducted with plasmids containing GAAGGA·TCCTTC and GAA·TTC in the same plasmid in direct repeat orientations. These plasmids showed the formation of sticky DNA. Fig. 5 IV shows that in the proper frames (a and d), five of six of the pairs are in stable Hoogsteen structures (Fig. 4 A). This extent of pairing is sufficient to enable the formation of a stable triplex (10Sakamoto N. Larson J.E. Iyer R.R. Montermini L. Pandolfo M. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27178-27187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Also, as expected, when two tracts of GAA·TTC are present in the same plasmid (pRW4886) (Fig. 2), a stable sticky DNA structure was observed. In summary, the composite results demonstrate that the formation of sticky DNA requires the formation of at least 83% of acceptable Hoogsteen and Watson-Crick base oppositions. Accordingly, these data provide strong confirmatory evidence for the purine-purine antiparallel triplex structures proposed in Figs. 4 and5. Furthermore, our current results are in excellent agreement with prior studies (1Vetcher A.A. Napierala M. Iyer R. Chastain P.D. Griffith J.D. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39217-39227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), which showed that sticky DNA was an R·R·Y triplex with the purine strands in the antiparallel orientation. This investigation (1Vetcher A.A. Napierala M. Iyer R. Chastain P.D. Griffith J.D. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39217-39227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) with a family of inserts in recombinant plasmid dimers with varying extents of interruptions between the extremes of pure GAA·TTC repeats (0% of GGA·TCC in the GAA·TTC repeats) and the repeating hexanucleotide sequence GAAGGA·TCCTTC (50% of GGA·TCC in the GAA·TTC repeats) revealed that more than 20% interruptions by GGA·TCC in the GAA·TTC repeat sequence abolished the formation of sticky DNA. In summary, all of these results considered together provide important confirmatory evidence for sticky DNA as an R·R·Y triplex with the base pairing schemes shown in Fig. 4 A with the two purine strands in the antiparallel arrangement. The salient features of FRDA as well as its human and molecular genetic properties were reviewed in the Introduction to the companion paper (1Vetcher A.A. Napierala M. Iyer R. Chastain P.D. Griffith J.D. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39217-39227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In patients, the expanded GAA·TTC repeats (66–1,700 or more) may form sticky DNA and thereby inhibit transcription; prior investigations (9Sakamoto N. Ohshima K. Montermini L. Pandolfo M. Wells R.D.

The first intron of the frataxin gene also contains a (GAAGGA·TCCTTC)65 tract, which is nonpathogenic (8Ohshima K. Sakamoto N. Labuda M. Poirier J. Moseley M.L. Montermini L. Ranum L.P. Wells R.D. Pandolfo M. Neurology. 1999; 53: 1854-1857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the GAA·TTC repeat, this hexamer repeat does not form an antiparallel triplex and/or sticky DNA, does not inhibit transcription, and does not associate with the FRDA disease state (8Ohshima K.

Because our investigations demonstrated the facility of formation of sticky DNA between long tracts of GAA·TTC and this neighboring hexanucleotide repeat, it is possible that these two sequences interact to form a potent block for transcription in FRDA patients.

One is to act as a site where DNA replication is controlled so that it occurs only once per cell cycle. The second is to serve as a locus where the replication fork machinery is assembled, involving a series of orchestrated steps. An important event at oriC is the binding of DnaA protein to specific sequences named DnaA boxes (3Fuller R.S. Funnell B.E. Kornberg A. Cell. 1984; 38: 889-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). A second essential step in the assembly process is the DnaA-dependent recruitment of DnaB (4Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Sutton M.D. Carr K.M. Vicente M. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34255-34262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Studies on the native structure of DnaB have firmly established that it is a hexamer of identical subunits arranged as a toroidal structure with a central opening (6Reha K.L. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4043-4050PubMed Google Scholar, 7Arai K. Yasuda S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5247-5252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Turner J. Hingorani M.M. Kelman Z.

Its stability requires the presence of Mg2+ ion; removal of the metal ion by dialysis or chelation is needed to dissociate the DnaB hexamer into its subassemblies (10Bujalowski W. Klonowska M.M. Jezewska M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31350-31358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the form of DnaB that is required at the stage of initiation at oriC is as a complex with its partner, DnaC (11Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2463-2468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2469-2475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assembly of this complex requires the binding of ATP to DnaC, with the nucleotide serving to alter the conformation of an N-terminal domain of DnaC so that it can bind to DnaB (13Ludlam A.V. McNatt M.W. Carr K.M. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27345-27353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Each DnaC monomer is present at a 1:1 ratio with each DnaB protomer (14Wickner S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 921-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 15Lanka E.

Chem. 1982; 257: 13770-13775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas it is the DnaB-DnaC complex that is active at the stage of initiation, DnaB liberated from DnaC is active during DNA synthesis. The association of DnaC with DnaB inhibits the enzymatic activities of this essential helicase, and the hydrolysis of ATP bound to DnaC is required to release DnaC from DnaB (5Sutton M.D. Carr K.M. Vicente M. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34255-34262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 12Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol.

Once DnaB is situated at the apex of the replication fork, the helicase acts to unwind the parental DNA as each DNA strand is copied by DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. These events are facilitated by a functional coupling, involving an interaction between DnaB as it moves in the 5′-to-3′ direction on the lagging strand template and the tau subunit of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (18Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 643-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). When this physical interaction is maintained, DnaB moves at a 20-fold faster rate than the speed of DnaB translocation alone. At oriC, it has been proposed that an AT-rich region unwound by DnaA protein serves as the entry site for DnaB (19Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1988; 52: 743-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Footprinting studies map DnaB to this region, in support of the model (20Fang L. Davey M.J. O'Donnell M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 541-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Other results indicate that only two DnaB hexamers are bound atoriC (20Fang L. Davey M.J. O'Donnell M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 541-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 21Carr K.M. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44919-44925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because DnaA induces a limited degree of unwinding, one model is that only two DnaB hexamers can bind because the available single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)1 is only sufficient for one DnaB hexamer for each DNA strand. We have relied on a simple replication system to study the process of recruitment of DnaB onto DNA and to address the question of whether the availability of ssDNA influences the number of helicase molecules that can bind. With a single-stranded DNA carrying a DnaA box in a hairpin structure (M13 A-site), DnaA bound to this site forms a structure that in turn is recognized by the DnaB-DnaC complex to form an intermediate termed the prepriming complex (5Sutton M.D. Carr K.M. Vicente M. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34255-34262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 22Masai H. Nomura N. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15134-15144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following the release of DnaC, DnaB is then free to move on the ssDNA. The transient binding of primase to DnaB results in primers that are formed at apparently random locations (23Lu Y.B. Ratnakar P.V. Mohanty B.K. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12902-12907Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar,24Chang P. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26187-26195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These primers are then extended by DNA polymerase holoenzyme in conversion of the ssDNA to duplex form. In this system, DNA replication is dependent on a single DnaA box-containing sequence, and only one DNA strand is synthesized on the ssDNA template. By comparison, DNA replication from oriC is more complicated because a duplex DNA is involved, and each parental DNA strand is bound by DnaB to support bidirectional replication fork movement. Priming and DNA synthesis occur on both strands of the parental duplex. In this report, we sought to characterize further the molecular composition of the complex formed by the binding of DnaA, DnaB, and DnaC protein to the ssDNA carrying the DnaA box hairpin. The major objective was to test the model that the amount of ssDNA available influences the number of DnaB molecules that can bind. Several independent methods were used. In the first, a 379-nucleotide-long ssDNA bearing the DnaA box hairpin and covered by SSB was used to demonstrate the binding of DnaA in gel mobility shift assays. The second involved a primer extension assay to demonstrate the binding and positions of these proteins to the DnaA box hairpin. In the third approach, we used immunoblot analysis to determine the ratio of DnaA, DnaB, and DnaC protein assembled on the ssDNA. These results show that DnaA protein bound to the DnaA box hairpin recruits only a single DnaB hexamer and strongly suggest that the availability of ssDNA is not a limiting factor in the loading of DnaB onto DNA. M13 A-site ssDNA (25Nomura N. Masai H. Inuzuka M. Miyazaki C. Ohtsubo E. Itoh T. Sasamoto S. Matsui M. Ishizaki R. Arai K. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), purified proteins, and antibodies have been described previously (4Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19334-19340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). M13 −40 universal primer (17-mer) and ATPγS were from U.S. Biochemical Corp. The large fragment of DNA polymerase I was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit were from Bio-Rad. Oligonucleotides (GCGGATAACAATTTCACAC and CAGTGCCAAGCTTGGCTGCAG) were synthesized by a campus facility and were used to PCR-amplify the region containing the DnaA box hairpin. These primers are derived from M13mp8, the DNA vector used to construct M13 A-site. After PCR amplification, the product was digested with HindIII endonuclease that cleaves within the latter primer and then end-filled at this restriction site with [α-32P]dATP and the large fragment of DNA polymerase I to label specifically the viral strand ssDNA fragment. In Fig.1 B, the primer corresponding to the viral strand was first radiolabeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, and then the unincorporated label was removed by passing the sample over a Sephadex G25 spin column before PCR amplification. The PCR-amplified DNA was then combined with a 3-fold molar excess of M13 A-site ssDNA in 1× SSC, placed in a water bath at 100 °C, and allowed to cool gradually to room temperature to anneal the PCR-amplified DNA strand that is complementary to the M13 A-site viral ssDNA. The DNA of viral strand sense remains single-stranded. The sample was then electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel in buffer containing 90 mm Tris borate, pH 8.9, and 1 mm EDTA. The 379-nucleotide-long ssDNA carrying the DnaA box hairpin was then isolated from a gel slice (QiaQuick spin column; Qiagen). The identity of the isolated ssDNA fragment was confirmed by use of strand-specific oligonucleotides that annealed to both the isolated ssDNA fragment and the viral M13 A-site ssDNA. As a negative control, an oligonucleotide of the same sense as the viral strand did not anneal to either the isolated ssDNA fragment or the viral M13 A-site ssDNA. The concentration of the isolated ssDNA fragment was determined by specific radioactivity and by agarose gel electrophoresis and staining with ethidium bromide relative to known amounts of a DNA fragment of similar size. Reactions (10 μl) contained 5.8 fmol of 32P-labeled ssDNA fragment bearing the DnaA box hairpin (379 nucleotides long) in ABC Buffer (40 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 40 mm potassium glutamate, 4% (w/v) sucrose, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2 mm dithiothreitol), SSB, DnaA, and ATP as indicated. Reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min and then analyzed by native gel electrophoresis. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (4%, 38:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) was in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.38 mglycine, 8 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA as described (27Sun W. Godson G.N. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6701-6705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gels (13 cm, 11 cm, 1.5 mm) were run in this buffer at 60–70 V for 6–7 h or at 30 V for 14 h and then were dried and autoradiographed. Reactions (25 μl) contained M13 A-site ssDNA annealed to the −40 universal primer (50 ng), SSB (1 μg), DnaA (45 ng), DnaB (50 ng), and DnaC (25 ng) as indicated and ATPγS (0.1 mm) as indicated in ABC Buffer. After incubation for 10 min at 30 °C, deoxynucleotides (50 μm each including [α-32P]dCTP, 400 cpm/pmol of total nucleotide) and the large fragment of DNA polymerase I (2 units) were added, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 5 min. Samples were denatured in a boiling water bath and then electrophoretically separated on a sequencing gel followed by autoradiography to visualize the extension products. DNA sequencing reactions by the dideoxy chain terminating method with the singly primed M13 A-site template described above provided molecular weight markers to map the 3′-ends of the primer extension products. Reactions of prepriming complex formation (100 μl), a 50-fold scale up of a standard replication reaction in terms of DNA and replication protein components, contained M13 A-site ssDNA (5 μg), SSB (30 μg), DnaA (2.8 μg), DnaB (10 μg), and DnaC (5 μg) as indicated in ABC Buffer supplemented with 0.1 mm ATP or 0.1 mmATPγS. After incubation at 25 °C for 10 min, samples were applied onto gel filtration columns (Sepharose 4B, 0.7 × 13 cm; AmershamBiosciences) equilibrated in ABC Buffer supplemented with 0.1 mm ATP or 0.1 mm ATPγS, as indicated. Fractions of 200 μl were collected, and the isolated prepriming complexes were analyzed by quantitative immunoblotting. Fractions from gel filtration chromatography were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to identify void volume fractions containing M13 A-site ssDNA and, where indicated, to quantitate the amount of DNA by comparison with known amounts of M13 A-site ssDNA that was co-electrophoresed and used to prepare a standard curve. The ethidium bromide-stained gels were photographed and analyzed with an Eastman Kodak Co. EDAS 120 gel documentation system. To quantitate the amounts of the respective proteins bound to the ssDNA, samples were electrophoretically separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (BA-85; Schleicher and Schuell) alongside known amounts of the respective purified protein to prepare a standard curve. The blots were probed with either M43 monoclonal antibody for DnaA (28Marszalek J. Zhang W. Hupp T.R. Margulies C. Carr K.M. Cherry S. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18535-18542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) or a combination of affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies for DnaB and DnaC. Chemiluminescence (SuperSignal; Pierce) of immune complexes of horseradish peroxidase conjugated to the secondary antibody was analyzed with a Bio-Rad model GS505 molecular imager and associated software. Previous studies indicate that DnaA protein recognizes and binds to a DnaA box sequence in a putative hairpin structure, as indicated by footprinting studies with DNase I and dimethyl sulfate and by mutational analysis of the DnaA box hairpin (22Masai H. Nomura N. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15134-15144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm these observations, we developed assay conditions to measure the binding of DnaA protein to a 379-nucleotide-long ssDNA fragment carrying the DnaA box hairpin. Because prepriming complex formation occurs on an ssDNA covered by SSB, the amount of SSB needed to saturate the DNA was first explored. The binding site size for SSB is 65 ± 3 nucleotides at the moderate ionic strength used in this experiment (29Lohman T.M. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6167-6176Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 30Overman L.B. Bujalowski W. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 456-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 31Bujalowski W. Lohman T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and recent studies confirm that the ssDNA wraps around the SSB tetramer, with each dimer capable of binding an oligonucleotide of 35 residues (32Kozlov A.G. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6032-6044Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The hairpin of 62 bases is stable in the presence of SSB because it remains sensitive to DNase I cleavage (22Masai H. Nomura N. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15134-15144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The left arm of 110 nucleotides can accommodate two tetramers, with one tetramer bound to 65 nucleotides and the second tetramer bound to 35 nucleotides via one of its dimers. The right arm of 207 nucleotides is long enough to be bound by three SSB tetramers. Our observation of five complexes with increasing SSB is consistent with these expectations. Once conditions established the level of SSB that was saturating for this ssDNA fragment, the effect of DnaA on the mobility of the SSB-ssDNA complex was examined. At the highest levels of DnaA, a single, more slowly migrating complex was detected (Fig.1 B). Complexes of intermediate mobility were not observed. As described below, 2–4 DnaA monomers are bound to the DnaA box hairpin. Thus, binding of DnaA to this sequence appears to be concerted because only a single shifted complex was observed. It is noteworthy that in this replication system, the level of SSB is not critical as long as it is at or above the level needed to cover the ssDNA (data not shown). The conclusion from this set of experiments is that DnaA is able to bind to the hairpin structure (as will be shown below also) to form a single discrete complex despite the abundant presence of SSB. Experiments were also performed to measure the binding of DnaA to the ssDNA fragment without SSB or at subsaturating SSB (data not shown). Under either condition, DnaA did not form discrete complexes but bound nonspecifically to the ssDNA fragment based on the formation of complexes that migrated as a smear. This was observed only at the highest levels tested (under reaction conditions as described in Fig.1 B; range of DnaA from 0.09 to 2.8 pmol in increments that varied 2-fold). These results suggest that the binding of SSB to the ssDNA masks sites of nonspecific binding of DnaA. Because of the appearance of discrete SSB-ssDNA complexes at subsaturating SSB, the possibility arises that SSB is not binding randomly and that the stem-loop structure imposes an order in the binding of SSB to the ssDNA. However, Sun and Godson observed the formation of discrete complexes using ssDNA from the lacZcoding region (33Sun W. Godson G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8026-8039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They concluded that SSB did not bind to this DNA in a phased manner from results of in situcopper-phenanthroline footprinting of complexes separated by gel mobility shift. Based on these observations, the several discrete SSB-ssDNA complexes formed at subsaturating SSB are not likely to reflect specific binding of SSB to the ssDNA. An independent approach to measure the binding of DnaA (and other proteins) to the DnaA box hairpin relied on a primer extension assay. In this method, no nuclease was used to generate an end point at which the DNA polymerase terminates DNA synthesis. Instead, the ability of a stably bound protein to hinder progress of the DNA polymerase results in a unique primer extension product. A primer was annealed downstream of the hairpin, and then SSB and the indicated proteins were added to allow binding to the ssDNA before primer extension and detection of the single-stranded DNAs by autoradiography (Fig. 2, lanes 1–5). In all lanes, including the control with no other added protein except SSB, radioactive material was observed that remained at or very near the wells of the sequencing gel. This DNA may have arisen by renaturation of the labeled DNA to the ssDNA template. A population of DNAs in all lanes at a position one-fourth of the way into the gel presumably represents primer extension products due to DNA synthesis well beyond the DnaA box hairpin. With DnaA alone on the SSB-coated ssDNA, an extension product was observed that mapped to within the DnaA box sequence (lane 2, summarized in Fig. 2 B). The additional inclusion of DnaB alone and in combination with DnaC but in the absence of nucleotide (required to form the DnaB-DnaC complex) did not appreciably alter the abundance of this DNA; nor were other new products seen (lanes 3 and 4). Upon inclusion of DnaB and DnaC but with omission of DnaA, this DNA was not observed, so its appearance is dependent on the binding of DnaA to the DnaA box hairpin. In the absence of DnaA, DnaB, and DnaC, no stop sites were observed that we could attribute to the DnaA box hairpin. Apparently, the stem-loop structure itself does not serve as a pause site for the DNA polymerase. The failure to detect terminations due to SSB bound to the ssDNA may indicate that the bound SSB is not an obstacle or that SSB, if bound randomly to the ssDNA, gives rise to primer extension products whose 3′-ends are not at discrete sites. ATPγS was included in one set of reactions (Fig. 2, lanes 6–9), because this analogue supports the formation of the DnaB-DnaC complex but, since it is poorly if at all hydrolyzed, does not support the release of DnaC from DnaB (5Sutton M.D. Carr K.M. Vicente M. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34255-34262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 11Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2463-2468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inclusion of this nucleotide did not affect the abundance of the primer extension product formed by the binding of DnaA to the DnaA box hairpin, nor were other products observed (lane 6 compared withlane 2). Evidently, the stability of DnaA bound to the hairpin is comparable in the presence or absence of ATPγS. Upon further supplementation with the DnaB-DnaC complex (Fig. 2,lane 8), additional terminations were seen (summarized in Fig. 2 B). The appearance of these products required the inclusion of DnaA (compare with Fig. 2, lane 9). The primer extension product that mapped to the 3′-side of the hairpin was 10 nucleotides from the stop site within the DnaA box where DnaA is bound. On the 5′ side of the hairpin, a less abundant primer extension product mapped 10 residues upstream from the nucleotide that is paired to the base where termination occurs due to DnaA binding. As will be described below, evidence indicates that a single DnaB hexamer or a single DnaB-DnaC complex is bound. For a model to account for these termination sites, see “Discussion.” Since DnaA physically interacts with DnaB in the DnaB-DnaC complex in the recruitment of the helicase into the prepriming complex (4Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the primer extension results suggest that the DnaB-DnaC complex is bound directly adjacent to DnaA at the DnaA box. Interestingly, the abundance of the termination product attributed to the binding of DnaA was elevated upon supplementation of the reaction containing DnaA with ATPγS, DnaB, and DnaC (Fig. 2, lane 9 compared with lane 6). As shown below, the presence or absence of DnaB and DnaC did not alter statistically the ratio of DnaA monomers bound to the DnaA box hairpin, so DnaB and DnaC do not stabilize DnaA at this site. One possible explanation for the elevated termination due to the binding of DnaA is that DnaA in the prepriming complex assumes a conformation that impedes movement of the DNA polymerase during primer extension. The results of Fig. 2 support the model of a specific nucleoprotein structure. To determine its molecular composition, quantitative immunoblot analysis of the proteins that form this nucleoprotein complex was performed. As a control, we demonstrated that the assembly of DnaA, DnaB, and DnaC on the ssDNA was specific for the DnaA box hairpin (Fig. 3). The M13 derivative carrying the DnaA box hairpin or wild type M13 was incubated with DnaA, DnaB, DnaC, and SSB. As in Fig. 2, ATPγS was included to support formation of the DnaB-DnaC complex but not the release of DnaC once the complex was bound to the ssDNA (5Sutton M.D. Carr K.M. Vicente M. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34255-34262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 11Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2463-2468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After a period of incubation, proteins bound to each ssDNA were separated from unbound protein by gel filtration chromatography. The fractions obtained were then analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to identify void volume fractions containing the ssDNA. Column fractions were also analyzed by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 3 B, DnaA, DnaB, and DnaC coeluted with the ssDNA carrying the DnaA box sequence. With the ssDNA lacking the DnaA box hairpin, DnaA was not detected in void volume fractions. The low level of DnaB and the level of DnaC that was below detection in these fractions presumably reflect nonspecific binding of the DnaB-DnaC complex to the SSB-coated ssDNA. These results indicate that formation of the prepriming complex is specific for the ssDNA carrying the DnaA box hairpin. Under the conditions described above, prepriming complexes were assembled at the DnaA box hairpin carried in M13 ssDNA, and the nucleoprotein complex was isolated by gel filtration. The isolated prepriming complex was then analyzed by quantitative immunoblotting to determine the amounts of proteins bound (see Fig. 4 for representative examples). The amount of ssDNA in the isolated complex was determined by quantitation of ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels relative to known amounts of DNA that were co-electrophoresed. Replicate experiments were performed in order to analyze the data statistically (Table I).Table IStoichiometry of DnaA, DnaB, and DnaC at the DnaA box hairpinReaction conditionsDnaADnaBDnaCnDnaA, DnaB, DnaC, and 0.1 mm ATPγS3.6 ± 0.84.0 ± 0.93.8 ± 1.63DnaA, DnaB, DnaC, and 0.1 mm ATP2.3 ± 0.54.2 ± 0.8None detected4DnaA and 0.1 mm ATPγS3.9 ± 1.95DnaA and 0.1 mm ATP2.6 ± 1.02The results from replicate experiments under the indicated experimental conditions were averaged to calculate the S.D. for the stoichiometries of DnaA, DnaB, and DnaC protein bound to the ssDNA.

Open table in a new tab The results from replicate experiments under the indicated experimental conditions were averaged to calculate the S.D. for the stoichiometries of DnaA, DnaB, and DnaC protein bound to the ssDNA. The termn refers to the number of replicate experiments under a given condition. Regardless of whether DnaB and DnaC were also included, 2–4 DnaA monomers were bound to the DnaA box hairpin. The stoichiometry of DnaA monomers per ssDNA circle is statistically indistinguishable whether the complexes were assembled and isolated with ATP or ATPγS. When DnaB and DnaC were included under conditions that support formation of the DnaB-DnaC complex, the stoichiometry of 4 ± 0.9 and 4.2 ± 0.8 DnaB monomers bound per ssDNA is consistent with a single hexamer bound in the prepriming complex. The nucleotide analogue ATPγS maintains the association of DnaC with DnaB, because ATP hydrolysis is required for the release of DnaC after DnaB has become stably bound to the ssDNA. The comparable stoichiometries of DnaC and DnaB in the prepriming complex under this condition support the conclusion that a single DnaB6-DnaC6 complex is bound per ssDNA. When the prepriming complex was assembled with ATP instead, the inability to detect DnaC in the isolated complex indicates that DnaC has been released. Conditions for the assembly of the prepriming complex include an incubation step at 20 °C for 10 min followed by isolation of the protein-DNA complex that takes another 10 min. Because the rate of DnaB translocation is estimated at 35 nucleotides/s at 30 °C (18Kim S. Dallmann H.G."

Amino acid sequence comparisons suggest that hypophosphite:2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase (HtxA) is a novel member of the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase enzyme family. To provide experimental support for this hypothesis, HtxA was overproduced in Escherichia coli and purified to apparent homogeneity.

Size exclusion analysis suggests that HtxA is active as a homodimer, and maximal activity is observed at pH 7.0 and at 27 °C.

The biochemistry involving this essential and often limiting nutrient is typically thought to be restricted to the formation and hydrolysis of phosphate esters, in which phosphorus exists in its most oxidized state (P5+). However, the number of microorganisms capable of using reduced phosphorus compounds as the sole source of phosphorus or able to synthesize reduced phosphorus compounds clearly demonstrates that this is not the case (1Casida Jr., L.E. J. Bacteriol. 1960; 80: 237-241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Malacinski G. Konetzka W.A. J. Bacteriol. 1966; 91: 578-582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Tsubota G.

Thompson Jr., G.A. Science. 1970; 168: 989-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although microbial metabolism of reduced phosphorus compounds has been documented in the literature for several decades, it has remained unexplored in any detail on either the biochemical or genetic levels until recently. This is especially true with respect to the microbial oxidation of the reduced Pi compounds, phosphite (P3+) and hypophosphite (P+).Microbial growth on hypophosphite or phosphite as the sole source of phosphorus has been reported in such microorganism as Escherichia coli, Bacillus spp., Pseudomonas fluorescens, Klebsiella aerogenes, andErwinia spp. (2Malacinski G. Konetzka W.A. J. Bacteriol. 1966; 91: 578-582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Metcalf W.W. Wanner B.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 6Adams F.

Microbiol. 1998; 64: 3754-3758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, little is known about the biochemistry of hypophosphite or phosphite oxidation in these organisms. In P. fluorescens, activity of partially purified phosphorus-oxidizing enzyme was demonstrated to be NAD+-dependent and specific for phosphite; however, a more detailed analysis was not completed (10Malacinski G.M. Konetzka W.A. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 93: 1906-1910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, hypophosphite oxidation was detected in cell extracts of Bacillus caldolyticus, which was demonstrated to grow on hypophosphite as the sole source of phosphorus (11Heinen W. Lauwers A.M. Arch. Microbiol. 1974; 95: 267-274Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This enzyme was also partially purified, but nothing is known about the reaction beyond the requirement for NAD+; neither the responsible enzyme nor the mechanism of hypophosphite oxidation was determined.Recently we isolated Pseudomonas stutzeri WM88, an organism with the ability to oxidize hypophosphite and phosphite (12Metcalf W.W. Wolfe R.S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5547-5558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic analysis of hypophosphite and phosphite oxidation in P. stutzeri WM88 led to the identification of two regions of the chromosome involved in utilization of these compounds as the sole phosphorus sources, one region for the oxidation of hypophosphite and the other for phosphite oxidation. Furthermore, these studies showed that the genes involved in phosphite oxidation were also required for growth on hypophosphite, suggesting that hypophosphite oxidation to phosphate proceeds via a phosphite intermediate. Sequence analysis of the chromosomal region for hypophosphite oxidation revealed five open reading frames, htxABCDE, which appear to form a transcriptional unit. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of the htxA gene product indicates that it is most similar to members of the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family, having 26% identity to proline 4-hydroxylase fromDactylosporangium (13Shibasaki T. Mori H. Chiba S. Ozaki A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 4028-4031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The putative htxBCDEproducts likely comprise a binding protein-dependent hypophosphite transporter. Of the five open reading frames identified, only the htxA gene was required for hypophosphite oxidation in P. stutzeri WM88. This, in addition to the amino acid sequence similarities of hypophosphite:2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase (HtxA)1 to members of the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family of enzymes, strongly suggests that htxA encodes a novel enzyme responsible for hypophosphite oxidation, HtxA. Sequence analysis of the phosphite oxidation region suggested the presence a binding protein-dependent phosphite transporter, encoded byptxABC, and an NAD:phosphite oxidoreductase (PtxD), encoded by ptxD (12Metcalf W.W. Wolfe R.S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5547-5558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Based on these data, a biochemical pathway for the oxidation of hypophosphite to phosphate was proposed (Fig.1) (12Metcalf W.W. Wolfe R.S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5547-5558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this pathway hypophosphite is first oxidized to phosphite by the HtxA protein. The phosphite produced in this reaction is subsequently oxidized to phosphate by the PtxD protein. Strong biochemical evidence has been provided for the second step in this putative pathway (14Vrtis J.M. White A.K. Metcalf W.W. van der Donk W.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 2672-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 15Costas A.M. White A.K. Metcalf W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17429-17436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The responsible enzyme, PtxD, has been characterized in pure form. This enzyme is highly specific for its substrates and stoichiometrically produces phosphate and NADH from phosphite and NAD+. However, biochemical support for the initial step, oxidation of hypophosphite to phosphite, has yet to be provided. In this paper we address this deficiency by reporting the purification and initial biochemical characterization of HtxA, thus completing the first biochemical characterization of a pathway for the oxidation of the reduced inorganic phosphorus compounds.DISCUSSIONAlthough there have been numerous accounts of microorganisms that can grow on hypophosphite as the sole source of phosphorus, the biochemical process by which this occurs had not been examined in detail, leaving a novel and significant area of phosphorus metabolism largely unexplored. The isolation and characterization of HtxA presented in this paper represent the first detailed biochemical analysis of an enzyme in pure form devoted to the oxidation of the reduced inorganic phosphorus compound, hypophosphite.HtxA catalyzes the first reaction in a pathway required for the acquisition of phosphate from the inorganic reduced phosphorus compound, hypophosphite. The biochemical characterization of HtxA presented here classifies this enzyme as a novel 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase. This family of enzymes is remarkably diverse in the reactions its members catalyze, which include amino acid hydroxylations, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, and degradation of alternative carbon and sulfur sources (for review, see Refs. 29Prescott A.G. Lloyd M.D. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2000; 17: 367-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar and 30De Carolis E. De Luca V. Phytochemistry. 1994; 36: 1093-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The commonality among all of the members of this family is that they all require activation of a molecule of dioxygen by enzyme-bound ferrous ions to generate a highly reactive ferryl oxidant. The formation of the ferryl species is linked to the oxidative decarboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate, giving rise to succinate and CO2, and mediates hydroxylation of the substrate (31Blanchard J.S. Englard S. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5922-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 32Hanauske-Abel H.M. J. Theor. Biol. 1982; 94: 421-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Thus, all members of this family are dependent on ferrous ions, oxygen, and 2-oxoglutarate (or a similar 2-oxoacid) for activity. Although the substrates acted upon by the members of this family are diverse, all that have been characterized, to our knowledge, act on organic substrates (29Prescott A.G. Lloyd M.D. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2000; 17: 367-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 30De Carolis E. De Luca V. Phytochemistry. 1994; 36: 1093-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In contrast, of the substrates tested in this study, HtxA showed the highest activity with the inorganic substrate hypophosphite, making it the first enzyme in this family to have an inorganic substrate. Several organic phosphorus compounds thought to be possible alternative substrates for HtxA (methylphosphinate, dimethylphosphinate, and methylphosphonate) were not oxidized by this enzyme.The low degree of amino acid sequence identity among 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases mirrors their catalytic diversity. Among the few highly conserved residues found in many members of this family are those that have been identified to be involved in binding of the ferrous ion. These residues form a conserved motif, designated the 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad, typical of non-heme Fe(II) enzymes (33Hegg E.L. Que L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Advanced spectroscopic techniques (34Hegg E.L. Whiting A.K. Saari R.E. McCracken J. Hausinger R.P. Que Jr., L.

The 2-His-1-carboxylate motif is also present in HtxA and its closest sequence homologs (Fig. 7). Prolyl 4-hydroxylase shows the highest degree of sequence similarity to HtxA, sharing 26% amino acid sequence identity. Phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase and an enzyme involved in mitomycin C biosynthesis, MmcH, share weaker homology to HtxA, with 23 and 22% identity, respectively. However, all share a variation to the common His-X-Asp-X 53–57-His motif that is characteristic to members of the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases superfamily and is thought to form the 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad (Fig. 7 and Ref. 38Borovok I. Landman O. Kreisberg Zakarin R. Aharonowitz Y. Cohen G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1981-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Within the group of HtxA homologs, the histidine residues believed to be involved in Fe(II) binding are spaced further apart in the amino acid sequence, giving a His-X-Asp-X 72–101-His-X 10(Arg/Lys)X-Ser motif that was found to be a distinct characteristic of this subgroup of enzymes, which do not share significant homology to other members of the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases family in the data base (40Hogan D.A.

Other conserved residues are also evident within the sequence of these proteins, but a function for these has yet to be ascribed.Figure 7Amino acid sequence alignment of HtxA with members of the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase superfamily.

All are characterized or putative members of the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase superfamily. The top three proteins were aligned with HtxA using ClustalW (55Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G.

Swiss Protein accession numbers for the sequences used are O69060, O06499, O14832, and Q9X556, respectively. Of the four enzymes shown, l-proline 4-hydroxylase has been studied the most extensively with regard to residues involved in forming the ferrous ion binding site (35Lamberg A. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9926-9931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The residues comprise the 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad (33Hegg E.L. Que L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar) and are conserved among these four proteins. They are indicated above the corresponding residues in the alignment. The binding motif shared by this subfamily of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases is written above the conserved sequences (40Hogan D.A. Smith S.R. Saari E.A. McCracken J. Hausinger R.P. J. Biol.

Interestingly, an uncoupled reaction of proline 4-hydroxylase has been well characterized, in which 2-oxoglutarate is oxidatively decarboxylated to succinate and CO2, without the concomitant hydroxylation of the substrate (24de Jong L. Albracht S.P.J. Kemp A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 704: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 25Nietfeld J.J. Kemp A. Biochim. Biophys.

J. 1996; 313: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, HtxA showed no such uncoupled reaction because succinate was not produced upon incubation of the enzyme with 2-oxoglutarate in the absence of hypophosphite.The effect of ascorbate on HtxA activity was explored because it has been reported to stabilize the activity of numerous members of this family of enzymes during the reaction. This effect is attributed to the role of ascorbate as a reducing agent that has been shown to counteract Fe(II) oxidation to inactive Fe(III), believed to occur as a side reaction during the hydroxylation of the substrate (24de Jong L. Albracht S.P.J. Kemp A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 704: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 25Nietfeld J.J. Kemp A. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 2000; 275: 31661-31667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In contrast, HtxA showed a marked decrease in activity in the presence of ascorbate, further demonstrating that the instability of the enzyme during the reaction is independent of ferrous ion oxidation. The nature of the instability appears to be simply the result of dilution of the enzyme, as has also been observed in 2-oxoglutarte-dependent taurine dioxygenase (27Eichhorn E. van der Ploeg J.R. Kertesz M.A. Leisinger T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23031-23036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and has not been explored further.HtxA was able to catalyze the oxidation of both arsenite and formate, although when comparing specific activities, hypophosphite was a slightly better substrate. Arsenite and formate were among those chosen as alternative substrates to examine based on their chemical and/or similarity to hypophosphite. Given these similarities and the relaxed substrate specificity observed in many of the members of this enzyme family (27Eichhorn E. van der Ploeg J.R. Kertesz M.A. Leisinger T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23031-23036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 45Fukumori F. Hausinger R.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 31661-31667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), it is not surprising that these compounds could be oxidized. This is especially true in light of the highly reactive dioxygen-derived ferryl species generated upon binding of 2-oxoglutarate and oxygen at the ferrous ion binding site thought to be involved in the hydroxylation of the substrate (for review, see Refs.29Prescott A.G. Lloyd M.D. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2000; 17: 367-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar and 47Que L.J. Ho R.Y.N. Chem. Reviews. 1996; 96: 2607-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). To be oxidized via this reaction, the only requirement for the compound would be that it fit into the active site in juxtaposition with this highly reactive ferryl species. Given the similarities of arsenite and formate to hypophosphite, this seems the most likely explanation for the relaxed substrate specificity of HtxA. Because formate can act as a substrate, it is also not surprising that formate significantly inhibits HtxA activity, probably because of competitive binding with hypophosphite at the active site. This further supports the conclusion that formate acts simply as a structural analog to hypophosphite. The structural similarity between these two compounds has been demonstrated previously by the ability of hypophosphite to act as a substrate analog to both pyruvate formate lyase (48Plaga W. Frank R. Knappe J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 178: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and formate hydrogenlyase and regulatory proteins involved in their expression (49Hopper S. Babst M. Schlensog V. Fischer H.M. Hennecke H. Bock A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19597-19604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the specific activity of HtxA with arsenite as a substrate is significant, arsenite is a poor inhibitor of HtxA activity, suggesting weak binding of arsenite in the active site (relative to hypophosphite). Thus, arsenite is also probably not the true substrate of HtxA. Considering both the biochemical evidence presented here and the regulation of the htx andptx loci by phosphate starvation (this report and Ref. 15Costas A.M. White A.K. Metcalf W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17429-17436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), hypophosphite is almost certainly the in vivo substrate for HtxA, with the role of providing P. stutzeri WM88 with an alternate phosphorus source via oxidation of inorganic reduced phosphorus compounds.Compared with other members of the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase enzyme family, HtxA shows somewhat strict cosubstrate specificity. Similar to taurine dioxygenase, HtxA was able to use only 2-oxoadipate to a significant degree in the place of 2-oxoglutarate (27Eichhorn E. van der Ploeg J.R. Kertesz M.A. Leisinger T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23031-23036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to most members of this family, which are able to use a broad range of 2-oxoacids, with or without a second carboxyl group (45Fukumori F. Hausinger R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24311-24317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Kahnert A. Kertesz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31661-31667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Both the cosubstrate specificity and the apparent Km for 2-oxoglutarate fall within the ranges observed for other members of this family.Because of the dearth of knowledge regarding biological oxidation of reduced phosphorus compounds and of the presence of these compounds in the soil, examining the substrate specificity of HtxA was essential to understanding the physiological role of this enzyme in phosphorus metabolism. It is clear from the genetic analysis that thehtxA gene allows P. stutzeri WM88 to grow on hypophosphite as a sole phosphorus source and at a rate similar to growth on phosphate (12Metcalf W.W. Wolfe R.S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5547-5558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, examination of the regulation of expression of the ptx and htx operons indicates that both are highly expressed under conditions of phosphate starvation, including growth on both limiting phosphate and on hypophosphite or phosphite as the sole phosphorus sources. Sequence analysis of the region upstream from the htxA translation start site revealed the presence of a Pho box (data not shown), a conserved binding sequence for transcriptional activation via PhoB (50Makino K. Shinagawa H. Amemura M. Nakata A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In numerous microorganisms, PhoB is the response regulator responsible for activating transcription of the Pho regulon, which is comprised of numerous phosphate starvation-inducible loci, all involved in the assimilation of phosphorus in response to phosphate starvation. These genetic data strongly suggest that the in vivo role of these genes is to allow use of an alternative phosphorus source, such as phosphite and hypophosphite.What is less clear is the extent to which hypophosphite is present in nature. Although it is widely used industrially as a reducing agent, and microbe-mediated reduction of phosphate to phosphite, hypophosphite, and phosphine has been reported (3Tsubota G. Soil Plant Food. 1959; 5: 10-15Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 51Devai I. Felfoldy L. Wittner I. Plosz S. Nature. 1988; 333: 343-345Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar), no direct measurements of inorganic reduced phosphorus compounds in the soil have been documented. The apparent Km of HtxA for hypophosphite of 0.58 mm is quite likely to be sufficiently low to support growth of this organism on even the very low concentrations of hypophosphite one might expect to find in the environment. This is particularly true given that htxAappears to be cotranscribed with a binding protein-dependent transporter that is required, in addition to htxA, for growth on hypophosphite in the heterologous hosts, E. coliand Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12Metcalf W.W. Wolfe R.S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5547-5558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such transporters are known to be able to accumulate very high intracellular levels of their substrate, with concentration gradients of up to 100,000-fold (52Szmelcman S. Schwartz M. Silhavy T.J. Boos W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), which would put intracellular hypophosphite concentrations well within the range allowing HtxA to catalyze in vivo hypophosphite oxidation.Finally, hypophosphite oxidation has been studied previously inB. caldolyticus, and activity was found to be dependent on NAD+ (11Heinen W. Lauwers A.M. Arch. Microbiol. 1974; 95: 267-274Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and anaerobic oxidation of hypophosphite has been documented in uncharacterized Bacillus isolate (8Foster T.L. Winans Jr., L. Helms S.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1978; 35: 937-944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to these findings, HtxA does not require NAD+ for oxidation of hypophosphite, and oxygen is absolutely required for the HtxA reaction. This indicates that HtxA is a very di"

To elucidate the regulation of PS-mediated γ-cleavage, we developed a new functional screening method for identifying cDNA that enhances γ-cleavage. This screening system utilizes our own developed cell line, where the expression of cDNA that enhances γ-cleavage confers puromycin resistance. The cDNA library is retrovirally delivered to the above-mentioned cell line, allowing the identification of our target cDNAs by a combination of puromycin resistance selection and Aβ assay screening. With this screening method, we isolated several cDNAs enhancing γ-cleavage, including the previously reported Herp. Here we also demonstrate that Rab1A, identified with this screening, can be a regulator of Aβ generation. Thus, our established screening method is a powerful tool for identifying multiple regulators involved in γ-cleavage in the Aβ generation pathway, including modulators of γ-secretase activity or the intracellular trafficking of factors necessary for γ-cleavage.

The PS complex appears to be responsible for inducing γ-secretase activity (12Li Y.M. Lai M.T., Xu, M. Huang Q. DiMuzio-Mower J. Sardana M.K. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Proc. Natl.

The discrepancy between the intracellular major distribution of the PS complex and the intracellular site of γ-cleavage also remains to be clarified (reviewed in Ref. 17Sisodia S.S. St George-Hyslop P.H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Therefore, the understanding of the mechanism underlying γ-cleavage will require clarification of multiple factors involved in γ-cleavage, including the components of the γ-secretase complex and modulators of the γ-secretase activity or the trafficking of factors necessary for γ-cleavage. To elucidate how PS-mediated γ-cleavage is regulated, we developed a new functional screening method for identifying cDNA that enhances γ-cleavage using a combination of puromycin resistance assay and Aβ quantitation. To date, a number of PS-interacting proteins have been identified by the yeast two-hybrid screening method that utilizes the binding affinity with PS; however, no natural interactors with PS have been found to modulate Aβ generation except for nicastrin (13Esler W.P. Kimberly W.T. Ostaszewski B.L., Ye, W. Diehl T.S. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2720-2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 18Yu G. Nishimura M.

Therefore, we employed the functional screening assay to measure the Aβ level, instead of the binding assay of PS. In addition, prior to the screening step using the Aβ assay, we selected cDNAs that confer puromycin resistance on the cells resulting from an increase in the degree of intramembranous proteolytic cleavage. This selection step facilitates the identification of our target cDNAs. Thus, the screening system that we developed is a powerful tool for identifying multiple factors involved in γ-cleavage, including modulators of γ-secretase activity or the trafficking of factors necessary for γ-cleavage. Previously, we reported that the ER stress-inducible protein, Herp (19Kokame K. Agarwala K.L. Kato H. Miyata T. J. Biol.

Here we present the details of our newly developed functional screening method for the identification of γ-cleavage-enhancing factors, and also demonstrate that Rab1A, which is implicated in protein trafficking from the ER to the Golgi apparatus (reviewed in Ref. 21Zerial M. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), can be another regulator of γ-cleavage in the Aβ generation pathway. The monoclonal antibody 6E10 specific to human Aβ1–17 was purchased from Senetek (St. Louis, MO). The other Aβ antibodies have all been characterized previously (22Asami-Odaka A. Ishibashi Y. Kikuchi T. Kitada C. Suzuki N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10272-10278Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The antibody against Rab1A was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The anti-APP N-terminal antibody was purchased from Sigma. The affinity-purified rabbit antibody, B12/4, was raised against 20 C-terminal amino acid residues of APP695 (23De Strooper B. Simons M.

Ba/F3 cells of the murine pro-B cell line were maintained as previously described (24Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Morikawa Y. Shibuya A. Phillips J. Lanier L.L. Gorman D.M. Nolan G.P. Miyajima A.

By the PCR method, we generated a chimeral cDNA encoding C53NICD, which consists of the first Met plus Asp596–Leu648 fragment of APP695 and the NICD (from Ser1745 to the C terminus) of mouse Notch-1 (25Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). The primer sequences used for the PCR are as follows: primers for C53, 5′-ATCTGGTACCCCACCATGGATGCAGAATTCCGACATGAC-3′ and 5′-GCTTCTAGACAGCATCACCAAGGTGATGACGAT-3′; primers for NICD, 5′-CTGTCTAGAAAGCGCCGGCGCCAGCATGGCCAG-3′ and 5′-ATTGTTCACCGCGGCCGCCCAATG-3′. This chimeric cDNA was inserted into pCxN at KpnI and NotI sites, which have been introduced at the EcoRI site of pCxN (26Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J.

The resulting plasmid was designated as PGV-B-HES-1, which carries the luciferase-coding fragment under the control of the HES-1 promoter. (ii) aHindIII-BamHI luciferase-coding fragment in PGV-B-HES-1 was replaced with aHindIII-BamHI fragment of pPUR (CLONTECH) containing pac (designated as pHES-1-pac). pMX-Rab1A is a 1.4-kb BamHI-SalI fragment carrying the Rab1A-coding region inserted into theBamHI and SalI sites of a retrovirus vector, pMX (24Onishi M.

All resulting constructs were verified by DNA sequence. Human hippocampus cDNAs were synthesized from human hippocampus mRNA (CLONTECH) using the SuperScriptTM Choice system (Invitrogen) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. The cDNAs were inserted into the BstXI site of pMX, using the BstXI adaptor (Invitrogen). The resulting cDNA library contains 4 × 106 independent colonies, and the average size of the insert DNA is 1.6 kb. Retrovirus-mediated gene expression in cells was carried out as previously reported (24Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Morikawa Y. Shibuya A. Phillips J. Lanier L.L. Gorman D.M. Nolan G.P. Miyajima A.

The target cells (4 × 106) were retrovirally expressed with human hippocampus cDNA library and grown on 96-well plates (the initial cell number and density were 104 cells/well and 105 cells/ml, respectively). At 48 h after retroviral infection, the cells were subjected to puromycin resistance selection using the minimum lethal dose of puromycin (9 μg/ml puromycin for A5-9-PS1 cells; 20 μg/ml puromycin for A5-9 cells). The functional screening procedure was described in the text. The cDNAs transduced into the cells were extracted and amplified by PCR using vector primers (primer sequences: 5′-GGTGGACCATCCTCTAGACTG-3′ and 5′-GTTACTTAAGCTAGCTTGCC-3′) and sequenced. The secreted Aβ was immunoprecipitated with 6E10 and detected using a highly sensitive immunoblotting technique with BA27 (for Aβ40) or BC05 (for Aβ42) as previously described (30Sudoh S. Hua G.

Kitada C. Suzuki N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10272-10278Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). ELISA data were statistically analyzed by analysis of variance using StatView-J.4.11. Intracellular C99 was immunodetected as previously described (30Sudoh S. Hua G. Kawamura Y. Maruyama K. Komano H. Yanagisawa K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2036-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The cells cotransfected with PGV-B-HES-1 and pRL-tk were analyzed using a luciferase assay system (Promega). TheRenilla luciferase expression plasmid, pRL-tk (Promega), was used as an internal control for transfection. Our functional screening system utilizes the transcriptional activity of the Notch-1 intracellular domain (NICD) released from the membrane following transmembranous cleavage of Notch-1 (25Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar).

We also generated a puromycin resistance gene (pac) driven by the HES-1 promoter (a DNA element responsible for Notch-dependent gene expression) (25Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R.

Chem. 1994; 269: 5150-5156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.1 B). Using the two DNAs, we designed a functional screening system based on the following idea. (i) In the cells stably expressing C53NICD and pac driven by the HES-1 promoter, an increase in the degree of γ-cleavage should confer an increase in puromycin resistance and Aβ generation (Fig. 1 B). (ii) Therefore, when the above-mentioned stable cells were transfected with a cDNA library, the cells harboring a cDNA that enhances γ-cleavage should be first selected as puromycin-resistant clones, and then identified by the screening for cells generating a higher Aβ level. Prior to carrying out the above functional screening, we first investigated whether the expression of C53NICD in cells leads to Aβ generation and activates the HES-1 promoter. As shown in Fig.2 A, Neuro 2a cells transiently expressing C53NICD generated Aβ40 and Aβ42 as well as the cells expressing C99, indicating that C53NICD undergoes γ-cleavage in the cells as APP does. We next addressed whether C53NICD activates the expression of the gene under the control of the HES-1 promoter. For this purpose, we constructed a plasmid carrying the luciferase-coding gene driven by the HES-1 promoter, and performed luciferase assay. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the expression of the luciferase gene was induced by the HES-1 promoter when it was cotransfected with a plasmid encoding C53NICD, but not with a plasmid encoding C99. This result indicates that the expression of C53NICD causes NICD-dependent HES-1 promoter-mediated gene activation in the cells. Furthermore, to exclude the possibility of the activation of the HES-1-driven gene by nonspecific generation of NICD-like fragments from C53NICD, we next determined using PS-deficient cells whether the activation of the luciferase gene depends on PS. As shown in Fig.2 C, the activation of the luciferase gene completely depended on PS, indicating that the release of NICD from C53NICD, as well as that from Notch-1, depends on PS. This result strongly supports the reliability of the puromycin selection step in the above-described screening system. Thus, we decided to develop our designed functional screening method, because we ascertained that γ-cleavage of C53NICD generates Aβ, accompanied by PS-dependent activation of HES-1 promoter-mediated transcription. For a functional screening assay, a stable expression of cDNA in cells is preferable. Therefore, we employed the retrovirus-mediated gene expression method (24Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Morikawa Y.

As parental cells of the target cells for the transduction of a cDNA library, we chose BaF/3 cells of the murine pro-B cell line because high efficiency retrovirus infection is attained in BaF/3 cells (24Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Morikawa Y. Shibuya A. Phillips J. Lanier L.L. Gorman D.M. Nolan G.P. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Exp. Hematol. 1996; 24: 324-329PubMed Google Scholar, 36Kitamura T. Onishi M. Kinoshita S.

Thus, as target cells for stable transduction of a cDNA library, we established BaF/3 cells stably transfected with pCxN-C53NICD (see “Experimental Procedures”) and pHES-1-pac (see “Experimental Procedures”) (designated as A5-9). We also established A5-9 cells stably expressing human PS1 (designated as A5-9-PS1), because the use of the cells overexpressing PS1 might help to identify the activator of γ-secretase, as PS is essential for the γ-secretase activity. The scheme of the screening procedure used is shown in Fig. 3. To initiate screening, a human hippocampus-derived cDNA library was retrovirally transduced into A5-9 or A5-9-PS1 cells. At 48 h after retroviral infection, the cells were subjected to puromycin resistance selection. The cells were treated with a lethal dose of puromycin to select the cells expressing cDNA encoding a γ-cleavage-enhancing factor. After 2 weeks of growth, surviving clones were picked up and again treated with the same dosage of puromycin to eliminate clones that were transiently resistant to puromycin. To identify the clones exhibiting an increased Aβ level, Aβ secreted from puromycin-resistant clones was detected using a highly sensitive immunoblotting method. We found that some of the puromycin-resistant clones clearly exhibited an increased Aβ level (Fig. 4). TableI shows the number of puromycin-resistant clones and the number of the clones with an increased Aβ (Aβ40) level. Out of 4 × 106 cells transduced with cDNA library, approximately 30 (target cells, A5-9-PS1) or 10 (target cells, A5-9) clones exhibited the puromycin-resistant phenotype (Table I). Among them, approximately 10 clones exhibited an increase in the Aβ level (Table I). Next, the cDNAs from the puromycin-resistant clones with an increased Aβ40 level were amplified by PCR using vector primers. One of these DNAs encoded Herp (19Kokame K. Agarwala K.L. Kato H. Miyata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32846-32853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), which was previously reported to enhance Aβ generation from APP (20Sai X. Kawamura Y. Kokame K. Yamaguchi H. Shiraishi H. Suzuki R. Suzuki T. Kawaichi M. Miyata T. Kitamura T. Strooper B.D. Yanagisawa K. Komano H. J. Biol.

From another puromycin-resistant clone with an increased Aβ level (clone 28 in Fig. 5 A), we obtained 1.4-kb PCR product containing the open reading frame encoding the entire Rab1A amino acid sequence. Rab1A is implicated in protein trafficking from the ER to the Golgi apparatus (reviewed in Ref. 21Zerial M. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). We further determined whether Rab1A is responsible for conferring puromycin resistance and an increased ability of Aβ generation on A5-9-PS1 cells. As shown in Table II, the expression of Rab1A conferred puromycin resistance on A5-9-PS1 cells. We also confirmed that the puromycin-resistant cells obtained after the retroviral transduction of Rab1A cDNA secreted higher levels of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 than A5-9-PS1 cells (Fig. 5 B). These results clearly indicated that the Rab1A cDNA is a gene responsible for exhibiting puromycin resistance and enhanced Aβ generation. Characterization of other such cDNAs are under way.Figure 4Levels of Aβ secreted from puromycin resistant clones.

After 2 weeks, dead cells were stained with trypan blue (Invitrogen) and the surviving cells in one well were counted. Data are means (27 S.D. (n = 3). We next investigated whether Rab1A increases Aβ generation from full-length APP using murine fibroblasts. As shown in Fig.6 A, the expression of Rab1A clearly increased secreted Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels. Quantification by ELISA revealed that the expression of Rab1A increased the levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 3- and 2-fold, respectively (Fig. 6 B). The difference in the degrees of increase in Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels suggested distinct molecular mechanisms underlying the generation between the two Aβ variants. The level of soluble APP (sAPP; reviewed in Ref. 1Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18295-18298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar), which is generated through α- or β-cleavage, was also slightly increased by Rab1A expression, whereas no significant change in the intracellular APP level was observed (Fig. 6 C). The degree of an increase in sAPP level was less than 2-fold, because the band intensity of one-half the amount of sAPP secreted from the fibroblasts expressing Rab1A was lower than that of total sAPP secreted from the mock fibroblasts (Fig. 6 C). These results indicated that Rab1A expression increased the degree of γ-cleavage greater than that of α- or β-cleavage. In addition, the intracellular level of C99, which is a substrate of γ-secretase, was significantly reduced by a high expression level of Rab1A (Fig. 6 D), providing strong evidence that Rab1A expression enhances γ-cleavage, resulting in an increase in Aβ generation. The cytoplasmic tail of APP contains important sorting determinants (37Lai A. Sisodia S.S. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3565-3573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and sequence elements required for interaction with proteins including X11, which influences APP processing and Aβ generation (38Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Sastre M. Turner R.S. Levy E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2243-2254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Therefore, to know whether the effect of Rab1A on Aβ generation depends on the cytoplasmic tail of APP, we next addressed whether the expression of Rab1A increases the Aβ generation from APP lacking the cytoplasmic tail (APPΔC). As shown in Fig.7 A, the expression of Rab1A increased Aβ generation even from APPΔC, although the degree of increase was slightly small. Therefore, the cytoplasmic domain of APP or the intracellular trafficking of APP mediated by the cytoplasmic domain is not essential for an increase in Αβ generation by the expression of Rab1A. The deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of APP drastically enhanced sAPP generation as previously reported (33Haass C. Hung A.Y. Schlossmacher M.G. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3021-3024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 7 B). It is also noted that the expression of Rab1A did not result in an enhanced sAPP generation from APPΔC (Fig.7 B; for the quantitative analysis of sAPP production, see Fig. 7 C). An increase in Aβ generation from APPΔC caused by Rab1A expression, which was accompanied by no increase in sAPP generation, clearly indicates that the expression of Rab1A increases γ-cleavage, which is not the result of the simple stimulation of the trafficking of the APPΔC from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. We also found that a high expression level of Rab1A did not alter the steady-state levels of full-length PS and its endocleaved product, N-terminal fragment (data not shown), strongly suggesting that a high expression level of Rab1A did not affect the trafficking of PS from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, because the endoproteolysis of PS is likely to occur in the ER-cis-Golgi intermediate compartment (reviewed in Ref.17Sisodia S.S. St George-Hyslop P.H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Thus far, the involvement of several Rab proteins in the pathway for Aβ or soluble APP generation has been addressed (41Dugan J.M. deWit C. McConlogue L. Maltese W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10982-10989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 42McConlogue L. Castellano F. deWit C. Schenk D. Maltese W.A. J. Biol.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 910-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, the role of Rab proteins in the γ-cleavage pathway is not yet clarified. Our study provided strong evidence that Rab1A, which is known to be involved in protein trafficking from the ER to the Golgi apparatus (reviewed in Ref. 21Zerial M. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), plays a role in the γ-cleavage pathway. Previously, the ER-cis-Golgi intermediate compartment has been suggested to be a site for Aβ generation (44Annaert W.G. Levesque L. Craessaerts K. Dierinck I. Snellings G. Westaway D., St George-Hyslop P. Cordell B. Fraser P. De Strooper B. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 277-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 45Greenfield J.P. Tsai J. Gouras G.K. Hai B.

In this regard, ER localization of Rab1A well agrees with the ER being the intracellular site of Aβ generation. In addition, in PS1-deficient cells, C99 is accumulated in the ER without undergoing γ-cleavage (46Xia W. Zhang J. Ostaszewski B.L. Kimberly W.T. Seubert P. Koo E.H. Shen J. Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16465-16471Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 47Chen F. Yang D.S. Petanceska S. Yang A. Tandon A., Yu, G. Rozmahel R. Ghiso J. Nishimura M. Zhang D.M. Kawarai T.

Chem. 2000; 275: 36794-36802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for this is that C99 in PS1-deficient cells is retrogradely trafficked to the ER after it is generated through the β-secretase cleavage of APP in a late Golgi compartment ortrans-Golgi network. Therefore, Rab1A could enhance γ-cleavage of ER-localized C99, which is retrogradely trafficked back to the ER. However, accumulating evidence showed that the major intracellular site of γ-cleavage is not the ER, but, most likely, thetrans-Golgi network (30Sudoh S. Hua G. Kawamura Y. Maruyama K. Komano H. Yanagisawa K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2036-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 31Maltese W.A. Wilson S. Tan Y. Suomensaari S. Sinha S. Barbour R. McConlogue L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 21678-21685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this regard, it is noteworthy that Rab1A not only exists in the ER, but is also associated with the transcytotic vesicle (50Jin M. Saucan L. Farquhar M.G. Palade G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30105-30113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This indicates that the function of Rab1A is not limited to protein trafficking from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. Rab1A could be involved in γ-cleavage in its other destinations or during its travel to the transcytotic vesicle or an as yet identified compartment. At present, we do not know whether Rab1A activates γ-secretase or modulates the trafficking of the factors involved in γ-cleavage, including PS and nicastrin. Further study on the mechanism underlying the enhancement of γ-cleavage caused by a high expression level of Rab1A is necessary. In this study, we showed a new functional screening method for identifying factors involved in γ-cleavage and also identified Rab1A by this method. Previously, we reported that the ER stress-inducible protein, Herp, which was identified by this method, enhanced γ-cleavage and bound to PS (20Sai X. Kawamura Y. Kokame K. Yamaguchi H. Shiraishi H. Suzuki R. Suzuki T. Kawaichi M. Miyata T. Kitamura T. Strooper B.D. Yanagisawa K. Komano H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12915-12920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that Herp is an inducible regulator of γ-secretase. In contrast, Rab1A appears to constitutively regulate γ-cleavage in the Aβ generation pathway. Interestingly, both of the two identified proteins are ER-localized proteins, suggesting that the ER or an ER-derived compartment plays a critical role in the γ-cleavage pathway. The other factors identified by this method are now under investigation. We believe that our established functional screening method is a powerful tool for identifying multiple factors, including activators of γ-secretase (or γ-secretase itself) and modulators of the trafficking of the factors involved in γ-cleavage in the Aβ generation pathway. Identification of the factors required for γ-cleavage will enable the comprehensive study of the mechanism underlying the intermembranous proteolytic cleavage mediated by PS. In addition, such factors could be new candidate therapeutic targets for AD. We thank H. Kumagai (Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) for helpful technical advice. We thank G. P.

An example of size regulation occurs in the simple eukaryote Dictyostelium discoideum, which during development forms groups of ∼2 × 104cells. Dictyostelium grows on soil surfaces and feeds on bacteria as an individual amoeba when the food source is ample (for review see Refs. 1Loomis W.F. Dictyostelium discoideum: A Developmental System.

Cambridge University Press, New York2001Crossref Google Scholar). The cells eventually overgrow their food supply, and a cell signals that it is starving by secreting a cell density-sensing factor called conditioned medium factor (3Mehdy M.C. Firtel R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 4Yuen I.S. Jain R. Bishop J.D. Lindsey D.F. Deery W.J. Van Haastert P.J.M. Gomer R.H. J.

Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 390-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).As more and more cells starve, the local conditioned medium factor concentration reaches a threshold level. This allows cells to aggregate using relayed pulses of cAMP as a chemoattractant (6Brazill D.T. Lindsey D.F. Bishop J.D. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8161-8168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 7Parent C.A. Devreotes P.N. Science. 1999; 284: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). The cells form dendritic aggregation streams (for review see Refs. 2Kessin R.H. Bard J.B.L. Barlow P.W. Kirk D.L. Dictyostelium Evolution, Cell Biology, and the Development of Multicellularity. Cambridge University Press, New York2001Crossref Google Scholar and 8Varnum-Finney B. Edwards K.B. Voss E. Soll D.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskelet. 1987; 8: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The cAMP pulses also regulate the expression of many genes specifically expressed during early development (for review see Ref. 9Verkerke-van Wijk I. Schaap P. Maeda Y. Inouye K. Takeuchi I. Dictyostelium: A Model System for Cell and Developmental Biology. Universal Academy Press, Tokyo, Japan1997: 145-162Google Scholar). A rapid cGMP pulse is also generated in response to a cAMP pulse (9Verkerke-van Wijk I. Schaap P. Maeda Y. Inouye K. Takeuchi I. Dictyostelium: A Model System for Cell and Developmental Biology. Universal Academy Press, Tokyo, Japan1997: 145-162Google Scholar, 10Ma H. Gamper M. Parent C. Firtel R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4317-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The aggregating cells produce a fruiting body consisting of a spore mass held atop a rigid stem of stalk cells. When a fruiting body is too small, the spore mass will be too close to the ground for optimal spore dispersal. If a spore mass is too big, it will slide down the stalk or the fruiting body will fall over. Therefore, the formation of an optimal size spore mass and stalk is of utmost importance (for review see Ref. 11Brown J.M. Firtel R.A. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 191-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). One of the ways in which an upper limit to fruiting body size is established is by breaking up large aggregation streams into groups of ∼2 × 104 cells, with each group developing into a fruiting body (12Shaffer B.M. Q. J. Microsc. Sci. 1957; 98: 393-405Google Scholar).A secreted protein complex regulates stream breakup and thus group size. Wild-type cells secrete this protein complex, named counting factor (CF),1 at a moderate level. Disruption of the smlA gene leads to the oversecretion of CF, resulting in the formation of much smaller groups than wild type (13Brock D.A. Buczynski F. Spann T.P. Wood S.A. Cardelli J. Gomer R.H. Development. 1996; 122: 2569-2578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In smlA − cells, the streams are severely fragmented, thereby forming large numbers of tiny fruiting bodies. The addition of purified CF to wild-type cells also decreases group size. CF seems to consist of at least five polypeptides, forming a complex of about 450 kDa. Two of these polypeptides are countin and CF50. When the countin orcf50 genes are disrupted, the cells secrete very little detectable CF activity (14Brock D.A. Gomer R.H.

A. 2002; 99: 1371-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). When both adhesion and motility are controlled by a secreted factor such as CF, more precise group control can be achieved. One of the major adhesion molecules utilized during early development is gp24 (18Loomis W.F. Dev. Genet. 1988; 9: 549-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). gp24 is down-regulated by CF, and when anti-gp24 antibodies were added to the cells to mimic this effect the group size decreased (16Roisin-Bouffay C. Jang W. Gomer R.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). CF also decreases group size by increasing the amount of polymerized actin (F-actin) and decreasing the amount of polymerized myosin II, which in turn increases the motility of cells (17Tang L. Gao T. McCollum C. Jang W. Vickers M.G. Ammann R. Gomer R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1371-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, CF down-regulates the cAMP-induced cGMP pulse and up-regulates the cAMP-induced cAMP pulse (19Tang L. Ammann R. Gao T. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27663-27669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that CF regulates the cAMP-induced cGMP and cAMP pulses and that these may in turn mediate the effect of CF on adhesion and motility.Garrod and Ashworth (20Garrod D.R. Ashworth J.M. J. Embryol. Exp. Morph. 1972; 28: 463-479PubMed Google Scholar) showed that wild-type cells grown with a high concentration (86 mm) of glucose formed 2.6 times larger fruiting bodies than control cells. In addition, Kishi et al. (21Kishi Y. Mahadeo D. Cervi D.N. Clements C. Cotter D.A. Sameshima M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) found that 1 mm glucose can triggerDictyostelium spores to dephosphorylate actin, a key step in the germination pathway, indicating that relatively low levels of glucose can act as a signal in Dictyostelium. In growing and developing cells the internal glucose concentration is ∼2.4 mm but tends to vary depending on growth conditions and cell density (22Wright B.E. Gustafson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7875-7884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gustafson G.L. Wright B.E. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1972; 1: 453-478Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, the concentrations of subsequent products of glycolysis such as glucose-6-phosphate are very constant (22Wright B.E. Gustafson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7875-7884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gustafson G.L. Wright B.E. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1972; 1: 453-478Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This appears to be due to the fact that theK m of Dictyostelium glucokinase for glucose is 0.12 mm (24Baumann P. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 5011-5015Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus the internal glucose concentration in the cells is sufficient to saturate the enzyme, suggesting that the rate of glycolysis would be constant even when the levels of glucose are very different in cells. Together, these observations suggested the possibility that there might be a relationship between glucose levels and group size.DISCUSSIONCF decreases group size in Dictyostelium (13Brock D.A. Buczynski F. Spann T.P. Wood S.A. Cardelli J. Gomer R.H. Development. 1996; 122: 2569-2578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Brock D.A. Gomer R.H.

Chem. 2001; 276: 27663-27669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this report, we find that CF decreases internal glucose levels and that low glucose levels cause a decreased group size.We observed that there are differences in glucose levels insmlA −, wild-type, andcountin − cells and that these differences can be observed in mid-log phase vegetative cells (Fig. 1 A). However, these cells appeared to have indistinguishable growth rates, 2R. Ammann and R. H. Gomer, unpublished data. suggesting that they are using energy at the same rate. One possible explanation for this could be that although the glucose levels are different, the flux of glucose through the glycolytic pathway is the same in these cells. This is consistent with previous observations that although glucose levels tend to vary depending on culture conditions, the levels of intermediates in the glycolysis pathway appears to be invariant (22Wright B.E. Gustafson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7875-7884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,23Gustafson G.L. Wright B.E. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1972; 1: 453-478Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The ability of countin to affect glucose levels within 60 s suggests the existence of a fast signal transduction pathway. How the glucose levels are changed so quickly remains to be elucidated.Adding recombinant countin or depleting countin at the time of starvation alters internal glucose levels during later development. However, the degree of change is not as great as what we see in the different cell lines (Fig. 1, A and B). One of the possible explanations for this is thatsmlA − and countin −cells start development with different concentrations of glucose compared with wild-type cells. We have found that components of CF are secreted and affect cells during vegetative growth (15Brock D.A. Hatton R.D. Giurgiutiu D.-V. Scott B. Ammann R. Gomer R.H. Development. 2002; 129: 3657-3668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Gao T. Ehrenman K. Tang L. Leippe M. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277 (June 17, 2002): 32596-32605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore,smlA − and countin −cells are exposed to different levels of CF even before starvation, which may explain the different glucose levels in vegetative cells. Extracellular glucose levels in smlA −, wild-type, and countin − cells starved at 5 × 106 cells/ml are less than 6 μm. Assuming that starving cells are ∼2 × 108 cells/ml in the stream and ignoring diffusion out of the stream or reuptake by the cells, the extracellular glucose concentration would then be ∼0.24 mm, less than the minimal concentration needed to affect group size or motility. This then suggests that secreted glucose does not play a significant role in group size regulation.Exposure of starving cells to 1 or 10 mm glucose caused a clear increase in group size (Fig. 2). Group size can be affected by territory size, stream breakup, or mound breakup. We observed that, like CF, glucose affected stream breakup rather than altering territory size or mound breakup. Glucose partially negated the effects of the addition of key components of the CF complex, countin and CF50, suggesting that glucose may be a downstream effector of the CF signal transduction pathway (Fig. 3). Glucose affected two main downstream targets of CF, cell-cell adhesion and motility. Increasing glucose or decreasing CF both increase gp24 levels, adhesion, and myosin polymerization and decrease actin polymerization and motility, suggesting that glucose affects group size by a pathway qualitatively similar to that used by CF. CF increases the size of the cAMP-induced cAMP pulse (19Tang L. Ammann R. Gao T. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27663-27669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and the addition of glucose decreased the cAMP pulse size (Fig. 5 A). Together, these observations suggest that glucose may affect and be part of the CF signal transduction pathway. However, at this point, we do not know whether the effector is glucoseper se or one of its metabolites.Glucose increased cell-cell adhesion by 11.6% and decreased motility by 27.8%. We previously observed that small changes in adhesion and motility can affect group size (16Roisin-Bouffay C. Jang W. Gomer R.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Tang L. Gao T. McCollum C. Jang W. Vickers M.G. Ammann R. Gomer R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1371-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Using computer simulations to model stream breakup, we observed that although changing adhesion alone or motility alone by these amounts only slightly increased group size (Fig. 7), changing both adhesion and motility by these amounts increased group size by roughly 30%, the amount observed with glucose.The only significant difference we observed betweencountin − cells and cells exposed to 1 mm glucose was in the cAMP-induced cGMP pulse (Ref. 19Tang L. Ammann R. Gao T. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27663-27669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar and Fig. 5 B). countin − cells have a large and prolonged cGMP pulse, whereas high glucose causes cells to have a prolonged pulse. This suggests that CF affects a pathway in addition to glucose.It is unclear why the levels of glucose or one of its metabolites appear to be part of a signal transduction pathway. InEscherichia coli, glucose inhibits cAMP synthesis, and low glucose levels increase the levels of cAMP (28Makman R. Sutherland E. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 1309-1314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Peterkofsky A. Gazdar C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 2794-2798Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our observations that glucose inhibits the cAMP pulse are thus similar to those observed in E. coli. Having found that low cAMP pulses cause motility to decrease (17Tang L. Gao T. McCollum C. Jang W. Vickers M.G. Ammann R. Gomer R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1371-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), our working hypothesis is that the countin-glucose-adhesion/motility pathway may have evolved from a chemotaxis mechanism used by an ancestral motile unicellular eukaryote. When this cell was in an area with low nutrients, as indicated by low internal glucose levels, we hypothesize that it would try to move by increasing motility and decreasing adhesion. However, when it found a food source and when nutrient levels and possibly internal glucose levels increased, the cell would try to stay at the source by decreasing motility and increasing adhesion. We believe that this simple mechanism may have, during evolution, become modulated by the CF signal to regulate group size. We do not know the molecular mechanism whereby glucose affects the cAMP-induced cAMP pulse, adhesion, or motility. In other systems, glucose appears to affect adenylyl cyclase and Akt/PKB (30Nam S. Amoscato A. Lee Y. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 337-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kawabe J.-I. Aizawa Y. Takehara N. Hasebe N. Kikuchi K. J. Hypertens. 2000; 18: 1457-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Because these regulate the cAMP pulse and motility, respectively, in Dictyostelium (32Pitt G.S. Milona N. Borleis J.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2092-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), one possibility is that these processes may be regulated by glucose.In mammalian cells and Caenorhabditis elegans, the insulin or insulin-like growth factor signal transduction pathway plays an important role in cell and/or tissue growth by regulating protein synthesis (for review see Ref. 34Gomer R.H. Nat. Rev. 2001; 2: 48-54Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, body size decreases when mutations occur in genes for the insulin receptor, CHICO (a homolog of the insulin receptor substrate), phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase, and S6 kinase (35Chen C. Jack J. Garofalo R.S. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 846-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 36Leevers S.J. Weinkove D. MacDougall L.K. Hafen E.

Science. 1999; 285: 2126-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). When phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase is overexpressed in the responsive primorida and the flies are grown on rich medium, an increase in the size of wings and eyes can be observed. Insulin regulates the level and uptake of glucose in higher eukaryotes (39Lehninger A. Nelson D. Cox M. Principles of Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Worth Publishers, New York1993: 759-760Google Scholar). Nutrients can regulate cell growth and proliferation through the mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (for review see Ref. 40Schmelzle T. Hall M. Cell. 2000; 103: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). Protein synthesis is also controlled by signaling through mTOR (41Thomas G. Hall M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 42Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q. Kozlowski M. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). Insulin activates eukaryotic initiation factors through the mTOR signaling pathway, and 1–5 mm glucose promotes this activity of insulin (43Patel J. Wang X. Proud C. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Because insulin elevates cytosolic glucose levels, this suggests that insulin activates mTOR partially by increasing glucose levels. Thus an intriguing possibility is that secreted factors regulate glucose levels to regulate tissue size in higher eukaryotes. Little is known about how a multicellular organism regulates the size of its tissues during development. An example of size regulation occurs in the simple eukaryote Dictyostelium discoideum, which during development forms groups of ∼2 × 104cells. Dictyostelium grows on soil surfaces and feeds on bacteria as an individual amoeba when the food source is ample (for review see Refs. 1Loomis W.F. Dictyostelium discoideum: A Developmental System. Academic Press, New York1975Google Scholar and 2Kessin R.H. Bard J.B.L. Barlow P.W. Kirk D.L. Dictyostelium Evolution, Cell Biology, and the Development of Multicellularity. Cambridge University Press, New York2001Crossref Google Scholar). The cells eventually overgrow their food supply, and a cell signals that it is starving by secreting a cell density-sensing factor called conditioned medium factor (3Mehdy M.C. Firtel R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 4Yuen I.S. Jain R. Bishop J.D. Lindsey D.F. Deery W.J. Van Haastert P.J.M. Gomer R.H. J.

As more and more cells starve, the local conditioned medium factor concentration reaches a threshold level. This allows cells to aggregate using relayed pulses of cAMP as a chemoattractant (6Brazill D.T. Lindsey D.F. Bishop J.D. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8161-8168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 7Parent C.A. Devreotes P.N. Science. 1999; 284: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). The cells form dendritic aggregation streams (for review see Refs. 2Kessin R.H. Bard J.B.L. Barlow P.W. Kirk D.L. Dictyostelium Evolution, Cell Biology, and the Development of Multicellularity. Cambridge University Press, New York2001Crossref Google Scholar and 8Varnum-Finney B. Edwards K.B. Voss E. Soll D.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskelet. 1987; 8: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The cAMP pulses also regulate the expression of many genes specifically expressed during early development (for review see Ref. 9Verkerke-van Wijk I. Schaap P. Maeda Y. Inouye K. Takeuchi I. Dictyostelium: A Model System for Cell and Developmental Biology. Universal Academy Press, Tokyo, Japan1997: 145-162Google Scholar). A rapid cGMP pulse is also generated in response to a cAMP pulse (9Verkerke-van Wijk I. Schaap P. Maeda Y. Inouye K. Takeuchi I. Dictyostelium: A Model System for Cell and Developmental Biology. Universal Academy Press, Tokyo, Japan1997: 145-162Google Scholar, 10Ma H. Gamper M. Parent C. Firtel R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4317-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The aggregating cells produce a fruiting body consisting of a spore mass held atop a rigid stem of stalk cells. When a fruiting body is too small, the spore mass will be too close to the ground for optimal spore dispersal. If a spore mass is too big, it will slide down the stalk or the fruiting body will fall over. Therefore, the formation of an optimal size spore mass and stalk is of utmost importance (for review see Ref. 11Brown J.M. Firtel R.A. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 191-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). One of the ways in which an upper limit to fruiting body size is established is by breaking up large aggregation streams into groups of ∼2 × 104 cells, with each group developing into a fruiting body (12Shaffer B.M. Q. J. Microsc. Sci. 1957; 98: 393-405Google Scholar). A secreted protein complex regulates stream breakup and thus group size. Wild-type cells secrete this protein complex, named counting factor (CF),1 at a moderate level. Disruption of the smlA gene leads to the oversecretion of CF, resulting in the formation of much smaller groups than wild type (13Brock D.A. Buczynski F. Spann T.P. Wood S.A. Cardelli J. Gomer R.H. Development. 1996; 122: 2569-2578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In smlA − cells, the streams are severely fragmented, thereby forming large numbers of tiny fruiting bodies. The addition of purified CF to wild-type cells also decreases group size. CF seems to consist of at least five polypeptides, forming a complex of about 450 kDa. Two of these polypeptides are countin and CF50. When the countin orcf50 genes are disrupted, the cells secrete very little detectable CF activity (14Brock D.A. Gomer R.H. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1960-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 15Brock D.A. Hatton R.D. Giurgiutiu D.-V. Scott B. Ammann R. Gomer R.H.

We used Monte Carlo simulations of streaming cells to model and test the effect of various parameters on stream breakup. The simulations indicated that group size increases with the ratio of adhesion force to motility force (16Roisin-Bouffay C. Jang W. Gomer R.H. Mol.

One of the major adhesion molecules utilized during early development is gp24 (18Loomis W.F. Dev.

Jang W. Gomer R.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). CF also decreases group size by increasing the amount of polymerized actin (F-actin) and decreasing the amount of polymerized myosin II, which in turn increases the motility of cells (17Tang L. Gao T. McCollum C. Jang W. Vickers M.G. Ammann R. Gomer R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1371-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, CF down-regulates the cAMP-induced cGMP pulse and up-regulates the cAMP-induced cAMP pulse (19Tang L. Ammann R. Gao T. Gomer R.H. J. Biol.

We investigated the role of DEP extract and associated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on prostaglandin synthesis in endotoxin-activated murine macrophages and in mitogen-stimulated fibroblasts. In both macrophages and fibroblasts, DEP extract, phenanthrene, anthracene, phenanthrenequinone, and β-napthoflavone inhibit prostaglandin production from endogenous arachidonic acid in response to ligand stimulation. However, DEP extract and PAHs do not block ligand induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein, either in mitogen-stimulated fibroblasts or endotoxin-treated macrophages. Release of total arachidonic acid and total lipid products is not reduced by DEP or PAHs following ligand stimulation of macrophages or fibroblasts. DEP extract and the PAHs inhibit the activity of purified COX-2 enzyme in vitro but do not inhibit COX-1 activity. Thus, DEP and PAHs do not affect ligand-induced COX-2 gene expression, phospholipase activation, or arachidonic acid release in macrophages and fibroblasts but exert their inhibitory effect on prostaglandin production by preferentially blocking COX-2 enzyme activity.

Diesel exhaust particles (DEP)1 account for a significant percentage of the suspended particulate matter in the atmosphere. DEP consist of an inert carbonaceous core and a wide variety of organic compounds composed of unburned petrochemicals that include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, and redox-active quinones (2Hiura T.S. Kaszubowski M.P., Li, N. Nel A.E. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5582-5591PubMed Google Scholar). Phenanthrene (PE) is a major constituent of DEP comprising 6% of the total organic extract; as a family, PEs constitutes 52% of the total PAH found in DEP (3Tsien A. Diaz-Sanchez D., Ma, J. Saxon A. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 142: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). DEP can cause asthma-like conditions such as infiltration of inflammatory cells, proliferating goblet cells, increased mucus secretion, respiratory resistance, and airway constriction (4Sagai M.

Penichet-Garcia M. Saxon A. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2000; 106: 1140-1146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). DEP have the ability to induce IgE responses, either by acting directly on B-cells or indirectly by enhancing cytokine production. By both initiating and enhancing IgE production, DEP may be of importance in the increased incidence of allergic airway disease (6DiazSanchez D. Allergy (Cph.). 1997; 52: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). DEP-stimulated human airway epithelial cells release inflammatory cytokines and mediators such as IL-6, IL-8, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and the soluble form of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1)in vitro (7Kawasaki S. Takizawa H. Takami K. Desaki M. Okazaki H. Kasama T. Kobayashi K. Yamamoto K. Nakahara K. Tanaka M. Sagai M. Ohtoshi T. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 24: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). ICAM-1 has been suggested to play a critical role in the attachment and migration of immune inflammatory cells to airway mucosa (8Takizawa H. Abe S. Ohtoshi T. Kawasaki S. Takami K. Desaki M. Sugawara I. Hashimoto S. Azuma A. Nakahara K. Kudoh S. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2000; 120: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Among the other cell types involved in allergic inflammation, DEP also affect the functions of macrophages, eosinophils, epithelial cells, and mast cells (2Hiura T.S. Kaszubowski M.P., Li, N. Nel A.E. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5582-5591PubMed Google Scholar). DEP also act as adjuvant, enhancing mucosal immune responses to other agents (9Nel A.E. Diaz-Sanchez D., Ng, D. Hiura T. Saxon A. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1998; 102: 539-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). PE and anthracene (ANT), both components of DEP, also enhance antigen-specific IgE and IgG1 production (10Heo Y. Saxon A. Hankinson O. Toxicology. 2001; 159: 143-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In 1977, Levine and Hong (11Levine L. Hong S.L. Prostaglandins. 1977; 14: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) reported that PE, ANT, and benzoflavone blocked prostaglandin production from transformed mouse and human fibroblasts and canine kidney cells. The committed step in prostaglandin biosynthesis, the conversion of free arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), is catalyzed by the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme(s). PGH2 is subsequently converted to a variety of eicosanoids depending on the cell-specific expression of alternative enzymes that utilize PGH2 as substrate. Two isoforms of COX exist (12Herschman H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). COX-1 is constitutively expressed in most cell types and is responsible for “housekeeping functions.” COX-2 is normally undetectable in most tissues but can be induced in many different cell types by a wide variety of stimuli that include proinflammatory and mitogenic agents (12Herschman H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). Prostaglandins promote inflammation by increasing vascular permeability (13Williams T.J. Morley J. Nature. 1973; 246: 215-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) and vasodilatation (14Fletcher J.R. Arch. Surg. 1993; 128: 1192-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and by directing cellular migration into the site of inflammation through prostaglandin-mediated production and release of proinflammatory cytokines (15Williams J.A. Shacter E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25693-25699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs block the ability of the cyclooxygenases to convert arachidonic acid to PGH2. Exposure to indomethecin, a classic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug inhibitor of both COX-1 and COX-2, during airway sensitization exacerbates allergic airway inflammation in ovalbumin (OA)-sensitized mice (16Peebles Jr., R.S. Dworski R. Collins R.D. Jarzecka K. Mitchell D.B. Graham B.S. Sheller J.R. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 162: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Allergic lung responses are also exacerbated in COX-1- and COX-2-deficient mice using a similar OA immunization/challenge model (17Gavett S.H. Madison S.L. Chulada P.C. Scarborough P.E., Qu, W. Boyle J.E. Tiano H.F. Lee C.A. Langenbach R. Roggli V.L. Zeldin D.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Thus, both pharmacologic (16Peebles Jr., R.S. Dworski R. Collins R.D. Jarzecka K. Mitchell D.B. Graham B.S. Sheller J.R. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 162: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and genetic (17Gavett S.H. Madison S.L. Chulada P.C. Scarborough P.E., Qu, W. Boyle J.E. Tiano H.F. Lee C.A. Langenbach R. Roggli V.L. Zeldin D.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) studies suggest that endogenous COX products might limit allergic lung inflammation and that inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity might exacerbate allergic lung responses. The observation that PE and ANT can block prostaglandin synthesis in transformed fibroblasts (11Levine L. Hong S.L. Prostaglandins. 1977; 14: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) was reported long before the discovery of COX-2. We thought it possible that one mechanism by which DEP exacerbates allergic airway inflammatory responses might be via the modulation of prostaglandin production. In the present study, we investigate the effects of DEP extract and a number of PAHs on prostaglandin synthesis, COX-2 expression, and cyclooxygenase activity in unstimulated and ligand-stimulated murine fibroblasts and macrophages. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and phosphate-buffered saline were supplied by Invitrogen. PE, phenanthrenequinone (PQ), ANT, β-napthoflavone (BNF), bovine serum albumin, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), hematin, and iodine crystals were from Sigma. Arachidonic acid, PGE2, PGF2α, ovine COX-1, ovine COX-2, and polyclonal rabbit anti-COX-2 antibody were purchased from Cayman Chemicals. The screening kit for COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors (the colorimetric COX (ovine) screening assay kit) and the COX-2- and COX-1-specific inhibitors DuP-697 and SC-560 were also purchased from Cayman Chemicals. NS-398 was from Biomol. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB was from R&D Chemicals. [3H]Arachidonic acid (80 Ci/mm) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Phenol and silica gel TLC plates were purchased from EM Sciences. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits for PGE2 assay and ECL reagent were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The polyclonal anti-14–3-3 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. DEP extract was supplied by Dr. Andre Nel (UCLA) (2Hiura T.S. Kaszubowski M.P., Li, N. Nel A.E. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5582-5591PubMed Google Scholar). RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cells were maintained in endotoxin-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in 5% CO2as described previously (18Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15473-15480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in 5% CO2 as described previously (19Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). PE, PQ, ANT, BNF, and DEP extract were dissolved in Me2SO. Before use, the chemicals were diluted in culture medium to the indicated concentrations. The final Me2SO concentration in culture medium was 0.005%. LPS was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline and added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 10 ng/ml. PDGF was prepared in 4 mm HCl and diluted with medium to a final concentration of 10 ng/ml. RAW 264.7 macrophages or NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were plated in 12-well culture plates (1 × 104 cells/well). The following day, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and shifted to medium containing 0.5% serum overnight. Cells were treated with inducers and PAHs or DEP extract concurrently and incubated for 6 h as indicated in individual experiments. The supernatants were collected and assayed for PGE2 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (18Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15473-15480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the end of experiments, RAW 264.7 macrophages and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega). Cell extracts were subjected to electrophoresis, and Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (18Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15473-15480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose membrane was incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-COX-2 antibody or anti-14–3-3 antibody, used at 1:1000 dilutions, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody at 1:4000 dilutions and developed with ECL chemiluminescence reagents. RAW 264.7 macrophages and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were plated in 6-well culture plates. The following day, cells were labeled with [3H]arachidonic acid (1.5 μCi/well). Forty-eight h later, the cultures were washed and treated with the PAHs or with DEP extract along with inducing ligands in medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Six h later, lipids were extracted from cell culture media and analyzed, as described previously (18Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15473-15480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Butler-Gralla E. Taplitz S. Herschman H.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 111: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), for total arachidonic acid-derived products, arachidonic acid, and prostaglandins. Briefly, total radioactivity in a portion of each lipid sample was determined to measure total arachidonic acid-derived products. Samples of the isolated lipids were spotted on TLC plates, and chromatography was performed in a solvent system containing CHCl3:MeOH:acetic acid:H2O at 90:8:1:0.8. A mixture of lipid standards was run and visualized with iodine vapor. Spots corresponding to arachidonic acid, PGE2, and PGF2α were collected, and radioactivity was determined in a scintillation counter. The ability of DEP and the PAHs to inhibit COX-1 and COX-2 enzyme activity was first examined using the Cayman COX-1 and COX-2 colorimetic screening kit. This assay analyzes the peroxidase activity of the enzymes usingN,N,N′,N′-tetramethylphenylenediamine as the reducing co-substrate. The kit includes purified ovine COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. SC-560 was used as the positive control for COX-1 inhibition; DuP-697 was used as the positive control for COX-2 inhibition. The DEP and PAHs were dissolved in Me2SO and diluted in the assay buffer before use. The assays were run according to the manufacturer's instructions. The effect of DEP and the PAHs on the bisoxygenase reaction of COX-1 and COX-2 was also assayed by measuring oxygen consumption with a polarographic electrode (21Korge P. Honda H.M. Weiss J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3312-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) Cyclooxygenase activity was measured by monitoring O2 consumption in a fiber optic spectrofluorimeter using a Foxy AL-300 probe (Ocean Optics, Dundein, FL). Purified COX-1 or COX-2 enzymes (60 units) were incubated with the presumptive inhibitors for 10 min at 37 °C. Reactions were initiated by the addition of the enzyme/inhibitor mixture and arachidonic acid (to a final concentration of 100 μm) to the reaction buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenol, 1 μm hematin) (22Johnson J.L. Wimsatt J. Buckel S.D. Dyer R.D. Maddipati K.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 324: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 23Capdevila J.H. Morrow J.D. Belosludtsev Y.Y. Beauchamp D.R. DuBois R.N. Falck J.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3325-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). O2 consumption was continuously measured; initial slopes were used to determine the rate of oxygen consumption. SC-560 was used as the positive inhibitor control for COX-1 and NS-398 as the positive inhibitor control for COX-2. Macrophages are one of the key players in airway allergic responses (24Ng D. Kokot N. Hiura T. Faris M. Saxon A. Nel A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 942-951PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, we first examined the effect of DEP extract on prostaglandin production in murine macrophages. RAW 264.7 macrophages were treated with LPS (10 ng/ml). A concentration series of DEP extract was added along with LPS. After 6 h, medium samples were collected and assayed for PGE2. A 50% reduction in LPS-induced prostaglandin synthesis was observed with 50 ng/ml DEP (Fig.1 A). Vehicle (Me2SO) had no inhibitory effect on prostaglandin synthesis (data not shown). Phenanthrene is one of the major components of DEP extract (25Peterson B. Saxon A. Ann. Allergy Asthma Immunol. 1996; 77 (; quiz 269–270): 263-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We next examined the effect of PE on prostaglandin production in RAW 264.7 macrophages. The cells were treated with LPS (10 ng/ml) in the presence of increasing concentrations of PE (10–250 nm). After 6 h, medium samples were collected and analyzed for PGE2 production. PE is an effective inhibitor of endotoxin-induced PGE2 accumulation (Fig.1 B); 50% inhibition of endotoxin-induced PGE2accumulation occurs between 50 and 100 nm PE. A variety of other PAHs are also present in DEP extracts (3Tsien A. Diaz-Sanchez D., Ma, J. Saxon A. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 142: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We compared PQ, ANT, and BNF with PE to determine the relative efficacy of various PAHs for inhibition of prostaglandin induction in endotoxin-treated macrophages. RAW 264.7 macrophages were treated with 100 nm of each PAH along with endotoxin (10 ng/ml). At the end of 6 h of incubation, the supernatants were collected for PGE2 assay. Each PAH is an effective inhibitor of endotoxin-stimulated PGE2 production in RAW 264.7 macrophages (Fig. 1 C). Dose-response curves suggest that PQ may be a slightly better inhibitor than the other PAHs (data not shown), but differences in inhibitory activity among the various PAHs are not striking. Prostaglandin production in response to ligand stimulation is usually dependent on COX-2 induction (12Herschman H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar, 26Herschman H.R. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1998; 8: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The induction pathway leading to COX-2 expression is similar in fibroblasts (27Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31742-31748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), mast cells (28Reddy S.T. Wadleigh D.J. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3107-3113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and osteoblasts (29Wadleigh D.J. Herschman H.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) but differs from these cell types in endotoxin-stimulated macrophages (30Wadleigh D.J. Reddy S.T. Kopp E. Ghosh S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6259-6266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). To determine whether the inhibition of prostaglandin production by DEP extract and PAHs is unique to ligand-stimulated macrophages, we examined the induction of PGE2 in mitogen-treated fibroblasts. Quiescent, non-dividing NIH 3T3 cells were induced with PDGF (10 ng/ml) in the presence of increasing concentrations of DEP extract. As observed for macrophages, DEP extract effectively blocks ligand-induced prostaglandin production in mitogen-stimulated fibroblasts (Fig.2 A). PE (Fig. 2 B) and other PAHs (PQ, BNF, ANT; Fig. 2 C) are also potent inhibitors of PDGF-induced PGE2 accumulation in fibroblasts. DEP and extracts of these particles are able to regulate the expression of a number of genes (31Reynolds L.J. Richards R.J. Toxicology. 2001; 165: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Ligand-induced expression of COX-2 message and protein are necessary for both endotoxin-induced PGE2 synthesis in macrophages and mitogen-stimulated PGE2 production in fibroblasts (18Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15473-15480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One possible mechanism by which DEP extract and PAHs block prostaglandin production in ligand-treated cells might, therefore, be by preventing the induction of COX-2 mRNA or protein expression. RAW 264.7 macrophages were treated with LPS (10 ng/ml), and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were treated with PDGF (10 ng/ml). For each cell type, various concentrations of either DEP extract or PE were added concomitantly with the inducer. After 6 h, cells were harvested, and protein extracts were analyzed by Western blot for COX-2 expression in macrophages (Fig. 3, upper panel) and in fibroblasts (Fig. 3, lower panel). Surprisingly, at all concentrations tested, neither DEP nor PE had any effect on COX-2 expression. Thus, PE and DEP must inhibit ligand-stimulated prostaglandin production, both in macrophages and in fibroblasts, by a mechanism that does not interfere with COX-2 gene expression. DEP and PE, by themselves, did not induce COX-2 expression in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts or RAW 264.7 macrophage (data not shown). DEP extract and PAHs inhibit ligand-induced prostaglandin production in macrophages and fibroblasts but do not inhibit ligand-induced COX-2 induction. DEP extract and PAHs may also influence mitogen-induced or endotoxin-stimulated arachidonic acid release from endogenous stores. To investigate this possibility, we measured total arachidonic acid-derived lipid release, free arachidonic acid release, PGE2 production, and PGF2α production from cellular phospholipid pools in which the arachidonic acid was radioactively labeled. RAW 264.7 macrophages and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts membrane phospholipids were labeled with [3H]arachidonic acid (18Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15473-15480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were then treated with ligand (LPS or PDGF, respectively) and DEP extract or PAHs. Lipids were subsequently extracted from the media, and the amounts of radioactive total lipids, arachidonic acid, PGE2, and PGF2α present in the media were determined by TLC. Total radioactive lipid release in response to ligand stimulation was unaffected by the presence of either DEP extract or any of the PAHs tested (Fig. 4). DEP extract and PAHs modestly increased the level of arachidonic acid found in the medium of ligand-stimulated macrophages and fibroblasts (Fig. 5). Clearly, DEP extract and PAHs do not prevent phospholipase activation and arachidonic acid release in endotoxin-treated macrophages or mitogen-stimulated fibroblasts.Figure 5DEP extract and PAHs do not block arachidonic acid release from LPS-treated RAW 264.7 macrophages or PDGF-stimulated NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. In A and B, RAW 264.7 cells were labeled with [3H]arachidonic acid as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After washing, the cells were treated with LPS (10 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of DEP extract (100 nm) or PQ (100 nm). After 6 h, lipids were extracted from the medium, and radioactive arachidonic acid was measured by TLC as described previously (18Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15473-15480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Butler-Gralla E. Taplitz S. Herschman H.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 111: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In C andD, NIH 3T3 cells were labeled with [3H]arachidonic acid. After washing, the cells were treated with PDGF (10 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of PE (100 nm) or BNF (100 nm). After 6 h, lipids were extracted from the medium, and radioactive arachidonic acid was measured. Data are the averages ± S.D. from triplicate experiments and are expressed as the percentage of arachidonic acid released by treatment with ligand in the presence of either DEP or the respective PAH compound.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Ligand-stimulated production of both radioactive PGE2 and PGF2α could also be demonstrated by TLC of media collected from the endotoxin-treated macrophages and PDGF-treated fibroblasts (data not shown). The presence of DEP extract or PAHs reduced the production of radioactive PGE2 and PGF2α. The inhibition in PGE2 synthesis from endogenous radioactive arachidonic acid stores, determined by TLC of radioactive lipids, is consistent with the observations made using the PGE2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Figs. 1 and 2). The inhibition of PGF2α production suggests that it is COX-2 inhibition, and not inhibition of PGE2 synthase, that is responsible for the inhibition of prostaglandin accumulation by DEP and the PAHs. DEP extract and PAHs block ligand-induced prostaglandin synthesis in macrophages and fibroblasts but do not prevent COX-2 induction or arachidonic acid release. The simplest explanation to account for inhibition of COX-2-dependent prostaglandin production by DEP and PAHs in ligand-treated macrophages and fibroblasts would be that these compounds directly inhibit the COX-2 enzymatic activity. Purified ovine COX-1 and COX-2 were used to determine whether DEP extract and the PAHs could directly inhibit the activity of these enzymes in vitro. We first examined the peroxidase activity of COX-1 and COX-2 in the presence of a COX-1 inhibitor, a COX-2 inhibitor, DEP, and several PAHs. In control experiments, DuP-697 inhibited COX-2 activity (IC50 of ∼80 nm) but had no effect on COX-1 activity, even at 400 nm (Fig.6). In contrast, SC-560 inhibited COX-1 activity (IC50 of ∼15 nm) but was unable, even at 50 nm, to inhibit COX-2. The inhibitory activity of DEP extract was examined over a 10–500 ng/ml concentration range. The inhibitory activities of the PAHs were examined over concentration ranges of 10–400 nm. DEP and the PAHs (PE, BNF, and ANT) used in this study all inhibit the peroxidase enzymatic activity of purified COX-2 but have no effect on COX-1 activity. The IC50 values for COX-2 peroxidase inhibition by DEP, PE, BNF, and ANT are 110 ng/ml, 130 nm, 160 nm, and 195 nm, respectively. In summary, DEP and associated PAHs inhibit COX-2 peroxidase enzymatic activity but have no effect on COX-1 peroxidase activity at comparable and higher concentrations. It is possible that DEP and the PAHs might inhibit the oxidation of the peroxidase substrates directly or indirectly inhibit cyclooxygenase activity by preventing oxidative activation of the COX-2 enzyme. Consequently, we also assessed the effect of DEP and the PAHs on the bisoxygenase reaction of COX-1 and COX-2 by measuring oxygen consumption with a polarographic electrode (22Johnson J.L. Wimsatt J. Buckel S.D. Dyer R.D. Maddipati K.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 324: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 23Capdevila J.H. Morrow J.D. Belosludtsev Y.Y. Beauchamp D.R. DuBois R.N. Falck J.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3325-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The COX-1 inhibitor SC-560 inhibits COX-1 cyclooxygenase activity ∼70% at 200 nm concentration but has no inhibitory effect on COX-2 activity (Fig. 7). Similarly, the COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 (500 nm) inhibits COX-2 cyclooxygenase activity ∼60% but has no effect on COX-1 enzyme activity. DEP extract (500 ng/ml) and PE (500 nm) do not inhibit COX-1 bisoxygenase enzyme activity. In contrast, both DEP extract and PE, at these same concentrations, effectively inhibit COX-2 cyclooxygenase activity. In summary, using assays for both the peroxidase activity and the bisoxygenase activity of COX-1 and COX-2, DEP extract and PE are preferential inhibitors of purified COX-2 and demonstrate little, if any, inhibition of COX-1 enzyme activity. Diesel exhaust particles are one of the major air pollutants in urban areas. DEP can reach the pulmonary alveoli during inhalation of contaminated air and cause pulmonary tumors, edematous change, focal chronic alveolitis, and allergic airway disorders in experimental animals (32Han J.Y. Takeshita K. Utsumi H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 516-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Sagai and co-workers (4Sagai M. Furuyama A. Ichinose T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 33Takano H. Yoshikawa T. Ichinose T. Miyabara Y. Imaoka K. Sagai M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1997; 156: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) have demonstrated increased allergic airway hyperreactivity responses in mice challenged with OA in the presence of either intratrachially administered DEP (4Sagai M. Furuyama A. Ichinose T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) or inhaled DEP (33Takano H. Yoshikawa T. Ichinose T. Miyabara Y. Imaoka K. Sagai M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1997; 156: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). DEP may participate in allergic inflammatory processes by increasing production of both IgE and TH2 cytokines in both humans and animals challenged by allergens (34Salvi S.S. Frew A. Holgate S. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 1999; 29: 4-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition, production of reactive oxygen species has been proposed to play a role in the activity of DEP and their PAH constituents in airway allergic adjuvant responses (35Hiura T.S., Li, N. Kaplan R. Horwitz M. Seagrave J.C. Nel A.E. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2703-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Macrophages are likely to be involved in the adjuvant activity of DEP since DEP can increase CD86 expression in macrophages both in vivo and in vitro (9Nel A.E. Diaz-Sanchez D., Ng, D. Hiura T. Saxon A. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1998; 102: 539-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). As a long term effect of this adjuvant action on airway hyperreactivity, DEP may play a role in the increased prevalence of asthma as observed in Japan (36Miyamoto T. Allergy. 1997; 52: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and other industrialized environments. Recent studies with murine models suggest that eicosanoids may play a substantive role in modulating allergic airway inflammation. 5-lipoxygenase knockout mice demonstrate reduced airway hyperresponsiveness and eosinophil infiltration in allergen-induced airway inflammation (37Irvin C.G., Tu, Y.P. Sheller J.R. Funk C.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L1053-L1058PubMed Google Scholar). These data are not surprising given the powerful beneficial effects of leukotriene inhibitors and leukotriene receptor antagonists in allergic airway disease. Peebles et al. (16Peebles Jr., R.S. Dworski R. Collins R.D. Jarzecka K. Mitchell D.B. Graham B.S. Sheller J.R. Am. J. Respir. Crit.

PGE2 levels in lung lavages were reduced, and leukotriene levels were elevated. Both IL-5 and IL-13 levels were increased in lung extracts following OA aerosol treatment in the presence of indomethacin, suggesting that inhibition of prostaglandin production results in an elevated allergic response. Methacholine challenge of indomethacin-treated mice in this OA sensitization/inhalation protocol produced significantly greater airway hyperresponsiveness than in control animals. Using the same animal model, both COX-1- and COX-2-deficient mice also demonstrate an exacerbated allergic lung response (e.g. lung histopathology and decreased respiratory compliance) (17Gavett S.H. Madison S.L. Chulada P.C. Scarborough P.E., Qu, W. Boyle J.E. Tiano H.F. Lee C.A. Langenbach R. Roggli V.L. Zeldin D.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrating that DEP extract and several of its organic components can prevent COX-2-dependent prostaglandin production in activated macrophages is consistent with the idea that COX-2 products may limit allergic lung inflammation. Moreover, shunting of arachidonic acid released by ligand stimulation in the presence of DEP components may shift eicosanoid metabolism toward leukotriene production in appropriate cells (e.g. mast cells, endothelial cells), provoking increased airway hyperreactivity. It seems likely that modulation of eicosanoid activity may be an additional important mechanism by which DEP and their constituents modify airway inflammation. DEP, DEP extract, and several of the PAH components of DEP extract can modulate the expression of a variety of genes. Probably the most well studied is IgE. Both DEP extracts and phenanthrene can enhance IgE production directly in B-cells (3Tsien A. Diaz-Sanchez D., Ma, J. Saxon A. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 142: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 38Takenaka H. Zhang K. Diaz-Sanchez D. Tsien A. Saxon A. J. Allergy Clin.

Tadokoro K. Miyamoto T. Ikemori R. Muranaka M. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1987; 79: 639-645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). DEP, organic extracts of DEP, and benzo[α]pyrene (B[α]P) can induce IL-8 expression in epithelial cells (7Kawasaki S. Takizawa H. Takami K. Desaki M. Okazaki H. Kasama T. Kobayashi K. Yamamoto K. Nakahara K. Tanaka M. Sagai M. Ohtoshi T. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 24: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Heme oxygenase-1 can be induced in RAW 264.7 cells, the same macrophage cell line we use in these studies, by DEP extract and by aromatic and polar DEP fractions (41Li N. Venkatesan M.I. Miguel A. Kaplan R. Gujuluva C. Alam J. Nel A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3393-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In a recent microarray analysis, 207 arrayed stress-induced genes were surveyed with cDNAs prepared from lungs of control rats and lungs from rats instilled with DEP. The expression of at least eight genes, including cyclin D1, MAPKAP2, and the multidrug resistance gene, were significantly associated with DEP exposure (31Reynolds L.J. Richards R.J. Toxicology. 2001; 165: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Given the prior literature demonstrating the effects of DEP and its components on gene expression (see above), the regulatory characteristics of the COX-2 gene, and our observation that DEP and associated PAHs can block ligand-induced prostaglandin synthesis in fibroblasts and macrophages, we thought that DEP and the various PAHs might inhibit COX-2-dependent prostaglandin production in endotoxin-treated macrophages and mitogen-treated fibroblasts by regulating COX-2 gene expression. Surprisingly, however, neither PDGF- nor LPS-induced COX-2 expression is at all modulated by DEP or the component PAHs. Moreover, the effects of DEP extract and PAHs on prostaglandin production in stimulated fibroblasts and macrophages are in the nanomolar range, whereas micromolar PAH concentrations are required to modulate gene expression in many of the systems discussed above. Although Levine and Hong (11Levine L. Hong S.L. Prostaglandins. 1977; 14: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) reported that a number of PAH compounds could inhibit prostaglandin production by transformed fibroblasts, B[α]P is able to induce COX-2 expression in several contexts (42Yan Z. Subbaramaiah K. Camilli T. Zhang F. Tanabe T. McCaffrey T.A. Dannenberg A.J. Weksler B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4949-4955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar,43Kelley D.J. Mestre J.R. Subbaramaiah K. Sacks P.G. Schantz S.P. Tanabe T. Inoue H. Ramonetti J.T. Dannenberg A.J. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 795-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Because of these disparate reports, we analyzed the ability of B[α]P to modulate COX-2 gene expression in murine NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and RAW 264.7 macrophages. Using B[α]P concentrations described by Yan et al. (42Yan Z. Subbaramaiah K. Camilli T. Zhang F. Tanabe T. McCaffrey T.A. Dannenberg A.J. Weksler B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4949-4955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), we observed no induction of COX-2 gene expression (assayed by Western blotting) in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts or RAW 264.7 macrophages. Nor did B[α]P modulate the COX-2 induction ability of PDGF or LPS in these respective cell types. Activation of MAP kinase, as measured by phosphorylation, was observed in PDGF-treated NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, demonstrating the biological activity of the B[α]P preparation used in our experiments (data not shown). We also confirmed the biological activity of the B[α]P preparation used in these experiments by demonstrating p53 induction in A549 cells, as described by Pei et al. (44Pei X.H. Nakanishi Y. Takayama K. Bai F. Hara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35240-35246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Differences in the target cell type may explain the difference in COX-2 induction we observe for fibroblasts and macrophagesversus the observations in vascular smooth muscle cells (42Yan Z. Subbaramaiah K. Camilli T. Zhang F. Tanabe T. McCaffrey T.A. Dannenberg A.J. Weksler B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4949-4955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and oral epithelial cells (43Kelley D.J. Mestre J.R. Subbaramaiah K. Sacks P.G. Schantz S.P. Tanabe T. Inoue H. Ramonetti J.T. Dannenberg A.J. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 795-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To block ligand-induced prostaglandin synthesis in macrophages and fibroblasts, DEP and its constituents must inhibit some component other than induced COX-2 gene expression. Our dose-response studies suggested that it is COX-2-dependent prostaglandin synthesis that is blocked by DEP/PAHs; the level of inhibition of PGE2production never falls below the unstimulated control. Prostaglandin production from unstimulated macrophages and fibroblasts is unaltered by DEP/PAHs, both from endogenous and exogenous arachidonic acid (data not shown), suggesting that these agents do not affect COX-1-dependent prostaglandin synthesis. These suggestions were confirmed by in vitro analysis of the effects of DEP and the PAHs on both the peroxidase and bisoxygenase enzyme activities of purified COX-1 and COX-2; these compounds are preferentially able to inhibit the enzymatic activity of COX-2 versus COX-1. DEP extract/PAHs do not block ligand-stimulated arachidonic acid release from membrane phospholipids, suggesting that the mechanism by which these agents inhibit ligand-induced, COX-2-dependent prostaglandin production is predominately due to their ability to inhibit COX-2 enzyme activity. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, either by interfering with phospholipase-mediated release of membrane-bound arachidonic acid or by interfering with COX-mediated conversion of free arachidonic acid to prostaglandin, is a major target for pharmacological research. The classic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin, indomethecin, and ibuprofen inhibit the enzymatic activity of both COX-1 and COX-2. The new class of COX-2-specific inhibitors,e.g. NS-398 (12Herschman H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar), celecoxib (Celebrex) (45Goldenberg M.M. Clin. Ther. 1999; 21: 1497-1513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and rofecoxib (Vioxx) (46Ehrich E.W. Dallob A., De Lepeleire I. Van Hecken A. Riendeau D. Yuan W.Y. Porras A. Wittreich J. Seibold J.R., De Schepper P. Mehlisch D.R. Gertz B.J. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 65: 336-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), inhibit COX-2-dependent prostaglandin production but not COX-1-dependent prostaglandin production. To be effective, biologically active agents, PAHs usually require metabolic activation and often co-valently modify target proteins (47Marston C.P. Pereira C. Ferguson J. Fischer K. Hedstrom O. Dashwood W.M. Baird W.M. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 1077-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, we find that the COX-2 present in endotoxin-stimulated macrophages can convert exogenous arachidonic acid to PGE2 after washing away the inhibitory effect of DEP extract or PE (data not shown), suggesting that co-valent modification and irreversible inhibition of COX-2 may not be occurring with the PAHs. It will be of great interest to compare and contrast the mechanisms by which these PAHs and the new COX-2-specific pharmaceuticals inhibit COX-2 enzyme activity.
