They mainly consist of the amyloid peptide Aβ and display an abnormal content in Zn2+ ions, together with many truncated, isomerized, and racemized forms of Aβ. The region 1-16 of Aβ can be considered the minimal zinc-binding domain and contains two aspartates subject to protein aging. The influence of zinc binding and protein aging related modifications on the conformation of this region of Aβ is of importance given the potentiality of this domain to constitute a therapeutic target, especially for immunization approaches. In this study, we determined from NMR data the solution structure of the Aβ-(1-16)-Zn2+ complex in aqueous solution at pH 6.5. The residues His6, His13, and His14 and the Glu11 carboxylate were identified as ligands that tetrahedrally coordinate the Zn(II) cation. In vitro aging experiments on Aβ-(1-16) led to the formation of truncated and isomerized species. The major isomer generated, Aβ-(1-16)-l-iso-Asp7, displayed a local conformational change in the His6-Ser8 region but kept a zinc binding propensity via a coordination mode involving l-iso-Asp7. These results are discussed here with regard to Aβ fibrillogenesis and the potentiality of the region 1-16 of Aβ to be used as a therapeutic target.

The amyloid β-peptide (Aβ), the major component of these extracellular deposits, is a 39-43-amino acid peptide that results from the normal proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein. Considerable NMR data obtained on Aβ and on fragments argue that the soluble monomeric peptide is in an unordered conformation in aqueous solution and mainly adopts an α-helical structure in membrane-mimicking media (1Barrow C.J.

Biol. 2000; 130: 130-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). By contrast, the conformation of Aβ within amyloid fibrils consists mainly of a β-sheet structure (10Choo L.P. Wetzel D.L.

Nature. 2002; 416: 483-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), a transconformation toward β-sheet is assumed to trigger the abnormal fibrillar amyloid deposition associated with AD. The N-terminal region of Aβ has been shown to be flexible and accessible within amyloid fibrils (14Petkova A.T. Ishii Y. Balbach J.J. Antzutkin O.N. Leapman R.D. Delaglio F. Tycko R. Proc. Natl.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11757-11767Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Therefore, it constitutes an attractive therapeutic target, as illustrated by the ability of monoclonal antibodies directed toward this region to dissociate amyloid fibrils (16McLaurin J. Cecal R. Kierstead M.E. Tian X. Phinney A.L. Manea M. French J.E. Lambermon M.H. Darabie A.A. Brown M.E. Janus C. Chishti M.A. Horne P. Westaway D. Fraser P.E. Mount H.T. Przybylski M. St George-Hyslop P.

Imbalances in transition metal cations such as copper, zinc, and iron are assumed to contribute to Aβ deposition (18Bush A.I. Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 207-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). In particular, (i) Zn2+ ions have been shown to trigger Aβ aggregation (19Mantyh P.W.

Kesslak P.J. Danscher G. Frederickson C.J. Brain Res. 2000; 852: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). However, the role of zinc in amyloid deposition is subject to debate (24Cuajungco M.P. Faget K.Y. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2003; 41: 44-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 25Cuajungco M.P. Frederickson C.J. Bush A.I. Subcell. Biochem. 2005; 38: 235-254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as (i) Zn2+ ions induce the deposition of Aβ in the form of nonfibrillar aggregates (26Yoshiike Y. Tanemura K. Murayama O. Akagi T.

Peptides. 2002; 23: 1265-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and (ii) zinc has been shown to function as an antioxidant able to protect from extensive redox chemical reactions that contribute to AD-related oxidative stress (28Curtain C.C. Ali F. Volitakis I. Cherny R.A. Norton R.S. Beyreuther K. Barrow C.J. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Barnham K.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 12: 1161-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (3733) Google Scholar). The obligatory sequence involved in zinc binding has been mapped to the region 6-28 of Aβ (30Bush A.I. Pettingell Jr., W.H. de Paradis M. Tanzi R.E. Wasco W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26618-26621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the involvement of the His13 and His14 residues has been strongly suggested (31Liu S.T. Howlett G. Barrow C.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9373-9378Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 32Miura T. Suzuki K. Kohata N. Takeuchi H.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 6692-6698Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Because of marked aggregation of Aβ peptides or Aβ fragments in the presence of Zn2+, zinc-induced conformational switching has not yet been characterized. However, using Aβ-(1-16), a synthetic peptide spanning the amino acid sequence between the α- and β-secretase cleavage sites, we showed in our initial CD study that this fragment of Aβ selectively bound Zn2+ to form a 1:1 complex soluble in physiologically relevant conditions and subsequently underwent a conformational change (34Kozin S.A. Zirah S. Rebuffat S. Hoa G.H. Debey P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 959-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We proposed a model of zinc attachment that involved the three histidines, His6, His13, and His14, and hypothesized Arg5 as the fourth coordination ligand from the analysis of the Aβ-(1-16)-Zn2+ 1:1 complex in the gas phase by electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) (35Zirah S. Rebuffat S. Kozin S.A. Debey P. Fournier F. Lesage D. Tabet J.C. Int. J. Mass Spectrom. 2003; 228: 999-1016Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recently, the zinc binding property of Aβ-(1-16) was studied by Mekmouche et al. (36Mekmouche Y. Coppel Y. Hochgrafe K. Guilloreau L. Talmard C. Mazarguil H. Faller P. Chembiochem. 2005; 6: 1663-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and the apparent dissociation constant of the 1:1 complex was determined. In addition to its zinc binding propensity, the 1-16 N-terminal region of Aβ is subject to isomerization and racemization of the aspartate residues, which constitute very common types of aging-related protein damages. These chemical modifications occur through a common pathway involving a neutral cyclic succinimide intermediate (37Geiger T. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 785-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Stephenson R.C. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6164-6170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The potential contribution of such aspartyl modifications to Aβ amyloidosis has been addressed, because unusually high contents of racemized and isomerized Asp residues were found in Aβ isolated from amyloid deposits (39Roher A.E. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. Wolkow C. Wang R. Cotter R.J. Reardon I.M. Zurcher-Neely H.A. Heinrikson R.L. Ball M.J. Greenberg B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3072-3083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, these modifications were shown to be related to an increase in β-sheet content and to in vitro fibrillation (40Kuo Y.M. Webster S. Emmerling M.R. De Lima N. Roher A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1406: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 41Fabian H. Szendrei G.I. Mantsch H.H. Greenberg B.D. Otvos Jr., L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 959-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), leading to the protein aging hypothesis of AD (42Orpiszewski J. Schormann N. Kluve-Beckerman B. Liepnieks J.J. Benson M.D. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1255-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the assessment of plaque age by using antibodies targeting specifically a particular isomer of Aβ suggests that these modifications would occur rather after the amyloid deposition (43Fonseca M.I. Head E. Velazquez P. Cotman C.W. Tenner A.J. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 157: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of Aβ appears as an attractive therapeutic target, especially for active or passive immunization approaches. Indeed, only the antibodies raised against the N-terminal part of Aβ are able to reduce the plaque burden and restore cognitive deficits in the mice model of AD (16McLaurin J. Cecal R. Kierstead M.E. Tian X. Phinney A.L. Manea M. French J.E. Lambermon M.H. Darabie A.A. Brown M.E. Janus C. Chishti M.A. Horne P. Westaway D. Fraser P.E. Mount H.T. Przybylski M. St George-Hyslop P. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1263-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 44Frenkel D. Dewachter I. Van Leuven F. Solomon B. Vaccine. 2003; 21: 1060-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 45Chauhan N.B. Siegel G.J. Neurosci. Lett. 2005; 375: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, targeting this region should enable us to exert this effect without eliciting an inflammatory response, which had been critical in the first clinical tests of active immunization on humans (46Gelinas D.S. DaSilva K. Fenili D. St George-Hyslop P. McLaurin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14657-14662Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that Aβ-(1-16) zinc binding induces an agonist effect on the 4-10 epitope recognition by different monoclonal antibodies, suggesting a folding of the peptide that would render the epitope more accessible (47Zirah S. Stefanescu R. Manea M. Tian X. Cecal R. Kozin S.A. Debey P. Rebuffat S. Przybylski M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 321: 324-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Because clinical testing for passive immunization has started, it is of major importance to characterize the structural changes of the N-terminal region of Aβ upon zinc binding and protein aging-induced modifications. Here we used NMR and molecular modeling to determine the three-dimensional structure of the apoAβ-(1-16) and the Aβ-(1-16)-Zn2+ complex in aqueous solution at pH 6.5. Furthermore, we investigated the ability of Aβ-(1-16) to undergo protein aging-related modifications. In vitro aging experiments were performed on the synthetic peptide Aβ-(1-16) in the absence and in the presence of Zn2+ ions. The resultant species were isolated and identified, and the main isomers generated were analyzed by NMR. From our study, region 1-16 of Aβ would behave as an autonomous segment able to undergo both zinc binding-induced structuration and aging-related isomerizations. Synthetic Peptides—The synthetic peptides used throughout this study were purchased from Eurogentec (Angers, France) with a ≥95% purity checked by RP-HPLC and matrix-assisted desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Voyager-DEPro, Applied Biosystems, Courtaboeuf, France). Aβ-(1-16) (Ac-Asp-Ala-Glu-Phe-Arg5-His-Asp-Ser-Gly-Tyr10-Glu-Val-His-His-Glu15-Lys-NH2) was acetylated at the N terminus and amidated at the C terminus; Aβ-(1-16)hemi was nonacetylated at the N terminus and amidated at the C terminus; Aβ-(1-16)-l-iso-Asp7 was acetylated at the N terminus and amidated at the C terminus and contained one l-iso-Asp residue at position 7. NMR Spectroscopy—Aβ-(1-16) was dissolved either in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, or in Tris-d11/HCl 22.5 mm, pH 5.8, prepared in H2O/D2O (9:1) using MilliQ™ water samples (Millipore, Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, France). The pH was checked directly in the 5-mm Wilmad NMR tubes by using a Mettler Toledo U402-M3-S7/200 electrode. pH values were uncorrected for deuterium isotope effects. Samples for experiments in the presence of Zn2+ were prepared by adding a concentrated stock solution of the highest analytical grade ZnCl2 (Aldrich) in order to reach a Zn2+/peptide ratio of 1.5. The absence of pH variation upon zinc addition was checked. Alternatively, Aβ-(1-16) and Aβ-(1-16)-l-iso-Asp7 were analyzed at 3 mm in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, prepared in H2O/D2O (9:1). NMR experiments were carried out on AVANCE 400 and DMX 600 spectrometers (Bruker Biospin, Wissembourg, France) both equipped with shielded gradients z and set up with 1H broad band reverse gradient and triple resonance 1H-13C-15N gradient probe heads, respectively. Temperature was controlled with a BCU-05 refrigeration unit and a BVT 3000 control unit on both spectrometers. 1H and 13C chemical shifts were externally referenced to sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate. Conventional one- and two-dimensional experiments, one-dimensional 1H, 1H-1H DQF-COSY, TOCSY (using a spin-lock field produced by an MLEV-17 spin-locking sequence for a spin-lock time of 120 ms), NOESY (with mixing times of 100, 200, 300, and 400 ms), as well as natural abundance 1H-13C HSQC and HMBC (with long-range coupling evolution delays of 70 ms and 90 ms) were performed. Water suppression was achieved by means of either selective low power irradiation for the DQF-COSY experiment or pulsed field gradients in a water suppression by a gradient tailored excitation scheme included in the pulse sequences for both TOCSY and NOESY experiments. Data were processed on Silicon Graphics Indigo 2 XL or O2 workstations, using XWINNMR 3.1 and AURELIA software (Bruker Biospin, Wissembourg, France). The determination of temperature coefficients (Δδ/ΔTHN) was achieved for each sample from five series of 1H one-dimensional and TOCSY spectra recorded between 288 and 313 K. 3JHN-Hα coupling constants were determined from 1H one-dimensional and DQF-COSY spectra. The chemical shift deviations (CSD) were calculated for H-α and C-α atoms considering the reference chemical shifts proposed by Wishart et al. (48Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2024) Google Scholar, 49Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar) for each amino acid in random structure. The pKa values of the histidines were measured in the absence of Zn2+ ions by using 3.5 mm Aβ-(1-16) peptide solutions in 10 mm H2O/D2O (9:1) sodium phosphate buffer. The effects of pH on the proton chemical shifts of Aβ-(1-16) were determined from a series of 1H one-dimensional, TOCSY, and NOESY spectra recorded at different pH values ranging from 3.0 to 9.5 at 278 K. The pH values were adjusted before each NMR experiment, and the absence of pH variation over the period of acquisition was checked immediately after. The pKa values were determined by analyzing the pH titration curves by nonlinear least square fit to the equation δ = (δ1 + δ2 × 10(pH - pKa))/(1 + 10(pH - pKa)), where δ is the chemical shift of a resonance measured as a function of pH, and δ1 and δ2 are its chemical shifts at the lowest and highest pH values, respectively. This procedure was carried out using the software Curve Expert 1.3. The equation used derives from the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, assuming a rapid equilibrium between protonated and unprotonated forms (50Forman-Kay J.D. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3442-3452Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and considering a noninteracting model (51Perez-Canadillas J.M. Campos-Olivas R. Lacadena J. Martinez del Pozo A. Gavilanes J.G. Santoro J. Rico M. Bruix M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15865-15876Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Distance and Dihedral Angle Constraints—Distance constraints resulting from integrated NOESY spectra and ϕ dihedral angles derived from the 3JHN-Hα coupling constants using the Pardi relation (52Pardi A. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 741-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar) were used for structure calculation. The NOESY experiment with 200 ms of mixing time was selected for distance calculation to get rid of spin diffusion associated with T1 relaxation. A tolerance range of ±25% of the NMR-derived distances was used to define the upper and lower values of the constraints. Structure Calculation and Analysis—The three-dimensional structures of Aβ-(1-16) at pH 6.5 in the absence and in the presence of zinc were calculated using simulated annealing and energy minimization protocols in X-PLOR 3.851. Alternatively, the conformational calculations were performed with a general purpose internal coordinate molecular dynamics program ICMD (53Mazur A.K. Becker O.M. MacKerell Jr., A.D. Roux B. Watanabe M. Computational Biochemistry and Biophysics. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York2001: 115-131Google Scholar) by using the variable target function approach (54Braun W. Go N. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 186: 611-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) adopted for dynamics in the torsion angle space. The program ICMD was further used to calculate the three-dimensional structure of the Aβ-(1-16)-Zn2+ complex. The structures obtained from ICMD calculations are only presented here as final structures. The molecular dynamics calculations in X-PLOR 3.851 were performed with a target function similar to that used by Nilges et al. (55Nilges M. Gronenborn A.M. Brunger A.T. Clore G.M. Protein Eng. 1988; 2: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) and a force field adapted for NMR structure determination (parallhdg.pro and topallhdg.pro). When no stereospecific assignments could be made for methyl and methylene protons, the constraints were considered with an appropriate treatment in X-PLOR. Several rounds of structure calculation and assignment were performed to resolve ambiguities. Starting from an extended template structure, a set of 100 structures was calculated. A first phase of 400-ps dynamics (time step = 2 fs) at 1000 K was followed by 80-ps slow cooling step to 100 K (time step = 2 fs; temperature step = 20 K). A weak weight of the van der Waals repulsive term was used at high temperature in order to allow a large conformational sampling. Refinement of the structures was achieved by using the conjugate gradient Powell algorithm with 7000 cycles of energy minimization, using the CHARMM 22 force field (files topallh22x.pro and parallh22x.pro) (56Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (14019) Google Scholar). The ICMD program was used with the standard geometry of amino acids and peptide bonds and involved multiple cycles of simulated annealing starting from an arbitrary extended peptide conformation. The AMBER99 all-atom force field parameters (57Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. GouldIan R. Merz K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11640) Google Scholar) were applied, with nonbonded interactions truncated at 6 Å by a force-shift method to maintain reasonable atom-atom distances and avoid any bias from longer range interactions. The Aβ-(1-16) peptide was modeled with all torsion degrees of freedom. According to the variable target function principle (54Braun W. Go N. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 186: 611-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), all NOE-based distance constraints were first checked for the number of free torsions that separate every particular proton pair. The corresponding number is further referred to as torsion separation. The simulated annealing started from an arbitrary extended conformation obtained by an unrestrained MD simulation under high temperature (7000 K). At the beginning, only constraints of torsion separation one were applied. The following separation levels were added one by one in the course of the protocol when reasonable convergence was achieved for all previous torsion separation levels. As the ICMD protocol does not use pseudoatoms, instead all candidate proton pairs corresponding to a given resonance were analyzed from time to time, and the corresponding constraint was reassigned to the pair with the shortest distance in the current conformation. 4T. Malliavin et al., manuscript in preparation. The structure calculation of the Aβ-(1-16)-Zn2+ 1:1 complex was carried out using a strategy including two independent steps. In the first step, the structure of the polypeptide chain only was refined in calculations performed without explicit Zn2+ ion and without any assumption on zinc coordination. The second calculation step was used in order to obtain a specific peptide-zinc complex structure with a metal coordination geometry satisfying chemical requirements. The experimental set of constraints used in the first step was updated with additional distance and angle constraints that enforced a tetrahedral ligand coordination of the Zn2+ ion. To this end, we added four ambiguous constraints that linked the Zn2+ ion with all possible partners. These constraints were arbitrarily assigned the torsion separation one, and they were treated along with other constraints, as explained above. Their geometry was derived from zinc-binding sites of relevant high resolution x-ray structures available in the Protein Data Bank. The following atoms and groups present in the Aβ-(1-16) peptide were considered as potential zinc chelators: N-δ and/or N-ϵ atoms of His6, His13, and His14, O-δ1-O-δ2 atoms of Asp1 and Asp7, and O-ϵ1-O-ϵ2 atoms of Glu3 and Glu11. These Zn2+ ligand hypotheses were in agreement with those authorized by the NMR data obtained. The 2.0 Å harmonic distance constraints were applied for the distance between the Zn2+ ion and each of its four chelators. If one of the histidine nitrogens took part in the complex, the Zn2+ ion was kept in the plane of the imidazole ring and in the bissector plane of the corresponding nitrogen atom by using additional angle constraints. In this case the other nitrogen of the same imidazole ring was temporarily excluded from the list of possible chelators. In a similar way, an appropriate symmetrical orientation of Zn2+ with respect to the Asp and Glu carboxyl groups was ensured. The calculated conformers were analyzed using MOLMOL (58Koradi R.

Production of Aβ-(1-16) Modified Forms by in Vitro Aging—Aβ-(1-16) (50 μm or 1.50 mm) or Aβ-(1-16)hemi (50 μm) was incubated as described previously (38Stephenson R.C. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6164-6170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% NaN3 (w/v) either at 37 or 70 °C in the absence or presence of 1 mm EDTA. The in vitro aging experiments in the presence of zinc were conducted with the same protocol in the absence of EDTA and in the presence of ZnCl2 with a 1:5 peptide/zinc ratio. Reactions were stopped by freezing the samples at -20 °C. The modified peptide mixtures obtained were analyzed at different incubation times by RP-HPLC on a Shiseido C-18 Capcell Pack, 5 μm, 4.6 × 250-mm column from Interchim (Montluçon, France), using a linear gradient of 10-40% MeOH in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, at a flow-rate of 1 ml/min. Elution was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 226 nm. Molecular masses of the separated species were determined by liquid chromatography-MS using a Discovery®HS C-18, 3 μm, 2.1 × 150-mm analytical column (Supelco, St Quentin-Fallavier, France) coupled to an ESI-hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Q-STAR Pulsar, Applied Biosystems, Courtaboeuf, France). The separation was obtained with a linear gradient of 27-35% MeOH in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid over 40 min at a flow rate of 200 μl/min. The same aging protocol was used for the nonacetylated peptide Aβ-(1-16)hemi. The modified peptide mixtures resulting from the incubation were analyzed at different incubation times by RP-HPLC, as described above, using a linear gradient of 13-18% ACN in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid over 40 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Isolation of Aβ-(1-16) Isomers Produced from in Vitro Aging—The modified peptides resulting from incubation of Aβ-(1-16) at 70 °C for 14 days were purified by semi-preparative RP-HPLC on a C-18 Uptisphere, 5 μm, 7.8 × 250-mm column (Interchim, Montluçon, France) with a linear gradient of 27-35% MeOH in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid over 40 min at a flow-rate of 2 ml/min. Absorbance was monitored at 226 nm. Purity of the isolated species was checked by RP-HPLC and ESI-MS"

Retinoic acid-inducible gene I has been shown to contribute to virus-induced IFN production independent of the Toll-like receptor pathways in response to a variety of RNA viruses and double-stranded RNA. In the present study, we demonstrate that the NF-κB-inducible, anti-apoptotic protein A20 efficiently blocks RIG-I-mediated activation of NF-κB-, IRF-3-, and IRF-7-dependent promoters but only weakly interferes with TRIF-TLR-3-mediated IFN activation. Expression of A20 completely blocked CARD domain containing ΔRIG-I-induced IRF-3 Ser-396 phosphorylation, homodimerization, and DNA binding. The level of A20 inhibition was upstream of the TBK1/IKKϵ kinases that phosphorylate IRF3 and IRF7 and paradoxically, A20 selectively degraded the TRIF protein but not RIG-I. A20 possesses two ubiquitin-editing domains, an N-terminal deubiquitination domain and a C-terminal ubiquitin ligase domain consisting of seven zinc finger domains. Deletion of the N-terminal de-ubiquitination domain had no significant effect on the inhibitory effect of A20, whereas deletion or mutation of zinc finger motif 7 ablated the inhibitory function of A20 on IRF- or NF-κB-mediated gene expression. Furthermore, cells stably expressing the active form of RIG-I induced an antiviral state that interfered with replication of vesicular stomatitis virus, an effect that was reversed by stable co-expression of A20. These results suggest that the virus-inducible, NF-κB-dependent activation of A20 functions as a negative regulator of RIG-I-mediated induction of the antiviral state.

IRF-3 is activated by C-terminal phosphorylation, which promotes dimerization, cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation, DNA binding, association with CBP/p300 histone acetyltransferases, and transactivation of downstream early genes such as IFNB, IFNA1, and RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted).

A separate signaling pathway utilizes the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) to recognize a variety of RNA viruses and trigger the innate antiviral response, independent of the TLR-dependent pathways. RIG-I contains a DEX(D/H) box RNA helicase domain and two caspase recruitment domains (CARDs); full-length RIG-I can interact with dsRNA through its DEX(D/H) box within C terminus and augment IFN production in response to viral infection in an ATPase-dependent manner, and the two copies of the CARD at its N terminus transduce signals leading to the activation of IRF-3 and NF-κB. The constitutively active form of RIG-I (CARD domain alone) is capable of activating IRF-3 and NF-κB and stimulating IFN-β production (36Yoneyama M. Kikuchi M. Natsukawa T. Shinobu N. Imaizumi T. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Akira S. Fujita T. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (3023) Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrated that the hepatitis C virus (HCV) gene product NS3/4A protease complex efficiently blocks RIG-I signaling pathway and contributes to the establishment of HCV persistence (37Breiman A.

The generation of RIG-I-deficient mice revealed that RIG-I, but not the TLR system, plays an essential role in antiviral responses in various cells, except plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Reciprocally, the TLR system, but not RIG-I, was indispensable to IFN secretion in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (40Kato H. Sato S. Yoneyama M. Yamamoto M. Uematsu S. Matsui K. Tsujimura T. Takeda K. Fujita T. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Immunity. 2005; 23: 19-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Regulation of the TLR-independent, RIG-I signaling pathway leading to IRF-3 and NF-κB has not been well defined, although recent experiments suggest that the NF-κB-inducible ubiquitin-editing protein A20 negatively regulates IRF-3 activation (41Saitoh T. Yamamoto M. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Nakanishi M. Fujita T. Akira S. Yamamoto N. Yamaoka S. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1507-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 42Wang Y.Y. Li L. Han K.J. Zhai Z. Shu H.B. FEBS Lett. 2004; 576: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to define the involvement of A20 in the regulation of RIG-I signaling. Activation of the IFN antiviral state by RIG-I was completely inhibited by A20 expression, and the C-terminal zinc finger domain of the ubiquitin ligase region was required for the inhibitory function of A20. Furthermore, cells stably expressing the active form of RIG-I induced an antiviral state that significantly blocked replication of VSV, an effect that was reversed by stable co-expression of A20. These results demonstrate that virus-mediated activation of A20 functions as a negative regulator of RIG-I mediated induction of the antiviral state. Plasmid Constructions and Mutagenesis—Plasmids encoding IKKϵ and TBK1, P2 (2)-TK pGL3, IFNB/pGL3, IFNA14/pGL3, and pRLTK were described previously (23Sharma S. tenOever B.R. Grandvaux N. Zhou G.P.

The cDNAs encoded full-length and 1–229 amino acids of human RIG-I were amplified from FLAG-RIG-I expression plasmid (36Yoneyama M. Kikuchi M. Natsukawa T. Shinobu N. Imaizumi T. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Akira S. Fujita T. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (3023) Google Scholar). Both cDNAs were cloned into Myc pcDNA3.1/Zeo (Myc-RIG-I and Myc-ΔRIG-I). To generate Myc-ΔRIG-I IRES puro expression plasmid, the cDNA encoded Myc-ΔRIG-I was released from Myc-ΔRIG-I pcDNA3.1 zeo by NheI/BamHI and subcloned into NheI/BamHI sites of pIRES puro2 vector (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.). Full-length human A20 cDNA was amplified from FLAG-A20 expression plasmid and cloned into FLAG pcDNA3.1/Zeo (FLAG-A20). The A20 point mutants, including 1) A103, 2) zinc finger domain (ZNF) 4 MT, and 3) ZNF7 MT, were generated by overlap PCR-mediated mutagenesis. The A20 deletion mutants, including 1) 1–380, 2), 1–517, 3) 1–680, 4) 1–740, 5) 373–790, 6) ΔZNF4 (Δ537–624), 7) ΔZNF4/5 (Δ537–674), 8) ΔZNF2/3 (Δ424–536), 9) ΔZNF2–4 (Δ424–624), and 10) ΔZNF2–5 (Δ424–674), were generated by PCR. DNA sequencing was performed for confirmation of mutations. Cell Culture, Transfections, and Luciferase Assays—Transfections for Luciferase assay were carried out in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and antibiotics. Subconfluent HEK293 cells were transfected with 100 ng of pRLTK reporter (Renilla luciferase for internal control), 200 ng of pGL-3 reporter (firefly luciferase, experimental reporter), 200 ng of ΔRIG-I, TRIF, IKKϵ, or TBK1 expression plasmids, and 500 ng of pcDNA3 or FLAG A20 pcDNA3 plasmid as indicated by calcium phosphate coprecipitation method. The reporter plasmids were: IFNB pGL3, ISRE-luc, P2 (2)-TK pGL3, and IFNA14 pGL-3 reporter genes; the transfection procedures were previously described (45Lin R. Beauparlant P. Makris C. Meloche S. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1401-1409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At 24 h after transfections, the reporter gene activities were measured by Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay, according to manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Where indicated cells were treated with Sendai virus (40 hemagglutination units/ml) for the indicated time or 15 h for luciferase assays. Generation of RIG-I-, A20-, and NS3/4A-expressing Cell Lines—Plasmids pCDNA3 zeo, Myc RIG-I, and Myc-ΔRIG-I were introduced into HEK293 cells by the calcium phosphate method. Cells were selected beginning at 48 h for ∼3 weeks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated calf serum, glutamine, antibiotics, and 100 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). To generate Myc-ΔRIG-I/FLAG A20 and Myc-ΔRIG-I/FLAG NS3/4A cell lines, the Myc-ΔRIG-I IRES puro expression plasmid was co-transfected with FLAG A20 pcDNA3.1 zeo or FLAG NS3/4A pcDNA3.1 zeo plasmid into HEK293 cells by the calcium phosphate method. Cells were selected beginning at 48 h for ∼2 weeks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated calf serum, glutamine, antibiotics, and 2 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Antibody Preparation—RIG-I-(1–228) was expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein and purified by glutathione-Sepharose column chromatography. The recombinant proteins were injected into rabbits to produce antisera against RIG-I-(1–228). Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Transient transfection, co-immunoprecipitation, and Western blot analysis were performed as previous described (10Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha P.M.

Analysis of IRF-3 Dimerization by Native PAGE—Whole cell extracts were prepared in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 30 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1.0 mm Na3VO4, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml of each leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin, and 1% Nonidet P-40), and then were subjected to electrophoresis on 7.5% native acrylamide gels, which were pre-run for 30 min at 4 °C. The electrophoresis buffers were composed of an upper chamber buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.4, 192 mm glycine, and 1% sodium deoxycholate) and a lower chamber buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.4, 192 mm glycine). Gels were soaked in SDS running buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.4, 250 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS) for 30 min at 25 °C and were then electrophoretically transferred on Hybond-C nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.4, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol for 1 h at 4°C. Membranes were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at 25°Cand then were blotted with an antibody against IRF3 (1 μg/ml) in blocking solution for 1 h at 25 °C. After washing the membranes five times in phosphate-buffered saline/0.05% Tween, they were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000) in blocking solution. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Briefly, cell pellets were treated with 10 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin (10 μg/ml), pepstatin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), and 1 mm Na3VO4. Suspension was held on ice for 30 min and brought to 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 10% glycerol concentration. Samples were spun for 5 min at 5,000 rpm at 4 °C. Supernatant was removed, and the pellet was washed in 50 mm NaCl. Nuclear extracts were obtained in a 10 mm HEPES, 400 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin (10 μg/ml), pepstatin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), and 1 mm Na3VO4 solution. Samples were left to rotate at 4 °C for 30 min and spun at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Whole cell extracts were assayed for IRF-3 binding in gel shift analysis using a 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) of the IFNA/B-inducible ISG15 gene (5′-GATCGGAAAGGGAAACCGAAACTGAAGCC-3′). Complexes were formed by incubating the probe with 10 μg of nuclear extract for 20 min at room temperature in 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mg of bovine serum albumin per ml, and poly(dI-dC) (1.0 mg/ml). Extracts were run on a 5% polyacrylamide gel (60:1 crosslink) prepared in 0.25× Tris borate-EDTA. After running at 160 V for 3 h, the gel was dried and exposed to a Kodak film at –70 °C overnight. To demonstrate the specificity of the detected signal, 1 mg of anti-IRF-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology FL-425) antibody was incubated for 30 min on ice prior to the addition of the probe to observe a supershift in the complex formation. A20 Disrupts RIG-I Signaling—RIG-I signaling pathway leads to the activation of NF-κB and IRF transcription factors, which are essential for the activation of IFNB promoter (36Yoneyama M. Kikuchi M. Natsukawa T. Shinobu N. Imaizumi T. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Akira S. Fujita T. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (3023) Google Scholar), and A20 is a potent inhibitor of TLR3- and Sendai virus-induced activation of ISRE promoter (42Wang Y.Y. Li L. Han K.J. Zhai Z. Shu H.B. FEBS Lett. 2004; 576: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To determine the ability of A20 to inhibit RIG-I-mediated activation of IFNB gene transcription, a constitutively active form of RIG-I-(ΔRIG-I) and A20-expressing plasmids were co-transfected into HEK293 cells together with an IFNB promoter construct and examined for their ability to activate IFNB reporter gene activity. The IFNB promoter had a low basal activity that was not affected by A20 expression (Fig. 1A). The expression of ΔRIG-I alone resulted in a 275-fold stimulation of IFNB promoter activity, and co-expression of A20 totally inhibited ΔRIG-I-mediated activation of IFNB promoter activity (Fig. 1A). An ISRE reporter construct together with ΔRIG-I- and A20-expressing plasmids further demonstrated that RIG-I mediated activation of IRF-3 was blocked by A20. As shown in Fig. 1B, the expression of constitutively active form of RIG-I stimulated the ISRE luciferase reporter gene activity up to 1700-fold, whereas co-expression of A20 with ΔRIG-I almost completely blocked ISRE luciferase reporter gene activity (Fig. 1B). A20 also blocked RIG-I-mediated activation of IRF-7 and the IFNA4 luciferase reporter gene. Expression of ΔRIG-I activated IRF-7 and further enhanced IRF-7-mediated IFNA4 promoter activity 24-fold, whereas co-expression of A20 completely blocked IFNA4 (Fig. 1C). Similarly, A20 blocked RIG-I mediated NF-κB activation (Fig. 1D); the P2 (2)-TK luciferase reporter (two copies of NF-κB binding site from human IFNB promoter linked to minimal TK promoter) was induced 15-fold by ΔRIG-I, an induction that was completely blocked by A20 co-expression. These experiments indicate that A20 is a strong inhibitor of RIG-I signaling to IRF-3 and NF-κB. A20 Blocks RIG-I-mediated Transactivation but Only Partially Inhibits TRIF- or IKKϵ/TBK1-mediated Transactivation—A20 targets the TLR-3 adapter TRIF and inhibits TLR-3- and Sendai virus-induced activation of ISRE and IFNB promoter (42Wang Y.Y. Li L. Han K.J. Zhai Z. Shu H.B. FEBS Lett. 2004; 576: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In addition, Saitoh and colleagues (41Saitoh T. Yamamoto M. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Nakanishi M. Fujita T. Akira S. Yamamoto N. Yamaoka S. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1507-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) showed that A20 physically interacted with IKKϵ/TBK1 and inhibited TLR-3- and Newcastle disease virus-mediated activation of IRF-3. To further investigate the level at which A20 inhibited ISRE activation, a dose-response curve was performed with increasing amounts of A20 and RIG-I, TRIF, IKKϵ, or TBK1 expression plasmids (Fig. 2). ΔRIG-I (200 ng) resulted in 1500-fold induction of the ISRE promoter, whereas A20 expression plasmid (40 ng) inhibited ΔRIG-I-mediated activation more than 15-fold; increasing the A20 concentration essentially reduced the ΔRIG-I activation to background levels (Fig. 2A). In contrast, when TRIF, IKKϵ, or TBK1 signaling components were used to activate ISRE promoter activity (2800-, 750-, and 850-fold, respectively), the inhibitory effect of A20 was significantly weaker, with only 2- to 3-fold inhibition observed at the highest concentrations of transfected A20 used (Fig. 2, B–D). This result argues that RIG-I signaling is the primary target for A20 inhibition, that TRIF-TLR-3 signaling is not significantly affected, and that the inhibitory effect occurs upstream of the IKKϵ or TBK1 kinases. Silencing of A20 Expression Enhances Virus-mediated Activation of ISRE Promoter—Next, to determine whether interference with endogenous A20 expression would modulate ISRE promoter activity, HEK293 cells were transfected with an small interference RNA expression construct directed against A20 (44Storz P. Doppler H. Ferran C. Grey S.T. Toker A. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and subsequently infected with Sendai virus. Expression of A20 was induced by virus and effectively blocked by A20 specific small interference RNA but not a scrambled small interference RNA (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 3). Inhibition of A20 expression correlated with enhanced ISRE-dependent transcription induced by Sendai virus infection (Fig. 3B), thus demonstrating that endogenous A20 is involved in the regulation of ISRE-dependent promoter activity. A20 Inhibits RIG-I-mediated IRF-3 Activation—Latent IRF-3 is activated in response to virus infection by phosphorylation events that target a cluster of Ser/Thr residues at the C-terminal end of the protein (23Sharma S. tenOever B.R. Grandvaux N. Zhou G.P. Lin R. Hiscott J. Science. 2003; 300: 1148-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). Ser-396 within the C-terminal Ser/Thr cluster is targeted in vivo for phosphorylation following virus infection and plays an essential role in IRF-3 activation (23Sharma S. tenOever B.R. Grandvaux N. Zhou G.P. Lin R. Hiscott J. Science. 2003; 300: 1148-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar, 35Fitzgerald K.A. McWhirter S.M. Faia K.L. Rowe D.C. Latz E. Golenbock D.T. Coyle A.J. Liao S.M. Maniatis T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2003) Google Scholar). Therefore, the phosphorylation state of IRF-3 following ΔRIG-I expression was evaluated by immunoblot using the phosphospecific Ser-396 antibody. ΔRIG-I induced the accumulation of the Ser-396 phosphorylation (Fig. 4A, lane 3), and ΔRIG-I-induced Ser-396 phosphorylation was completely block by A20 (Fig. 4A, lane 4). Expression of TRIF or TBK1 similarly induced Ser-396 phosphorylation (Fig. 4A, lanes 5 and 7); however, A20 only partially reduced TRIF- or TBK1-induced Ser-396 phosphorylation (Fig. 4A, lanes 6 and 8). Complementing the phosphorylation status, the ability of A20 to inhibit ΔRIG-I-induced IRF-3 dimerization was evaluated using native SDS-PAGE and immunoblot with anti-IRF-3 antibody.

https://openalex.org/W2012921623,"Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), a serine protease well known for generating plasmin, has been demonstrated to induce matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) gene expression and protein secretion in renal interstitial fibroblasts. However, exactly how tPA transduces its signal into the nucleus to control gene expression is unknown. This study investigated the mechanism by which tPA induces MMP-9 gene expression. Both wild-type and non-enzymatic mutant tPA were found to induce MMP-9 expression in rat kidney interstitial fibroblasts (NRK-49F), indicating that the actions of tPA are independent of its proteolytic activity. tPA bound to the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1) in NRK-49F cells, and this binding was competitively abrogated by the LRP-1 antagonist, the receptor-associated protein. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (PEA-13) lacking LRP-1, tPA failed to induce MMP-9 expression. Furthermore, tPA induced rapid tyrosine phosphorylation on the β subunit of LRP-1, which was followed by the activation of Mek1 and its downstream Erk-1 and -2. Blockade of Erk-1/2 activation by the Mek1 inhibitor abolished MMP-9 induction by tPA in NRK-49F cells. Conversely, overexpression of constitutively activated Mek1 induced Erk-1/2 phosphorylation and MMP-9 expression. In mouse obstructed kidney, tPA, LRP-1, and MMP-9 were concomitantly induced in the renal interstitium. Collectively, these results suggest that besides its classical proteolytic activity, tPA acts as a cytokine that binds to the cell membrane receptor LRP-1, induces its tyrosine phosphorylation, and triggers intracellular signal transduction, thereby inducing specific gene expression in renal interstitial fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2037320436,"In yeast, phosphatidylethanolamine is a target of the Atg8 modifier in ubiquitylation-like reactions essential for autophagy. Three human Atg8 (hAtg8) homologs, LC3, GABARAP, and GATE-16, have been characterized as modifiers in reactions mediated by hAtg7 (an E1-like enzyme) and hAtg3 (an E2-like enzyme) as in yeast Atg8 lipidation, but their final targets have not been identified. The results of a recent study in which COS7 cells were incubated with [14C]ethanolamine for 48 h suggested that phosphatidylethanolamine is a target of LC3. However, these results were not conclusive because of the long incubation time. To identify the phospholipid targets of Atg8 homologs, we reconstituted conjugation systems for mammalian Atg8 homologs in vitro using purified recombinant Atg proteins and liposomes. Each purified mutant Atg8 homolog with an exposed C-terminal Gly formed an E1-substrate intermediate with hAtg7 via a thioester bond in an ATP-dependent manner and formed an E2-substrate intermediate with hAtg3 via a thioester bond dependent on ATP and hAtg7. A conjugated form of each Atg8 homolog was observed in the presence of hAtg7, hAtg3, ATP, and liposomes. In addition to phosphatidylethanolamine, in vitro conjugation experiments using synthetic phospholipid liposomes showed that phosphatidylserine is also a target of LC3, GABARAP, and GATE-16. In contrast, thin layer chromatography of phospholipids released on hAtg4B-digestion from endogenous LC3-phospholipid conjugate revealed that phosphatidylethanolamine, but not phosphatidylserine, is the predominant target phospholipid of LC3 in vivo.

Ubiquitin and E1 form an E1-substrate intermediate via a thioester bond between the E1 active site Cys and the C-terminal Gly of ubiquitin. Thereafter, the activated ubiquitin is transferred to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), which forms an E2-substrate intermediate with ubiquitin via a thioester bond between the E2 active site Cys and the C-terminal Gly of ubiquitin. Finally, the ubiquitin is conjugated to a target protein via an amide bond between the C-terminal Gly of ubiquitin and a Lys within the target protein by a ubiquitin ligase (E3). These enzyme-reaction systems (E1, E2, and E3) are essentially conserved among the other ubiquitylation-like modifications of ubiquitin-like proteins (10Jentsch S. Pyrowolakis G. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 335-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Yeast Atg8 is a unique ubiquitin-like protein essential for autophagy; whereas the targets of ubiquitin and the other ubiquitin-like proteins are proteins, the target of Atg8 is a phospholipid, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Genetic analyses have indicated that Atg8 is cleaved by Atg4, a predicted cysteine protease, to expose its C-terminal Gly. Thereafter, Atg8 is activated by Atg7, an E1-like enzyme, and transferred to Atg3p, an E2-like enzyme. Finally, Atg8 is covalently conjugated to PE through an amide bond between the C-terminal Gly of Atg8 and an amino group in the hydrophilic head within PE (11Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T.

Recently, the Atg8 lipidation system has been reconstituted in vitro. These experiments indicated that a mutant Atg8, in which the C-terminal Gly is exposed, as well as Atg7, Atg3, and PE-containing liposomes, are the minimum reaction units in yeast (13Ichimura Y.

In mammals, at least three Atg8 homologs, LC3, GABARAP, and GATE-16, have been identified (Fig. 1A), all of which have structural ubiquitin folds (14Sugawara K. Suzuki N.N. Fujioka Y. Mizushima N.

In vivo and in vitro biochemical analyses have shown that human Atg4B is an authentic cysteine protease essential for cleavage of the C terminus of each Atg8 homolog to expose the C-terminal Gly (17Kabeya Y.

After cleavage, each Atg8 homolog is activated by human Atg7 (hAtg7), transferred to human Atg3 (hAtg3), and finally forms a conjugate as a modifier (19Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A.

Commun. 2003; 300: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that LC3 and GABARAP form protein-phospholipid conjugates, LC3-II and GABARAP-PL, respectively (18Tanida I. Sou Y.S. Ezaki J. Minematsu-Ikeguchi N. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36268-36276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Incubation of COS7 cells with [14C]ethanolamine for 48 h has been reported to result in incorporation of radioactivity into the LC3-phospholipid conjugate (LC3-II), suggesting that the target of LC3, similar to yeast Atg8, is PE (17Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Oshitani-Okamoto S. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2805-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). The metabolic pathways of the synthesis and degradation of phospholipids, however, are such that 48-h labeling with [14C]ethanolamine cannot lead to conclusive results. Although the target of the third homolog, GATE-16, is not yet known, a conjugated form of GATE-16 (GATE-16-II) shows biochemical characteristics similar to those of LC3-II and GABARAP-PL, suggesting that the target of GATE-16 may also be a phospholipid. However, there are differences among the conjugated forms of the three Atg8 homologs. For example, the amount of LC3-II in rat tissues cannot be correlated with the amounts of the other conjugates. In HEK293 cells, conjugation of LC3, but not of GATE-16 or GABARAP, is facilitated by overexpression of hAtg7 and hAtg3. In HeLa cells, LC3-II and GABARAP-PL, but not GATE-16-II, accumulate in the presence of the protease inhibitors, E64d and pepstatin A, under nutrient-rich conditions. In the livers of mice lacking Atg7, the amounts of the unlipidated forms of all three Atg8 homologs increase, suggesting that conjugation of all three molecules is active in the mouse liver (21Komatsu M. Waguri S. Ueno T. Iwata J. Murata S. Tanida I. Ezaki J. Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Uchiyama Y. Kominami E. Tanaka K. Chiba T. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1899) Google Scholar). In the present study, we focused on whether hAtg7, hAtg3, and phospholipid(s) are the minimum essential requirements needed for conjugation of the three mammalian Atg8 homologs and on the nature of the targets of these three human Atg8 homologs. We hypothesized that PE and phosphatidylserine (PS) may be targets, because the hydrophilic heads of both PE and PS have amino groups, which are required in ubiquitylation-like reactions. We reconstituted the conjugation systems for the mammalian Atg8 homologs in vitro using purified recombinant hAtg7, hAtg3, LC3, GABARAP, and GATE-16, as well as synthetic phospholipid liposomes. Furthermore, we directly analyzed the in vivo target phospholipid of endogenous LC3-II purified from HeLa cells by TLC.

The Escherichia coli strain JM109 was used for plasmid construction and protein expression. Total lipid was extracted from HeLa cells as described (22Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem.

To generate polyclonal serum against GATE-16, a rabbit was immunized with purified GST-GATE-16, and antibody in the serum was affinity-purified by a thioredoxin-GATE-16-immobilized Sepharose column. To remove cross-reactive antibodies against LC3 and GABARAP, the affinity-purified antibody was passed through thioredoxin-GABARAP- and thioredoxin-LC3-immobilized Sepharose columns. Anti-GABARAP antibody recognizes lipidated GABARAP better than unlipidated GABARAP, and anti-GATE-16 antibody recognizes lipidated GATE-16 better than unlipidated GATE-16.

To stop the reaction, an equal volume of SDS solution containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol was added, and the mixture was boiled for 5 min. Identification of Phospholipid Conjugated to LC3-I—Endogenous LC3-II (LC3-phospholipid conjugate) in HeLa cells was accumulated in the presence of the protease inhibitors, E64d and pepstatin A, as described (18Tanida I.

After preparation of an LC3-II-enriched membrane fraction from the inhibitor-treated HeLa cells (about 1 × 108 cells/analysis), LC3-II was solubilized from LC3-II-rich total membrane fraction in TX solution (2% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) (18Tanida I.

Released phospholipids were extracted from reaction mixtures using Bligh-Dyer's method (22Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42389) Google Scholar) and subsequently separated by TLC on Kieselgel 60 plates (Merck) using chloroform/methanol/deionized water (65:25:4, v/v/v) as a solvent. The TLC plates were dried in a fume hood (5 min) and sprayed with primuline reagent (29Wright R.S. J. Chromatogr. 1971; 59: 220-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) to detect phospholipids under UV light (main wavelength, 365 nm). In Vitro E1-Substrate Formation between hAtg7 and Each Mutant Atg8 Homolog, LC3TFG, GABARAPVYG, and GATE-16TFG—In HEK293, COS7, and HeLa cells, almost all of the C termini of LC3, GABARAP, and GATE-16 are posttranslationally cleaved to expose a C-terminal Gly residue, which is essential for ubiquitylation-like reactions. Therefore, for in vitro E1-substrate reactions, hAtg7 and a series of mutant Atg8 homologs were expressed as GST fusion proteins in E. coli and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B and PreScission protease (Fig. 1). Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of the resultant proteins on SDS-PAGE showed that all three had been purified almost to homogeneity (Fig. 1C). We first focused on the formation of the E1-substrate intermediate between hAtg7 and LC3TFG by mixing hAtg7 (0.1 μm) and LC3TFG (0.1 μm) and incubating them at 25 °C for 1 h in the presence or absence of ATP (5 mm). After stopping the reaction, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (4–12% linear gradient) under nonreducing conditions, and LC3TFG was recognized by immunoblotting using anti-LC3 antibody. In the presence of ATP, a band of about 100 kDa, corresponding to the hAtg7-LC3TFG (E1-substrate) intermediate was recognized (Fig. 2A). Little intermediate was recognized in the presence of a reducing reagent, DTT (100 mm), indicating that the intermediate was formed via a thioester bond. Little intermediate was observed when we used a mutant LC3TF in which the C-terminal Gly had been deleted instead of LC3TFG. Similar results were obtained in the assays for E1-substrate intermediates of GABARAPVYG and GATE-16TFG (Fig. 2, B and C). Bands of about 100 kDa, corresponding to hAtg7-GABARAPVYG and hAtg7-GATE-16TFG (E1-substrate) intermediates were recognized by their respective antibodies only in the presence of ATP, in a manner sensitive to the reducing reagent, DTT (100 mm). There was little intermediate formation when GABARAPVY and GATE-16TF were substituted for GABARAPVYG and GATE-16TFG, respectively. These results indicated that hAtg7, each of the Atg8 homologs, and ATP are the minimum materials essential for the formation of E1-substrate intermediates via thioester bonds. In Vitro E2-substrate Formation between hAtg3 and Each Mutant Atg8 Homolog—We next investigated whether each of the Atg8 homologs could form an E2-substrate intermediate with hAtg3 in vitro. Similar to the other proteins above, hAtg3 was expressed as a GST fusion protein in E. coli and purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B and PreScission protease (Fig. 1C). To form an E2-substrate intermediate between hAtg3 and LC3TFG, we incubated hAtg7 (0.1 μm), hAtg3 (0.1 μm), and LC3TFG (0.1 μm) at 25°C for 1 h in the presence or absence of ATP (5 mm). After stopping the reaction, the proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (4–12% linear gradient or 12%) under nonreducing conditions, and LC3TFG was recognized by immunoblotting with anti-LC3 antibody (Fig. 3A). In the presence of ATP, a band of about 60 kDa, corresponding to an hAtg3-LC3TFG (E2-substrate) intermediate, was observed. This band was not observed in the absence of hAtg7 or ATP and was sensitive to the reducing reagent, DTT (100 mm). When LC3TF was employed instead of LC3TFG, little E2-substrate intermediate was detected, indicating that the C-terminal Gly of LC3 is essential for this reaction in vitro. Similar results were obtained in the assays for E2-substrate intermediates of GABARAPVYG and GATE-16TFG (Fig. 3, B and C). When hAtg7 (0.1 μm), hAtg3 (0.1 μm), ATP (5 mm), and GABARAPVYG or GATE-16TFG (0.1 μm) were mixed, an E2-substrate intermediate between hAtg3 and GABARAPVYG or GATE-16TFG was detected by immunoblotting with the respective antibodies. These intermediates were sensitive to 100 mm DTT and were dependent on the presence of hAtg7 and ATP. When GABARAPVY and GATE-16TF were substituted for GABARAPVYG and GATE-16TFG, respectively, little intermediate was observed, indicating that the C-terminal Gly of GABARAP and GATE-16 is required for this reaction in vitro. In Vitro Conjugation Reactions of the Three Atg8 Homologs, Mediated by hAtg7 and hAtg3—Yeast Atg8 is conjugated to PE in vitro and in vivo. It is unclear whether hAtg7 and hAtg3 are the minimum enzymes required for the conjugation reactions and whether GATE-16 is conjugated to a phospholipid(s). To clarify these problems, we investigated whether the conjugated forms of the three Atg8 homologs are generated by hAtg7 and hAtg3 after E1 and E2 reactions in vitro. As a phospholipid source, we used liposomes generated from total lipids isolated from HeLa cells, because LC3-II (an LC3-phospholipid conjugate) and GABARAP-PL (a GABARAP-phospholipid conjugate) are present in HeLa cells under nutrient-rich conditions. We found that LC3-II was generated when hAtg7 (0.1 μm), hAtg3 (0.1 μm), liposomes (30 μm), and LC3TFG (0.1 μm) were incubated in the presence of ATP (5 mm) at 25 °C for 1 h, as determined by immunoblotting with anti-LC3 antibody (Fig. 4A). In the absence of hAtg7, hAtg3, ATP, or liposomes, or when LC3TF was substituted for LC3TFG, little conjugate was observed. Similar results were obtained for GABARAP and GATE-16 conjugation reactions (Fig. 4, B and C); i.e. GABARAP-PL was detected by immunoblotting with anti-GABARAP antibody only when all components (hAtg7, hAtg3, ATP, GABARAPVYG, and liposomes) were present in the reaction mixture, whereas little GABARAP-PL was formed when GABARAPVY was substituted for GABARAPVYG (Fig. 4B). GATE-16-II, a conjugated form of GATE-16, was detected by immunoblotting with anti-GATE-16 antibody only when all components (hAtg7, hAtg3, ATP, GATE-16TFG, and liposomes) were present in the reaction mixture, but little GATE-16-II was formed when GATE-16TF was substituted for GATE-16TFG (Fig. 4C). These results indicated that the minimum essential requirements for in vitro conjugation of the hAtg8 homologs include hAtg7, hAtg3, ATP, liposomes, and each hAtg8 homolog. LC3, GABARAP, and GATE-16 Are Conjugated to both PE and PS in Vitro—Conjugates of LC3 and GABARAP have been reported to be sensitive to phospholipase D, suggesting that these hAtg8 homologs target a phospholipid(s). Ubiquitin and other modifiers are conjugated to targets via amide bonds between the carboxyl group in their C-terminal Gly residue and the side chain amino group in a Lys residue or in the hydrophilic head of PE. Since PE and PS have amino groups in their hydrophilic heads, these phospholipids are potential targets of the human Atg8 homologs. To determine whether phospholipids are conjugated to the Atg8 homologs, we prepared liposomes composed of pure synthetic phospholipids (POPC, a molecular species of PC; DOPE, a molecular species of PE; and DOPS, a molecular species of PS), and reconstituted the conjugation reactions in vitro (Fig. 5). We first focused on the effects of synthetic phospholipid-based liposomes on the conjugation of LC3. When liposomes consisting of 100% DOPS were used in the in vitro reconstitution of LC3 conjugation, LC3-II was observed by immunoblotting with anti-LC3 antibody (Fig. 5A, lane 2). In contrast, when liposomes containing 100% DOPE and 100% POPC were employed, no LC3-II was observed (Fig. 5A, lanes 1 and 3). We further investigated the optimum concentration of PS (DOPS) in the liposomes for in vitro conjugation by varying the concentration of DOPS in the liposomes from 0 to 100%. LC3-II was observed when 10–100% DOPS liposomes were used (Fig. 5A, lanes 8–15), with the optimum DOPS concentration for in vitro LC3 conjugation being 55–85%. These results indicated that PS is a target of LC3. Since 100% DOPE is not structurally suitable for formation of liposomes, we prepared a series of DOPE-containing liposomes and investigated their effects on LC3 conjugation (Fig. 5A, lanes 4–7). Using a series of DOPE-containing liposomes (33% DOPE, 33% DOPS, 33% POPC; 50% POPC, 50% DOPE; and 50% DOPE, 50% DOPS), we observed LC3-II formation in 100% DOPS liposomes (Fig. 5A, lanes 4, 6, and 7). Using liposomes containing 0–100% DOPE, we observed LC3-II formation in the presence of liposomes containing 10–70% DOPE (Fig. 5A, lanes 8–15), with the optimum DOPE concentration for in vitro LC3 conjugation being 25–55%. These results indicated that PE is also a target of LC3 conjugation in vitro. We next focused on the effects of synthetic phospholipid-based liposomes on in vitro GABARAP conjugation. Since there are differences in the amounts of the modified forms of LC3, GABARAP, and GATE-16 in rat tissues, there may be divergence among these hAtg8 homologs regarding their target phospholipids or their optimum concentrations. However, we observed little difference between LC3 and GABARAP conjugation reactions in vitro (Fig. 5B). GABARAP-PL was observed using 100% DOPS liposomes (Fig. 5B, lane 2) but not using liposomes composed of 100% DOPE or 100% POPC. Use of a series of DOPE- and DOPS-containing liposomes in the reaction mixture (Fig. 5B) indicated that their optimum concentrations for in vitro GABARAP conjugation were similar to those observed for LC3 conjugation (Fig. 5B, lanes 8–23). These results indicated that both PS and PE are targets of GABARAP conjugation in vitro. Previous biochemical studies of GATE-16-II and the results shown in Fig. 4C suggested that PS and PE are potential targets of GATE-16 conjugation. Therefore, we used synthetic phospholipid liposomes to investigate GATE-16 conjugation. When 100% DOPS and a series of DOPE liposomes were employed in the in vitro reaction, GATE-16-II was observed by immunoblotting with anti-GATE-16 antibody (Fig. 5C). The optimum concentrations of DOPS and DOPE liposomes for in vitro GATE-16 conjugation were similar to those observed for LC3 and GABARAP (Fig. 5C, lanes 8–23). These findings indicated that GATE-16-II is a protein-phospholipid conjugate and that the targets of GATE-16 are also PS and PE. In conclusion, both PS and PE are targets of all three Atg8 homologs (LC3, GABARAP, and GATE-16) in these protein-phospholipid conjugation reactions. The in Vivo Target of Endogenous LC3 Is Phosphatidylethanolamine but Not Phosphatidylserine—In the in vitro conjugation reaction, LC3 could conjugate with both PS and PE. However, it is not known whether this is also the case in vivo. The results of a recent study involving the incubation of [14C]ethanolamine in COS7 cells for 48 h suggested that phosphatidylethanolamine is a target of LC3 (17Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Oshitani-Okamoto S. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2805-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). However, the experiment could not exclude the possibility that phosphatidylserine may be another endogenous target of LC3 in the ATG conjugation reaction, as in the case of in vitro conjugation. To identify the endogenous target phospholipid(s) of LC3 in vivo, we first purified endogenous LC3-II from HeLa cells in the presence of lysosomal protease inhibitors, E64d (10 μg/ml) and pepstatin A (10 μg/ml), as described (18Tanida I. Sou Y.S. Ezaki J. Minematsu-Ikeguchi N. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36268-36276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), delipidated LC3-II with the delipidating enzyme, hAtg4B, and analyzed the phospholipids released on reaction with purified endogenous LC3-II. Endogenous LC3-II was solubilized from the total membrane fraction with TX solution and affinity-purified on an anti-LC3 antibody-immobilized Sepharose column. Purified LC3-II was incubated with either wild-type hAtg4B or inactive mutant hAtg4BC74A. Silver staining and immunoblotting analysis clearly showed that wild-type hAtg4B completely delipidated LC3-II to form LC3-I (Fig. 6, B and C). In contrast, incubation of the mutant hAtg4BC74A with LC3-II did not cause delipidation (Fig. 6, B and C). The phospholipids were extracted from the reaction products using the Bligh-Dyer method (22Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42389) Google Scholar) and further analyzed by TLC. As clearly shown in Fig. 6D, treatment of LC3-II with wild-type hAtg4B released PE but not PS. No phospholipid spots were detected with the sample treated with the inactive mutant, hAtg4BC74A. These results indicated that PE, but not PS, is the target phospholipid conjugated with endogenous LC3 in vivo. The results of the present study indicated that in vitro conjugation systems for the three Atg8 homologs, LC3, GABARAP, and GATE-16, can be reconstituted using purified hAtg7 (E1-like enzyme), hAtg3 (E2-like enzyme), and synthetic phospholipid liposomes. All three hAtg7-Atg8 homolog intermediates (E1-substrate intermediates) formed via ATP-dependent thioester bonds, and all three hAtg3-Atg8 homolog intermediates (E2-substrate intermediates) formed via thioester bonds dependent on ATP and hAtg7. Finally, all three Atg8 homologs were conjugated to phospholipids, PS and PE. The findings presented here lead to three conclusions. First, the minimum components necessary for human Atg8-phospholipid conjugations were shown to be hAtg7, hAtg3, the respective Atg8 homolog (LC3, GABARAP, or GATE-16), phospholipid (DOPE or DOPS)-containing liposomes, and ATP. Second, the modified form of GATE-16, GATE-16-II, is a protein-phospholipid conjugate and therefore should be designated GATE-16-PL instead of GATE-16-II. Finally, PS and PE are targets of all human Atg8 modifiers in vitro. We have further demonstrated that the in vivo target phospholipid of endogenous LC3-II is predominantly PE, as revealed by TLC analysis. This is the first direct evidence for the identity of the target phospholipid of the LC3 conjugation system in vivo. These observations raise questions regarding the apparent discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo data. Our in vitro conjugation system requires only E1-like enzyme (Atg7) and E2-like enzyme (Atg3) for conjugation of the three Atg8 homologs with PE or PS as in yeast in vitro conjugation of Atg8 with PE (13Ichimura Y. Imamura Y. Emoto K. Umeda M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40584-40592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). However, this does not exclude the possible involvement of some other as yet unidentified factors (Fig. 7) in promoting selective conjugation of LC3-I with PE in vivo. Both positive regulatory factor (X) and negative regulatory factor (Y) should be considered. One potential candidate for X is an E3-like enzyme, which specifically recognizes PE as the substrate of conjugation reaction of activated LC3-I on Atg3 (E2-like enzyme), making efficient and preferential transfer of LC3-I to PE possible. We hypothesize a presumptive negative regulatory factor (Y), which inhibits LC3 conjugation to PS (Fig. 7). In our in vitro reconstitution experiments, all three Atg8 homologs (LC3, GABARAP, and GATE-16) could be conjugated with both PE and PS. However, cellular expression levels of the three homologs are quite different in native tissues and cultured cells (30Tanida I. Ueno T. Kominami E. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 2503-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). Therefore, the levels of the lipidated forms of the homologs must also be diverse. Hence, the preferential homologs to be lipidated may be different, depending on tissues and cells, and target phospholipid(s) may be also different depending on which of the three homologs is involved in the reaction. Thus, participation of negative regulatory factor (Y) is also a likely mechanism of in vivo lipidation of Atg8 homologs. Experiments are currently under way in our laboratory to screen for possible candidates of X and Y, since it is important to identify and characterize such regulatory factor(s) to improve our understanding of the mechanism of mammalian autophagy.

Hypoxia (0.1% O2 for 10 h) and cAMP-mediated inhibition of CcO activity were accompanied by hyperphosphorylation of subunits I, IVi1, and Vb and markedly increased reactive O2 species production by the enzyme complex in an in vitro system that uses reduced cytochrome c as an electron donor.

Some studies also suggest that the myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury is manifested through altered CcO activity and reduced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (13Lesnefsky E.J. Tandler B. Ye J. Slabe T.J. Turkaly J. Hoppel C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1544-H1554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lesnefsky E.J. Hoppel C.L. Arch. Biochem.

Noble M.A. Mentzer Jr., R.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 3345-3356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), although the roles of different cellular components in mediating this injury remain unclear. The presence of PKA and PKC activities in the mitochondrial inner membrane-matrix compartment and the role of PKC-mediated phosphorylation in the regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase activity are well established (16Sardanelli A.M. Technikova-Dobrova Z. Speranza F. Mazzocca A. Scacco S. Papa S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 276-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). An 18-kDa subunit of the NADH dehydrogenase (complex I) (17Scacco S. Vergari R. Scarpulla R.C. Technikova-Dobrova Z. Sardanelli A. Lambo R. Lorusso V. Papa S. J. Biol.

Kadenbach B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 130-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vitro phosphorylation of bovine heart and rat heart CcO results in 40–70% reduced activity (18Bender E. Kadenbach B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 130-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 19Vijayasarathy C. Damle S. Lenka N. Avadhani N.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, phosphorylation of CcO subunits in vivo in whole cells or tissues and its effect on enzyme activity have not yet been investigated. In addition to possible regulation by protein phosphorylation, CcO activity in mammalian tissues is also modulated by lipid composition and reactive oxygen species (ROS). For example, a decline in CcO activity during ischemia and reperfusion (8Burke P.V. Poyton R.O. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 1163-1175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Turcotte M.L. Parliament M.

Acta. 1998; 1371: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) has been attributed, at least in part, to a decreased cardiolipin content or its modification by peroxy radicals. Indeed cardiolipin content plays an important role in CcO activity and reconstitution of the detergent-solubilized enzyme complex (17Scacco S. Vergari R. Scarpulla R.C. Technikova-Dobrova Z. Sardanelli A. Lambo R. Lorusso V. Papa S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17578-17582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Additionally, studies by Darley-Usmar and co-workers (20Shiva S. Oh J.Y. Landar A.L. Ulasova E. Venkatraman A. Bailey S.M. Darley-Usmar V.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 38: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) have shown that mitochondrially generated NO during various pathophysiological conditions modulates CcO activity by direct binding to the heme and altering the activity of the enzyme complex. In the present study we have used murine macrophage cells in culture and in vitro perfused rabbit heart system to investigate the effects of hypoxia and ischemia, respectively, on the phosphorylation status and activity of CcO enzyme. Our results show that both experimental hypoxia and ischemia cause increased mitochondrial PKA activity and increased phosphorylation of CcO subunits. These conditions resulted in significantly lower CcO activity and vastly increased ROS production by the CcO complex. More important, specific inhibitors of PKA but not PKC rendered marked protection against ischemia/reperfusion injury in the perfused rabbit heart system. Cell Culture and Hypoxic Conditions—RAW 264.7 mouse monocyte macrophages were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum as described before (6Vijayasarathy C. Damle S. Prabu S.K. Otto C.M. Avadhani N.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 871-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cells at 80–90% confluency were grown under hypoxic conditions (0.1% O2) for 10 h or normoxic conditions (21% O2) for 10 h as described before (6Vijayasarathy C. Damle S. Prabu S.K. Otto C.M. Avadhani N.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 871-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Ischemia and Perfusion Protocol—All animal procedures were carried out in conformance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals from the National Institutes of Health. Hearts from New Zealand male white rabbits (2–2.5 kg) were perfused using a Langendorff perfusion apparatus as described before (21Spear J.F. Moore E.N. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2002; 39: 761-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The aorta was cannulated and the heart suspended on a Langendorff perfusion apparatus in which the coronary arteries were perfused from a reservoir with oxygenated temperature-controlled Tyrode's solution at a constant pressure of 80 mm Hg. The heart was surrounded by a temperature-controlled 50-ml chamber with an overflow so that the heart was submerged in its effluence. Coronary flow was measured by a timed drip-count from the overflow. Two orthogonal bipolar electrocardiograms (X and Y leads) were recorded by two pairs of 1 cm in diameter gold-plated electrodes that were affixed to the walls of the chamber. In order to monitor contractility, a water-filled latex balloon connected to a pressure gauge was inserted into the left ventricular cavity. The preload was adjusted to ∼5–10 mm Hg. The pulse pressure was measured to the nearest 0.5 mm Hg. All other instrumental settings and measurements were done as described previously (21Spear J.F. Moore E.N. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2002; 39: 761-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We were able to induce global ischemia without complete disruption of coronary circulation by reducing aortic perfusion to 2.5 ml/min. This level of perfusion is below the critical level for producing ischemic changes but still provides a coronary flow in order to ensure continued delivery of agents. Focal ischemia was produced by ligating the anterior division of the left coronary artery near its origin by using a snare made with 2-0-gauge silk suture passed under the artery and sheathed in a 20-gauge polyethylene tube. For experimental groups involving inhibitors, either PKA-specific inhibitor H89 or MPI (50 nm each) or PKC-specific inhibitor Go6850 (10 nm) was added to the perfusion medium before the onset of the experiment. Evaluation of the Ischemic Damage—Ischemia/reperfusion damage caused by anterior coronary artery occlusion was evaluated by delineating the nonperfused volume of myocardium at risk during the occlusion and the volume of myocardial necrosis after 2 h of reperfusion. After reperfusion (2 h) the snare was reapplied, and the heart was perfused with india ink to delineate the nonperfused volume at risk. The heart was removed from the apparatus, sectioned transversely from apex to base in 3-mm thick sections, and incubated for 20 min at 36 °C in 1% triphenyltetrazolium chloride solution to delineate the necrotic zone. The area of the necrotic region and the area at risk were measured from enlarged photographs of the sections using computer-based planimetry. The volumes of the necrotic regions and the risk regions were calculated using the thickness of the slices. Isolation of Mitochondria and Assay of CcO Activity—Mitochondria were isolated from cells and myocardial tissue by differential centrifugation of cell and tissue homogenates in mitochondria isolation buffer (MIB: 70 mm sucrose, 220 mm mannitol, 2.5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 2 mm EDTA) as described before (22Bhat N.K. Niranjan B.G. Avadhani N.G. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were washed three times with MIB and in some experiments were treated with digitonin (75 μg/mg protein) as described before (22Bhat N.K. Niranjan B.G. Avadhani N.G. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Submitochondrial particles (SMP) were prepared as described (6Vijayasarathy C. Damle S. Prabu S.K. Otto C.M. Avadhani N.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 871-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, mitochondria were sonicated for 120 s with a 10-s on/off cycle using ultrasonic processor model GE130PB and probe CU188-3548 and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was centrifuged again at 150,000 × g for 45 min using Sorvall RC M120EX ultracentrifuge. The pellet was suspended and used as SMP. CcO activity was assayed by two different approaches. In the first approach, CcO activity was measured in permeabilized cells as described before (23Chrzanowska-Lightowers Z.M.A. Turnbull D.M. Nightowlers R.N. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) under conditions that inflict minimal membrane perturbation. Briefly, cells were permeabilized by the addition of 0.01% digitonin for 15 min with agitation. The assay medium consisted of 4 μm 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrachloride (DAB), 100 μm reduced cytochrome c, 2 μg/ml catalase in 0.01 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. An increase in oxidized DAB, which is directly proportional to the CcO activity, was measured at 450 nm. In the second approach, CcO was solubilized from SMP with 1.5% sodium cholate and reconstituted into asolectin-cardiolipin vesicles as described (24Arnold S. Kadenbach B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 25Buge U. Kadenbach B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 161: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Orientation of CcO in the vesicles was determined by spectral analysis following sequential reduction with ascorbate and dithionate (26Casey R.P. Ariano B.H. Azzi A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 122: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The CcO activity of proteoliposomes was assayed as described (26Casey R.P. Ariano B.H. Azzi A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 122: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 27Napiwotzki J. Kadenbach B. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) by measuring the rate of oxidation of ferrocytochrome c (0.2–0.8 mm) at 550 nm in a final volume of 1 ml using a Cary-1E spectrophotometer (Varian Instruments, Walnut Creek, CA). Assay for PKA and PKC Activity—The PKA activity was measured using a kit from Calbiochem, which combines affinity binding and ultra-filtration and uses a 32P-labeled biotinylated peptide substrate. Assays were carried out as per the manufacturer's recommended protocol. The PKC activity (specific for Ca2+-dependent isoforms) was measured following partial purification on DEAE-Sephacel microcolumns using a kit from Invitrogen. The assay system employs a PKC-specific peptide substrate and a pseudosubstrate inhibitor in 50-μl volumes using 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Electrophoresis of Proteins and Immunoblot Analysis—Proteins were subjected to electrophoresis on 12–18% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). The conditions for immunoblot analysis of proteins were similar to those described before (12Vijayasarathy C. Biunno I. Lenka N. Yang M. Basu A. Hall I.P. Avadhani N.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1371: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The immunoblots were developed using the Super Signal ULTRA chemiluminescent substrate kit from Pierce. The blots were imaged and quantified in a Bio-Rad Fluor-S imaging system. Developing Holoenzyme Antibody to CcO—CcO enzyme from beef heart mitochondria was purified using a combination of (NH4)2SO4 fractionation and DEAE chromatography (29Fuller S.D. Capaldi R.A. Henderson R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2525-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). New Zealand female rabbit (2.0 kg) was immunized by subcutaneous injection with 200 μgof CcO in complete Freund's adjuvant using standard procedures. The total serum proteins were fractionated with (NH4)2SO4 for enriching the IgG fraction (30Boopathi E. Lenka N. Prabu S.K. Fang J.K. Wilkinson F. Atchison M. Giallongo A. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35242-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The polyclonal antibody interacted with at least 11 of the 13 subunits and immunoprecipitated intact CcO containing all 13 subunits (results not shown). Assay of ROS Production—Mitochondrial oxidative stress was evaluated by superoxide production using two different methods for detection of ROS. The lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence method was used as described by Li et al. (31Li Y. Zhu H. Kuppusamy P. Roubaud V. Zweier J.L. Trush M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2015-2023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), using a Turner Designs TD-20/20 luminometer. Briefly, freshly isolated mitoplasts or SMP (100–200 μg of protein) were used in a 200-μl assay system containing 0.5 mm NAD(P)H with or without added 0.1 mm reduced ferrocytochrome c as electron donor, and inhibitors of respiratory complexes, rotenone (2.5 μm), antimycin A (10 μm), and myxothiazol (10 μm), for the assay of ROS. Chemiluminescence was initiated by adding 5 μm lucigenin, and light emission was recorded every 60 s for 5–10 min and was expressed as mean arbitrary light unit per min per mg of protein as described before (32Raza H. Prabu S.K. Robin M.A. Avadhani N.G. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It was shown previously that at the substrate level of 5 μm used, the nonspecific signal due to redox recycling of lucigenin is insignificant (31Li Y. Zhu H. Kuppusamy P. Roubaud V. Zweier J.L. Trush M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2015-2023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). ROS generation was also measured by the dichlorofluorescein fluorescence method modified from LeBel et al. (33LeBel C.P. Ali S.F. McKee M. Bondy S.C. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1990; 104: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Stable nonfluorescent DCF-DA (1 mm in methanol) was used in a 1-ml assay mixture containing reconstituted membrane vesicles as described above. In whole cells, DCF-DA is hydrolyzed by cellular esterases to a nonfluorescent DCF. DCF is then rapidly oxidized by peroxy radicals to highly fluorescent dichlorofluorescein. Because mitochondria or reconstituted membrane vesicles may have limited esterase activity to convert DCF-DA to DCF, we have used a partially purified enzyme fraction from rat brain cytosol (10 μg of protein/ml of reaction). The cytosolic enzyme was purified by (NH4)2SO4 fractionation (45–80% saturation) followed by dialysis for 16 h. Appropriate controls were used to normalize the effect of cytosol alone on ROS generation. In some cases, the ROS were also measured in the presence of SOD (30 units/ml) or catalase (10 units/ml), both from Sigma. The fluorescence was recorded by using a spectrofluorometer LPS-220B from Photon Technology International at an excitation at 488 nm and emission at 525 nm for 20 min. Assay of Other Respiratory Complexes—Respiratory complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase), complex II (succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase), and complex III (ubiquinol:ferrocytochrome c oxidoreductase) activities were measured in the freshly prepared mitochondrial membrane fraction from macrophages or rabbit heart essentially as described by Birch-Machin and Turnbull (34Birch-Machin M.A. Turnbull D.M. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 97-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Data from the cultured macrophages and isolated heart studies were presented as means ± S.D. Differences between paired variables were determined using two-tailed Student's t tests for paired data. Differences among nonpaired variables were evaluated using a single factor analysis of variance followed by individual comparisons using two-tailed Student's t test for nonpaired data. p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Effects of cAMP and PKA Inhibitors on CcO Activity in Cultured Macrophages—Ours and a number of other studies reported altered CcO activity in cells subjected to hypoxia (6Vijayasarathy C. Damle S. Prabu S.K. Otto C.M. Avadhani N.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 871-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 11Giordano F.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). In this study we evaluated the possible role of protein phosphorylation in altered enzyme activity in cultured macrophages. Initially, CcO activity was assayed by the DAB substrate method using digitonin-permeabilized cells. This system allowed the assaying of CcO activity under membrane lipid conditions that closely mimic in vivo conditions. A low concentration of digitonin (23Chrzanowska-Lightowers Z.M.A. Turnbull D.M. Nightowlers R.N. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) used for cell permeabilization inflicts minimal damage to the inner membrane-associated enzyme complex and the lipid environment. It is seen from Fig. 1A that treatment with H89 (50 nm) and MPI (50 nm), both specific inhibitors of PKA or Go6850 (10 nm), which inhibits the α, β, δ, and ζ forms of PKC, had no significant effect on the CcO activity in cells grown under normoxic conditions. Under identical assay conditions, cells grown under hypoxia for 10 h showed about 55% inhibition of CcO activity, which was nearly completely reversed by added H89 or MPI (50 nm each). Go6850 (10 nm), however, had no detectable effect on the hypoxia-mediated inhibition of CcO activity. A significant change in cardiolipin content of mitochondrial inner membrane during ischemia (35Paradies G. Petrosillo G. Pistolese M. Ruggiero F.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 323-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) has been implicated as an important cause of altered CcO activity during ischemia/reperfusion. With a view to clearly resolve the contribution of altered cardiolipin content on enzyme activity from those associated with protein modification, we used the liposome-reconstituted system (27Napiwotzki J. Kadenbach B. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This system allows activity measurements of enzyme reconstituted in liposomes with defined cardiolipin composition. Fig. 1B shows that H89 or MPI (50 nm each) had no inhibitory effect on reconstituted enzyme from normoxic cells, whereas Go6850 had a marginal inhibitory effect. Enzyme from hypoxia-grown cells, however, showed nearly 60% inhibition of activity, which was nearly completely reversed by added H89 or MPI. Go6850, on the other hand, did not significantly reverse the hypoxia-mediated inhibition. Consistent with the H89- and MPI-mediated reversal of CcO activity, the PKA activity was induced 2–3-fold in both the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions of cells subjected to hypoxia (Fig. 1C). The results also showed that H89 or MPI included in the culture medium markedly reduced the PKA activity, whereas Go6850 had only a marginal effect. These results showed that mitochondrial CcO activity is markedly inhibited during hypoxia, and that at least part of this inhibitory effect was probably because of direct changes in subunit composition or modification. The possible subunit modification during hypoxia was investigated by immunoprecipitation of the CcO complex with holoenzyme antibody, which immunoprecipitates the intact or nearly intact complex. The immunoprecipitated complex was further analyzed for subunit phosphorylation. In Fig. 1, D and E, the immunoprecipitated CcO complexes from normoxic or hypoxic cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and two identical blots were probed either with CcO holoenzyme antibody (Fig. 1D) or antibody to Ser phosphate (Fig. 1E). As shown in Fig. 1E, 1st lane, the enzyme complex from normoxic cells resolved into multiple components. In the gel system used, subunits II and III, subunits VIa, -b, and -c, and subunits VIIa and -b and VIII comigrated forming complex bands. Additionally, the antibody interacted poorly with subunit Va such that a minor band was visible only when the gels were overloaded. Results also showed that the complex immunoprecipitated from hypoxic cells showed notable differences, including significantly lower contents of subunits I, IVi1, and Vb. Furthermore, the hypoxia-mediated reduction in these subunits was nearly completely reversed by H89 or MPI (50 nm each), suggesting a possible role for PKA-mediated phosphorylation. The immunoblot in Fig. 1E, probed with antibody to Ser phosphate, shows no detectable phosphorylation of CcO subunits from normoxic cells, whereas subunits I, IVi1, and Vb were found hyperphosphorylated in CcO from cells exposed to hypoxia. Furthermore, H89 and MPI (50 nm each) markedly reduced the level of phosphorylation of these subunits, confirming the role of PKA. These results suggested that the reduced CcO activity during hypoxia is related to reversible phosphorylation of subunits I, IVi1, and Vb and possible changes in subunit stoichiometry. The role of PKA-mediated phosphorylation on CcO activity was further evaluated by increasing the cellular cAMP level in cultured macrophage cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, the CcO activity was progressively inhibited by dibutyryl cAMP (100 μm) by about 38 and 60%, respectively, at 30 and 60 min of exposure. Cultures supplemented with 50 nm H89, on the other hand, showed only marginal inhibition of 5 and 15%, respectively. Fig. 2B shows that under these growth conditions both the mitochondrial and cytosolic levels of PKAα, the catalytic subunit, were increased in a time-dependent manner, with a nearly 5-fold increase at the 60-min time period. Results of immunoprecipitation of the CcO complex with holoenzyme antibody showed that similar to what was shown in hypoxia-grown cells, addition of dibutyryl cAMP caused a selective subunit reduction and subunit phosphorylation. Fig. 2C shows that the levels of subunits I and Vb were reduced markedly in a time-dependent manner, whereas subunit IVi1 was reduced marginally. The immunoblot with antibody to Ser phosphate (Fig. 2D) shows that subunits I, IVi1, and Vb were hyperphosphorylated, and the level of phosphorylation increased with increasing time of treatment with dibutyryl cAMP. These results confirmed that increased PKA levels that cause hyperphosphorylation of CcO subunits lead to inhibition of enzyme activity. Inhibition of CcO Activity during Ischemic Injury through a PKA-mediated Process—The effects of ischemia in the myocardial tissue on CcO activity were studied using in vitro perfused rabbit hearts subjected to focal ischemia by anterior coronary artery occlusion or global ischemia as described under “Materials and Methods” (21Spear J.F. Moore E.N. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2002; 39: 761-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The region of damage was identified with the snare in place by the lack of staining with india ink and was excised for enzyme activity. The sham-control hearts showed no indication of ischemic damage after 3 h of perfusion (data not shown). Fig. 3A shows that in rabbit hearts subjected to gl"
https://openalex.org/W1987550772,"Chlorophyll is the most abundant photosynthetic pigment in higher plants. During senescence, chlorophyll is hydrolyzed, resulting in the release of free phytol and chlorophyllide. Although the degradation of chlorophyllide has been studied in depth, the metabolic fate of phytol in plants is less clear. Here, we provide evidence that phytol can be incorporated into chlorophyll, tocopherol, and lipid esters by Arabidopsis seedlings. Phytol is phosphorylated to phytyl-phosphate and phytyl-diphosphate by two successive kinase activities associated with chloroplast envelope membranes of Arabidopsis. Although phytol kinase is CTP-dependent, the second kinase reaction, phytyl-phosphate kinase, shows broader specificity for CTP, GTP, UTP, and ATP. Therefore, in addition to de novo synthesis from geranylgeranyl-diphosphate, phosphorylation of free phytol represents an alternative route for phytyl-diphosphate production as the precursor for chloroplast prenyl lipid synthesis. Lipid esters are produced after feeding phytol to Arabidopsis seedlings, and they also accumulate in large amounts in leaves during senescence. The predominant phytyl ester that accumulates during senescence is hexadecatrienoic acid phytyl ester. Fatty acid phytyl ester synthesis by protein extracts of Arabidopsis is stimulated in the presence of phytol- and acyl-CoA esters. Thus, Arabidopsis contains a distinct enzymatic machinery for redirecting free phytol released from chlorophyll degradation into chloroplast lipid metabolism.

Isoprenoids represent one of the most diverse classes of naturally occurring compounds. In plants, photosynthetic pigments (i.e. carotenoids and chlorophyll) are derived from isoprenoid biosynthesis. Furthermore, electron carriers of photosynthesis (plastoquinone, phylloquinone), respiration (ubiquinone), and antioxidants (tocopherol) contain isoprenyl side chains (1Lange B.M. Ghassemian M. Plant Mol. Biol. 2003; 51: 925-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Two pathways for isoprenoid synthesis exist in higher plants, the mevalonate pathway localized to the cytosol and the methylerythritol-phosphate pathway found in plastids (2Arigoni D. Sagner S. Latzel C. Eisenreich W. Bacher A. Zenk M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10600-10605Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 3Lichtenthaler H.K. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 47-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). Plastid isoprenoid metabolism largely depends on the methylerythritol-phosphate pathway. However, some exchange of isoprenoid units between the plastid and the cytosol seems to occur (4Laule O. Fürholz A. Chang H.-S. Zhu T. Wang X. Heifetz P.B. Gruissem W. Lange B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6866-6871Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Geranylgeranyl-diphosphate plays an important role in plastid isoprenoid metabolism, because it is the precursor for the synthesis of carotenoids, tocotrienols, chlorophyll, and phytyl-diphosphate (phytyl-PP). 3The abbreviations used are: phytyl-PP, phytyl-diphosphate; phytyl-P, phytyl-phosphate; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; FW, fresh weight. 3The abbreviations used are: phytyl-PP, phytyl-diphosphate; phytyl-P, phytyl-phosphate; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; FW, fresh weight. The existence of two pathways for chlorophyll synthesis was suggested. The first is the direct transfer of a phytyl group onto chlorophyllide from phytyl-PP at the envelope membrane, and the second is the geranylgeranylation of chlorophyllide at the thylakoid membranes (5Soll J. Schulz G. Rüdiger W. Benz J. Plant Physiol. 1983; 71: 849-854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Keller et al. (6Keller Y. Bouvier F. d'Harlingue A. Camara B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) identified an Arabidopsis cDNA encoding geranylgeranyl reductase. This enzyme was proposed to convert geranylgeranyl-diphosphate into phytyl-PP and, in addition, to reduce the geranylgeranylated form of chlorophyll to (phytyl-)chlorophyll. A large fraction of phytyl-PP is channeled into chlorophyll synthesis via chlorophyll synthase. Furthermore, two additional prenylquinone lipids in the plastid are derived from phytyl-PP, tocopherol (vitamin E) (7Collakova E. DellaPenna D. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1113-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and phylloquinone (vitamin K) (8Shimada H. Ohno R. Shibata M. Ikegami I. Onai K. Ohto M.-a. Takamiya K.-i. Plant J. 2005; 41: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Previous studies suggest that a second, geranylgeranyl-diphosphate-independent pathway for phytyl-PP synthesis might be operating in higher plants. Feeding of free phytol to safflower cell cultures results in an increase in tocopherol synthesis (9Furuya T. Yoshikawa T. Kimura T. Kaneko H. Phytochemistry. 1987; 26: 2741-2747Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). During senescence, the ester bond of chlorophyll is cleaved by chlorophyllase, resulting in the release of large amounts of chlorophyllide and phytol. The degradation pathway of chlorophyllide has been studied in detail, but the fate of phytol derived from chlorophyll breakdown is less clear (10Tsuchiya T. Ohta H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Shimada H.

Life Sci. 1999; 56: 330-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, the fact that chlorophyll degradation and tocopherol synthesis during senescence coincide in many plants has led to the hypothesis that phytol released from chlorophyll by hydrolysis might be channeled into tocopherol synthesis via a salvage pathway (13Rise M. Cojocaru M. Gottlieb H.E. Goldschmidt E.E. Plant Physiol. 1989; 89: 1028-1030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Peisker C. Düggelin T. Rentsch D. Matile P. J. Plant Physiol. 1989; 135: 428-432Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Homogentisate phytyltransferase converts homogentisate and phytyl-PP into 2-methyl-6-phytylbenzoquinol, an intermediate of tocopherol synthesis (7Collakova E. DellaPenna D. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1113-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation of free phytol is a prerequisite for its incorporation into tocopherol. Soll et al. (15Soll J. Kemmerling M. Schultz G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 204: 544-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) reported on the phosphorylation of phytol with ATP by stromal protein extracts from spinach chloroplasts. It remained unknown whether ATP represents the preferred phosphate donor for phytol phosphorylation, and it was unclear whether phytyl-PP synthesis is mediated by two successive phosphorylations or in a one-step mechanism. In addition to chlorophyll, another class of phytyl esters was detected in plants, i.e. fatty acid phytyl esters (14Peisker C. Düggelin T. Rentsch D. Matile P. J. Plant Physiol. 1989; 135: 428-432Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 16Csupor L. Planta Med. 1971; 19: 37-40Crossref Google Scholar, 17Patterson G.W. Hugly S. Harrison D. Phytochemistry. 1993; 33: 1381-1383Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, the conditions under which fatty acid phytyl esters accumulate, their exact composition, and biosynthetic pathway remained unclear. To address the question of whether plants contain a salvage pathway for phytyl-PP synthesis in addition to de novo synthesis and to corroborate the hypothesis that phytol released from chlorophyll can enter the tocopherol biosynthetic pathway, radioactive labeling experiments were done with Arabidopsis seedlings and protein extracts. From these experiments, it became clear that Arabidopsis contains two enzyme activities for the phosphorylation of phytol and phytyl-phosphate (phytyl-P) and that a large fraction of phytol is deposited in the form of fatty acid phytyl esters. Plant Growth Conditions—Plants (Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Col-0) for protein extraction or chloroplast isolation were grown on soil for 3 weeks under greenhouse conditions (16 h of light, 120 μmol m–2 s–1, 20 °C, 60% humidity). Prior to harvest, plants were dark-adapted for 24 h. Plants used in feeding experiments were grown on Murashige and Skoog (18Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (52758) Google Scholar) medium containing 1% sucrose for 2 weeks at 16 h of light, 120 μmol m–2 s–1, 22 °C, 70% humidity. In addition to the wild type (Col-O), the following Arabidopsis mutant plants affected in tocopherol synthesis were employed for feeding experiments: vte1, deficient in tocopherol cyclase (19Porfirova S. Bergmüller E. Tropf S. Lemke R. Dörmann P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12495-12500Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar); vte2 (hpt1), deficient in homogentisate phytyltransferase (20Havaux H. Eymery F. Porfirova S. Rey P. Dörmann P. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 3451-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar); and vte4 (tmt1), deficient in γ-tocopherol methyltransferase (21Bergmüller E. Porfirova S. Dörmann P. Plant Mol. Biol. 2003; 52: 1181-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Preparation of Protein Extracts—Plant leaves (0.5 g) were homogenized in 1 ml of extraction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm isoascorbate, 1 mm KCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and filtered through Miracloth. A leaf protein extract was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min for the separation into a pellet (membranes) and supernatant fraction (soluble proteins). Protoplasts for chloroplast isolation were obtained by digesting ∼20 gof Arabidopsis wild-type leaves (22Fitzpatrick L.M. Keegstra K. Plant J. 2001; 27: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Protoplasts were resuspended in breakage buffer (300 mm sorbitol, 20 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaHCO3, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and ruptured by filtration through a 20-μm nylon mesh and chloroplasts resuspended in grinding buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.3, 0.33 m sorbitol, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) (22Fitzpatrick L.M. Keegstra K. Plant J. 2001; 27: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Chloroplasts were isolated by centrifugation on a step gradient consisting of 50 and 80% Percoll for 10 min at 6000 × g. The chloroplast band at the interface was harvested, diluted with homogenization buffer, and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min. Intact chloroplasts were resuspended in 3 ml of 0.6 m sucrose in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) and ruptured by grinding with a glass mortar. After diluting the broken chloroplasts to a concentration of 0.2 m sucrose with TE buffer, the suspension was loaded on a sucrose step gradient (0.45 or 1.0 m in TE) and centrifuged for 2 h at 180,000 × g. While the pellet at the bottom of the gradient mostly contained thylakoids, a fraction enriched in envelopes was harvested from the interphase of 0.45 and 1 m sucrose (23Perry S.E. Keegstra K. Plant Cell. 1994; 8: 93-105Google Scholar). The envelope and thylakoid fractions were diluted with 0.2 m sucrose in TE, centrifuged at 180,000 × g for 30 min, and the membrane pellets resuspended in extraction buffer (see above). Western analysis of the different subplastidial fractions was done with polyclonal antiserum against the transport complex protein of the inner chloroplast envelope TIC40 (generously provided by Prof. Jürgen Soll, Ludwig Maximilians University, Munich, Germany) according to Ref. 24Gaude N.

Synthesis of [32P]Phytyl-P—[γ-32P]CTP was obtained from [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, Hartmann Analytic, Braunschweig, Germany) and CDP using nucleoside 5′-diphosphate kinase from yeast (Sigma) (25Crick D.C.

The reaction (30 mm CDP, 10 mm MgCl2, 80 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 units of enzyme, and 200 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in a total volume of 100 μl) was carried out at room temperature for 2 h, and the product was directly used for the following phosphorylation step. [32P]Phytyl-P was synthesized from phytol (33 mm) and 17 pmol of [γ-32P]CTP (see above) by incubating 150 μl of leaf protein in 4 mm MgCl2, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 0.05% CHAPS in a total volume of 250 μl. After 60 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped and lipids extracted three times with 500 μl of water-saturated n-butyl alcohol each. The combined organic phases were evaporated under nitrogen gas, and lipids (containing ∼100 nCi of radioactivity, >90% in the form of phytyl-P as estimated by TLC) were redissolved in 0.25% CHAPS and used for phytyl-P kinase assays. Phytol Kinase, Phytyl-P Kinase, and Phytol Esterification Assays—If not stated otherwise, all assays were carried out using 30 μl of plant protein extract in 4 mm MgCl2, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 0.05% CHAPS in a total volume of 50 μl. The substrate was either 100 pmol of [1-3H]phytol (20 Ci/mmol, American Radiolabeled Company/BioTrend, Cologne, Germany) or 5 nCi of [32P]phytyl-P (see previous paragraph). NTPs were added at a concentration of 200 μm each. For phytol esterification assays, 100 pmol of [1-3H]phytol, 50 μm oleic acid (18:1), or 50 μm acyl-CoA (16:0-CoA, 18:1-CoA) were added to leaf protein extracts. After 30 or 60 min at 30 °C, the reactions were stopped and lipids were extracted twice with 100 μl each of water-saturated n-butyl alcohol, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 3 min to obtain phase separation. The n-butyl alcohol phases were combined and evaporated under nitrogen gas. The samples were dissolved in a small volume of water-saturated n-butyl alcohol and loaded on a silica 250-PA TLC plate (Mallinckrodt Baker, Griesheim, Germany). The plate was developed with isopropyl alcohol/ammonia (32%)/H2O (6:3:1) (27Ohnuma S.-i. Watanabe M. Nishino T. J. Biochem. 1996; 119: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Phytyl-PP was identified by co-chromatography with a commercial radioactive standard (American Radiolabeled Company/BioTrend, Cologne, Germany). 3H-labeled compounds were quantified using a TLC β-scanner (Automatic TLC Linear Analyzer, Berthold, Wildbad, Germany). Autoradiography was done with phosphorimaging screens (BAS-TR 2040S and BAS-MP 2040S screens for 3H and 32P; Fuji Film/Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany), which were scanned on a BAS-1500 imaging analyzer. Alternatively, tritiated lipids on TLC plates were detected by fluorography after spraying with En3hance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Phytol kinase activity was calculated based on the conversion of [1-3H]phytol to the sum of [1-3H]phytyl-P and [1-3H]phytyl-PP, and phytyl-P kinase activity was calculated based on the production of [1-3H]phytyl-PP. Uptake Experiments with [1-3H]Phytol and Non-radioactive Phytol—Arabidopsis seedlings (50 mg; 3 weeks old) were incubated in the light for 24 h in incubation buffer (1 ml of 20 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.2% Tween 80) containing 100 pmol of [1-3H]phytol. After washing the seedlings three times with incubation buffer, they were frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenized. Lipids were extracted twice with 1.5 ml of chloroform/methanol/0.9% aqueous NaCl (2:1:1) and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 3 min. Organic phases were combined, evaporated under nitrogen gas, and redissolved in a small volume of chloroform/methanol (2:1). Lipid extracts were separated by TLC (silica 250-PA) developed with hexane/diethylether/acetic acid (85:15:1). Radioactive lipids were identified by co-migration with non-radioactive standards. Tritiated chlorophyll a and b was isolated from the silica material of the TLC plate with 1.5 ml of chloroform/methanol/0.9% aqueous NaCl (2:1:1). The organic solvent of one portion of the extracted chlorophyll was evaporated with N2 gas and chlorophyll hydrolyzed with 0.9 ml of 10% methanolic KOH and 0.1 ml of 0.9% aqueous NaCl. Phytol released from chlorophyll was extracted with hexane and rechromatographed by TLC using the same solvent system (hexane/diethylether/acetic acid, 85:15:1). Uptake experiments with non-radioactive phytol were done with 500 mg of Arabidopsis seedlings in 20 ml of incubation buffer containing 0.1% of phytol (mixture of cis-/trans-isomers; Sigma). The commercial phytol was shown to contain a mixture of trans- and cis-isomers in a ratio of ∼2:1 (67.5 trans-, 32.5% cis-isomers) by gas chromatography of phytol after silylation with MSTFA (N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyl-trifluoroacetamide). Plants were incubated in the light for 48 h and then further processed as described for [1-3H]phytol feeding experiments. Characterization of Fatty Acid Phytyl Esters by GC-MS—Total lipids were extracted from Arabidopsis seedlings incubated with phytol or from senescing leaves with chloroform/methanol (2:1). Subsequently, non-polar lipids were separated from membrane lipids by chromatography on a silica column (Kieselgel 60, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) with three volumes of chloroform/methanol (2:1), and the lipid esters were isolated by TLC as described for phytol feeding experiments. GC-MS was done using an HP 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a 5973 inert mass selective detector (Agilent Technologies, Böblingen, Germany). Esters were directly injected onto the GC-MS column (HP-5MS, 0.25 cm × 30 m × 0.25 μm, Agilent). The temperature gradient was from 140 to 330 °C in 38 min and hold at 330 for 5 min and then from 330 to 140 °C in 9.5 min. Standards of fatty acid phytyl esters were synthesized from phytyl (mixture of cis-/trans-isomers, Sigma) and different fatty acids (15:0, pentadecanoic acid; 16:0, palmitic acid; 18:1, oleic acid; 18:3, α-linolenic acid; Sigma) as described previously (28Gellerman J.L. Anderson W.H. Schlenk H. Lipids. 1975; 10: 656-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Standards of 15:0-phytol and 18:3-phytol were purified by TLC and quantified by gas chromatography (Flame Ionization Detector, Agilent) after transmethylation of fatty acid methyl esters using 18:3 or 15:0 as the internal standard, respectively. Fatty acid phytyl esters were quantified by GC-MS after the addition of 18:3-phytol and 15:0-phytol as internal standards using total ion chromatograms. 16:0-phytol which has a retention time very close to 16:3-phytol was quantified using the peak area of the extracted ion chromatogram of m/z 278.3 specific for saturated fatty acid phytyl esters. Phytol Is Incorporated into Chlorophyll, Tocopherol, and Lipid Esters by Seedlings of Arabidopsis—Phytyl-PP serves as the activated precursor for the biosynthesis of different isoprenoid lipids, including chlorophyll, tocopherol, and phylloquinone. Although free phytol is not an intermediate of isoprenoid biosynthesis, it is generated by chlorophyllase during senescence or stress. To study the metabolism of free phytol in plants, Arabidopsis seedlings were incubated with radioactive [1-3H]phytol and lipids analyzed by TLC and autoradiography. Fig. 1A shows that a large amount of [1-3H]phytol was incorporated into chlorophyll, α-tocopherol, and a band co-migrating with long chain fatty acid alcohol esters. The phytylation of lipids originated from enzymatic reactions present in the seedlings, because it was not observed in seedlings deactivated by boiling prior to incubation. Arabidopsis mutants affected in tocopherol synthesis were employed for feeding experiments to corroborate the hypothesis that [1-3H]phytol was incorporated into α-tocopherol. Indeed, no tritiated α-tocopherol was detected in the vte1 and hpt1 mutants deficient in all forms of tocopherol (19Porfirova S. Bergmüller E. Tropf S. Lemke R. Dörmann P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12495-12500Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 20Havaux H. Eymery F. Porfirova S. Rey P. Dörmann P. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 3451-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). In the tmt1 mutant deficient in α-tocopherol, a radioactive band co-migrating with γ-tocopherol accumulated, in agreement with the previous finding that γ-tocopherol methyltransferase activity is abolished in this plant (21Bergmüller E. Porfirova S. Dörmann P. Plant Mol. Biol. 2003; 52: 1181-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To provide evidence that externally added [1-3H]phytol was also employed for chlorophyll synthesis, chlorophyll was isolated by TLC after [1-3H]phytol feeding of seedlings and hydrolyzed by alkaline treatment. Rechromatography of the hydrolysis products revealed the presence of tritiated phytol, demonstrating that free [1-3H]phytol was incorporated into chlorophyll under these conditions (Fig. 1B). Phytol Phosphorylation Is CTP-dependent and Localized to Chloroplast Envelopes—Incorporation of phytol into lipids depends on activation to phytyl-PP. Therefore, it was important to know whether plants contain enzyme activities capable of converting phytol into phytyl-PP. Incubation of protein extracts from Arabidopsis leaves with [1-3H]phytol in the presence of all four nucleotides resulted in the synthesis of phytyl-P and phytyl-PP (Fig. 2A). Deactivation by boiling totally abolished phytyl-P and phytyl-PP synthesis, indicating that the phosphorylation reactions were enzyme-mediated. The conversion of phytol to phytyl-P was strongly stimulated by the addition of nucleotides, indicating that it was catalyzed via a kinase reaction (Fig. 2B). Incubation of protein extracts with [1-3H]phytol and single nucleotides (ATP, GTP, UTP, and CTP) revealed that the phytol kinase shows highest activity with CTP but lower activity with GTP, UTP, and ATP. The specific activity for CTP was ∼7 times higher as compared with the other three nucleotides (Fig. 2B). Protein extracts from Arabidopsis leaves were separated into a soluble and insoluble fraction by centrifugation. Enzyme assays with [1-3H]phytol and all four NTPs revealed that the specific activity for phytol kinase was very high in the insoluble fraction, and most of the total measurable phytol kinase activity of whole leaves localized to the insoluble material (Table 1).TABLE 1Subcellular localization of phytol kinase and phytyl-P kinase activities in ArabidopsisPhytol kinase activityPhytyl-P kinase activitypmol mg-1 min-1% of whole leafpmol mg-1 min-1% of whole leafWhole leaf4.2 ± 0.21000.25 ± 0.03100Insoluble protein7.1 ± 0.4850.52 ± 0.0597Soluble protein0.8 ± 0.1150.01 ± 0.013 Open table in a new tab Chloroplasts were isolated from protoplasts derived from Arabidopsis leaves and further separated into an envelope and a thylakoid-rich fraction. Western blotting revealed that the inner envelope protein TIC40 was highly enriched in the envelope fraction but that thylakoids still contained residual amounts of envelope proteins (Fig. 2C). Enzyme assays done with different chloroplast fractions showed that phytol kinase activity was highly abundant in the envelope fraction (Fig. 2D). The activities for phytol kinase and phytyl-P kinase were at least 10-fold higher as compared with thylakoids. Therefore, the enzymes responsible for phytol phosphorylation presumably are localized to chloroplasts, most likely to the envelope membrane fraction. Phytol Is Converted to Phytyl-PP by Two Successive Kinase Reactions—A possible pathway for phytyl-PP synthesis is the transfer of a diphosphate group from CTP onto phytol in a one-step process. Such a pyrophosphorylation reaction would depend on only one enzymatic activity. In this scenario, the occurrence of phytyl-P in radioactive labeling experiments as observed in Fig. 2 might be derived from dephosphorylation of phytyl-PP by a phosphatase and thus might represent a side reaction of this pathway. Alternatively, the synthesis of phytyl-PP might be mediated by two successive kinase reactions. To distinguish between these two possibilities, radioactive [γ-32P]CTP was synthesized from [γ-32P]ATP and subsequently employed for phosphorylation assays of phytol with a plant protein extract. Autoradiography of lipids separated by TLC showed that a large amount of radioactivity from [γ-32P]CTP was incorporated into phytyl-P and a smaller amount into phytyl-PP (Fig. 3). The radioactive labeling of phytyl-P withγ-phosphate of [γ-32P]CTP cannot be explained by a one-step transfer of a diphosphate group and subsequent dephosphorylation, because this would lead to the loss of the radioactive phosphate group, but is consistent with a two-step mechanism of phytyl-P and phytyl-PP production. These results are analogous to the phosphorylation pattern observed for farnesol in tobacco cell cultures (26Thai L. Rush J.S. Maul J.E. Devarenne T. Rodgers D.L. Chappell J. Waechter C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13080-13085Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A large amount of [32P]phytyl-P was produced and isolated for kinase assays after incubation of phytol and [γ-32P]CTP with a plant protein extract. To study the nucleotide specificity of the phytyl-P kinase reaction, plant extracts were incubated with [32P]phytyl-P and different nucleotides. The addition of all four nucleotides resulted in the stimulation of phytyl-PP synthesis, indicating that this reaction is NTP-dependent (Fig. 4). However, phytyl-P phosphorylation was similar when the four nucleotides were used in single reactions, suggesting that the phytyl-P kinase has broad nucleotide specificity. The phytyl-P kinase activity was highest with GTP, but the activities with the other three nucleotides (UTP, CTP, and ATP) were only slightly lower. Phytyl-PP synthesis in the absence of nucleotides still amounted to 39% as compared with assays done in the presence of all four nucleotides. Presumably, protein extracts still contained considerable amounts of NTPs, in particular ATP. Phytyl-P kinase assays with [32P]phytyl-P and all four NTPs were done with a soluble and insoluble protein extract isolated from Arabidopsis leaves. The specific phytyl-P kinase activity of the insoluble fraction was higher as compared with whole leaf extracts (Table 1). Furthermore, a large amount of total phytyl-P kinase activity was associated with the pellet fraction. This suggests that the protein responsible for the second phosphorylation step is poorly soluble or associated with membranes. Phosphorylation assays of chloroplast fractions with [1-3H]phytol showed that, similar to phytol kinase, a high activity for phytyl-P kinase was detected in chloroplast envelope membranes (Fig. 2, C and D). Phytol Is Incorporated into Fatty Acid Phytyl Esters in Seedlings of Arabidopsis—Radioactive [1-3H]phytol is taken up by Arabidopsis seedlings and incorporated into different lipids, including a lipid co-migrating with long chain fatty acid alcohol esters (Fig. 1). Therefore, lipid esters accumulating after [1-3H]phytol feeding were tentatively identified as fatty acid phytyl esters. For unambiguous characterization, lipid esters extracted from Arabidopsis seedlings were isolated by TLC and analyzed by GC-MS. The retention times and spectra of candidate peaks were compared with synthetic standards (16:0-phytol, 18:1-phytol, 18:3-phytol). However, in the GS-MS chromatogram of control Arabidopsis seedlings, the peaks co-migrating with fatty acid phytyl ester standards were very small (Fig. 5A, bottom trace). Arabidopsis seedlings were incubated with non-radioactive phytol and lipid esters analyzed by TLC and GC-MS (Fig. 5A, top trace). High amounts of fatty acid phytyl esters accumulated after phytol feeding, which co-migrated and showed the same mass spectra as the respective standards (Fig. 5). Phytyl esters of the same fatty acid eluted as two peaks with nearly identical sp"
https://openalex.org/W1987003850,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths worldwide and is highly correlated with hepatitis virus infection. Our previous report shows that a DEAD box RNA helicase, DDX3, is targeted and regulated by hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein, which implicates the involvement of DDX3 in HCV-related HCC development. In this study, the potential role of DDX3 in hepatocarcinogenesis is investigated by examining its expression in surgically excised human HCC specimens. Here we report the differential deregulation of DDX3 expression in hepatitis virus-associated HCC. A significant downregulation of DDX3 expression is found in HCCs from hepatitis B virus (HBV)-positive patients, but not from HCV-positive ones, compared to the corresponding nontumor tissues. The expression of DDX3 is differentially regulated by the gender and, moreover, there is a tendency that the downregulation of DDX3 expression in HCCs is more frequent in males than in females. Genetic knockdown of DDX3 with small interfering RNAs (siRNA) in a nontransformed mouse fibroblast cell line, NIH-3T3, results in a premature entry to S phase and an enhancement of cell growth. This enhanced cell cycle progression is linked to the upregulation of cyclin D1 and the downregulation of p21WAF1 in the DDX3 knockdown cells. In addition, constitutive reduction of DDX3 expression increases the resistance of NIH-3T3 cells to serum depletion-induced apoptosis and enhances the ras-induced anchorage-independent growth, indicating the involvement of DDX3 in cell growth control.

Steady-state kinetics with the Y-family Sulfolobus solfataricus DNA polymerase IV (Dpo4) showed 90-fold higher incorporation efficiency of dCTP > dATP opposite 8-oxoG and 4-fold higher efficiency of extension beyond an 8-oxoG:C pair than an 8-oxoG:A pair. The catalytic efficiency for these events (with dCTP or C) was similar for G and 8-oxoG templates. Mass spectral analysis of extended DNA primers showed ≥95% incorporation of dCTP > dATP opposite 8-oxoG. Pre-steady-state kinetics showed faster rates of dCTP incorporation opposite 8-oxoG than G. The measured Kd,dCTP was 15-fold lower for an oligonucleotide containing 8-oxoG than with G. Extension beyond an 8-oxoG:C pair was similar to G:C and faster than for an 8-oxoG:A pair, in contrast to other polymerases. The Ea for dCTP insertion opposite 8-oxoG was lower than for opposite G. Crystal structures of Dpo4 complexes with oligonucleotides were solved with C, A, and G nucleoside triphosphates placed opposite 8-oxoG. With ddCTP, dCTP, and dATP the phosphodiester bonds were formed even in the presence of Ca2+. The 8-oxoG:C pair showed classic Watson-Crick geometry; the 8-oxoG:A pair was in the syn:anti configuration, with the A hybridized in a Hoogsteen pair with 8-oxoG. With dGTP placed opposite 8-oxoG, pairing was not to the 8-oxoG but to the 5′ C (and in classic Watson-Crick geometry), consistent with the low frequency of this frameshift event observed in the catalytic assays.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3171-3172PubMed Google Scholar). Although 8-oxoG can be oxidized further to spiro products that are even more mutagenic in some assay systems (14Henderson P.T. Delaney J.C.

Slade P.G. Martin B.D. Sugden K.D. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2005; 18: 1378-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of miscoding by 8-oxoG has been the subject of investigation since the discovery of this lesion in DNA. Originally the lesion was reported as 8-hydroxyguanine; NMR studies (17Culp S.J. Cho B.P. Kadlubar F.F. Evans F.E. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1989; 2: 416-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) defined the structure as the tautomer 8-oxoG, with chemistry of the N-7 atom changed from that of a nucleophile to an amide nitrogen. In all biological systems examined, a proclivity for binding to or insertion of A is observed. The Tm for the 8-oxoG:A pair is ∼6 °C lower than a normal T:A pair, but the Tm for the 8-oxoG:C pair in the same context is 35 °C lower than for a G:C base pair (18McAuley-Hecht K.E. Leonard G.A. Gibson N.J. Thomson J.B. Watson W.P. Hunter W.N. Brown T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10266-10270Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Thus one might expect pairing of an A with 8-oxoG to be favored over that of a C (with 8-oxoG) from thermodynamic considerations. NMR and x-ray diffraction studies of 8-oxoG pairing in oligonucleotides have been reported, and the similarity of an 8-oxoG:A pair to a T:A pair has been noted (18McAuley-Hecht K.E. Leonard G.A.

Essigmann J.M. Williams L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Another feature of the binding of 8-oxoG to A in double-stranded oligonucleotides is the anti to syn shift of the 8-oxoG glycosidic bond, yielding a flip of the base to change the position of the atoms and facilitate pairing to A. Although the insertion of A opposite 8-oxoG is the most common outcome (and subsequently yields a G to T transition), the biological response varies considerably (21Hogg M. Wallace S.S. Doublie S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 86-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In early work in the field, Shibutani et al. (22Shibutani S. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Nature. 1991; 349: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2047) Google Scholar) noted considerable variation among polymerases in their tendencies to insert dATP versus dCTP. Although the parameters used in the literature vary, the extent of misincorporation ranges from about 5 to 95% among different DNA polymerases (22Shibutani S. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P.

On the basis of steady-state kinetic parameters, E. coli polymerases I and II (exo-), bacteriophage pol T7, rat pol β, and bovine pol δ insert dATP opposite 8-oxoG in 30–50% of the events (23Lowe L.G.

Nature. 2004; 431: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) are particularly prone to insert dATP > dCTP. Of the DNA polymerases reported, only RB69 (26Freisinger E. Grollman A.P. Miller H. Kisker C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1494-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae pol η (30Carlson K.D. Washington M.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2169-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 32Haracska L. Yu S.L. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) insert dCTP in ∼95% of the incorporation events instead of dATP. Furthermore, the patterns of incorporation of 8-oxo-dGTP opposite template C versus A do not match the patterns of incorporation of dCTP versus dATP opposite 8-oxoG, indicating the asymmetry of the system (25Einolf H.J. Schnetz-Boutaud N. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13300-13312Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Another issue is the variable tendency of DNA polymerases to extend beyond 8-oxoG:C lesions. To date reports on individual DNA polymerases indicate a general tendency to extend primers more efficiently beyond the 8-oxoG:A than the 8-oxoG:C pairs (22Shibutani S. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Nature. 1991; 349: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2047) Google Scholar, 23Lowe L.G. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9840-9849Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 24Furge L.L.

Prakash L. Prakash S. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Four x-ray structures of DNA polymerases bound to oligonucleotides containing 8-oxoG have been reported to date (26Freisinger E. Grollman A.P. Miller H. Kisker C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1494-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 27Hsu G.W. Ober M. Carell T. Beese L.S. Nature. 2004; 431: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 28Krahn J.M.

Doublie S. Kunkel T.A. Ellenberger T.

Grollman A.P. Wilson S.H. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 121-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Most of the work with 8-oxoG done to date has been with replicative DNA polymerases and relatively little has been done with the more recently discovered translesion polymerases, except for the yeast pol η studies already mentioned (30Carlson K.D. Washington M.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2169-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 32Haracska L. Yu S.L. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). A recent Carlson and Washington (30Carlson K.D. Washington M.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2169-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) article with S. cerevisiae pol η is of note in that pre-steady-state kinetics indicated that the efficiency (kpol/Kd) for dCTP opposite 8-oxoG was still ∼50% that of the opposite G, which is unusual compared with our own work with replicative polymerases (23Lowe L.G. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9840-9849Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 24Furge L.L. Guengerich F.P.

Chem. 2000; 275: 16316-16322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Archebacter DNA polymerase Dpo4 is a model for translesion synthesis (for a recent discussion of mechanisms, see Ref. 35Vaisman A. Ling H. Woodgate R. Yang W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2957-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We analyzed the interaction of Dpo4 with 8-oxoG using MS, steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetics, and x-ray crystallography. Although the translesion DNA polymerases are often assumed to be rather error prone, we find that Dpo4 shows high fidelity in inserting dCTP opposite 8-oxoG and that this pair is very efficiently extended. Consistent with the activity data, the crystal structures of ternary complexes of Dpo4 with dCTP and ddCTP opposite 8-oxoG reveal standard Watson-Crick geometry of the pairs. Conversely, dATP forms a Hoogsteen pair with 8-oxoG, with the latter adopting syn geometry. All three complexes belong to the “Type I” crystal form described for the ternary complexes with native DNA (36Ling H. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Yang W. Cell. 2001; 107: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Thus, 8-oxoG constitutes the single template base present at the active site. However, in both complexes with dCTP and ddCTP the primer was extended by a single C and, in the complex with dATP, the structural data indicate the presence of a second nucleoside triphosphate immediately adjacent to the active site. The complexes with dGTP and ddGTP belong to the “Type II” form (36Ling H. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Yang W. Cell. 2001; 107: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), with two template bases present at the active site, whereby 8-oxoG is skipped and the nucleoside triphosphates engage in a Watson-Crick base pair with the C 5′-adjacent to the modified base. This arrangement is similar to that found in the ternary complex of dGTP with a template-primer construct containing 1,N2-ethenodeoxyguanosine (37Zang H. Goodenough A.K. Choi J.-Y. Irimia A. Loukachevitch L.V. Kozekov I.D. Angel K.C. Rizzo C.J. Egli M. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol.

Reagents—Dpo4 was expressed in E. coli and purified using heat denaturation, Ni2+-nitriloacetate chromatography, and ion-exchange chromatography are as described elsewhere (37Zang H. Goodenough A.K. Choi J.-Y. Irimia A. Loukachevitch L.V. Kozekov I.D. Angel K.C. Rizzo C.J. Egli M. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol.

(Midland, TX) and purified using HPLC by the manufacturer, with analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption-time of flight MS. Polymerization Assays and Gel Electrophoresis—A 32P-labeled primer, annealed to either an unmodified or adducted template, was extended in the presence of the individual dNTPs (Scheme 1). In the preliminary “run-on” assays, each reaction was initiated by adding 2 μl of dNTP-Mg2+ solution (final concentrations of 250 μm of each dNTP and 5 mm MgCl2) to a preincubated E·DNA complex (final concentrations of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 100 nm DNA duplex, 100 nm Dpo4, 5 mm DTT, 50 μg of bovine serum albumin ml-1, 50 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol (v/v)) at 37 °C, yielding a total reaction volume of 8 μl. After varying lengths of time, reactions were quenched with 50 μl of 20 mm EDTA (pH 9.0) in 95% formamide (v/v). Aliquots (3 μl) were separated by electrophoresis using denaturing gels containing 8.0 m urea and 16% acrylamide (w/v) (from a 19:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide solution (w/w), AccuGel, National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) with 80 mm Tris borate buffer (pH 7.8) containing 1 mm EDTA. The gel was exposed to a phosphorimager screen (Imaging Screen K, Bio-Rad) overnight. The bands (representing extension of the primer) were visualized with a phosphorimaging system (Bio-Rad, Molecular Imager® FX) using the manufacturer's Quantity One Software, version 4.3.0. Steady-state Kinetics—Unless indicated otherwise, all Dpo4 reactions were performed at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) containing 5% glycerol (v/v), 5 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, and 50μg of bovine serum albumin ml-1. For both unmodified and modified templates, the molar ratio of the primer-template to enzyme was 10:1 to 40:1, and the reactions were done at eight dNTP concentrations (reaction time of 20 s to 3 min). LC-MS Analysis of Oligonucleotide Products from Dpo4 Reactions—Dpo4 reactions were performed at 37 °C for 4 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) containing 5% glycerol (v/v), 5 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 100 μg of bovine serum albumin ml-1. The reactions were done with 10 μm oligonucleotide substrate, 5 μm Dpo4, and four dNTPs at 1 mm each, in a final reaction volume of 100 μl. The reaction was terminated by extraction of excess dNTPs using a spin column (Bio-Spin 6 chromatography column, Bio-Rad). To the above filtrate (120 μl), concentrated Tris-HCl, DTT, and EDTA were added to restore the initial concentrations, and uracil DNA glycosylase solution was added (20 units) (37Zang H. Goodenough A.K. Choi J.-Y. Irimia A. Loukachevitch L.V. Kozekov I.D. Angel K.C. Rizzo C.J. Egli M. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29750-29764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 6 h to hydrolyze the uracil residue on the extended primer. The final reaction mixture was then heated at 95 °C for 1 h in the presence of 0.25 m piperidine, followed by removal of solvent by lyophilization. The dried residues were dissolved in 100 μl of H2O for the following MS analysis. MS was performed on a DecaXP ion trap instrument (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA). Separation of oligonucleotides was carried out with a Jupiter microbore column (1.0 × 150 mm, 5 μm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). Buffer A contained 10 mm NH4CH3CO2 (pH 6.8) and 2% CH3CN (v/v); buffer B contained 10 mm NH4CH3CO2 (pH 6.8) and 95% CH3CN (v/v). The following gradient program was used with a flow rate of 1. 0 ml min-1: 0–2 min, hold at 100% A; 2–20 min, linear program to 100% B; 20–30 min, hold at 100% B; 30–31 min, linear program to 100% A; 31–40 min, hold at 100% A (for next injection). The desired oligonucleotide products were eluted at ∼8 min. A pre-column “Tee” set-up was applied, with only 10% of the total flow infused to the ion source. The fast flow rate helped reduce the equilibration time of the column, and thus the retention time of the oligonucleotides was consistent between runs. Samples were infused using an autosampler, with 8 μl withdrawn from a 50-μl reaction. Electrospray conditions were: source voltage, 3.4 kV; source current, 8.5 μA; sheath gas flow rate setting, 28.2; auxiliary sweep gas flow rate setting, 4.3; capillary voltage, -49 V; capillary temperature, 230 °C; and tube lens voltage, -67 V. MS/MS conditions were: normalized collision energy, 35%; activation Q, 0.250; time, 30 ms; 1 scan. Product ion spectra were acquired over the m/z 250–2000 range. The abundant ions from LC-MS spectra were selected for CID analysis, and the cut-off was set above ∼15% of the most abundant ion. When more than one ion came from a single species, the peak responding to the doubly charged parent ion was chosen for fragmentation analysis. The calculations of the CID fragmentations of a certain oligonucleotide sequence were done using a program linked to the Mass Spectrometry Group of Medicinal Chemistry at the University of Utah. Pre-steady-state Kinetics—Pre-steady-state kinetics were performed using a KinTek model RQF-3 chemical quench flow apparatus (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX) with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) buffer in the drive syringes. The reactions were initiated by mixing the pre-equilibrated polymerase-DNA complex (containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 200 nm 32P-labeled DNA duplex, 5 mm DTT, 100 μg of bovine serum albumin ml-1, 50, 200, or 300 nm Dpo4, 50 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol (v/v)) in sample syringe A (12.5 μl) with either dNTP-Mg2+ (40–400 μm dNTP, depending on the oligonucleotide sequence) or 10 mm MgCl2 from syringe B (10.9 μl) at 37 °C. The reactions were quenched with 0.6 m EDTA (pH 9.0) in syringe C after reaction times that varied from 0.1 to 30 s. Reactions were combined with 500 μl of formamide dye solution (20 mm EDTA, 95% formamide (v/v), and 0.05% bromphenol blue (w/v)), and the components were separated by electrophoresis (3 μl of the sample) on a denaturing gel, with analysis as described for gel electrophoresis of polymerization reactions. The resulting plot (of product concentration versus time) was fit to the burst equation, y = A(1 - e-kpt) + ksst, where A represents burst amplitude, kp is the pre-steady-state rate of nucleotide incorporation, t is time, and kss is the steady-state rate of nucleotide incorporation, and analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 3.0a (San Diego, CA). In subsequent analyses with multiple dNTP concentrations, the results were fit to the hyperbolic expression kp = (kpol·[dNTP])/([dNTP] + Kd, dNTP), using GraphPad Prism. Crystallization of Dpo4-DNA Complexes—For the crystallizations of ternary complexes with either ddNTPs or dNTPs we used the 18-mer template 5′-TCAC(8-oxoG)GAATCCTTCCCCC-3′ (2, Scheme 1) and the 13-mer primer 5′-GGGGGAAGGATTC-3′ (1, Scheme 1). All Dpo4 crystallizations were performed as described (37Zang H. Goodenough A.K. Choi J.-Y. Irimia A. Loukachevitch L.V. Kozekov I.D. Angel K.C. Rizzo C.J. Egli M. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29750-29764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), with the exception that the concentrations of the nucleoside triphosphates were either 1 or 5 mm, and the concentrations of d(dNTP) in the cryoprotectant solutions were 5 mm. Only Ca2+ was added to the annealing and reservoir solutions and EDTA was used to mask traces of Mg2+ in all experiments. Crystals were also grown of a binary complex between the 18-mer template (2, Scheme 1) and the 14-mer primer 5′-GGGGGAAGGATTCC-3′ (3, Scheme 1) with C opposite 8-oxoG. Although these crystals diffracted to high resolution, they showed persistent twinning and we subsequently did not pursue structure determination of that particular product complex. X-ray Diffraction Data Collection and Processing—Diffraction data sets for Dpo4 ternary complex crystals were collected at 110 K using a synchrotron radiation wavelength of 1.0 Å on beamlines at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne, IL (SER-CAT BM-22, Dpo4-dGTP = Dpo4-dG; IMCA-CAT ID-17, Dpo4-dCTP = Dpo4-dC and Dpo4-ddCTP = Dpo4-ddC; DND-CAT ID-5, Dpo4-ddGTP = Dpo4-ddG), or at the Advanced Light Source (ALS), Berkeley, CA (8.2.1, Dpo4-dATP = Dpo4-dA) (Table 1). The high resolution limit of diffraction for these crystals lies within a range of 2.27 to 2.6 Å. Data to 3.13-Å resolution were also collected for the Dpo4-ddA complex but this structure was not refined. Indexing and scaling with the Dpo4-dG and Dpo4-ddG complexes were performed using the program X-GEN (38Howard A.J. Bourne P.E. Watenpaugh K.D. Crystallographic Computing 7: Proceedings from the Macromolecular Crystallographic Computing School. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK2000Google Scholar); for the Dpo4-dA, Dpo4-dC, and Dpo4-ddC complexes the program XDS (39Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1988; 21: 916-924Crossref Scopus (1680) Google Scholar) was used. Autoindexing and systematic absences indicated the space group P21212 for all structures. The data were further processed using CCP4 package programs, including the truncate procedure performed with TRUNCATE (40French G.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1978; 34: 517-525Crossref Scopus (895) Google Scholar). The resulting data sets for the Dpo4-dG and Dpo4-ddG complexes are of very good quality as indicated by R-merge values of 7.4 and 6.2%, respectively. The Dpo4-dA, Dpo4-dC, and Dpo4-ddC data sets show slightly inferior quality because of high mosaicity, the R-merge values are 9.4, 12.0, and 12.5%, respectively (see Table 1 for statistics of data processing and data quality). It should also be noted that the crystals formed by the Dpo4-dA, -dC, and -ddC ternary complexes in general had a higher tendency to be twinned.TABLE 1Crystal data and refinement parameters for the ternary Dpo4-DNA-dNTP (ddNTP) complexesParameterDpo4-dGDpo4-dADpo4-dCDpo4-ddGDpo4-ddCX-ray sourceAPS, SER-CATALSAPS, IMCA-CATAPS, DND-CATAPS, IMCA-CATBeamlineBM-228.2.1.ID-17ID-5ID-17DetectorMARCCDQuantum CCDQuantum CCDMARCCDQuantum CCDWavelength (Å)0.981.001.001.001.00Temperature (K)110110110110110No. of crystals11111Space groupP21212P21212P21212P21212P21212Unit cell (a, b, c; Å)93.27,103.91,52.4997.50,102.01,53.1096.03,100.39,52.4193.35,102.03,52.8395.20,100.15,52.00Resolution range (Å)32.47–2.5643.99–2.5644.49–2.6031.96–2.2742.99–2.55Highest resolution shellaValues in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shells(2.72–2.56)(2.72–2.56)(2.76–2.60)(2.42–2.27)(2.71–2.55)No. of measurements116,072166,58055,584168,88260,782No. of unique reflections17,10117,02214,98523,82716,653Redundancy6.789.783"
https://openalex.org/W2054429361,"The membrane redistribution and phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) have been reported to be important for cell migration. We previously showed that Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) induced FAK membrane redistribution and autophosphorylation in ovarian cancer SK-OV3 cells and the signaling pathway consisting of Gi-Ras-MEKK1 mediated LPA-induced FAK membrane redistribution but not FAK autophosphorylation. We also showed that the disruption of the Gi-Ras-MEKK1 pathway led to a significant reduction in LPA-stimulated cell migration. These findings raised the question of whether LPA-induced FAK autophosphorylation was required for LPA-stimulated cell migration and what signaling mechanism was involved in LPA-induced FAK autophosphorylation. In this study, we expressed the membrane anchored wild-type FAK (CD2-FAK) in SK-OV3 cells and found that the expression of CD2-FAK greatly rescued LPA-stimulated cell migration in Gi or Ras-inhibited cells. However, Gi inhibitor pertussis toxin or dominant-negative H-Ras still significantly inhibited LPA-stimulated cell migration in cells expressing the membrane anchored FAK containing a mutation in the autophosphorylation site [CD2-FAK(Y397A)]. These results suggest that FAK autophosphorylation plays a role in LPA-stimulated cell migration. With the aid of p115RhoGEF-RGS, G12 and G13 minigenes to inhibit G12/13, we found that the G12/13 pathway was required for LPA-induced FAK autophosphorylation and efficient cell migration. Moreover, LPA activated RhoA and Rho kinase (ROCK) in a G12/13-dependent manner and their activities were required for LPA-induced FAK autophosphorylation. However, Rho or ROCK inhibitors displayed no effect on LPA-induced FAK membrane redistribution although they abolished LPA-induced cytoskeleton reorganization. Our studies show that the G12/13-RhoA-ROCK signaling pathway mediates LPA-induced FAK autophosphorylation and contributes to LPA-stimulated cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2091676715,"Glucocorticoid hormones induce apoptosis in lymphoid cells. This process is transcriptionally regulated and requires de novo RNA/protein synthesis. However, the full spectrum of glucocorticoid-regulated genes mediating this cell death process is unknown. Through gene expression profiling we discovered that the expression of thioredoxin-intereacting protein (txnip) mRNA is significantly induced by the glucocorticoid hormone dexamethasone not only in the murine T-cell lymphoma line WEHI7.2, but also in normal mouse thymocytes. This result was confirmed by Northern blot analysis in multiple models of dexamethasone-induced apoptosis. The induction of txnip mRNA by dexamethasone appears to be mediated through the glucocorticoid receptor as it is blocked in the presence of RU486, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist. Deletion and mutation analysis of the txnip promoter identified a functional glucocorticoid response element in the txnip promoter. Reporter assays demonstrated that this glucocorticoid response element was necessary and sufficient for induction of txnip by dexamethasone. Expression of a GFP-TXNIP fusion protein was sufficient to induce apoptosis in WEHI7.2 cells, and repression of endogenous txnip by RNA interference inhibited dexamethasone-induced apoptosis in WEHI7.2 cells. Together, these findings indicate that txnip is a novel glucocorticoid-induced primary target gene involved in mediating glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1966189442,"Proline oxidase (POX) is a redox enzyme localized in the mitochondrial inner membrane. We and others have shown that POX is a p53-induced gene that can mediate apoptosis through generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) ligand troglitazone was found to activate the POX promoter in colon cancer cells. PPARγ ligands have been reported to induce apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells. In HCT116 cells expressing a wild-type PPARγ, troglitazone enhanced the binding of PPARγ to PPAR-responsive element in the POX promoter and increased endogenous POX expression. Blocking of PPARγ activation either by antagonist GW9662 or deletion of PPAR-responsive element in the POX promoter only partially decreased the POX promoter activation in response to troglitazone, indicating also the involvement of PPARγ-independent mechanisms. Further, troglitazone also induced p53 protein expression in HCT116 cells, which may be the possible mechanism for PPARγ-independent POX activation, since POX has been shown to be a downstream mediator in p53-induced apoptosis. In HCT15 cells, with both mutant p53 and mutant PPARγ, there was no effect of troglitazone on POX activation, whereas in HT29 cells, with a mutant p53 and wild type PPARγ, increased activation was observed by ligand stimulation, indicating that both PPARγ-dependent and -independent mechanisms are involved in the troglitazone-induced POX expression. A time- and dose-dependent increase in POX catalytic activity was obtained in HCT116 cells treated with troglitazone with a concomitant increase in the production of intracellular ROS.

Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1985; 25: 91-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). POX converts proline to pyrroline 5-carboxylate (P5C) and transfers electrons into mitochondrial electron transport with an intervening flavoprotein (1Phang J.M. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1985; 25: 91-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). These interconversions form a metabolic shuttle of redox equivalents between cytosol and mitochondria, couple the oxidation of NADPH to mitochondrial electron transport, and serve as a mechanism for energy production (1Phang J.M.

Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2246) Google Scholar) showed that POX is a p53-induced gene; we and others have shown that hyperexpression of POX in cancer cells is sufficient for initiating the apoptotic cascade (4Donald S.P.

A. 2000; 97: 13009-13014Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) belongs to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily and functions as a ligand-dependent transcription factor (6Willson T.M. Brown P.J. Sternbach D.D. Henke B.R. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 527-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar). It is thought that PPARγ plays important physiological roles in regulating lipid metabolism and homeostasis and also is involved in control of many cellular processes (7Kersten K. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Nature. 2000; 405: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar, 8Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar). PPARγ forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor and activates target genes by binding to specific peroxisome proliferator-responsive elements (PPREs) located in the promoter regions of these genes. These PPREs usually consist of a direct repeat of the hexanucleotide AGGTCA sequence separated by one or two nucleotides (8Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar). Recent reports have demonstrated that PPARγ and its ligands are also important in control of tumor cell growth (9Michalik L. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). PPARγ is widely expressed in many malignant tissues, and PPARγ ligands induce terminal differentiation, cell growth inhibition, and apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells, including colon, gastric, breast, prostate, and lung (9Michalik L.

Putative endogenous ligands of PPARγ include the 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 as well as several polyunsaturated fatty acids (6Willson T.M. Brown P.J. Sternbach D.D. Henke B.R. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 527-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar). High affinity synthetic ligands that selectively activate PPARγ include the glitazones or thiazolidinediones (i.e. ciglitazone, troglitazone, pioglitazone, and rosiglitazone), a class of insulin-sensitizing drugs, some of which are presently used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus due to their effectiveness in controlling hyperglycemia (6Willson T.M. Brown P.J. Sternbach D.D. Henke B.R. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 527-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar). Apart from their antidiabetic activity, glitazones have potent anti-inflammatory effects and are of special interest, since they induce growth arrest and apoptosis in a broad spectrum of tumor cells (15Grommes C.

Since the glitazones cause mitochondrial depolarization, the mitochondria are reported to be the most likely source of ROS, which have been implicated in mediating PPARγ ligand-induced growth arrest and apoptosis. However, the mechanism of generation of ROS by PPARγ ligands is not clearly defined. The significance of ROS in intracellular signaling has now been relatively well documented (20Finkel T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 21Fleury C. Mignotte B. Vayssière J.L. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence has shown that diverse stimuli can increase intracellular oxygen radicals that evoke many cellular events, such as proliferation, gene activation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. The generation, transmission, and targeting of ROS signals may be essential events in the induction of apoptosis. In our earlier work, we have shown that the induction of p53 was accompanied by the induction of POX and by proline-mediated ROS generation (4Donald S.P. Sun X.Y. Hu C.A. Yu J. Mei J.M. Valle D. Phang J.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1810-1815PubMed Google Scholar). POX was demonstrated to generate ROS, which can initiate apoptosis by directly acting on the mitochondrial permeability core complex and affecting the mitochondrial permeability transition. PPARγ and its ligands have been shown to be important in several biological processes ranging from differentiation, regulation of metabolism, and maintenance of insulin sensitivity to control of cellular proliferation and inflammation. Therefore, pathways activated by PPARγ and its ligands are very important. Recently, there has been an increased awareness about the possible link between obesity, diabetes, and cancer, and also alterations in metabolic pathways may lead to cancer susceptibility (8Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar, 22Evans R.M. Barish G.D. Wang Y.X. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). Moreover, the signals that control bioenergetics have been linked to the regulation of cell survival and apoptosis (23Hammerman P.S. Fox C.J. Thompson C.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 586-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). POX is one of the mitochondrial metabolic redox enzymes; the increased cycling of proline through POX may alter the redox balance critical for regulation of cell growth and apoptosis. In the present paper, we have studied the regulation of POX gene expression. We have demonstrated that PPARγ ligand troglitazone can up-regulate the expression of POX, which is accompanied by increased ROS. From our results, we hypothesize that the induction of apoptosis by PPARγ ligands is mediated, at least in part, by activating POX gene expression, resulting in increased ROS generation. Reagents—Troglitazone, rosiglitazone, ciglitizone, and pioglitazone were purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI); GW9662 was obtained from Sigma. 2′,7′-Dichlorofluorescein diacetate was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Cell Culture—The human colon cancer cell lines HCT116, HCT15, HT29, KM12, HCC2998, and SW620 were provided by the NCI cell line repository. Two colon cancer cell lines RKO and LoVo and the HEK293 cell line were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. All of the cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Quality Biologicals, Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), penicillin and streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine at 37 °C, and 5% CO2. To test the effect of PPARγ ligands/antagonists, cells were refed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with or without ligands or GW9662 in Me2SO for various time periods. The final Me2SO concentration was 0.1%. Plasmid Constructs—A 1.26-kb genomic fragment containing a portion of the POX promoter sequence from –1250 to +10 relative to the translation initiation codon was amplified from genomic DNA. The primers used were as follows: forward, 5′-AAA CTC CGT GGG CCT TGG CAG CCC CT-3′; reverse, 5′-TCA GAG CCA TGG CGG GAC GGC GGT A-3′. The PCR amplification was performed in a final reaction volume of 50 μl under the following conditions: denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, and 3 min at 68 °C. The PCR product was cloned into the NheI and HindIII restriction sites of the pGL3 vector (Promega, Madison, WI) to generate the POX promoter-luciferase reporter construct (POX-Luc). The sequence was confirmed to be identical to the POX genomic sequences in the GenBank™ data base. The POX promoter sequence (–1250 to +10) was analyzed for potential transcription factor binding sites by the Transcription Element Search System (TESS) of the Computational Biology and Informatics Laboratory, School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania (available on the World Wide Web at www.cbil.upenn.edu/tess/) by using a 5-bp minimum element size limit. Another construct of the POX-Luc plasmid was also generated in which the POX promoter region (–1013 to –682) containing the PPRE was deleted by restriction digestion with PstI and BstXI. After digestion, the resulting overhangs were filled with Klenow and religated to generate a truncated POX-Luc construct containing a length of ∼900 bp of the POX promoter. A proline oxidase antisense vector was constructed by amplifying a part of the proline oxidase cDNA from bp 694–1782 and cloning it in the antisense orientation in the mammalian expression vector pCI (Promega). The POX antisense construct was validated to block the expression of POX mRNA by RT-PCR. The cloning of PPARγ and p53 was carried out by isolation of total RNA followed by RT-PCR using RT-PCR beads (Amersham Biosciences). The sequences for the PPARγ forward and reverse primers were 5′-GAT CGG TAC CAT GAC CAT GGT TGA CAC AGA-3′ and 5′-AGT CGT CGA CTA GTA CAA GTC CTT GTA GA-3′, and p53 forward and reverse primers were 5′-GAC ACT TTG CGT TCG GGC T-3′ and 5′-CGG GAC AAA GCA AAT GGA AGT-3′. The amplified PPARγ and p53 cDNAs were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCI (Promega). Luciferase Assay—POX transcriptional activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were co-transfected with the POX-Luc construct and pRL-null, a Renilla construct for normalizing transfection efficiency. To determine the effect of PPARγ/p53 on POX promoter activity, equivalent amounts of PPARγ/p53 cDNA or vector plasmid were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured with equal amounts of cell extract using a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA) and normalized with the Renilla activity. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—HCT116 cells were treated with 25 μm troglitazone for 36 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared using NE-PER™ nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. The protein concentration of the extracts was determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce), and samples were stored at –70 °C. The binding of PPARγ to the PPRE in the POX promoter region was studied, employing the Lightshift® chemiluminescent electrophoretic mobility shift assay kit (Pierce) as per the manufacturer's protocol. This method employs a nonisotopic method to detect DNA-protein interaction and uses biotin end-labeled DNA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays conducted using LightShift assays require biotin-labeled double-stranded DNA, with end labeling of both complementary oligonucleotides separately, followed by annealing at room temperature. The consensus oligonucleotide sequences (5′ to 3′) used were as follows: ATC ACA AGG TCA GGA GAT CAA GAC C (PPARγ, forward) and GGT CTT GAT CTC CTG ACC TTG TGA T (PPARγ, reverse). The biotin end-labeled DNA was detected using streptavidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate and a chemiluminescent substrate. The membrane was exposed to x-ray film (XAR-5; Amersham Biosciences) and developed with an Eastman Kodak Co. film processor. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—HCT116 cells treated with troglitazone for 36 h were incubated with 1% formaldehyde to fix protein-DNA complexes. Cells were resuspended in 200 μl of SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.1, complete proteinase inhibitor mixture) and sonicated on ice to shear DNA to an average length between 200 and 1000 bp. Sonicated samples were centrifuged to spin down cell debris, and the soluble chromatin was immunoprecipitated using a reagent kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) as recommended by the manufacturer. A portion of the sonicated chromatin was used as DNA input control and a no antibody control; the remaining DNA was then precipitated using specific antibody against PPARγ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The purified DNA from the immunoprecipitated complexes of antibody-protein-DNA was detected by PCR (30 cycles) using the specific primer pair spanning the POX promoter region (–1040 to –872) containing POX-PPRE: forward, 5′-CGT GGT GGC TCA CGC CTG TA-3′; reverse, 5′-ACG CCA TTC TCC CAC CTC AG-3′. RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from harvested cells using Trizol (Invitrogen) and quantified using a Beckman DU-65 spectrophotometer. A two-step RT-PCR (0.5 μg of total RNA, 0.5 μg of random primers, and 0.2 μm specific primers in a 50-μl volume) was performed using RT-PCR beads (Amersham Biosciences). The reaction mixture was incubated at 42 °C for 30 min. Specific oligomers unique to human 1) POX (forward, 5′-GCC ATT AAG CTC ACA GCA CTG GG-3′; reverse, 5′-CTG ATG GCC GGC TGG AAG TAG-3′) and 2) PPARγ-selective target gene keratin 20 (forward, 5′-AGT CAT GGC CCA GAA GAA CCT TCA-3′; reverse, 5′-TGG TCT CCT CTA GAG TGT GCT CCA AA-3′) were designed to amplify a product of 478 and 212 bp, respectively. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase control primers (Clontech) were used in a reaction with identical conditions, except that the reaction was performed for 20 cycles. All reaction products (15 μl with glycerol loading buffer) were run on a 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide, and the products were recorded and quantified using the Electrophoresis Documentation and Analysis System (Kodak Digital Science, Rochester, NY). Western Blotting—Cell lysates were prepared and quantified according to established methods. Equal amounts of cell lysates were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a semidry blotter (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked using Tris-buffered saline with 3% nonfat milk (pH 8.0; Sigma). Blots were then probed with the primary anti-POX or anti-p53 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in blocking buffer and subsequently by a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:2000). All blots were washed in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (pH 8.0; Sigma) and developed using the ECL procedure (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were routinely stripped by the Encore blot stripping kit (Novus Molecular, Inc., San Diego, CA) and reprobed with anti-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma) to serve as loading controls. Anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as secondary antibody. POX Enzyme Assay—HCT116 cells were grown in the appropriate medium, after which cells were rinsed and scraped in cold phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, and resuspended in cold sucrose buffer (0.250 m sucrose, 3.5 mm Tris, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4)). Suspensions were then sonicated for 20 s at a setting of 25% (Branson Sonifier 450; Branson Ultrasonics Corp., Danbury, CT). Total protein was determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). P5C formed was detected using a specific spectrophotometric method. Briefly, P5C formed from the substrate proline was reacted with O-aminobenzaldehyde (OAB) and the resultant OAB·P5C complex was quantified. A 200-μl reaction mixture containing 0.1 m KPO4, pH 7.2, 1.2 mg/ml OAB, 0.12 mg/ml cytochrome c, 5 mm proline, and cell extract containing 50 μg of protein was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 20 μl of OAB (10 μg/ml in 6 n HCl). The samples were centrifuged, and the absorbance of the supernatants was measured at 440 nm. All of the reactions were performed in triplicate, and proper protein controls were included for each measurement. A standard calibration curve was generated using P5C, and the P5C formed (nmol/min/μg of protein) was determined. Generation and Measurement of Intracellular ROS—HCT116 cells were cultured in 6-well plates in the growth medium for 24 h before treatment. Cells were then treated with PPARγ ligands/proline, as specified, for an additional 36 h before analysis for ROS. For inhibition studies, cells were treated with 1 mm N-acetyl cysteine 24 h before and concurrent with troglitazone/proline treatment. Cells were transfected with POX antisense or vector control and treated with troglitazone/proline, as specified before measurement of ROS. 2,7-Dichlorohydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA; Sigma) was used as an indicator of the amount of intracellular ROS. On the day of the experiment, treatment medium was removed, and the monolayer was exposed to serum-free, phenol red-free medium containing 50 μm DCF-DA. Cells were exposed to the dye for 30 min in the dark to allow for equilibration. After two washes with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were solubilized with 0.5% SDS and 5 mm Tris HCl (pH 7.5). The fluorescent intensity of the lysate was determined using a spectrofluorometer (Jovin Yvon Specs2) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 530 nm, respectively. Samples were assayed in triplicate. Data are shown as arbitrary units of fluorescence ± S.D. Effect of PPARγ Ligands on POX Promoter Activity—For investigating the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms involved in the basal expression of POX gene, we cloned the human POX promoter region (–1250 to +10) and produced a POX promoter/luciferase reporter construct. Analysis of the promoter nucleotide sequence revealed the presence of a number of potential transcription factor binding sites, including CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein, AP-1, Sp1, RAR, PPAR, and retinoid X receptor, which became the basis for our initial studies. By cotransfecting the POX-Luc construct with expression constructs of the several transcription factors in HEK293 cells, we determined which transcription factors stimulated POX promoter activity (data not shown). Among the different transcription factors tested, PPARγ was the most potent and resulted in a 6-fold activation of the POX promoter activity (Fig. 1A). Since PPARγ strongly activated the POX promoter, we characterized the interaction of PPARγ with POX in detail. PPARγ is a ligand-activated transcription factor; therefore, we next investigated if the PPARγ ligand troglitazone could further enhance the activation of POX promoter. HEK293 cells transfected with POX-Luc construct and PPARγ were treated with troglitazone for 24–36 h, and the POX promoter activity was monitored. As seen in Fig. 1A, troglitazone at a concentration of 25 μm further increased the POX promoter activity over PPARγ alone. High levels of PPARγ have been reported in several colon cancer cells, and the role of PPARγ and its ligands in cell growth arrest and apoptosis has been well documented (9Michalik L. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 10Yang W.L. Frucht H. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 1379-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Therefore, we transfected various colon cancer cell lines with a POX-Luc construct, and analyzed whether activation of endogenous PPARγ by treatment with its ligand stimulated POX promoter activity. As shown in Fig. 1B, all of the cell lines tested except for the HCT15 and SW620 cell lines activated the POX promoter activity in the presence of troglitazone (25 μm). Maximum activation of POX promoter activity was obtained in the HCT116 cells. To verify that the increase in POX activation was not only a troglitazone-specific effect, we measured the activation of POX in the presence of other PPARγ ligands in HCT116 cells (Fig. 1C). All of the PPARγ ligands tested increased the POX promoter activity, indicating that the activation may be mediated through PPARγ. Troglitazone Increases the Binding of PPARγ to the POX Promoter—Analysis of the POX promoter region revealed the presence of a putative PPAR/retinoid X receptor binding site (PPRE) between –982 and –969 bp relative to the transcription start site. Since the POX promoter activity was stimulated by troglitazone in the HCT116 cells and previous studies have shown that HCT116 cells express wild type and functional PPARγ (24Tsujie M. Nakamori S. Okami J. Hayashi N. Hiraoka N. Nagano H. Dono K. Umeshita K. Sakon M. Monden M. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 289: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we used these cells to study the functionality and binding of PPARγ to the PPRE in the POX promoter region by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay using an oligonucleotide probe of 25 bp containing the PPAR binding site. Incubation of nuclear extracts from HCT116 cells with the POX-PPRE probe increased the DNA binding activity of PPARγ, as shown in Fig. 2. The intensity of the bands was increased by treatment with 25 μm troglitazone for 36 h. To confirm the binding of PPARγ to the POX-PPRE in vivo, we also performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. In HCT116 cells treated with troglitazone, we observed a significant amplification of the POX promoter region containing the PPAR binding site (POX-PPRE) by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, demonstrating directly the interaction of PPARγ with POX-PPRE. Up-regulation of POX mRNA and Protein Expression by Troglitazone in HCT116 Cells—After the initial studies using the POX-Luc construct, we further investigated whether PPARγ and its ligands can effect the actual expression of endogenous POX. HCT116 cells expressing PPARγ were treated with troglitazone (25 μm) for various time periods, after which RNA was harvested, and the level of POX mRNA expression was determined by RT-PCR. A significant increase in the concentration of POX mRNA was observed in troglitazone-treated as compared with vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 3A). This effect occurred in a time-dependent manner. The expression of POX mRNA was observed within 12–24 h and peaked at 36 h of treatment, resulting in a 3–4-fold increase in POX transcript levels. To investigate whether changes in POX mRNA levels were associated with induction of the corresponding POX protein expression, HCT116 cells were treated with troglitazone at various concentrations and examined by Western analysis. Our results revealed that POX protein expression dose-dependently increased (3–4-fold) with troglitazone after 36 h of treatment, with maximal effects seen at 20–30 μm (Fig. 3B). Thus, mRNA induction correlates with increased POX protein expression in ligand-treated cells. To assess the time course of POX expression in response to troglitazone, HCT116 cells were treated with 25 μm troglitazone for various time periods, after which the level of POX protein expression was determined. Western blot analysis revealed that the POX protein expression was induced by 24 h and increased with time, with a maximum POX expression observed after 36 h (Fig. 3C). Increase in POX Enzymatic Activity Concomitant to POX Expression—A spectrophotometric assay that detects an o-aminobenzaldehyde-P5C complex formed by conversion of proline to P5C was used to determine whether troglitazone-induced POX expression results in increased POX catalytic activity. After troglitazone treatment at various concentrations and for various durations, HCT116 cells were harvested, and lysates were added to the reacti"

However, little is known about the regulation of CREB and ATF-1 activities and their phosphorylation within the tumor microenvironment. We analyzed the effect of platelet-activating factor (PAF), a potent phospholipid mediator of inflammation, for its ability to activate CREB and ATF-1 in eight cultured human melanoma cell lines, and we found that PAF receptor (PAFR) was expressed in all eight lines. In metastatic melanoma cell lines, PAF induced CREB and ATF-1 phosphorylation via a PAFR-mediated signal transduction mechanism that required pertussis toxin-insensitive Gαq protein and adenylate cyclase activity and was antagonized by a cAMP-dependent protein kinase A and p38 MAPK inhibitors. Addition of PAF to metastatic A375SM cells stimulated CRE-dependent transcription, as observed in a luciferase reporter assay, without increasing the CRE DNA binding capacity of CREB. Furthermore, PAF stimulated the gelatinase activity of MMP-2 by activating transcription and MMP-2 expression. MMP-2 activation correlated with the PAF-induced increase in the expression of an MMP-2 activator, membrane type 1 MMP. PAF-induced expression of pro-MMP-2 was causally related to PAF-induced CREB and ATF-1 phosphorylation; it was prevented by PAFR antagonist and inhibitors of p38 MAPK and protein kinase A and was abrogated upon quenching of CREB and ATF-1 activities by forced overexpression of a dominant-negative form of CREB. PAF-induced MMP-2 activation was also down-regulated by p38 MAPK and protein kinase A inhibitors. Finally, PAFR antagonist PCA4248 inhibited the development of A375SM lung metastasis in nude mice. This result indicated that PAF acts as a promoter of melanoma metastasis in vivo. We proposed that metastatic melanoma cells overexpressing CREB/ATF-1 are better equipped than nonmetastatic cells to respond to PAF within the tumor microenvironment.

Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2066) Google Scholar). The ubiquitously expressed CREB and ATF-1 and the preferentially expressed (in neuroendocrine tissues) CRE modulator bind to complete and partial palindromic CRE DNA consensus sites 5′-TGACGTCA-3′ and 5′-CGTCA-3′. These transcription factors induce genes involved in cellular metabolism and respiration, gene transcription, cell cycle regulation and cell survival, as well as growth factor and cytokine genes (reviewed in Ref. 1Mayr B. Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2066) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of the DNA-bound CREB protein dimers is regulated by phosphorylation of the serine 133 site in the kinase-inducible domain, which promotes recruitment of the transcriptional co-activator CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 (2Gonzalez G.A.

Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar). In response to elevated levels of cAMP caused by activation of guanine nucleotide-binding (G) protein-coupled receptors, CREB phosphorylation occurs as a result of activation and nuclear translocation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) (2Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2055) Google Scholar). Several growth factors and stress signals have been shown to induce CREB phosphorylation via mechanisms mediated by various other protein kinases, including protein kinase C, pp90RSK, AKT, MSK-1, MAP-KAP-2, calcium-calmodulin kinases II and IV, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) (4Bohm M.

CREB and ATF-1 expression levels correlate directly with the transition of human melanoma cells from the radial to the vertical growth phase and with their metastatic potential in an experimental nude mice model (4Bohm M.

We showed previously that quenching CREB and ATF-1 activities in metastatic melanoma cells by means of overexpression of a dominant-negative form of CREB, KCREB, which has a single base pair substitution in the DNA-binding domain (10Walton K.M. Rehfuss R.P. Chrivia J.C. Lochner J.E. Goodman R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 647-655PubMed Google Scholar), decreased melanoma tumorigenicity and metastatic potential in nude mice (11Xie S. Price J.E. Luca M. Jean D. Ronai Z. Bar-Eli M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2069-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown that intracellular expression of an inhibitory anti-ATF-1 single-chain antibody fragment in MeWo human melanoma cells suppressed their tumorigenicity and metastatic potential in vivo (12Jean D.

At least two mechanisms explain how CREB and ATF-1 overexpression contributes to the metastatic phenotype. (i) CREB and ATF-1 play essential roles in regulating the expression of the type IV matrix metalloproteinase 2 (gelatinase A), a key enzyme in melanoma invasion and metastasis, and of the adhesion molecule MCAM/MUC18 genes (11Xie S.

Meanwhile, melanoma is strongly associated with the inflammatory process (15Goulet A.C. Einsphar J.G. Alberts D.S. Beas A. Burk C. Bhattacharyya A. Bangert J. Harmon J.M. Fujiwara H. Koki A.

Among proinflammatory mediators, platelet-activating factor (PAF; 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) is becoming recognized as a major primary and secondary messenger involved in homotypic and heterotypic cell-to-cell communication that results in the activation of platelets, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and endothelial cells (21Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 419-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). At sites of acute and chronic inflammation, PAF mediates cell migration, aggregation, adhesion to endothelial cells, chemotaxis, degranulation, production of superoxide and inflammatory cytokines, and mitosis (21Prescott S.M.

PAF is synthesized from the 1-O-alkyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine via a reaction catalyzed by phospholipase A2/acetyl-CoA:lyso-PAF acetyltransferase, which also yields a COX-2 substrate, arachidonic acid (21Prescott S.M.

Tjoelker L.W. Camussi G. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 4214-4220PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, intraperitoneally injected PAF promoted experimental lung metastasis of B16F10 cells (34Im S.Y. Ko H.M. Kim J.W. Lee H.K. Ha T.Y. Lee H.B. Oh S.J. Bai S. Chung K.C. Lee Y.B. Kang H.S. Chun S.B. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2662-2665PubMed Google Scholar). PAF mediated the adhesiveness of Hs294T human melanoma cells and LS180 human colon cancer cells to IL-1-stimulated endothelial cells (35Mannori G. Barletta E. Mugnai G. Ruggieri S. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2000; 18: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, tumor necrosis factor-α, and thrombin have been shown to induce PAF production by human breast cancer cells in vitro and to induce PAF-dependent cell proliferation (36Bussolati B.

More importantly for melanoma tumorigenesis, keratinocytes secreted PAF in response to irradiation with ultraviolet light (37Pei Y. Barber L.A. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A. Kelley S.W. Dy L.C.

Moreover, the keratinocytes expressed PAFR, and PAF up-regulated the expression levels of COX-2, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 cells and the secretion levels of prostaglandin E2 (37Pei Y. Barber L.A. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A. Kelley S.W. Dy L.C. Fertel R.H. Nguyen T.M. Williams D.A. Travers J.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1954-1961PubMed Google Scholar, 38Walterscheid J.P. Ullrich S.E. Nghiem D.X. J.

Despite this knowledge, the role of PAF in the acquisition of the metastatic phenotype and the changes in gene expression in human melanoma cells have not been studied. In this study, we demonstrated that PAF induced CREB phosphorylation and activation in metastatic melanoma cells through the signaling cascade involving PAFR-mediated activation of pertussis toxin (Ptx)-insensitive Gαq protein, adenylate cyclase (AC), p38 MAPK, and PKA. Furthermore, PAF induced CREB-dependent expression and activation of MMP-2. Finally, we found that PAFR antagonists potently inhibited experimental melanoma lung metastasis. Taken together, our results proposed that compared with nonmetastatic cells, metastatic human melanoma cells that overexpress CREB and ATF-1 are better equipped to respond to inflammatory stimuli from the tumor microenvironment. Reagents and Antibodies—PAF, its metabolically stable analogue carbamyl-PAF (cPAF), PAFR antagonists PCA4248 and (±)-trans-2,5-bis(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-1,3-dioxolane (hereafter referred to as dioxolane), Ptx-insensitive G protein antagonist GPA-2A, AC inhibitor SQ22536, PKA inhibitor H-89, and p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 were obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-CREB (serine 133) antibody, rabbit polyclonal anti-CREB antibody, rabbit polyclonal anti-MMP-2 antibody, rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-p38 MAPK (threonine 180/tyrosine 182) antibody, rabbit polyclonal anti-p38 MAPK, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-PAFR (N terminus) and rabbit polyclonal anti-MT1-MMP antibodies were purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Fetal bovine serum was from Cambrex (Walkersville, MD). DNA Constructs—The CRE-driven luciferase reporter vector was generated by ligating one copy of the somatostatin gene promoter region (nucleotides -71 to +53), into the pGL3-Luc-Basic vector (Invitrogen). The original Somat-BgllI CAT construct reporter containing somatostatic gene promoter was obtained from Dr. Marc R. Montminy (Harvard Medical School, Boston). The MMP-2-driven luciferase reporter construct containing one copy of the human MMP-2 promoter gene region (nucleotides -393 to +290) was ligated into the pGL3-Luc-Basic reporter vector as described previously (39Mills L. Tellez C. Huang S. Baker C. McCarty M. Green L. Gudas J.M. Feng X. Bar-Eli M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5106-5114PubMed Google Scholar). pRSV-KCREB was kindly provided by Dr. Richard H. Goodman (Oregon Health Sciences, Portland). pRSV-KCREB expression plasmid contained full-length CREB cDNA with a single base pair substitution in the DNA-binding domain that causes a change from Arg287 to Leu287 (10Walton K.M. Rehfuss R.P. Chrivia J.C. Lochner J.E. Goodman R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 647-655PubMed Google Scholar). pRc/RSV construct (Invitrogen) lacking CREB cDNA was used as a control. pRL-CMV-BActin reporter vector was from Promega. Cell Culture—We used the following human melanoma cell lines with various metastatic potentials in the experimental nude mice model: nonmetastatic (SB2, DX3, and TXM40), moderately metastatic (TXM13, TXM18, and MeWo), and highly metastatic (WM2664 and A375SM); these eight cell lines are described elsewhere (40Luca M. Hunt B. Bucana C.D. Johnson J.P. Fidler I.J. Bar-Eli M. Melanoma Res. 1993; 3: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The highly metastatic A375SM human melanoma cell line, which was used for most of our experiments, was established from pooled lung metastases produced by parental A375 cells injected intravenously into nude mice (41Li L. Price J.E. Fan D. Zhang R.D. Bucana C.D. Fidler I.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1989; 81: 1406-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). All cells were routinely cultured in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% nonessential amino acids, 1% HEPES buffer, and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Generation of KCREB A375SM Clones—Generation of stable A375SM cell clones expressing the dominant-negative form of CREB, KCREB, was performed as described previously for MeWo cells (11Xie S. Price J.E. Luca M. Jean D. Ronai Z. Bar-Eli M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2069-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 13Jean D. Harbison M. McConkey D.J. Ronai Z. Bar-Eli M. J. Biol.

Briefly, 1 × 105 cells were transfected with 1 μg of the pRSV-KCREB or pRc/RSV construct by using 2 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Six hours later, the transfection medium was replaced with serum-containing growth medium. To select for stable transfectants, growth medium was supplemented with 2 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Expression of KCREB was verified by dual luciferase assay using pGL3-Luc construct driven by a somatostatin gene promoter containing four CREs. Transient Transfections and Luciferase Activity Assays—Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000. A total of 25 × 103 cells/well in a 24-well plate were transfected with 0.5 μg of the basic pGL3 expression vector with no promoter or enhancer sequence (pGL3-Basic) or with 0.5 μg of the pGL3/CRE-Luc or pGL3/MMP2-Luc expression construct. After 6 h, the transfection medium was replaced with serum-containing growth medium. PAF was added 24 h later, and after the relevant incubation period, the cells were harvested and lysed, and luciferase activity was assayed using a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) as instructed by the manufacturer. For each transfection, 30 ng of Renilla luciferase reporter pRL-CMV-BActin (Promega) was included to normalize for differences in transfection efficiency. Zymography—Zymographic assays were performed as described previously (11Xie S. Price J.E. Luca M. Jean D. Ronai Z. Bar-Eli M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2069-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 39Mills L. Tellez C. Huang S. Baker C. McCarty M. Green L. Gudas J.M. Feng X. Bar-Eli M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5106-5114PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after cells were incubated with PAF for 16 h, the medium was replaced with serum-free minimum essential medium. The conditioned medium was collected 16 h later and separated by electrophoresis in a polyacrylamide gel containing 1 mg/ml gelatin. The volume of supernatants loaded on the gel was normalized to the cell number. The gel was then washed at room temperature for 2 h with 2.5% Triton X-100 and, subsequently, at 37 °C overnight in a buffer containing 10 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The gel was stained with 0.5% Coomassie Blue and photographed on a light box. Proteolysis was detected as a white zone in a dark blue field. MMP-2 Activity Assay—Cells were treated as described for the zymography experiments except that the medium without phenol red was used in the last step of collecting the conditioned supernatants, which were analyzed for their ability to cleave a fluorogenic peptide substrate (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl-acetyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-3-(2,4-dinitrophenyl-l-2,3-diaminopropionyl)-Ala-Arg-NH2) as described by the manufacturer (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Briefly, the volume of supernatants was normalized to the cell number, and 100-μl aliquots were added to 10 μg of a substrate diluted in TCNB reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm CaCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 0.05% Brij). The fluorescence of the cleaved substrate was measured 16 h later (excitation wavelength 320 nm and emission wavelength 405 nm). A specific concentration of active MMP-2 was recalculated based on a standard curve obtained with recombinant human MMP-2 activated by 1 μm p-aminophenylmercuric acetate for 1 h at 37 °C in TCNB buffer. Western Blotting—Proteins of total cell extract (typically 15 μg) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon P transfer membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were washed in Tris-buffered saline with Tween (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) and blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween for 2 h at room temperature. The blots were then probed overnight with relevant antibodies at dilution of 1:1000 except for the anti-CREB antibody (1:2000) and anti-phospho-p38 MAPK anti-body (1:500). After 2 h of incubation with horseradish peroxide-conjugated secondary antibody, immunoreactive proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence per the manufacturer's instructions (ECL detection system; Amersham Biosciences). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The EMSA probe consisted of annealed synthetic complementary oligonucleotides containing the cAMP-binding consensus site (TGACGCTA) and was obtained from Promega. 32P-End-labeled oligonucleotides (20,000 cpm) were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 1 μg of nuclear extract in 20 μl of binding buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 4% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC). Competition reactions were performed with a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded CRE competitor DNA (Promega). For supershift analysis, the nuclear extracts were incubated with 1 μg of anti-CREB antibody for 1 h prior to the binding reaction with labeled probe. The DNA-protein complexes were separated on 4% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer. Detection of Apoptosis by Propidium Iodide (PI) Staining and Flow Cytometry—Cells at 90% confluency were exposed to the PAFR antagonist PCA4248, collected at various time points, washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in cold 70% ethanol overnight. Cells were then rehydrated using PBS, resuspended in PBS solution containing 50 μg/ml PI (Sigma) and 20 μg/ml RNase A, and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Cell cycle analysis was performed on a flow cytometer (Epics XL-MCL; Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) using MultiCycle software (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA). Confocal Microscopy—Cells were plated onto chamber slides and allowed to attach. After three brief PBS washes, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS, blocked in 5% normal horse serum, 1% normal goat serum/PBS, exposed to an anti-PAFR antibody (1:100) in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C and then exposed to a secondary goat anti-rabbit-Cy5 antibody (1:1200) for 1 h at room temperature, washed with PBS, exposed to 10 nmol/liter Sytox green for 10 min to stain nuclei, washed, and covered with propylgallate and coverslips for microscopic evaluation. Confocal microscopy was done with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope and LSM 510 Image Brower software (Carl Zeiss). MTT Assays—A375SM cells were plated onto 96-well plates (1 × 104 cells/well). Complete medium was supplemented with cPAF or PCA4248 at different concentrations. For the MTT analysis, cells were incubated with 1 mg/ml methyltetrazolium bromide for 3 h, after which the medium was replaced with dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), and resuspended. Absorbance was read at 570 nm using a Ceres UV900C microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT). Animals and Experimental Lung Metastasis Assays—Male athymic BALB/c nude mice were purchased from the NCI-Frederick Cancer Research Facility (Frederick, MD). The mice were housed in laminar flow cabinets under specific pathogen-free conditions and used at 8 weeks of age. Animals were maintained in facilities approved by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care and in accordance with current regulations and standards of the Department of Agriculture, Department of Health and Human Services, and the National Institutes of Health. For cell injection, A375SM cells in the exponential growth phase were harvested by brief exposure to 0.25% trypsin, 0.2% EDTA solution (w/v). Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion, and only single-cell suspensions of more than 90% viability were used. Cells were wa"

In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which Erbin regulates the Ras-Raf-MEK pathway. The N-terminal LRR domain was necessary and sufficient to inhibit neuregulin-activated expression of ϵ416-Luc, a reporter of ERK activation. On the other hand, Erbin had no effect on Ras activation, but it attenuated neuregulin-induced Raf activation, suggesting that Erbin may regulate Raf activation by Ras. Via the LRR domain, Erbin interacts with Sur-8, a scaffold protein necessary for the Ras-Raf complex. Expression of Erbin attenuated the interaction of Sur-8 with active Ras and Raf. Moreover, Erbin-shRNA, which suppressed Erbin expression at mRNA and protein levels, increased the interaction of Sur-8 with Ras and Raf, ERK activation, and neuregulin-induced expression of endogenous acetylcholine receptor ϵ-subunit mRNA. These results demonstrate a regulatory role of Erbin in the Ras-Raf-MEK pathway, suggesting that Erbin may inhibit ERK activation by disrupting the Sur-8-Ras/Raf interaction.

Upon activation, tyrosine residues in the carboxyl termini become phosphorylated and serve as docking sites for cytoplasmic signaling molecules such as Shc and Grb2 to activate various downstream signaling pathways. Grb2 brings guanyl nucleotide exchange factor (SOS) to the plasma membrane in proximity with Ras and expedites the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras (5Pawson T. Scott J.D.

Cells in 10-cm dishes (70–90% confluence) were incubated with 5.0 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 1.0 ml of E1-defective adenovirus lysates, 0.48 mg of DEAE-dextran, and 5 μg of plasmid DNA for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cell lysates (∼400 μg of protein) were incubated without or with indicated antibodies 1 h at 4 °C and subsequently with protein A- or protein G-agarose beads overnight at 4 °C on a rotating platform. After centrifugation, beads were washed five times with the modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with the SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell). Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated at room temperature for 1 h in blocking buffer containing Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween (TBS-T) and 5% milk or 5% bovine serum albumin, followed by incubation with indicated antibodies in the blocking buffer. After being washed three times for 5 min each with TBS-T, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) followed by washing. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). In some experiments, the nitrocellulose filter was incubated in a buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 2% SDS at 50 °C for 30 min and then washed with 0.1% Tween 20 in 50 mm Tris-buffered saline at room temperature for 1 h and reblotted with different antibodies. The following antibodies were used: FLAG (M2, Sigma), Myc (9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-Raf-1 (Ser-338, Upstate), phospho-MAPK (Promega), anti-Ras (clone RAS10, Upstate), GST (Biocompare), and Erbin (28Forsayeth J.R. Garcia P.D. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 354-358PubMed Google Scholar). For quantitative analysis, autoradiographic films were scanned with Epson Expression 1680, and the captured image was analyzed with NIH Image software.Luciferase Assay—C2C12 myoblasts were cotransfected with or without Myc-Erbin, plus the ϵ-subunit promoter-luciferase transgene that contains 416 nucleotides of the 5′-untranslated region of the ϵ-subunit gene (30Si J. Luo Z. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19752-19759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection, myoblasts were incubated in the differentiation medium to induce myotube formation. Myotube formation was completed 48 h after the switch to differentiation medium. C2C12 myotubes were stimulated with neuregulin at a final concentration of 10 nm at 37 °C for 24 h. pRL-SV40, which expresses Renilla luciferase under the control of the SV40 promoter (Promega), was cotransfected as a control to monitor the transfection efficiency. 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed, and the activities of the two different luciferases were assayed with their respective substrates with a dual luciferase assay kit (Promega).Ras Assay—Active GTP-bound Ras was precipitated by the minimal Ras-binding domain (RBD) (amino acids 51–131) of Raf1 (31de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 32Tanowitz M. Si J. Yu D.H. Feng G.S. Mei L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9426-9435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, serum-starved HEK 293 cells were treated with neuregulin (10 nm) for 10 min and lysed in Ras-binding buffer (15% glycerol, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). Cleared lysates were incubated for 1 h with recombinant GST-RBD (15 μg/sample) that had been precoupled to glutathione-agarose beads. After four washes in the Ras-binding buffer, bead complexes were separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for Western blotting. Ras was detected using the rat monoclonal antibody Y13-259 followed by horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rat antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted by TRIzol (Invitrogen) and first-strand cDNA prepared using the SuperScript III First-strand Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. PCR parameters were 25 cycles (94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s) followed by a final extension cycle at 72 °C for 7 min. PCR product was resolved on 6% acrylamide gels and visualized by ethidium bromide. Primers were as follows: 5′-TGA TGC TGA AAG TGG CCC ACC AGC C-3′ and 5′-TGA AGA AAC TTC TCG TAC AAT GAT G-3′ for Erbin; 5′-CCA TGT CCC CGC GGC TGC GC-3′ and 5′-GAG CCC ACG CTG AAG AGC AC-3′ for the AChR ϵ-subunit; and 5′-GCT CGT CGTCGA CAA CGG CTC-3′ and 5′-CAAACATGATCT GGG TCA TCT TCT C-3′ for β-actin.Inhibition of Erbin Expression by Small Hairpin RNA (shRNA)—shRNA virus was generated by the BLOCK-iT Lentiviral RNAi Expression System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, analysis of the Erbin sequence by a program provided by Invitrogen, three sequences were picked and cloned into the pENTR/U6 entry construct to yield pENTR/U6-Erbin. They were transfected in HEK 293 cells for their ability to suppress endogenous Erbin expression assayed by Western blot. Two clones, 2583 and 4049, were found effective in suppressing Erbin expression and were used for viral production. 2583 encodes 5′-CAC CGC TGA TGA CAC TCA CAA ATT ACG AAT AAT TTG TGA GTG TCA TCA GC-3′, whereas 4049 encodes 5′-CAC CGC ATC CCT CTA GAG AAC AAC TCG AAA GTT GTT CTC TAG AGG GAT GC-3′. pLenti6-Erbin was generated by left-right recombination between the pENTR/U6 entry construct and pLenti6/BLOCK-iT-DEST. 293FT producer cells were cotransfected with pLenti6-Erbin and a packaging mix to produce lentivirus.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONErbin Inhibits Activation of Raf but Not Ras—In an earlier report, we showed that Erbin inhibits ERK activation (27Huang Y.Z. Zang M. Xiong W.C. Luo Z. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1108-1114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The site of action was mapped to be between Raf and Ras using phospho-ERK as the readout, because Erbin inhibits ERK activation by active Ras but not by active Raf. Raf is a serine-threonine kinase that phosphorylates and activates the dual specificity kinase, MEK (MAPKK) (33Luo Z. Tzivion G. Belshaw P.J. Vavvas D. Marshall M. Avruch J. Nature. 1996; 383: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) which, in turn, phosphorylates and activates ERK. Although these observations suggest that Erbin may inhibit Raf activation, it is possible that Ras activation may also be a target of regulation. To address these questions, we studied the effects of Erbin on Ras and Raf activation in HEK 293 cells. Tagged Ras and Raf were cotransfected with Erbin or LRR. After stimulation with neuregulin, active Ras was purified by the Ras-binding domain of Raf immobilized on beads. The RBD binds to active Ras with an affinity 3 orders of magnitude higher than inactive GDP-bound Ras and has been used widely to purify active Ras (31de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 32Tanowitz M. Si J. Yu D.H. Feng G.S. Mei L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9426-9435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Purified active Ras was revealed by immunoblotting with anti-Ras antibody. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, active Ras was increased by neuregulin. However, the increase was not altered by Erbin or LRR, suggesting that Erbin may have little effect on Ras activation.In light of the inability of Erbin to inhibit Ras activation and active Raf-mediated ERK activation, we determined whether Erbin inhibits Raf activation. FLAG-Raf1 was cotransfected with Myc-Erbin or LRR in HEK 293 cells. FLAG-Raf1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody and blotted by anti-phospho-Raf antibody. Neuregulin elicited Raf1 activation in control HEK 293 cells (4 ± 0.2-fold above basal, mean ± S.E., n = 3) (Fig. 1, C and D). In cells co-expressing Erbin and LRR, Raf1 activation was inhibited by 40 and 45% (2.4 ± 0.2 and 2.2 ± 0.2, respectively; mean ± S.E., n = 3). These observations indicate that Erbin inhibits Raf activation but has no apparent effect on Ras activation.The LRR Domain Is Necessary and Sufficient to Inhibit ϵ416-Luc Expression—Erbin has three domains: the N-terminal LRR domain, an LAP-specific domain that is C-terminal to the LRR, and the C-terminal PDZ domain (13Saito H. Santoni M.J. Arsanto J.P. Jaulin-Bastard F. Le Bivic A. Marchetto S. Audebert S. Isnardon D. Adelaide J. Birnbaum D. Borg J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32051-32055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The LRR domain has been shown to be sufficient to inhibit ERK activation (27Huang Y.Z. Zang M. Xiong W.C. Luo Z. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1108-1114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To exclude the possible involvement of other domains, it was important to determine whether the LRR domain is required for the inhibitory effect. To this end, we characterized the effects of ΔLRR, a deletion mutant without the LRR domain, on neuregulin-induced expression of ϵ416-Luc (Fig. 2B). ϵ416-Luc is a reporter transgene containing a 416-bp 5′-flanking region of the AChR ϵ-subunit gene and the luciferase gene, which responds to neuregulin stimulation in skeletal muscle cells (30Si J. Luo Z. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19752-19759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 32Tanowitz M. Si J. Yu D.H. Feng G.S. Mei L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9426-9435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Si J. Mei L. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Expression of constitutively active Ras (V12), Raf (BXB), or Mek1 (ddMek1) increased the promoter activity of ϵ416-Luc. Expression of constitutively active Ras and Raf increases expression of theϵ416 transgenes (30Si J. Luo Z. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19752-19759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, co-expression of Erbin suppressed RasV12-induced activation of ϵ416-Luc. In contrast, however, Erbin appeared to be unable to inhibit RafBXB- or ddMek1-induced ϵ416-Luc expression. These results confirm our early report that Erbin may function downstream or at the level of Ras and, at the same time, validate the reporter for a reliable readout. Erbin, LRR, or ΔLRR was cotransfected with ϵ416-Luc in C2C12 myoblasts, and the resulting myotubes were stimulated with neuregulin and assayed for luciferase activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Although Erbin and LRR attenuated neuregulin-induced expression of ϵ416-Luc, the deletion of LRR (ΔLRR) prevented Erbin from inhibiting neuregulin-induced expression. These results suggest that the LRR domain is necessary and sufficient for inhibition of ϵ416-Luc expression.FIGURE 2The LRR domain is required for Erbin inhibition of neuregulin induction of ϵ416-Luc. A, Erbin inhibition of ϵ416-Luc expression by active Ras but not active Raf or MEK1. C2C12 myoblasts were transfected with ϵ416-Luc with various amounts of expression constructs of active Ras, Raf, or MEK1. A Renilla luciferase plasmid, pRL-TK, was cotransfected as a control to monitor the transfection efficiency and sample handling. After differentiation, cells were lysed, and firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were assayed. Cells transfected with an empty vector were taken as 100%. Shown is a representative experiment in duplicates, which was repeated three times with similar results. B, the LRR domain is necessary and sufficient to inhibit neuregulin-induced ϵ416-Luc expression. C2C12 cells were transfected with ϵ416-Luc, pRL-TK, and the indicated Erbin constructs (structures are shown below the histogram). Luciferase activities were assayed as in A. *, p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Erbin Interaction with Sur-8—Sur-8 is believed to be a positive regulator of the Ras-Raf-MEK pathway, functioning as a scaffold that enhances ERK activation by facilitating the interaction between Ras and Raf (33Luo Z. Tzivion G. Belshaw P.J. Vavvas D. Marshall M. Avruch J. Nature. 1996; 383: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 36Li W. Han M. Guan K.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 895-900PubMed Google Scholar). Sur-8 is composed almost entirely of 18 LRRs that show homology to the LRR domain of Erbin. Interestingly, like Erbin, Sur-8 interacts with active RasV12 but not with inactive RasN17 (36Li W. Han M. Guan K.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 895-900PubMed Google Scholar). We reasoned that Erbin may interact with Sur-8 and thus disrupt its interaction with Ras to inhibit ERK activation. First we tested whether Erbin and Sur-8 interact in cells. GST-Sur-8 and Myc-Erbin were cotransfected into HEK 293 cells. Cell lysates were incubated with glutathione-conjugated agarose beads to pull down Sur-8, and the resulting precipitates were blotted with anti-Myc antibody. As shown in the top panels of Fig. 3A, Myc-Erbin was detected in the precipitates of GST-Sur-8. In a reciprocal experiment, GST-Sur-8 was present in immunoprecipitates of Myc-Erbin (Fig. 3A, bottom panels). These results suggest that Erbin interacts with Sur-8 in cells. Further analyses showed that Erbin interaction with Sur-8 requires the LRR domain. Deletion of this domain prevented Erbin from interacting with Sur-8 (Fig. 3B). To determine whether the interaction occurs between the two proteins at endogenous levels, HEK 293 cell lysates were incubated with anti-Sur-8 serum, and the resulting precipitates were probed with anti-Erbin antibodies (Fig. 3C). Erbin was detected in Sur-8 precipitates, suggesting that endogenous Erbin and Sur-8 may interact in cells.FIGURE 3Interaction between Erbin and Sur-8. A, co-immunoprecipitation of Sur-8 and Erbin. COS-7 cells were transfected with mammalian expression constructs of GST-Sur-8 or/and Myc-Erbin. Top panels, cell lysates were incubated with glutathione-conjugated beads to purify GST-Sur-8. The resulting complex was probed with anti-Myc antibody. Lysates were also blotted with anti-GST or anti-Myc antibodies to show expression of transfected proteins. Bottom panels, cell lysates were incubated with anti-Myc antibody and subsequently protein G beads to precipitate Myc-Erbin. The complex was probed with anti-GST antibody. The presence of transfected proteins in lysates was revealed by immunoblotting (IB) with indicated antibodies. IP, immunoprecipitate. PD, pull down. B, the LRR domain in Erbin is necessary and sufficient to interact with Sur-8. COS-7 cells were transfected with mammalian expression constructs of GST-Sur-8 together with Myc-Erbin, Myc-LRR, or Myc-ΔLRR. Cell lysates were incubated with glutathione-conjugated beads to purify GST-Sur-8, and the resulting complex was probed with anti-Myc antibody. Expression of GST-Sur-8 was shown in the lower panel. C, interaction of endogenous Erbin and Sur-8. COS-7 lysates were incubated with anti-Sur-8 antibody or control serum and subsequently with protein A beads to precipitate Sur-8. The resulting complex was probed with anti-Erbin antibody (upper panel) or anti-Sur-8 antibody (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Disruption of the Sur-8-Ras and -Raf Interaction by Erbin—To determine whether Erbin regulates the Sur-8-Ras interaction, HEK 293 cells were transfected with GST-Sur-8, FLAG-RasV12, and Myc-Erbin. Cell lysates were incubated with glutathione-conjugated agarose beads to pull down Sur-8, and the resulting precipitates were blotted for RasV12 with anti-FLAG antibody. Sur-8 and RasV12 co-precipitated (Fig. 4A), in agreement with earlier studies (36Li W. Han M. Guan K.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 895-900PubMed Google Scholar). However, co-expression blocked the interaction of Sur-8 with RasV12. This effect was dose-dependent (Fig. 4B). The amount of RasV12 interacting with Sur-8 decreased as the concentration of Erbin increased. These results demonstrated that Erbin may be able to disrupt the Sur-8-Ras complex. In addition, Erbin expression appeared to inhibit the interaction between Sur-8 and Raf (Fig. 4C). These observations are in agreement with the notion that Erbin inhibits ERK activation by disrupting Sur-8 interaction with Ras and Raf.FIGURE 4Disruption of the Sur-8-Ras interaction by Erbin. A and B, HEK 293 cells were transfected with mammalian expression constructs of FLAG-Ras (V12) and GST-Sur-8 without or with Myc-Erbin at a single concentration (A) or at various concentrations (B). GST-Sur-8 was purified as described for Fig. 3, and the resulting complex was probed with anti-Ras antibody. Expression of transfected proteins was revealed by immunoblotting (IB) with the indicated antibodies. C, disruption of the Sur-8-Raf interaction by Erbin.

RNA interference has been shown recently to specifically suppress the expression of endogenous and heterologous genes in mammalian cell lines (37Dillin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Fumonisin B1, a dihydroceramide synthase inhibitor, exaggerated the CLN9-deficient phenotype of accelerated growth, decreased ceramide and increased apoptosis. This was neutralized by 4-HPR.

Mutations in all known NCL genes, including CLN3, were ruled out in the CLN9-deficient variant. CLN9-deficient patient fibroblasts have a distinctive phenotype. They have small and rounded cell bodies, grow rapidly, are sensitive to apoptosis and manifest a cell adhesion defect. Their gene expression pattern is significantly different from that in other NCL forms. Genes involved in cell cycle, cell adhesion, and apoptosis are significantly dysregulated (15Schulz A. Dhar S. Rylova S. Dbaibo G. Alroy J. Hagel C. Artacho I. Kohlschütter A. Lin S. Boustany R.M. Ann. Neurol. 2004; 56: 341-350Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Sphingolipid metabolism, similarly to other NCL variants, is also perturbed in CLN9-deficient cells; ceramide, sphingomyelin (SM), lactosylceramide, gangliosides, ceramide trihexoside, and globoside, galactosylceramide, and glucosylceramide are diminished. The purpose of this study is to dissect out the specific biochemical defect in CLN9-deficient cells, with the ultimate goal of identifying the CLN9 gene and protein. Low levels of lactosylceramide and its metabolites including gangliosides, ceramide trihexoside, and globoside can implicate the seven genes for β-1,4-galactosyltransferase (β4GalT) and the two for GB3/CD77 synthase as possible candidate genes. Review of the gene chip data provided additional information; acid sphingomyelinase activity was normal, but mRNA expression of acid sphingomyelinase was 22-fold decreased in the setting of low baseline sphingomyelin levels. Defects in sphingomyelin synthase 1 and/or 2 (SMS1, SMS2) could account for this. A trafficking defect of ceramide from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi due to defects in ceramide transporter protein, the ER-to-Golgi ceramide transporter, could also account for low SM (16Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Low ceramide levels also suggest a defect in de novo ceramide synthesis. Activity of serine palmitoyltransferase, the key enzyme of de novo ceramide synthesis, was 4-fold increased, expanding the list of candidate genes to those involved in de novo ceramide synthesis beyond the serine palmitoyltransferase step. Transfection with CLN8 corrected the CLN9 phenotype. The CLN8 protein contains a Lag1 motif similar to other TRAM-Lag1-CLN8 proteins (17Winter E. Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 381-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Lag1p and Lac1p are homologous, multispanning transmembrane proteins that reside in the ER. Both contain a 52-amino acid-long Lag1 motif that is necessary for ceramide synthesis in yeast (18Guillas I. Kirchman P.A. Chuard R. Pfefferli M. Jiang J.C. Jazwinski S.M. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2655-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 19Schorling S. Vallee B. Barz W.P. Riezmann H. Oesterhelt D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3417-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Lac1p, Lag1p, and Lip1p are components of the enzyme activity in yeast (20Vallee B. Riezmann H. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 730-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). CLN8 sequencing results were normal in CLN9-deficient cells, suggesting human Lag1 homologs or activators of their proteins could be candidate genes for CLN9. Cell Lines—CLN9-deficient fibroblast lines were derived from skin biopsies of two CLN9 patients. Use of human cell lines in research is covered by an approved Duke institutional review board protocol. Tissue Culture Studies—Fibroblasts were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 1% antibiotics/antimycotics. Growth Curves—1 × 105 cells/well were plated in 6-well plates, then harvested and counted at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h in triplicate for each time point using the trypan blue dye exclusion method. Trypan Blue Dye Exclusion—Harvested cells were centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 min, and pellets were suspended in a 1:1 mixture of 4% trypan blue dye (Invitrogen) and 1× phosphate-buffered saline and loaded onto a hemocytometer. Viable white and dead blue cells were counted. Etoposide Treatment—Cells were treated with 10 μg/ml etoposide (Sigma) for 18 h. Apoptosis was determined by propidium iodide (PI), JC-1, or terminal dUTP nick-end labeling staining. 4-HPR Treatment—Cells were treated with 2.5, 5, and 10 μm 4-HPR (Sciencelab.com, Houston, TX). 4-HPR was dissolved in ethanol at a concentration of 10 mm and stored at -20 °C. Stock solutions were diluted to the required concentrations with growth medium just before use. Fumonisin B1 Treatment—Cells were treated with 1 μm fumonisin B1 (FB1) (Sigma). FB1 was dissolved in Me2SO at a concentration of 1 mm and stored at -20°C. Stock solutions were diluted to the required concentration with growth medium just before use. PDMP Treatment—Cells were treated with 20 μm PDMP (Sigma). PDMP was dissolved in Me2SO at a concentration of 20 mm and stored at -20°C. Stock solutions were diluted to the required concentration with growth medium just before use. Transfection—Cells were transfected with different cDNA-vector constructs: CLN1-pGEM, CLN2-pGEM, CLN3-pGEM, CLN6-pGEM, CLN8-pGEM (cDNAs amplified and cloned as previously described), Lag1-pGEM, LASS1-pIRES2-EGFP (cDNA clones provided by S. M. Jazwinski), LASS1trv3-pGEM, LASS2trv1/2-pGEM, LASS3-pIRES2-EGFP, LASS5-pGEM (cDNA clones purchased from Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL), LASS2trv3-pGEM (cDNA clone purchased from OriGene Technologies Inc, Rockville, MD), LASS4-pBluescript (cDNA clone purchased from RZPD, Berlin, Germany). The protocols for the Lipofectamine 2000 Transfection kit (Invitrogen) were followed. The cells were washed and plated for analysis. Transfection efficiency of pGEM-transfected cells was determined using an YFP-pGEM construct and counting yellow fluorescent cells/total cells/vision field in triplicate under fluorescent microscopy. Transfection efficiency of pIRES2-EGFP-transfected cells was determined by counting green fluorescent cells/total cells/vision field in triplicate under fluorescent microscopy. Transfection efficiency of pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO-transfected cells was determined using a pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO-LacZ construct. Transfected cells were stained using a β-galactosidase staining kit (Invitrogen). Transfection efficiency was determined counting stained cells/total cells/vision field in triplicate under light microscopy. Sequencing—All exons including exon-intron junctions of GB3/CD77 synthase, β4Galt1-7, LASS1, LASS2, and LASS4, were amplified from genomic DNA of CLN9-deficient cells. Entire coding regions of LASS5, LASS6, SMS1, and SMS2 were amplified from cDNA of CLN9-deficient cells. Products were sequenced using an automated sequencer (377XL Prism DNA Sequencer; PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA). PI Staining—Equal numbers of cells treated/not treated with etoposide were grown on coverslips and stained with PI (5 μg/ml) for 5 min. Three fields of vision were chosen randomly at 100× magnification. The total number of cells/field of vision (20-60 cells/field) was counted. The number of PI-positive red apoptotic cells was determined under fluorescence (excitation wavelength, 525 nm; emission wavelength, 600 nm). The percentage of PI-positive cells/total cells/field of vision was calculated. Average and S.D. were determined, and statistical significance was calculated using Student's t test. JC-1 Staining—JC-1 stain (5,50-60-tetrachloro-1,1,3,3-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used to assess the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential after treatment with etoposide. JC-1 is a cationic dye that forms J-aggregates with the cytochrome c-apoptosis protein-activating factor-1 complex. Cells undergoing apoptosis are visualized when a shift in the emission spectrum from green (525 nm) to red (590 nm) occurs. This shift signals the onset of apoptosis. Equal numbers of cells treated/not treated with etoposide were grown on coverslips. The cells were then washed with 1 × phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 1 mg/ml of JC-1 stain for 15 min at 37 °C and in 5% CO2. The cells were again washed in phosphate-buffered saline and the mounted on a slide with 1:1 phosphate-buffered saline: glycerol mix. Red apoptotic and total cells in three different fields of vision were counted (100-200 cells/field). The percentage of red apoptotic cells/total cells/field of vision was calculated as well as average and S.D. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test. Analysis of Exogenous Ceramide Trafficking—Equal numbers (1 × 105) of normal and CLN9-deficient fibroblasts were grown on coverslips and incubated in a solution containing Hanks' balanced salt solution, 10 mm HEPES (Invitrogen), 1% (w/v) fatty acid free bovine serum albumin (Sigma), and 5 μm C6-NBD-ceramide at 16 °C for 3 h. Cells were then washed in HEPES-buffered saline solution followed by back exchange for 30 min in HEPES-buffered saline solution-bovine serum albumin. Cells were mounted onto a glass slide with 1 drop of Fluoromount (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL) and viewed with a Leica DMLB fluorescent microscope. Ceramide and Dihydroceramide Levels—Ceramide and dihydroceramide levels were quantified by mass spectrometry (Lipidomics Core, Medical University of South Carolina) according to published methods. Ceramide and dihydroceramide levels were also measured by DGK assay using diacylglycerol kinase from Escherichia coli (Sigma) and 1.3 μCi of ATP/sample (Amersham Biosciences) using standards for C16, C24, and C24:1 ceramides and the corresponding dihydroceramides (Avanti, Alabaster, AL). Dihydroceramide Synthase Activity—Dihydroceramide synthase activity was determined by measuring de novo dihydroceramide generated per hour after labeling cells with C17-dihydrosphingosine (C6-dihydrosphingosine with C17 backbone) (molecular mass, 287.5 g/mol; 5 μm)for 4 h. Sphingomyelin Synthase Activity—Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested using a rubber policeman, and homogenized in 1 ml of 25 mm KCl and 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) (TK buffer) and 0.5 mm EDTA. Cells were homogenized by 20 passages through a 27-gauge needle. Homogenates were used fresh. SM synthesis was assayed as described. The reaction mixture contained 100 μg of protein, 10 μl of NBD-6-ceramide (1 mm), and 1.7 μl of phosphatidylcholine (10 mg/ml) in a total volume of 300 μl of TK buffer. The reaction was terminated after 90 min at 37 °C by the addition of 1 ml of chloroform, 1 ml of methanol, and 400 μl of water. Lipids were then extracted according to Bligh and Dyer, and SM spots were separated on TLC using chloroform/methanol/CaCl2 (15 mm) solution (120:70:16 v/v/v) as the developing solvent. TLC plates were analyzed using a PhosphorImager, and bands were quantified by ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences Version 2003). Real-time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from normal and CLN9-deficient fibroblasts using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Reverse transcription reactions were carried out with Super Script III first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was performed using total cDNA and Absolute QPCR SYBR Green Fluorescence Mix (Abgene Inc., Rochester, NY) according to the manufacturer's protocol in a Bio-Rad I-Cycler. The mRNA levels of cyclophilin/hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase/28 S ribosomal RNA were used as internal controls. CLN8 Corrects Growth and Apoptosis in CLN9-deficient Cells—CLN9-deficient fibroblasts were transfected with CLN1, CLN2, CLN3, CLN6, and CLN8 genes individually and were assessed for growth and sensitivity to apoptosis. Only transfection with CLN8, out of all NCL genes, partially corrected growth in CLN9-deficient cells (Fig. 1, A and B). CLN9-deficient cells transfected with CLN8 cDNA showed a significant decrease in growth rate compared with CLN9-deficient cells transfected with empty vector. Growth rate still exceeded that of normal fibroblasts transfected with empty vector (EV) (Fig. 1C). Transfection with CLN8 decreased sensitivity to apoptosis in CLN9-deficient fibroblasts. Cells transfected with CLN8 or empty vector were stained with JC-1 after 16 h of etoposide treatment. Cells transfected with CLN8 showed significantly less red J-aggregate formation than controls transfected with empty vector (Fig. 1D). Dihydroceramide Synthase Activity; Dihydroceramide and Ceramide Levels Are Low in CLN9-deficient Cells—CLN9-deficient cells have significantly decreased dihydroceramide synthase activity, as reflected by the decreased levels of dihydroceramide and ceramide in CLN9-deficient cells. The most significant decreases were in dhC16-, dhC24-, and dhC26-ceramide and C16-, C24-, and C24:1-ceramide species compared with control cells (Fig. 2, A and B). DhC24-Cer, dhC24:1-Cer, and dhC26:1-Cer levels were 4.4, 8.2, and 9.5%, respectively, compared with normal controls. Dihydroceramide synthase activity was measured by labeling cells with C17 dihydrosphingosine and measuring dihydroceramide generated over 4 h (see Fig. 5G).FIG. 5—continuedView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Lag1 Sc Increases Ceramide and Corrects Growth and Apoptosis in CLN9-deficient Cells—Transfection with Lag1 Sc increased total ceramide levels in CLN9-deficient cells 105% above levels in cells transfected with empty vector. This was determined by DGK assay (Fig. 3A). Tandem mass spectrometry showed an increase in the long chain ceramide species C18-Cer/C20-Cer/C24:1-Cer/C24-Cer (data not shown). Lag1 Sc decreased growth rate after transfection (Fig. 3B). Lag1 Sc also decreased sensitivity to apoptosis by PI staining after treatment with etoposide. Two CLN9-deficient cell lines had a 32.4 and 29.6% apoptotic rate after transfection with empty vector compared with a 12.8 and 4.1% apoptotic rate after transfection with Lag1 Sc (Fig. 3C). Normal fibroblasts, on the other hand, had increased apoptosis after transfection with Lag1Sc (22.6 versus 40.6%, Fig. 3C). Baseline ceramide levels were higher in normal fibroblasts (Fig. 2B). Lag1 Sc overexpression leads to higher, proapoptotic ceramide levels. In conclusion, yeast Lag1 Sc partially corrected ceramide levels, growth, and apoptosis in CLN9-deficient cells. Human Lag1 Homologs Correct Ceramide, Growth, and Apoptosis in CLN9-deficient Cells—LASS1 is the human homolog to Lag1 Sc. LASS1 increased total ceramide levels more than 4-fold in CLN9-deficient cells, as determined by DGK assay (Fig. 4A). [14C]Palmitate labeling established an increase in de novo ceramide synthesis as well (data not shown). LASS1 increased mass measurements of C18- and C18:1-ceramide species by 100% in normal fibroblasts and 300% in CLN9-deficient fibroblasts after transfection (Fig. 4B). This is consistent with published reports on LASS1 ceramide species specificity. LASS1 partially corrected growth rate in CLN9-deficient cells (Fig. 4C), and decreased cell proliferation as shown by [H3]thymidine incorporation (data not shown). LASS1 decreased CLN9-deficient cell sensitivity to apoptosis as observed by PI staining (Fig. 4D) and JC-1 staining (data not shown). LASS1 sequences were normal in CLN9-deficient cells. Other human Lag1 homologs LASS1-LASS6 (including multiple transcript variants) were tested for their ability to correct the CLN9 phenotype. All except LASS3 partially corrected growth and diminished apoptosis in CLN9-deficient cells (data not shown). LASS1, LASS2, LASS4, LASS5, and LASS6 sequences were normal in CLN9-deficient cells. LASS2 expression levels were normal, and LASS1, -3, -4, and -6 expression levels were increased 12.7-, 6.2-, 9.6-, and 4.3-fold excluding the possibility that the CLN9 gene could be one of the known human Lag1 homologs. 4-HPR Increases Dihydroceramide Synthase Activity and Dihydroceramide Levels, Corrects Growth, and Decreases LASS1 Expression by Reverse Transcription-PCR—CLN9-deficient cells were treated with fenretinide or 4-HPR, a dihydroceramide synthase activator (21Wang H. Maurer B.J. Reynolds C.P. Cabot M.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5102-5105PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment with 4-HPR increased dihydroceramide levels in both normal and CLN9-deficient fibroblasts. Normal fibroblasts showed an increase of all dihydroceramide species except dhC18:1-Cer. CLN9-deficient cells showed an increase in all dihydroceramide species that was significantly higher than the increase in normal cells. dhC16-Cer, dhC24-Cer, and dhC26:1-Cer levels increased the most after 4-HPR treatment and were elevated 244-, 359-, and 320-fold, respectively, in CLN9-deficient cells (Fig. 5 A). The same dihydroceramide species had the lowest levels in untreated CLN9-deficient cells (Fig. 2A). Dihydroceramide synthase activity was also increased by 4-HPR (Fig. 5G). There was, however, no increase in rate of de novo ceramide synthesis after 4-HPR treatment in CLN9-deficient cells as measured by [14C]palmitate labeling. Treatment with 4-HPR decreased levels of all ceramide species as measured by tandem mass spectrometry (Fig. 5B). This effect might be due to a combined action of 4-HPR as activator of dihydroceramide synthase and inhibitor of dihydroceramide desaturase. 3A. Merrill, personal communication. Treatment with 4-HPR corrected growth of CLN9-deficient cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Continuous treatment with 4-HPR at the same concentration showed significant decrease of growth in CLN9-deficient cells after 48 h (Fig. 5C). Treatment with 2.5 μm 4-HPR did not have a significant effect on growth, but 5 and 10 μm 4-HPR decreased growth in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5C). There was no effect of 4-HPR on growth of normal cells when used at the same concentration (data not shown). 4-HPR decreased LASS1 expression to 0.22-fold in mRNA from untreated CLN9-deficient cells. In normal cells 4-HPR decreased LASS1 expression to 0.5-fold expression from normal fibroblasts. 4-HPR or PDMP Protects CLN9-deficient Cells from Apoptosis—Treatment with 4-HPR protected CLN9-deficient cells from apoptosis. Cells treated with 4-HPR showed significantly less apoptosis by PI staining (20.4% untreated versus 5.4% treated with 5 μm 4-HPR). This effect was dose-dependent. 10 μm 4-HPR decreased apoptosis even further (4.1%; Fig. 5D). These results were confirmed by JC-1 and terminal dUTP nick-end labeling staining. 4-HPR normally increases apoptosis (22Maurer B.J. Metelitsa L.S. Seeger R.C. Cabot M.C. Reynolds C.P. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 1138-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). CLN9-deficient cells were protected from apoptosis by 4-HPR. Treating CLN9-deficient cells with PDMP, which inhibits glucosylceramide synthase, results in an increase in ceramide mass measurements (23Abe A. Inokuchi J. Jimbo M. Shimeno H. Nagamatsu A. Shayman J.A. Shukla G.S. Radin N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 111: 191-196Google Scholar). PDMP diminished apoptosis in CLN9-deficient cells. Treatment with PDMP and 4-HPR, however, increased apoptosis above the level of untreated CLN9-deficient cells. This was determined by PI staining (Fig. 5E). This effect may be due to the combined effect of an increase in ceramide due to PDMP and an increase in dihydroceramide due to 4-HPR (Fig. 5F). These drugs act at different steps of the pathway. Fumonisin B1, a Dihydroceramide Synthase Inhibitor, Exaggerates the CLN9 Phenotype—To confirm that the CLN9-phenotype could be due to a defect in activation of dihydroceramide synthase, FB1 was used. It inhibits dihydroceramide synthase and should, therefore, exaggerate the CLN9 phenotype. Pretreatment with FB1 decreased base-line low ceramide levels in CLN9-deficient cells even further. 4-HPR neutralized the effect of FB1 on ceramide levels. Ceramide levels were measured by DGK assay after 34 h of 4-HPR treatment (Fig. 6A). FB1 treatment accelerated growth of CLN9-deficient cells, exaggerating the CLN9 phenotype. Treatment with 4-HPR opposed this increase in growth (Fig. 6B). CLN9-deficient cells pretreated with FB1 also had a higher apoptotic rate than untreated cells. FB1 opposed the protective effect of 4-HPR. The effects on apoptosis were amplified in the presence of etoposide as visualized by PI staining and confirmed by JC-1 staining (Fig. 6C). Low Sphingomyelin in CLN9-deficient Cells Is Not Due to a Ceramide Trafficking Defect—Ceramide produced at the ER is transported via ceramide transporter protein or ceramide transporter protein to the lumen of the Golgi for conversion to SM by sphingomyelin synthase 1 (16Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Should a ceramide trafficking defect be present, sphingomyelin synthase activity would be elevated. Sphingomyelin synthase activity was 40% of normal, negating the possibility of a ceramide trafficking defect in CLN9-deficient cells. Also, CLN9-deficient cells, when exposed to fluorescent NBD-C6-ceramide, demonstrated an intensely fluorescent Golgi reflecting normal trafficking and uptake of ceramide with conversion to SM in the Golgi lumen (Fig. 7). The CLN9 phenotype is best explained by the extremely low dihydroceramide and ceramide levels. Increasing dihydroceramide by 4-HPR or ceramide by PDMP corrected the phenotype. CLN9-deficient cells manifest increased apoptosis but accelerated growth combined with very low ceramide levels (15Schulz A. Dhar S. Rylova S. Dbaibo G. Alroy J. Hagel C. Artacho I. Kohlschütter A. Lin S. Boustany R.M. Ann. Neurol. 2004; 56: 341-350Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The marked decrease in de novo lactosylceramide synthesis and glycosphingolipids and gangliosides derived from it begged the question of whether one of the seven β-1,4-galactosyltransferases (β4GalT1-7) or GB3/CD77 synthase could be candidates for CLN9. All seven β4GalT proteins are membrane proteins that reside in the Golgi, and the latter is also the seat of SM synthesis from ceramide and lactosylceramide synthesis from glucosylceramide (24Amado M. Almeida R. Schwientek T. Clausen H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 35-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 25Hennet T. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1081-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). A defect in β4GalT7 had already been described in a patient with a progeroid, Ehlers-Danlos-like syndrome (26Kresse H. Rosthoj S. Quentin E. Hollmann J. Glossl J. Okada S. Tonnesen T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1987; 41: 436-453PubMed Google Scholar). We ruled out mutations in these genes in CLN9 patients by sequence analysis. Low sphingomyelin suggested a possible defect in sphingomyelin synthesis. SM synthase proteins SMS1 and SMS2 reside in the Golgi and the plasma membrane, respectively (27Huitema K. van den Dikkenberg J. Brouwers J.F.H.M. Hlothuis J.C.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 28Yamaoka S. Miyaji M. Kitano T. Umehara H. Okazaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 18: 18688-18693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Sphingomyelin synthase activities were 40% of normal, and sequences of both of SMS1 and SMS2 were intact in CLN9-deficient cells. Also, SMS1 and SMS2 gene expression in CLN9-deficient cells was comparable with normal. Moreover, overexpression of SMS1 or SMS2 in CLN9-deficient cells had no effect on growth, essentially ruling them out as candidate genes for CLN9. Transfection with CLN8 corrected growth and decreased apoptosis in CLN9-deficient cells. Human dihydroceramide synthase is still poorly characterized. Overexpression of the yeast gene Lag1 Sc and LASS1, the human Lag1 homolog for Lag1 Sc, complemented the defect in CLN9 cells with correction of ceramide levels, growth, and apoptosis. The inhibiting effect of ceramide on cell growth is well known. The mouse homologue of Lag1 increases C18-ceramide and decreases cell growth in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells derived from head and neck tumors (29Koybasi S. Senkal C.E. Sundararaj K. Spassieva S. Bielawski J. Osta W. Day T.A. Jiang J.C. Jazwinski S.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Ogretmen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44311-44319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). LASS1 Hs is primarily expressed in brain, with very low levels of expression in skeletal muscle and testis. Genes involved in neurodegenerative diseases have a distribution pattern similar to that of human LASS1 or LASS1 Hs (30Jiang J.C. Kirchman P.A. Zagulski M. Hunt J. Jazwinski S.M. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 1259-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Analysis of tissue distribution of mouse LASS1, LASS2, LASS4, LASS5, and LASS6 confirmed that only LASS1 expression was mostly brain-specific (31Mizutani Y. Kihara A. Igarashi Y. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). A normal LASS1 sequence as well as elevated levels of gene expression in CLN9-deficient cells excludes LASS1 from being a candidate for CLN9. All other human Lag1 homologs except LASS3 could partially correct growth and apoptosis in CLN9-deficient cells. LASS3 contains both a Lag1 motif and a Hox domain. Studies in yeast cells led to the hypothesis that both motifs are important for ceramide synthesis (32Venkataraman K. Futerman A.H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 528: 3-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that in mammalian cells this is not necessarily true. Transfection with either LASS1, LASS2 transcript variant 1 or 2, or LASS2 transcript variant 3 corrected growth and apoptosis in CLN9-deficient cells. LASS2 transcript variants 1 and 2 contain both a Lag1 motif and a Hox domain. LASS2 transcript variant 3 lacks the Hox domain but was still able to complement CLN9. Only the Lag1 motif and not the Hox domain is sufficient and necessary for ceramide synthesis in human fibroblasts. Low dihydroceramide levels and low de novo dihydroceramide synthesis and increases in LASS1, LASS3, LASS4, and LASS6 expression by reverse transcription-PCR suggest that CLN9 may be a modulator of dihydroceramide synthase at the protein level. 4-HPR, an activator of dihydroceramide synthase, increased dihydroceramide levels in CLN9-deficient cells. Dihydroceramide levels were markedly increased in both CLN9-deficient and normal fibroblasts by the drug. 4-HPR increased de novo dihydroceramide synthesis but did not increase de novo synthesis or mass levels of ceramide. This was not surprising as 4-HPR also inhibits dihydroceramide desaturase.3 Increases in dihydroceramide levels in CLN9-deficient cells corrected growth and decreased apoptosis. Dihydroceramide has been found to be biologically inactive in some cell systems (33Lee J.Y. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13169-13174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The data from CLN9-deficient cells presented here suggest that dihydroceramide may be biologically active when ceramide levels are extremely low, resulting in modulation of growth and apoptosis. 4-HPR is used as a ceramide-modulating chemotherapeutic agent. A dose- and time-dependent increase in ceramide after 4-HPR treatment has been described in neuroblastoma cell lines, prostate and breast cancer cells, lymphoblastic leukemia cells, and Ewing family tumors as well (34Garaventa A.

Our data also suggest that 4-HPR has different biologic effects depending on base-line ceramide and dihydroceramide levels of the specific cell type; there is protection from apoptosis in CLN9-deficient cells and an increase in apoptosis in normal fibroblasts. We hypothesize that base-line dihydroceramide and ceramide levels in cells determine the effect of 4-HPR on apoptosis. Dihydroceramide levels in CLN9-deficient cells are increased by treatment with 4-HPR, but ceramide levels are lowered even further. PDMP increases ceramide but not dihydroceramide levels. Each of the treatments alone results in protection from apoptosis. Treatment with both 4-HPR and PDMP increased apoptosis in CLN9-deficient cells. This is most likely due to a simultaneous increase of dihydroceramide and ceramide levels. 4-HPR can cause both apoptosis and p53- and caspase-independent cell loss without increases in ceramide (22Maurer B.J. Metelitsa L.S. Seeger R.C. Cabot M.C. Reynolds C.P. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 1138-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Lovat et al. (13Lovat P.E. Di Sano F. Corazzari M. Fazi B.

Treatment with both 4-HPR and desipramine, an inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase, did not change the protective effect of 4-HPR on apoptosis in CLN9-deficient fibroblasts (data not shown). There are two paradoxes here; 4-HPR protects CLN9-deficient cells from apoptosis, and this occurs in the setting of an increase in dihydroceramide and a further decrease in ceramide levels. PDMP, which increases ceramide levels but has no effect on dihydroceramide levels, also protects these cells from apoptosis. This can be explained in multiple ways; 1) a threshold lower level of ceramide is necessary for the well-being of cells, below which apoptosis is activated, 2) when ceramide levels are very low, dihydroceramide assumes some of the biologic functions of ceramide, and the sum total of ceramide and dihydroceramide determines biologic function, or 3) variations in levels of another biologically active sphingolipid metabolite(s) can explain these findings. The findings of low dihydroceramide levels and partial correction of the CLN9-deficient phenotype by human LAG1 homologs, except LASS3, suggested that CLN9 could be a human Lag1 homolog or a regulator of dihydroceramide synthase (Fig. 8). Normal Lag1 homolog sequences, elevated levels of expression of human LASS genes by reverse transcription-PCR, increases in dihydroceramide levels, and a drop in LASS1 expression in response to 4-HPR, however, indicate that CLN9 could be an activator of dihydroceramide synthase should the mutation in CLN9 result in loss of function. Likewise, a gain of mutation function such as in a duplication of a gene or a CLN9 mutation resulting in tighter binding of the inhibitor to dihydroceramide synthase may suggest that CLN9 or mutated CLN9 could be an inhibitor of dihydroceramide synthase activity at the protein level. This work also has diagnostic and therapeutic implications; determination of dihydroceramide levels by tandem mass spectrometry can be developed as a diagnostic test for ascertainment of new CLN9-deficient cases. Moreover, the oral drug 4-HPR, a dihydroceramide synthase activator, may also have potential as a treatment option for CLN9-deficient patients. We thank the affected families for participating in this study."

Here, we analyzed sensory organs and found abnormalities of the olfactory epithelium in adult HSF1-null mice, which is developmentally related to the lens. The olfactory epithelium was normal until postnatal 3 weeks but was not maintained later than 4 weeks in HSF1-null mice. The olfactory epithelium was atrophied with increased cell death of olfactory sensory neurons. Analysis of the epithelium revealed that induction of HSP expression and reduction of LIF expression are lacking in adult HSF1-null mice. We found that DNA binding activity of HSF1 is induced in the olfactory epithelium later than 4 weeks and that HSF1 binds directly to Lif gene and inhibits its expression. HSF4 has opposing effects on LIF expression and olfactory neurogenesis. These data indicate that HSF1 is required for the precise expression of Hsp and cytokine genes that is obligatory for maintenance of olfactory neurogenesis in adult mice and suggest that stress-related processes are involved in its maintenance.

Heat shock response is characterized by induction of a set of heat shock proteins (HSPs) 2The abbreviations used are: HSP, heat shock protein; HSF, heat shock transcription factor; HSE, heat shock element; BrdUrd, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; IL, interleukin; HE, hematoxylin-eosin; TUNEL, terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling. and is an evolutionary conserved response inherent in all organisms from bacteria to human. In eukaryotes, this response is regulated mainly by heat shock transcription factor (HSF), which can bind to a heat shock element (HSE) composed of at least three inverted repeats of consensus sequence nGAAn (1Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref Scopus (982) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, three mammalian Hsf genes (Hsf1, Hsf2, and Hsf4) and three avian HSF genes (HSF1, HSF2, and HSF3) have been identified (2Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar, 3Nakai A. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1999; 4: 86-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and their expression profiles are temporally and spatially different during development (3Nakai A.

In unstressed cells HSF1 is present mostly as a monomer and is converted to a trimer that binds to HSE in response to heat shock, whereas HSF4 is constitutively a trimer. A single mutation of Hsf1, Hsf2, or Hsf4 genes or combined mutations of Hsf genes in mice showed that HSFs are involved in development of the reproductive organs (5Christians E. Davis A.A.

In addition to regulating HSP expression, HSFs are involved in development partly by regulating expression of growth factor genes such as Fgf and Il-6 genes directly (13Fujimoto M. Izu H. Seki K.

Although HSF1 binds to many genes in vivo in unstressed cells (17Trinklein N.D. Murray J.I. Hartman S.J. Botstein D. Myers R.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1254-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), we have little information about when and how HSF activity is regulated during development and maintenance of tissues. We previously identified that HSF4 is required for development of lens in the eye partly by regulating Hsp and Fgf genes (13Fujimoto M. Izu H. Seki K. Fukuda K. Nishida T. Yamada S. Kato K. Yonemura S. Inouye S. Nakai A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4297-4306Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). HSF1 is also involved in lens development and competes with HSF4 for expression of the same Fgf genes. These observations highlighted sensory organs that receive stimuli from the external environment and are susceptible to stress. Here, we examined development of other sensory organs in HSF1- and HSF4-null mice. Surprisingly, we found abnormalities in the nasal cavity in adult HSF1-null mice that are derived from placodes expressing Pax6 gene as well as the lens (18Grindley J.C. Davidson D.R. Hill R.E. Development. 1995; 121: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Quinn J.C. West J.D. Hill R.E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 20Xu P.X. Woo I. Her H.

Mice—HSF1-null (21Inouye S. Katsuki K. Izu H. Fujimoto M. Sugahara K. Yamada S. Shinkai Y. Oka Y. Katoh Y. Nakai A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 5882-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and HSF4-null (13Fujimoto M. Izu H. Seki K. Fukuda K. Nishida T. Yamada S. Kato K. Yonemura S. Inouye S. Nakai A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4297-4306Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) mice were maintained by crossing with ICR mice. Mice deficient for both HSF1 and HSF4 were generated as described previously (13Fujimoto M. Izu H. Seki K. Fukuda K. Nishida T. Yamada S. Kato K. Yonemura S. Inouye S. Nakai A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4297-4306Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Histopathology and Immunohistochemistry—Mice were systematically anesthetized with ketamine (16 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) and xylazine (16 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Blocks of bone containing paranasal sinuses were removed, soaked in 4% paraformaldehyde for 12 h at 4 °C, and then incubated for 10 days in a decalcification solution (5% EDTA, 0.2 m sucrose (pH 7.2)), changing the solution every day. After washing with PBS, the blocks were dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and cut into sections 5-μm thick. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. To detect calcified bone in the nasal cavity, the Tripp-Mackay method for calcium (22Tripp E.J. MacKay E.H. Stain Technol. 1972; 47: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) was used. Bone mass was estimated using NIH images. Immunostaining of the paraffin sections was performed as described previously (6Nakai A. Suzuki M. Tanabe M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1545-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Antibodies used were antisera for mouse HSP110 (αHSP110a) (13Fujimoto M. Izu H. Seki K. Fukuda K. Nishida T. Yamada S. Kato K. Yonemura S. Inouye S. Nakai A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4297-4306Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), for human HSP90 (αHSP90c) (23Katsuki K. Fujimoto M. Zhang X.Y. Izu H. Takaki E. Tanizawa Y. Inouye S. Nakai A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 571: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), for human HSP70 (αHSP70–1) (13Fujimoto M. Izu H. Seki K. Fukuda K. Nishida T. Yamada S. Kato K. Yonemura S. Inouye S. Nakai A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4297-4306Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), for HSP60 (αmHSP60–1) (13Fujimoto M. Izu H. Seki K. Fukuda K. Nishida T. Yamada S. Kato K. Yonemura S. Inouye S. Nakai A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4297-4306Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), for human HSP40 (αhHSP40a, which was generated by immunizing rabbit with recombinant human HSP40), and for rat HSP27 (a gift from Drs. K. Kato and H. Itoh, Aichi Human Service Center). Peroxidase-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG was used as a second antibody. Signals were detected using a DAB substrate kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). Sections were counterstained with methyl green. BrdUrd Incorporation and TUNEL Staining—To examine the patterns of DNA replication, incorporation of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) was analyzed essentially as described previously (13Fujimoto M. Izu H. Seki K. Fukuda K. Nishida T. Yamada S. Kato K. Yonemura S. Inouye S. Nakai A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4297-4306Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). 3–6 week-old mice were injected intraperitoneally with 50 μg/g of BrdUrd (Sigma) diluted with PBS. 16 h after the injection, mice were anesthetized and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS. Blocks of bone containing paranasal sinuses were dissected, fixed, and embedded in paraffin as above. Immunostaining of BrdUrd was performed essentially as described (13Fujimoto M. Izu H. Seki K. Fukuda K. Nishida T. Yamada S. Kato K. Yonemura S. Inouye S. Nakai A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4297-4306Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Numbers of BrdUrd-positive cells were counted in all areas of the olfactory epithelium, and means and S.D. of the numbers in a microscopic field were estimated. To detect apoptotic cells, paraffin sections prepared above were subjected to terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining using an in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Diagnostics). The sections were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Laboratories) and visualized using fluorescence microscopy (Axiophot; Zeiss). Numbers of TUNEL-positive cells were counted in all areas of olfactory epithelium, and means and S.D. of percentages of TUNEL-positive cells were estimated. Western Blot Analysis and Gel Shift Assay—Mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and skulls were immediately medisected using a razor. The olfactory epithelium including turbinates was collected by scraping paranasal sinuses and frozen at -80 °C until use. Whole cell extract from the olfactory epithelium was prepared in buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml of pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml of leupeptin, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) as previously described (24Nakai A. Kawazoe Y. Tanabe M. Nagata K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 5168-5178Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts from the brain, trachea, and oviduct were prepared by dissecting organs from the same mice. Aliquots containing equal amounts of proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis using antiserum for mouse HSF1 (αmHSF1g) (13Fujimoto M. Izu H. Seki K. Fukuda K. Nishida T. Yamada S. Kato K. Yonemura S. Inouye S. Nakai A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4297-4306Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and the antibodies described above. To detect HSE binding activity in the tissues, aliquots containing 80 μg of proteins were subjected to gel shift assay using an ideal HSE oligonucleotide as a probe in the presence or absence of antiserum for each HSF, α-HSF1γ, α-HSF2δ, or α-HSF4b (25Nakai A.

Kato K. Yonemura S. Inouye S. Nakai A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4297-4306Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). RT-PCR Analysis—Olfactory epithelium including turbinates was collected as described above. Total RNA was immediately isolated by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNAs were synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA using a cloned AMV first-strand cDNA synthesis kit that contains avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase, oligo(dT) 20, and a random hexamer (Invitrogen). 25–35 cycles of PCR reactions were performed using 1 μl from each reverse transcription product. Primers used were indicated previously for amplifying Fgf-1, Fgf-7, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and S16 ribosomal protein genes (13Fujimoto M. Izu H. Seki K. Fukuda K. Nishida T. Yamada S. Kato K.

Dev. 2002; 113: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), Bmp (28Johansson B.M. Wiles M.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), and Lif, Tgf, Bdnf, and Omp genes (29Bauer S. Rasika S. Han J. Mauduit C. Raccurt M. Morel G. Jourdan F. Benahmed M. Moyse E. Patterson P.H. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1792-1803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amplified DNA was stained with ethidium bromide and photographed using an Epi-Light UV FA1100 (Aisin Cosmos R&D Co.). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Mice were systematically anesthetized as described above and then transcardially perfused with 1% formaldehyde in PBS. Blocks of bone containing paranasal sinuses were removed and soaked in 1% formaldehyde in PBS at 37 °C for 10 min. Olfactory epithelia including turbinates were collected by scraping the nasal epithelium. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed using a ChIP assay kit (Upstate Group, Inc.) essentially according to the manufacturer’s instructions (13Fujimoto M. Izu H. Seki K. Fukuda K. Nishida T. Yamada S. Kato K. Yonemura S. Inouye S. Nakai A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4297-4306Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Thirty-five cycles of PCR reactions were performed to amplify a DNA fragment of Lif gene (-641 to -270 from a transcription start site). Primers used to amplify ChIP-enriched DNA were: LIF-5′, 5′-CAG CAA GCC CCT TTG TGT CTT CTC TT-3′; LIF-3′,5′-TCC TAA GTG GTT TGC TCT GGG CGT-3′. To amplify an HSE-R3 region (-474 to -270), we used primers HSE-R3–5′,5′-AGC CTG ACT CCT TTT GCT-3′ and HSE-R3–3′,5′-TCC TAA GTG GTT TGC TCT GGG CGT-3′. Transmission Electron Microscopy—Mice were systematically anesthetized and transcardially perfused with a fixative (2% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer at pH 7.4). Blocks of bone containing paranasal sinuses and trachea were removed and soaked in the fixative for 16 h. Samples were then incubated for 10 days in a decalcification solution, changing the solution every day. Transmission electron microscopy was performed as described previously (13Fujimoto M. Izu H. Seki K. Fukuda K. Nishida T. Yamada S. Kato K. Yonemura S. Inouye S. Nakai A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4297-4306Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Olfactory Behavior—Olfactory behavior was estimated in a dark soundproof chamber with a ventilation system. Cotton balls were placed at four corners in a cage, and acetic acid solution (40%) was instilled into one of the cotton balls. Mice harboring a light reflector were placed at the center of the cage. Behaviors of the mice were recorded with an infrared digital video camera (Sony, Tokyo, Japan) for 3 min. The recorded motion pictures were analyzed with an NIH image on a personal computer (Apple), and position coordinates of mice at each time point were calculated. The cage area was divided into four (acetic acid area, cross area, and two side areas) (see Fig. 2), and the percentage of time spent at each area was estimated. Statistical Analysis—Significant values were determined by analyzing data with the Mann-Whitney’s U test using StatView version 4.5J for Macintosh (Abacus Concepts, Berkley, CA). A level of p <0.05 was considered significant. HSF1 Is Required for Normal Development of the Nasal Cavity—Previously, we showed that HSF4 is required for maturation of the eye lens, while HSF1 competes or cooperates with HSF4 in regulation of heat shock genes and growth factor genes (13Fujimoto M. Izu H. Seki K. Fukuda K. Nishida T. Yamada S. Kato K. Yonemura S. Inouye S. Nakai A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4297-4306Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next examined the morphology of other sensory organs in HSF1- and HSF4-null adult ICR strain mice. We found normal morphology in the ear (30Sugahara K. Inouye S. Izu H. Katoh Y. Katsuki K. Takemoto T. Shimogori H. Yamashita H. Nakai A. Hear. Res. 2003; 182: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), skin, and taste buds (data not shown) in both types of mice. Surprisingly, we found that the structure of the nasal cavity was abnormal in 6-week-old HSF1-null mice (Fig. 1A). Mice developed chronic sinusitis with accumulation of mucus, containing mostly dead cells (data not shown). Infiltration of leukocytes was hardly detected, excluding the possibility of bacterial infection due to impaired immunoglobulin production (15Inouye S. Izu H. Takaki E. Suzuki H. Shirai M. Yokota Y. Ichikawa H. Fujimoto M. Nakai A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38701-38709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The nasal cavity area increased, which was associated with marked decreases in turbinate areas and calcified bone (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, atrophy of the olfactory epithelium was observed (Fig. 1B). The thickness of the olfactory epithelium at the septum in HSF1-null mice decreased by ∼50% compared with that in wild-type mice. We found an increase in TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells, but electron microscopic analysis showed that necrotic olfactory nerve cells were dominant in the HSF1-null olfactory epithelium. Similar phenotypes were also observed in HSF1-null mice of the C57Bl/6 strain (data not shown). These data indicated that HSF1 is required for normal development of the nasal cavity. A major role of the nasal cavity is to sense smell. To estimate olfaction, we monitored olfactory behavior of mice. Cotton balls were placed at four corners in a cage, and acetic acid solution was instilled in one cotton ball. We found that wild-type mice evaded the cotton ball containing acetic acid, whereas HSF1-null mice did not (Fig. 2). This result suggests that olfaction is disturbed in HSF1-null mice. HSF1 Is Indispensable for Maintenance of the Olfactory Epithelium in Mice over 4-Weeks-old—We next examined developmental stages at which abnormalities appear in the nasal cavity. We detected no abnormality in the 3-week-old HSF1-null nasal cavity by morphological examination (Fig. 3A). Cell growth determined by BrdUrd incorporation and spontaneous cell death assayed by TUNEL staining were at normal levels in the 3-week-old HSF1-null olfactory epithelium (Fig. 3, D and E). In 4-week-old HSF1-null mice, however, we detected accumulation of mucus in the nasal cavity and atrophy of the olfactory epithelium (Fig. 3A). In wild-type mice, the number of BrdUrd-incorporated cells in the olfactory epithelium significantly decreased at 4 weeks compared with that at 3 weeks (Fig. 3D) (31Weiler E. Farbman A.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3610-3622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, the number of BrdUrd-incorporated cells in the olfactory epithelium of 4-week-old HSF1-null mice (4.2 ± 2.8 cells/field) was much lower than that in the epithelium of the same age wild-type mice (0.2 ± 0.4 cells/field). Furthermore, the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells in the olfactory epithelium of 4-week-old HSF1-null mice was markedly higher than that in the epithelium of the same age wild-type mice (Fig. 3E). These results indicated that HSF1 is not required for development of the olfactory epithelium until 3 weeks of age but is indispensable for maintenance of the olfactory epithelium in mice over 4 weeks old. Induction of HSP Expression and Activation of HSF1 in Puberal Olfactory Epithelium Lack in HSF1-null Mice—As expression of Hsp genes and some growth factor genes was directly regulated by HSF1 and HSF4 (13Fujimoto M.

Chem. 2004; 279: 38701-38709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we first analyzed expression of HSPs in the developing olfactory epithelium. We found that in wild-type mice expression levels of HSP27, HSP70, HSP90, and HSP110 were high in the sustentacular cells at 3 weeks of age and that the HSP levels increased in both sustentacular cells and olfactory sensory neurons at 4 and 6 weeks of age (Fig. 3A). In 3-week-old HSF1-null mice, expression levels of HSPs in the olfactory epithelium were similar to those in the same age wild-type mice. Notably, expression levels of HSPs in both sustentacular cells and olfactory sensory neurons in HSF1-null mice decreased at 4 and 6 weeks of age. As a result, marked differences in expression levels of HSP27, HSP70, HSP90, and HSP110 were detected in the olfactory epithelium of 6-week-old wild-type and HSF1-null mice (Fig. 3, A–C). These results show that the appearance of abnormal cell growth and death of olfactory sensory neurons in HSF1-null mice is temporally correlated with decreased expression of HSPs. HSF2 and HSF4 expressions are regulated during development (7Kallio M. Chang Y. Manuel M. Alastalo T.P. Rallu M. Gitton Y. Pirkkala L. Loones M.T. Paslaru L. Larney S. Hiard S. Morange M. Sistonen L. Mezger V. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2591-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 13Fujimoto M. Izu H. Seki K. Fukuda K. Nishida T. Yamada S. Kato K. Yonemura S. Inouye S. Nakai A.

A. 1997; 94: 2392-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar); however, we do not know the developmental regulation of HSF1 expression or its activity. Therefore, we next examined whether HSF1 could be activated in the puberal olfactory epithelium. We found that levels of HSF1 protein were constant in the olfactory epithelia of 3-, 4-, and 6-week-old mice (Fig. 4A). HSF1 bands were composed of three major bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, but the profiles of these bands did not change during the observation period. Notably, we found that the DNA binding activity of HSF1 significantly increased in olfactory epithelium extracts of 4- and 6-week-old mice compared with that in an extract of 3-week-old mice (Fig. 4B). Thus, induction of HSPs is accompanied by activation of HSF1 in the olfactory epithelium of puberal mice. LIF Expression Increases in the HSF1-null Olfactory Epithelium—As growth, differentiation, and death of olfactory sensory neurons are regulated by many cytokines such as FGFs, BMPs, TGFs, and LIF (33Farbman A.I. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 34Mackay-Sim A. Chuau M.I. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 62: 527-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 35Schwob J.E. Anat. Rec. 2002; 269: 33-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), we analyzed expression of these cytokines by RT-PCR. Although some Fgf genes are direct target genes of HSFs (13Fujimoto M. Izu H. Seki K. Fukuda K. Nishida T. Yamada S. Kato K. Yonemura S. Inouye S. Nakai A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4297-4306Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), only a modest decrease in expression of FGF-18 and TGF-β2 (28 and 32%, respectively) was observed in the HSF1-null olfactory epithelium (Fig. 5A). In marked contrast, we found that LIF expression was notably higher in the HSF1-null olfactory epithelium as well as in the lung (Fig. 5, A and B). In wild-type mice, LIF expression was high at 3 weeks but markedly decreased at 6 weeks (Fig. 5C). In contrast, LIF expression continued to be high in the HSF1-null olfactory epithelium. As LIF inhibits maturation of olfactory sensory neurons (36Moon C. Yoo J.Y Matarazzo V. Sung Y.K. Kim E.J. Ronnett G.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9015-9020Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and overexpression of LIF leads to a reduction in thickness of the olfactory epithelium by inducing cell death (29Bauer S. Rasika S. Han J. Mauduit C. Raccurt M. Morel G. Jourdan F. Benahmed M. Moyse E. Patterson P.H. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1792-1803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), overexpression of LIF may partly cause abnormal development of HSF1-null olfactory sensory neurons. In addition to olfactory sensory neuron abnormalities, formation of calcified bone was strongly suppressed (Fig. 1A), probably due to abnormal gene regulation in the olfactory epithelium (37Dudley A.T. Tabin C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and IL-1β (38Bertolini D.R. Nedwin G.E.

Res. 1991; 6: 1277-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) act for bone resorption, and HSF1 suppresses expression of TNF-α and IL-1β (42Xiao X. Zuo X. Davis A.A. McMillan D.R. Curry B.B.

Chem. 2002; 277: 11802-11810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We also found increased expression of TNF-α and IL-1β in the HSF1-null epithelium (data not shown). HSF1 Binds Directly to the Lif Gene and Inhibits Its Expression—To determine whether HSF1 binds directly to the Lif gene, we searched HSE consensus sequences on the Lif gene. We found 15 upstream sites similar to an HSE consensus sequence in region within +100 to -900 bp from a transcription start site (Fig. 6, A and B) (45Stahl J. Gough N.M. Cytokine. 1993; 5: 386-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). ChIP analysis showed that HSF1 binds to the upstream region (-641 to -270) of the Lif gene in the olfactory epithelium of 8-week-old mice (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, we found that HSF1 exclusively binds to an HSE-R3 region (-474 to -270) (Fig. 6D). HSF1 did not bind to that region at 3 weeks but did at 4 weeks (Fig. 6E). These results indicate that HSF1 binds directly to the Lif gene in the adult olfactory epithelium. As HSF1 competes with HSF4 for expression of FGFs in lens epithelial cells (13Fujimoto M. Izu H. Seki K. Fukuda K. Nishida T. Yamada S. Kato K. Yonemura S. Inouye S. Nakai A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4297-4306Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), we next examined the olfactory epithelium in mice deficient for both HSF1 and HSF4 (double-null) (Fig. 7A). In contrast to severely damaged turbinates and atrophied olfactory epithelia in HSF1-null mice, the morphology of the turbinates and olfactory epithelium was partially restored in double-null mice. Increased expression of LIF in the HSF1-null olfactory epithelium was also restored in part in the double-null olfactory epithelium (Fig. 7B). These results indicate that HSF1 and HSF4 have opposing effects on LIF expression in the olfactory epithelium as well as on FGF expression in the lens. Consistent with these results, overexpression of an active HSF1 (HSF1ΔRD) (6Nakai A. Suzuki M. Tanabe M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1545-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) into HSF1-null mouse embryo fibroblasts reduced expression of LIF, whereas overexpression of HSF4b increased that (Fig. 7C). Taken together, these observations indicate that HSF1 directly binds to the Lif gene and inhibits its expression and that HSF4 competes with HSF1 on LIF expression. In this study, we showed that HSF1 is required for the maintenance of the olfactory epithelium in mice. We also showed previously that HSF4 is required for maintenance of the lens (13Fujimoto M. Izu H. Seki K. Fukuda K. Nishida T. Yamada S. Kato K. Yonemura S. Inouye S. Nakai A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4297-4306Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Taken together, the requirement of HSF1 or HSF4 in each component of sensory organs is restricted to mice of a postnatal age, at which time these organs are exposed to environmental stimuli (35Schwob J.E. Anat. Rec. 2002; 269: 33-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 46Bhat S.P. Prog. Drug Res. 2003; 60: 205-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the developmental relationship between the two components has been well documented. The three major sensory organs of the head develop from interactions of the neural tube with a series of epidermal thicknesses called cranial placodes (47Gilbert S.F. Developmental Biology. Sinauer Associates Inc., 2003Google Scholar). The olfactory placode gives rise to the olfactory epithelium, the lens placode to the lens, and the otic placode forms the inner ear. Among them, lens and olfactory precursors arise from a common territory surrounding the anterior neural plate at early developmental stages (48Bhattacharyya S. Bailey A.P. Bronner-Fraser M. Streit A. Dev. Biol. 2004; 271: 403-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a transcription factor, PAX6, is expressed in both the olfactory and lens placodes and is required for eye and nasal development (18Grindley J.C. Davidson D.R. Hill R.E. Development. 1995; 121: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Quinn J.C. West J.D. Hill R.E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 20Xu P.X. Woo I. Her H. Beier D.R. Maas R.L. Development. 1997; 124: 219-231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although different HSFs play dominant roles in the two sensory organs, our results demonstrating an HSF requirement for tissue maintenance further clarify the strong relationship between the two components. One of major findings in this study was that HSE binding activity of HSF1 is induced in the olfactory epithelium in postnatal 4-week-old mice (Fig. 4). Simultaneously, the levels of HSP27, HSP70, HSP90, and HSP110 increased strongly in sustentacular cells and mildly in olfactory sensory neurons, indicating that the potential of HSF1 to activate transcription is elevated. In the absence of HSF1, expression levels of HSPs decreased at 4 and 6 weeks compared with that at 3 weeks. These results indicate that expression of HSPs in the olfactory epithelium at 4 and 6 weeks depends on the activity of HSF1, whereas HSP expression at 3 weeks does not. This aspect is unique in HSF1 when compared with the transcription factors MASH1 and NGN1 that control early olfactory neurogenesis (49Guillemot F. Lo L.C. Johnson J.E. Auerbach A. Anderson D.J. Joyner A.L. Cell. 1993; 75: 463-476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 50Cau E. Casarosa S. Guillemot F. Development. 2002; 129: 1871-1880PubMed Google Scholar). As the protein level of HSF1 in the olfactory epithelium is constant from 3 to 6 weeks, HSF1 activity in this organ should be regulated post-translationally. It is interesting to note that the expression of γ-crystallins is induced in embryos even in the HSF4-null lens but decreases postnatally (13Fujimoto M. Izu H. Seki K. Fukuda K. Nishida T. Yamada S. Kato K. Yonemura S. Inouye S. Nakai A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4297-4306Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The expression level of HSF4, constitutively a DNA binding trimer, increases markedly soon after birth (13Fujimoto M. Izu H. Seki K. Fukuda K. Nishida T. Yamada S. Kato K. Yonemura S. Inouye S. Nakai A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4297-4306Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 51Somasundaram T. Bhat S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44497-44503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, HSF1 as well as HSF4 is activated postnatally by different mechanisms, and their activation is required to maintain expression of target genes. Proliferation and differentiation of the olfactory sensory neurons are regulated by many cytokines (33Farbman A.I. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 34Mackay-Sim A. Chuau M.I. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 62: 527-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 35Schwob J.E. Anat. Rec. 2002; 269: 33-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), including Fgf genes, whose expressions are regulated by HSFs in the lens (13Fujimoto M. Izu H. Seki K. Fukuda K. Nishida T. Yamada S. Kato K. Yonemura S. Inouye S. Nakai A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4297-4306Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Expressions of some of these genes decreased only modestly in the HSF1-null olfactory epithelium (Fig. 5). In marked contrast, we found that the level of LIF expression continued to be high in the adult HSF1-null olfactory epithelium. Although LIF expression is induced in injured olfactory sensory neurons (29Bauer S. Rasika S. Han J. Mauduit C. Raccurt M. Morel G. Jourdan F. Benahmed M. Moyse E. Patterson P.H. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1792-1803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our results indicate that HSF1 directly suppresses LIF expression in the olfactory epithelium of adult mice as well as in mouse embryo fibroblast cells. LIF is a polyfunctional cytokine and its expression is induced in many tissues; it is essential for normal development of olfactory sensory neurons as well as hippocampal development and blastocyst implantation (52Metcalf D. Stem Cells. 2003; 21: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that LIF expression should be inhibited by HSF1 during olfactory development. Continuous overexpression of LIF may greatly affect intracellular signalings in olfactory sensory neurons, in which decreased HSP expression causes altered protein homeostasis. It was shown previously that HSF1-null cells or tissues exhibit altered expression of many genes (8Wang G. Ying Z. Jin X. Tu N. Zhang Y. Phillips M. Moskophidis D. Mivechi N.F. Genesis. 2004; 38: 66-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 15Inouye S. Izu H. Takaki E. Suzuki H. Shirai M. Yokota Y. Ichikawa H. Fujimoto M. Nakai A. J. Biol.

Cell. 2004; 15: 1254-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). These analyses indicated that expression profiles of genes regulated by HSF1 are different in each cell type or tissue. Together with our results of expression profiles of direct target genes such as Fgf, Lif, and Il-6 (13Fujimoto M. Izu H. Seki K. Fukuda K. Nishida T. Yamada S. Kato K. Yonemura S. Inouye S. Nakai A.

https://openalex.org/W2102565806,"Duchenne/Becker and limb-girdle muscular dystrophies share clinical symptoms like muscle weakness and wasting but differ in clinical presentation and severity. To get a closer view on the differentiating molecular events responsible for the muscular dystrophies, we have carried out a comparative gene expression profiling of hindlimb muscles of the following mouse models: dystrophin-deficient (mdx, mdx(3cv)), sarcoglycan-deficient (Sgca null, Sgcb null, Sgcg null, Sgcd null), dysferlin-deficient (Dysf null, SJL(Dysf)), sarcospan-deficient (Sspn null), and wild-type (C57Bl/6, C57Bl/10) mice. The expression profiles clearly discriminated between severely affected (dystrophinopathies and sarcoglycanopathies) and mildly or nonaffected models (dysferlinopathies, sarcospan-deficiency, wild-type). Dystrophin-deficient and sarcoglycan-deficient profiles were remarkably similar, sharing inflammatory and structural remodeling processes. These processes were also ongoing in dysferlin-deficient animals, albeit at lower levels, in agreement with the later age of onset of this muscular dystrophy. The inflammatory proteins Spp1 and S100a9 were up-regulated in all models, including sarcospan-deficient mice, which points, for the first time, at a subtle phenotype for Sspn null mice. In conclusion, we identified biomarker genes for which expression correlates with the severity of the disease, which can be used for monitoring disease progression. This comparative study is an integrating step toward the development of an expression profiling-based diagnostic approach for muscular dystrophies in humans."

A crystal structure of the NS3 helicase domain (NS3h) was generated in the presence of a single-stranded oligonucleotide long enough to accommodate binding of two molecules of enzyme. Several amino acid residues at the interface of the two NS3h molecules were identified that appear to mediate a protein-protein interaction between domains 2 and 3 of adjacent molecules. Mutations were introduced into domain 3 to disrupt the putative interface and subsequently examined using an HCV subgenomic replicon, resulting in significant reduction in replication capacity. The mutations in domain 3 were then examined using recombinant NS3h in biochemical assays. The mutant enzyme showed RNA binding and RNA-stimulated ATPase activity that mirrored wild type NS3h. In DNA unwinding assays under single turnover conditions, the mutant NS3h exhibited a similar unwinding rate and only ∼2-fold lower processivity than wild type NS3h. Overall biochemical activities of the mutant NS3h were similar to the wild type enzyme, which was not reflective of the large reduction in HCV replicative capacity observed in the biological experiment.

Liver Dis. 2003; 7: 211-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Identification of a novel viral target for therapeutic intervention could lead to the development of a more effective treatment. The HCV genome is a 9.6-kb positive, single-stranded RNA that supports translation of a 3000-amino acid polyprotein, which is subsequently cleaved to produce both structural (C, E1, and E2) and nonstructural (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) viral proteins (5Blight K.J. Kolykhalov A.A. Reed K.E. Agapov E.V. Rice C.M. Antivir. Ther. 1998; 3: 71-81PubMed Google Scholar). Two viral proteases are encoded by the NS2 and NS3 genes (6Reed K.E. Grakoui A. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4127-4136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Bartenschlager R. Ahlborn-Laake L. Mous J. Jacobsen H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3835-3844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its protease domain, the NS3 protein also contains a DEXH/D-box helicase domain (8Kim D.W. Gwack Y. Han J.H. Choe J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). NS4A encodes a peptide co-factor for NS3 protease (9Failla C. Tomei L. De Francesco R. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3753-3760Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and NS5B encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (10Behrens S.E. Tomei L. De Francesco R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). The functions of NS4B and NS5A have not been as well characterized, but NS5A is involved in viral interferon sensitivity (11Enomoto N. Sakuma I. Asahina Y. Kurosaki M. Murakami T. Yamamoto C. Izumi N. Marumo F. Sato C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) and in adaptation of subgenomic replicons for growth in cultured hepatoma cells (12Blight K.J. Kolykhalov A.A. Rice C.M. Science. 2000; 290: 1972-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). One obstacle to studying viral protein interactions is that HCV cannot be maintained efficiently in cell culture, although recent progress may overcome this difficulty (13Heller T. Saito S. Auerbach J. Williams T. Moreen T.R. Jazwinski A. Cruz B. Jeurkar N. Sapp R. Luo G. Liang T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; Google Scholar). In order to circumvent this problem, selectable replicons carrying the neomycin phosphotransferase gene in addition to essential HCV genes and untranslated flanking regions have been constructed (14Lohmann V. Korner F. Koch J. Herian U. Theilmann L. Bartenschlager R. Science. 1999; 285: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (2485) Google Scholar). Viral genes are translated independently of the neomycin phosphotransferase gene from an encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosome entry site. Replication in cell culture has been further enhanced by the introduction of adaptive mutations primarily within the NS5A gene (12Blight K.J. Kolykhalov A.A. Rice C.M. Science. 2000; 290: 1972-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar), although the specific mechanism by which these mutations influence replication is not known. These adaptive replicon mutants provide a means of studying HCV replication in cultured cells. Many aspects of the HCV replication mechanism remain unknown, but it appears that at least five of the viral nonstructural proteins are required for replication (5Blight K.J. Kolykhalov A.A. Reed K.E. Agapov E.V. Rice C.M. Antivir. Ther. 1998; 3: 71-81PubMed Google Scholar). Several nonstructural protein-protein interactions have been identified (15Lin C. Thomson J.A. Rice C.M. J.

Understanding the mechanism of nucleic acid unwinding by NS3 is therefore a key step in characterizing the viral replication mechanism. Helicases are molecular motor proteins that utilize energy from ATP hydrolysis to manipulate nucleic acids as well as protein-nucleic acid complexes (19Delagoutte E. von Hippel P.H. Q. Rev.

NS3 helicase (NS3h) has been expressed and purified independently of NS3 protease in a recombinant bacterial system and retains its in vitro unwinding activity (8Kim D.W. Gwack Y. Han J.H. Choe J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The NS3h structure consists of three distinct domains, with domains 1 and 2 containing all of the conserved motifs common to superfamily II helicase enzymes (22Cho H.S. Ha N.C. Kang L.W. Chung K.M.

Interactions between the protein and nucleic acid are not sequence-specific and primarily involve the phosphate backbone of the nucleic acid. Despite extensive structural and biochemical characterization, the oligomeric state of the functional species of NS3 has not been determined conclusively. Biochemical studies have resulted in reports of monomeric (24Gallinari P. Brennan D. Nardi C. Brunetti M. Tomei L. Steinkuhler C. De Francesco R. J.

However, none of these structures includes a substrate molecule of sufficient length to accommodate binding of multiple NS3h monomers. Cross-linking experiments indicate that NS3h can form oligomeric structures in solution (28Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31839-31846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). DNA unwinding activity of full-length NS3 is optimal at concentrations high enough to allow binding of multiple NS3h monomers to each nucleic acid molecule (30Tackett A.J. Chen Y. Cameron C.E. Raney K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10797-10806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, no cooperative effect has been observed in binding studies (31Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29377-29385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), leaving open the possibility that NS3 is a nonprocessive monomer. A recently reported biochemical model suggests that monomeric NS3h is functional but that multiple NS3h molecules are required for optimal processivity (32Levin M.K. Wang Y.H. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26005-26012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We have crystallized NS3h bound to a 16-mer poly-dU nucleic acid. The structure shows two NS3h molecules bound to a single DNA molecule and reveals an apparent interface between the two protein molecules. A mutational analysis of the protein interface region was performed in order to determine its importance for helicase activity and viral replication. Purification of NS3h—BL21(DE3) cells were co-transformed with pET26b expression plasmid containing a wild type or mutant NS3h gene with an NH2-terminal ubiquitin tag and pCG1 expressing the ubiquitin protease Ubp1. 3.5 liters of transformed cells were cultured at 37 °C to an A600 of 1.5 in NZCYM broth containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Overexpression was induced by the addition of 3.5 liters of chilled NZCYM, 0.2% dextrose, and 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Antibiotic concentrations were kept constant. Cells were cultured at 15 °C for 16-18 h following induction. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. NS3h purification was followed by measuring poly(U)-dependent ATPase activity and by SDS-PAGE. Cells were centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min in a Beckman JLA-10.500 rotor and resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) at 5 ml/g. Cells were lysed by the addition of 4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 2.25 mg of lysozyme/g of cells, followed by a freeze/thaw in liquid nitrogen, pressurization at 1500 p.s.i. for 3 min in a nitrogen bomb, and sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 20 min in a Beckman JA-25.50 rotor. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 45,000 rpm for 2 h in a Beckman 50.2 Ti rotor. The supernatant from the final centrifugation was further purified by anion exchange chromatography. NS3h was eluted in the wash from the anion exchange column with lysis buffer and precipitated by the addition of 55% (NH4)2SO4 followed by centrifugation at 20,000 rpm for 60 min in a Beckman JA-25.50 rotor. Pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer plus 500 mm (NH4)2SO4. NS3h was further purified using methyl-hydrophobic (30 ml), heparin-Sepharose (30 ml), and poly(U) affinity (20 ml) chromatography columns. NS3h was eluted from each column with a low salt/high salt buffer gradient (10 mm/1 m NaCl in 25 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol). The gradient was reversed for the hydrophobic column. NS3h eluted from the hydrophobic and heparin-Sepharose columns between 250 and 450 mm NaCl and from the poly(U) column between 450 and 650 mm NaCl. Fractions containing NS3h were combined and dialyzed into low salt buffer following elution from each column. Fractions from the final column were dialyzed into storage buffer (25 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol) and concentrated to 7-10 μm. Crystallization and Structural Determination of NS3h—Purified NS3h was concentrated to 32.2 mg/ml for crystallization. Examination of sample purity and determination of molecular weight were performed using SDS-PAGE on a Phast Gel system (AP Biotech). The apparent molecular mass of the helicase was ∼50 kDa. The (dU)16 oligonucleotide was synthesized using an Expedite nucleic acid synthesis system and purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to a final concentration of 4.6 mg/ml. Immediately before crystallization, NS3h was mixed with the (dU)16 oligonucleotide at a 2:1 molar ratio. Crystals of diffraction quality were obtained by using the hanging drop method at room temperature with 4 μl of the mixture and 1 μl of reservoir solution (2.4 m (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 m Tris hydrochloride, pH 8.5). Diffraction data were collected at 1.5418 Å by using a single crystal of 0.2 × 0.4 × 0.1 mm mounted in a thin-walled glass capillary at room temperature. The x-ray radiation was produced by an in-house Rigaku RU-H3RHB generator and focused by Osmic's Gutman multilayer mirrors (Woodland, TX). The diffraction pattern was recorded on the R-AXIS IV phosphor image plate detector. The diffraction data were reduced, integrated, and scaled with Denzo/Scalepack. Molecular replacement analysis was performed using AMORE software (33Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), and structure refinements and model building/adjustment were done using CNS (34Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M.

The scaled data of resolution 3.3 Å indicated that the NS3h/(dU)16 crystal belongs to the orthorhombic space group (Table 1). Space group assignment between P21212 and P212121 could not be made due to the absence of some (00l) reflections. Matthews' coefficient suggested that the number of protein molecules in one asymmetric unit could be 3 or 4, with solvent content being 67 or 50%, respectively.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsParameterValueData collectionUnit cellα = β = γ = 90°A (Å)108.3B (Å)109.8C (Å)183.4Space groupP212121Wavelength (Å)1.5418Resolution (Å)3.3Unique reflections33,594Completeness (%)91.1RsymaRsym=∑|I−〈I〉|/∑I, where I represents intensity.

Prior to MR, the oligonucleotide was removed from the model. The MR results from space group P21212 did not display any reasonable correlation among the individual solutions; however, the MR solutions in space group P212121 showed strong correlation as well as realistic crystal packing (not shown). A composite omit map was calculated using CNS (34Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M.

The resulting electron density map showed clearly the presence of the oligonucleotide at the nucleic acid binding sites of the protein molecules. The (dU)x fragments were inserted manually into the structure using XtalView (35McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2020) Google Scholar). The maximum likelihood from structure factors refinement on the model was done in CNS and is presented in Table 1. Construction of Mutant Plasmids—Mutations were introduced into a pUC18-NS3 subclone containing nucleotides 1182-4918 from the HCV-neo-I377/NS3-3′-untranslated region replicon sequence (Gen-Bank™ accession number AJ242652) using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutant plasmids were transformed into SURE cells and purified from cultured cells with the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen). Mutant subcloned HCV sequences were then transferred into the replicon plasmid by digestion at PmeI and MluI restriction sites followed by ligation. Mutant NS3 sequences were transferred to pET26b-ubiquitin expression plasmid by PCR followed by digestion at SacII and EcoRI restriction sites and ligation. Quality of all final plasmid products was confirmed by sequencing. Replicon RNA Synthesis—DNA template was prepared by digestion of replicon plasmid (10 μg) with ScaI restriction endonuclease at 37 °C for 4 h. Complete linearization of plasmid was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. RNA was synthesized in vitro by incubating 0.5 μg of linear DNA template with 0.5 μg of T7 RNA polymerase in 350 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 32 mm magnesium acetate, 40 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm spermidine, and 28 mm NTPs at 37 °C for 3 h. Template DNA was removed by incubation with 2 units of DNase I at 37 °C for 30 min. RNA was precipitated overnight in LiCl at -20 °C. RNA purity and quality were verified by agarose gel electrophoresis. Colony Formation Assays—Huh-7.5 cells were trypsinized 1 day before transfection. Cells (2 × 106) were washed once with DMEM lacking serum and suspended in 0.9 ml of the same medium. RNA-liposome complexes were prepared using the TransMessenger reagent from Qiagen. Cells and and RNA-liposome complexes were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After incubation, cells were pelleted by centrifugation (525 × g) for 4 min and suspended in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were plated in 100-mm Petri dishes in the absence of feeder cells at the following densities: 1 × 106, 2 × 105, and 2 × 104. After 2 days of recovery, cells were treated with 0.5 mg/ml G418, and selection was continued for 3 weeks with medium changes every 4 days. Cells were fixed and stained using crystal violet. At least three independent experiments were performed for each transfection. Western Analysis—Huh-7.5 cells were transiently transfected with HCV RNA using TransMessenger Lipofectin Reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were lysed at 4 h post-transfection in SDS-PAGE denaturing sample buffer. Lysate from 5 × 105 cells from each transfection was run on 10% SDS gel. Proteins were transferred from gel to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a Bio-Rad electrophoretic transfer cell at 100 V for 1 h at 4°C in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine). Membranes were blocked in 5% dry milk/TBST (20 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h. Blocked membranes were exposed to rabbit polyclonal anti-NS3 in 5% bovine serum albumin/TBST for 90 min and then exposed to horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 5% dry milk/TBST for 1 h. Chemiluminescent detection was done by an ECL Western blotting analysis system (Amersham Biosciences). Nucleic Acid Binding Assays—NS3h was incubated with 500 pm 5′-fluorescein labeled rU20 (Integrated DNA Technologies) in 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 10 mm NaCl, 50 μm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 5 min at 37 °C. Binding was measured as a function of fluorescence polarization using a Beacon fluorescence polarization instrument. Data were fit to a hyperbola using Kaleidagraph software. ATPase Assays—NS3h was incubated with 5 mm ATP in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 4 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 10 units/ml pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase, and 0.7 mg/ml NADH. Absorbance of NADH at 380 nm was measured at 1-s intervals for a period of 30 s in the presence of the indicated concentrations of poly(U). Hydrolysis rates were calculated using an extinction coefficient of 1,210 m-1 cm-1 for NADH. Data were fit to a hyperbola using Kaleidagraph software. DNA Unwinding Assays—Unwinding assays were carried out using a Quench-Flow apparatus (RQF-3, KinTek Instruments, Austin, TX) and a two-step mixing protocol (32Levin M.K. Wang Y.H. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26005-26012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The temperature was held constant at 37 °C with a circulating water bath. Reactions were carried out in 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 10 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin; all concentrations are postmixing. NS3h (500 nm) was mixed with 2 nm DNA substrate (30-base pair duplex with 3′ T15 overhang; the longer strand was radiolabeled with 32P) for 10 s before adding 5 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 60 nm annealing trap (complementary to the displaced strand), and 100 μm poly(dT) protein trap. The reaction was quenched after 0.1-15 s by ejection into a tube containing 200 mm EDTA, 0.7% SDS. Double- and single-stranded DNA were resolved on a native 20% polyacrylamide gel, detected using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences), and quantified using ImageQuant software. Bench top experiments were used to determine the amplitude of product formation under single turnover conditions. NS3h was added to substrate (2 nm), followed by a 10-s incubation. ATP (5 mm), MgCl2 (10 mm), and a protein trap (poly(dT), 100 μm) were added to initiate the unwinding reaction. The reaction was stopped after 10 s by adding 200 mm EDTA. Data were fit to Equation 1, using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). This equation describes a five-step mechanism for DNA unwinding that is necessary to fit the substantial lag phase associated with unwinding of the substrate (32Levin M.K. Wang Y.H. Patel S.S. J.

We determined the structure by the MR method, using 1A1V.pdb (23Kim J.L. Morgenstern K.A. Griffith J.P. Dwyer M.D. Thomson J.A. Murcko M.A. Lin C. Caron P.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 89-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar) as an initial model, in which its (dU)8 fragment was manually removed prior to the rotational function search. We identified three helicase molecules (chains A, B, and C in Fig. 1) per asymmetric unit in our structure, with two helicase molecules bound to a single (dU)16 molecule. The final atomic model shows no major unfavorable steric interactions between the helicase molecules, and the crystal packing shows no conflicts between the protein molecules in adjacent asymmetric units. We found no apparent noncrystallographic symmetric operations among the three monomers in this helicase model, nor did we observe any dramatic differences among the monomers. All three helicase molecules retain the basic Y shape characteristic of previously reported structures, with minor conformational differences at the surface loop regions. Chains A and B of the complex are bound to a 13-nucleotide span of one (dU)16 molecule, with chain B rotated 90° relative to chain A. The binding mode of both chains is consistent with that of the 1A1V structure, with the binding cleft at the interface of domains 1 and 2 with domain 3 in each protein molecule. Chain C appears to be independent of the dimer-oligonucleotide complex. The nucleic acid binding cleft of chain C faces away from the dimer structure and is occupied by a second oligonucleotide molecule. Chain C does not have any evident structural or mechanistic relationship with the other two protein molecules, and there appear to be no suitable contacts between chains B and C to indicate a functional interaction between these two molecules. To determine the degree of similarity between chains A and B, we superimposed the two using domain 1 (the NTPase domain) as an anchor (the backbone r.m.s. deviation for residues 190-324 was 0.7 Å). We observed only minor conformational differences between the two chains in each of the three domains (Fig. 2). However, it appears that the relative orientation of domain 2 with respect to the anchored domain 1 is slightly different between chains A and B with a small but detectable tilting angle, resulting in a slight widening of the nucleic acid binding groove in chain B. This flexibility of domain 2 relative to domain 1 is consistent with the ratchet mechanism for nucleic acid translocation proposed by Kim et al. (23Kim J.L. Morgenstern K.A. Griffith J.P. Dwyer"
https://openalex.org/W2032659166,"Rhabdoid tumors (RTs) are aggressive and currently incurable pediatric malignancies. INI1/hSNF5 is a tumor suppressor biallelically inactivated in RTs. Our previous studies have indicated that cyclin D1 is a key downstream target of INI1/hSNF5 and genesis and/or survival of RTs in vivo is critically dependent on the presence of cyclin D1. In this report, we have tested the hypothesis that therapeutic targeting of cyclin D1 is an effective means of treating RTs. We found that RNA interference of cyclin D1 in rhabdoid cells was sufficient to induce G1 arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that pharmacological intervention with low micromolar concentrations of N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (4-HPR), which downmodulates cyclin D1, induced G1 arrest and apoptosis in rhabdoid cell lines. 4-HPR in combination with 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4OH-Tam), synergistically inhibited survival as well as anchorage-dependent and -independent growth of rhabdoid cells and caused synergistic induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. 4-HPR and tamoxifen exhibited synergistic growth inhibition of RTs in xenograft models in vivo. The effects of combination of drugs were correlated to the depletion of cyclin D1 levels both in in vitro and in vivo tumor models. These results demonstrate that 4-HPR and tamoxifen are effective chemotherapeutic agents for RTs. We propose that downmodulation of cyclin D1 is a novel and effective therapeutic strategy for RTs."
https://openalex.org/W2127114313,"Studies have indicated the role of HSF1 (heat-shock transcription factor 1) in repressing the transcription of some nonheat shock genes. XAF1 (XIAP-associated factor 1) was an inhibitor of apoptosis-interacting protein with the effect of antagonizing the cytoprotective role of XIAP. XAF1 expression was lower in gastrointestinal cancers than in normal tissues with the mechanism unclear. Here we showed that gastrointestinal cancer tissues expressed higher levels of HSF1 than matched normal tissues. The expression of XAF1 and HSF1 was negatively correlated in gastrointestinal cancer cell lines. Stress stimuli, including heat, hypo-osmolarity, and H2O2, significantly suppressed the expression of XAF1, whereas the alteration of HSF1 expression negatively correlated with XAF1 expression. We cloned varying lengths of the 5′-flanking region of the XAF1 gene into luciferase reporter vectors, and we evaluated their promoter activities. A transcription silencer was found between the –592- and –1414-nucleotide region that was rich in nGAAn/nT-TCn elements (where n indicates G, A, T, or C). A high affinity and functional HSF1-binding element within the –862/–821-nucleotide region was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Inactivation of this “heat-shock element” by either site-directed mutation or an HSF1 inhibitor, pifithrin-α, restored the promoter activity of the silencer structure. Moreover, pretreatment with antioxidants suppressed HSF1 binding activity and increased the transcriptional activity and expression of XAF1. These findings suggested that endogenous stress pressure in cancer cells sustained the high level expression of HSF1 and subsequently suppressed XAF1 expression, implicating the synergized effect of two anti-apoptotic protein families, HSP and inhibitors of apoptosis, in cytoprotection under stress circumstances.

Inactivation of this “heat-shock element” by either site-directed mutation or an HSF1 inhibitor, pifithrin-α, restored the promoter activity of the silencer structure. Moreover, pretreatment with antioxidants suppressed HSF1 binding activity and increased the transcriptional activity and expression of XAF1. These findings suggested that endogenous stress pressure in cancer cells sustained the high level expression of HSF1 and subsequently suppressed XAF1 expression, implicating the synergized effect of two anti-apoptotic protein families, HSP and inhibitors of apoptosis, in cytoprotection under stress circumstances.

The expression of these proteins is very low under normal physiological conditions and can be induced by stress factors, including physiological (growth factors, oxidative stress, and hormonal stimulation), environmental (heat shock, heavy metals, and ultraviolet radiation), or pathological stimuli (inflammation and autoimmune reactions and viral, bacteriological, or parasitic infections) (3Carper S.W. Duffy J.J. Gerner E.W. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 5249-5255PubMed Google Scholar, 4Trautinger F. Kindas-Mugge I. Knobler R.M. Honigsmann H. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1996; 35: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Some stress factors, such as oxidative stress, have been considered as tumorigenic agents at low concentrations (5Wang D. Kreutzer D.A. Essigmann J.M. Mutat. Res. 1998; 400: 99-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 6Wei H. Med. Hypotheses. 1992; 39: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The main function of HSPs is to operate as an intracellular chaperone for aberrantly folded or mutated proteins and to provide cytoprotection against the stress conditions (31Garrido C. Gurbuxani S. Ravagnan L. Kroemer G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). For this reason, the presence of a cellular stress response in cancer cells reduces their sensitivity to chemical stress caused by insufficient tumor perfusion of chemotherapeutic agents (2Sarto C. Binz P.A. Mocarelli P. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 1218-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).Heat-shock transcription factors (HSFs or HSTFs) were originally characterized as regulators of the expression of the heat-shock protein, through binding to specific sequences (“heat-shock element” (HSE)), typically a pentanucleotide nGAAn structure (where n indicates G, A, T, or C) oriented in inverted dyad repeats (7Kroeger P.E. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7592-7603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wang Y. Morgan W.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3113-3118Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The HSF family consists of three members in human, namely HSF1, HSF2, and HSF4. HSF1 is specifically responsible for the stress-mediated HSP induction. In unstressed cells, HSF1 is present in the cytoplasm either as a monomer or forming heteromeric complexes. Upon treatment with stress inducers, HSF1 homotrimerizes, translocates to the nucleus, and binds the HSE for its transactivation capacity (9Mivechi N.F. Shi X.Y. Hahn G.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 59: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 10Pirkkala L. Nykanen P. Sistonen L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1118-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that HSF1 can also act as a negative regulator of certain nonheat-shock genes, including IL-1β, c-fos, and TNF-α (11Cahill C.M. Waterman W.R. Xie Y. Auron P.E.

Chem. 2002; 277: 4981-4988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).Inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) constitute another family of anti-apoptotic proteins. They were identified in baculoviruses where they function to prevent the death of infected host cells (14Hay B.A. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1045-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). XIAP is a potent member of IAPs that is expressed in all adult and fetal tissues with the exception of peripheral blood leukocytes. XIAP binds directly to caspases and functions as a competitive inhibitor of caspase catalytic function (15Arnt C.R. Chiorean M.V. Heldebrant M.P. Gores G.J. Kaufmann S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44236-44243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar).Yeast two-hybrid studies identified a XIAP-interacting N-terminal zinc finger protein designated XAF1 (XIAP-associated factor-1) (16Fong W.G. Liston P. Rajcan-Separovic E. St Jean M. Craig C. Korneluk R.G. Genomics. 2000; 70: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The incubation of recombinant XIAP with caspase-3 in the absence or presence of XAF1 demonstrated that XAF1 blocked the inhibitory activity of XIAP for caspase-3, and co-expression of XAF1 and XIAP inhibited XIAP-dependent caspase-3 suppression (17Liston P. Fong W.G. Kelly N.L. Toji S. Miyazaki T. Conte D. Tamai K. Craig C.G. McBurney M.W. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). XAF1 has been implicated as a tumor suppressor because its expression was lower in tumor cells than in normal tissues, and transient expression of XAF1 sensitized tumor cells to the pro-apoptotic effects of etoposide as well as tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (17Liston P. Fong W.G. Kelly N.L. Toji S. Miyazaki T. Conte D. Tamai K. Craig C.G. McBurney M.W. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 18Leaman D.W.

In gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, Byun et al. (23Byun D.S. Cho K. Ryu B.K. Lee M.G. Kang M.J. Kim H.R. Chi S.G. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7068-7075PubMed Google Scholar) reported gastric cancer tissues expressed lower levels of XAF1 than normal tissues. However, few studies have focused on the regulation of XAF1. In this study, we described the presence of a high affinity HSF1-binding sequence within the 5′-flanking region of the XAF1 gene. GI cancer cells expressed high levels of HSF1, which enhanced cell survival under stress stimulation, by negatively regulating XAF1 expression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPrimers, Oligonucleotides, and Probes—All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Proligo, Singapore.

Goat anti-human XAF1 (C-16), goat anti-human actin (I-19), normal goat IgG, goat anti-human HSTF-1 (C-19), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG were all purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).Tissue Specimens and Human Cell Lines—Three gastric cancer and nine colon cancer specimens and their adjacent normal tissues were obtained from patients by surgical resection in the Nanfang Hospital (Guangzhou, China). All colon tissues were from sporadic colon cancer patients. Tissue specimens were snap-frozen in liquid N2 and stored at –70 °C until used. Tissue slices were subjected to histopathological review, and tumor specimens consisting of at least 80% carcinoma cells were chosen for molecular analysis. Gastric cancer cell lines AGS and Kato-III and colon cancer cell lines SW1116, HT-29, Lovo, and Colo205 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Gastric cancer cell lines MKN45 and BCG823 were maintained by our laboratory and were described in a previous study (21Wong B.C. Jiang X.H. Lin M.C. Tu S.P. Cui J.T. Jiang S.H. Wong W.M. Yuen M.F. Lam S.K. Kung H.F. Gastroenterology. 2004; 126: 136-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). They were all maintained in RPMI1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with an atmosphere of 5% CO2. For stress treatment, the cells were incubated in complete medium at 42 °C (heat stress (HS)) or in hypo-osmotic (HO) medium for 30 min, followed by culture in normal medium at 37 °C for 24 h. The hypoosmotic medium contained 67% complete medium and 33% sterile double distilled water with the osmolarity of about 209 mosm/kg. For oxidative stress, the cells were exposed to 200 μm of H2O2 for various time points.Transient Transfection—For transient transfection, 4 μg of the pcDNA3.1 construct encoding HSF1 (pcDNA3.1/HSF1, kindly provided by Dr. R. E. Kingston) was mixed with 250 μl of serum and antibiotics-free medium containing 10 μl of LipofectAMINE2000 reagent for 20 min at room temperature. The mixtures were overlaid onto monolayers of cells seeded in a 6-well tissue culture plate preincubated under serum-free conditions. After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, the DNA-liposome complex was replaced with complete medium without antibiotics and cultivated at 37 °C. Whole cell lysates were prepared 48 h later to evaluate the protein expression.Immunoblotting—The whole cell lysates were prepared with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). To prepare protein sample for tissue specimens, homogenization was performed in protein lysis buffer. The protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA protein assay kit, Pierce) with bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as the standard. Equal aliquots of total cell lysates (30 μg) were solubilized in sample buffer and electrophoresed on denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel (5% stacking gel and 12% separating gel). The proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Nonspecific binding was blocked with 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer saline, pH 7.6, plus 0.05% Tween 20 containing 2% skimmed milk. The blots were probed with primary anti-human XAF1 antibody for 1 h at room temperature followed by the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat secondary antibody. Goat anti-human actin antibody (1:1000) was used as an internal control. Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences).5′-RACE—To extend the cDNA transcript, 5′-extension PCRs were performed by using SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) with Human Colon 5′-STRETCH PLUS cDNA Library (Clontech) as the template, as described previously (19Syagailo Y.V. Okladnova O. Reimer E. Grassle M. Mossner R. Gattenlohner S. Marx A. Meyer J. Lesch K.P. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 294: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, the first round of touchdown PCR was performed using HotStart Taq polymerase (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with AP1 (adapter primer 1) provided by the kit and the XAF1 GSP1 (gene-specific reverse primer 1). The PCR product was separated in a 1% gel. Because no intensified PCR product was found under UV light, a pair of nested primers was used to re-amplify the PCR product by using AP2 (adapter primer 2) provided by the kit and XAF1 GSP2. Both GSP1 and GSP2 were located at exon 2 of XAF1 gene. The sequences of primers are listed in Table 1. The conditions of touchdown PCR were as follows: 94 °C for 30 min; 5 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 4 min; 5 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s and 70 °C for 4 min; and 25 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 4 min. The PCR product was separated in a 1% gel. DNA was isolated using a GFX PCR DNA and gel band purification kit (Amersham Biosciences) and cloned into a pGEMT-T cloning vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Plasmid DNAs were purified using a commercial kit (Promega) and sequenced using the ABI PRISM 377 DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems), according to the manufacturer's instructions.Generation of XAF1-Promoter Luciferase Constructs—Genomic DNA was isolated from cancer cells by proteinase K digestion and sequential phenol extraction. To locate the regulatory promoter of XAF1, five DNA segments that shared the same proximal site and different distal sites were obtained by PCR amplification. The distal sites were located at –1414, –920, –592, –254, and –107 nt, respectively, and the proximal primers were located at –42 to –20 bp of the XAF1 gene. The upstream nucleotide adjacent to the translation starting ATG codon is defined here as –1 (20den Dunnen J.T. Antonarakis S.E. Hum. Genet. 2001; 109: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). KpnI site was added into the 5′ terminus of all of the forward primers, and the XhoI site was added into the reverse primer. The primers used were listed in the Table 1. Genomic DNA of AGS cell was used as the template for PCR amplification with HotStart Taq polymerase. PCR products were visualized on 1% agarose gels by ethidium bromide staining and were purified using GFX PCR DNA and gel band purification kit (Amersham Biosciences). After digestion of both the pGL3 basic vector (Promega) and the PCR products with KpnI and XhoI, the purified products were inserted in the forward orientation upstream of a luciferase reporter gene of pGL3 basic vector to generate pLuc-1414, pLuc-920, pLuc-592, pLuc-254, and pLuc-107 constructs.XAF1 Promoter-Luciferase Reporter Expression—For luciferase assay, the cells were seeded into 24-well plates to 70–80% confluence and transfected with the various pLuc constructs by Lipofectamine 2000 as described previously (21Wong B.C. Jiang X.H. Lin M.C. Tu S.P. Cui J.T. Jiang S.H. Wong W.M. Yuen M.F. Lam S.K. Kung H.F. Gastroenterology. 2004; 126: 136-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). pRL-CMV (Promega) was used to normalize the reporter gene activity. 0.8 μg of pLuc plasmids and 0.008 μg of pRL-CMV vector were mixed with 50 μl of serum and antibiotics-free medium containing 4 μl of LipofectAMINE2000 reagent for 20 min at room temperature. The mixtures were overlaid onto monolayers of the various cell lines preincubated under serum-free conditions. After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, the DNA-liposome complex was replaced with complete medium without antibiotics and cultivated for an additional 48 h at 37 °C. Cells were solubilized in 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega), scraped with a rubber policeman, and mixed with 50 μl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega). The firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) with a model TD-20/20 luminometer (EG & G Berthold, Australia). Firefly luciferase activity value was normalized to Renilla activity value. Promoter activity was presented as the fold of relative luciferase unit (RLU) compared with the basic vector control. RLU indicates values of firefly luciferase unit/values of Renilla luciferase unit.Preparation of Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Extract—After treatment, cells were resuspended in 400 μl of buffer A (containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A), lysed with 12.5 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and used as the cytoplasmic extracts. The nuclei pellet was resuspended in 40 μlof buffer B (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, containing 1.5 mm MgCl2, 450 mm NaCl, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A) and agitated for 60 min at 4 °C, and the nuclear debris was spun down at 20,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant (nuclear extract) was collected and stored at –80 °C until ready for analysis. Protein concentrations were determined with BCA protein assay kit.EMSA—Double-strand DNA probes were labeled with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). The labeled oligonucleotides were separated from the free [γ-32P]ATP using a column (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For EMSA, total reaction mixtures containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 4% glycerol, and 50 μg of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-C)/ml were incubated with 3 μg of nuclear extracts and various unlabeled competing oligonucleotides for 10 min at room temperature, followed by addition of 1 μl ((0.5–2) × 105 cpm) of 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotides. Samples were separated by electrophoresis on 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, with detection of radioactive bands by autoradiography for 16–24 h at –80 °C.siRNA Transfection—The siRNA duplexes consisted of 21 bp with a 2-base deoxynucleotide overhang (Proligo, Singapore). The sequences of the HSF1 siRNA were as follows (sense strand): siRNA 1, GAUGGCGGCGGCCAUGCUGdTdT. The control siRNA, GL2 (CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGA), was directed against the luciferase gene. The cells were transfected with siRNA duplexes using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.ChIP Assay—The ChIP assays were performed according to the protocol provided by the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, Lake Placid, NY). Briefly, cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde to cross-link proteins to DNA. After washing, the cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer and sonicated to yield an average DNA size of 500 bp. Sonicated extracts were subsequently clarified by centrifugation and diluted with ChIP dilution buffer. 20 μl of the diluted lysates was left as the input control. Other lysates were pre-cleared with protein A-agarose/salmon sperm DNA and then divided into two fractions and incubated with 5 μg of normal goat IgG or goat anti-human HSTF-1 antibody each. Protein A-agarose/salmon sperm DNA was added to each fraction and rotated at 4 °C. After thoroughly washing, immunoprecipitated products were eluted using elution buffer. The cross-linked DNA-protein complexes were reversed by heating at 65 °C. DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Quantitation of the DNA from the XAF1 promoter regions was determined by PCR using gene-specific primers as described in Table 1. Hotstart PCR amplification was performed by using either immunoprecipitated DNA, a control with goat IgG, or chromatin input that had not been immunoprecipitated. To ensure linear amplification of DNA, pilot PCRs were performed initially to determine the optimal PCR conditions. In general, samples were heated at 95 °C for 30 min, followed by 34 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. After cycling, samples were incubated at 72 °C for 7 min to permit completion of primer extension.Site-directed Mutagenesis—The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to generate constructs with mutation of HSF-binding elements. Briefly, the pLuc-920 construct was PCR-amplified in the elongation process by using Pfu DNA polymerase and primers (Table 1) with the mutation of the predicted HSF1-binding elements. The incorporation of oligonucleotide primers generated a mutated plasmid containing staggered nicks. The product was then treated with DpnI endonuclease, specific for methylated and hemimethylated DNA, and hence the parental DNA template was digested (because DNA originating from Escherichia coli is usually dam methylated). The nicked vector DNA carrying the desired mutations was proliferated in Epicurian coli XL1-Blue supercompetent cells. Plasmid DNA was isolated and sequenced to verify the prospective mutated sequence.Statistical Analysis—Results obtained from triplicate luciferase experiments were expressed as the mean ± S.D. RLU with different treatments were compared using a two-tailed Student's t test and were considered significant if the p value was less than 0.05.RESULTSGastric and Colon Cancer Expressed Higher Levels of HSF1 Than Normal Tissues—We detected HSF1 expression in three gastric cancer (Fig. 1A) and nine colon cancer (Fig. 1B) specimens and matched normal tissues by immunoblotting assay. All of the gastric cancer tissues and 7 of 9 colon cancer tissues expressed higher level of HSF1 than normal tissues. To evaluate the activity of HSF1, double-strand DNA probe consensus to the HSE sequence of human HSP70 promoter (HSE/consensus, Fig. 4B) was labeled with 32P, and EMSA was carried out to detect its binding to the whole cell lysates of tissue specimens. It showed that 5 of 7 cancer tissues (GT1, GT2, CT1, CT2, and CT4) displayed higher binding activity than matched normal tissues (Fig. 1C). Because the HSF1 expression and activity reflected cellular stress status, these results inferred that cancer cells have encountered higher stress pressure than normal cells.FIGURE 4Analysis of 5′-flanking sequence of XAF1 gene. A, consensus sequence of HSE. B, HSE sequence presented in human HSP70 promoter. C, two nGAAn (nTTCn)-rich sequences presented in the 5′-flanking region of the XAF1 gene.

As shown in Fig. 2A, negative correlation was found between these two proteins in 6 of 7 cell lines except gastric cancer cell line MKN45. Second, to confirm the down-regulation of XAF1 by HSF1, we next transfected AGS and Lovo cells with pCDNA3.1-HSF1 expressing vector and detected XAF1 expression. We showed that overexpression of HSF1 down-regulated XAF1 expression in both cell lines (Fig. 2B). Third, we suppressed HSF1 expression by RNA interference (Fig. 2C). Consequently, XAF1 expression was up-regulated (Fig. 2C). These findings indicated that the low level expression of XAF1 in cancer cells might be attributed to the high expression of HSF1 and stress pressure.FIGURE 2XAF1 expression inversely correlated with HSF1 in GI cancer cells. A, immunoblotting assay for HSF1 and XAF1 expression in GI cancer cell lines. B, AGS and Lovo cells were transfected with empty vector or pcDNA3.1-HSF1 construct for 48 h. HSF1 and XAF1 expressions were detected by immunoblotting. C, AGS cell was transfected without or with GL2 (control) or HSF1 siRNA for 48 h, and HSF1 and XAF1 expressions were detected by immunoblotting with actin as the internal control. This experiment was repeated twice in both AGS and Lovo cells with identical findings. D, Kato-III cell was treated with 200 μm of H2O2 for 24 h and HS (42 °C) or HO for 30 min followed by culture in standard medium for 24 h. HSF1 and XAF1 expressions were detected by immunoblotting. These figures are representative of two to three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test the effect of HSF1 activator (stress stimuli) on XAF1 expression, we then treated gastric cancer cell Kato-III, which constitutively express XAF1, with oxidation (200 μm of H2O2), HO (for 30 min), or HS (42 °C for 30 min).

https://openalex.org/W2021870555,"Human melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer and is extremely resistant to radiation and chemotherapy. One of the critical parameters of this resistance is down-regulation of Fas (CD95) cell-surface expression. Using TIG3 normal human fibroblasts and human melanoma cell lines, we investigated transcriptional regulation of FAP-1, a regulator of Fas translocation in the cell. Protein-tyrosine phosphatase FAP-1 (PTPN13, PTP-BAS) interacts with human Fas protein and prevents its export from the cytoplasm to the cell surface. In contrast, dynamin-2 facilitates Fas protein translocation from the Golgi apparatus via the trans-Golgi network to the cell surface. Suppression of dynamin functions by dominant negative dynamin K44A blocks Fas export, whereas the down-regulation of FAP-1 expression by specific RNA interference restores Fas export (a phenomenon that could still be down-regulated in the presence of dominant-negative dynamin). Based on the FAP-1- and dynamin-dependent regulation of Fas translocation, we have created human melanoma lines with different levels of surface expression of Fas. Treatment of these melanoma lines with soluble Fas ligand resulted in programmed cell death that was proportional to the pre-existing levels of surface Fas. Taking into consideration the well known observations that FAP-1 expression is often up-regulated in metastatic tumors, we have established a causal connection between high basal NF-κB transcription factor activity (which is a hallmark of many types of metastatic tumors) and NF-κB-dependent transcriptional regulation of FAP-1 gene expression that finally restricts Fas protein trafficking, thereby, facilitating the survival of cancer cells. Human melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer and is extremely resistant to radiation and chemotherapy. One of the critical parameters of this resistance is down-regulation of Fas (CD95) cell-surface expression. Using TIG3 normal human fibroblasts and human melanoma cell lines, we investigated transcriptional regulation of FAP-1, a regulator of Fas translocation in the cell. Protein-tyrosine phosphatase FAP-1 (PTPN13, PTP-BAS) interacts with human Fas protein and prevents its export from the cytoplasm to the cell surface. In contrast, dynamin-2 facilitates Fas protein translocation from the Golgi apparatus via the trans-Golgi network to the cell surface. Suppression of dynamin functions by dominant negative dynamin K44A blocks Fas export, whereas the down-regulation of FAP-1 expression by specific RNA interference restores Fas export (a phenomenon that could still be down-regulated in the presence of dominant-negative dynamin). Based on the FAP-1- and dynamin-dependent regulation of Fas translocation, we have created human melanoma lines with different levels of surface expression of Fas. Treatment of these melanoma lines with soluble Fas ligand resulted in programmed cell death that was proportional to the pre-existing levels of surface Fas. Taking into consideration the well known observations that FAP-1 expression is often up-regulated in metastatic tumors, we have established a causal connection between high basal NF-κB transcription factor activity (which is a hallmark of many types of metastatic tumors) and NF-κB-dependent transcriptional regulation of FAP-1 gene expression that finally restricts Fas protein trafficking, thereby, facilitating the survival of cancer cells.

The interaction between the Fas receptor and its ligand (FasL) initiates a complex pattern of intracellular events involving the recruitment of specific adaptor protein and procaspase-8 to the receptor followed by activation of caspase 8, caspase 8-dependent stimulation of the downstream effector caspases, and development of apoptosis (1Nagata S.

The level of surface expression of Fas is one of critical parameters in determining the ability of cells to undergo apoptosis. Expression of Fas on the cell surface is a multistage process that is regulated at different levels: (i) signaling pathways that target specific transcription factors are involved in the control of Fas gene expression; (ii) the transcription of the Fas gene driven by positive regulators (such as NF-κB (3Zheng Y.

Somatic mutagenesis of the Fas gene (15Peter M.E. Legembre P. Barnhart B.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1755: 25-36PubMed Google Scholar) and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms may affect the regulation of Fas expression or Fas-dependent death signaling, both of which are suppressed in metastatic cancer cells, often partially or almost completely (2Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2950-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 16Schulze-Bergkamen H. Krammer P.H. Semin.

The general role of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase FAP-1/PTP-Bas/PTPN13 in the negative regulation of Fas translocation among cancer cells has been previously described (11Ivanov V.N. Lopez Bergami P. Maulit G. Sato T.A. Sassoon D. Ronai Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3623-3635Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 12Ungefroren H. Kruse M.L. Trauzold A. Roeschmann S. Roeder C. Arlt A. Henne-Bruns D. Kalthoff H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2735-2746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is not surprising, however, that FAP-1 gene expression itself is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level. In the present study, based on the original observations demonstrating the presence of the putative NF-κB-binding elements in the promoter region of the FAP-1 gene (18Yoshida S. Harada H. Nagai H. Fukino K. Teramoto A. Emi M. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 47: 614-619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Irie S. Li Y. Kanki H. Ohyama T. Deaven L.L. Somlo S. Sato T.A. DNA Seq. 2001; 11: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we have established a role of NF-κBin this regulation. Conversely, NF-κB-dependent regulation of the Fas gene is well established (3Zheng Y. Ouaaz F. Bruzzo P. Singh V. Gerondakis S. Beg A.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4949-4957Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 5Chan H. Bartos D.P. Owen-Schaub L.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2098-2108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Simultaneous NF-κB-dependent control of the transcription of both the Fas receptor and its inhibitor, FAP-1 likely contributes to the heightened flexibility of the regulation of Fas surface expression, thereby creating certain restrictions in its surface expression level. Additionally, there is a highly important phase of Fas protein trafficking that occurs between the Golgi and the plasma membrane via the trans-Golgi network. Recent investigations in this area have established the critical role of dynamin-2 (Dyn-2) in the general regulation of post-Golgi trafficking (20Cao H. Weller S. Orth J.D. Chen J. Huang B. Chen J.L. Stamnes M. McNiven M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 21Cao H. Thompson H.M. Krueger E.W. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1993-2002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The particular questions raised (which have been thoroughly investigated in the present study) are linked with dynamin-dependent functions of Fas protein trafficking, as well as with the functional interference between FAP-1 and dynamin in the regulation of the Fas protein export. Finally, based on the FAP-1- and dynamin-dependent regulation of the Fas export, we have established melanoma cell lines with the regulated surface expression of the Fas receptor. The next critical issue resolved by the present study is that the treatment of these Fas-positive melanomas with soluble Fas ligand resulted in the programmed death of cancer cells, which was proportional to the pre-existing surface Fas levels. Materials—Sodium arsenite, cycloheximide, Brefeldin A, and tunicamycin were obtained from Sigma; tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)was purchased from Roche Applied Science.

FEMX and HHMSX human melanoma lines (26Myklebust A.T. Helseth A. Breistol K. Hall W.A. Fodstad O. J. Neurooncol. 1994; 21: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) were maintained in a RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. TIG3 human embryonic lung fibroblasts and HeLa human cervical carcinoma cells were maintained in a Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and antibiotics. FACS Analysis of Fas Levels—Surface and total levels (“total” meaning after cell permeabilization with BD Cytofix/Cytoperm) of Fas were determined by staining with the correspondent phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-human mAb and subsequent flow cytometry. Phycoerythrin-conjugated mouse IgG1 was used as a monoclonal immunoglobulin isotype control. A FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) combined with the CellQuest program was used to perform flow cytometric analysis with 40,000 cells for single color staining and with 80,000 cells for double color staining. All experiments were independently repeated four to five times. Transfection and Luciferase Assay—The NF-κB luciferase reporter containing two κB binding sites, Jun2-Luc reporter and empty vector tk-Luc (27van Dam H. Huguier S. Kooistra K. Baguet J. Vial E. van der Eb A.J. Herrlich P. Angel P. Castellazzi M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1227-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), were used to determine NF-κB and AP-1 transactivation. Additional reporter constructs used included: -1.7-kb FASpr-Luc (5Chan H. Bartos D.P. Owen-Schaub L.B. Mol. Cell.

Transient transfection of different reporter constructs (1 μg) together with pCMV-βgal (0.25 μg) into 5 × 105 melanoma cells was performed using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Proteins were prepared for β-galactosidase and luciferase analysis 16 h after transfection. Luciferase activity was determined using the Luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) and was normalized based on β-galactosidase levels. In some experiments, using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), melanoma cells were transfected with pEF-Fas-GFP expression constructs, either alone or in the presence of certain expression vectors, including: pCMV-FAP1 and pCMV-FAP1ΔCD (11Ivanov V.N.

Two parameters: 1) the percentage of Fas+ GFP+cells among GFP+cells and 2) the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of surface Fas levels were used to evaluate the efficiency of surface Fas-GFP translocation. Flow cytometry was performed using a FAC-SCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) in conjunction with the CellQuest program. The specific activity of β-galactosidase was used for the normalization of the efficiency of transfection. Tet-off HeLa system expressing mutant, dynamin-1 K44A (33Damke H. Binns D.D. Ueda H. Schmid S.L. Baba T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2578-2589Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Dr. S. L. Schmid (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). Treatment and Apoptosis Studies—Cells were exposed to soluble FasL (50 ng/ml) in combination with cycloheximide (1 μg/ml). Apoptosis was then assessed by quantifying the percentage of hypodiploid nuclei undergoing DNA fragmentation (34Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4421) Google Scholar). Flow cytometric analysis was performed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. FAP-1 Suppression by RNAi—The pSUPER retro (pRS) RNA interference (RNAi) system (Oligoengine, Seattle, WA), which has been utilized for the production of small RNAi transcripts used to suppress FAP-1 expression, was previously described (11Ivanov V.N. Lopez Bergami P. Maulit G. Sato T.A. Sassoon D. Ronai Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3623-3635Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis and Immunoprecipitation—Total cell lysates (50–100 μg of protein) were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and processed according to standard protocols. The antibodies used for Western blotting included monoclonal anti-β-Actin (Sigma); monoclonal anti-dynamin-1 and anti-dynamin-2 (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY); monoclonal anti-human Fas (G254–274). Polyclonal anti-FAP-1 antibody was kindly provided by T. A. Sato (Columbia University, NY). Optimal dilutions of primary Abs were 1:1,000 to 1:10,000. The secondary Abs (anti-rabbit or anti-mouse) were conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (dilution 1:5,000 to 1:10,000); signals were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Total levels of Fas were determined by using the immunoprecipitation of total cell extracts with anti-human Fas mAb and G-protein-Sepharose beads (Sigma) combined with subsequent Western analysis. Fas-GFP-fused protein was immunoprecipitated either with anti-Fas or anti-GFP Abs, with subsequent Western analysis using anti-Fas mAb. Cell-surface Labeling with Biotin—Biotinylation of cell-surface proteins was performed using EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Cell proteins were dissolved using 1% Triton X-100, 0.14 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm leupeptin, 2 mm aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Biotinylated proteins were precipitated using Streptavidin-agarose beads, dissolved in sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis followed by Western blot analysis with anti-Fas Ab. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed for the detection of NF-κB DNA-binding activity as previously described (35Ivanov V. Fleming T.J. Malek T.R. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2394-2406PubMed Google Scholar), using the labeled double strand oligonucleotide AGCTTGGGGACTTTCCAGCCG. (Binding sites are underlined.) Ubiquitous NF-Y DNA-binding activity was used as an internal control (35Ivanov V. Fleming T.J. Malek T.R. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2394-2406PubMed Google Scholar). Fas Receptor Translocation to the Cell Surface—We and others have previously observed that some cancer cell lines, such as human ocular melanoma OM431 and human metastatic melanomas LU1205 and HHMSX, contained a substantial cytoplasmic pool of Fas in complex with a scatter protein FAP-1 (11Ivanov V.N. Lopez Bergami P. Maulit G. Sato T.A. Sassoon D. Ronai Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3623-3635Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 12Ungefroren H. Kruse M.L. Trauzold A. Roeschmann S. Roeder C. Arlt A. Henne-Bruns D. Kalthoff H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2735-2746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TIG3 human embryonic lung fibroblasts express moderate levels of FAP-1, which interacts with endogenous cytoplasmic Fas, as shown by the coimmunoprecipitation of FAP-1 and Fas gp54 (Fig. 1A). Alternatively, most of the Fas receptor is located on the cell surface of FEMX cells (11Ivanov V.N. Lopez Bergami P. Maulit G. Sato T.A. Sassoon D. Ronai Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3623-3635Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) due to very low level of expression of the FAP-1 protein in these cells (Fig. 1A). We decided to use TIG3 cells as a model to study Fas trafficking due to the high transfection efficiency of these cells compared with most melanomas. In general, Fas protein translocation occurs in the cells using the conventional rules of protein receptor export to cell surface, showing dependence of corresponding post-translational modifications (glycosylation and phosphorylation), protein-protein interactions, and the integrity of the Golgi apparatus and the trans-Golgi network (TGN). As expected, brefeldin A (BFA, 100 ng/ml), an inhibitor of protein translocation from the endoplasmatic reticulum to the Golgi, and tunicamycin (5 μg/ml), a general inhibitor of protein N-glycosylation, notably suppressed endogenous surface expression of Fas in Fas-positive melanomas, including FEMX cells, 16 h after treatment (Fig. 1B). The effects of these agents on the surface expression of endogenous Fas in TIG3 cells were less pronounced due to the low basal levels of surface Fas expression on these cells. Based on our previous observations (11Ivanov V.N. Lopez Bergami P. Maulit G. Sato T.A. Sassoon D. Ronai Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3623-3635Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we transfected TIG3 cells with the pEF-Fas-GFP expression construct, which resulted in a high expression of surface Fas-GFP-fused protein. As expected, surface Fas expression was down-regulated after the cotransfection of Fas-GFP with FAP-1 expression vector (Fig. 1, C and D) due to a substantial deletion of the bright Fas-positive cells gated as the `H' rectangular in Fig. 1D. MFI, which determines levels of surface Fas expression, has been dramatically decreased, whereas total percentage of GFP+ cells was similar following cotransfection either with the empty vector or FAP-1 expression vector (Fig. 1D). This reflects a substantial retardation of Fas-GFP translocation in cells with FAP-1 overexpression. These results obtained with TIG3 cells are very similar to our previous observations on several melanoma cell lines (11Ivanov V.N. Lopez Bergami P. Maulit G. Sato T.A. Sassoon D. Ronai Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3623-3635Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore, biotinylation of the cell-surface proteins, their subsequent precipitation with Streptavidin-agarose, and immunoblotting with anti-Fas Ab detected Fas-GFP-fused protein on the cell surface. Cotransfection with FAP-1 expression vector substantially reduced Fas-GFP surface levels (Fig. 1E). As we previously demonstrated, the transfection of FEMX melanoma cells with pEF-Fas-GFP expression construct resulted in an appearance of fused Fas-GFP protein in the Golgi 8 h after transfection, followed by translocation of Fas-GFP via TGN to the cell surface 30 h after transfection (11Ivanov V.N. Lopez Bergami P. Maulit G. Sato T.A. Sassoon D. Ronai Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3623-3635Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Tunicamycin (Fig. 2) and BFA notably suppressed the trafficking of exogenous Fas-GFP protein in FEMX cells. Transfected FEMX cells with high levels of Fas-GFP expression on the cell surface acquired a high sensitivity to FasL-mediated death (11Ivanov V.N. Lopez Bergami P. Maulit G. Sato T.A. Sassoon D. Ronai Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3623-3635Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), whereas tunicamycin or BFA pretreatment partially suppressed this susceptibility. Conversely, N102P and N120P mutations in the glycosylation sites of Fas protein (36Itoh N. Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M. Mizushima S. Sameshima M. Hase A. Seto Y. Nagata S. Cell. 1991; 66: 233-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2674) Google Scholar) have differentially affected Fas-GFP translocation to the cell surface: N102P mutation had strong negative effects on Fas-GFP export in all tested lines, whereas levels of surface expression of Fas N120P differed greatly in distinct lines (data not shown). In TIG3 cells, Fas (N120P)-GFP-mutated protein can be detected, although at low levels in total cell extracts following immunoprecipitation; surface expression of this protein was very low (data not shown). Equal efficiency of transfection was proofed in these experiments by co-transfection of Fas expression constructs with pCMV-β-gal and determination of β-galactosidase activity. Transcriptional Regulation of FAP-1 Gene Expression: A Role of NF-κB—Because FAP-1 is a central negative regulator of Fas trafficking in human cells, it would be important to determine the mechanism behind the transcriptional control of endogenous FAP-1 gene expression. Furthermore, many human tumors possess high levels of expression of FAP-1 (synonyms: PTPN13, PTP-BAS, PTPL1, and hPTP1E) (37Erdmann K.S. Eur. J.

NF-κB has potential binding sites in the FAP-1 promoters (Fig. 3A) (19Irie S. Li Y. Kanki H. Ohyama T. Deaven L.L. Somlo S. Sato T.A.

This was a reason to determine whether this transcription factor is involved directly or indirectly in the regulation of FAP-1 expression.

However, influences of age-associated cellular alterations on the biochemistry of APP processing have not been studied in molecular detail so far. Here, we report that processing of endogenous APP is down-regulated during the aging of normal human fibroblasts (IMR-90). The generation of intracellular APP cleavage products C99, C83, and AICD gradually declines with increasing life span and is accompanied by a reduced secretion of soluble APP (sAPP) and sAPPα. Further, the maturation of APP was reduced in senescent cells, which has been shown to be directly mediated by age-associated increased cellular cholesterol levels. Of the APP processing secretases, protein levels of constituents of the γ-secretase complex, presenilin-1 (PS1) and nicastrin, were progressively reduced during aging, resulting in a progressive decrease in γ-secretase enzymatic activity. ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10) and BACE (β-site APP-cleaving enzyme) protein levels exhibited no age-associated regulation, but interestingly, BACE enzymatic activity was increased in aged cells.

VOLUME 281 (2006) PAGES 2405-2413Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 281Issue 18PreviewPAGES 2407-2408: Full-Text PDF Open Access Aging is the most prevailing risk factor of Alzheimer disease, even though the biochemical basis of this association is unknown. A significant pathological feature of Alzheimer disease is the appearance of senile plaques that are composed primarily of amyloid β (Aβ), 2The abbreviations used are: Aβ, amyloid β; APP, amyloid precursor protein; ADAM10, a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10; AICD, APP intracellular domain; APP, amyloid precursor protein; BACE, β-site APP cleaving enzyme; CTF, C-terminal fragment; DRM, detergent-resistant membranes; NHF, normal human fibroblast; PDL, population doubling level; PS1, presenilin-1; sAPP, soluble APP; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; MβCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin. a 38–42-amino-acid peptide derived from proteolytic processing of the ubiquitously expressed amyloid precursor protein (APP) (1Hardy J. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (11025) Google Scholar). At least three APP processing secretases are identified. ADAM10 (α-secretase) is involved in non-amyloidogenic processing and cleaves APP within the Aβ domain, whereby release of Aβ is prevented and soluble sAPPα is secreted (2Lammich S. Kojro E.

Amyloidogenic processing is driven by BACE (β-secretase), which cleaves APP at the N-terminal site of the Aβ domain (3Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B.

Subsequently, a complex of presenilin, nicastrin, anterior pharynx defective-1 and presenilin enhancer-2 (γ-secretase complex) cleaves the generated C-terminal fragments (CTFs) C83 or C99 at the C-terminal site of the Aβ domain (4Francis R.

BACE and the γ-secretase complex have been well described to be associated to detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) or lipid rafts (9Riddell D.R. Christie G. Hussain I. Dingwall C. Curr.

These well structured membrane microdomains exhibit high levels of cholesterol, sphingolipids, and structural protein compounds, such as caveolin (11Simons K. Vaz W.L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2004; 33: 269-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). They function as specialized membrane compartments for channeling and integrating external stimuli into downstream pathways and are also implicated in membrane trafficking (12Stuermer C.A.

Modulation of cellular cholesterol levels has been shown to affect amyloidogenic APP processing by altering the constitution of DRMs and thereby the potential of BACE processing activity (15Simons M.

Although APP processing has been extensively studied in cellular models, the influence of cellular aging on the biochemistry of APP processing has not been investigated in molecular detail so far. Normal human fibroblasts (NHFs) exhibit a well established cellular aging model. In culture, they undergo a limited number of population doubling levels (PDLs) before entering a state of irreversible growth arrest (18Hayflick L. Moorhead P.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1961; 25: 585-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (5527) Google Scholar). At this end-stage of their in vitro mitotic life span, fibroblasts can be maintained and remain metabolically active but cannot be driven into further cell cycling (19Cristofalo V.J. Aging (Milano). 1999; 11: 1-3PubMed Google Scholar). Although the exact molecular mechanisms of this replicative senescence have not been fully understood, multiple age-dependent cellular alterations are described. These include morphological changes with enlarged cell size, dysregulation of protein degradation, as well as post-translational modification of proteins and unresponsiveness to external stimuli (20Campisi J. Dimri G.P. Nehlin J.O. Testori A. Yoshimoto K. Exp. Gerontol. 1996; 31: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 21Cristofalo V.J. Pignolo R.J. Exp. Gerontol. 1996; 31: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined age-associated alterations in the processing of endogenous APP by analyzing intracellular and secreted APP cleavage products throughout the life span of NHFs by immunoblotting as well as pulse-chase analysis. The impact of cholesterol on APP maturation was determined by depletion of intracellular cholesterol levels. We further focused on age-dependent changes in secretase levels, enzymatic activity of BACE, and the γ-secretase complex, as well as the impact of age-related alterations in DRM integrity on proteins involved in APP processing. Cell Line and Culture Conditions—IMR-90 NHFs (Coriell Institute for Medical Research, Camden, NJ) were grown in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with antibiotics (Invitrogen), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), and 10% charcoal-dextran-treated fetal calf serum (HyClone). These deficient culture conditions accelerate aging without influencing the resulting general aged phenotype, as described previously (22Atamna H. Robinson C. Ingersoll R. Elliott H. Ames B.N. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2196-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). At subconfluency, cells were passaged by trypsinization. PDLs were calculated as (log Ch – log Cs)/log (2Lammich S. Kojro E. Postina R. Gilbert S. Pfeiffer R. Jasionowski M. Haass C. Fahrenholz F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3922-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar), where Ch and Cs are defined as the cell number harvested and seeded, respectively. The aged phenotype was identified by use of a senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining kit (Cell Signaling), following the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoblotting—Adherent fibroblasts were scraped off the plates in lysis buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 10% sucrose) sonicated briefly, and boiled for 5 min. Equal amounts of protein were separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using a wet blot chamber (Bio-Rad). Commercial 4–12% NuPage BisTris gels (Invitrogen) were used to simultaneously separate high and low molecular weight proteins. For analysis of secreted APP, the medium was collected after 72 h, and the cells were scraped off the plates, as described above. According to the cell lysate protein concentration, the medium was loaded on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, separated, and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were incubated overnight with the primary antibody at 4 °C. Proteins were detected using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) after incubation for 2 h at room temperature with the appropriate secondary antibody. For detection of BACE, a biotinylated secondary antibody was used. Primary antibodies used were APP C-terminal antibody A8717 (Sigma), APP cytoplasmic domain polyclonal antibody CT-15 (kind gift of Dr. C. U. Pietrzik), APP mid-region polyclonal antiserum 863 (kind gift of Dr. S. Weggen), human APP monoclonal antibody (clone 6E10) (Biocat), actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ADAM10 (Chemicon), BACE (Ab-2) (Oncogene), caveolin-1 (Transduction Laboratories), nicastrin (Sigma), Notch (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PS1 N-terminal (3110), which was raised against a fusion protein of the maltose-binding protein and amino acids 2–80 of human PS1. Quantitative Real-time Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA from cells grown to subconfluency was prepared using the Absolutely RNA reverse transcription-PCR miniprep Kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription was performed on 500 ng of total RNA with the Omniscript reverse transcriptase kit (Qiagen) according to the supplier's instructions. The quantitative real-time PCR was carried out in triplicates containing 1 μl of cDNA, 100 pmol sense and antisense primer (sense, 5′-GGAGCTCCTTCCCGTGAATGG-3′; antisense, 5′-CGTAGCCGTTCTGCTGCATC-3′) and 12.5 μl of 2× SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) in a final volume of 25 μl. PCR was performed using the iCycler (Bio-Rad). PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min, 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 59 °C for 20 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and final elongation at 72 °C for 5 min. The generation of specific PCR products was confirmed by melting curve analysis. The PCR cycle number that generated the first fluorescence signal above threshold (threshold cycle, Ct) was determined. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase served for normalizations and calculation of ΔCt. Metabolic Labeling—IMR-90 cultures were incubated with methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 150 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cystein for 15 min (pulse). Cells were lysed immediately or chased for the indicated time periods. APP and APP-CTFs were immunoprecipitated using the APP-CT antibody 140. This antibody was raised against the C-terminal 20 amino acids of human APP, which were conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin before inoculation in rabbits. Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE. Radiolabeled proteins were detected and quantified by phosphorimaging. Determination of Free Cholesterol—Free unesterified cholesterol species were analyzed using the Amplex Red cholesterol assay kit (Molecular Probes) following the manufacturer's instructions. For determination of the cholesterol content in fractions of sucrose gradients for DRM isolation, 50 μl of each fraction were analyzed. Isolation of Detergent-resistant Membranes—Cells were scraped off the plates in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 300 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm CHAPS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell lysate was mixed with the same volume, 80% sucrose (in lysis buffer without CHAPS). The resulting 40% sucrose solution was overlaid by a step gradient of 1.3 ml of 30% and 0.25 ml of 5% sucrose. By centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C, DRMs floated at the border of 5 and 30% sucrose. Fractions were collected, and 30 μl of each were analyzed by immunoblotting. Determination of β- and γ-Secretase Activity—Enzymatic activities of β- and γ-secretase were analyzed using the β-Secretase Activity assay kit (BioVision) or the γ-Secretase Activity assay kit (R & D Systems), respectively, following the manufacturer's instructions. For analysis of total cellular activity, the same amounts of cellular protein were used. Activity measurements in fractions of sucrose gradients for DRM isolation were done with 50 μl of each fraction. Statistical Analysis—Optical band densities from immunoblotting were measured with Aida Image Analyzer version 3.28 software (Ray-test). Mean values of data from at least three independent experiments were subsequently calculated and plotted as percentage change compared with young cells (PDL 20/23), which have been set to 100%. Standard deviations were calculated by analysis of variance using Sigma Stat software (SPSS Science). Significance was analyzed using the post hoc Tukey test. Levels of Mature APP and APP Cleavage Products Decrease during Cellular Aging—IMR-90 NHFs were sequentially passaged until growth arrest of the cells at PDL46. The aged phenotype was determined using a senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining, which identified almost 100% of stained cells at PDL 46 (data not shown). Processing of endogenous APP throughout the in vitro life span of the NHF culture was analyzed by monitoring the protein levels of full-length APP, the intracellular cleavage products C99, C83, and AICD, as well as the secreted cleavage products sAPP and sAPPα at increasing PDLs by immunoblotting (Fig. 1). We observed ∼50% reduction in the ratio of mature to immature APP in senescent cells (Fig. 1A). Real-time PCR analysis did not show any decrease in APP gene expression (data not shown), and additionally, no significant alterations in immature APP protein levels were detected. Levels of the intracellular APP cleavage products C99 and C83, deriving from either β-or α-secretory cleavage, respectively, significantly decreased from young to old PDLs, resulting in reduced ratios of these C-terminal fragments (CTFs) to total or mature APP. C99 and C83 are further processed by the γ-secretase complex, leading to the generation of AICD. This ∼6-kDa APP-CTF is known to be rapidly degraded and has not been shown at endogenous cellular levels previously. To verify the AICD identity, we treated young fibroblasts (PDL 25) with the γ-secretase inhibitor H-5106 (Sigma), after which the ∼6-kDa band was not detectable anymore (Fig. 1B). In addition, a further APP C-terminal antibody was used, which is well described to be specific for AICD (23Goldgaber D. Lerman M.I. McBride O.W. Saffiotti U. Gajdusek D.C. Science. 1987; 235: 877-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). This antibody also recognized the 6-kDa band, emphasizing the identity of the fragment (supplemental Fig. 1). Thus, we suggest that this APP-derived fragment indeed resembles endogenous AICD. During aging, detectable levels of AICD decreased rapidly, reflecting the progressive decline in C99 as well as C83 generation. Therefore, we conclude that APP processing is gradually reduced throughout the life span of NHFs, resulting in lowered intracellular APP-CTF levels. To further confirm the age-related decline in endogenous APP processing, we analyzed the secreted cleavage products of APP (Fig. 1C). Although secretion of total sAPP and sAPPα decreased, no significant age-associated alteration in the ratio of sAPPα to sAPP was detected. Maturation of APP Is Reduced during Cellular Aging—Interestingly, we observed an age-associated reduction in levels of mature APP as well as APP-CTFs. We next examined the kinetics of APP metabolism by pulse-chase experiments. Analysis of the time course of APP maturation demonstrated a significant delay in generation of mature APP in senescent NHFs (Fig. 2A). Maturation of 50% APP (based on immature APP levels at t = 0 min) was reached after ∼15 min in young cells (PDL 23), whereas ∼24 min were needed in cells at PDL 46. As shown by immunoblotting (Fig. 1A), total levels of mature APP were significantly reduced in aged cells. The half-lives of mature as well as immature APP (∼60 min) did not show an age-associated alteration, suggesting that degradation rates of APP were unchanged during aging. Thus, the reduced levels of mature APP observed in cells at PDL 46, were caused by an age-associated down-regulation in the efficiency of APP maturation, rather than by an enhanced degradation or processing. We also found that APP-CTFs were generated earlier and reached higher levels in young cells as compared with aged cells (Fig. 2B). Together, these data demonstrate that maturation and proteolytic processing of APP is down-regulated during cellular aging. Age-associated Increased Cholesterol Levels Inhibit APP Maturation—We observed a significant reduction in APP maturation efficiency in cells at PDL 46, which resulted in decreased mature APP protein levels. Previously, it was shown that APP maturation is affected by increased cholesterol levels (24Galbete J.L. Martin T.R. Peressini E. Modena P. Bianchi R. Forloni G. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 25Borroni B. Colciaghi F. Lenzi G.L. Caimi L. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. Padovani A. Neurobiol. Aging. 2003; 24: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and analysis of intracellular cholesterol in the NHF aging model detected an age-associated increase by 37% (±4, p = 0.006, n = 3) (data not shown), consistent with a previous study (26Nakamura M. Kondo H. Shimada Y. Waheed A.A. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 290: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To determine whether age-related increased levels of cellular cholesterol affect APP maturation, we depleted cholesterol by treatment with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), exactly as shown previously (27Kojro E. Gimpl G. Lammich S. Marz W. Fahrenholz F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5815-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). After cholesterol depletion, levels of mature APP were selectively increased in aged cells as compared with untreated cells, without any effect on immature APP levels (Fig. 3). This resulted in an increased ratio of mature to immature APP, almost to the level of young cells. Thus, APP maturation was recovered after depletion of cellular cholesterol, demonstrating that the age-associated decreased maturation efficiency of APP was directly affected by increased levels of intracellular cholesterol. Notably, MβCD treatment of young cells did not significantly affect APP maturation. Further, depletion of cholesterol is well described to affect the cleavage of APP, resulting in enhanced non-amyloidogenic processing (27Kojro E. Gimpl G. Lammich S. Marz W. Fahrenholz F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5815-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). However, we observed no significant influence on C83 levels after MβCD treatment. The rather short time of treatment, necessary to avoid the toxic potential of MβCD as well as the slow turnover of APP-CTFs, very likely did not permit resolution of these changes at levels of endogenous APP processing. In addition, analysis of secreted APP cleavage products did not detect differences in APP processing in comparison to untreated cells (data not shown). Age-associated Changes for Constituents of the γ-Secretase Complex—To analyze age-associated alterations in levels of enzymes involved in APP processing, we examined protein levels of ADAM10, BACE, PS1, and nicastrin throughout the life span of NHFs. Immunoblotting detected a selective down-regulation of PS1 and nicastrin, whereas ADAM10 and BACE protein levels were not altered (Fig. 4). Presenilin undergoes endoproteolysis, which results in a C- and N-terminal subunit (28Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitsky T. Davenport F. Nordstedt C. Seeger M. Hardy J. Levey A.I. Gandy S.E. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Protein levels of the PS1 N-terminal subunit as well as of the full-length precursor protein were significantly reduced with increasing PDLs, without any change in the ratio of the PS1 N-terminal subunit to full-length protein. Therefore, cellular aging was not affecting PS1 maturation. Additionally, protein levels of mature nicastrin, another constituent of the γ-secretase complex, were down-regulated throughout the life span of the NHF culture, confirming that total γ-secretase complex levels were reduced during aging. Protein levels of ADAM10 exhibited no age-associated decrease. The inactive proform is cleaved by secretory proprotein convertases generating the active protease (29Anders A. Gilbert S. Garten W. Postina R. Fahrenholz F. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1837-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This maturation process was not exhibiting any changes with increasing PDLs. Also for BACE, no age-dependent alterations in total protein levels and maturation efficiency, mediated by a furin-like convertase (30Bennett B.D. Denis P. Haniu M. Teplow D.B. Kahn S. Louis J.C. Citron M. Vassar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37712-37717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), were detected (see supplemental Fig. 2 for graphical representations of maturation efficiencies). Age-associated decrease in DRM integrity affects the distribution of proteins involved in APP processing—To analyze age-associated alterations in membrane constitution and its influence on proteins involved in APP processing, we isolated DRMs, indicating lipid rafts, by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, as previously described (16Ehehalt R. Keller P. Haass C. Thiele C. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar, 17Abad-Rodriguez J. Ledesma M.D. Craessaerts K. Perga S. Medina M. Delacourte A. Dingwall C. De Strooper B. Dotti C.G. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Thereby, due to their buoyant density, DRMs accumulate between 5 and 30% sucrose (Fig. 5, A and C, fraction 2). Analyzing cholesterol levels within fractions of DRM isolations, we found decreased levels within DRM fractions of aged cells (Fig. 5A), even though total intracellular cholesterol levels were increased, consistent with a previous report (26Nakamura M. Kondo H. Shimada Y. Waheed A.A. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 290: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Furthermore, total caveolin-1 protein levels were progressively up-regulated during cellular aging and, interestingly, caveolin-1 was also observed to significantly migrate into the non-DRM fraction of senescent cells (Fig. 5, B and C, upper panels). To investigate whether this age-dependent disintegration of DRMs or reduction in total DRM levels influenced the localization of APP and its processing secretases, we analyzed their distribution between DRM and non-DRM fractions by immunoblotting (Fig. 5C). In agreement with previous reports, significant levels of BACE, PS1, and also APP were DRM-associated (9Riddell D.R. Christie G. Hussain I. Dingwall C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1288-1293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 10Vetrivel K.S. Cheng H. Lin W. Sakurai T. Li T. Nukina N. Wong P.C. Xu H. Thinakaran G. J. Biol.

Senescent fibroblasts exhibited an altered pattern of distribution. Increased levels of immature APP accumulated within DRMs and significant levels of PS1 migrated into the non-DRM fraction, reflecting the age-associated reduction in DRM integrity or total levels. DRM-associated levels of total BACE were not decreased in senescent cells, but interestingly, mature BACE was almost completely replaced by the immature form, resulting in only marginal levels of DRM-associated mature protease. β-Secretase Enzymatic Activity Is Increased in Aged Cells and Migrates into the Non-DRM Fraction, whereas γ-Secretase Activity Progressively Decreases—Because we observed an age-related down-regulation in the generation of C99 and AICD, we analyzed alterations in enzymatic activity of β- and γ-secretase during cellular aging. β-secretase enzymatic activity was analyzed in total cell lysates and in fractions of DRM isolations. Interestingly, senescent fibroblasts exhibited a significant increase in total BACE activity by 44% in comparison to young and middle-aged cells (Fig. 6A). Within fractions of DRM isolations, β-secretase enzymatic activity was prominently present within DRMs of young cells (PDL 20) but migrated into the non-DRM fraction of cells at PDL 46 (Fig. 6B). Thus, we observed a permanent co-localization of enzymatic activity with the mature form of the enzyme. Analyzing changes in γ-secretase enzymatic activity during aging detected a progressive down-regulation in total enzymatic activity, which reflected the decrease in PS1 N-terminal subunit and nicastrin protein levels and, thus, total γ-secretase levels (Fig. 6C). To analyze whether the age-related reduction in γ-secretase activity exclusively affected APP processing or als"
https://openalex.org/W1988161840,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is a life-threatening human pathogen that is increasingly resistant to a wide array of drugs. Resistance to β-lactams, the most widely used antibiotics, is correlated with tens of amino acid substitutions in their targets; that is, the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), resulting from multiple events of recombination. To discriminate relevant substitutions from those that are incidental to the recombination process, we report the exhaustive characterization of all the mutations in the transpeptidase domain of PBP2x from the highly resistant strain 5204. A semi-automated method combining biochemical and microbiological approaches singled out 6 mutations of 41 (15%) that are essential for high level resistance. The hitherto uncharacterized I371T, R384G, M400T, and N605T together with the previously studied T338M and M339F account for nearly all the loss of affinity of PBP2x for β-lactams. Most interestingly, I371T and R384G cause the conformational change of a loop that borders the entrance of the active site cavity, hampering antibiotic binding. For the first time all the mutations of a PBP relevant to β-lactam resistance have been identified, providing new mechanistic insights. Most notable is the relationship between the decreased susceptibility to β-lactams and the dynamic behavior of a loop.

Most notable is the relationship between the decreased susceptibility to β-lactams and the dynamic behavior of a loop. The discovery of penicillin more than 60 years ago launched the antibiotic era, and β-lactams are still the most widely used drugs to combat bacterial infections today. β-Lactam antibiotics inhibit an essential step in bacterial cell wall synthesis, namely the cross-linking of the peptidoglycan by transpeptidases (TPs). 2The abbreviations used are: TPtranspeptidasePBPpenicillin-binding proteinMICminimal inhibitory concentration. The antibiotics hamper the TP activity by acylating the active site serine of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) enzymes (1Waxman D.J. Strominger J.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 825-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The active site of PBPs is bordered by three defining conserved motifs, SXXK with the catalytic serine, SXN, and KSG. transpeptidase penicillin-binding protein minimal inhibitory concentration. However, several mechanisms have arisen that greatly threaten the clinical efficacy of β-lactams. Depending on the organisms, the strategies vary and can be combined. β-Lactamases can be expressed that degrade the antibiotics. Altered endogenous PBPs or an additional non-susceptible PBP can be expressed. In Gram-negative bacteria, the outer membrane permeability to the drugs can be decreased and/or the drugs can be actively expelled from the periplasm (2Nikaido H. Science. 1994; 264: 382-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar, 3Wilke M.S. Lovering A.L. Strynadka N.C. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major human pathogen of the upper respiratory tract that causes a number of serious life-threatening diseases. It is responsible for non-invasive infections such as otitis media, sinusitis, or pneumonia. Invasive S. pneumoniae infections lead to more severe afflictions like bacteremia or meningitis. In resistant strains altered PBPs are less susceptible to inhibition by antibiotics while remaining physiologically functional (4Hakenbeck R. Kaminski K. Konig A. van der Linden M. Paik J. Reichmann P. Zahner D. Microb. Drug Resist. 1999; 5: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The low susceptibility of PBPs from resistant strains to β-lactam results mainly from a decreased rate of acylation (5Mouz N. Gordon E. Di Guilmi A.M. Petit I. Petillot Y. Dupont Y. Hakenbeck R. Vernet T. Dideberg O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13403-13406Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 6Mouz N. Di Guilmi A.M. Gordon E. Hakenbeck R. Dideberg O. Vernet T. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), although PBPs with both slower acylation and faster deacylation rates are known (8Lu W.P. Kincaid E. Sun Y. Bauer M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31494-31501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). S. pneumoniae contains five high molecular weight PBPs. Mainly three of them are involved in the mechanism of β-lactam resistance: PBP2x, -1a, and -2b. PBP2x and 2b are essential. PBP2x is a primary determinant of β-lactam resistance, because it is the first one modified under selective pressure by some β-lactams (9Grebe T. Hakenbeck R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 829-834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Krauss J. van der Linden M. Grebe T. Hakenbeck R. Microb. Drug Resist. 1996; 2: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Because of its natural competence, S. pneumoniae is able to recombine its genomic DNA with that from other strains or from related species such as Streptococcus mitis or Streptococcus oralis to form mosaic pbp genes (11Dowson C.G. Coffey T.J. Spratt B.G. Trends Microbiol. 1994; 2: 361-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 12Laible G. Spratt B.G. Hakenbeck R. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1993-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Because of this mechanism and additional point mutations, a wide variety of amino acid substitutions (13Asahi Y. Takeuchi Y. Ubukata K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1252-1255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is observed in PBP2x, -1a, and -2b, of which only a restricted set is likely relevant for resistance. Pbp2x sequences of clinical strains can be classified in three groups. Sequences of β-lactam-susceptible strains are similar to that of the susceptible reference laboratory strain R6. The two other groups harbor generally more than 30 mutations in the TP domain and originate from strains with reduced susceptibility to β-lactams (14Chesnel L. Pernot L. Lemaire D. Champelovier D. Croize J. Dideberg O. Vernet T. Zapun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44448-44456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). One group is characterized by the well studied T338A substitution (5Mouz N. Gordon E. Di Guilmi A.M. Petit I. Petillot Y. Dupont Y. Hakenbeck R. Vernet T. Dideberg O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13403-13406Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The other group is composed of sequences containing the Q552E substitution (6Mouz N. Di Guilmi A.M. Gordon E. Hakenbeck R. Dideberg O. Vernet T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19175-19180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The two groups of proteins display reduced reactivity toward β-lactam because of two different mechanisms (5Mouz N. Gordon E. Di Guilmi A.M. Petit I. Petillot Y. Dupont Y. Hakenbeck R. Vernet T. Dideberg O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13403-13406Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 6Mouz N. Di Guilmi A.M. Gordon E. Hakenbeck R. Dideberg O. Vernet T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19175-19180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These mechanisms may sometimes be combined, as a few sequences can harbor mutations at both positions 338 and 552. Four PBP2x mutations that play a role in resistance have been studied in detail. The earlier cited substitution T338A, immediately adjacent to the catalytic Ser-337, and the additional modification at position 339, which further decreases the susceptibility to β-lactams, likely affect the reactivity of the active site serine (5Mouz N. Gordon E. Di Guilmi A.M. Petit I. Petillot Y. Dupont Y. Hakenbeck R. Vernet T. Dideberg O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13403-13406Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); so does T550A, although its effect is restricted to cephalosporins (15Pernot L. Chesnel L. Le Gouellec A. Croize J. Vernet T. Dideberg O. Dessen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16463-16470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Q552E likely influences binding of the antibiotic (6Mouz N. Di Guilmi A.M. Gordon E. Hakenbeck R. Dideberg O. Vernet T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19175-19180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In each case these individual mutations explain only part of the decrease in reactivity toward β-lactams measured for PBP2x from clinical strains and the corresponding resistance. However, there is no clear structure- or alignment-based clue to identify other mutations involved. Identification of all the mutations participating in the resistance process is a crucial step in the development of sequence-based diagnostic tools, in understanding the molecular mechanisms of resistance, and in the future design of better β-lactam antibiotics or adjuvants that might restore susceptibility. We present here an exhaustive study of all the 41 amino acid substitutions located in the TP domain of PBP2x from the highly resistant clinical strain 5204 (penicillin G minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 6.0 μg·ml-1; cefotaxime MIC = 12.0 μg·ml-1; serotype 14) (16Chesnel L. Carapito R. Croize J. Dideberg O. Vernet T. Zapun A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 2895-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The effect of each mutation on the acylation efficiency was investigated. We report five new mutations (I371T, R384G, M400T, D567N, and N605T) affecting the kinetics of reaction with β-lactams in a way that is correlated with resistance phenotypes. Substitutions at positions 371 and 384 affect the resistance by modulating the dynamic behavior of a loop that borders the entrance of the active site. Transformations and MICs—The non-encapsulated S. pneumoniae R6 was used as a recipient strain for genetic transformation. To prevent correction of the introduced mutations by the Hex mismatch repair system of the bacteria, an altered R6 strain (hexA::spc) (17Claverys J.P. Lacks S.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 50: 133-165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used in some cases. The modified strain was obtained by transforming R6 S. pneumoniae with genomic DNA of the R320 strain (generously provided by B. Martin, CNRS, Toulouse) and selection on spectinomycin. Bacteria were grown in C-medium supplemented with 0.18% boiled albumin to an optical density of 0.15 at 620 nm, taken as the onset of the exponential phase. Aliquots withdrawn immediately or after further incubation for 30 min were stored in 20% glycerol at -80 °C until used. About 50 ng of plasmid DNA was added to 100 μl of competent cells (thawed on ice and diluted 10-fold in C-medium with 0.18% boiled albumin). After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C and 120 min at 37 °C, cells were plated on Columbia blood agar base EH (BD Biosciences) plates enriched with 4% defibrinated horse blood containing concentrations of cefotaxime ranging from 0 to 1.5 μg·ml-1. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, isolated colonies were picked and grown overnight in Todd Hewitt medium (Difco) to be stored at -80 °C in 20% glycerol. The MICs were determined using the E-test method on Muller-Hinton agar plates supplemented with 5% sheep blood. Transformants from overnight liquid cultures were plated on agar plates at 0.5 McFarland. E-test strips (AB Biodisk) were laid on the plates, and the MIC was read after an incubation period of 18-24 h. Plasmids and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The expression plasmid pGEX-5204-pbp2x* containing the gene fragment encoding the extracellular domain (residues 49-750, indicated by an asterisk) of PBP2x from the resistant clinical strain 5204 was modified by introducing the replication origin of phage f1 as follows. A NotI/MluI fragment containing the f1 origin was isolated from pGEX-f1-R6-pbp2x* (6Mouz N. Di Guilmi A.M. Gordon E. Hakenbeck R. Dideberg O. Vernet T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19175-19180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and cloned into the pGEX-5204-pbp2x* plasmid. The resulting pGEX-f1-5204-pbp2x* was used for site-directed mutagenesis and protein expression. The previously described pGEX-f1-R6-pbp2x* (6Mouz N. Di Guilmi A.M. Gordon E. Hakenbeck R. Dideberg O. Vernet T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19175-19180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) plasmid was used for site-directed mutagenesis and expression of PBP2x* from strain R6. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by the method of Kunkel et al. (18Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Apart from the preparation of single-stranded dUTP-containing DNA, all steps including transformation and plating were performed on the pipetting robot MicroLab STAR (Hamilton). Because mutagenic primers contained a silent restriction site, the presence of the desired mutation in transformants was checked by PCR of the TP domain coding region and restriction analysis. The insert of all the chosen clones was sequenced and found to be error-free. Protein Expression and Purification—Recombinant PBP2x* from strain R6 and 5204 and all the mutants was expressed as fusion with glutathione S-transferase in MC1061 Escherichia coli. Cells were grown in 25 ml of autoinduction medium (19Studier F.W. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4230) Google Scholar) for 24 h at 37 °C. Pelleted cells were lysed by resuspension in 1 ml of CelLytic B-II (Sigma) containing 90 kilounits of rLysozyme (Novagen) and 25 units of Benzonase (Novagen) for 30 min at room temperature. The supernatant was incubated with 100 μl of glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) on a rotating wheel for 20 min. The resin was washed with 3 ml of 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, 200 mm KCl in a 96-well filter plate (Pall) on the MicroLab STAR robot (Hamilton). Proteins were eluted with 800 μl of 5 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma). For proteins used in the proteolysis assay, the resin was washed with 3 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA and eluted in 300 μl of the same buffer after cleavage with 10 units of thrombin (Sigma). Kinetics—The k2/K acylation parameter was determined directly on the eluates by monitoring the decrease of the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein after the addition of the antibiotic to the proteins in a 96-well black fluotrac-200 plate (Greiner Bio-One) with a Fluostar Optima micro-plate reader (BMG Labtech). The protein concentration was about 0.5 μm, and that of cefotaxime (Sigma) was varied between 5 and 320 μm. The excitation wavelength was 280 nm, and the emission was recorded at 320 nm. At a given concentration of antibiotic, the apparent pseudo-first order rate constant kapp was determined by non-linear least-squares fitting to the equation Fluot = Fluo0 exp(-kapp·t). The efficiency of acylation k2/K was determined by linear regression fitting to the equation kapp = (k2/K)[antibiotic]. Monitoring of Loop 365-394 Dynamics by Proteolysis—Purified PBP2x* variants were subjected to trypsin digestion as follows. About 40 μg of protein were incubated with 80 ng of trypsin (Sigma) in 56 μl at room temperature. At various times aliquots were withdrawn and heated for 10 min at 95 °C in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Aliquots containing about 5 μg of protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide) and Coomassie staining. PBP2x Sequences Comparison—5204-PBP2x has 80 amino acid changes compared with R6-PBP2x, including 41 in the TP domain. There are the two well characterized T338A and M339F substitutions and 39 other previously uncharacterized modifications (between residues 281 and 616, Fig. 1). The TP domain of 5204-PBP2x differs only at 7 positions from that of PBP2x from strain Sp328, the structure of which is known (20Dessen A. Mouz N. Gordon E. Hopkins J. Dideberg O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45106-45112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar); they are F339M, M343T, F364L, A378E, T400M, V572A, and F595Y, where the first amino acid is that from 5204-PBP2x, and the second is from Sp328-PBP2x. The TP domain of 5204-PBP2x differs from that of PBP2x from strain 4790 at positions 339, 343, 378, 400, and 595. 4790-PBP2x has been well characterized previously together with 5204-PBP2x (14Chesnel L. Pernot L. Lemaire D. Champelovier D. Croize J. Dideberg O. Vernet T. Zapun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44448-44456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The results presented below concern both 5204-specific mutations (positions 339 and 400) and substitutions common to the two related Sp328- and 4790-PBP2x sequences. Thus, some of the described phenomena and conclusions certainly apply to a wide class of PBP2x from clinical strains, including strains Sp328 and 4790. Mutagenesis and Protein Production—A large set of mutated PBP2x* was produced to test the influence of substitutions in different contexts. In a first screen, each modified residue of the PBP2x TP domain of strain 5204 was reverted to the original R6-PBP2x amino acid. This strategy was chosen to detect substitutions that may be involved in cooperative effects. With the converse strategy, cooperativity between substitutions would require the introduction of multiple mutations in R6-PBP2x to produce an effect. In a second time, a limited set of pertinent R6-PBP2x point mutants was created to assess the importance of some substitutions in the context of a sequence from a susceptible strain. For in vitro characterization, the modified-PBP2x*s, R6-PBP2x* and 5204-PBP2x*, were expressed in E. coli and purified by glutathione affinity chromatography. The fusion proteins were eluted by competition with reduced glutathione. The homogeneity was assessed by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE. Yields were about 35-40 mg/liter of culture. Screening of Mutations Affecting Acylation Efficiency—The interaction of PBPs with β-lactams can be described by the equation (21Frere J.M. Ghuysen J.M. Iwatsubo M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 57: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), E+I⇄K-1EI→k2EI*→k3E+P(Eq. 1) where E is the enzyme, I is the β-lactam, and P is the inactivated product. First, a noncovalent complex EI is formed (dissociation constant = K) followed by the acylation of the active site Ser-337 by the β-lactam (rate constant = k2). Last, the enzyme is deacylated with the rate constant k3. The efficiency of acylation is characterized by the second-order rate constant k2/K. It was measured at pH 7 by monitoring the decrease of intrinsic fluorescence of the protein upon binding of cefotaxime. Although 5204-PBP2x* is known to have faster deacylation kinetics (higher k3) than R6-PBP2x*, deacylation was negligible under the experimented conditions. The efficiency of acylation by cefotaxime at 37 °C of 5204-PBP2x* and its mutants is presented in Fig. 2. Note that for cases where acylation efficiencies have been published previously, values from the present study are 1.2-2.4-fold lower. This could be due to altered reaction conditions (presence of glutathione) or to the retention of the fusion with the glutathione S-transferase. The substitutions A338T and F339M served as a control for the screening procedure; they cause a considerable 2.1- and 4.9-fold increase of acylation rate, respectively. Of the other 39 substitutions, reversal at 4 positions induced a significant rise of the acylation efficiency. The latter is increased 4-, 2.9-, 1.7-, and 2.5-fold for the T371I, G384R, T400M, and T605N substitutions, respectively. Interestingly, the modification N576D leads to the inverse effect and decreases the k2/K value 4.7-fold. The remaining 34 mutations do not alter substantially the kinetic of the antibiotic binding (values vary between 200 and 480 m-1·s-1). To determine whether substitutions detected in the above-described screen have individual effects in the context of R6-PBP2x*, the k2/K values of the T338A, M339F, I371T, R384G, M400T, D567N, and N605T R6-PBP2x* mutants were measured. Because of the rapid kinetics of R6-PBP2x* and its variants and the long dead time of the measurements in the microplate reader (2 s), the experiments were performed at 28 °C. For direct comparison, the acylation efficiencies of the corresponding A338T, F339M, T371I, G384R, T400M, N567D, and T605N mutants of 5204-PBP2x* were also determined at 28 °C. Moreover, the kinetic analysis was also performed on a set of multiple mutants of R6-PBP2x* and 5204-PBP2x*. Results are presented in Table 1. Among the four new positions (371, 384, 400, and 605) important for the lower reactivity of 5204-PBP2x*, only substitutions at residues 384 and 605 showed a corresponding inverse effect on the acylation of R6-PBP2x*. Both R384G and N605T induced a 27% decrease of the k2/K value in R6-PBP2x*. Because I371T had no influence on the kinetics of R6-PBP2x*, the threonine 371 of strain 5204 is most likely involved in a cooperative action with one or more other substituted amino acids. Surprisingly, M400T changes the efficiency of acylation of R6-PBP2x* in a way opposite to that expected from the effect of the reverse mutant in 5204-PBP2x*; M400T in R6-PBP2x* increases the k2/K value 2.3-fold, whereas the T400M in 5204-PBP2x* also increases the reactivity 3.4-fold.TABLE 1Acylation efficiencies of PBP2x* variants for cefotaxime at 28 °C The reactions were done in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, 200 mm KCl.

These effects are observed for the substitution alone or combined with the six other mutations in R6-PBP2x* or the 5204-PBP2x*. Combination of the six substitutions T338A, F339M, I371T, R384G, M400T, and N605T in R6-PBP2x* decreases the acylation efficiency more than 100-fold so that it remains only 10-fold higher than that of 5204-PBP2x*. Reversion of the six residues at the same positions (A338T, M339F, T371I, G384R, T400M, and T605N) in 5204-PBP2x* causes a near 1000-fold increase of the k2/K value. This hexa-mutant of 5204-PBP2x* is acylated by cefotaxime with an efficiency close to that of R6-PBP2x* (78%). Phenotypes—To assess the phenotypic impact of the newly identified substitutions, the modified 5204- and R6-pbp2x* were transformed into S. pneumoniae R6, and the resistance levels to cefotaxime (MIC) were determined. To avoid masking the effect of mutations in PBP2x by the inhibition of PBP1a (14Chesnel L. Pernot L. Lemaire D. Champelovier D. Croize J. Dideberg O. Vernet T. Zapun A. J. Biol.

The N567D mutation in 5204-PBP2x* had no effect on the MIC. The combinations of F339M/T400M, A338T/F339M, and T371I/G384R reversions induced greater decreases of resistance level with MICs of 0.5, 0.38-0.5, and 0.5 μg·ml-1, respectively. After transformation with the 5204-pbp2x* hexa-mutant A338T/M339F/T371I/G384R/T400M/T605N, sequencing of the gene showed that recombination had occurred between codons 378 and 382. The N-terminal sequence was that of R6-PBP2x, and the C-terminal sequence was that of 5204-PBP2x with the reverted positions 384, 400, and 605. When transforming with the hepta-mutant A338T/M339F/T371I/G384R/T400M/N567D/T605N, the chosen clones had incorporated the region encoding the whole TP domain with the seven reversions. In both cases the susceptibility was slightly reduced to a MIC of cefotaxime of 0.064 μg·ml-1. Apart from the well characterized substitution M339F, which conferred a resistance level of 0.064 μg·ml-1, no single amino acid substitution in R6-PBP2x* induced a resistance level that allowed selection. Clones carrying the double-mutated genes R6-pbp2x*-T338A/M339F and R6-pbp2x*-I371T/R384G showed a resistance level of 0.125 and 0.064 μg·ml-1 of cefotaxime, respectively. Transformation with multiple R6-pbp2x* mutants (R6-pbp2x*-T338A/F339M/I371T/R384G/M400T/N605T and R6-pbp2x*-T338A/F339M/I371T/R384G/M400T/D567N/N605T) produced strains harboring different combinations of mutations. The latter have MICs ranging from 0.19 to 0.5 μg·ml-1. No clone with all the six or seven described mutations could be isolated, suggesting that a combination of all the substitutions is lethal to the bacteria. The clones carrying mutations at positions 338, 339, 371, 384, and 605 have the highest observed MIC (0.5 μg·ml-1) among strains carrying R6-pbp2x* variants; they are only half as resistant as those containing the entire coding region of the PBP2x TP domain of strain 5204. Overall, the transformation results demonstrate that the effect on the efficiency of acylation of PBP2x is correlated with the resistance conferred. Monitoring of Loop 365-394 Dynamics by Proteolysis—Two of the four newly found resistance-related amino acid positions (371 and 384) are located in a region that is flexible in the related Sp328-PBP2x* (4Hakenbeck R. Kaminski K. Konig A. van der Linden M. Paik J. Reichmann P. Zahner D. Microb. Drug Resist. 1999; 5: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It consists of a loop region between residues 365 and 394, which is not traceable on the crystal structure of Sp328-PBP2x* because of a very weak electron density (20Dessen A. Mouz N. Gordon E. Hopkins J. Dideberg O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45106-45112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This loop is not mobile in R6-PBP2x (21Frere J.M. Ghuysen J.M.

https://openalex.org/W2030318822,"Bcl-x exists in two isoforms, the anti-apoptotic form Bcl-xL and the proapoptotic form Bcl-xS. The critical balance between the two forms appears to be important for cell survival; however, it is still not clear exactly how the vital balance is maintained. Using an in vitro spermatogenic cell apoptosis model, this study provides a new insight into the possible role of Ca2+ in regulating the Bcl-xS and Bcl-xL expression. 2,5-Hexanedione, a metabolite of the common industrial solvent n-hexane, caused a significant increase in reactive oxygen species followed by an enhancement of intracellular Ca2+ through the T-type Ca2+ channels. Consequent to the above changes, expression of Bcl-xS increased with a concomitant drop in Bcl-xL expression, thus altering the ratio of the two proteins. Impediment of Ca2+ influx by using a T-type Ca2+ channel blocker pimozide resulted in a decrease in Bcl-xS and an increase in Bcl-xL expression. This caused prevention of mitochondrial potential loss, reduction of caspase-3 activity, inhibition of DNA fragmentation, and increase in cell survival. Alternatively, Ca2+ ionophores caused an increase of Bcl-xS encoding isoform over the Bcl-xL-encoding isoform. Therefore, this study proposes a role for Ca2+ in regulation of Bcl-xS and Bcl-xL expression and ultimately cell fate.

The testis produces mature gametes through the complex process of spermatogenesis that involves stem spermatogonial commitment to proliferation and differentiation, modulated by a network of endocrine and paracrine regulatory signals (1Holdcraft R.W. Braun R.E. Int. J. Androl. 2004; 27: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To maintain testicular homeostasis, very active prosurvival and proapoptotic systems work together to regulate the extent of spermatogenic cell apoptosis in the quest for producing a constant supply of high quality male gametes. The study of mechanisms of spermatogenic cell apoptosis has attracted considerable attention in recent years because of the awareness that environmental agents interfere with spermatogenesis (2Akingbemi B.T. Hardy M.P. Ann. Med. 2001; 33: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 3Boekelheide K. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. Monogr. 2005; 34: 6-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Although Fas/FasL are strongly implicated in spermatogenic cell death during development (4Sinha Hikim A.P. Lue Y. Diaz-Romero M. Yen P.H. Wang C. Swerdloff R.S. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 85: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), adulthood (4Sinha Hikim A.P. Lue Y. Diaz-Romero M. Yen P.H. Wang C. Swerdloff R.S. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), Bcl-2 family members are reported to have an important role during testicular development (7Yan W. Suominen J. Samson M. Jegou B. Toppari J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 165: 115-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), their function during toxin induced apoptosis in the testis remaining elusive. The members of the Bcl-2 family composed of both death agonists and antagonists differ in their structural features, and their expression pattern depends on the tissue of expression and activators of expression (8Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). One characteristic feature of this family is their propensity to form homodimers and heterodimers between themselves or other members of the same family (8Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). A homologue of Bcl-2, Bcl-x, exists in two isoforms generated by alternative splicing. The large form, Bcl-xL, protects cells against death, whereas the short form, Bcl-xS, promotes cell death by inhibiting Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL function. It is generally believed that the ratio of death antagonists, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, and death agonists, such as Bax and Bcl-xS, play a major role in the fate of the cell following an apoptotic stimulus (9Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5865) Google Scholar). Bcl-xS is important during apoptosis in some systems like cardiomyocytes (10Rohrbach S. Muller-Werdan U. Werdan K. Koch S. Gellerich N.F. Holtz J. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2005; 38: 485-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), human hepatocellular carcinoma (11Chiu C.T. Yeh T.S. Hsu J.C. Chen M.F. Dig. Dis. Sci. 2003; 48: 670-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and acute myeloid leukemic cells (12Yamaguchi H. Inokuchi K. Dan K. Leuk. Res. 2002; 26: 1119-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar); however, the role of Bcl-xS in spermatogenic cell apoptosis is not known. The ratio of Bcl-xS to Bcl-xL appears to be instrumental in deciding cell fate in a number of cell types (10Rohrbach S. Muller-Werdan U. Werdan K. Koch S. Gellerich N.F. Holtz J. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2005; 38: 485-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 13Pecci A. Scholz A. Pelster D. Beato M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11791-11798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Interestingly, changes in Ca2+ homeostasis is intimately connected to the functioning of Bcl-2 family of proteins. This has profound implications in terms of cellular functioning because Ca2+ is a ubiquitous second messenger controlling a broad range of cellular functions including growth and proliferation. Bcl-2 proteins partially deplete the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ store, and this alteration reduces cellular sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli (14Chami M. Prandini A. Campanella M. Pinton P. Szabadkai G. Reed J.C. Rizzuto R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54581-54589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In contrast to the role of Bcl-2 in regulating Ca2+,Ca2+ increase induced by tumor necrosis factor α has been shown to suppress Bcl-2 expression (15Kim B.C. Kim H.T. Mamura M. Ambudkar I.S. Choi K.S. Kim S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31381-31389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) showing a regulatory effect of Ca2+ on the expression of Bcl-2. Another prosurvival member, Bcl-xL, is known to affect Ca2+ homeostasis by altering expression of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors (16Li C. Fox C.J. Master S.R. Bindokas V.P. Chodosh L.A. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9830-9835Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Further evidence for the involvement of the Bcl-2 family of proteins and Ca2+ comes from studies with the calcium ionophore ionomycin, which inhibits growth of human bladder cancer cells with alterations of Bcl-2 and Bax expression levels (17Miyake H. Hara I. Yamanaka K. Arakawa S. Kamidono S. J. Urol. 1999; 162: 916-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The relationship between Bcl-xL and Bcl-xS with Ca2+ has not been established in any cell type possibly because of the lack of a suitable model system that involves Bcl-xS and Bcl-xL as well as Ca2+. Although developmental apoptosis has been well studied in the testis and Bcl-2 proteins have been implicated in spermatogenesis, the biochemical pathways involved are not fully understood. In particular, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms regulating the Bcl-xL and Bcl-xS and the outcome of alterations of these proteins in spermatogenic cells. A few reports about testicular Bcl-xL show that down-regulation of the gene after octylphenol exposure leads to cell death (18Kim S.K. Lee H.J. Yang H. Kim H.S. Yoon Y.D. Arch. Androl. 2004; 50: 427-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), severe defects in male germ cells during development in Bcl-x knock-out heterozygous mice (19Kasai S. Chuma S. Motoyama N. Nakatsuji N. Dev. Biol. 2003; 264: 202-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and reduction of Bcl-xL expression by anti-androgens, resulting in increased cell death (20Woolveridge I. Taylor M.F. Wu F.C. Morris I.D. Prostate. 1998; 36: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). An obstacle in studying the involvement of these proteins in spermatogenic cells in vivo is the inability to create a “spermatogenic cell” only model, and therefore it is impossible to delineate any possible independent action of a death-inducing agent on these cells because of their association with other testicular somatic members. The presence of active proapoptotic and prosurvival systems in spermatogenic cells provides an opportunity to look at spermatogenic cell death in various death induction models. Previous studies from this laboratory on spermatogenic cell apoptosis using in vitro and in vivo models showed the involvement of the Fas/FasL pathway in estrogen-induced cell death (21Mishra D.P. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6181-6196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 22Nair R. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6470-6481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In this study, we have employed a well known testicular toxin 2,5-hexanedione (2,5-HD), 2The abbreviations used are: 2,5-HD, 2,5-hexanedione; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase enzyme-mediated dUTP nick end labeling; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; ROS, Reactive oxygen species; CM-H2DCFDA, 6-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate di(acetoxymethyl ester); JC-1, 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-l,1′,3,3′-tetraethyl benzimidazole carbocyanide iodide; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; FMK, fluoromethylketone; AMC, 7-amino-4-methyl coumarin. which is a metabolite of the common industrial solvents n-hexane and methyl n-butyl ketone. Chronic exposure to 2,5-HD induces peripheral polyneuropathy and testicular injury (23Boekelheide K. Fleming S.L. Allio T. Embree-Ku M.E. Hall S.J. Johnson K.J. Kwon E.J. Patel S.R. Rasoulpour R.J. Schoenfeld H.A. Thompson S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 125-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Using this toxin to induce spermatogenic cell apoptosis, we provide a new insight of a close relationship between Bcl-xS and Bcl-xL with intracellular Ca2+, where we demonstrate that increased intracellular Ca2+ caused by exposure to 2,5-HD results in a shift toward a relative increase of Bcl-xS encoding isoform over the Bcl-xL isoform. Because the level of Bcl-2 and Bax remained unchanged after 2,5-HD exposure, our results suggest that the effect of 2,5-HD is mediated by reversal of the ratio between apoptosis-inducing and -preventing isoforms of Bcl-x. The apparent regulation of both Bcl-xS and Bcl-xL expression by increased Ca2+ induced by either 2,5-HD exposure or Ca2+ ionophores sheds a new light on the possible regulation of these molecules in the face of ionic changes. 2,5-HD was purchased from Aldrich.

Spermatogenic cell cultures (106 cells ml-1) in Ham's F-12 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (supplemented with 14.2 mm sodium bicarbonate, 10 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10-7 m testosterone, and 1% bovine serum albumin) were treated with 5 μm 2,5-HD. Vehicle for control was the medium in which 2,5-HD was dissolved. For experiments with Ca2+ channel blockers, the cells were preincubated for 30 min with the following blockers: nifedipine (10 μm), verapamil (20 μm), pimozide (20 μm), bepridil (50 μm), and benzamil (25 μm), prior to exposure of the cells to 2,5-HD.

Briefly, decapsulated rat testes were finely chopped in spermatogenic cell culture medium and Ham's F-12 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and the cells were subjected to serial filtration through Nitex mesh (1000 and 20 μm), Miracloth, and glass wool. The resultant suspension was centrifuged and resuspended in Ham's F-12 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and flow cytometry was used to check the composition of the cell preparation as described earlier (21Mishra D.P.

Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase Enzyme-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL)—Detection of DNA fragmentation was carried out using a TUNEL assay kit as described previously (21Mishra D.P. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6181-6196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Formaldehyde (4%) fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature followed by incubation with buffer containing nucleotide mix (50 μm fluorescein-12-dUTP, 100 μm dATP, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.6) for 1 h at 37°C. Propidium iodide staining at 1 μg ml-1 was used for measurement of cell viability. Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-labeled and propidium iodide-labeled cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Annexin Labeling—For visualization of annexin-V labeling, the procedure was carried out as per the manufacturer's instructions using a Vybrant apoptosis assay kit. Briefly, the cells after the respective treatments were washed with ice-cold phosphate buffer and suspended in annexin-V binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, 700 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) and incubated for 15 min with annexin-V conjugated to Alexa fluor. Subsequently, the cells were washed and resuspended in the binding buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry. Flow Cytometry and Microscopy—Cells (106 cells ml-1) from different experimental groups were run on a BD-LSR flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) equipped with a 20-mV, 488 nm air-cooled argon ion laser and analyzed as described previously (21Mishra D.P. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6181-6196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). All of the signals were detected using the following settings: for fluorescence 1 (green), a 530/28 band pass filter was used, and fluorescence was measured in the log mode; and for fluorescence 3 (red), a 575/26 band pass filter was used, and fluorescence was measured in the log mode. The analyses were performed on 100,000 gated events, and the numeric data were processed using WinMDI shareware. All of the plots are representative of three or four experiments. After different treatments, the cells were visualized under a Nikon inverted TE-2000 microscope, and the images were captured with a CCD cooled digital camera (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD) using a Image Pro Plus® version 5.0 software (Media Cybernetics). Filter blocks used for fluorescence were comprised of a blue filter with excitation at 450–490 nm. Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was measured using JC-1 probe as described previously (21Mishra D.P. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6181-6196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 22Nair R. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6470-6481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were labeled with JC-1 (10 μm), a cationic mitochondrial vital dye at 37 °C for 10 min, and the changes in fluorescence were monitored at two different wave-lengths as mentioned above. The ratio of the reading at 590 nm to the reading at 530 nm (590:530 ratio) was considered as the relative ΔΨm value. To monitor the level of ROS, the cell-permeant probe CM-H2DCFDA was used as described previously (21Mishra D.P. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6181-6196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). 107 cells were incubated with 2 μg ml-1 CM-H2DCFDA for 15 min in the dark; subsequently, treatments were carried out, and fluorescence was monitored at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wave-length of 530 nm. For each experiment, fluorometric measurements were performed in triplicate and expressed as fluorescence intensity units. All of the measurements were carried out in a FluostarOptima Spectrofluorometer (BMG Technologies, Offenburg, Germany). Changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration were monitored with the fluorescent probe fluo-3AM as described previously (21Mishra D.P. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6181-6196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were loaded for 30 min at 25 °C with 5 μm fluo-3AM containing 1 μm pluronic acid F-127 for proper dispersal and 0.25 mm sulfinpyrazone, an organic anion transport inhibitor to reduce leakage of the fluo-3 dye. Just before use, the cells were washed with medium to remove nonhydrolyzed fluo-3AM. Fluorescence measurements were performed at an excitation of 488 nm and an emission of 522 nm. To convert fluorescence values into absolute [Ca2+]i, calibration was performed at the end of each experiment. [Ca2+]i was calculated using the equation [Ca2+]i = Kd (F - Fmin)/(Fmax - F), where Kd is the dissociation constant of the Ca2+-fluo-3 complex (400 nm), and F represents the fluorescence intensity of the cells. Fmax represents the maximum fluorescence (obtained by treating cells with 10 μm calcium ionophore A23187), and Fmin corresponds to the minimum fluorescence (obtained from ionophore-treated cells in the presence of 3 mm EGTA). The fluorescence intensities were expressed as the increase in fluorescence with respect to base-line fluorescence intensity before stimulation. ATP was measured by a bioluminescence assay using an ATP determination kit as described previously (22Nair R. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6470-6481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells (106 cells ml-1) after different treatments were resuspended in reaction buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm luciferin, and 12.5 μg ml-1 luciferase and gently mixed, after which readings were taken in a Fluostar Optima multilabel detection system (BMG Technologies). ATP standard curves were run in all experiments with different concentrations of ATP, and calculations were made against the curve. Cellular ATP levels were expressed as n mol/107 cells. Preparation of Cell Cytosol and Total Cell Lysate—Briefly, 108 spermatogenic cells were suspended in a buffer containing 150 mm sucrose, 10 mm succinate, 5 mm potassium phosphate, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors (benzamidine HCl, 1.6 mg/ml; phenanthroline, 1 mg/ml; aprotinin, 1 mg/ml; leupeptin, 1 mg/ml; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm) and lysed by nitrogen cavitation (450 p.s.i. for 30 min at 4 °C) with constant stirring. The lysate was centrifuged sequentially at 500 and 2,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove unbroken cells and nuclei, respectively. The supernatant obtained was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°Cin a Optima™ XL-100K ultracentrifuge (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA) to obtain cell cytosol. For total cell lysate, the cells were mixed with lysis buffer (0.125 m Tris, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 10% 2-mercaptoethanol), and after heating, the lysate was centrifuged. The supernatants were analyzed on gels. Analysis of Proteins—Proteins in the supernatant were separated by electrophoresis on 10–12% polyacrylamide gels and transferred on to nitrocellulose, and Western blot analysis was carried out as described previously (21Mishra D.P. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6181-6196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 22Nair R. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6470-6481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). All of the primary antibodies were diluted to 1:1000 or 1:1500, and secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase at 1:5000 dilution were used. The reactive bands were visualized by using either a Vector immunoperoxidase substrate kit or a ECL Western blotting detection kit. Densitometric measurements of Western blots were carried out using a Ultraviolet Products gel documentation system (Upland, CA). Cells (106 cells ml-1) from the control and experimental groups were mixed with 55 μl of Triton X-100 lysis buffer containing 0.5 m EDTA, 1 m Tris-HCl, pH. 8.0, 0.5% Triton X-100 and incubated on ice for 20 min and subsequently centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was extracted with 1:1 mixture of phenol:chloroform and precipitated in cold ethanol and sodium acetate. After RNase treatment, to each sample 5 μl of loading buffer was added and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The samples were analyzed on an agarose (1.2%) gel. Caspase-3 activity in the cells was determined as per the manufacturer's instructions using an EnzChek® caspase-3 assay kit (Molecular Probes). Briefly, the cells (106 cells ml-1) after the respective treatments were washed with ice-cold phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), and the cell pellets were lysed in cell lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.001% Triton X-100). Subsequently, after centrifugation, the supernatants from each sample were mixed with Z-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-AMC substrate solution. A standard curve of AMC ranging from 0 to 100 μm was run with each set of samples. Control without enzyme was used in each assay to determine the background fluorescence of the substrate. As an additional control to some selected samples, 1 μl of the 1 mm Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-CHO (aldehyde), the caspase-3 inhibitor stock solution, was added. Fluorescence was measured at an excitation wave-length of 342 nm and an emission wavelength of 441 nm in a Fluostar Optima spectrofluorometer (BMG Technologies). Total RNA was isolated from treated and untreated cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). About 2 μg of total RNA was used to synthesize cDNA, and 5% of these were used in PCR. Oligo(dT)18 primers (0.5 μg/μl), dNTP, and SuperScript II reverse transcription (Invitrogen) were used for cDNA synthesis reaction. The specific primers are as follows: Bcl-xL (sense), 5′-GTAAACTGGGGTCGCATTGT-3′; Bcl-xL (antisense), 5′-TGGATCCAAGGCTCTAGGTG-3′; Bcl-xS, (sense), 5′-CAGGGACAGCATATCAGAGC-3′; Bcl-xS (antisense), 5′-CAGGGACCAGCGGTTGAAG-3′; β-actin (sense), 5′-GACAGCAGTCGGTTGGACC-3′; and β-actin (antisense), 5′-CAGGTAAGCCCTGGCTGC-3′. A cycle profile consisted of 2 min at 94 °C, followed by 30 s at 94 °C for denaturation, 30 s at 60 °C for annealing, and 30 s at 72 °C for extension for Bcl-xL and β-actin. For Bcl-xS, the annealing temperature was 58 °C. All of the PCR amplification reactions were carried out for 30 cycles each. For visualization, the resulting PCR products were resolved on 1.2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Cells (107) from the control and experimental groups were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Subsequently, the cells were washed two times in phosphate-buffered saline and blocked in 3% normal goat serum containing 0.1% saponin at room temperature for 30 min. The cells were then incubated with the primary antibody at the concentration of 1:100 for 1 h at 37 °C followed by secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa fluor at a concentration of 1:100 for 1 h at 37 °C. Subsequently the cells were washed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline for flow cytometry. Paired comparisons were conducted using a paired t test, and all of the data are presented as the means ± S.E. The differences were considered significant at a 0.05 level of confidence. 2,5-HD Induces Apoptosis of Spermatogenic Cells in Vitro—Previous studies describe exposure to 2,5-HD as an apoptosis-inducing event in spermatogenic cells (3Boekelheide K. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. Monogr. 2005; 34: 6-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To investigate death pathways associated with 2,5-HD exposure, we used an in vitro spermatogenic cell culture system (21Mishra D.P. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6181-6196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) consisting of both spermatocytes and spermatids, the spermatids being the most abundant cells that exist in intimate association with the spermatocytes within the seminiferous epithelium. Fig. 1A shows the cell preparation used for the study as described previously (21Mishra D.P. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6181-6196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 22Nair R. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6470-6481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Exposure to 2,5-HD caused cell death over a period of 10 h with about 50% cells dying by 8 h as measured by propidium iodide staining (Fig. 1B). To identify whether this death occurred through the apoptotic pathway, several biochemical tests were carried out. Genomic DNA prepared from spermatogenic cells after 10 h of exposure showed a clear DNA ladder, a hallmark of apoptosis (25Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6273) Google Scholar), in the 2,5-HD treated group (Fig. 1C, lane b), whereas genomic DNA from control cells did not show such a feature (Fig. 1C, lane a). Initiation of DNA fragmentation was evident earlier around 6 h after toxin treatment that was visible as TUNEL-positive cells. Fragmented ends of DNA were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate-tagged dUTP, and flow cytometric measurements showed a distinct shift in about 65% of cells at 6 h (Fig. 1D). Apoptosis was also identifiable by the ability of the apoptotic cells to bind to annexin-V. This is because cells undergoing apoptosis exhibit disorganization of the plasma membrane, followed by the externalization of certain phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine (26Schlegel R.A. Callahan M.K. Williamson P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 926: 217-2"
https://openalex.org/W2024430147,"Rac activation is a key step in chemotaxis of hematopoietic cells, which is both positively and negatively regulated by receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins. P-Rex1, a Rac-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, is dually activated by phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) and the Gβγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. This study explored the regulation of P-Rex1 by phosphorylation with the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A) in vitro and by Gi- and Gs-coupled receptors in HEK293T cells. P-Rex1 isolated from Sf9 and HEK293T cells migrates as two distinct bands that are partially phosphorylated. Phosphorylation of P-Rex1 with protein kinase A (PKA) inhibits the PIP3- and Gβγ-stimulated P-Rex1 guanine nucleotide exchange activity on Rac. The guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity of three different forms of P-Rex1 (native Sf9, de-phosphorylated, and phosphorylated) was examined in the presence of PIP3 and varying concentrations of Gβ1γ2. Gβ1γ2 was 47-fold less potent in activating the phosphorylated form of P-Rex1 compared with the de-phosphorylated form. HEK293T cells expressing P-Rex1 were labeled with 32P and stimulated with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) to release Gβγ or isoproterenol to activate PKA. Treatment with isoproterenol or Sp-cAMPS, a potent activator of PKA, increased the incorporation of 32P into P-Rex1. LPA increased the amount of GTP-bound Rac in the cells and isoproterenol reduced basal levels of GTP-bound Rac and blunted the effect of LPA. Treatment of the cells with Sp-cAMPS also reduced the levels of GTP-bound Rac. These results outline a novel mechanism for Gs-linked receptors to regulate the function of P-Rex1 and inhibit its function in cells.

Like the P-Rex family of GEFs, all GEFs are multimodular proteins containing at least the DH/PH tandem domain and various other functional domains, such as SH2, SH3, Ser/Thr, or tyrosine kinase, Ras-GEF, Rho-GAP, Ran-GEF, PDZ and/or additional PH domains (6Schmidt A.

Their structural complexity allows for a number of distinct modes of regulation although no universal mode of GEF regulation exists. Thus far, at least five different modes of regulation have been identified for the known proteins exhibiting GEF activity: (a) regulation by localization; (b) regulation by intramolecular interactions; (c) regulation by phosphoinositol kinases; (d) activation by α and βγ subunits of GTP-binding proteins; and (e) activation by protein kinases (6Schmidt A.

There have only been a limited number of studies published on the activity and regulation of the three P-Rex family members.

Using targeted deletions, they found that P-Rex1 mutants lacking the PH domain (ΔPH) could not be stimulated by PIP3, demonstrating that the PH domain is required for PIP3-dependent activation of P-Rex1 (5Hill K.

Moreover, the ΔPH mutant was 10 times more active than the wild-type P-Rex1, suggesting that the PH domain plays an inhibitory role in the wild-type P-Rex1 molecule (5Hill K. Krugmann S. Andrews S.R.

Similarly, the P-Rex1 mutant containing only the isolated DH/PH tandem of P-Rex1 was highly active compared with wild-type P-Rex1. These findings suggest that the PH domain along with the other domains in wild-type P-Rex1 are responsible for the intramolecular regulation of basal P-Rex1 activity (5Hill K. Krugmann S.

In hematopoietic cells, where P-Rex1 is highly expressed, Gi-coupled receptors, such as the fMet-Leu-Phe receptor, and Gs-coupled receptors, such as the adenosine A2a receptor, have been shown to stimulate and inhibit chemotaxis, respectively (9Baggiolini M.

Because Rac activation is a key step in hematopoietic cell chemotaxis and P-Rex1 plays a major role in Rac activation, the regulation of P-Rex1 by multiple G protein α subunits (17Mayeenuddin L.H.

Purification of Rac1 and PAK1 PBD-GST Fusion Proteins from Bacteria—The method used to purify GST-Rac1 has been described (17Mayeenuddin L.H. McIntire W.E. Garrison J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1913-1920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The human PAK1 (p21-activated kinase 1) protein contains a PBD that binds activated Cdc42 or Rac with high affinity (32Benard V. Bokoch G.M. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 345: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The recombinant PAK1 PBD-binding domain with an N-terminal GST tag was purified using a GST resin (Amersham Biosciences). Two liters of DH5α bacterial culture expressing the GST-tagged PAK1 PBD construct were harvested and lysed using a French Press in 30 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and protease inhibitors (aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin (at 2 μg/ml), benzamidine at 20 μg/ml, and Pefabloc SC Plus at 100 μg/ml). One percent Triton X-100 was added to the cell lysate and the mixture incubated on ice for 30 min. The cell lysate was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (30 ml) was collected and incubated with 1 ml of GST resin for 2 h at 4°C with constant agitation. After the incubation, the GST-Sepharose beads were pelleted at 2000 rpm for 2 min. The beads were washed five times and pelleted at 2000 rpm for 2–3 min after each wash. The resin was washed twice with 15 ml of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm DTT and protease inhibitors) and 1% Triton X-100. The beads were subsequently washed three more times with 15 ml of buffer B. The beads were then aliquoted and stored in buffer B containing 50% (v/v) glycerol at –80 °C. Purification of λ-PPase—The recombinant MBP-tagged λ-PPase was purified using an amylose resin. One liter of BL21 bacterial cell culture expressing λ-PPase was harvested by centrifugation and lysed using a French press in 30 ml of MBP column buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 40 units/μl DNase I, and protease inhibitors. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (30 ml) was collected and incubated with ∼3 ml of amylose resin for 2 h at 4°C with constant rocking. After the incubation, the resin was centrifuged at 600 × g for 2–3 min and the supernatant was removed. The resin was poured into a column and washed with 40 ml of MBP buffer and allowed to drain by gravity flow. The protein was eluted off the column in 2-ml fractions using MBP buffer containing 10 mm maltose. Column fractions (4 ml) containing λ-PPase were pooled and dialyzed against two changes of 2 liters of storage buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.01% Brij 35. The purified protein was then dialyzed again overnight against 1 liter of storage buffer containing 50% glycerol. The dialyzed protein was resolved on an 8% SDS-PAGE to determine the purity and quantity of the λ-PPase by visualizing with Coomassie Blue. The MBP-tagged λ-PPase prepared using this protocol was highly pure and migrated as a single major band at ∼56 kDa. Approximately, 1 ml of 3 mg/ml of λ-PPase was obtained from 1 liter of BL21 bacterial culture. Preparation of λ-PPase-treated and PKA-treated P-Rex1—We used two different protocols to de-phosphorylate and phosphorylate P-Rex1. Initial experiments used the purified P-Rex1 protein doublet from Sf9 cells that was batch phosphorylated or de-phosphorylated on a small scale (10–50 μl) and then used directly for P-Rex1 activity assays. Using these small scale assays, we optimized the conditions for P-Rex1 dephosphorylation and phosphorylation (see Fig. 2). Small scale de-phosphorylation reactions using λ-PPase were carried out for 10 min at 30 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.01% Brij 35 (v/v), and 2 mm MnCl2. The ability of various concentrations of the λ-PPase to de-phosphorylate P-Rex1 was tested on 80 ng/μl P-Rex1 in a 50-μl reaction volume. The reactions were terminated using either a final concentration of 2–4 mm sodium orthovanadate (33Zhuo S. Clemens J.C. Hakes D.J. Barford D. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17754-17761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or 25 μl of 2 × Laemmli sample buffer. Control reactions were carried out in the absence of the λ-PPase and the reactions were supplemented with the appropriate λ-PPase storage buffer. To test the P-Rex1 activity of de-phosphorylated P-Rex1, the reactions were terminated with sodium orthovanadate, placed on ice, and assayed for activity as described under “P-Rex1 Activity Assay.” Unless otherwise specified, λ-PPase-treated P-Rex1 was diluted 10-fold into the P-Rex1 activity assay to achieve a final P-Rex1 concentration of 30 nm (Fig. 1).FIGURE 1PKA can phosphorylate pure P-Rex1. P-Rex1 (500 ng) was incubated with 50 units of PKA and the reactions were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Aliquots containing about 100 ng of P-Rex1 were run on an 8% SDS-PAGE, stained with silver, dried, and the autoradiograph prepared.

The Rac guanine nucleotide exchange assays to monitor P-Rex1 GEF activity were carried out on de-phosphorylated and phosphorylated P-Rex1, as described under “Experimental Procedures” in a 10-μl volume in the presence of 0.0025% CHAPS.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Small scale PKA phosphorylation reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 30 min, in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 200 nm microcystin, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 12.5 mm magnesium acetate, 1.25 mm EGTA. The total reaction volume was 10 μl and the protein to kinase ratio was 10 ng of P-Rex1:1 unit of PKA. The reactions were initiated by the addition of ATP at a final concentration of 125 μm. The reactions were terminated by the addition of the PKA inhibitor peptide (PKI residues 5–24) to a final concentration of 100 nm or by addition of 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Control reactions were carried out in the absence of the kinase, and the reactions were supplemented with the appropriate kinase storage buffers. The PKA storage buffer contained 350 mm KPO4 and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The PKA enzyme was stored in small aliquots and used only once. To test the P-Rex1 activity of phosphorylated P-Rex1, the reactions were terminated with the above peptide inhibitor, placed on ice, and diluted 10-fold into the assay, and P-Rex1 activity was determined as above (Fig. 1). Reactions to determine the concentration of PKA needed for effective phosphorylation of P-Rex1 were carried out as above with varying concentrations of PKA in the presence of 600 ng of P-Rex1 in a volume of 10 μl for 5 min at 30 °C. Radiolabeled phosphorylation reactions were carried out as described above with the addition of [γ-32P]ATP (2.2 × 107 cpm/μl, final). Once the de-phosphorylation and phosphorylation protocols for P-Rex1 were optimized, large scale purifications of de-phosphorylated and phosphorylated P-Rex1 were undertaken using treatment of P-Rex1 on the EE-antibody column with λ-PPase and/or PKA. Purification of de-phosphorylated and phosphorylated P-Rex1 from the column allows isolation of highly pure P-Rex1 free of the λ-PPase or PKA, as these enzymes are washed away before elution of P-Rex1 from the column.

We have used both kinetic and binding assays for comparative analysis of UNG enzymes from humans and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). Steady-state fluorescence assays showed that hUNG has a much higher specificity constant (kcat/Km) compared with the viral enzyme due to a lower Km. The binding of UNG to DNA was also studied using a catalytically inactive mutant of UNG and non-cleavable substrate analogs (2′-deoxypseudouridine and 2′-α-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine). Equilibrium DNA binding revealed that both human and HSV-1 UNG enzymes bind to abasic DNA and both substrate analogs more weakly than to uracil-containing DNA. Structure determination of HSV-1 D88N/H210N UNG in complex with uracil revealed detailed information on substrate binding. Together, these results suggest that a significant proportion of the binding energy is provided by specific interactions with the target uracil. The kinetic parameters for human UNG indicate that it is likely to have activity against both U·A and U·G mismatches in vivo. Weak binding to abasic DNA also suggests that UNG activity is unlikely to be coupled to the subsequent common steps of base excision repair.

Uracil can arise in DNA either by the misincorporation of dUTP during DNA synthesis, which results in a U·A base pair, or by the spontaneous deamination of cytosine. Approximately 100 cytosine deamination events cell-1 day-1 are expected in human cells (1Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4299) Google Scholar), producing a promutagenic U·G mismatch in DNA. If unrepaired, this will lead to an A·T transition mutation following DNA replication. UNG is one of the initiating DNA glycosylases of the base excision repair pathway and is responsible for the specific recognition and removal of uracil. It removes uracil by cleavage of the N-glycosidic bond between the uracil and the deoxyribose backbone, leaving an apyrimidinic (AP) site (2Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3649-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). AP sites are themselves highly mutagenic and are further repaired by the common downstream enzymes of the base excision repair pathway (3Seeberg E. Eide L. Bjoras M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 391-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The first common repair step is an AP endonuclease, which cleaves the DNA backbone at the abasic site (4Barzilay G. Hickson I.D. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). UNG enzymes have been identified in a wide variety of organisms, including human, Escherichia coli, and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). They are well conserved; the HSV-1 and human enzymes have 39% sequence identity, whereas the HSV-1 and E. coli enzymes are 49% identical.

Tainer J.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The DNA-binding pocket of UNG is highly specific for uracil in DNA. Other DNA bases and uracils in RNA are excluded from this DNA-binding pocket due to unfavorable steric and hydrogen bond interactions (5Savva R. McAuley-Hecht K. Brown T. Pearl L. Nature. 1995; 373: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 6Mol C.D. Arvai A.S. Slupphaug G. Kavli B. Alseth I. Krokan H.E. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1995; 80: 869-878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). A number of previous studies on both the human and HSV-1 UNG enzymes have indicated possible differences in their catalytic behavior. Notably, hUNG has been reported to bind tightly to its abasic product DNA, and it has been proposed that the action of hUNG is coupled to the common base excision repair steps via AP endonuclease (9Parikh S.S. Mol C.D. Slupphaug G. Bharati S. Krokan H.E. Tainer J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5214-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). In comparison, HSV-1 UNG has been observed to bind product DNA only weakly (10Bellamy S.R. Baldwin G.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3857-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 11Panayotou G. Brown T. Barlow T. Pearl L.H. Savva R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 45-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), making coupling of these two events unlikely in the viral enzyme. Furthermore, hUNG has been cited as having a higher Km value (8Slupphaug G. Mol C.D. Kavli B. Arvai A.S. Krokan H.E. Tainer J.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 12Slupphaug G. Eftedal I. Kavli B. Bharati S. Helle N.M. Haug T. Levine D.W. Krokan H.E.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3857-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and this has informed the description of hUNG as having a single function in post-replicative repair of U·A mismatches (14Nilsen H. Haushalter K.A. Robins P. Barnes D.E. Verdine G.L. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4278-4286Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In light of these reported differences between the viral and human UNG enzymes, we decided to investigate both enzymes in kinetic and DNA binding studies. The objective was to precisely identify any differences between these two highly related DNA repair enzymes, with a view to further defining their functional roles as well as exploring the potential of viral UNG as a therapeutic target. A previous report has indicated that nucleotide analogs may provide specific inhibitors for the HSV-1 enzyme (15Sekino Y. Bruner S.D. Verdine G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36506-36508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We therefore wished to investigate the DNA binding of both human and HSV-1 UNG enzymes to non-cleavable substrate analogs both as a probe to investigate protein-DNA interactions and to further explore the possibility of finding specific inhibitors of viral UNG. We investigated the catalytic rates and DNA binding properties of both wild-type and mutant forms of human and viral UNG using both biochemical and biophysical assays. These included quench reactions to monitor the rate of N-glycosyl hydrolysis and a fluorescence assay to follow steady-state reactions. Furthermore, the binding of the human and HSV-1 UNG enzymes to substrate DNA and abasic product DNA was examined by fluorescence anisotropy. Catalytically inactive mutant enzymes were used in studies of the binding of UNG to uracil-containing substrates. In addition, the binding activity of wild-type UNG was measured using the non-hydrolyzable substrate analogs 2′-deoxypseudouridine (dΨrd) and 2′-α-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (α-FdUrd). We also performed crystallographic analysis of HSV-1 mutant UNG to compare the active-site structure and mode of uracil binding to the wild-type enzyme. Plasmid Constructions—HSV-1 wild-type UNG was prepared using the recombinant plasmid pTS106.1 (5Savva R. McAuley-Hecht K. Brown T. Pearl L. Nature. 1995; 373: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out on pTS106.1 to construct the HSV-1 D88N and H210N UNG single mutants. The HSV-1 D88N/H210N UNG double mutant was constructed by cloning an XbaI fragment of the pH210N plasmid, which contains the H210N mutation, into the pD88N plasmid. All mutants were verified by sequencing. The recombinant hUNG plasmid pUNG15 was purchased from American Type Culture Collection. The truncated hUNG gene encoding amino acids 84-304 of hUNG was subcloned into expression vector pRSET-B (Invitrogen) using NcoI/HindIII restriction sites. The DNA fragment encoding the enterokinase recognition site located between the N-terminal polyhistidine tag and the truncated hUNG gene was deleted by NcoI/NheI digestion, fill-in reaction (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and plasmid religation, resulting in pHUNG4. The D145N and H268N mutations were introduced into pHUNG4 by site-directed mutagenesis. Human D145N/H268N UNG was subsequently generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the plasmid containing the D145N hUNG gene as a template. All mutants were verified by sequencing. Protein Overexpression and Purification—HSV-1 UNG was overexpressed and purified as described previously (10Bellamy S.R. Baldwin G.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3857-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The D88N, H210N, and D88N/H210N mutant enzymes were expressed and purified from a construct in exactly the same manner. hUNG and its mutant enzymes were expressed in E. coli BH156. The cultures were grown in LB broth at 37 °C to A600 = 0.8 before induction with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cultures were grown for an additional 3 h at 37 °C before the cells were harvested. The harvested cells were lysed by sonication in buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 50 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, and a tablet of EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 45 min. The clarified lysate was loaded onto a nickel-Sepharose column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 50 mm imidazole, and 300 mm NaCl. After washing, the UNG enzyme was eluted from the column with a gradient of 50-500 mm imidazole. The fractions were assayed by SDS-PAGE, and those containing UNG were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration. The concentrated fractions were diluted with 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol so that the NaCl concentration was <0.02 m. The partially purified protein was then applied to a poly(U)-Sepharose affinity column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol; and after washing, the UNG enzyme was eluted with a gradient of 0-1 m NaCl. The pure enzyme was then concentrated by ultrafiltration. The concentration of the protein was calculated from the absorbance at 280 nm based on an extinction coefficient of 48.9 × 103m-1 cm-1. DNA Synthesis and Purification—Oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized by MWG Biotech. All modifications were incorporated into oligonucleotides at the point of synthesis using conventional phosphoramidite chemistry. The phosphoramidites of 2′-dUrd, dΨrd, α-FdUrd, 2-aminopurine (2-AP), and hexachlorofluorescein were also supplied by MWG Biotech. Oligonucleotides were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography as described previously (17Baldwin G.S. Vipond I.B. Halford S.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 705-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Double-stranded substrates and abasic oligonucleotides were made as described previously (10Bellamy S.R. Baldwin G.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3857-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Kinetic Assays—Steady-state fluorescence spectra were measured on a HORIBA Jobin Yvon FluoroMax 3 spectrofluorometer. The 2-AP fluorescence was recorded with an excitation wavelength of 310 nm and an emission wavelength of 370 nm using a 5-mm cuvette. Steady-state fluorescence assays were performed at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg ml-1 bovine serum albumin, and 2 mm MgCl2 using the hUNG enzyme to give a final concentration of 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 nm. The endpoint of the reaction was determined by addition of the second aliquot of high concentration UNG. The initial velocity (μm s-1) was then calculated from the initial linear progression in fluorescence and the total change in fluorescence. The rate (s-1) was calculated by dividing the initial velocity by the total enzyme concentration. Single turnover quench reactions were performed at 25 °C with 32P-labeled Urd substrate (0.1 μm; see Table 1) and mutant UNG enzymes (1 μm) in standard reaction buffers (HSV-1 UNG: 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mg ml-1 bovine serum albumin; and hUNG: 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mg ml-1 bovine serum albumin). The assay was otherwise performed as described previously (18O'Neill R.J. Vorob'eva O.V. Shahbakhti H. Zmuda E. Bhagwat A.S. Baldwin G.S. J. Biol.

Data were recorded using an excitation wavelength of 530 nm and an emission wavelength of 555 nm. The binding assays were conducted at 25 °C in reaction buffer by titrating increasing concentrations of the unlabeled ssU oligonucleotide into a fixed concentration of the fluorescent HU oligonucleotide and D88N/H210N UNG. Data were analyzed following the method of Reid et al. (19Reid S.L. Parry D. Liu H.H. Connolly B.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2484-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) using the program Scientist (MicroMath Research). Equilibrium DNA Binding Assays—Equilibrium DNA binding assays were performed by fluorescence anisotropy using the same spectroscopic settings described above to examine the binding of the wild-type and mutant UNG enzymes to the 5′-hexachlorofluorescein-labeled oligonucleotides (Table 1). The binding assays were conducted at 25 °C in reaction buffer by titrating fixed concentrations of the fluorescent DNA with increasing amounts of the enzyme. The observed anisotropy was plotted against the concentration of enzyme, and the data were fitted to the quadratic binding equation (Equation 1) using GraFit Version 5.0,A=AD+(ADE-AD)×(((Kd+[E]0+[DNA]T)-(-Kd-[E]0-[DNA]T2-4[E]0[DNA]T))/(2[DNA]T))Eq. 1 where [DNA]T is the concentration of DNA used in each experiment, A is the observed anisotropy, AD is the anisotropy for free DNA, ADE is the anisotropy for enzyme-bound DNA, Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant, and [E]0 is the total enzyme concentration. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination and Refinement—Crystals of HSV-1 D88N/H210N UNG were obtained in microbatch experiments at 25 °C at 30 mg ml-1 protein in 6% polyethylene glycol 4000 and 40 mm imidazole (pH 6.8). The D88N/H210N UNG-uracil complexes were obtained by soaking native crystals in 11% polyethylene glycol 4000, 42 mm imidazole (pH 6.8), and 20 mm 2′-dUrd (Sigma) for 16 h. Diffraction data were collected on a Quantum 4 CCD detector (Area Detection Systems Corp.) with 0.978-Å radiation on beamline 9.6 of the Daresbury Synchrotron Radiation Source (Cheshire, UK). Diffraction images were processed using Denzo and Scalepack (HKL Research, Inc). Parameters for the data collection and processing are given in Table 2. The structure of HSV-1 D88N/H210N UNG was determined by molecular replacement using molrep (20Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4136) Google Scholar) and the structure of HSV-1 wild-type UNG (Protein Data Bank code 1UDG) as a search model. The best molecular replacement solution gave a correlation coefficient of 0.470 and an R-factor of 0.438, with corresponding values for the next highest peak of 0.252 and 0.528. The protein model transformed by the molecular replacement solution was refined against the observed diffraction data using CNS (21Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

The structure of D88N/H210N UNG was further refined by stereochemically restrained simulated annealing and positional refinement with the program CNS (21Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L.

Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Progress was monitored throughout by the consistent decrease in the crystallographic R-factor and verified by cross-validation by a corresponding decrease in Rfree. The quality of the refined model was determined using the programs PROCHECK (24Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

The refinement statistics of D88N/H210N UNG are shown in Table 2. Data for HSV-1 D88N/H210N UNG in complex with uracil were collected on the Quantum 4 CCD detector with 0.87-Å radiation on beamline 9.6 of the Daresbury Synchrotron Radiation Source. The complex crystal had the same space group as the native crystal. Data collection statistics are shown in Table 2. The structure of D88N/H210N UNG in complex with uracil was determined by molecular replacement using molrep (20Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4136) Google Scholar) and the structure of native D88N/H210N UNG as a search model. The correct solution gave the highest correlation coefficient of 0.507 and an R-factor of 0.400, with corresponding values for the next solution of 0.336 and 0.501, respectively. The model of the complex was refined and rebuilt as described above. The Fo - Fc maps indicate the presence of a uracil base in the active site of UNG. The uracil was constructed and refined with the protein model using CNS (21Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16947) Google Scholar). The final model gave refinement statistics as shown in Table 2. Steady-state Analysis—Steady-state reactions were performed with hUNG to determine its kinetic parameters under the same conditions that had been previously used for HSV-1 UNG (10Bellamy S.R. Baldwin G.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3857-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The fluorescent base analog 2-AP was used to monitor the kinetics of glycosidic bond cleavage by incorporation next to a uracil base in oligonucleotide substrates (Table 1). Because the quantum yield of 2-AP is very sensitive to its environment and displays strong quenching when stacked in DNA (26Law S.M. Eritja R. Goodman M.F. Breslauer K.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12329-12337Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), removal of the uracil base adjacent to 2-AP by UNG results in a large increase in fluorescence (27Stivers J.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3837-3844Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that incorporation of 2-AP does not affect the binding of the UNG enzyme to the oligonucleotide (10Bellamy S.R. Baldwin G.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3857-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). hUNG reactions were performed with a single-stranded oligonucleotide substrate (1U) and double-stranded forms of the substrate containing either a U·G mismatch or a U·A base pair (1U·G and 1U·A, respectively). The rate constants showed a hyperbolic dependence upon the substrate concentration, and the data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Fig. 1), giving the steady-state parameters kcat and Km.We also determined that removal of the N-terminal His tag from hUNG had no impact on the catalytic constants (data not shown). The kinetic parameters for hUNG with different substrates are shown compared with those for HSV-1 UNG (Table 3) (10Bellamy S.R. Baldwin G.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3857-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The kinetic data show an 8-50-fold higher kcat/Km value for hUNG compared with that for HSV-1 UNG. This represents a significantly increased catalytic efficiency for hUNG.TABLE 3Comparison of steady-state data of the human and HSV-1 UNG enzymes Steady-state reactions were performed with the substrates shown in Table 1 using fluorescence assays. The kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The parameters kcat and Km for HSV-1 UNG are from Bellamy and Baldwin (10Bellamy S.R. Baldwin G.S.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11866-11875Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We have made Asn mutations for both of these residues, both singly and in combination for the human and HSV-1 UNG enzymes, for the purpose of generating inactive mutant enzymes for DNA binding studies. Furthermore, we intend to explore the role of these residues in catalysis and substrate binding. The activity of the UNG mutants was monitored under single turnover conditions using the quench assay with the 32P-labeled ssU oligonucleotide (18O'Neill R.J. Vorob'eva O.V. Shahbakhti H. Zmuda E. Bhagwat A.S. Baldwin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20526-20532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the substrate is in excess over the enzyme; and hence, only a single turnover of the reaction occurs: under saturating conditions, the accumulation of product corresponds directly to the rate of N-glycosidic bond cleavage. The observed rate of cleavage (kobs) was determined by fitting the accumulation of product to either a single exponential or a linear equation. Reactions were performed under saturating conditions with a 10-fold excess of the single mutant UNG enzymes (human D145N and H268N and HSV-1 D88N and H210N) over the 32P-labeled substrate. The reactions demonstrated that the single mutants of UNG contain some residual activity (Fig. 2). However, the human D145N/H268N and HSV-1 D88N/H210N UNG double mutants showed no UNG activity even after 24 h with a 10-fold excess of the enzyme (data not shown). Equilibrium DNA Binding—To prevent turnover of substrate in DNA binding experiments, it is necessary to use either inactive enzyme mutants or substrates that are refractory to cleavage. In this study, we used both approaches. As described above, the human D145N/H268N and HSV-1 D88N/H210N UNG double mutants had no activity even after 24 h under standard reaction conditions and are thus suitable for use in DNA binding studies. In addition, the human H268N and HSV-1 H210N UNG enzymes were deemed sufficiently inactive to be used in binding assays with uracil-containing substrates. However, the human D145N and HSV-1 D88N UNG single mutants had sufficient residual activity that they could be used only with the non-cleavable substrate analogs and abasic product DNA. We used two non-cleavable substrate analogs (dΨrd and α-FdUrd). The pucker of the ribose sugar is largely determined by the electronegativity of the 2′-substituent; hence, RNA has a C-3′-endo sugar pucker, whereas DNA has a C-2′-endo sugar pucker (29Uesugi S. Miki H. Ikehara M. Iwahashi H. Kyogoku Y. Tetrahedron Lett. 1979; 20: 4073-4076Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Similarly, both the α- and β-2′-fluorouridine derivatives favor the C-3′-endo pucker (30Wil"

In this study, we further examined the functions of group 2 σ factors of RNA polymerase in NtcA-dependent nitrogen-related gene expression in PCC 6803.

We also confirmed the contribution of SigB and SigC to the transcription of other NtcA-dependent genes, glnA, sigE, and amt1, as in the case of glnB. On the other hand, the transcription of glnN was dependent on SigB and SigE. In the SigB and SigC-based regulation, the level of SigB increased, but that of SigC was constant under conditions of nitrogen deprivation. Furthermore, it was found that SigC negatively and positively regulates the level of SigB in the log and stationary phase, respectively. SigC also had a positive effect on the level of sigB transcript during the stationary phase. In contrast, SigB acts positively on SigC levels in both growth phases. These results and previous findings indicated that multiple group 2 σ factors take part in the control of NtcA-dependent nitrogen-related gene expression in cooperation with a group 1 σ factor, SigA. It has been reported that an RNA polymerase σ factor, SigC, mainly contributes to specific transcription from the promoter PglnB-54,-53 under nitrogen-deprived conditions during the stationary phase of cell growth in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 (Asayama, M., Imamura, S., Yoshihara, S., Miyazaki, A., Yoshida, N., Sazuka, T., Kaneko, T., Ohara, O., Tabata, S., Osanai, T., Tanaka, K., Takahashi, H., and Shirai, M. (2004) Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 68, 477-487).

The RNA polymerase holoenzyme of eubacteria consists of a core enzyme and σ factor (1Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2483-2489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The core enzyme is capable of undergoing transcriptional elongation, and the σ factor is required for the initiation of transcription from a specific promoter sequence. Multiple σ factors are usually encoded by a eubacterial genome, and they have been generally classified into three groups (2Lonetto M. Gribskov M. Gross C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3843-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Group 1 comprises principal σ factors that are responsible for transcription from a number of housekeeping promoters and are eventually crucial for cell viability. Group 2 and group 3 σ factors are alternative types. Group 2 σ factors are similar to the group 1 types in molecular structure but are nonessential for cell viability. Group 3 σ factors are structurally different from proteins of group 1 and group 2 and are sometimes involved in the transcription of regulons for survival under stress. The cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 used in this study possesses nine species of σ factors assigned to group 1 (SigA), group 2 (SigB, SigC, SigD, and SigE), and group 3 (SigF, SigG, SigH, and SigI) (3Kaneko T.

Takahashi H. Asayama M. Shirai M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The functions of some of these σ factors have been recently revealed. For example, SigD and SigB are light- and dark-responsive σ factors (4Imamura S. Yoshihara S. Nakano S. Shiozaki N. Yamada A. Tanaka K. Takahashi H. Asayama M. Shirai M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 5Imamura S. Asayama M. Takahashi H. Tanaka K. Takahashi H. Shirai M.

SigB is also identified as a heat-shock σ factor (4Imamura S. Yoshihara S. Nakano S. Shiozaki N. Yamada A. Tanaka K. Takahashi H. Asayama M. Shirai M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 6Imamura S. Asayama M. Shirai M. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 1175-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). SigE is a σ factor required for positive regulation of sugar catabolic pathways (7Osanai T. Kanesaki Y. Nakano T. Takahashi H. Asayama M. Shirai M. Kanehisa M. Suzuki I. Murata N. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30653-30659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Cyanobacteria, blue-green algae, are prokaryotes that perform oxygenic evolving photosynthesis like plants and mainly use inorganic nitrogen sources, ammonium and nitrate. The nitrate is reduced by nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase, and the resulting ammonium is usually incorporated with glutamine synthetase (GS) and glutamate synthase (GOGAT), a pathway commonly known as the GS-GOGAT cycle (8Merrick M.J. Edwards R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 604-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this cycle, 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG), 2The abbreviations used are: 2-OG, 2-oxoglutarate; RNAP, RNA polymerase; QRT-PCR, quantitative real time PCR; IS, integration site; ppGpp, guanosine 3,5-(bis)pyrophosphate; ΔB, ΔC, ΔD, and ΔE, sigB, sigC, sigD, and sigE knock-out strain, respectively; Log, midexponential phase; Sta, stationary phase; -N and +N, without and with nitrogen, respectively; GS, glutamine synthase; GOGAT, glutamate synthase. which is synthesized by isocitrate dehydrogenase from isocitrate, is used as a carbon skeleton for nitrogen assimilation. A remarkable feature of the intermediary metabolism of cyanobacteria is a lack of 2-OG dehydrogenase (9Stanier R.Y. Cohen-Bazire G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1977; 31: 225-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Consequently, 2-OG is a main substrate for nitrogen assimilation in cyanobacteria. The system regulating nitrogen levels is well characterized in enteric bacteria (8Merrick M.J. Edwards R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 604-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Arcondeguy T. Jack R. Merrick M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 80-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Expression of glnA (encoding glutamine synthetase) and other nitrogen-related genes is required for RNAP-containing RpoN (σ54), an alternative σ factor whose molecular structure and transcriptional mechanism are quite different from those of group 1-3 σ factors (11Reitzer L.J. Magasanik B. Cell. 1986; 45: 785-792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The expression is regulated by a two-component regulatory system, NtrB/NtrC, the activity of which is controlled by the uridylylation status of PII (8Merrick M.J. Edwards R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 604-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Arcondeguy T. Jack R. Merrick M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 80-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The uridylylation or nonuridylylation of PII is coordinated by the ratio of intracellular concentrations of 2-OG and glutamine. PII itself binds 2-OG; therefore, it senses the status of the cells and plays a central role in the assimilation of nitrogen. The regulation of nitrogen assimilation could differ between enteric bacteria and cyanobacteria, because no homologues of RpoN-type σ factor, NtrB/NtrC, and glutamine synthetase adenylyltransferase have been identified in cyanobacteria. In fact, a cAMP receptor protein family transcription factor, NtcA, plays a central role in nitrogen assimilation in cyanobacteria. A consensus sequence needed for the binding of NtcA to DNA (TGAN8TAC) has been reported, and the motif is generally located about 40 bp upstream from the transcription start point (12Herrero A. Muro-Pastor A.M. Flores E. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 411-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The promoters activated by NtcA exhibit a conserved sequence, TAN3T, as a -10 promoter hexamer but do not possess a -35 hexamer. Under nitrogen-deprived conditions, 2-OG directly binds to NtcA and increases the DNA binding affinity of NtcA (13Vazquez-Bermudez M.F. Herrero A. Flores E. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 14Tanigawa R. Shirokane M. Maeda S. Omata T. Tanaka K. Takahashi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4251-4255Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). NtcA with 2-OG activates the expression of nitrogen assimilation-related genes. Although 2-OG and NtcA play key roles in the assimilation of nitrogen, a molecular study of NtcA-dependent transcription has been performed only in a few cases in cyanobacteria. For example, Muro-Pastor et al. (15Muro-Pastor A.M. Herrero A. Flores E. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1090-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) have reported that the group 2 σ factor gene, sigE (rpoD2-V), possesses the NtcA-binding motif upstream of its promoter, and its transcription is induced under nitrogen-deprived conditions. Expression of glnN, a type-3 glutamine synthase gene, was impaired in strains bearing an inactivated copy of the sigE gene of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (15Muro-Pastor A.M. Herrero A. Flores E. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1090-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Our recent study revealed that transcription from the glnB (encoding PII) (16Forchhammer K. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2004; 28: 319-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) promoter (PglnB-54,-53) is due to specific recognition by a PCC 6803 group 2 σ factor, SigC, in the stationary (postexponential) growth phase under nitrogen-deprived conditions (17Asayama M. Imamura S. Yoshihara S. Miyazaki A. Yoshida N. Sazuka T. Kaneko T. Ohara O. Tabata S. Osanai T. Tanaka K. Takahashi H. Shirai M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2004; 68: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This raised the possibility that another σ factor recognizes the glnB promoter in the logarithmic (exponential) growth phase and that a “σ-switch” for the nitrogen-promoter recognition occurs during the log to stationary phase. However, which σ factor recognizes the glnB promoter under the log phase has remained to be elucidated. Here, we presented data for resolving this issue. We also characterized the specificity with which PCC 6803 group 2 σ factors recognize other NtcA-dependent promoters, glnA, sigE, amt, and glnN. We summarize these results and present a possible regulatory network of group 1 and group 2 σ factors for the transcription of NtcA-dependent nitrogen-related genes. Strains and Growth Conditions—Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 (Kazusa strain) was grown at 30 °C with shaking (120 rpm, NR-30, TAITEC, Tokyo, Japan) under white light (35 μmol m-2 s-1 photon flexture) in BG11 medium (18Rippka R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 3-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar), supplemented with 15 μg/ml kanamycin sulfate and/or 40 μg/ml spectinomycin if required. For nitrogen-starved conditions, PCC 6803 was cultivated in BG11 medium without NaNO3 for 6 h, as described previously (17Asayama M. Imamura S. Yoshihara S. Miyazaki A. Yoshida N. Sazuka T. Kaneko T. Ohara O. Tabata S. Osanai T. Tanaka K. Takahashi H. Shirai M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2004; 68: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Isolation of RNA and Primer Extension Analysis—Procedures were performed as described previously (19Asayama M. Tanaka K. Takahashi H. Sato A. Aida T. Shirai M. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 181: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used in the primer extension for glnB, glnA, amt1, glnN, sigB, and sigC were glnB-R2 (17Asayama M. Imamura S. Yoshihara S. Miyazaki A. Yoshida N. Sazuka T. Kaneko T. Ohara O. Tabata S. Osanai T. Tanaka K. Takahashi H. Shirai M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2004; 68: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), glnA-R (5′-CGTCTTGGATCCACTTGAGGACTTC-3′), amt1-R4 (5′-CTACATTGTTCTACGAAAG-3′), glnN-R2 (5′-GCCAGAAGATAGAGGTCGA-3′), sigB-R2 (4Imamura S. Yoshihara S. Nakano S. Shiozaki N. Yamada A. Tanaka K. Takahashi H. Asayama M. Shirai M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and 0184V-R3 (5′-TCGTTGCTTGGTTTAGTC-3′), respectively. The products of reverse transcription were dissolved in 7 μl of a dye solution and denatured at 95 °C for 3 min. Then an aliquot of 3 μl was resolved on a 7% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea followed by autoradiography. Quantitative Real Time PCR Analysis—Quantitative real time PCR (QRT-PCR) was performed as described previously (17Asayama M. Imamura S. Yoshihara S. Miyazaki A. Yoshida N. Sazuka T. Kaneko T. Ohara O. Tabata S. Osanai T. Tanaka K. Takahashi H. Shirai M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2004; 68: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The set of oligonucleotides used for glnB, glnA, glnN, sigE, amt1, and rrn16Sa was as follows: glnB-RT-F/glnB-RT-R (17Asayama M. Imamura S. Yoshihara S. Miyazaki A. Yoshida N. Sazuka T. Kaneko T. Ohara O. Tabata S. Osanai T. Tanaka K. Takahashi H. Shirai M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2004; 68: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), glnA-RT-F (5′-CCAAACACCGCCACCATC-3′/glnA-RT-R (5′-GCTGGAGTTTTCCGTTTGG-3′), glnN-RT-F2 (5′-CCTGGAAGATATGTGGGCTG-3′)/glnN-RT-R (5′-GTAGGCAGGACTGGTTAC-3′), sigE-RT-F (5′-AAGAAATGGCCCGCTATCCC-3′)/sigE-RT-R (5′-TTCGTTCCAGTTGTTGGGTG-3′), amt1-RT-F (5′-GGCAGCAGTGGCAATCCC-3′)/amt1-RT-R (5′-GCTACAGCACCGGAAACA-3′), and 16srRNA-RTF (5′-CTGAAGATGGGCTCGCGT-3′)/16srRNA-RTR (5′-CGTATTACCGCGGCTGCT-3′), respectively. Standard curves for each gene were also constructed with serial dilutions (1 to 1 × 5-3) of cDNA, synthesized with total RNA extracted from wild-type cells under nitrogen-deprived conditions at the log phase. Respective relative levels of transcripts were calculated with the relevant standard curve. Assays without cDNA were conducted for each experiment as a negative control. All assays were done in triplicate. Plasmids and a Strain for Complementation Tests—The plasmid DNA, pOXL6803-COMP-B, used in this study was constructed as follows. A plasmid, pOXL6803-2 (20Aoki S. Kondo T. Ishiura M. J. Microbiol. Methods. 2002; 49: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), was digested with SmaI and KpnI followed by MungBean treatment, and then a resultant 10.9-kb fragment was self-ligated to create pOXL-6803-3. Fragments annealed with oligonucleotides, GATCCCCGGGGGTACCA and GGGCCCCCATGGTCTAG (double underlines, underlines, and italic type indicate a sequence that can unite with a BglII site, an SmaI site, and a KpnI site, respectively) were restricted with BglII and cloned into the same restriction enzyme cutting site of pOXL6803-3 to yield pOXL6803-4-6. A PCR-amplified BglII-SacII 1538-bp segment containing the PCC 6803 sigB gene and its promoter region (-500 to +1038, +1 as the initiation codon) was cloned into the same restriction enzyme site of pOXL6803-4-6 to make pOXL6803-COMP-B. For the construction of pOXL6803-COMP-C, a PCR-amplified KpnI-SacII 1715-bp segment containing the PCC 6803 sigC gene and its promoter region (-500 to +1215) was cloned into the same restriction enzyme site of pOXL6803-4-6. Natural transformation (21Golden S.S. Brusslan J. Haselkorn R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 215-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 22Ito Y. Asayama M. Shirai M. Biosci. Biotechnol.

Genomics. 2002; 267: 684-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was carried out with pOXL6803-COMP plasmids, and transformants were selected on BG 11 plates containing spectinomycin (40 μg/ml) and kanamycin (15 μg/ml). Polyclonal Antibody for NtcA and Western Blot Analysis—Overexpression and purification of PCC 6803 NtcA were achieved as described previously (17Asayama M. Imamura S. Yoshihara S. Miyazaki A. Yoshida N. Sazuka T. Kaneko T. Ohara O. Tabata S. Osanai T. Tanaka K. Takahashi H. Shirai M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2004; 68: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The purified NtcA was subjected to SDS-PAGE and recovered from the gel. The gel was splintered off and mixed with adjuvant, and this mixture was injected into a rabbit whose serum (1:500 dilution) did not cross-react to PCC 6803 total protein (50 μg) during Western blotting. The Western blotting was performed as described previously (4Imamura S. Yoshihara S. Nakano S. Shiozaki N. Yamada A. Tanaka K. Takahashi H. Asayama M. Shirai M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The dilution for rabbit serums of the antibody was 1:1,000, 1:500, 1:1,000, 1:1,000, 1:1,000, 1:500, and 1:1,000 for PCC 6803 SigA, SigB, SigC, SigD, SigE, RpoB, and NtcA, respectively. RNA Polymerase Core Enzyme and σ Factors—Purification of the reconstituted PCC 6803 core enzyme with each recombinant subunit was performed as reported previously (6Imamura S. Asayama M. Shirai M. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 1175-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) but with some improvements to the renaturation and reconstitution steps. Previously, the renaturation and reconstitution of RNAP core enzyme were done at the same time in one tube. During these steps, γ (RpoC1) subunits in particular tended to aggregate and consequently the RNAP sometimes lacked the γ subunit. Therefore, for the renaturation of RNAP subunits, purified RpoA-His (His tag attached at the C-terminal domain) or crude RpoB, RpoC1, and RpoC2 dissolved in Buffer G were separately dialyzed against the reconstitution buffer at 4 °C for 16 h (6Imamura S. Asayama M. Shirai M. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 1175-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). After clearance of the debris by centrifugation, each supernatant was mixed in the following molar ratio, α:β:β′:γ = 1:1:2:4, and incubated at 30 °C for 14 h to reconstitute the PCC 6803 core enzyme. After incubation, the reconstituted core enzyme was purified as described previously (6Imamura S. Asayama M. Shirai M. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 1175-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and the purified fractions were concentrated by centrifugation using an Amicon Ultra-4 filter unit (100-kDa molecular mass cut-off; Millipore Corp.). PCC 6803 σ factors were also prepared by methods reported previously (4Imamura S. Yoshihara S. Nakano S. Shiozaki N. Yamada A. Tanaka K. Takahashi H. Asayama M. Shirai M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 6Imamura S. Asayama M. Shirai M. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 1175-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In Vitro Transcription Analysis—Multiple-round run-off assays were performed as described previously (6Imamura S. Asayama M. Shirai M. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 1175-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 24Shibato J. Asayama M. Shirai M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1442: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The assay mixture (40 μl) comprised 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05 mm EDTA·2Na, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm each ATP/CTP/GTP/UTP, 25 nm RNAP core enzyme, 100 nm σ factor, 2.5 nm template DNA, and/or 300 nm NtcA and 3 mm 2-OG. The constructs of template DNA used in this study are as follows: pGLN9B (17Asayama M. Imamura S. Yoshihara S. Miyazaki A. Yoshida N. Sazuka T. Kaneko T. Ohara O. Tabata S. Osanai T. Tanaka K. Takahashi H. Shirai M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2004; 68: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); pYS1756, a 419-bp segment of the PCR-amplified SmaI-BglII PCC 6803 glnA promoter region (-375 to +44) cloned into the same restriction enzyme site of pUC119B (25Asayama M. Hayasaka Y. Kabasawa M. Shirai M. Ohyama A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); pAMT1, pKK-T1, a 550-bp segment of the PCR-amplified BglII-BglII PCC 6803 amt1 promoter region (-550 to +50) cloned into pKK223-3 the same as pKK-A2 (6Imamura S. Asayama M. Shirai M. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 1175-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), digested with HindIII followed by Klenow treatment, and then digested with BglII and a 466-bp fragment containing the amt1 promoter region (-416 to +50) cloned the same as the glnA promoter region; and pGLNN, a 341-bp segment of the PCR-amplified SmaI-BglII PCC 6803 glnN promoter region (-241 to +100), cloned the same as the glnA promoter region. The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 15 min, and then the reaction was stopped with the addition of 60 μl of stop solution (40 mm EDTA·2Na, 300 μg/ml Escherichia coli tRNA, and 300 mm LiCl). The RNA products were precipitated with 2-propanol and dissolved in 10 μl of RNase-free water. The samples were subjected to primer extension as mentioned above. Growth Phase-dependent Regulation of the glnB Transcript by SigB and SigC—Our previous study has indicated that SigC controls synthesis of the glnB transcript from PglnB-54,-53 induced by nitrogen deprivation in the stationary phase. However, which group 2 σ factors recognize and regulate the glnB promoter during the log phase? To answer this question, we examined the glnB transcript using primer extension in all other knock-out strains missing the group 2 σ factors SigB, SigD, and SigE (Fig. 1). PCC 6803 glnB possesses two transcription start points: PglnB-33, an E. coli RpoD-type promoter, transcription from which is constitutive, and PglnB-54,-53, an NtcA-dependent promoter, transcription from which is induced under nitrogen-deprived conditions (Table 1). Primer extension analyses showed that the amount of transcript synthesized from PglnB-54,-53 in the sigB knock-out strain (ΔsigB) was significantly reduced during the log phase (Log) regardless of nitrogen levels. A slight reduction was observed in the stationary phase (Sta) under nitrogen-deprived conditions (-N). These results indicate that SigB mainly contributes to the expression of glnB in the log phase. In contrast, similar amounts of the glnB transcript were observed in the ΔsigD and ΔsigE strains, compared with wild-type cells during both phases, indicating that SigD and SigE do not contribute to glnB expression. In this situation, SigA drives the transcription from PglnB-33, because the transcripts were almost constitutively expressed even in the knock-out strains. This supports previous results (17Asayama M. Imamura S. Yoshihara S. Miyazaki A. Yoshida N. Sazuka T. Kaneko T. Ohara O. Tabata S. Osanai T. Tanaka K. Takahashi H. Shirai M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2004; 68: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).TABLE 1A nucleotide sequence alignment of the NtcA-activated promoter regions in PCC 6803 Boxes, -10 hexamers; double underlines, NtcA-binding motifs; bold face letters, consensus nucleotide sequences; lower case letters, transcription start sites. Open table in a new tab Complementation of SigB Function in the Knock-out Strain—To confirm that SigB and SigC actually function in cells, a complementation test was conducted for glnB expression. Plasmids pOXL6803-COMP-B and pOXL6803-COMP-C (see “Experimental Procedures”), carrying sigB and sigC, respectively, were constructed and introduced into the knock-out strains by a method of natural transformation (21Golden S.S. Brusslan J. Haselkorn R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 215-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 22Ito Y. Asayama M. Shirai M. Biosci. Biotechnol.

After homologous recombination between the plasmids and PCC 6803 genomes (Fig. 2A), we obtained a transformant called “Comp-ΔsigB,” which is resistant to kanamycin and spectinomycin. Unfortunately, we could not obtain a transformant of “Comp-ΔsigC,” suggesting that some factor would not allow the transformation. To verify the recombination in Comp-ΔsigB, we conducted PCR and Western blot analyses. The results are shown in Fig. 2, B and C. When a set of primers, 0306II-F and 0306II-R (4Imamura S. Yoshihara S.

Biol. 2003; 325: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), which can amplify a region of sigB (1.0 kb) were used, bands of 1.0 and 2.5 kb were detected with Comp-ΔsigB genomic DNA (Fig. 2B, left). However, when a set of primers, IS-F (5′-TTGGAGGTCATCGAGTTTGG-3′) and IS-R (5′-GAAGATCTCAGGCAAAAGCCAATGAGTG-3′), which amplify a region around the integration site (IS) of ssl0410, were used, a band of 3.6 kb was detected with Comp-ΔsigB genomic DNA (Fig. 2B, right), confirming that this recombination involved a double-crossover reaction. We further confirmed the complementation of sigB expression at the protein level in Comp-ΔsigB (Fig. 2C). The RpoB antibody was used as a loading control for all proteins in Western blotting. Finally, we verified that SigB compensated for the transcription from PglnB-54,-53 under Log/-N, in which SigB significantly influences the expression of glnB as shown in Fig. 1 (Fig. 2D). Although the amount of transcript from PglnB-33 was the same in the three strains, the amount from PglnB-54,-53 was restored in Comp-ΔsigB to the level observed in the wild type. Thus, we concluded that SigB contributes to the expression of glnB under nitrogen-deprived conditions. SigB and SigC Contribute to Nitrogen-related Gene Expression—The glnB transcript was further analyzed by QRT-PCR. Amounts of the transcript were reduced ∼30% relative to levels in wild-type cells in the ΔsigB strain during the log and stationary phases (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, there was also a 45% reduction in the ΔsigC strain in the stationary phase (Fig. 3A). These results well support the data shown in Fig. 1 and again indicate that SigB and SigC mainly contribute to transcription from PglnB-53,-54 under conditions of nitrogen deprivation in a growth phase-dependent manner. In this case, the QRT-PCR analysis was useful for measuring the amount of glnB transcript although the gene possesses multiple promoters (Fig. 3A, top), PglnB-54,-53 (an NtcA-dependent nitrogen deprivation-responsive promoter recognized by SigB and SigC) and PglnB-33 (a constitutive promoter recognized by SigA), and could practically resolve the decrease in transcription from the NtcA-dependent promoter in the knock-out strains. To clarify whether SigB and SigC contribute to the expression of other nitrogen-related genes, we characterized another four NtcA-dependent promoters (Table 1), transcription from which is induced under nitrogen-deprived conditions in PCC 6803: glnA, a type-1 glutamine synthase gene; sigE, a group 2 σ factor gene; amt1, an ammonium permease gene; and glnN, a type-3 glutamine synthase gene, in respective knock-out strains. QRT-PCR analyses also revealed that the transcription of glnA, sigE, and amt1 decreased ∼30-40% in the sigB knock-out strain in the log phase and ∼34-50% in the sigB or sigC knock-out strain in the stationary phase under conditions of nitrogen deprivation (Fig. 3, B-D). We used rrn16Sa as a control and observed an almost constant level of expression in the knock-out strains (Fig. 3F). These results were similar to those found in the case of glnB, indicating that the contribution of SigB and SigC to the NtcA-dependent promoters might be conserved in PCC 6803. The profile of transcription of glnN in the sigB or sigC knock-out strain was different from that of glnB, glnA, sigE, or amt1 (Fig. 3E). The level of the glnN transcript was increased about 1.8- and 1.5-fold in the sigB and sigC knock-out strains, respectively, in the log phase. In contrast, the level was reduced about 25% in the sigB and sigE knock-out strains during the stationary phase and both phases, respectively. Muro-Pastor et al. (15Muro-Pastor A.M. Herrero A. Flores E. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1090-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) reported that SigE contributes to glnN expression under nitrogen-deprived conditions.

Clyne C. Speed C. Rubin G. Bulun S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 949: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This approach would potentially obviate total estrogen deprivation and may still be as effective as the currently used aromatase inhibitors.Aromatase P450 catalyzes the conversion of C19 steroids to estrogens in a number of human cells and tissues, e.g. ovarian granulosa cell and skin and adipose fibroblasts, placental syncytiotrophoblast, bone, and the brain (10McNatty K.P.

P450arom expression in the adipose tissues is limited to undifferentiated fibroblasts and is not detected in significant quantities in the fully differentiated and lipid-filled adipocytes (10McNatty K.P. Baird D.T. Bolton A. Chambers P. Corker C.S. MacLean H. J. Endocrinol. 1976; 71: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 11Ackerman G.E. Smith M.E. Mendelson C.R. MacDonald P.C.

Aromatase activity in adipose fibroblasts has long been implicated in the pathophysiology of breast cancer growth (13Hemsell D.L. Grodin J.M. Brenner P.F. Siiteri P.K. MacDonald P.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1974; 38: 476-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 14James V.H.T. Reed M.J. Lai L.C. Ghilchik M.W. Tait G.H. Newton C.J. Coldham N.G. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Price T.M. Mahendroo M.S. Aitken J. Simpson E.R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 77: 1622-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Estrogen produced in breast adipose tissue acts locally to promote the growth of breast carcinomas (17Yue W. Wang J.P. Hamilton C.J. Demers L.M. Santen R.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 927-932PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the relationship between adipose stroma and breast cancer is unique in that the adipose fibroblasts provide structural and functional support for cancer growth. O'Neill et al. demonstrated that the breast quadrant displaying the highest level of aromatase activity was consistently involved with tumor (15O'Neill J.S. Elton R.A. Miller W.R. Br. Med. J. 1988; 296: 741-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we found that the highest levels of P450arom transcripts in adipose tissue from the quadrants bearing a tumor (12Price T. Aitken J. Head J. Mahendroo M.S. Means G.D. Simpson E.R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1992; 74: 1247-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The clinical relevance of these observations has been exemplified by the fact that aromatase inhibitors are now the most commonly used noncytotoxic drugs in the treatment of breast cancer.Expression of P450arom is under the control of several distinct and partially tissue-specific promoters. The coding region of aromatase transcripts and thus the translated protein, however, are identical in each tissue site of expression (18Mahendroo M.S. Mendelson C.R. Simpson E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19463-19470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Zhao Y. Mendelson C.R. Simpson E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 340-349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Three of these promoters (I.4, I.3, and II) are used in adipose tissue. In disease-free breast adipose tissue, P450arom is usually expressed at low levels via a distal promoter (I.4), whereas in the adipose tissue of the breast bearing a tumor, P450arom expression is increased through the activation of two proximal promoters, II and I.3, which are within the 0.7-kb region upstream to the common splice junction in the coding exon II (20Agarwal V.R.

Biol. 1997; 61: 175-184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Because the activation of promoters I.3 and II is the critical molecular event responsible for the aberrant up-regulation of P450arom expression and thus local estrogen biosynthesis in breast tissues bearing a tumor, the possibility is presented then that promoter-specific inhibitors of P450arom could be developed to be used in the treatment of breast cancer.There may be multiple potential mechanisms responsible for the activation of promoters II and I.3 in human breast adipose fibroblasts (BAFs). Treatment of BAFs in serum-free medium with a cAMP analogue (e.g. Bt2cAMP) switches the promoter use to II and I.3 (18Mahendroo M.S. Mendelson C.R. Simpson E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19463-19470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Zhao Y. Mendelson C.R. Simpson E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 340-349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Zhou D. Chen S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 371: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The stimulation of promoters II/I.3 by cAMP is potentiated by PDA, a protein kinase C activator (18Mahendroo M.S. Mendelson C.R. Simpson E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19463-19470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Simpson and co-workers (24Zhao Y. Agarwal V.R. Mendelson C.R. Simpson E.R. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5739-5742Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) had also identified prostaglandin E2 as a potent factor that stimulates aromatase expression via promoters II/I.3. Prostaglandin E2 acts via E-prostanoid-2 (EP2) and EP1 receptor subtypes to stimulate both protein kinases A and C, respectively, and gives rise to strikingly high levels of promoter I.3- and II-specific P450arom transcripts (24Zhao Y. Agarwal V.R. Mendelson C.R. Simpson E.R. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5739-5742Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). We and others had demonstrated that incubation of BAFs with malignant breast epithelial cell-conditioned medium induced aromatase expression via the activation of promoters I.3 and II (25Zhou J. Gurates B. Yang S. Sebastian S. Bulun S.E. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2328-2334PubMed Google Scholar, 26Harada N. Honda S. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1998; 49: S15-S21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most recently, we demonstrated that malignant breast epithelial cell-conditioned medium (MCM) activated these promoters via a cAMP-independent pathway (25Zhou J. Gurates B. Yang S. Sebastian S. Bulun S.E. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2328-2334PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of tumor-conditioned medium appeared to be mediated by enhanced binding of transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)β to an NF-IL6 site (–317/–304) in the promoter I.3/II region (25Zhou J. Gurates B. Yang S. Sebastian S. Bulun S.E. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2328-2334PubMed Google Scholar).The factors secreted by malignant epithelial cells in MCM have not been identified yet (25Zhou J. Gurates B. Yang S. Sebastian S. Bulun S.E. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2328-2334PubMed Google Scholar). A mixture of factors in MCM seems to function in a redundant fashion to activate aromatase promoters I.3/II (25Zhou J. Gurates B. Yang S. Sebastian S. Bulun S.E. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2328-2334PubMed Google Scholar). We use MCM as a pathophysiologically relevant treatment, whereas Bt2cAMP + PDA is also employed as a surrogate hormonal treatment to mimic the downstream effects of MCM.Sodium butyrate (NaBu) is a four-carbon fatty acid, which is produced naturally in millimolar quantities during digestion by anaerobic bacteria in the cecum and colon (27McIntyre A. Young G.P. Taranto T. Gibson P.R. Ward P.B. Gastroenterology. 1991; 101: 1274-1281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). NaBu exerts potent positive effects on growth arrest and cell differentiation and induces apoptosis in vitro in various malignant tumor cell lines, including breast cancer cell lines (28Weidle U.H. Grossmann A. Anticancer Res. 2000; 20: 1471-1485PubMed Google Scholar). Its therapeutic potential in experimental cancer models in mice had also been well documented, and some derivatives of NaBu had been clinically evaluated in a phase I study after oral administration in patients with solid tumors (28Weidle U.H. Grossmann A. Anticancer Res. 2000; 20: 1471-1485PubMed Google Scholar, 29Gore S.D. Carducci M.A. Exp. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2000; 9: 2923-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). NaBu has been shown to inhibit histone deacetylase activity and induce histone hyperacetylation (30Sowa Y. Sakai T. Nippon Eiseigaku Zasshi. 2003; 58: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). NaBu is also a potent inducer of a serine-threonine phosphatase (31Cuisset L. Tichonicky L. Jaffray P. Delpech M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24148-24153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The mechanism responsible for the anti-neoplastic activity of NaBu, however, has not been well understood to date.We used a model whereby NaBu was added to primary BAFs under various conditions to understand the molecular mechanism responsible for regulating aromatase expression from cancer-associated promoters II and I.3. We report here that the effects of NaBu on aromatase expression in breast tumor fibroblasts are mediated, at least in part, by a reduced phosphorylated state of ATF-2 at threonine 71 (Thr-71) and, consequently, disruption of a transcriptional complex containing phosphorylated ATF-2 (Thr-71), C/EBPβ, and CREB-binding protein (CBP) at the promoter II/I.3 regulatory region.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Cultures—Human adipose tissue samples were obtained at the time of surgery from women (n = 28) undergoing reduction mammoplasty following a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board for Human Research of Northwestern University, Chicago. For primary human BAF cultures, adipose tissues were minced and digested with collagenase B (1 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 2 h. Single-cell suspensions were prepared by filtration through a 75-μm sieve. Fresh cells were suspended in DMEM/F-12 containing 10% FBS in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Twelve to 24 h after the attachment of fibroblasts, culture medium was changed at 48-h intervals until the cells became confluent. At confluence, the cells were placed in serum-free medium for 24 h to wash out the effects of serum and then maintained in serum-free DMEM/F-12 conditioned by MCF-7 breast cancer cells (MCF-7-conditioned medium, MCM) or DMEM/F-12 containing various pharmacologic agents for varying intervals as depicted in relevant figures.We have employed human BAFs in primary culture since 1993 in this laboratory for studies related to regulation of aromatase expression (16Bulun S.E.

The cultured cells yield reproducible results for aromatase expression and do not demonstrate any significant subject-to-subject variation. Nevertheless, we repeated each experiment illustrated in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 in cells from 3 to 6 different subjects and recorded reproducible results.

A, PCR yields of promoter II- or I.3-specific P450arom transcripts showed linear increases in parallel to PCR amplification cycles using RNA from BAFs incubated in the presence or absence of MCM. B, both MCM and Bt2cAMP plus PDA stimulated P450arom transcript levels via activation of promoters II and I.3. The addition of NaBu strikingly decreased P450arom transcript levels via silencing of promoters II/I.3 but not I.4. The increase in I.4-specific transcript levels in response to NaBu did not give rise to a significant increase in total P450arom transcript levels as measured by amplification of the common coding region. After reaching confluence, BAFs were placed in serum-free medium for 24 h to remove the effects of serum. BAFs were then incubated under various conditions for a total of 48 h. Control, DMEM/F-12 only; NaBu, DMEM/F-12 + NaBu (15 mm); MCM, MCF-7 cell-conditioned medium; MCM + NaBu, MCM + NaBu (15 mm); Bt2cAMP + PDA, DMEM/F-12 + Bt2cAMP (0.5 mm) + PDA (100 nm); Bt2cAMP + PDA + NaBu, DMEM/F-12+ Bt2cAMP (0.5 mm) + PDA (100 nm) + NaBu (15 mm); no RT, no reverse transcriptase reaction mixture added as a negative control.

EMSA was performed using an oligonucleotide probe (–214/–192 bp) containing the –211/–199-bp CRE, 1 μg of nuclear extract (NE) from BAFs incubated with MCM or MCM plus NaBu (15 mm), and antibodies against nonphospho-specific ATF-2 or phosphorylated ATF-2 at Thr-71 (pATF-2). We identified a specific complex as verified by a cold competitor probe. The complex had a similar size in BAFs treated with MCM in the presence or absence of NaBu. Antibodies against ATF-2 (nonphospho-specific) or pATF-2 depleted the complex in BAFs treated with MCM, indicating the presence of nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated ATF-2 in this complex. On the other hand, the complex in BAFs treated with MCM plus NaBu was depleted only by the anti-ATF-2 antibody (nonphospho-specific) indicating the absence of phosphorylated ATF-2 in the complex.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 7Binding of phosphorylated ATF-2 (Thr-71), C/EBPβ, and CBP to promoter I.3/II regulatory region in BAFs is enhanced by MCM and abolished by NaBu. Findings depicted in Fig. 6 suggested that MCM increased and NaBu decreased the phosphorylated state of ATF-2 that occupies a CRE in the promoter I.3/II region. We confirm these observations by ChIP, and we also demonstrate that pATF-2 likely stabilizes a complex composed of pATF-2, C/EBPβ, and CBP at this promoter region. BAFs were maintained in serum-free DMEM/F-12 for 24 h and then incubated under various conditions for a total of 36 h (no treatment, DMEM/F-12 only; NaBu, DMEM/F-12 + NaBu (15 mm); MCM, MCF-7 cell-conditioned medium; MCM + NaBu, MCM + NaBu (15 mm)). Treatments lasted for 12 h. For the treatment with MCM plus NaBu, NaBu was added 24 h prior to the addition of MCM, and incubation in MCM plus NaBu lasted for another 12 h. Cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde followed by immunoprecipitation using various antibodies. A, anti-histone H3 and normal rabbit IgG were used as positive and negative controls for the ChIP assay, respectively. We amplified by PCR the –511/–194-bp sequence in the P450arom promoter II/I.3 regulatory region (see Fig. 1). The intensities of PCR fragments correlate with the in situ binding affinities of these factors to the –511/–194-bp region. Both MCM and NaBu increased the quantities of acetylated histones, which were detected by both anti-acetylated histone H3/H4 and anti-acetylated lysine antibodies. In contrast to acetylated histone H3/H4, binding affinities of phosphorylated ATF-2 (Thr-71), C/EBPβ, and CBP to the promoter II/I.3 regulatory region were specifically enhanced by MCM and inhibited by NaBu. On the other hand, binding affinities of factors that could be immunoprecipitated by a nonphospho-specific ATF-2 was not altered by these treatments.

https://openalex.org/W2095353203,"P-Rex1 is a specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rac, which is present in high abundance in brain and hematopoietic cells. P-Rex1 is dually regulated by phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate and the Gβγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. We examined which of the multiple G protein α and βγ subunits activate P-Rex1-mediated Rac guanine nucleotide exchange using pure, recombinant proteins reconstituted into synthetic lipid vesicles. AlF–4 activated Gs,Gi,Gq,G12, or G13 α subunits were unable to activate P-Rex1. Gβγ dimers containing Gβ1–4 complexed with γ2 stimulated P-Rex1 activity with EC50 values ranging from 10 to 20 nm. Gβ5γ2 was not able to stimulate P-Rex1 GEF activity. Dimers containing the β1 subunit complexed with a panel of different Gγ subunits varied in their ability to stimulate P-Rex1. The β1γ3, β1γ7, β1γ10, and β1γ13HA dimers all activated P-Rex1 with EC50 values ranging from 20 to 38 nm. Dimers composed of β1γ12 had lower EC50 values (∼112 nm). The farnesylated γ11 subunit is highly expressed in hematopoietic cells; surprisingly, dimers containing this subunit (β1γ11) were also less effective at activating P-Rex1. These findings suggest that the composition of the Gβγ dimer released by receptor activation may differentially activate P-Rex1.

Chemotaxis is a complex process that involves the functional coordination of a diverse array of proteins to produce cellular movement via rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton (5Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). The activation of Rac, a small G protein, is a key step in chemotaxis (6Schmidt A. Hall M.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 305-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Rac is a member of the Rho subfamily of small G proteins. Like the other small G proteins, Rac is a binary switch that is inactive in the GDP bound state and active in the GTP bound state. The GDP to GTP exchange activity of Rac is regulated by at least three groups of proteins: GDP dissociation inhibitors, GTPase activating proteins, and GEFs (guanine nucleotide exchange factors). GDP dissociation inhibitors stabilize the GDP bound state of Rac, whereas GTPase activating proteins enhance the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rac. Although Rac activation can occur as a result of inhibition of GDP dissociation inhibitors and/or GTPase activating proteins, the stimulation of Rac-GEFs is thought to be the most biologically important mode of Rac activation (1Welch H.C. Coadwell W.J. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The P-Rex family of proteins is a recently identified group of Rac-GEFs that has been shown to be dually modulated by the G protein β1γ2 subunit and the lipid messenger, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) (7Welch H.C.

They are all multimodular proteins containing an N-terminal tandem Dbl homology and pleckstrin homology domains followed by two DEP and two PDZ domains (7Welch H.C. Coadwell W.J. Ellson C.D.

P-Rex1 and P-Rex2a also contain an inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase (InsPx 4-phosphatase) domain that is not present in P-Rex2b; however, neither of these proteins demonstrates inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase activity (7Welch H.C. Coadwell W.J. Ellson C.D. Ferguson G.J. Andrews S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R.

P-Rex proteins apparently serve as a link between phospholipid and G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling and act as coincidence detectors for signals arising from these two pathways (10Weiner O.D. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R429-R431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The activation of GPCRs leads to the release of Gβγ subunits, which have been shown to activate the p110-β and p110-γ isoforms of PtdIns 3-kinase leading to the production of PIP3 in hematopoietic cells such as neutrophils (11Stephens L.R. Eguinoa A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Cooke F. Coadwell J. Smrcka A.S. Thelen M. Cadwallader K. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T.

Therefore, the stimulation of GPCRs in hematopoietic cells leads to the production of both activators of P-Rex1. Although the specific GPCR(s) responsible for P-Rex1 activation in hematopoietic cells has not been identified, the stimulation of Gi-coupled receptors expressed in neutrophils, such as the fMet-Leu-Phe receptor, is likely to lead to the activation of P-Rex1 via the liberation of Gβγ subunits. However, an unanswered question is: does the composition of the Gβγ dimer released upon receptor activation differentially stimulate P-Rex1? This issue is of central importance as it has become apparent that not all Gβγ subunits are equivalent at interacting with receptors or effectors. For example, there are large differences in the ability of certain isoforms of the Gβγ dimer to couple the β-adrenergic and the adenosine A2a receptors to the Gs α subunit (14McIntire W.E. MacCleery G. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15801-15809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), the α2-adrenergic receptor to the Gi α subunit (15Richardson M.

Myung C.S. Garrison J.C. Neubig R.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10532-10541Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).

Nature. 2003; 424: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and the β5γ2 dimer inhibits the muscarinic K+ channel (Kir3), whereas dimers containing the β1–4 subunits activate the K+ channel (19Lei Q.

Therefore, we undertook a study to test the ability of a panel of Gβγ dimers to activate P-Rex1.

Briefly, the cells were harvested 60–80 h post-infection by centrifugation at 100 × g. All cell pellets were washed three times in insect cell phosphate-buffered saline (IPBS: 7.3 mm NaH2PO4, pH 6.2, 58 mm KCl, 47 mm NaCl, 5.0 mm CaCl2) and re-suspended in an ice-cold buffer composed of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol supplemented with a mixture of freshly prepared protease inhibitors (aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin (at 2 μg/ml), benzamidine at 20 μg/ml, and Pefabloc SC Plus at 100 μg/ml) and frozen at –80 °C until use. Preparation of the EE-antibody Column—The hybridoma for the EE-epitope antibody was a gift of Dr. Gernot Walter at the University of California, San Diego (37Grussenmeyer T. Scheidtmann K.H. Hutchinson M.A. Eckhart W. Walter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7952-7954Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and the EE-antibody was produced at the core hybridoma facility of the University of Virginia. The mouse monoclonal EE-antibody was dialyzed against three changes of borate saline (30 mm boric acid, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.8), concentrated using an Amicon Ultra 30 concentrator, and stored at –20 °C at a concentration of ∼3 mg/ml, as determined by A280 (A280 = 1.5 for 1 mg/ml). Cyanogen bromide-activated agarose (CNBr-agarose) was prepared as follows: 1 g of CNBr-agarose was swollen and washed in 250 ml of 1 mm HCl for 15–30 min. About 3.5 ml of swollen resin was washed with 10–20 ml of borate saline prior to the addition of 3 ml of concentrated EE-antibody. The resin and antibody were incubated overnight at 4 °C with constant agitation. After the incubation, the resin was collected by centrifugation at 8–10 × g and the supernatant discarded. The resin was then incubated for 2 h in 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0 (2 ml per ml of resin), washed twice with 10–20 ml of borate saline, and stored in borate saline containing 0.02% sodium azide at 4 °C until further use. Purification of P-Rex1—Sf9 cells were infected for 60–80 h with the P-Rex1 virus and harvested via low speed centrifugation. The cells were lysed by nitrogen cavitation at 700 p.s.i. for 20–30 min in a buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors. The cell lysate (60 ml) was centrifuged at 1,000 × g and 100,000 × g prior to the cytosol (60 ml) being loaded onto a 1-ml EE antibody-agarose column by gravity flow. To purify the protein, the EE column was washed with 10 ml of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, and 1% Triton, followed by a 10-ml wash with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA. P-Rex1 was eluted in 1-ml fractions with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, and 0.4 mg/ml EE peptide (CEEEEYMPME). The EE-P-Rex1 prepared using this protocol is highly pure as demonstrated in Fig. 1A. Approximately 2–3 ml of 0.4–0.8 μg/ml P-Rex1 was obtained from 500 ml of Sf9 culture. Purification of Rac—The recombinant GST-Rac1 (Rac) protein was purified using a GST resin per the manufacturer's protocols (Amersham Biosciences). One liter of DH5α bacterial cell culture expressing Rac was harvested and lysed using a French Press in 30 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors. To extract the Rac that was membrane associated, 1% Triton X-100 was added to the cell lysate and incubated on ice for 30 min. The cell lysate was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (30 ml) was collected and incubated with 1 ml of GST resin for at least an hour at 4 °C with constant mixing. After the incubation, the beads were washed twice with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 and three times with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline alone, using low speed centrifugation (3,000 × g for 2 min) and gentle resuspension. The beads containing the last wash were poured into a column and allowed to drain by gravity flow. Rac was eluted off the beads in 1-ml fractions with the following buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 5 mm reduced glutathione. The high purity of the Rac obtained using this method can be seen in Fig. 1B. Approximately, 3 ml of 2–3 mg/ml Rac was obtained from 1 liter of DH5α bacterial culture.

Purification of Gα12 and Gα13 was accomplished using minor variations of the methods of Kozasa (39Kozasa T. Manning D.R. G Proteins, Techniques of Analysis.

For the elution step, G12 buffer was modified by lowering the NaCl and imidazole to 50 and 10 mm, respectively; MgCl2 and GDP were raised to 50 mm and 20 μm, respectively, and 10 mm NaF and 30 μm AlCl3 were added.

RNA 5′-end-directed cleavages represent a form of RNase H activity that is carried out on RNA/DNA hybrids that contain a recessed RNA 5′-end. Previously, the distance from the RNA 5′-end has been considered the primary determinant for the location of these cleavages. Employing model hybrid substrates and the HIV-1 and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptases, we demonstrate that cleavage sites correlate with specific sequences and that the distance from the RNA 5′-end determines the extent of cleavage. An alignment of sequences flanking multiple RNA 5′-end-directed cleavage sites reveals that both enzymes strongly prefer A or U at the +1 position and C or G at the –2 position, and additionally for HIV-1, A is disfavored at the –4 position. For both enzymes, 5′-end-directed cleavages occurred when sites were positioned between the 13th and 20th nucleotides from the RNA 5′-end, a distance termed the cleavage window. In examining the importance of accessibility to the RNA 5′-end, it was found that the extent of 5′-end-directed cleavages observed in substrates containing a free recessed RNA 5′-end was most comparable to substrates with a gap of two or three bases between the upstream and downstream RNAs. Together these finding demonstrate that the selection of 5′-end-directed cleavage sites by retroviral RNases H results from a combination of nucleotide sequence, permissible distance, and accessibility to the RNA 5′-end.

In reverse transcription, the single-stranded RNA genome of a retrovirus is transformed into double-stranded DNA by the viral-encoded reverse transcriptase (reviewed in Refs. 1Arts E.J.

This multifunctional enzyme carries out DNA synthesis, strand displacement synthesis, and strand transfer and degrades the RNA portion of RNA/DNA hybrids. The polymerase domain of reverse transcriptase represents the amino-terminal two-thirds of the protein, whereas the RNase H domain comprises the remaining carboxyl-terminal portion. Although the polymerase and RNase H activities are functionally separable, both activities are essential for retroviral replication.

First, RNase H carries out degradation of the RNA genome both during and after minus-strand DNA synthesis to facilitate plus-strand DNA synthesis and strand transfers. Second, RNase H creates the polypurine tract (PPT) primer from the viral genome. And third, RNase H removes the PPT and tRNA primers used to prime plus-strand and minus-stand DNA synthesis, respectively. Given the vital roles of RNase H in retroviral replication, it is important to understand how RNase H recognizes the RNA/DNA hybrids created during reverse transcription as substrates for cleavage. Extensive studies have shown that both generation of the PPT primer and removal of the PPT and tRNA primers require specific sequences (9Fuentes G.M. Rodriguez-Rodriguez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J.

By contrast, fewer studies have examined general degradation by RNase H (20DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A.

RNase H has both polymerization-dependent and polymerization-independent modes of cleavage. The polymerization-dependent mode accompanies RNA-dependent DNA synthesis, and the nascent DNA 3′ primer terminus positions RNase H cleavages. Such cleavages occur 17–20 nucleotides away on the RNA template strand but are not strictly coupled to DNA synthesis (20DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3793-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 24Furfine E.S. Reardon J.E. J. Biol.

This mode of cleavage likely functions at pause sites during minus-strand synthesis, when the 3′ terminus of the nascent DNA is recessed on the genomic template. However, the polymerization rate of reverse transcriptase is faster than the rate of RNase H cleavage (27Gotte M. Fackler S. Hermann T. Perola E. Cellai L. Gross H.J. Le Grice S.F. Heumann H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 833-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and the polymerization-dependent mode of RNase H cleavage does not completely degrade the template RNA (20DeStefano J.J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 13061-13070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and removal of these fragments by the polymerization-independent RNase H activity is likely necessary for efficient plus-strand DNA synthesis. Polymerization-independent RNase H cleavages have been attributed to at least three distinct mechanisms, which differ in how reverse transcriptase associates with the hybrid substrate (reviewed in Refs. 1Arts E.J.

Second, the polymerase domain can bind a recessed DNA 3′ primer terminus to facilitate DNA 3′-end-directed cleavages that occur ∼17–20 nucleotides back on the RNA strand of a hybrid, similar to what happens at pause sites during polymerization. Third, the polymerase domain can associate with a recessed RNA 5′-end, and RNase H can carry out 5′-end-directed cleavages that occur ∼15–20 nucleotides downstream on the RNA strand. While the distance from the recessed RNA 5′-end has been characterized as the primary determinant for this mechanism (29DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4330-4338Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), these cleavages have been observed as close as 12–15 nucleotides (30Fu T.B. Taylor J. J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3901-3908Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) from the RNA 5′-end. Notably, this range of distances is much broader than the more fixed distance of 17–19 nucleotides that separates the polymerase and RNase H active sites as determined by crystallography studies or footprinting of reverse transcriptase with substrates (33Huang H.

A limited number of studies has suggested the possibility that sequence might influence 5′-end-directed cleavages (24Furfine E.S. Reardon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 406-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A.

Virol. 1992; 66: 4271-4278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but this hypothesis has not been directly tested before. We recently reported that sequence specificity is an important determinant of internal RNase H cleavages and that an RNA 5′-end at a nick does not promote 5′-end-directed RNase H cleavages (23Schultz S.J. Zhang M. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 635-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These results prompted us to ask three fundamental questions concerning RNA 5′-end-directed cleavages by retroviral RNases H. First, does sequence influence 5′-end-directed cleavages? Second, what distances from the RNA 5′-end are acceptable for 5′-end-directed cleavage sites? Third, how large of a gap is required between the 3′ terminus of an upstream RNA and the 5′-end of a downstream RNA to allow efficient 5′-end-directed cleavages in the downstream RNA? Our findings offer new insights into the mechanisms of RNA 5′-end-directed cleavages for M-MuLV and HIV-1 reverse transcriptases, and the role of RNase H in retroviral replication. Enzymes and Reagents—Recombinant HIV-1 reverse transcriptase was obtained from Worthington Biochemicals. Recombinant wild-type M-MuLV reverse transcriptase, T7 DNA polymerase, and calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. T4 polynucleotide kinase, T4 DNA ligase, T4 DNA polymerase, and all restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs. DNA oligonucleotides were obtained from Qiagen and Invitrogen. Oligonucleotides were gel-purified in denaturing polyacrylamide gels as described (23Schultz S.J. Zhang M. Champoux J.J. J. Mol.

Preparation of RNAs—Preparation of RNAs Md1-Md10, PPT20, PPT62, and NPPT has been described previously (23Schultz S.J. Zhang M. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 635-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To prepare R46 RNA, a 46-mer DNA oligonucleotide (5′-CAATGAAAGACCCCACCTGTAGGTTTGGCAAGCTAGCTTCGAGACG-3′) was annealed to a 54-mer DNA oligonucleotide (5′-AATTCGTCTCGAAGCTAGCTTGCCAAACCTACAGGTGGGGTCTTTCATTGAGCT-3′), and this duplex was introduced into EcoRI- and SacI-linearized pGEM9Zf(–) (Promega). The resulting plasmid was linearized with BsmBI and transcribed in vitro as described (23Schultz S.J. Zhang M. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 635-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All other RNAs were prepared by in vitro transcription of linearized plasmids as follows. To make 35-mer R7Z1, pGEM7Zf(+) (Promega) was linearized with XbaI. To make 28-mer R9Z1, pGEM9Zf(–) was linearized with XbaI. To make 32-mer RpKS1, pBluescript KSII(+) (Stratagene) was linearized with NotI. To make 30-mer R3Z1, pGEM3Zf(–) (Promega) was linearized with BamHI.

To generate additional RNAs with different sequences, some pGEM plasmids were digested with single-cutting restriction enzymes downstream of the T7 promoter (as indicated below), the overhangs were filled in or removed by T4 DNA polymerase treatment, the blunt ends were ligated using T4 DNA ligase, and the resulting plasmids were transformed into XL1-Blue cells (Stratagene). The sequences of these plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For T4 DNA polymerase treatment, a digested plasmid was incubated in a 20-μl reaction containing 1 mm dNTPs and 3 units of T4 DNA polymerase for 5 min at 37 °C and then for 15 min at 12 °C. To make 25-mer R3Z2, pGEM3Zf(–) was digested by EcoRI and BamHI, and the resulting plasmid was linearized with HindIII prior to in vitro transcription. To make 27-mer R7Z2, pGEM7Zf(+) was digested by ApaI, treated with T4 DNA polymerase, ligated, digested with AatII, treated with T4 DNA polymerase, and ligated, and then the resulting plasmid was linearized with XbaI. To make 32-mer R7Z3, pGEM7Zf(+) was digested by ApaI and XbaI, and the resulting plasmid was linearized with Acc65I. To make 30-mer R7Z4, pGEM7Zf(+) was digested by ApaI and EcoRI, and the resulting plasmid was linearized with BstBI. To make 30-mer R7Z5, pGEM7Zf(+) was digested by ApaI and SmaI, and the resulting plasmid was linearized with HindIII. 5′-End Labeling, 3′-End Labeling, and 5′-End Phosphorylation—5′-End labeling or 3′-end labeling of RNAs were carried out as described previously (23Schultz S.J. Zhang M. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 635-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 37Schultz S.J. Zhang M. Champoux J.J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5275-5285Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because cleavage by RNase H produces a 3′-hydroxyl group and a 5′-phosphate group, an unlabeled phosphate group was added to the 5′-ends of 3′-end-labeled RNAs as previously described (23Schultz S.J. Zhang M. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 635-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Preparation of Hybrid Substrates—To prepare the substrate without upstream RNA (No Upstream substrate), RNAs were annealed to the appropriate template DNAs at an RNA:DNA molar ratio of 1:2, and to prepare the Nick or Gap substrates, upstream PPT20 RNA was additionally included at a 3-fold molar excess over the first RNA. Annealings were carried out in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 200 mm KCl at 90 °C for 3 min followed by cooling to room temperature. For the No Upstream substrates, the RNA 5′-end was recessed by 22 nucleotides from the DNA 3′-end and the RNA 3′-end extended two bases beyond the DNA 5′-end. Hybrids containing RNAs Md1, Md2, Md4, Md6, Md7, Md9, and Md10 were annealed to DNA strands D49, D49Δ1, D49Δ3, D49Δ5, D49Δ6, D49Δ8, and D49Δ9, respectively (23Schultz S.J. Zhang M. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 635-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Hybrids containing RNAs R3Z1, R3Z2, R7Z1, R7Z2, R7Z3, R7Z4, R7Z5, R9Z1, R46, and RpKS2 were similarly positioned on DNA strands containing the appropriate complementary sequences. RNA NPPT was annealed to D52N (23Schultz S.J. Zhang M. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 635-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and PPT62 was annealed to D+27temp4 (23Schultz S.J. Zhang M. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 635-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For the Nick substrate containing upstream PPT20 and downstream Md1, the template strand was D49 (5′-CCAAACCTACAGGTGGGGTCTTTCATTT[]CCCCCCTTTTTCTGGAGACTAA-3′). The brackets in the sequence of D49 indicate the position that nucleotides were added to create the template strands for the corresponding Gap substrates, which are D49(1b) (5′...[T]...3′), D49(2b) (5′...[GT]...3′), D49(3b) (5′... [AGT]... 3′), D49(4b) (5′... [CAGT]... 3′), and D49(5b) (5′... [ACAGT]...3′). For the Nick substrate containing upstream PPT20 and downstream Md10, the template strand was D49Δ9 (5′-GCTAGCTTGCCAAACCTACAGGTGGGG[]CCCCCCTTTTTCTGGAGACTAA-3′). The brackets in the sequence of D49Δ9 indicate the position that nucleotides were added to create the template strands for the corresponding Gap substrates, which are D49Δ9(1b) (5′... [T]... 3′), D49Δ9(2b) (5′... [GT]... 3′), D49Δ9(3b) (5′... [AGT]... 3′), D49Δ9(4b) (5′... [CAGT]...3′), and D49Δ9(5b) (5′... [ACAGT]...3′). Cleavage Analysis of Hybrid Substrates—Three units (0.6–0.8 pmol) of M-MuLV reverse transcriptase or 0.5 unit (0.2 pmol) of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase were incubated with 0.2 pmol (10 nm final concentration) of a hybrid substrate in 20-μl reactions containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for the times indicated. Aliquots were added to formamide stop mix (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA) and electrophoresed in denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gels (National Diagnostics). Products were visualized by PhosphorImager analysis (Amersham Biosciences). Statistical Analysis—For each position of the aligned sequences, the chi-square one-dimensional test was used to determine the deviation from the random distribution of bases (44Capranico G. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6611-6619Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The expected frequency for each base was determined by summing the nucleotide frequencies of the first 25 nucleotides from the 5′-end of each RNA used for HIV-1 (Fig. 5) and for M-MuLV (Fig. 6). For HIV-1, the expected frequencies were A = 0.233, C = 0.243, G = 0.319, and U = 0.205. For M-MuLV, the expected frequencies were A = 0.220, C = 0.251, G = 0.326, and U = 0.203.FIGURE 6Alignment of sequences flanking RNA 5′-end-directed cleavage sites recognized by M-MuLV RNase H. The sequences are presented as described in the legend to Fig. 5. Cleavage sites mapped using RNAs in this study are described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Quantitative Analysis of RNase H Cleavage Products—Band intensities of cleavage products were determined using ImageQuanT (Amersham Biosciences). To compare the amount of product resulting from cleavage at the same sequence in different RNAs (for example, counting from the RNA 5′-end, site F is cleaved in Md1 between the 16th and 17th nucleotides, and in Md2 between the 15th and 16th nucleotides), the area integration function was used to quantitate the relative abundance of individual bands present in each sample. This analysis normalized the amount of cleavage product for a specific site as a percentage of the total cleavage products for each hybrid substrate. Quantitations using data from the 15-s and 1-min time points were found to be essentially identical, and the results from 1-min time points are presented graphically in Fig. 4. Sequence and Distance Are Determinants of RNA 5′-End-directed Cleavages—The 5′-end-directed cleavages by RNase H have been shown to occur 15–20 nucleotides from the RNA 5′-end. To address how RNase H cleaves at specific sites within this range, we have evaluated the roles of RNA sequence, distance, and accessibility to the RNA 5′-end as possible determinants of cleavage. As a model system, hybrid substrates with RNAs containing sequence from the M-MuLV PPT region were used. In this region of the M-MuLV genome, the cleavage that generates the 3′-end of the PPT primer is defined to occur between nucleotides –1 and +1 and is called the –1/+1 cleavage site. This numbering is also used to designate the positions of nucleotides in the model hybrid substrates, which contained 7 different 29-mer RNAs, termed Md1 through Md10 (Fig. 1). These RNAs have 5′-ends beginning downstream of the PPT at positions +1, +2, +4, +6, +7, +9, or +10 and contain a total of 29 consecutive nucleotides of sequence, such that blocks of the same sequence are located at different distances from the RNA 5′-ends (shaded box in Fig. 1). These RNAs were used to ask if 5′-end-directed cleavages occur at identical distances from the RNA 5′-ends and if sequence influences the positioning of 5′-end-directed cleavages. For RNase H cleavage assays, each RNA was 5′- or 3′-end-labeled and annealed to a template DNA to generate a hybrid with a recessed RNA 5′-end. Hybrid substrates were incubated with HIV-1 or M-MuLV reverse transcriptase in time-course assays; the products representing the initial 5′-end-directed cleavage events were found in the 15-s and 1-min time points when most of the initial substrate remained uncleaved. These initial cleavage sites were mapped by comparing the mobilities of cleavage products to size ladders generated with nuclease P1 (data not shown). Depending upon whether an RNA was 5′- or 3′-end-labeled, the longest products represented the cleavages that occur the furthest from or the closest to the RNA 5′-end, respectively. Importantly, the location and extent of cleavage for each site were determined by using the data obtained for both 5′- and 3′-end-labeled RNAs. To facilitate comparison of the same sites in different substrates, the cleavage sites generating the observed products have been named A through I, as indicated in the relevant figures and as described previously (23Schultz S.J. Zhang M. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 635-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). When substrates containing 5′-end-labeled RNAs Md1 through Md10 were treated with HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, it was immediately apparent that the cleavage products were not of uniform size (Fig. 2A). Instead, the products had varied lengths indicating that cleavages occurred at different distances from the RNA 5′-ends. The expected products resulting from cleavage at the same sites in the different substrates (labeled “E–I”) are connected by lines in Fig. 2. Substrate Md1 was predominantly cleaved at sites E, F, and G (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–5). Counting from the RNA 5′-end, site E is between nucleotides 13 and 14, site F is between nucleotides 16 and 17, and site G, which represented the most distal 5′-end-directed cleavage site in Md1, falls between nucleotides 19 and 20. Cleavage of substrate Md2 was very similar to that of substrate Md1 except that all of the cleavage products were one nucleotide smaller (lanes 6–10). Importantly, site G remained the most distal 5′-end-directed cleavage, even though this site was now located between the 18th and 19th nucleotides from the Md2 RNA 5′-end, and, unlike Md1, no cleavage occurred between the 19th and 20th nucleotides. Although site H was not cleaved in Md1 or Md2, this site was detectably cleaved between the 19th and 20th nucleotides in substrate Md4 (lanes 11–15) and significantly cleaved between the 17th and 18th nucleotides in substrate Md6 (lanes 16–20). No cleavage was observed at site I in substrates Md1 through Md7 (lanes 1–25), but this site was cleaved when located between the 19th and 20th nucleotides in substrate Md9 and between the 18th and 19th nucleotides in substrate Md10 (lanes 25–35). Assays with 3′-end-labeled RNAs and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase were used to confirm that the 5′-end-directed cleavages sites closest to the RNA 5′-ends in the above analysis represented the initial cleavage products and were not the result of secondary cleavages (Fig. 2B). In general, the locations were the same as for the 5′-end-labeled substrates, but the relative abundance of products sometimes varied because strong cleavage sites close to the labeled end diminished the detection of more distal sites. Site E was cleaved well in substrate Md1 at the earliest time points but was only weakly cleaved in subsequent substrates (lanes 1–20). Site F was a strong cleavage site when located as close as between the 13th and 14th nucleotides from the R"
https://openalex.org/W2048489624,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a plasminogen-like protein with an α chain linked to a trypsin-like β chain without peptidase activity. The interaction of HGF with c-met, a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed by many cells, is important in cell growth, migration, and formation of endothelial and epithelial tubes. Stimulation of c-met requires two-chain, disulfide-linked HGF. Portions of an α chain containing an N-terminal segment and four kringle domains (NK4) antagonize HGF activity. Until now, no physiological pathway for generating NK4 was known. Here we show that chymases, which are chymotryptic peptidases secreted by mast cells, hydrolyze HGF, thereby abolishing scatter factor activity while generating an NK4-like antagonist of HGF scatter factor activity. Thus, chymase interferes with HGF directly by destroying active protein and indirectly by generating an antagonist. The site of hydrolysis, Leu480, lies in the α chain on the N-terminal side of the cysteine linking the α and β chains. This site appears to be specific for HGF because chymase does not hydrolyze other plasminogen-like proteins, such as macrophage-stimulating protein and plasminogen itself. Mast cell/neutrophil cathepsin G and neutrophil elastase generate similar fragments of HGF by cleaving near the chymase site. Mast cell and neutrophil peptidases are secreted during tissue injury, infection, ischemia, and allergic inflammation, where they may oppose HGF effects on epithelial repair. Thus, HGF possesses an “inactivation segment” that serves as an Achilles' heel attacked by inflammatory proteases.

Mature HGF is a disulfide-linked, heterodimeric protein related to plasminogen, with α and β chains originating from an inactive, single-chain precursor (see Fig. 1). Although HGF is proteolytically incompetent because of mutations in the peptidase domain, it retains a serine peptidase-like mode of activation by cleavage at Arg494 in the precursor, changing conformation to allow productive binding, dimerization, and activation of its receptor, c-met (15Hartmann G. Naldini L. Weidner K.M. Sachs M. Vigna E. Comoglio P.M. Birchmeier W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11574-11578Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Mature α and β chains of HGF each can bind to c-met, although individually they have little receptor activating ability (15Hartmann G. Naldini L. Weidner K.M. Sachs M. Vigna E. Comoglio P.M. Birchmeier W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11574-11578Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). A fragment of the α chain comprised of the N-terminal hairpin and four kringle domains (NK4) antagonizes c-met-mediated HGF effects, such as scatter factor activity, and also inhibits angiogenesis by independent mechanisms (16Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). NK4 is composed of the first 447 residues (pyrGlu32–Val478 of HGF) of the α chain. NK4 was generated originally by fragmentation with pancreatic elastase, which hydrolyzes HGF at Val478 (17Date K. Matsumoto K. Shimura H. Tanaka M. Nakamura T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Subsequently, recombinant NK4 or NK4-expressing vectors were used to inhibit invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis in tumor models (reviewed in Ref. 16Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). HGF may influence development of mast cells, which like HGF itself are implicated in responses to injury, tissue repair, remodeling, and angiogenesis. Murine mast cell precursors express c-met during in vitro differentiation (18Fehlner-Gardiner C.C. Cao H. Jackson-Boeters L. Nakamura T. Elliott B.E. Uniyal S. Chan B.M. Differentiation. 1999; 65: 27-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and respond to HGF with β1 integrin-mediated migration. By releasing heparin, mast cells may raise circulating HGF after thrombotic events, like myocardial infarction (19Kinoshita M. Miyamoto T. Ohashi N. Sasayama S. Matsumori A. Circulation. 2002; 106: 3133-3138Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Heparin also may be a cofactor in HGF-induced angiogenesis (reviewed in Ref. 8Matsumori A. Cardiovasc. Drugs Ther. 2004; 18: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus, HGF may influence mast cell behavior and vice versa. In this regard, it is notable that secreted products of in vitro differentiated mast cells ablate HGF activity (18Fehlner-Gardiner C.C. Cao H. Jackson-Boeters L. Nakamura T. Elliott B.E. Uniyal S. Chan B.M. Differentiation. 1999; 65: 27-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The present work focuses on major inflammatory cell peptidases, including the human mast cell chymotryptic peptidase, chymase, a mouse enzyme, mast cell protease (MCP)4, with similar tissue distribution and enzymatic properties (20Serafin W.E.

Med. 2003; 198: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and human neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G. Cathepsin G possesses tryptic, chymotryptic, and metase activity (23Polanowska J. Krokoszynska I. Czapinska H. Watorek W. Dadlez M. Otlewski J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1386: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and is expressed by mast cells as well as by neutrophils. Human chymase and cathepsin G are expressed in a subset of mast cells inhabiting the dermis and certain other microenvironments, such as airway submucosa (24Irani A.M. Bradford T.R. Kepley C.L. Schechter N.M. Schwartz L.B. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1989; 37: 1509-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 25Matin R. Tam E.K. Nadel J.A. Caughey G.H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1992; 40: 781-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These enzymes accumulate in secretory granules and are released with other mediators by antigen-bound IgE or other stimuli, such as neuropeptides, anaphylatoxins, and bacterial surface proteins. Elastase and cathepsin G are released by activated neutrophils, where association with the cell surface or with high local concentrations in quantally released granules affords protection from circulating antipeptidases (26Owen C.A. Campbell M.A. Sannes P.L. Boukedes S.S. Campbell E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 775-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 27Campbell E.J. Campbell M.A. Boukedes S.S. Owen C.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, these enzymes are secreted in various types of inflammation. The present work reveals that chymase, cathepsin G, and neutrophil elastase, despite divergent cleavage specificities, hydrolyze HGF in a short but vulnerable inactivation segment, ablating bioactivity and generating an antagonistic fragment. Mast Cell and Leukocyte Peptidases—Recombinant human prochymase was expressed, activated, and purified as described (21Caughey G.H. Raymond W.W. Wolters P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1480: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The concentration of active chymase was determined with the substrate succinyl-l-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-4-nitroanilide as described (21Caughey G.H. Raymond W.W. Wolters P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1480: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Chymase MCP4 was purified from mouse ears and assayed as described (21Caughey G.H. Raymond W.W. Wolters P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1480: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Mast cell β-tryptase was purified from human lung (28Hartmann T. Ruoss S.J. Raymond W.W. Seuwen K. Caughey G.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: L528-L534PubMed Google Scholar). Human neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G were purchased from Elastin Products (Owensville, MO). The molar ratios of elastase and cathepsin G were calculated from protein content and assumed to be fully active. Incubation of Peptidases with HGF, Macrophage-stimulating Protein (MSP), and Plasminogen—HGF and related kringle-rich, plasminogen-like proteins were incubated with peptidases. Human HGF was kindly provided by Genentech (South San Francisco, CA) or was purchased from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ). These preparations are recombinant material expressed in Chinese hamster ovary and insect cells, respectively. Recombinant human MSP was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Plasma-derived human plasminogen, porcine pancreatic elastase, and bovine chymotrypsin were from Sigma. Incubations with proteases were carried out in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, with or without heparin (10 μg/1 μg of HGF; bovine lung, Sigma, catalog number H4898, 150 units/mg), and were stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heating to 70 °C for 10 min. Electrophoresis, Blotting, and N-terminal Sequencing—Results of incubation of HGF, MSP, and plasminogen with chymases were monitored by reducing and non-reducing gradient SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen). Coomassie Blue-stained gels were scanned and analyzed by densitometry. Chymase-generated fragments separated by non-reducing SDS-PAGE were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. Blotted bands of interest were excised and subjected to N-terminal sequencing by Midwest Analytical (St. Louis, MO). Purification and Sequencing of Peptidase-generated Fragments of HGF—Unreduced fragments of HGF arising from incubation with human chymase were loaded onto a 2.1 × 250 mm C4 reverse-phase HPLC column (Alltech, Deerfield, IL) in 5% acetonitrile, 95% H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and eluted with a two-slope gradient of increasing concentrations of acetonitrile in H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The eluted proteins were detected by monitoring of absorbance at 280 nm, collected, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. A purified fragment was coincubated with HGF in the scatter factor assays described below. In separate experiments, chymase-generated fragments of HGF were reduced in 40 mm dithiothreitol, alkylated by incubation in 80 mm iodoacetamide, then separated on the C4 column. The major early eluting peak was collected and further analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectroscopy (Voyager DE-STR, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) at UCSF's Biomolecular Resource Center. The material was further probed by HPLC-linked tandem mass spectroscopy (QSTAR XL, Applied Biosystems). To characterize fragments of HGF generated by neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G, digested products were subjected directly to MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy. Also, to compare the heparin-binding characteristics of HGF and products of chymase-mediated hydrolysis, partial digests were loaded onto a heparin HPLC column (TosoHaas, Montgomeryville, PA) and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.5–2 m NaCl in 10 mm bis-Tris-HCl, pH 6.1. Scatter Factor Activity—To assess the bioactivity of chymase-hydrolyzed HGF, the scatter factor activity of cleaved protein was compared with that of native protein in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell assays (17Date K. Matsumoto K. Shimura H. Tanaka M. Nakamura T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The antagonistic potential of an NK4-like fragment liberated by chymase was assessed in the same assay by incubating the purified fragment with mature, active HGF. Briefly, cells were plated on 6-well culture dishes at 17,000 cells/well 48 h before incubation with HGF. For inhibition studies, cells were preincubated with the NK4-like fragment for 30 min at 37 °C before addition of HGF. After incubation for 18 h, cells were fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde and then washed in 70% ethanol and air-dried for light microscopy. Hydrolysis of HGF by Mast Cell Chymases—As determined by reducing SDS-PAGE prior to incubation with peptidases, the HGF in this study is mature, two-chain HGF mixed with smaller amounts of single-chain pro-HGF. As shown in Fig. 2, human chymase and mouse MCP4 incubated at molar ratios of enzyme:HGF of 1:70 selectively hydrolyze HGF in a time- and heparin-dependant fashion, generating major bands of 30 and 45 kDa. N-terminal sequencing of an unreduced 30-kDa protein reveals two sequences of similar molarity: Val-Val-Asn-Gly-Ile, corresponding to HGF residues 495–499, which is the N terminus of the activated serine peptidase domain, and Asp-His-Pro-Val-Ile, corresponding to residues 481–485 in the proposed inactivation segment (see Fig. 3). These findings indicate that the 30-kDa fragment is a heterodimer comprised of a remnant of the α domain disulfide-linked via Cys487 to intact, activated β (serine peptidase) domain. These data also suggest that the major site of hydrolysis is Leu480. Therefore, the prominent 45-kDa band is an NK4-like protein apparently ending with Leu480, i.e. at the site cleaved by chymase. Based on disappearance of single-chain HGF in digests run on reducing gels (not shown), chymase cleaves pro-HGF as well as the two-chain active form. Co-incubation with heparin modestly accelerates the loss of the HGF parent band. MCP4 activity in the presence of heparin is more selective than in its absence, because faint bands in addition to NK4-like and β+α remnant bands are apparent. However, heparin does not overtly influence selectivity of human chymase.FIGURE 3Identification of cleavage sites and comparison of inactivation segments. A, MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of the major HPLC-purified peptides generated from chymase-cleaved HGF. Peaks representing mono-protonated peptides DHPVISC*AKTKQL (m/z = 1496.80) and DHPVISC*AKTKQLR (m/z = 1652.91) are noted. C*, carbamidomethyl cysteine. The identity of these peptides was validated by tandem mass spectrometry. B, mass spectrum of neutrophil elastase-generated fragments of HGF, including peaks consistent with NLDHPVISC*AKTKQL (m/z 1723.94) and NLDHPVISC*AKTKQLR (m/z 1880.06). With results of SDS-PAGE, these findings suggest that the major site of HGF hydrolysis by chymase and neutrophil elastase is Leu480 and Val478, respectively. C, sequence alignment of seven mammalian HGFs and chicken HGF between residues 451 and 510, which includes the proposed protease-cleaved inactivation and activation segments bracketed by the end of the fourth kringle and beginning of the catalytic domain. Major sites of hydrolysis by elastase and chymase are shown by * and **, respectively. An arrow points to the site of hydrolysis of single-chain HGF by its activator to generate the active, two-chain form, in which the α chain is disulfide-linked to β chain via Cys487. Hydrolysis at any site between the two cysteines (vertical bars), which flank the 17-residue inactivation segment, unlinks α from β and generates a free, NK4-like fragment of α chain. Cleavage within the kringle domain itself does not generate a free fragment because of triple looping via Cys–Cys linkages. Note absolute conservation of the chymase cleavage site. D, compares sequence of human HGF, MSP, and plasminogen (PLG) in the same regions. Note that chymase and elastase hydrolysis sites in the HGF inactivation segment are not conserved in otherwise-homologous MSP and plasminogen.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Hydrolysis of HGF by Other Peptidases—As shown in Fig. 2, neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G hydrolyze HGF with a pattern similar to that of chymase and MCP4, including generation of an NK4-like fragment. Elastase was used in a molar ratio of enzyme:HGF of 1:38. Cathepsin G, which is weaker than chymase toward most substrates, was used in a ratio of 1:5. Chymotrypsin, used in a molar ratio of 1:12, exhibits little activity, consistent with the lack of preferred aromatic residues in the proposed inactivation segment (see Fig. 3). Mast cell tryptase does not cleave HGF (not shown), even after prolonged incubations with molar ratios of enzyme:substrate as high as 1:2. Characterization of Peptidase-generated Fragments by Mass Spectroscopy—To confirm that Leu480 is a site of cleavage by chymase (as suggested by results of N-terminal sequencing of the blotted β+α remnant fragment) and to identify other potential fragments of HGF generated by inflammatory peptidases, we analyzed peptidase-generated products by mass spectroscopy. In the case of the chymase digest, MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy of the purified principal peptide peak confirms Leu480 to be the major site of hydrolysis. Two major fragments co-eluted on the C4 column. One matches the mass of the Asp481-Arg494 segment (see Fig. 3) expected from cleavage at Leu480 of two-chain HGF. The other matches Asp481-Leu493, which is a desArg version of the other fragment. This is consistent with chymase-mediated hydrolysis at Leu480 and Leu493 or with prior removal of Arg494 from a portion of two-chain HGF. As analyzed by the MALDI-TOF approach, elastase generates major peaks matching masses of Asn479-Arg494 and Asn479-Leu493, consistent with the main site of cleavage being Val478, which is also the major site cleaved by pancreatic elastase (17Date K. Matsumoto K. Shimura H. Tanaka M. Nakamura T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 29Matsumoto K. Kataoka H. Date K. Nakamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22913-22920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and is two residues away from the site attacked by chymase. The finding of the desArg form of these peptides in the digests of elastase as well as chymase is consistent with a pre-existing population of two-chain HGF lacking Arg494 generated by a carboxypeptidase during the production of the recombinant enzyme. Cathepsin G, which is less specific than chymase or elastase, generates a variety of small fragments, consistent with hydrolysis at multiple sites within the inactivation segment. Failure of Chymase to Hydrolyze HGF Homologues—As shown in Fig. 2, chymase does not fragment human plasminogen and MSP, which are the other major members of the plasminogen subfamily of kringle-containing proteins with serine peptidase domains. Thus, human chymase sensitivity is specific to HGF among its close relatives. However, MCP4 can cleave human but not mouse plasminogen (not shown), consistent with somewhat differing substrate preferences between human chymase and MCP4. Purification of an NK4-like Protein Generated by Chymase—Fig. 4 shows chromatographic separation and purification of the NK4-like fragment from the β+α remnant fragment. The size disparity of the two peaks is because of a large difference in the extinction coefficient between the two major fragments, which are more nearly equal on a molar basis. The peak 1 protein was used in scatter factor assays, as noted below. Not shown are the results of heparin affinity chromatography, which reveals that chymase-generated NK4-like protein binds much more strongly than the free β chain. This suggests that the heparin affinity of HGF derives principally from the NK4 portion of the α chain. The shared affinity of HGF and chymase for heparin may promote the formation of a ternary complex and accelerate chymase-mediated HGF inactivation and generation of NK4-like protein, as seen in Fig. 2. Effect of Cleavage by Chymase and Incubation with NK4-like Fragment on Cell Scattering Activity of HGF—As shown in Fig. 5, chymase destroys the ability of HGF to alter cell motility and morphology. Furthermore, incubation with the chymase-generated NK4-like fragment fully antagonizes HGF effects on MDCK cells. This antagonism occurs at ratios of NK4-like protein:HGF as low as 250:1. NK4 is shorter than chymase-generated NK4-like protein by two residues. The major proposed sites of hydrolysis involved in activation and inactivation of HGF and generation of antagonistic fragments are summarized in Fig. 1. This work reveals that mast cell chymase hydrolyzes HGF, ablating scatter factor activity and simultaneously generating an antagonistic fragment. The Leu480 hydrolysis site is selective in that related members of the plasminogen subfamily have little homology in this region and resist cleavage. The site of vulnerability is not in a classical kringle domain but in a region connecting K4 to the “activation segment,” which, as shown in Fig. 1, contains the Arg494 site of hydrolytic activation. We propose that Leu480 is part of a 17-residue “inactivation segment” comprised of residues 470–486, which are not connected to other parts of HGF by disulfide bridges. Conservation of Leu480 and surrounding residues in mammalian HGFs hints that changes in this segment are poorly tolerated, possibly because susceptibility to hydrolytic inactivation and release of an antagonistic fragment is important for regulating HGF function. The proposed inactivation segment is one of few regions in which proteolysis will divide HGF into free, inactive fragments. This is because most of HGF, including kringle and peptidase domains, is fortified by overlapping Cys–Cys links. Hydrolysis at most sites will produce nicking without separation of fragments. The peptides between kringles are theoretically vulnerable but appear to be protease-insensitive likely because they are short and inaccessible to bulky peptidases. The observation that elastases cleave human HGF at a site just two residues away from the site cleaved by chymase, along with the finding that cathepsin G cleaves in the same vicinity, invites speculation that these sites lie in an interdomain region in which neutral and hydrophobic residues are exposed. Crystal-derived structures of HGF do not address this point because the inactivation peptide is not included in existing structures. Identification of Leu at the site of hydrolysis itself argues for an unusual degree of exposure, because Leu is not favored at the scissile bond in short peptides cleaved by chymotryptic peptidases generally and chymase particularly. A profiling of the substrate preferences of human chymase with a combinatorial peptide library found the cleavage of substrates with P1 Leu at the site of hydrolysis to be far less likely than when the P1 residue is Phe or Tyr (30Raymond W.W. Waugh Ruggles S. Craik C.S. Caughey G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34517-34524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Profiling with selected 4-nitroanilide and angiotensin-like peptides similarly suggests preferences for P1 aromatic residues (31Powers J.C. Tanaka T. Harper J.W. Minematsu Y. Barker L. Lincoln D.

Notwithstanding target preferences suggested by screening short peptides, at least two other proteins, procollagenase (33Saarinen J. Kalkkinen N. Welgus H.G. Kovanen P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18134-18140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and procollagen 1α (34Kofford M.W. Schwartz L.B. Schechter N.M. Yager D.R. Diegelmann R.F. Graham M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7127-7131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), are cleaved by human chymase at P1 Leu. These proteins and HGF evidently present Leu-containing segments in a more cleaveable conformation than in short peptides with little secondary structure. It bears noting that combinatorial screening suggests that the residues occupying the P4–P2 positions (Ile-Val-Asn) of HGF adjacent to the site hydrolyzed by chymase are favorable when present in short peptides (30Raymond W.W. Waugh Ruggles S. Craik C.S. Caughey G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34517-34524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This suggests that P1 side chain accessibility, combined with P4–P2 side chains interacting favorably with the extended substrate-binding site, contribute to the ability of chymase to hydrolyze at Leu480. The inability of mast cell tryptase to hydrolyze HGF is consistent with the lack of basic residues preferred by tryptic enzymes in the inactivation segment. The present data suggest an explanation for the observation that a product of in vitro differentiated mouse mast cells degrades the HGF α chain (18Fehlner-Gardiner C.C. Cao H. Jackson-Boeters L. Nakamura T. Elliott B.E. Uniyal S. Chan B.M. Differentiation. 1999; 65: 27-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that a particular mouse chymase, MCP4, hydrolyzes HGF in a pattern similar to that generated by the complex mixture of biomolecules released by degranulating mast cells. Thus, MCP4 may be the principal HGF-degrading enzyme of mouse mast cells. In comparison to the large fragment of α chain produced by human chymase, MCP4 also yields one or more smaller bands, which appear to derive from the larger band. This finding suggests hydrolysis by MCP4 at sites less susceptible to human enzyme. Furthermore, MCP4 (but not human chymase) generates angiostatin-like fragments from human plasminogen (not shown). This is not physiologically significant because of the species mismatch and because mouse plasminogen is not cleaved. Although human chymase and mouse MCP4 are similar in physical and enzymatic properties, the present data indicate that they can also differ in hydrolyzing protein targets. Imperfect matching of mouse and human substrate preferences is not surprising given previously established differences, as in hydrolysis of angiotensin (21Caughey G.H. Raymond W.W. Wolters P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1480: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 35Saito K. Muto T. Tomimori Y. Imajo S. Maruoka H. Tanaka T. Yamashiro K. Fukuda Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 773-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). There are no human phylogenetic equivalents to MCP4 and other β-chymases, which may be rodent-specific. The mouse chymase with closest overall structural and phylogenetic similarity to human chymase is MCP5 α-chymase (36Caughey G.H. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 38: 1353-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, an amino acid change in mouse and rat MCP-5 alters the specificity from chymotryptic to elastolytic with little ability to cleave peptide substrates with P1 Phe, Tyr, or Leu (37Kunori Y.

Overall, the present work supports the proposal that MCP4 β-chymase is the closest functional equivalent of human α-chymase (22Tchougounova E. Pejler G. Abrink M. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Other investigations have established that a human mast cell line (HMC-1) and in vitro differentiated mouse mast cells express HGF receptor c-met and respond to HGF (18Fehlner-Gardiner C.C. Cao H. Jackson-Boeters L. Nakamura T. Elliott B.E. Uniyal S. Chan B.M. Differentiation. 1999; 65: 27-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 39Yano K. Nakao K. Sayama K. Hamasaki K. Kato Y. Nakata K. Ishii N. Butterfield J.H. Galli S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 740-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In HMC-1 cells, c-met expression is inducible and exposure to HGF suppresses release of tumor necrosis factor-α (39Yano K. Nakao K. Sayama K. Hamasaki K. Kato Y. Nakata K. Ishii N. Butterfield J.H. Galli S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 740-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In bone marrow-derived mouse mast cells, HGF promotes developmental stage- and integrin-dependant migration (18Fehlner-Gardiner C.C. Cao H. Jackson-Boeters L. Nakamura T. Elliott B.E. Uniyal S. Chan B.M. Differentiation. 1999; 65: 27-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Thus, secreted mast cell chymase and cathepsin G may decrease cytokine release and migration responses to HGF in the vicinity of a degranulating mast cell. Perhaps more significant are the implications of mast cell and neutrophil peptidase-mediated destruction of HGF for the behavior of other cells. Given what is known of the roles of HGF in pathobiology, inactivation by inflammatory peptidases could limit proliferation, migration, or differentiation of c-met-bearing cells in acute response to infection, injury, or allergen exposure. More specifically, selective hydrolysis may oppose HGF effects on epithelial repair in pneumonia, allergic airway inflammation (12Ito W. Kanehiro A. Matsumoto K. Hirano A. Ono K. Maruyama H.

Mast cell secretion of chymase and cathepsin G may modulate the rise of plasma HGF in clot-related disorders such as myocardial infarction. This rise has been linked to clot-stimulated degranulation of mast cells, which release heparin, to which HGF binds, facilitating its role in reparative angiogenesis (8Matsumori A. Cardiovasc. Drugs Ther. 2004; 18: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 19Kinoshita M. Miyamoto T. Ohashi N. Sasayama S. Matsumori A. Circulation. 2002; 106: 3133-3138Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Like HGF, chymase and cathepsin G bind to heparin. Indeed, they associate tightly with heparin in secretory granules and remain bound upon secretion. The mutual attraction of HGF and peptidase to heparin may encourage formation of a ternary complex and selective degradation. The significance of in situ generation of NK4-like protein may lie in coupling of production of an antagonist with destruction of intrinsic activity. This combination may be more powerful than either effect by itself. There may be additional effects specific to the NK4-like fragment, for NK4 antagonizes HGF through competitive inhibition of binding to c-met and also has actions apparently unrelated to c-met, including inhibition of angiogenesis. The large α chain fragment generated by chymase is similar but not identical to NK4 in that NK4 lacks the C-terminal Asn-Leu dipeptide of the chymase-generated fragment. In its capacity to inhibit HGF scatter factor activity, the NK4-like fragment appears to be at least as potent as NK4, in that inhibition is achieved at ratios of antagonist to HGF much lower than reported for NK4 (17Date K. Matsumoto K. Shimura H. Tanaka M. Nakamura T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Cells transcribing the HGF gene sometimes generate splice variants, resulting in truncated proteins containing N-terminal domain plus kringle 1 (NK1) or N-terminal domain plus kringle 1 and 2 (NK2) (40Chan A.M. Rubin J.S. Bottaro D.P. Hirschfield D.W. Chedid M. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1991; 254: 1382-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). These shortened proteins also can act as agonists of HGF. NK1 appears to require heparin to act as an agonist. When used as a drug, NK4 inhibits tumor growth and metastasis (16Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Whether NK4-like protein produced endogenously by inflammatory peptidases has similar activity remains to be determined. These findings suggest potential physiological pathways for generating NK4-like HGF antagonists in allergic and neutrophilic inflammation. The necessary ratios of enzyme to substrate are achievable in the vicinity of migrating neutrophils and degranulating mast cells, where local concentrations of enzyme are transiently high. These ratios also can be reached on a more sustained basis in settings such as purulent bronchitis in cystic fibrosis, where disintegrating neutrophils release active peptidases and overwhelm local antipeptidase defenses. In conclusion, this work reveals that serine peptidases released during allergic and neutrophilic inflammation, acting on HGF, couple inactivation with generation of an HGF antagonist. This is achieved by hydrolyzing an inactivation segment that is conserved in mammals and vulnerable to cleavage by peptidases of varying specificity. Regulation and dysregulation of HGF activity by inflammatory peptidases may be important in diverse types of inflammation.

Precise control of SREBP-targeted genes requires additional interactions with co-regulatory transcription factors. In the case of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), SREBP cooperates with the specificity protein Sp1 to activate the promoter. In this report, we describe a novel pathway in LDLR transcriptional regulation distinct from the SREBP-Sp1 activation complex involving the Sp1-like protein Krueppel-like factor 13 (KLF13). Using a combination of RNA interference, electrophoretic mobility shift, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and reporter assays, deletion, and site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrated that KLF13 mediates repression in a DNA context-selective manner. KLF13 repression of LDLR promoter activity appears to be needed to keep the receptor silent, a state that can be antagonized by Sp1, SREBP, and inhibitors of histone deacetylase activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed that KLF13 binds proximal LDLR DNA sequences in vivo and that exogenous oxysterol up-regulates such binding. Together these studies identify a novel regulatory pathway in which gene repression by KLF13 must be overcome by the Sp1-SREBP complex to activate the LDLR promoter. Therefore, these data should replace a pre-existent and more simple paradigm that takes into consideration only the induction of the activator proteins Sp1-SREBP as necessary for LDLR promoter drive without including default repression, such as that by KLF13, of the LDLR gene.

Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 206Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). An important differentiated property of hepatic smooth muscle endothelial and steroidogenic cells is the expression of the membrane receptor that mediates endocytotic uptake of low density lipoprotein (LDLR) (12Gwynne J.T.

Sp1-like proteins up-regulate both the LDLR and certain steroidogenic genes, such as cytochrome P-450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage (CYP11A), ferredoxin, 17 α-hydroxylase-17,20-lyase (CYP17) and the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (22Chang C.Y.

The clinical importance of Sp1-dependent transcriptional control of the LDLR gene is inferable by marked hyperlipoproteinemia associated with an inactivating mutation of an Sp1 motif in the human LDLR promoter (27Song C.Z. Keller K. Chen Y. Stamatoyannopoulos G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In non-steroidogenic cells, Sp1 and sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) enhance transcriptional activity synergistically (28Yieh L. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6102-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Little is known about such co-activation in steroidogenic cells. In addition, whether other Sp/KLF transregulators modulate LDLR gene expression has not been established. Here, we identity a novel mechanism of LDLR transcriptional regulation that involves the Sp1-like protein, KLF13, BTEB3 (basic transcriptional element-binding protein-3), or fetal KLF. KLF13 acts as a potent transcriptional repressor of the LDLR promoter, wherein transcriptional inhibition is antagonized by Sp1, SREBP, and HDAC inhibitors. Our data support a model in which KLF13 silences the LDLR promoter, unless the SREBP-Sp1 complex antagonizes repression and mediates transcriptional activation. Reagents—Ovine follicle-stimulating hormone (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases oFSH-19; potency 94 × NIH-oFSH-S1) was obtained from the National Hormone and Pituitary Program, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD); porcine insulin and estradiol-17 β were from Sigma; Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM), penicillin/streptomycin, gentamicin, fetal bovine serum, trypsin-EDTA, and Lipofectamine reagent were from Invitrogen; (γ-32P)ATP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; rabbit anti-Sp1 (human 95/105 kDa) was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY); goat antibody to RFLAT-1 (human KLF13 C terminus), HisC (Omini-probe (D-8)), polyclonal rabbit anti-p300 (human C terminus) and anti-Sp3 (human C terminus) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); murine monoclonal anti-SREBP-1 (amino acids 301–407) was from Neomarkers (Freemont, CA); and the Luciferase Reporter Assay System was from Promega (Madison, WI). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by OPERON (Operon Technologies, Inc., Alameda, CA). Granulosa (Ovarian) Cell Culture—Ovaries from pre-pubertal (60–70 kg) swine were collected at an abattoir and transported to the laboratory in iced saline. Granulosa cells were isolated from small- and medium-sized (1–5 mm) antral Graafian follicles by fine needle aspiration under sterile conditions and washed three times by low speed centrifugation (3000 revolutions/min) in MEM. Approximately 5 × 106 viable cells were plated in 12-well culture dishes (Corning, NY) containing bicarbonate-buffered MEM and 3% fetal bovine serum with insulin (1 μg/ml), estradiol(0.5 μg/ml), and follicle-stimulating hormone (5 ng/ml) to permit anchorage and partial luteinization (20LaVoie H.A. Garmey J.C. Day R.N. Veldhuis J.D. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 178-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cells were allowed to attach to culture dishes for 48 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Transient Transfection—In transient transfection analyses, we utilized a 1087-bp 5′ upstream regulatory fragment (–1076 to +11 bp from the transcriptional start site) of the porcine LDLR and 5′-nested deletional constructs driving a cytoplasmically targeted firefly luciferase cDNA (20LaVoie H.A.

After attachment of granulosa cells for 48 h (see above), hormone-free medium was replaced every 24 h twice. Before transfection, monolayers were incubated in serum-free MEM without antibiotics for 20–30 min. Transfection medium (1 ml/well) comprised serum-free MEM without antibiotics containing 1 μg of total plasmid DNA and 6 μl of Lipofectamine. Based on prior time course experiments, 5% serum-containing medium was replaced after 6 h of transfection. After an additional 24 h of recovery to allow vector expression, cells were exposed to serum-free MEM containing antibiotics and the indicated inhibitors or vehicle for 4 or 24 h to monitor basal activity and responses to trichostatin A (TSA) or sodium butyrate, respectively. Where indicated, cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1/HisC epitope-tagged KLF13, pcDNA3.1/SREBP-1a (sterol-responsive element-binding protein), and/or pCMV/hemagglutinin epitope-tagged p300. To quantify reporter expression, cultures were rinsed once at room temperature with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 100 μl of 1× lysis buffer (Luciferase Assay System, Promega, Madison, WI), and stored at –70 °C until later assay. Luciferase activity was measured using 100 μl of firefly substrate (Promega) and 20 μl of cellular lysate in a Turner TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). Data are normalized as relative light units/100 μg of protein and expressed as the mean ± S.E. All experiments were performed at least three times with triplicate incubations. Transfection of mutant LDLR promoter sequences was performed with equimolar concentrations of DNA. A promoterless luciferase construct, p0/luc, exhibiting no significant activity in response to any intervention, was used to adjust total DNA to 1 μg. In co-transfection studies, 0.6 μg of full-length LDLR promoter (pLDLR1076/luc) was added with 0.01–0.3 μg of pcDNA3.1/KLF13 (10Fernandez-Zapico M.E. Mladek A. Ellenrieder V. Folch-Puy E. Miller L. Urrutia R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4748-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), pCMV empty vector and/or pCMV/SREBP-1a (28Yieh L. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Osborne, Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine, CA), or pCMV/Sp1 or Sp3 (from Dr. Robert Tjian, University of California, Berkeley). Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis of pLDLR1076/luc was performed with the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the mutagenic primers (sense) for Sp1-like or SRE cis elements shown. –151/–146 site (wt), 5′-TCCTCC-3′ and (mut), 5′-TCCgaa-3′; –201/–196 site (wt), 5′-TCCTCC-3′ and (mut), 5′-TCCgaa-3′; –216/–208 site (wt), 5′-TCCTCCTCC-3′ and (mut), 5′-TCtTtCTCC-3′; –167/–159 site (wt), 5′-ATCACCCCA-3′ and (mut), 5′-ATCACCgCA-3′. The methylated parental DNA templates were digested with DpnI at 37 °C for 2 h and purified as described previously (29Natesampillai S. Veldhuis J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: E128-E135Google Scholar). Mutations were confirmed by direct dideoxy sequencing. Real-time PCR—Total cellular RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent and reverse transcribed (Reverse Transcriptase, Invitrogen) using 2.5 μm oligo(dT)15, 0.2 μm 18 S reverse template, and 1 μg of RNA. The cDNA was amplified in 25 μl of PCR buffer with IQ SYBR Green Master Mix (Bio-Rad) and specified primers: 18 S (+), 5′-CGATGCTCTTAGCTGAGTGT-3′ and (–), 5′-GGAACTACGGTATCTGA-3′; LDLR (+), 5′-GACGAGGAGAACTGCGATGT-3′ and (–), 5′-GGCACTCATAGCCGATCTTG; KLF13 (+), 5′-TTACGGGAAATCTTCGCACCT-3′ and (–), 5′-AACTTCTTCTCGCCCGTGTG-3′; KLF9 (+), 5′-CGAGCGGCTGCGACTACCTG-3′ and (–), 5′-GGGCTGTGGGAAGGACTCGAC-3′; KLF4 (+), 5′-CAGCTCCCCAGCAGGACTACC-3′ and (–) 5′-CATCTGAGCGGGCGAATTC-3′. Thermocycling conditions were optimized as the initial denaturation (95 °C for 3 min); 40 cycles of amplification (95 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 20 s, 72 °C for 30 s); and melting curve analysis (95 °C for 3 min) followed by 60–95 °C, increasing 0.5 °C every 10 s). Standard curves were run as 10× serial dilutions from the amplified target cDNA (quantified using PicoGreen double-stranded DNA (Molecular Probes)) over the inclusive range 1 × 107 to 10 copies. Estimates were computed from the CT (cycle threshold) and normalized to 18 S rRNA in the same sample. The quality of the real-time-PCR product was monitored by agarose gel electrophoresis and the specificity by the melting temperature. PCR efficiency exceeded 85% as calculated from the slope of the standard curves (r > 0.95). The median precision estimated from the absolute copy number was 8.9% (intra-assay) and 12.5% (inter-assay). Nuclear Protein Isolation and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The general procedure outlined by Dignam et al. (50Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) was followed with some modifications, as follows. Granulosa-luteal cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and detached from culture dishes by scraping, recovered by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, resuspended in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and pelleted at 12,000 × g for 20 s. The cells were lysed in ice-cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and freshly added 10 μl of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) and mixed by pipetting. After incubation on ice for 10 min, Nonidet P-40 was added to a final detergent concentration of 0.05% and the solution mixed by pipetting before centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 s. The nuclear pellet was suspended in 100 μl of ice-cold buffer B (containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25% glycerol, and 5 μl of protease inhibitor mixture). The suspension was placed on ice for 30 min with an occasional gentle shaking and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to obtain the nuclear extract (supernatant). The latter was stored at –70 °C. Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). EMSA reactions were performed in 20 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe (50,000 counts/min), and 10 μg of nuclear protein for 30 min at 23 °C. Antibodies or cold oligonucleotides were pre-incubated with nuclear proteins at 4 °C for 1 h or for 30 min, respectively. Protein-DNA complexes were separated from free probe by 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at 200 V for 2.5 h. The gels were subjected to autoradiography overnight at –80 °C. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assay evaluates whether a given transcription factor is bound to a distinct proximal promoter DNA sequence in living cells. Specificity of transcription factor binding is achieved by immunoprecipitation of formaldehyde-cross-linked protein-DNA (chromatin) complexes. The gene sequence is verified by primer-specific PCR of DNA purified from chromatin precipitates. For ChIP assay, granulosa-luteal cells were transfected with epitope-tagged KLF13 or p300 and then consecutively cross-linked by the addition of formaldehyde at a 1% final volume for 10 min at 37 °C, quenched by adding glycine, and harvested by scraping in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline with fresh complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The cells were then pelleted and resuspended in SDS lysis buffer containing inhibitors and then sonicated on ice to release 200–800-bp DNA fragments, microcentrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C, and resuspended in dilution buffer. The cells were pre-cleared with DNA- and albumin-blocked protein A-agarose for 30 min at 4 °C, aliquoted to retain a 5% sample for later PCR of DNA input, and incubated overnight with affinity-purified Ab to KLF13 or cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein versus no Ab versus mouse gamma globulin (negative controls) with rotation at 4 °C and then precipitated with salmon sperm DNA protein A-agarose for 1 h at 4°C. The cells were washed successively in low and high salt, LiCl and Tris-EDTA buffers (Cell Signaling Technologies catalog number 17-295, Lake Placid, NY). Cross-linked DNA complexes were dissociated for real-time-PCR (see below) or boiled for 10 min in Laemmli buffer for Western blot. To reverse cross-links, chromatin complexes (including input samples) were incubated in 5 m NaCl at 65 °C for 4 h, resuspended in Tris-EDTA-proteinase K buffer for 1 h at 45°C, extracted in triple alcohol, and reprecipitated with 20 μg of yeast tRNA and 2 volumes of ethanol overnight at 4 °C. The complexes were then washed with 70% ethanol and air dried. Purified DNA was resuspended in 25 μl of H2O for PCR using the LDLR promoter-specific primers (+), 5′-GAGTCAGGGCTTCACGGGTTA-3′ and (–), 5′-CTGTTCACTGTGTGCGCTCTTG-3′. Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Pull-down Assays—GST alone or a fused GST-KLF13 cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells (Amersham Biosciences). HepG2 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-HisC (Invitrogen) containing the cDNA encoding mature human SREBP-1a protein. To monitor the physical association between KLF13 and SREBP-1a, the GST-KLF13 fusion peptide or GST was incubated with [35S]methionine-labeled SREBP-1a (amino acids 1–490) or SREBP-1a-del (amino acids 91–490) using TnT quick-coupled transcription/translation systems (Promega, Madison, WI) and SREBP-1- or SREBP-2-transfected HepG2 cell lysate (100 μg of protein) in GST binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 1 mm ETDA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% IGEPAL CA-360, and protein inhibitors). The peptide complex was recovered by the addition of 50 μl of 50% glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) followed by incubation with gentle rocking for 2 h at 4°C. Centrifuged beads were washed five times with GST binding buffer, boiled in Laemmli buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with HisC mouse monoclonal antibody (Omniprobe, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For [35S]methionine GST pull-down, dried gels were exposed using a phosphorimaging device. Western Blot—Western blots were performed by boiling nuclear protein extracts in Laemmli buffer, separation on 10% denaturing SDS-PAGE, transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunochemiluminescent detection as described previously (29Natesampillai S. Veldhuis J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: E128-E135Google Scholar). Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—KLF13 RNA interference was achieved using a pool of four siRNA duplexes obtained from Dharmacon Research (SMARTpool, human KLF13, MN_015995, Lafayette, CO). Non-targeting siRNA served as a control DNA sequence with no matches upon BLAST search. Transfection of granulosa-luteal cells with siRNA was performed using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) to achieve a final concentration of siRNA of 20 nm (optimized from 10, 20, 40, and 100 nm). Transfection also included empty vector, full-length pLDLR1076/luc, and/or human KLF13 followed by recovery for 48 h before assay of luciferase activity. Analogous transfection of HepG2 cells was used to extract protein for Western blotting to confirm inhibition of KLF13 expression. Statistical Methods—Observations are based on three or more independent experiments conducted using separate batches of 150–200 ovaries. Data pooled among experiments were subjected to one- or two-way analysis of variance in a repeated measures design (30Kuehl R.O. Statistical Principles of Research Design and Analysis. Duxbury Press, Belmont, CA1994Google Scholar). Ratio values (observed to control) were log-transformed to limit the dispersion of residual variance. Means were contrasted by the post hoc Tukey multiple comparison test at p < 0.05. The LDLR gene promoter used in this study exhibits three Sp1-like TC-rich (5′-TCCTCC-3′) sequences flanking a canonical sterol response element (SRE) within a delimited –255/–139-bp region 5′ upstream of the transcriptional start site (21Natesampillai S. Veldhuis J.D. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2921-2928Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Each TC-predominant sequence binds immunoreactive Sp1, Sp3, and an unidentified mithramycin-displaceable nuclear protein (29Natesampillai S. Veldhuis J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: E128-E135Google Scholar, 31Chatterjee S. Zaman K. Ryu H. Conforto A. Ratan R.R. Ann. Neurol. 2001; 49: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In the current study, initial experiments aimed at characterizing the importance of these sites in the transcriptional control of LDLR promoter revealed sensitivity to HDAC inhibitors, suggesting a role for histone modification. As shown in Fig. 1A, porcine granulosa-luteal cells, used here as a model for cells that both contain the LDLR and display an intense cholesterol metabolism involved in hormone synthesis, were exposed to the HDAC inhibitors TSA (10 ng/ml) or sodium butyrate (0.5 mm) (32Van Lint C. Emiliani S. Verdin E. Gene Expr. 1996; 5: 245-253PubMed Google Scholar) for 24 h after transfection with pLDLR1076/luc or selected proximal deletional constructs. TSA and sodium butyrate increased reporter activity of full-length and truncated pLDLR455/luc and pLDLR255/luc by >2-fold. Quantifiable real-time-PCR revealed that TSA also increased LDLR transcript abundance by 2.2-fold (not shown). Deletion to pLDLR139/luc abrogated TSA and sodium butyrate-induced up-regulation, pointing to an acetylation-sensitive inhibitory region located –255/–139 bp 5′ upstream of the transcriptional start site. This segment in the pig LDLR gene contains three putative Sp1 elements surrounding a canonical SRE (Fig. 1B). The Sp1-like motif is 5′-TCCTCC-3′, which is analogous to DNA sequences by which Sp1-KLF proteins activate or repress other genes (3Kaczynski J. Cook T. Urrutia R. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 206Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar, 33Philipsen S. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2991-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). In earlier gel mobility shift assay analyses, each of the immunoreactive Sp1 and Sp3 and an unknown protein extracted from the nuclei of granulosa-luteal cells bound all three Sp1-like sequences in the porcine LDLR promoter (29Natesampillai S. Veldhuis J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: E128-E135Google Scholar). Therefore, these results lead us to hypothesize that the unidentified nuclear protein that binds the TC-rich DNA sequences in the proximal LDLR promoter may be a member of the Sp/KLF family of proteins, because they share similar binding sequences. To test this hypothesis, we first assessed Sp/KLF gene expression in ovarian cells by real-time-PCR using low stringency primers to conserved zinc finger domains of the KLF superfamily. The motivation was recent microarray data showing transcripts for KLF2, KLF4, and KLF9 in the ovary and testis, although of unknown function (34Jo M. Gieske M.C. Payne C.E. Wheeler-Price S.E.

Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 3050-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Quantifiable PCR and sequencing revealed transcripts for KLF9 (GenBank™ AY850383), KLF4 (GenBank™ DQ000310), and KLF13 (GenBank™ AY850382) with relative abundancies of 1.0, 48, and 25, respectively (n = 10 experiments) (not shown). The swine KLF9 and KLF4 coding sequences comprised 735 and 1533 nucleotides and had 96.7 and 89.2% sequence identity with cognate human genes, respectively. The KLF13 cDNA contained 879 nucleotides and had 83% identity with the human sequence. Predicted KLF9 (244 amino acids), KLF4 (512 amino acids), and KLF13 (292 amino acids) peptides were 99.2, 92.4, and 92.8% identical with the human counterparts, respectively (evaluated by EMBOSS-Align www.ebi.uk). These data indicate that these KLF proteins are good candidates to regulate the LDLR promoter in these cells. Earlier EMSA analyses performed with nuclear extracts of granulosaluteal cells identified competitive binding by immunoreactive Sp1 and Sp3 to each of three contextually distinct LDLR promoter TC-rich oligodeoxynucleotide sequences in the LDLR promoter (29Natesampillai S. Veldhuis J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: E128-E135Google Scholar). Our early study confirmed that granulosa-luteal cell nuclear protein binds to all three TC-rich motifs with Sp1/Sp3 immunospecificity. There was an unknown, rapidly migrating complex, which was postulated to reflect"
https://openalex.org/W2075793653,"An amyloid-associated serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin), α1-antichymotrypsin (ACT), is encoded by a gene located within the distal serpin subcluster on human chromosome 14q32.1. The expression of these distal serpin genes is determined by tissue-specific chromatin structures that allow their ubiquitous expression in hepatocytes; however, their expression is limited to a single ACT gene in astrocytes. In astrocytes and glioma cells, six specific DNase I-hypersensitive sites (DHSs) were found located exclusively in the 5′-flanking region of the ACT gene. We identified two enhancers that mapped to the two DHSs at –13 kb and –11.5 kb which contain activator protein-1 (AP-1) binding sites, both of which are critical for basal astrocyte-specific expression of ACT reporters. In vivo, these elements are occupied by c-jun homodimers in unstimulated cells and c-jun/c-fos heterodimers in interleukin-1-treated cells. Moreover, functional c-jun is required for the expression of ACT in glioma cells because both transient and stable inducible overexpression of dominant-negative c-jun(TAM67) specifically abrogates basal and reduces cytokine-induced expression of ACT. Expression-associated methylation of lysine 4 of histone H3 was also lost in these cells, but the DHS distribution pattern and global histone acetylation were not changed upstream of the ACT locus. Interestingly, functional AP-1 is also indispensable for the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which is an astrocyte-specific marker. We propose that AP-1 is a key transcription factor that, in part, controls astrocyte-specific expression of genes including the ACT and GFAP genes.

We propose that AP-1 is a key transcription factor that, in part, controls astrocyte-specific expression of genes including the ACT and GFAP genes. The 11 genes encoding the serine proteinase inhibitors (serpins) 2The abbreviations used are: serpins, serine proteinase inhibitors; ACT, α1-antichymotrypsin; AP-1, activator protein-1; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; C/EBP, CAAT enhancer-binding protein; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; DHS, DNase I-hypersensitive sites; EMSA, electron mobility shift assay; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; HNF, hepatocyte nuclear factor; IL, interleukin; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; OSM, oncostatin M; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; tk, thymidine kinase. are clustered on human chromosome 14q32.1 and occupy the ∼370 kb region (1Rollini P. Fournier R.E. Genomics. 1997; 46: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 2Namciu S.J. Friedman R.D. Marsden M.D. Sarausad L.M. Jasoni C.L. Fournier R.E.K. Mamm. Genome. 2004; 15: 162-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This serpin cluster can be divided into three subclusters that contain 4, 3, and 4 genes, respectively. The distal subcluster consists of the genes encoding the α1-antichymotrypsin (ACT), kallistatin, protein C inhibitor, and the recently identified kallistatin-like protein (2Namciu S.J. Friedman R.D. Marsden M.D. Sarausad L.M. Jasoni C.L. Fournier R.E.K. Mamm. Genome. 2004; 15: 162-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All of these genes are highly transcribed in hepatocytes and hepatoma cells, and their promoters are accessible to DNase I digestion (3Gopalan S. Kasza A. Xu W. Kiss D.L. Wilczynska K.M. Rydel R.E. Kordula T. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 763-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In contrast, only the ACT gene is expressed in brain astrocytes and glioma cells (3Gopalan S. Kasza A. Xu W. Kiss D.L. Wilczynska K.M. Rydel R.E. Kordula T. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 763-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Selective expression of ACT in these cells correlates with DNase I accessibility at the 5′-flanking region of the gene, whereas non-expressed protein C inhibitor and kallistatin genes are localized in DNase I-inaccessible chromatin (3Gopalan S. Kasza A. Xu W. Kiss D.L. Wilczynska K.M. Rydel R.E. Kordula T. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 763-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In the liver, hepatocyte-specific gene expression is determined by transcription factors belonging to the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) and CAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) families, with HNF-1 and HNF-4 being critical, but not sufficient, for the expression of the genes from the proximal serpin subcluster (4Rollini P. Fournier R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10308-10313Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The presence of binding sites for these transcription factors near the promoters of the distal serpin genes suggests that they play a critical role in their expression in hepatic cells. However, HNF1, HNF3, HNF4, and C/EBP-α, the predominant member of the C/EBP family found in nonstimulated hepatocytes, are not expressed in brain astrocytes. Therefore, yet to be identified, astrocyte-specific factors likely determine the astrocyte-specific chromatin structure of the distal serpin subcluster and the astrocyte-specific expression of the ACT gene in both astrocytes and glioma cells. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an intermediate filament protein, is expressed exclusively in astrocytes, and the 2.2-kb long 5′-flanking region of the GFAP gene is widely used specifically to express transgenes in astrocytes (5Brenner M. Kisseberth W.C. Su Y. Besnard F. Messing A. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1030-1037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, several other genes including the gene encoding glioma-specific cytokine S100β and a glioma-selective promoter of the human polyomavirus JC are expressed in both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (6Vives V. Alonso G. Solal A.C. Joubert D. Legraverend C. J. Comp. Neurol. 2003; 457: 404-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 7Wroblewska Z. Kennedy P.G. Wellish M.C. Lisak R.P. Gilden D.H. J. Neurol. Sci. 1982; 54: 189-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanisms that allow the tissue-specific expression of these genes are not understood. Increased expression of the ACT gene is found in the brains of patients suffering from Alzheimer disease (8Abraham C.R. Selkoe D.J. Potter H. Cell. 1988; 52: 487-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 9Pasternack J.M. Abraham C.R. Van Dyke B.J. Potter H. Younkin S.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1989; 135: 827-834PubMed Google Scholar). This serpin, produced primarily by astrocytes, colocalizes with the β-amyloid peptide found in plaques in the brains of Alzheimer disease patients. In astrocytes the expression of ACT is regulated by proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1, OSM, and complexes of IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptors (10Kordula T. Rydel R.E. Brigham E.F. Horn F.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7510-7516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously identified the IL-1-responsive enhancer (at –13 kb) and the IL-6/OSM-responsive proximal elements both located upstream of the coding region of the ACT gene which mediate the responsiveness to cytokines (10Kordula T.

Travis J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7510-7516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism that allows astrocyte-specific basal expression of ACT is not known. We have reported previously the presence of six DNase I-hypersensitive sites (DHSs) in the 5′-flanking region of the ACT gene in astrocytes and glioma cells (3Gopalan S. Kasza A. Xu W. Kiss D.L. Wilczynska K.M. Rydel R.E. Kordula T. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 763-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We initiated this study with the aim of identifying key trans-acting factors that bind to regulatory elements within these DHSs and to determine their effect(s) on astrocyte-specific ACT expression. Here we identify two AP-1-binding elements that are indispensable for the basal expression of the ACT gene in astrocytes. Our data demonstrate that AP-1 is a critical factor required for the constitutive expression of the ACT gene in astrocytes. In addition, we show that AP-1 is also indispensable for the expression of GFAP, which is an astrocyte-specific marker. Cell Culture—Human hepatoma HepG2, glioma U373-MG and A172, and cervical carcinoma HeLa cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). These cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, antibiotics, sodium pyruvate, and nonessential amino acids. U373 stable clones expressing c-jun(TAM67) were cultured in the presence of 10 μg/ml blasticidin, 100 μg/ml zeocin, and 2 μg/ml tetracycline (all from Invitrogen) as needed. Cytokines and Cell Stimulation—Cells were stimulated with 25 ng/ml OSM and 5 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor α (both from R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis) or 10 ng/ml IL-1 (a gift from Immunex Corp., Seattle). One μm dexamethasone (Sigma) was also added to enhance cytokine action. RNA Preparation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was prepared by phenol extraction exactly as described previously (3Gopalan S. Kasza A. Xu W. Kiss D.L. Wilczynska K.M. Rydel R.E. Kordula T. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 763-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The filters were prehybridized at 65 °C for 3 h in 0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 7% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA, and hybridized in the same solution with cDNA fragments of ACT, GFAP, and GAPDH labeled by random priming (12Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar). After the hybridization, nonspecifically bound radioactivity was removed by four washes in 40 mm phosphate buffer, 1% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA at 65 °C for 20 min each. Synthetic Oligonucleotides—The following oligonucleotides were synthesized and subsequently used to generate PCR products containing the six DHSs. These PCR products were generated using Taq DNA polymerase, purified from gels using the gel purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and subsequently used in gel retardation assays: DHS1, 5′-CTGGGAGGCTTCCTGCTA-3′ and 5′-GACAAAACTGTGTGAGTCAGC-3′; DHS2, 5′-GATTGTATTATGAGATTTACTGG-3′ and 5′-CAGGAACTCCGTGAGATAATC-3′; DHS3, 5′-AGCAGGATATTTCTGTCTC-3′ and 5′-ATTTCAGAACTGCTGCACGC-3′; DHS4, 5′-CAGCACGAACCCAGCCAG-3′ and 5′-GATCCAGAGAACCCTGAGAA-3′; DHS5, 5′-GAGACAGAGTCTCTCTGTG-3′ and 5′-GCATCATGGCGCATGCCT-3′; DHS6, 5′-CAAGCCCGTATTACCAGAAAT-3′ and 5′-GATTCCAAAGCCGTCTGTC-3′. The following oligonucleotides were synthesized containing BamHI sites to obtain PCR products that were used to construct reporter plasmids: DHS1, 5′-GGAGGATCCCTGGGAGGCTTCCTGCTA-3′ and 5′-CAACGGATCCGACAAAACTGTGTGAGTCAGC-3′; DHS2, 5′-TGTGGATCCGATTGTATTATGAGATTTACTGG-3′ and 5′-CCTGGATCCCAGGAACTCCGTGAGATAATC-3′; DHS3, 5′-CGAGGATCCGAGCAGGATATTTCTGTCTC-3′ and 5′-CTGGGATCCATTTCAGAACTGCTGCACGC-3′; DHS4, 5′-CAAAGGATCCCAGCACGAACCCAGCCAG-3′ and 5′-ACACGGATCCGATCCAGAGAACCCTGAGAA-3′; DHS5, 5′-GAGGGATCCTCTCTCTGTGTTGCCCAGGCT-3′ and 5′-ACTGGATCCGCATGGCGCATGCCT-3′; DHS6, 5′-TAGGGATCCCAAGCCCGTATTACCAGAAAT-3′ and 5′-TAGGGATCCGATTCCAAAGC CGTCTGTC-3′; ST1, 5-TTGAGGATCCCTGTGAGTAGCCCAC-3′; ST2, 5′-CCCAGGATCCCTGAGAGTCAAGAGG-3′; ST4, 5′-CAAGGGATCCTTCTGGGATTGCCCTG-3′; ST5, 5′-TCAGGGATCCAGGATTGCTGTTG-3′; posAP1, 5′-CTCTGGATCCGTAGATGACTAACACATTC-3′. The point mutations in the AP-1 and NF-κB sites were generated using the following primers: 5′-GTAGAAGCTTAACACATTCCACAGC-3′, 5′-TGTTAAGCTTCTACTGCTGCAGAG-3′, and 5′-CAAGGATCCTTCTCGAGTTGCCCTGGCCAACAGC-3′. Plasmid Construction—Plasmids ptkCATΔEH, p′a′StCAT, pSSCAT, pΔACTCAT, and pStACTCAT have been described previously (11Kordula T. Bugno M. Rydel R.E. Travis J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7510-7516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids pDHS1-tk-CAT, pDHS2-tk-CAT, pDHS3-tk-CAT, pDHS4-tk-CAT, pDHS5-tk-CAT, and pDHS6-tk-CAT were generated by insertion of the corresponding BamHI-digested PCR products into the BamHI site of the plasmid ptkCATΔEH. Plasmid pmutAP-1(DHS2)-tk-CAT with the mutated AP-1 site in the DHS2 region was constructed using the QuikChange XL Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Strategene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid pS(E-S)ACT was generated by deletion of the EcoRV-BamHI fragment from plasmid pSSCAT. Subsequently, plasmids pD(A-S)ACT and pΔAatIIACT were generated by deletion of the AflII-SpeI or AflII-AflII fragments, respectively, from plasmid pS(E-S)ACT, whereas plasmid pS(E-S)ACT was by cloning of the 1.2-kb SphI-EcoRV fragment from pSSCAT into the SphI-BamHI(blunt)-digested pStACTCAT. Plasmids pST4ST2, pST1ST5, pposAP-1, pmutNF, and ppmutAP were generated by insertion of the BamHI-digested PCR products into the BamHI/BglII sites of pStACTCAT. A plasmid encoding dominant-negative c-jun, pCMVc-jun(TAM67) (13Brown P.H. Alani R. Preis L.H. Szabo E. Birrer M.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 877-886PubMed Google Scholar), was obtained from Dr. Zendra Zehner, VCU, Richmond, VA. The expression vector was constructed using the T-REx™ system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The plasmid pCMVc-jun(TAM67) was digested with BamHI, and the 931-bp product containing c-jun(TAM67) was cloned into the BamHI site of pcDNA4T/O. Transient Transfections—Cells were transfected using GeneJuice transfection reagent (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany), according to the supplier's instructions. Plasmid DNA (350 ng of the CAT reporter plasmid and 50 ng of the β-galactosidase expression plasmid) and 5 μl of GeneJuice diluted in 50 μl of serum-free medium were used to transfect cells growing in 1 ml of culture medium. One day after transfection, cells were stimulated, cultured another 24 h, and harvested. Protein extracts were prepared by freeze thawing (14Gorman C. Glover D. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1985: 143-190Google Scholar), and protein concentration was determined by the BCA method (Sigma). Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described (15Delegeane A.M. Ferland L.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3994-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). CAT activities are normalized to the internal control β-galactosidase activity. Experiments were repeated three to five times yielding similar results, and a representative example of each experiment is shown. Nucleofection—U373 cells (1 × 106/6-cm dish) were trypsinized, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in 600 μl of T Nucleofactor solution™ (Amaxa, Koln, Germany). Two μg of the respective plasmids (c-jun(TAM67) or pUC19) were added to the solution, and transfection was performed using the Nucleofector device (Amaxa) with the electrical setting of T-20. One ml of warm Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was added, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and transferred to 6-cm dishes containing 5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Typical nucleofection efficiency was greater than 70% with cell viability close to 100%. One day after nucleofection, cells were stimulated with the respective cytokines for 18 h and processed as described earlier. Stable Transfections—U373 cells expressing c-jun(TAM67) were generated using the T-REx™ system. U373 cells were transfected in 10-cm dishes with pcDNA6/TR using GeneJuice transfection reagent, according to the supplier's instructions. Four μg of pcDNA6/TR and 20 μl of GeneJuice were diluted in 650 μl of serum-free medium/dish. Two days after transfections, transformants were selected in the presence of 10 μg/ml blasticidin. Stable clones were isolated after 3 weeks by glass cylinder cloning. Subsequently these stable cells were transfected with pcDNA4/TOc-jun(TAM67) in 10-cm dishes as described above and selected in the presence of 2 μg/ml zeocin. Positive clones were isolated and maintained in the presence of both blasticidin and zeocin. Nuclear Extract Preparation and Electron Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (16Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar). Double-stranded fragments were labeled by filling the 5′-protruding ends with Klenow enzyme using 3,000 Ci/mmol [α-32P]dCTP (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Alternatively, they were labeled by PCR in the presence of 3,000 Ci/mmol [α-32P]dCTP using Taq DNA polymerase. Gel retardation assays were performed according to published procedures using 5 μg of nuclear extracts (18Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar, 19Sawadogo M. Van Dyke M.W. Gregor P.D. Roeder R.G. J. Biol.

Polyclonal anti-c-jun (sc-45), anti-junB (sc-8051), anti-junD (sc-74), anti-c-fos (sc-52), anti-fra1 (sc-605), anti-fra2 (sc-171), and anti-fosB (sc-7203) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) and used for supershift studies. Western Blotting—U373 cells growing in 6-well plates were lysed in 200 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). These 20-μl samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). GFAP and c-jun were detected using polyclonal sc-9065 and sc-45 antibodies, respectively. Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Isolation of Nuclei and DHS Mapping—Clones were cultured in the presence of 2 μg/ml tetracycline for 5 days. Nuclei were isolated and treated with increasing concentrations of DNase I exactly as described previously (3Gopalan S. Kasza A. Xu W. Kiss D.L. Wilczynska K.M. Rydel R.E. Kordula T. J.

Purified genomic DNA (10 μg/gel lane) was digested with the appropriate restriction enzyme, separated in 0.8% agarose gel, and transferred to Hybond-XL membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were hybridized to random primer-labeled SG5 and PRA7 probes (3Gopalan S. Kasza A. Xu W. Kiss D.L. Wilczynska K.M. Rydel R.E. Kordula T. J.

After the hybridization nonspecifically bound radioactivity was removed by three washes in 40 mm phosphate buffer, 1% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA at 65 °C for 20 min. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—Stable clones were cultured in the presence of 2 μg/ml tetracycline for 5 days, and chromatin was cross-linked by the addition of formaldehyde to 1% followed by a 10-min incubation at 37 °C. Subsequently, the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 125 mm glycine and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Chromatin was sonicated and immunoprecipitated using specific antibodies exactly as described in the ChIP protocol from Upstate Inc. (Charlottesville, VA). The following antibodies were used: anti-acetyl histone H3 (ab2381), anti-acetylhistone H4 (ab1758) (Abcam, Inc., Cambridge, MA), anti-dimethylhistone H3 (lysine 4) (07–030) (Charlottesville, VA), anti-c-jun (sc-45), and anti-c-fos (sc-52) both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Activator Protein-1 (AP-1) Binds to DNase I-hypersensitive Sites DHS1 and DHS2—We have shown previously that the astrocyte-specific expression of the ACT gene is associated with the tissue-specific chromatin structures at the distal serpin subcluster (3Gopalan S. Kasza A. Xu W. Kiss D.L. Wilczynska K.M. Rydel R.E. Kordula T. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 763-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This subcluster is easily accessible in HepG2 cells where all three genes encoding kallistatin, protein C inhibitor, and ACT are expressed. In contrast, it is accessible only near the IL-1-responsive enhancer and the ACT gene promoter in primary human astrocytes and glioma cells. We have identified six DHSs located nearby the IL-1 enhancer and the ACT promoter in astrocytes and U373 cells (3Gopalan S. Kasza A. Xu W. Kiss D.L. Wilczynska K.M. Rydel R.E. Kordula T. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 763-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To identify the astrocyte-specific factors required for the ACT expression, we analyzed the binding of proteins to the DNA fragments covering these six DHSs by EMSA. Each of these fragments was assayed for binding in vitro using nuclear extracts from ACT-expressing glioma cells (U373 and A172), hepatoma cells (HepG2), and nonexpressing carcinoma (HeLa) cells. We have obtained multiple bands and hence performed competition experiments to confirm their specificity (Fig. 1). Simultaneously, we analyzed the fragments using the Mat Inspector program (www.genomatix.de) to identify transcription factor binding sites. A number of binding sites were identified including two AP-1 elements within the DHS1 and DHS2 fragments. These elements were analyzed further for the binding of AP-1 because this factor is very abundant in astrocytes (compared with hepatoma cells (20Kiss D.L. Xu W. Gopalan S. Buzanowska K. Wilczynska K.M. Rydel R.E. Kordula T. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 730-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar)), and it has also been suggested to regulate the expression of the GFAP gene, which is an astrocyte-specific marker. We confirmed the binding of AP-1 to both fragments (DHS1 and DHS2) by competition with the AP-1 oligonucleotide in both glioma cell lines, as well as in HeLa cells, which contain abundant amounts of endogenous AP-1 (Fig. 1, A and B). However, AP-1 did not bind to DHS1 and DHS2 in hepatoma HepG2 cells. The same expression pattern of ACT in both A172 and U373 glioma cells suggests that a common factor should bind to the DHSs in both cell lines. The binding pattern observed with probes DHS3 and DHS4 was different among these cells (Fig. 1, C and D). Therefore, we concluded that factors binding to DHS3 and DHS4 are likely not relevant for glioma-specific expression. The DHS5 probe did not bind any protein specifically, whereas DHS6, which corresponds to the ACT core promoter, likely binds factors from the basal transcriptional machinery (Fig. 1, E and F). To identify the components of the AP-1 complex that bind to DHS1 and DHS2, we performed supershift analysis using extracts from glioma and hepatoma cells. The supershifts (Fig. 2) indicate that c-jun is the major component of the AP-1 complex and binds to both DHS1 and DHS2 in U373 cells, whereas amounts of c-fos were much lower. Neither c-jun nor c-fos binding was detected in HepG2 cells because none of the DNA-protein complexes was supershifted. We conclude that AP-1 specifically binds to DHS1 and DHS2 in glioma cells; however, some other factor(s) bind(s) to these elements in hepatoma cells. DHS1 and DHS2 Can Function as Enhancers in U373 Cells—To analyze whether these six DHSs have a regulatory role, we linked each of the six DHSs to the thymidine kinase (tk)-promoter driving the transcription of the CAT reporter gene and analyzed these reporter constructs in transient transfections of U373 cells. The fragments containing both DHS1 and DHS2 increased the basal activity of the reporter constructs by 4–5-fold, whereas the other DHSs had no effect (Fig. 3A). To determine whether DHS1 and DHS2 fragments can also act as IL-1-responsive elements, we stimulated U373 cells (transiently transfected as before) with IL-1. The fragments containing DHS1 and DHS2 conferred IL-1 responsiveness (1.5–2-fold) onto the tk promoter, whereas the other fragments were ineffective (Fig. 3B). A previously identified 413-bp IL-1-responsive enhancer located 13 kb upstream from the transcription start site of the ACT gene contains two NF-κB and one AP-1 binding site (11Kordula T. Bugno M. Rydel R.E. Travis J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7510-7516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 160-bp DHS1 fragment partially overlaps this IL-1-responsive enhancer including its AP-1 binding sites. It has already been shown that mutation of this AP-1 site (at –13 kb) leads to a 50% decrease in the IL-1 responsiveness. To determine whether the other AP-1 site located within the DHS2 fragment (at –11.5 kb) is also required for full transcriptional activity of this new enhancer, we mutated this site in the corresponding reporter plasmid. This mutation resulted in a dramatic loss of basal activity of the reporter plasmid when transfected into U373 cells (Fig. 3C). We have antecedently reported that the reporter containing the 413-bp IL-1-responsive enhancer (located at –13 kb) is less responsive to IL-1 than the reporter containing 8-kb fragment, which suggested the presence of an additional regulatory element (11Kordula T. Bugno M. Rydel R.E. Travis J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7510-7516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we generated a series of deletion reporters and tested them in transfection experiments (Fig. 4). This analysis resulted in the identification of an additional IL-1-responsive fragment that contained putative NF-κB and AP-1 binding sites. Interestingly, this fragment partially overlaps with the DHS2 fragment, and the AP-1 site we identified by this deletion analysis is identical to the site we identified by EMSA. Mutation of the AP-1 element within this reporter also abolished the responsiveness to IL-1, whereas mutation of the NF-κB element had no effect. From these results we conclude that both DHS1 and DHS2 fragments containing two AP-1-binding elements are critical for the full basal transcriptional activity. c-jun, c-fos, fosB, and fra1 Are Major Components of the AP-1 Complex Binding to the ACT Enhancer Elements in Glioma Cells—The AP-1 family of transcription factors includes the Jun and Fos family members. c-jun can form stable homo- and heterodimers with other members of the AP-1 family, whereas members of the Fos family do not homodimerize, but form stable heterodimers with Jun proteins (21Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E131-E136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2251) Google Scholar). We analyzed the composition of AP-1 complexes that bind to the newly identified AP-1 binding site at –11.5 kb (DHS2) in untreated U373 cells and cells treated with IL-1, OSM, and tumor necrosis factor. The binding of AP-1 to this oligonucleotide was competed off by cold AP-1 probes (both –13 kb and –11.5 kb AP-1 elements), but not by cold oligonucleotides containing binding sites for NF-κB, STAT, or C/EBP (Fig. 5A). The AP-1 complexes in untreated U373 cells contained c-jun and a limited amount of fra1, whereas IL-1 stimulation resulted in induction of some c-fos and fosB (Fig. 5, B and C). Hence, we conclude that c-jun homodimers are likely bound to the –11.5 kb AP-1 element in untreated cells, whereas IL-1 stimulation results in the heterodimerization of c-jun with c-fos, fosB, or fra1. The Elements at –11.5 kb and –13 kb Are Bound by AP-1 Complexes in Vivo—Next, we analyzed the binding of AP-1 to the elements located at –13 kb (DHS1) and –11.5 kb (DHS2) in vivo using ChIP analysis in different cell lines (Fig. 6). c-jun binding was detected in both elements in untreated U373 cells, whereas the binding of c-fos was marginal. IL-1 treatment resulted in a decrease of c-jun and an increase in c-fos binding, mostly at the –11.5 kb element, indicating replacement of c-jun homodimers with c-jun/c-fos heterodimers. In contrast to glioma cells, no binding of c-jun or c-fos was detected in vivo in HeLa cells, even though they express abundant amounts of endogenous AP-1. This discrepancy can be explained because both of these enhancers (–11.5 and –13 kb elements) are localized in the inac"

Here we demonstrated that TTV/DEXT1 and SOTV/DEXT2 had GlcNAcT-II and GlcAT-II activities required for the biosynthesis of repeating disaccharide units of the HS backbone, and the coexpression of TTV with SOTV markedly augmented both glycosyltransferase activities when compared with the expression of TTV or SOTV alone.

Most interestingly, it has been revealed that EXTL3 possesses both GlcNAcT-I and Glc-NAcT-II activities, which are involved in HS chain initiation and elongation (15Kim B.-T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J.

Although EXT-Like genes are thought to be involved in the synthesis of HS on the basis of their enzymatic activities in vitro, none have been linked to hereditary multiple exostosis. Therefore, the functions of EXTLs in vivo are still unknown. EXT genes have been well conserved between humans and Drosophila. In Drosophila, three EXT family genes named tout-velu (ttv), sister of tout-velu (sotv), and brother of tout-velu (botv), which encode homologues of human EXT1, EXT2, and EXTL3, respectively, have been identified (19Bellaiche Y.

Moreover, biochemical and immunohistochemical studies in Drosophila have revealed that HS levels are dramatically reduced in the absence of TTV, SOTV, or BOTV (21Takei Y. Ozawa Y. Sato M. Watanabe A.

Nonetheless, in vitro glycosyltransferase activities have been demonstrated only for BOTV/DEXTL3, which harbors both Glc-NAcT-I and GlcNAcT-II activities involved in the initiation and elongation of HS, and no GlcAT-II activity (24Kim B.T.

Here we investigated HS polymerization by using recombinant soluble forms of ttv, sotv, and botv in combination to elucidate the mechanism behind the biosynthesis of HS in Drosophila, and we demonstrated that the polymerization was performed by a complex of TTV and SOTV (TTV-SOTV) as an enzyme source. These results indicated that the mechanism of polymerization by TTV-SOTV was analogous to that recently shown for human EXT1 and EXT2. Moreover, we showed that BOTV/DEXT3 had a critical role as a trigger of initiation of HS synthesis on the tetrasaccharide linkage region. These findings led us to conclude that TTV, SOTV, and BOTV play essential roles in the biosynthesis of HS in Drosophila.

Expression of a Soluble Form of TTV, SOTV, or BOTV—The expression plasmid (10.0 μg) was transfected into COS-1 cells on 100-mm plates using SuperFect® (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For cotransfection experiments, TTV-SOTV, TTV-BOTV, or SOTV-BOTV expression plasmids (5.0 μg each) were cotransfected into COS-1 cells on 100-mm plates using SuperFect® as above. Western Blot Analysis—After 3 days of culture at 28 °C, the culture medium was collected and incubated with 10 μl of IgG-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4°C. The beads recovered by centrifugation were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then resolved on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and incubated for 1 h with mouse IgG antibody. The mouse IgG antibody was diluted 1:1,000 with 25 mm Tris-buffered saline. The bound antibody was detected with mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Measurement of Glycosyltransferase and Polymerization Activities— After a 3-day culture at 28 °C, 10 ml of the culture medium was collected and incubated with 10 μl of IgG-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads recovered by centrifugation were washed with, and then resuspended in, the assay buffer and tested for glycosyltransferase activities as described below. For GlcNAcT activity, the reaction mixture with a total volume of 20 μl contained 10 μl of the resuspended beads, 0.25 mm UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (3.3 × 106 dpm), 100 mm MES buffer, pH 5.8, 10 mm MnCl2, and either GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-C2H4NHCbz (250 nmol) (24Kim B.T.

For GlcAT-II activity, the reaction mixture with a total volume of 20 μl contained 10 μl of the resuspended beads, 0.25 mm UDP-[14C]GlcUA (2.5 × 106 dpm), 100 mm MES buffer, pH 5.8, 10 mm MnCl2, and N-acetylheparosan oligosaccharides, GlcNAc-[GlcUA-GlcNAc]n, with the nonreducing terminal GlcNAc as an acceptor. Polymerization reactions using N-acetylheparosan oligosaccharides, [GlcUA-GlcNAc]n, with the nonreducing terminal GlcUA as acceptors, were conducted in incubation mixtures containing the following constituents in a total volume of 20 μl: 10 μgof N-acetylheparosan oligosaccharides with the nonreducing terminal GlcUA, 0.25 mm UDP-[14C]GlcUA (5.28 × 105 dpm), 0.25 mm UDP-GlcNAc, 100 mm MES buffer, pH 5.8, 10 mm MnCl2, and 10 μlof the resuspended beads. The mixtures were incubated at 30 °C overnight, and the 14C-labeled products were then separated by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 75 column equilibrated and eluted with 0.2 m NH4HCO3. Fractions (0.4 ml each) were collected at a rate of 0.4 ml/min, and the measurement of radioactivity was carried out by liquid scintillation counting. Characterization of the Reaction Products—Products of polymerization reactions on N-acetylheparosan oligosaccharides, [GlcUA-GlcN-Ac]n, with the nonreducing terminal GlcUA were isolated by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column with 0.2 m NH4HCO3 as the eluent. The radioactive peak containing the TTV and SOTV reaction product was pooled and evaporated to dry. The [14C]GlcUA-labeled oligosaccharide chains were exhaustively digested with 30 mIU of heparitinase I in a total volume of 50 μl of 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 2 mm calcium acetate at 37 °C overnight. The enzyme digest was analyzed using the Superdex 75 column as described above. Measurement of Polymerization on a Linkage Region Oligosaccharide Analogue by TTV, SOTV, and BOTV—First, a GlcNAc transfer reaction was conducted using the linkage region oligosaccharide analogue, GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-C2H4NHCbz (250 nmol) as an acceptor (24Kim B.T.

Chem. 2002; 277: 13659-13665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), in an incubation mixture containing the following constituents in a total volume of 20 μl: 10 μl of the soluble form of BOTV-bound beads as enzyme source, 0.25 mm UDP-GlcNAc, 100 mm MES buffer, pH 5.8, 10 mm MnCl2. The reaction products were then added to the polymerization reaction mixture containing the following constituents in a total volume of 40 μl: 0.25 mm UDP-[14C]GlcUA (5.28 × 105 dpm), 0.25 mm UDP-GlcNAc, 100 mm MES buffer, pH 5.8, 10 mm MnCl2, and 10 μlof the resuspended beads (TTV-SOTV, TTV-BOTV, or SOTV-BOTV). Each mixture was incubated at 30 °C overnight, and the 14C-labeled products were then separated by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex peptide column equilibrated and eluted with 0.2 m NH4HCO3. Fractions (0.4 ml each) were collected at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min, and the measurement of radioactivity was carried out by liquid scintillation counting. Expression of TTV and SOTV—In previous studies, three EXT family homologues have been identified and named ttv/DEXT1 (CG10117, GenBank™ accession number AB221351), sotv/DEXT2 (CG8433, GenBank™ accession number AF145598), and botv/DEXTL3 (CG15110, GenBank™ accession number AB077850). The soluble form of BOTV was reported to exhibit GlcNAcT-I and -II activities, which are involved in the initiation and elongation of HS, but showed no GlcAT-II activity (24Kim B.T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13659-13665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, no such glycosyltransferase activities have been detected so far for TTV or SOTV at the optimal temperature (37 °C) for BOTV. We speculated that TTV and SOTV proteins might be unstable at 37 °C. To clarify whether TTV and SOTV are expressed, we performed Western blotting using soluble forms of singly expressed TTV, SOTV, and BOTV, and we cotransfected TTV with SOTV (TTV-SOTV). These proteins were expressed in COS-1 cells at 37 or 28 °C as fusion constructs tagged with protein A to facilitate their separation from endogenous proteins as described under “Experimental Procedures.” When the expression plasmids were expressed in COS-1 cells at 37 °C, no TTV, SOTV, and TTV-SOTV proteins were detected (Fig. 1A, 1st, 2nd, and 4th lanes), although the marked expression of a BOTV protein of ∼140 kDa was detected (Fig. 1A, 3rd lane). On the other hand, when the expression plasmids were expressed in COS-1 cells at 28 °C, ∼120-kDa bands for TTV, SOTV, and TTV-SOTV proteins were detected in addition to the band for BOTV. Thus, TTV and SOTV proteins were unstable at 37 °C, and so the glycosyltransferase activities of TTV and SOTV could not be detected. Functional Analysis of a Soluble Form of TTV or SOTV—To facilitate the functional analysis of TTV and SOTV, glycosyltransferase activities were measured by using a soluble form of TTV or SOTV as an enzyme source. Each of the protein A-fused proteins expressed in the medium was adsorbed onto IgG-Sepharose beads to eliminate endogenous glycosyltransferases, and the protein-bound beads were then used as an enzyme source. Both bound fusion proteins transferred GlcNAc and GlcUA to N-acetylheparosan oligosaccharides [GlcUA-GlcNAc]n and GlcNAc-[GlcUA-GlcNAc]n, respectively, indicating that TTV and SOTV had GlcNAcT-II and GlcAT-II activities, which are involved in the synthesis of the repeating disaccharide units of HS. Moreover, coexpression of the soluble TTV with the soluble SOTV augmented both GlcNAcT-II and GlcAT-II activities when compared with the expression of TTV or SOTV alone (Table 1). These results were analogous to the findings made for human EXT1 and EXT2 (8Senay C. Lind T. Muguruma K. Tone Y. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M.

However, coexpression of the soluble BOTV with the soluble TTV or SOTV augmented neither GlcNAcT-II nor GlcAT-II activity when compared with the expression of BOTV, TTV, or SOTV alone. These results were consistent with the findings that TTV and SOTV are physiologically associated but do not interact with BOTV (22Han C. Belenkaya Y.T. Khodoun M. Tauchi M. Lin X. Lin X.

Open table in a new tab Identification of Polymerization Products—In our previous study, the polymerization of HS in vitro was demonstrated using EXT1 and EXT2 together as an enzyme source, on an artificial linkage region analogue with a truncated glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage tetrasaccharide, GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-C2H4NHCbz, as an acceptor (9Kim B.-T. Kitagawa H. Tanaka J. Tamura J. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41618-41623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Hence, it was next investigated whether the coexpression of TTV and SOTV shows HS polymerization activity. Unexpectedly, no polymerization was detected on the incubation of TTV-SOTV with GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-C2H4NHCbz, or GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-C2H4-O-naphthalenemethanol as an acceptor in the presence of both UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-[14C]Gl-cUA. It was predicted that because TTV-SOTV might not have chain-initiating GlcNAcT-I activity, the polymerization of HS could not take place on GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-C2H4NHCbz or GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-C2H4-O-naphthalenemethanol, both of which serve as acceptor substrates for BOTV and EXTL3 (15Kim B.-T.

Thus, we investigated whether TTV-SOTV has GlcNAcT-I activity using GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-C2H4NHCbz as an acceptor substrate. As shown in Table 1, no GalN-AcT-I activity was detected by TTV-SOTV as an enzyme source, despite a marked GlcNAcT-I activity shown by BOTV. Therefore, N-acetylheparosan oligosaccharides, [GlcUA-GlcNAc]n, with the nonreducing terminal GlcUA were next evaluated as an acceptor for polymerization reactions using the coexpressed TTV-SOTV as an enzyme source. Most intriguingly, marked HS polymerization was demonstrated by gel chromatography using a column of Superdex 75 (Fig. 2A). The synthesized saccharide chains were around 20-mer in length. The radioactive peaks containing cotransfectant (TTV-SOTV) reaction products were digested with heparitinase I and subjected to gel filtration chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The radiolabeled products were completely digested by heparitinase I, quantitatively yielding a 14C-labeled peak at the position of [14C]GlcUAα1–4GlcNAc, indicating that the polymerization occurred on N-acetylheparosan when TTV and SOTV were coexpressed (Fig. 2B). Moreover, a few saccharide residues, about 6-mer long, were synthesized on N-acetylheparosan when BOTV coexpressed with TTV or SOTV was used as an enzyme source, suggesting that some HS chains were synthesized even in the absence of either TTV or SOTV. The results might account for the residual staining of heparitinase-treated ttv mutant embryos with the 3G10 antibody, which recognizes the heparitinase-generated unsaturated uronic acid epitope (20The I. Bellaiche Y. Perrimon N. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 633-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). To compare the chain length synthesized by all the combinations, the size-defined oligosaccharide, GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-C2H4NHCbz, was used. The linkage region analogue, GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-C2H4NHCbz, was incubated with the recombinant soluble BOTV protein, and then polymerization activity was measured using each of the three combinations, TTV-SOTV, TTV-BOTV, and SOTV-BOTV, as an enzyme source as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 3, HS polymerization was demonstrated by all the three combinations, TTV-SOTV, TTV-BOTV, and SOTV-BOTV. The coexpressed TTV and SOTV polymerized HS chains more efficiently than the coexpressed BOTV and TTV or SOTV. In addition, these results altogether indicated that all three Drosophila EXT family members could together achieve polymerization on a linkage region.FIGURE 3Comparison of HS polymerizing activity of the doubly expressed EXT proteins on the linkage region analogue. Combinations of TTV and SOTV (closed circles), SOTV and BOTV (closed triangles), and TTV and BOTV (open triangles) were each tested as an enzyme source for polymerization reactions. The acceptor substrate was prepared using BOTV as an enzyme source and a linkage region analogue GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-C2H4-O-C2H4NHCbz as acceptor, and this reaction mixture was added to the polymerization reactions. 14C-Labeled polymerization reaction products were isolated by gel filtration on a Superdex peptide column with 0.2 m NH4HCO3 as the eluent. Numbered arrowheads 5K and 14 indicate the eluted position of 5-kDa saccharides; 14, tetradecasaccharides derived from chondroitin, respectively (32Ninomiya T. Sugiura N. Tawada A. Sugimoto K.

So far, these Drosophila EXT family genes named tout-velu (ttv), sister of tout-velu (sotv), and brother of tout-velu (botv), which encode Drosophila homologues of human EXT1, EXT2, and EXTL3, respectively, have been identified (19Bellaiche Y.

Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 1927-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that the polymerization of HS in Drosophila was achieved by an enzyme complex composed of TTV and SOTV (TTV-SOTV), which is analogous to findings made recently for the human EXT1 and EXT2 protein complex (Fig. 4, A and B) (9Kim B.-T. Kitagawa H. Tanaka J. Tamura J. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41618-41623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In contrast to human EXT1-EXT2, which possesses GlcNAcT-I activity for chain initiation, TTV-SOTV exhibited no GlcNAcT-I activity (Table 1), indicating that BOTV/DEXT3, which is an EXT-Like gene and possesses GlcNAcT-I activity, is indispensable for the biosynthesis of HS chains in Drosophila. Thus, all three EXT members in Drosophila, TTV, SOTV, and BOTV, appear to be essential for the biosynthesis of HS. An indispensable role for TTV, SOTV, or BOTV in HS biosynthesis has also been suggested by the observations that the synthesis is diminished or abolished in Drosophila bearing a mutation in ttv, sotv, or botv (21Takei Y. Ozawa Y. Sato M. Watanabe A. Tabata T. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 22Han C. Belenkaya Y.T. Khodoun M. Tauchi M. Lin X. Lin X.

Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 1927-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In addition, mutations in ttv, sotv, and botv seriously impaired Hh, Wg, and Dpp signaling activities as well as the distribution of these morphogens (21Takei Y. Ozawa Y. Sato M. Watanabe A. Tabata T. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Thus, these results also indicate that HS is an important regulator of morphogen signaling and the tissue distribution of these morphogens. Notably, Han et al. (22Han C. Belenkaya Y.T. Khodoun M. Tauchi M. Lin X. Lin X. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 1563-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) demonstrated that botv null embryos exhibited stronger segment polarity phenotypes than sotv null embryos. These results suggested that a mutation in botv led to impaired HS biosynthesis because the mutants do not have GlcNAcT-I activity for chain initiation on the linkage region (Fig. 5B). Also, The et al. (20The I. Bellaiche Y. Perrimon N. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 633-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) reported residual staining with a monoclonal antibody 3G10 in ttv embryos. These reports are consistent with the present finding that HS polymerization occurred when BOTV and TTV or SOTV was used as an enzyme source, although the efficiency of polymerization was low (Fig. 5D). Moreover, Han et al. (22Han C. Belenkaya Y.T. Khodoun M. Tauchi M. Lin X. Lin X. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 1563-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Wg signaling is defective only in the botv mutant or ttv-sotv double mutant but not in the ttv or sotv mutant, whereas the distribution of the Wg morphogen is abnormal in the ttv, sotv, and botv mutants. Despite the existence of a small amount of HS in the ttv or sotv mutant (Fig. 5D), signaling events performed by Wg were abrogated. These results suggested that there might be a threshold amount of HS for the reception of signaling molecules. In mammals, the polymerization of HS occurs with GlcNAc and GlcUA transferred alternately by the action of an enzyme complex consisting of EXT1 (6McCormick C. Leduc Y. Martindale D. Mattison K. Esford L.E. Dyer A.P. Tufaro F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) and EXT2 (7Lind T. Tufaro F. McCormick C. Lindahl U. Lidholt K. J. Biol.

These genes are involved in hereditary multiple exostosis, which is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the formation of a cartilage-capped tumor, caused by mutations in either EXT1 or EXT2 (10McCormick C. Duncan G. Tufaro F. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 481-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). EXT1- and EXT2-deficient mice generated by gene targeting failed to undergo gastrulation and died by embryonic day 8.5. Moreover, embryonic stem cells from EXT1- and EXT2-deficient mice showed a complete loss of HS (28Lin X. Wei G. Shi Z. Dryer L. Esko J.D. Wells D.E. Matzuk M.M. Dev.

Development (Camb.). 2005; 132: 5055-5068Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). These results indicate that EXT1 and EXT2 are essential for both gastrulation and the biosynthesis of HS early in embryonic development. Recently, it has been reported that EXT1 mutant mice generated by the gene trap method (EXT1Gt/Gt) survive to embryonic day 14.5 (30Mitchell K.J. Pinson K.I. Kelly O.G. Brennan J. Zupicich J. Scherz P. Leighton P.A. Goodrich L.V. Lu X. Avery B.J. Tate P. Dill K. Pangilinan E. Wakenight P. Tessier-Lavigne M. Skarnes W.C. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). We revealed that the embryonic fibroblasts from EXT-deficient mice generated by the gene targeting method still produce short HS chains as compared with those from wild-type mice (31Yamada S.

We suggested that because EXT1 gene trap mouse fibroblasts produced small amounts of normal EXT1 transcript, gene trap mice still produce some HS, albeit much less than normal. Thus, the EXT1 gene trap mice survive longer than the EXT1-deficient mice. These results suggested, as in the case of Drosophila, that the amount or length of HS chains is the critical determinant of embryonic mouse development, and the function of HS is altered by the amount or chain length. The family of mammalian EXT genes has been extended by the identification of three EXT-Like genes, EXTL1, EXTL2, and EXTL3 (11Wise C.A. Clines G.A. Massa H. Trask B.J. Lovett M.

In fact, the polymerization of HS on the linkage analogue was achieved by an enzyme complex of EXT1 and EXT2, without the aid of EXTL proteins (8Senay C. Lind T. Muguruma K. Tone Y. Kitagawa H.

Most interestingly, the HS chains synthesized on the linkage analogues by the EXT1-EXT2 complex were much longer than those from naturally occurring HS. Thus, it is predicted that these EXTL proteins might regulate the size of HS chains in vivo. We thank Drs.

Steady state levels of Stat5bWT were ∼3-fold higher than Stat5bA630P in cell extracts prepared with nonionic detergents. Although initial rates of biosynthesis of both proteins were similar, pulse-chase experiments established that the apparent half-life of newly synthesized soluble Stat5bA630P was <15% of Stat5bWT (3.5 h versus >24 h). Stat5bA630P accumulated in cells primarily in cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. Structural analysis of the isolated SH2 domain containing the A630P mutation showed that it resembled the wild-type SH2 segment but that it exhibited reduced thermodynamic stability and slower folding kinetics, displayed an increased hydrophobic surface, and was prone to aggregation in solution. Our results are compatible with a model in which Stat5bA630P is an inactive transcription factor by virtue of its aberrant folding and diminished solubility triggered by a misfolded SH2 domain. The potential for aggregation and formation of cytoplasmic inclusions raises the possibility that Stat5bA630P could produce additional defects through inhibition of proteasome function. A predicted alanine to proline substitution in Stat5b that results in profound short stature, growth hormone insensitivity, and immunodeficiency represents the first natural mutation of this transcription factor in a human.

Sequence-specific transcription factors are modular proteins containing distinct domains that mediate their actions, including the ability to move among different subcellular compartments, to bind to DNA in chromatin in the nucleus, and to interact with transcriptional co-activators, co-repressors, and other regulatory molecules (1Ptashne M.

Stat proteins are found in latent form in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells. They are activated upon ligand binding to its receptor by a series of steps consisting of receptor-initiated tyrosine phosphorylation, dimerization, transport into the nucleus, binding to DNA response elements on target genes, and recruitment of a complex of co-activator proteins that stimulate transcription (2Darnell J.E.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3320) Google Scholar, 3Levy D.E. Darnell J.E.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar). Growth hormone (GH) plays a central role in regulating somatic growth and intermediary metabolism in many vertebrate species, including humans (4Herrington J. Carter-Su C. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 252-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Upon binding to its transmembrane receptor, GH triggers the activation of the receptor-associated tyrosine-protein kinase Jak2, which in addition to recruiting a variety of other signaling molecules leads to the activation of Stats 1, 3, 5a, and 5b (4Herrington J.

Billiard J. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22696-22702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and results in experimental animals have shown that the absence of Stat5b is associated with diminished post-natal growth (11Udy G.B.

Decreased activity through the GH-IGF-I axis causes growth defects in humans that may lead to short stature (13Lopez-Bermejo A. Buckway C.K. Rosenfeld R.G. Trends Endocrinol.

Individuals also have been reported with growth deficiency and inactivating mutations in the genes for IGF-I and its receptor (17Woods K.A. Camacho-Hubner C. Savage M.O. Clark A.J. N. Engl. J.

The recent description of a young woman with markedly impaired growth and a homozygous point mutation in the Stat5b gene predicted to change amino acid alanine 630 to proline within the SH2 domain of the protein (20Kofoed E.M. Hwa V. Little B. Woods K.A. Buckway C.K. Tsubaki J. Pratt K.L. Bezrodnik L. Jasper H. Tepper A. Heinrich J.J. Rosenfeld R.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) prompted us to investigate the biochemical consequences of this inherited defect. Here we demonstrate that Stat5bA630P is an inactive transcription factor. In cells, including those derived from the patient, Stat5bA630P accumulates primarily as stable protein aggregates in cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. The A630P mutation also predisposes the isolated SH2 domain to aggregate in solution under conditions in which the wild-type domain is a monomer. Our observations demonstrate that this individual has a protein folding disorder where the aberrantly folded SH2 domain of the mutant Stat5b molecule triggers primary transcription factor deficiency and protein aggregation. Recombinant Plasmids and Adenoviruses—An expression plasmid in pcDNA3 and an adenovirus encoding NH2-terminal FLAG-tagged rat Stat5bWT have been described previously (10Woelfle J. Billiard J. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22696-22702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), as have an expression plasmid for the mouse GH receptor and for FLAG-tagged rat Stat5bY699F and reporter plasmids HS7-TK-Luc and HS7-IGF P1-Luc (21Woelfle J. Chia D.J. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51261-51266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Codon 630 of FLAG-Stat5bWT was modified by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to produce FLAG-Stat5bA630P in pcDNA3, and an adenovirus encoding this protein under the control of a tetracycline-repressible promoter was prepared and purified as described (10Woelfle J. Billiard J. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22696-22702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). DNA encoding the SH2 domains of Stat5bWT and Stat5bA630P (from codon Asp591 to Glu689) was generated by PCR and cloned into pET-15b (Novagen, San Diego, CA) using NdeI and XhoI restriction sites so that a hexahistidine tag was added to the NH2 terminus. The coding regions of all recombinant plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Transient Transfections—All of the cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech-Cellgro, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2. Preparation of primary dermal fibroblasts from the patient homozygous for the A630P mutation in Stat5b and from a 30-year old female of normal height has been described (20Kofoed E.M. Hwa V. Little B. Woods K.A. Buckway C.K. Tsubaki J. Pratt K.L. Bezrodnik L. Jasper H. Tepper A. Heinrich J.J. Rosenfeld R.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). All transient transfections were performed with TransIT-LT1 (Mirus, Madison, WI) and a protocol from the supplier. Reporter Gene Assays—Cos-7 cells (ATCC CRL-1651) were transfected in 6-well tissue culture dishes with expression plasmids for mouse GH receptor (100 ng), Stat5bWT or Stat5bA630P (100 ng), and the reporter plasmids HS7-TK-Luc or HS7-IGF P1-Luc (250 ng). After 24 h, the cells were incubated in serum-free medium with 1% bovine serum albumin, and recombinant rat GH (final concentration, 40 nm) or vehicle was added. The cell lysates were harvested 18 h later for luciferase assays (Promega, Madison, WI). The results were normalized for total cellular protein. Immunoblotting—Whole cell protein lysates were prepared after washing the cells with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubating on ice for 15 min in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.25 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Igepal CA-630, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) followed by passage through a 22-gauge needle and centrifugation at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C. The protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The indicated insoluble material was suspended in an equal volume of electrophoresis sample buffer containing 2% SDS. Protein samples (30 μg each) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with antibodies as described (10Woelfle J. Billiard J. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22696-22702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), followed by detection with a LiCoR Odyssey infrared imager and version 1.2 analysis software (LiCoR Biosciences, Lincoln, NB). The antibodies were used at the following dilutions: FLAG M2 (Sigma) 1:2000, Stat5b (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) 1:5000, phospho-Stat5 (Upstate Cell Signaling, Lake Placid, NY) 1:2000, tubulin (Sigma) 1:2000, mouse IR680 (LiCoR) 1:5000, and rabbit IR800 (LiCor) 1:5000. GH-stimulated Tyrosine Phosphorylation—Cos-7 cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids for the mouse GH receptor (100 ng) and Stat5bWT, Stat5bA630P, or Stat5bY699F (100 ng). After 24 h, serum-free medium with 1% bovine serum albumin was added for 18 h, followed by the addition of recombinant rat GH (40 nm) or vehicle for 30 or 60 min. The cell extracts (500 μg) were immunoprecipitated with FLAG M2 antibody coupled to agarose beads by incubation overnight at 4 °C with rocking. Pilot immunoblots were performed to equalize concentrations of Stat5b in all lanes. Studies of Stat5b Biosynthesis—Cos-7 cells were infected with a recombinant adenovirus expressing a tetracycline-repressible transcriptional activator. After 24 h, the cells were infected with adenoviruses encoding Stat5bWT or Stat5bA630P under control of a tetracycline-repressible transcriptional activator-activated promoter. Whole cell protein extracts were prepared starting 1 h after infection with the Stat5b adenovirus and assessed by immunoblotting with primary antibodies to FLAG M2 and tubulin. Studies of Protein Stability—Cos-7 cells in 60-mm dishes were transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding either Stat5bWT or Stat5bA630P (500 ng). After 24 h, the cells were incubated in serum-free, methionine-free medium for 30 min, followed by a 15-min pulse in methionine-free medium supplemented with 8 μCi of [35S]methionine and then returned to fresh complete medium (chase). At various chase intervals, cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with FLAG M2 antibody coupled to agarose beads by incubation overnight at 4 °C with rocking. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the dried gels were analyzed by fluorography with En3Hance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). A representative result of four independent experiments is shown in Fig. 2C. Immunocytochemistry—Cos-7 cells in 6-well plates were transiently transfected with expression plasmids for Stat5bWT or Stat5bA630P (500 ng). After 48 h, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 20 °C and permeabilized with a 50:50 mixture of methanol and acetone for 2 min before blocking in 0.25% normal goat serum for >1 h at 20 °C. After the addition of the FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody at 1:2000 dilution in blocking buffer overnight followed by a washing step and incubation in goat anti-mouse IgG1-Alexa 488 at 1:1000 dilution in blocking buffer for 2 h, the images were captured with a Roper Scientific Cool Snap FX CCD camera attached to a Nikon Eclipse T300 fluorescent microscope using IP Labs 3.5 software (Scanalytics, Rockville, MD). Purification of SH2 Domain—Escherichia coli strain BL21 cells transformed with pET15b-Stat5bWT, or pET15b-Stat5bA630P SH2 domains were grown with shaking at 37 °C in LB medium containing ampicillin (200 μg/ml) to an A600 of 0.6-1.0 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h. Purification of the His-tagged SH2 domains from inclusion bodies was as previously described (22Haan S. Hemmann U. Hassiepen U. Schaper F. Schneider-Mergener J. Wollmer A. Heinrich P.C. Grotzinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1342-1348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Upon elution from the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column, the fractions were dialyzed against 100 volumes of refolding buffer (20 mm Na2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) with two buffer changes. Purification and yield were monitored by SDS-PAGE and staining with GelCode blue reagent (Pierce). For gel filtration chromatography and binding studies with 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS), purified samples were used immediately after refolding. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD measurements were performed on an AVIV model 215 CD spectrometer maintained at 4 °C. The spectra were measured from 260 to 200 nm at 0.5-nm intervals. The protein concentration was 18.6 μm, and a path length of 0.1 cm was used. The measurements were averaged over a 3-s time interval at each wavelength. The profiles depicted in Fig. 4 are averages of three independent experiments. Equilibrium folding and unfolding were monitored by CD absorbance at 222 nm upon increasing guanidine HCl concentrations from 0 to 6 m at 0.25 m intervals to obtain free energy differences for each transition as described previously (23Subbian E. Yabuta Y. Shinde U. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14348-14360Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The unfolding transitions best represented two states, native (N) and unfolded (U), as follows,N⇄KNUU The observed ellipticity, Aobs(c), at any concentration of the denaturant is given by the sum of the contributions from the two states as follows,Aobs(c)=AN+AUexp[-(ΔGNUH2O-mNUc)/RT]1+exp[-(ΔGNUH2O-mNUc)/RT] where AN and AU are the ellipticity values of the pure N and U states, respectively, ΔGNUH2O is ΔGNU at 0 m guanidine HCl, and mNUc represents the dependence of the respective free energy changes on c. The data were fitted using Prism Graphpad. Folding Kinetics—The change in fluorescence upon folding-unfolding was used to monitor kinetics. Stopped flow kinetics were measured on a Hi-Tech SF61-DX2 fluorometer using λexcitation of a 295- and 310-nm band pass filter. For these analyses, unfolded proteins (1-4 μm) in 6 m guanidine HCl were rapidly diluted (1:10 ratio) into renaturation buffer. The data were fitted to single and double exponential equations (GraphPad-Prism) to determine folding rate constants. All of the experiments were performed at 23 °C, and the results shown represent the averages of three to six independent replicates. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—The fluorescence measurements were performed on a Photon Technology International spectrometer with a model 810 photomultiplier detection system at 4 °C. The protein samples (2.5 μm) were immediately incubated with ANS (50 μm) for 30 min upon completion of refolding. The proteins were excited at 390 nm, and the emission scan was recorded from 400 to 600 nm. The excitation and emission bandwidths were maintained at 10 nm throughout the experiments. For the intrinsic fluorescence experiments, the protein samples (5 μm) were excited at 295 nm, and the emission scans were recorded from 300 to 400 nm. Gel Filtration Chromatography—Soluble protein (250 ml at 1 mg/ml) was applied to a Superdex S200 HR10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated with 20 mm Na2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The proteins were eluted at 20 °C using a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The elution was monitored at 280 nm using a Beckman Gold 166 UV-visible detector. Molecular Modeling—Modeling was performed using Swiss Model, a program that predicts structures reliably (root mean square deviation < 2 Å) for sequences with at least 50-60% identity, using coordinates from the crystal structure of human Stat1 (Swiss Protein Database 1YVL) as the template (24Chen X. Vinkemeier U. Zhao Y. Jeruzalmi D. Darnell J.E.J. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 93: 827-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Absent Transcriptional Activity and Diminished Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Stat5bA630P after GH Treatment—The overall domain structure of Stat5b is pictured in Fig. 1A. To study the consequences of the A630P substitution within the SH2 domain of the protein, we engineered the mutation into FLAG epitope-tagged rat Stat5b, which is 96% identical to the human protein (25Lin J.X. Mietz J. Modi W.S. John S. Leonard W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10738-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and generated recombinant expression plasmids and adenoviruses. In initial experiments we addressed the potential transcriptional properties of the mutant protein and the effects of acute GH treatment on its tyrosine phosphorylation after transient transfection with the GH receptor into Cos-7 cells. As seen in Fig. 1B, in cells expressing Stat5bA630P, GH had no stimulatory effect on the activity of reporter genes containing a GH-responsive element from the rat IGF-I gene (21Woelfle J. Chia D.J. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51261-51266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In contrast, hormone treatment led to a 4- or 7-fold rise in reporter gene expression in cells transfected with Stat5bWT. The earliest event in GH-stimulated activation of Stat5b is recruitment of the protein to the tyrosine-phosphorylated cytoplasmic tail of the GH receptor, followed by phosphorylation of tyrosine 699 of Stat5b by receptor-associated Jak2 (4Herrington J. Carter-Su C. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 252-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 5Horvath C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 496-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 1C, GH caused rapid and robust tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5bWT but had a minimal effect on Stat5bA630P, because levels of its tyrosine phosphorylation were barely above those of the nonphosphorylated Stat5bY699F mutant. Thus, based on these results, Stat5bA630P is transcriptionally inert secondary to its inability to be activated by GH. Diminished Expression of Stat5bA630P Is Secondary to Its Decreased Stability—Analysis of steady state protein levels in transfected Cos-7 cells revealed that the amount of Stat5bA630P was only ∼30-35% of Stat5bWT (Fig. 2A). Treatment with GH had no effect on the accumulation of either protein (data not shown). Assessment of the biosynthetic rates of each transcription factor after infection of Cos-7 cells with recombinant adenoviruses showed that each protein could be detected within 2 h of infection, but that Stat5bA630P reached constant levels sooner than Stat5bWT (8 versus <24 h), and that its apparent concentration at steady state was reduced by ∼70% compared with Stat5bWT (Fig. 2B). Evaluation of protein half-life by pulse-chase assays demonstrated that Stat5bWT was a fairly long-lived protein, with a T1/2 > 24 h, whereas Stat5bA630P appeared to be short-lived, with a T1/2 of ∼3.5 h (Fig. 2C and data not shown). Thus, at least in transfected cells, in addition to being transcriptionally silent secondary to reduced activation by GH, Stat5bA630P appears to turn over at least seven times faster than Stat5bWT. Stat5bA630P Accumulates in Cells in Insoluble Protein Aggregates That Interfere with Proteasomal Function—We next addressed the mechanism of apparently increased turnover of Stat5bA630P by assessing the potential role of lysosomal or proteasomal degradation. Neither steady state protein levels nor the T1/2 of either Stat5bWT or Stat5bA630P were altered by incubation of cells with a variety of lysosomal and proteasomal inhibitors including chloroquine, MG132, and N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO (where Nle is norleucine; data not shown). Some disease-associated proteins when mutated, including the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (26Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1745) Google Scholar), rhodopsin (27Saliba R.S. Munro P.M. Luthert P.J. Cheetham M.E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2907-2918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Illing M.E. Rajan R.S. Bence N.F. Kopito R.R. J. Biol.

Neuron. 2002; 35: 819-822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), have been shown to be misfolded, and at least when overexpressed, form insoluble protein aggregates in cells (26Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1745) Google Scholar). To determine whether Stat5bA630P is prone to aggregation, we looked for accumulation of the protein in the “insoluble” fraction after extraction of transfected cells with buffer containing primarily nonionic detergents. As seen in Fig. 3A and in contrast to Stat5bWT and tubulin, which were found exclusively in the soluble fraction, over 80% of Stat5bA630P was located in the insoluble portion and could be solubilized fully only with high concentrations of ionic detergents. Analogous results were observed when transfected Cos-7 cells were evaluated by immunocyto-chemistry. In the absence of GH, Stat5bWT was found throughout the cytoplasm in a diffuse and uniform pattern, whereas Stat5bA630P was concentrated in multiple discrete cytoplasmic inclusions (Fig. 3B), which have been termed “aggresomes” when detected previously in cells expressing proteins prone to misfolding (26Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1745) Google Scholar). To determine whether aggregates of Stat5bA630P occurred in an endogenous setting, we examined skin fibroblasts derived from the index patient. As pictured in Fig. 3C, unlike cells from an individual expressing Stat5bWT, where the protein was found only in the soluble fraction, in the fibroblasts of the patient ∼90% of Stat5bA630P was located in the insoluble portion. By contrast, in cells from both individuals highly related Stat5a (91% identical to Stat5b (25Lin J.X. Mietz J. Modi W.S. John S. Leonard W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10738-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar)) partitioned to the soluble fraction. We were unable to observe inclusion bodies in the cells of the patient by immunocytochemistry (data not shown), a finding that we interpret as secondary to low levels of expression of Stat5b in fibroblasts. Based on our results, the accumulation of Stat5bA630P in an insoluble protein complex is an inherent property of the mutant protein and is not just induced by its overexpression in Cos-7 cells. Several studies have suggested that proteins that aggregate may disrupt proteasome function, leading to alterations in metabolism of short-lived cellular proteins (30Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar, 31Bennett E.J. Bence N.F. Jayakumar R. Kopito R.R. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 351-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). To determine whether Stat5bA630P could cause gain-of-function abnormalities secondary to diminished proteasomal activity, we examined in Cos-7 cells steady state levels of co-expressed MyoD, a muscle-specific transcription factor with a T1/2 of <30 min (32Abu Hatoum O. Gross-Mesilaty S. Breitschopf K. Hoffman A. Gonen H. Ciechanover A. Bengal E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5670-5677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As pictured in Fig. 3D, Stat5bWT had no effect on levels of MyoD, whereas co-expression with Stat5bA630P led to a >10-fold increase in its abundance, similar to that seen after incubation with the proteasome inhibitor N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO. Based on these results, it is possible that some of the pathological changes observed in the individual with the homozygous Stat5bA630P mutation are secondary to alterations in levels of selected proteins because of diminished proteasome function. Misfolding of the Isolated SH2 Domain of Stat5bA630P—To understand how the A630P mutation might perturb the structure and function of the SH2 domain, we cloned, expressed, and characterized the isolated SH2 domains of wild-type and mutant human Stat5b. Both proteins were purified from an E. coli expression system to >95% purity (data not shown) and refolded as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We first an"

Chemokine-like factors produced by such inflammatory sites are key mediators of tumor growth that activate leukocytic recruitment and tumor infiltration and suppress immune surveillance. Here we report that the endocrine peptide hormone, relaxin, is a regulator of leukocyte biology with properties important in recruitment to sites of inflammation. This study uses the human monocytic cell line THP-1 and normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells to define a novel role for relaxin in regulation of leukocyte adhesion and migration. Our studies indicate that relaxin promotes adenylate cyclase activation, substrate adhesion, and migratory capacity of mononuclear leukocytes through a relaxin receptor LGR7-dependent mechanism. Relaxin-stimulated cAMP accumulation was observed to occur primarily in non-adherent cells. Relaxin stimulation results in increased substrate adhesion and increased migratory activity of leukocytes. In addition, relaxin-stimulated substrate adhesion resulted in enhanced chemotaxis to monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. These responses in THP-1 and peripheral blood mononuclear cells are relaxin dose-dependent and proportional to cAMP accumulation. We further demonstrate that LGR7 is critical for mediating these biological responses by use of RNA interference lentiviral short hairpin constructs. In summary, we provide evidence that relaxin is a novel leukocyte stimulatory agent with properties affecting adhesion and chemomigration.

Complex interactions between tumor cells and the immune system regulate disease progression by stimulating cell proliferation, neovascularization, tissue remodeling, and metastasis or by inhibiting the host anti-tumor immune response (1Coussens L.M. Werb Z. Nature. 2002; 420: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (11050) Google Scholar). However, the factors produced by tumor cells that affect their immune surveillance remain to be fully elucidated. The insulin-related peptide hormone, relaxin, possesses key features required of a tumor-derived factor capable of affecting malignant progression, and its emerging role as a putative mediator of tumor progression has been recently reviewed (2Silvertown J.D. Summerlee A.J. Klonisch T. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 107: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In humans, relaxin is encoded by three genes designated H1, H2, and H3 (3Bathgate R.A.

Functionally, relaxin is classically described to improve blood supply to multiple organs including the uterus, mammary gland, lung, and heart (4Bani D. Gen. Pharmacol. 1997; 28: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Relaxin is also known to increase matrix metalloproteinase expression, resulting in collagen turnover of reproductive tissues and in models of fibrosis, and is responsible for lengthening of the interpubic ligament during delivery (3Bathgate R.A.

A role for relaxin in cancer progression was first suggested 38 years ago by studies indicating that carcinogen-fed rats experienced substantially enhanced mammary tumor growth when co-treated with relaxin several weeks later (6Plunkett E.R. Gammal E.B. Br. J. Cancer. 1967; 21: 592-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). More recently, relaxin has been shown to support growth and invasiveness of breast cancer cells (7Sacchi T.B.

Reprod. 2002; 8: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and elevated relaxin serum levels are positively correlated with breast cancer metastases (9Binder C. Simon A. Binder L. Hagemann T. Schulz M. Emons G. Trumper L. Einspanier A.A. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2004; 87: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Relaxin immunostaining has been demonstrated in epithelial and myoepithelial cells of normal and cancerous breast tissue (10Tashima L.S. Mazoujian G. Bryant-Greenwood G.D. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 12: 351-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and significantly higher levels of relaxin staining occur in neoplastic breast tissues as compared with normal breast tissue (11Mazoujian G. Bryant-Greenwood G.D. Lancet. 1990; 335: 298-299Abstract PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Similarly, relaxin is produced by the normal prostate (12Ivell R. Hunt N. Khan-Dawood F. Dawood M.Y. Mol.

Sato T. Summerlee A.J. Medin J.A. Int. J. Cancer. 2006; 118: 62-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), whereas we have found that H2 relaxin expression is up-regulated in LNCaP cells undergoing neuroendocrine differentiation (20Figueiredo K.A.

Together, these studies strongly implicate relaxin in breast and prostate cancer progression. Relaxin has been attributed with regulation of several intermediary responses or intracellular signaling events in a variety of cell types. These include cAMP, protein kinase A (21Nguyen B.T. Yang L.

In inflammatory wound sites relaxin also induces vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor production in macrophages (48Unemori E.N. Lewis M. Constant J. Arnold G.

Prevailing questions are whether the ability of tumors to secrete relaxin affects the surrounding stromal and endothelial cells or hematopoietic cells and whether relaxin can stimulate and/or recruit these cells to produce factors that promote tumor survival and growth. Here we demonstrate that relaxin activates adenylate cyclase, promotes substrate adhesion, and proportionally enhances migratory capacity of mononuclear leukocytes in a relaxin receptor LGR7-dependent mechanism. Relaxin-stimulated cAMP accumulation occurs primarily in non-adherent cells, and this responsiveness is lost once the cells have adhered to a substrate. Relaxin alone can promote migration of leukocytes and can also enhance their monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) 2The abbreviations used are: MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cells; RLXH, histidine6-tagged recombinant human H2 relaxin; FSK, forskolin; IBMX, isobutylmethylxanthine; TBP, TATA-binding protein; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; GF109203X, broad spectrum protein kinase C inhibitor; shRNA, short hairpin interfering RNA. 2The abbreviations used are: MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cells; RLXH, histidine6-tagged recombinant human H2 relaxin; FSK, forskolin; IBMX, isobutylmethylxanthine; TBP, TATA-binding protein; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; GF109203X, broad spectrum protein kinase C inhibitor; shRNA, short hairpin interfering RNA. migratory response. These enhanced migratory responses may be a result of relaxin-mediated substrate adhesion in these cells. We also describe for the first time that relaxin can dose-dependently stimulate cAMP accumulation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and that this response is proportional to relaxin-stimulated adhesion and migratory activity. We further demonstrate that LGR7 is critical for mediating these biological responses by use of RNA interference lentiviral short hairpin constructs. These results implicate relaxin as a novel stimulator of leukocyte recruitment. Cell Culture—PBMC were isolated from fresh whole blood obtained from healthy male and female volunteers by density gradient sedimentation in Histopaque (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PBMC were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in RPMI (Invitrogen), and used immediately in subsequent assays. THP-1 cells (ATCC) were cultured in RPMI and 10% fetal bovine serum. All THP-1 cell experiments were performed with cells cultured less than 15 passages that were serum-starved overnight before treatments. Production of Recombinant THP-1 Clonal Populations—Stably infected THP-1 populations were generated by lentiviral infection, stable integration, and expression of short hairpin interfering RNA (shRNA) sequence targeting LGR7 (LGR7 GenBank™ accession number NM_021634). shRNA target sequences of LGR7 were selected according to previously established guidelines (49Paddison P.J.

Caudy A.A. Bernstein E. Hannon G.J. Conklin D.S. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 948-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Recombination reactions (Gateway, Invitrogen) were performed to transfer the target sequences into the Gateway-modified pHR-CMV-eGFP lentiviral vector (51Wu X. Wakefield J.K. Liu H. Xiao H.

Virus-containing conditioned media was collected every 24 h for 2 days, filtered through 2.0-μm pores (Millipore), and immediately used to infect THP-1 cells, which were subsequently sorted by flow cytometry to obtain the enhanced green fluorescent protein tag expression approaching 100%. Of the six shRNA targets created (Supplemental Fig. 1), two, L7–274 (5′-CACCTGAATGTTTGGTCGGTTCTGTGCCAG-3′) and L7–917 (5′-GATTGAAAATCTTCCACCGCTTATATTCAA-3′), which effectively suppressed LGR7 expression in THP-1 cells, are described in these studies. cAMP Assays—5 × 105 cells were treated with 6 His-tagged recombinant human H2 relaxin (RLXH) (20Figueiredo K.A. Palmer J.B. Mui A.L. Nelson C.C. Cox M.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

To control for the RLXH vehicle, all samples were treated with the volumetric equivalent of the nickel column elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, and 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0) as previously described (20Figueiredo K.A. Palmer J.B. Mui A.L. Nelson C.C. Cox M.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2005; 1041: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Non-adhered cells were collected from the media by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (Biotrak ELISA kit, Amersham Biosciences). For analysis of the total population cAMP response, the remaining adhered cells were lysed by pooling with the lysis of the corresponding non-adhered cells. For analysis of THP-1 subpopulations, adhered and non-adhered cells were collected as above and passively lysed separately. Adenylate cyclase activation was measured by competitive cAMP enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Biotrak ELISA kit, Amersham Biosciences) and normalized to cell equivalents by protein content (BCA assay, Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions and expressed as fmol of cAMP/μg of cellular protein. Cell Adhesion and Migration Assays—For adhesion assays, 5 × 105 cells were seeded into wells of 24-well tissue culture dishes and left untreated or treated with RLXH (0.02 ng/ml) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 50 ng/ml) and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Non-adhered cells were removed by decanting and washing the plates three times with RPMI media. For migration assays, 5 × 105 cells were seeded in the upper chamber of 24-well 5-μm transwell cell culture inserts (Costar). Cells were treated with RLXH (0.02 ng/ml), GF109203X (2 μm), FSK (10 μm), and/or MCP-1 (10, 25, or 50 ng/ml). All samples not treated with RLXH received an equivalent volume of the RLXH vehicle unless otherwise stated. Migration on uncoated transwells was performed for 24 h at 37 °C, and migration on laminin-coated transwells was performed for 3 h at 37 °C. The number of adhered or migrated cells was determined by CyQuant DNA binding fluorescence (C-7026, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) (54Jones L.J. Gray M. Yue S.T. Haugland R.P. Singer V.L. J. Immunol. Methods. 2001; 254: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Relative fluorescence was detected at 485-nm excitation and 527-nm emission by plate reading fluorometer (Fluoroskan Accent FL, ThermoLabsystems) and standardized for cell number. Total and percent adhered or migrated cells were calculated for each assay, and pooled results are expressed as adhesion index or migration index, respectively, normalized to cell number of untreated controls. Real Time PCR Analysis—LGR7 mRNA expression of parental and shRNA-expressing THP-1 cells was determined from cells under normal culture conditions. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), DNase-treated (Invitrogen) and used to generate single-stranded cDNAs using Superscript first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA (2 μg) was primed for cDNA synthesis using a random hexamer primer (0.5 μg/μl). The comparative CT (threshold cycle) method was used to measure LGR7 mRNA levels under different treatment conditions using a GeneAmp 5700 Sequence detection system and the GeneAmp 5700 SDS software (Applied Biosystems). The LGR7 primers LGR7-Rfp (5′-CCCCTGTGGGAACATCACA-3′) and LGR7-Rrp (5′-GTTGTCCTCATCGGCCTGATT-3′) and probe (5′-VIC-CTCCTGCACTGTAACGGTGTGGACGACT-TAMRA-3′) were selected using the Primer Express software Version 1.5 (Applied Biosystems). The probe was labeled with a VIC/TAMRA quencher/reporter. A region of TATA-binding protein (TBP) cDNA was amplified using control primer/probe kits from Applied Biosystems. Primer verification analysis was performed to ensure the LGR7/TBP primer pairs had equal amplification efficiencies (data not shown). TBP mRNA was unaffected by lentivirus infection or shRNA expression and was, therefore, deemed a suitable control for normalizing the results to total mRNA levels. The real time PCR reactions were performed using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) such that the LGR7 and TBP base-line CT (threshold cycle) ranges were 5–22 and 5–20, respectively. The threshold log values used in the LGR7 and TBP analyses were 0.03–0.05. Fluorescence-activated Cytometric Analysis—5 × 105 live cells suspended in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline were stained for cell surface LGR7 expression by incubation with 5 μg/ml rabbit polyclonal anti-LGR7 antibody (ab12714, Abcam) for 45 min at 4 °C. To correct for nonspecific IgG background binding to cell surface, a parallel cell aliquot was stained with a rabbit IgG antibody against the intracellular protein, Akt (anti-Akt, 9272, Cell Signaling). After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were treated with a 1:200 dilution of donkey anti-rabbit R-phycoerythrin-conjugated antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then immediately analyzed on flow cytometer (Epics xl-mcl, Beckman Coulter) with Expo32 software (Beckman Coulter) and WinMDI software. Statistical Analysis—Curve fit analysis was performed using SigmaPlot graphics software (SPSS) for linear regression (Fig. 2B) or non-linear, one-site saturation kinetics (Figs. 1A and 3A). Statistical analysis was performed with JMPIN statistical discovery software (SAS Institute). Significant differences among treatments were identified by one-way analysis of variance, and significant differences between multiple pairs of treatments were identified by multi-sample matched paired t-tests analyses at a threshold of p < 0.05 unless otherwise noted in the figure legends.FIGURE 1Relaxin stimulates adenylate cyclase activation and substrate adhesion of THP-1 cells.

Biophysical input generated during normal physiologic loading is a major determinant of bone mass and morphology. Removing skeletal load acutely leads to osteoclast recruitment and bone loss. We have previously shown that biophysical factors generated during loading, such as mechanical strain/deformation and pressure, inhibit osteoclastogenesis in vitro (1Rubin J. Biskobing D. Fan X.

Activation of MAPK signaling cascades is a common early step in translating mechanical force into intracellular signals. ERK1/2 activation follows strain and shear force not only in osteoblasts (5Boutahar N. Guignandon A. Vico L. Lafage-Proust M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30588-30599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 6Inoue D. Kido S. Matsumoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40805-49803Google Scholar, 7Wadhwa S.

Law R. Rong J. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1395-1401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Despite a deceptive commonality of the signal cascade, cells appear to be able to differentiate the incoming signal, assigning a panel of responses to specific inputs. Thus, response to mechanical signals is reminiscent of the variable response to soluble factors that share, for example, the ability to activate the downstream cAMP cascade and yet cause different responses. Changes in the temporal application of stimuli also cause variable responses; for example the response of osteoblasts to continuous parathyroid hormone differs from that seen after intermittent parathyroid hormone (9Rosen C.J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 15: 229-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Similarly, the cellular responses to ERK1/2 activation are not uniform: different levels of force, or different types of force, initiate variable arrays of cellular response. In the case of strain, for instance, when osteoblastic cells are deformed at 8% magnitude (i.e. induction of 8% change in cell length), collagenase-2 expression is induced, an effect predicted to stimulate bone resorption (10Yang C.M.

This osteoblast response contrasts with observations that lower strain levels (<2%) are anabolic and antiresorptive (2Rubin J. Fan X. Biskobing D. Taylor W. Rubin C. J. Orthop. Res. 1999; 17: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 5Boutahar N. Guignandon A. Vico L. Lafage-Proust M.H. J. Biol.

Commun. 1996; 229: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). One possible solution to the differential responses to incoming signals, mechanical or soluble, that activate MAPK cascades may be that the molecules involved in transmitting the MAPK signal are aligned in specific scaffolds within the cell membrane such that MAPK activation at one site might be linked to a unique set of downstream responders (12Hancock J.F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). To investigate early mechanically activated events involved in strain regulation of RANKL that might confer specificity, we turned our attention to signaling molecules proximal to ERK1/2, concentrating on the Ras-GTPase located in the deforming membrane. The Ras subfamily includes the classical Ras proteins H-, K-, and N-Ras (13Ehrhardt A. Ehrhardt G.R. Guo X. Schrader J.W. Exp. Hematol. 2002; 30: 1089-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). While these Ras proteins share downstream targets, they undergo isoform-specific posttranslational modification of the hypervariable COOH termini that is responsible for membrane targeting. Modifications include prenylation (farnesylation and/or geranylgeranylation), proteolysis of the carboxyl-terminal CAAX motif and esterification (14Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). H- and N-Ras proteins are also palmitoylated (14Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), while the polybasic domain of K-Ras is not further prenylated. These modifications direct H- and N-Ras to discrete locations of the plasma membrane, while K-Ras reaches alternate membrane and cytosolic domains through a different transport system (15Bivona T.G. Philips M.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The palmitoyl group of H-Ras laterally associates with the cholesterol and glycosphingolipid of lipid rafts allowing it to become part of the caveolar signaling domain (14Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and indeed H-Ras is predominantly associated with lipid raft microdomains (13Ehrhardt A. Ehrhardt G.R. Guo X. Schrader J.W. Exp. Hematol. 2002; 30: 1089-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 16Prior I.A. Harding A. Yan J. Sluimer J. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). As such, H-Ras has been shown to be a key member of the “signaling centers” associated with the organized membrane system, cholesterol-rich microdomains that can be either lipid rafts or caveolae. In the case of H-Ras, the membrane thus can serve as a platform where MAPK signaling events are both generated and modulated. K-Ras, which is anchored to the membrane through its charged polybasic domain, is not often found in organized membrane (12Hancock J.F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 17Prior I.A. Muncke C. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Here we probe the generation of signal proximal to ERK1/2 activation that follows application of strain to osteoprogenitor cells. We show that downstream regulation of RANKL expression requires activation of a specific isoform of Ras-GTPase, the H-Ras isoform. Finally we show that cholesterol depletion of the lipid membrane inhibits mechanical activation of H-Ras. Materials and Reagents—Antibodies to total ERK1/2 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and those to phosphorylated ERK1/2 from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). Reagents for siRNA were purchased from Ambion, Inc. (Austin, TX) and those for the Ras activation assay from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid NY). Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was from Hyclone (Logan, UT). Other chemicals and supplies were purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal antibody against caveolin-1 was from BD Biosciences. Cell Culture—To generate primary stromal cell cultures, murine marrow cells collected from the tibiae and femurs of 3–5-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were plated in 6-well plates at 1.6 × 106 cells/cm2 as published previously (18Rubin J. Murphy T. Fan X. Goldschmidt M. Taylor W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1452-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). After 60 min non-adherent cells containing the stromal elements were transferred to Bioflex collagen I-coated plates (Flexcell Corp., McKeesport, PA) in α-MEM, 10% FBS. The next day non-adherent cells were discarded; adherent stromal cells were cultured with 10 nm 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D added on day 4 to stimulate RANKL expression. Strain regimens were applied on day 6. Conditionally immortalized murine calvarial cells (CIMC-4, clone 4) cells cloned from calvarial osteoblasts (19Ragab A.A. Nalepka J.L. Bi Y. Greenfield E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C679-C687Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and used prior to passage 21 were maintained in permissive conditions at 33 °C in α-MEM with 10% FBS and 100 units/ml interferon-γ (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ). Prior to experiments, cells were cultured for 1 week in non-permissive conditions (37 °C in MEM, 10% FBS, 1.25 mm glutamine, and 100 mg/ml penicillin/streptomycin). For experiments, cells were plated at a density of 1–2 × 104 cells/cm2 in 6-well strain plates for 3 days and treated with 10 nm 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D for the final 48 h. Application of Mechanical Strain—Uniform equibiaxial mechanical strain was generated using a Flexcell Bioflex instrument (Flexcell Corp., McKeesport, PA) as described previously (20Rubin J. Murphy T. Nanes M.S. Fan X. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C1126-C1132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strain magnitudes were as noted from 0.5 to 2% with strain frequency fixed at 10 cycles per minute (0.17 Hz). Similar plates containing control cultures were kept in the same incubator but not subjected to strain regimens. Assessment of Ras Isoforms and Activation—To measure activation of Ras isoforms, cells were treated with GTP (to activate Ras) and GDP (to inactivate Ras) in the presence or absence of strain. Lysates were cleared after microcentrifugation and allowed to bind with 5–10 μg of immobilized GST-Raf-RBD (Raf's Ras binding domain fused to GST), (Upstate Biotechnology); only activated Ras binds to the Raf-1 beads. The beads were collected, washed, re-suspended in reducing sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. After gel separation of captured Ras-GTP, the activated Ras isoforms were determined using specific anti-Ras antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for immunoblotting. Design of Ras Isoform-specific Silencing RNAs—To assess the role of specific Ras isoforms we used two silencing RNA strategies. With the first method, a single 21-nucleotide sequence was selected that effectively knocked down the gene of interest. Four possible silencing sequences for each Ras in their hypervariable regions (12Hancock J.F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar) were chosen using the Ambion algorithm (www.ambion.com). siRNAs were prepared with the Silencer siRNA construction kit (Ambion). Briefly, three sets of 29-mer oligonucleotides representing the sense and antisense strands of three prospective silencer regions were synthesized. These were complementary to the 21-nucleotide DNA sequence at the 5′ end and contain an 8-nucleotide sequence at the 3′ end of each oligonucleotide complementary to the T7 promoter primer provided in the kit. The 21-nucleotide oligonucleotides were annealed to their complementary oligonucleotide, and dsRNA was prepared by in vitro transcription. The resulting dsRNA was then subjected to RNase A and DNase I treatment as per protocol to achieve the final siRNA product. SiRNAs were also prepared to GAPDH (positive control, Ambion), as well as an oligonucleotide sequence known not to silence any mammalian gene (negative control #1, Ambion) that we refer to as “siRNA-scrambled” or siSCR. Individual siRNAs were transfected into cells at a concentration of 40 nm. A second siRNA strategy was also used to generate “mixtures” of siRNA using the RNase III mixture kit from Ambion. Briefly, a 200-base pair target region of specific Ras genes was amplified using 40-mer gene-specific/T7 promoter PCR primers and gel-purified before overnight transcription of dsRNA with a T7 polymerase. The resultant 200-base pair dsRNA was digested with RNase A and DNase I, column-purified, and further digested with RNase III. The final reaction mix was purified with Ambion's siRNA purification unit and the resulting 15–18-base pair siRNAs used at 50 nm. All siRNAs were transfected into cells at 50% confluence with 2.5 μl of Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) per well of 6-well plates. Real-time PCR to Assess mRNA Species—Analysis of RANKL, GAPDH, and 18 S mRNA were performed as described in Refs. 18Rubin J. Murphy T. Fan X. Goldschmidt M. Taylor W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1452-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar and 21Fan X. Roy E. Zhu L. Murphy T.C. Kozlowski M. Nanes M.S. Rubin J. J. Biol.

H-Ras and K-Ras mRNA species were also relatively quantified by RT-PCR using primers specific for each isoform. For H-Ras primers were as follows: forward, tac att gga aca tca gcc aag; reverse, cag gac agc aca cat ttg ca. For K-Ras primers were as follows: forward, aag tgt gat ttg cct tct ag; reverse, atg ttt tcg aat ttc tcg gac t. Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was evaluated by two-tailed t test, with significance at < 0.05 (GraphPad Prism). Mechanical Strain Activates Ras-GTPase—In an effort to characterize relevant molecules proximal to ERK1/2, we set out to characterize the strain-initiated GTPase activation step in primary murine marrow-derived stromal cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, dynamic strain (2%, 10 cpm) activated total Ras as determined by a pull-down assay for GTP-bound Ras. Cells subjected to 10 min of dynamic strain showed activation of total Ras to nearly the same degree as that caused by addition of saturating amounts of GTP. To define the Ras isoforms responsive to strain at this time point, Ras-GTP was probed with isoform specific antibodies to delineate Ras isoforms. Shown in Fig. 1B, at 10 min, there was significant stimulation of the H-Ras isoform, but N-Ras was unaffected. Mechanical activation of K-Ras activation was present but consistently less than that of H-Ras. Because ERK1/2 is fully rapidly activated by mechanical strain by 10–15 min (18Rubin J. Murphy T. Fan X. Goldschmidt M. Taylor W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1452-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), we examined Ras activation at earlier time points. As shown in Fig. 2A, appreciable activation of both H- and K-Ras was seen after application of strain for 2 min. The amount of activated H-Ras typically showed a greater change than that for K-Ras, and the K-Ras appears to be deactivated sooner than H-Ras. In many experiments, K-Ras activation was simply not appreciable. Lower strain magnitudes also effectively stimulated H-Ras. In Fig. 2B cells were studied after 2-min strain at 0.5 and 1%, resulting in activation of the H-Ras isoform. Ras Activation Is Necessary for Transmitting the Strain Effect to RANKL—Ras activation is dependent on the location of the Ras-GTPase. As Ras proteins are targeted to their various membrane locations by posttranslational modifications of their carboxyl-terminal CAAX domains, inhibition of palmitoylation can be used as a means of inhibiting Ras function. The farnesyltransferase (FTase) inhibitor FTI277 prevents farnesylation of H-Ras and subsequent inactivation at levels 100-fold less than those needed to inhibit K-Ras (22Lerner E.C. Qian Y. Blaskovich M.A. Fossum R.D. Vogt A. Sun J. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26802-26806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). This probably occurs not only because H-Ras is a more efficient substrate for FTase but because K-Ras may be alternatively geranylgeranylated when cellular FTase is inhibited (23James G.L. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). FTI277 was given 24 h prior to straining the cells to allow turnover of membrane Ras. In Fig. 3A, total Ras-GTP is shown in strained and unstrained cells that treated with FTI277. The addition of FTI277 to stromal cells did not change the basal activation state of total Ras, which would be consistent with this state being dependent on K-Ras, which is largely insensitive to this level of FTI277 (22Lerner E.C. Qian Y. Blaskovich M.A. Fossum R.D. Vogt A. Sun J. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26802-26806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, however, strain activation of H-Ras was completely prevented in the presence of the farnesyltransferase inhibitor. The effect of inhibiting farnesyltransferase on the downstream RANKL expression target was examined next. As shown in Fig. 3C, strain decreased RANKL mRNA expression by 40% in a series of three experiments in cultures not treated with FTI277. In cultures with 24-h pretreatment with FTI277 prior to application of strain, unstrained cultures expressed RANKL at a level not significantly different from untreated cells. However, in cultures treated with FTI277, the strain effect was completely abrogated. This result would be expected if a necessary molecule, i.e. H-Ras, was disengaged from the mechanical signaling cascade. siRNA Inhibition of H-Ras Prevents Strain Effects on RANKL—To further confirm the farnesyltransferase inhibition data supporting a role for H-Ras in the mechanorepression of RANKL gene expression, silencing RNA technology was used (24Tuschl T. Borkhardt A. Mol. Interv. 2002; 2: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). To explore the requirement for Ras proteins in transmitting a strain-initiated signal resulting in down-regulation of RANKL, we designed siRNAs against H- and K-Ras using two complementary methodologies. In the first method, a single 21-nucleotide sequence, which effectively knocked down the gene of interest, was used, with nonsense siRNA (here called siSCR) used in transfections as a negative control. As shown in Fig. 4A, the siRNA sequence against H-Ras (“siHRas”: aaa cag gtg gtc att gat ggg) decreased steady state mRNA levels for H-Ras at 24 h after addition of siHRas, resulting in knockdown of the H-Ras protein at 72 h when cells were treated with 40 nm siHRNA. Fig. 4B shows that a similar strategy designed to silence K-Ras (“siKRas”: aac tgg gga ggg ctt tct ttg) was also effective at the mRNA and protein level when cells were treated with 40 nm siHRNA; 20 nm was not effective for siKRas at the mRNA level. A secondary method was also used to genererate specific siRNA mixtures for H- and K-Ras proteins (25Yang D. Goga A. Bishop J.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 252: 471-482PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4C shows that the siRNA mixtures designed against H- and K-Ras resulted in specific knockdown of the desired targets. The efficacy of the 40 nm dose was further analyzed by real-time RT-PCR as shown in Fig. 4D. In the left panel, increasing doses of siHRas dose-dependently inhibited H-Ras mRNA but had no effect on K-Ras mRNA. Similarly, siKRas dose-dependently inhibited its designated target without affecting H-Ras mRNA. siRNA at a dose of 40 nm also effective knocked down specific mRNA and protein in the CIMC-4 cell line, as shown in Fig. 4E. Downstream effects of the siRNA silencing regimens were examined first in primary stromal cells. For these experiments, siRNA was transfected 24 h prior to application of strain to culture wells, and expression of RANKL and 18 S mRNAs analyzed 24 h after continuous application of dynamic strain (18Rubin J. Murphy T. Fan X. Goldschmidt M. Taylor W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1452-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 20Rubin J. Murphy T. Nanes M.S. Fan X. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C1126-C1132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Fig. 5A, the single siRNA strategy was used to specifically silence either H- or K-Ras. The data show the expression of RANKL in each condition compared with the unstrained controls treated with siSCR. siHRas did not change basal expression of RANKL (first bar in the middle set of bars). Silencing of H-Ras completely abrogated the strain effect on RANKL. Importantly, silencing of K-Ras, despite the significant increase in basal RANKL in unstrained cultures, did not prevent the mechanical repression of RANKL by 50% compared with that in unstrained cells. These data reinforce the results gathered from the studies of H-Ras activation in the presence of farnesyltransferase inhibition (Fig. 3C). To complement these data, and that of the effect of the farnesyltransferase inhibition studies, we utilized the siRNA mixtures designed against H- and K-Ras. Again, siRNA against H-Ras did not change the basal expression of RANKL in unstrained cultures, as compared with control cultures that were treated with siGAPDH mixtures that did not affect Ras (Fig. 5B). The effects of mechanical strain in cultures treated with the siRNA mixtures were equivalent to those seen using the single siRNA strategy: siRNA against H-Ras completely abrogated the strain effect, wherease the strain effect was fully preserved in cultures treated with siRNA targeting K-Ras. These results suggest a specific role of H-Ras in strain-induced RANKL repression. Strain Has Analogous Effects on RANKL in the CIMC-4 Pre-osteoblast Cell Line—To inquire whether the requirement for H-Ras transmitting the strain signal to inhibit RANKL was present in another mechanically responsive RANKL-expressing cell, we tested effects of strain in the immortalized pre-osteoblast cell line, CIMC-4. This pre-osteoblast line was generated from cells digested from the calvariae of the large TAg transgenic mouse calvariae (26Jat P.S. Noble M.D. Ataliotis P. Tanaka Y. Yannoutsos N. Larsen L. Kioussis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5096-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Calvarial cells from this mouse have been shown to support osteoclast formation from pre-osteoclast cells after treatment with osteotropic cytokines and vitamin D (19Ragab A.A. Nalepka J.L. Bi Y. Greenfield E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C679-C687Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 27Ragab A.A. Lavish S.A. Banks M.A. Goldberg V.M. Greenfield E.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 970-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For experiments, cells were plated in strain dishes at 37 °C and γ-interferon removed; under these non-permissive conditions there was less than a doubling in the cell population (data not shown). Cells were then subjected to the strain protocol at day 7: strain application caused a similar decrease in RANKL, indeed at a very similar degree to 45 ± 2% that of unstrained cells, as shown in Fig. 6A. Cells responded to strain with an activation of Ras-GTPase. H-Ras was the predominant responding isoform (data not shown). K-Ras levels were quite low in the CIMC-4 cells 1 week after moving them to non-permissive conditions, perhaps consistent with the cessation of cell proliferation. Treatment of CIMC-4 cells with siHRas and siKRas reproduced the effects seen in the primary stromal cells. As shown in Fig. 6B, only siRNA treatment of H-Ras abrogated the ability of the strain to decrease RANKL expression, while cells treated with siKRas continued display strain-induced RANKL repression. Cholesterol Depletion Blunts H-Ras Activation during Mechanical Strain—Since H-Ras has been shown to reside in cholesterol-rich lipid raft microdomains (28Li S. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29182-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar), we inquired whether a spatial arrangement dependent on cholesterol might be important to the ability of mechanical strain to activate the Ras isoforms in bone cells. Cells were treated with methyl-β-cyclodextrin, a membrane-impermeable cholesterol-binding agent that leaches cholesterol out of membranes, destroying lipid raft domains (29Park H. Go Y.M. St. John P.L. Maland M.C. Lisanti M.P. Abrahamson D.R. Jo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32304-32311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 30Kranenburg O. Verlaan I. Moolenaar W.H. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1880-1884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). After application of strain, stromal cell homogenates were first run over GST-Raf-RBD agarose to pull-down activated Ras and then probed with an antibody recognizing all isoforms of Ras. As shown in Fig. 7A, mechanical activation of total Ras at 10 min is inhibited when cholesterol-sensitive compartments in the plasma membrane are depleted. It is perhaps not surprising that in the presence of MβCD that there is increased activation of H-Ras, since alteration of membrane cholesterol is associated with a mild degree of MAPK activation (29Park H. Go Y.M. St. John P.L. Maland M.C. Lisanti M.P. Abrahamson D.R. Jo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32304-32311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 31Galbiati F. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Watanabe G. Burk R. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6633-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Despite this, mechanical strain was unable to further activate the MAPK signaling molecule. To separate the requirement of these compartments to specific Ras isoforms, repeated experiments were probed for H-Ras, as shown in a representative experiment in Fig. 7B. Full strain activation of H-Ras was prevented by MβCD pretreatment. The multiplicity of signals that are initiated by mechanical forces at the cell membrane is reminiscent of the many signals generated by ligand-receptor binding. How a cell mounts a specific response to a barrage of incoming signals that share intracellular pathways has been enigmatic. One clue to deciphering the use of common signals to generate specific response has been recent understanding that signal encryptation can arise from spatial organization, e.g. the site of signal activation can be critical (12Hancock J.F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 16Prior I.A. Harding A. Yan J. Sluimer J. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). In explicating the response of the osteoprogenitor cell to mechanical strain in terms of the repression of the osteoclastic signal RANKL, we have here described a very specific intracellular response that emanates from the H-Ras isoform of Ras-GTPase. This Ras isoform has been shown to be located within lipid rafts (16Prior I.A. Harding A. Yan J. Sluimer J. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 32Niv H. Gutman O. Kloog Y. Henis Y.I. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and thus organization of membrane microdomains may be critical to the specific mechanical response. Strain, along with shear, is known to activate Ras, and inhibition of Ras function prevents some downstream mechanical effects (8Jo H. Sipos K. Go Y.M. Law R. Rong J. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1395-1401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 33Jalali S. Li Y.S. Sotoudeh M. Yuan S. Li S. Chien S. Shyy J.Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Biol. 1996; 16: 5947-5954Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Ras activation, however, can lead to many different cellular effects, including proliferation (5Boutahar N. Guignandon A. Vico L. Lafage-Proust M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30588-30599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) or change in phenotype (35Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 243-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). These variable effects may be explained by activation of specific Ras isoforms. We have here proved that the H-Ras isoform is specifically required for mechanorepression of RANKL gene expression. Inhibition of farnesyltransferase, which is necessary for proper trafficking of H-Ras to its membrane destination (15Bivona T.G. Philips M.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), prevents both mechanical activation of H-Ras and the downstream effect of strain on RANKL expression. Pharmacologic inhibitor data are supported by the use of siRNA knockdown of H-Ras, which completely blocks strain inhibition of RANKL expression. Importantly, siRNA knockdown of the K-Ras isoform has no effect on the strain repression of RANKL. The requirement for H-Ras is also true for mechanorepression of RANKL in the pre-osteoblast CIMC-4 cell line. The CIMC-4 line was harvested from a transgenic mouse containing the large T-Ag (26Jat P.S. Noble M.D. Ataliotis P. Tanaka Y. Yannoutsos N. Larsen L. Kioussis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5096-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar) and responds to osteoclastogenic signals by increasing its ability to support osteoclast differentiation (19Ragab A.A. Nalepka J.L. Bi Y. Greenfield E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C679-C687Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The pro-osteoclastogenic nature of the line is largely through up-regulation of RANKL expression; 1,25(OH)2D3 induces RANKL in these cells (data not shown), and application of strain represses this expression, as we have shown here. This is the first indication that this cell line is responsive to mechanical forces. Studies of Ras signaling have shown that while the Ras family shares protein effectors, the spatial distribution directed by the individual Ras family member's carboxyl-terminal domain creates non-redundant regulatory pathways. Practically, H-Ras and K-Ras operate in different membrane microdomains. K-Ras is found largely in the disorganized plasma membrane, while H-Ras circulates between cholesterol-rich lipid rafts (i.e. organized membrane) and, upon activation, into the cytosol where a GTP-dependent segregation from lipid rafts is required for biologic activity (16Prior I.A. Harding A. Yan J. Sluimer J. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 30Kranenburg O. Verlaan I. Moolenaar W.H. Curr.

Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Our finding that H-Ras is involved in regulation of RANKL suggested that the site of mechanical signal generation might be within a lipid raft (12Hancock J.F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Indeed, our data showing that H-Ras cannot be activated by strain after membrane cholesterol depletion points to the lipid raft as a required spatial context for translation of mechanical input into diminished RANKL expression. K-Ras signaling may not be affected by depletion of membrane cholesterol, since this isoform does not associate with organized membrane (36Carozzi A.J. Roy S. Morrow I.C. Pol A. Wyse B.

Rolls B. Hancock J.F. Parton R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and inhibition of K-Ras activity in our in vitro systems does not affect the mechanical regulation of RANKL. This suggests that the plasma lipid membrane might underwrite specialization of Ras isoforms by allowing compartmentalization through scaffolded systems. What guanine exchange factor (GEF) is involved in the H-Ras activation, or indeed, how a “ligand-less” process is initiated, is unknown. Most GEFs can activate many members of the Ras subfamily, and even GTPases outside of a subfamily may be affected (13Ehrhardt A. Ehrhardt G.R. Guo X. Schrader J.W. Exp. Hematol. 2002; 30: 1089-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). There is some evidence for that GEFs may be specific in some cases, for instance Ras-GRF 1 and 2 may target only H-Ras (39Jones M.K. Jackson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1782-1787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In our experiments, the GEF does not appear to be specific for H-Ras, as indeed K-Ras is activated by mechanical strain. SOS1 (40Li S. Kim M. Hu Y.L. Jalali S. Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Chien S. Shyy J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30455-30462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) and Gab1 (41Jin Z.G. Wong C. Wu J. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12305-12309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) are activated by shear stress and would be candidates for strain induced signaling. The specific process initiated at the membrane by strain remains an open question. Organized membrane may serve to regulate H-Ras function. In the case of endothelial cells, caveolae have been shown to be necessary to mediate shear-dependent ERK1/2 and eNOS activation (29Park H. Go Y.M. St. John P.L. Maland M.C. Lisanti M.P.

Chem. 1998; 273: 26323-26329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), another case where membrane microdomains are involved in generating mechanical responses. Indeed multiple mechanical signals, for instance both strain/stretch and shear, may activate the same downstream signals, e.g. ERK1/2, as do receptors also present in the organized membrane, but without requiring a receptor. Thus, the relational geometry of signaling proteins within the membrane may represent a mechanotransducer. In summary, our data show that the location of H-Ras within the organized membrane is critical to the mechanical regulation of RANKL. Whether this strict signal processing is required for other mechanically activated genes, or indeed, required to generate clustered gene responses, will be of great interest to our future studies."

In this study, we investigated the function of the LPS-binding protein (LBP) in this process. The cytoplasmic membrane of the cells was mimicked by lipid liposomes adsorbed on mica, and the lateral organization of LBP in these membranes and its interaction with LPS aggregates were characterized by atomic force microscopy. Using cantilever tips functionalized with anti-LBP antibodies, single LBP molecules were localized in the membrane at low concentrations. At higher concentrations, LBP formed clusters of several molecules and caused cross-linking of lipid bilayers. The addition of LPS to LBP-containing liposomes led to the formation of LPS domains in the membranes, which could be inhibited by anti-LBP antibodies. Thus, LBP mediates the fusion of lipid membranes and LPS aggregates. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS; endotoxin) activate immunocompetent cells of the host via a transmembrane signaling process.

Thus, LBP mediates the fusion of lipid membranes and LPS aggregates. Membrane-embedded proteins or serum proteins interacting with membranes very often play a particular role in cell functioning (e.g. in signal transduction induced by various pathogenic factors). In these cases, signaling occurs across the cytoplasmic membrane via one or more transmembrane or membrane-bound proteins. The participating components are usually known; however, their lateral organization and the mechanism of their interaction are unknown. The cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria consists of the cytoplasmic and an additional outer membrane. This outer membrane is an extremely asymmetric bilayer with respect to the lipid composition. The inner leaflet is composed of a phospholipid mixture, and the outer leaflet is composed of glycolipids, in most cases lipopolysaccharide (LPS). 2The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharides; AFM, atomic force microscopy; LBP, LPS-binding protein; MEMO, 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate; MNC, mononuclear cell; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PS, phosphatidylserine; N, Newton. When released from the bacterial surface into the blood circulation of the host, LPS plays an important role in the pathogenesis and manifestation of Gram-negative inflammation, in general, and of septic shock, in particular. It is therefore also named endotoxin. The important biological aim of this study was to get an understanding of an early step in the activation mechanism of immune cells (mononuclear cells, MNCs) by LPS. A comparison of the capacity of LPS monomers and aggregates to induce cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α showed that the aggregates play a biologically important role in the initial step of cell activation (1Mueller M. Lindner B. Kusumoto S. Fukase K. Schromm A.B. Seydel U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26307-26313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). One important step in the signal transduction process is the interaction between LPS and the acute phase serum protein LPS-binding protein (LBP). LBP is synthesized by hepatocytes (2Ramadori G. Meyer zum Buschenfelde K.H. Tobias P.S. Mathison J.C. Ulevitch R.J. Pathobiology. 1990; 58: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and different epithelial cells (3Vreugdenhil A.C.

Immunol. 2004; 172: 6185-6194Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Our group provided evidence for binding of LBP to and intercalation into lipid membranes composed of negatively charged phosphatidylserine (PS) or zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine (PC) and also in LPS aggregates by using fluorescence resonance energy transfer and surface plasmon resonance experiments (10Gutsmann T. Muller M. Carroll S.F. MacKenzie R.C. Wiese A. Seydel U. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 6942-6950Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we also provided evidence for a directed transmembrane configuration of LBP within symmetric phospholipid bilayers, mimicking the cytoplasmic membrane, by electrical measurements on reconstituted planar membranes (11Gutsmann T. Haberer N. Seydel U. Wiese A. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because of our results, it is likely that LBP is not only present as an acute phase protein in serum but also assumes a transmembrane configuration in the cytoplasmic membrane of immune cells and in this configuration acts as fusion protein for LPS aggregates. Depending on its concentration, LBP plays a dual role in vivo as well as in vitro; it can both potentiate and decrease cell response to bacterial LPS. Whereas at low concentrations, LBP causes an increase of the cell activating capacity of LPS, at high LBP concentrations, it causes a decrease of LPS-induced cell responses (10Gutsmann T. Muller M. Carroll S.F. MacKenzie R.C. Wiese A. Seydel U. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 6942-6950Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 12Lamping N. Dettmer R. Schroeder N.W.J. Pfeil D. Hallatschek W. Burger R. Schumann R.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2065-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The inhibitory mechanism is discussed controversially. In part, it can be explained by the ability of LBP to neutralize the bioactivity of LPS by transferring it to plasma lipoproteins (13Vesy C.J. Kitchens R.L. Wolfbauer G. Albers J.J. Munford R.S. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 2410-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 14Wurfel M.M. Kunitake S.T. Lichenstein H. Kane J.P. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1025-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). However, further inhibitory mechanisms are likely to occur, because LBP can inhibit LPS-induced cell activation also under serum-free conditions (10Gutsmann T. Muller M. Carroll S.F. MacKenzie R.C. Wiese A. Seydel U. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 6942-6950Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Possible mechanisms might include the formation of large complexes of LPS and LBP (LPS + LBP) with an increased binding energy of the LPS in these complexes (15Gegner J.A. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5320-5325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Other data support the hypothesis that LBP can reduce cell response to LPS by inhibiting LPS transfer to mCD14 and finally to the Toll-like receptor 4/MD-2 signaling receptor (7Thompson P.A. Tobias P.S. Viriyakosol S. Kirkland T.N. Kitchens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28367-28371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this work, we investigated the orientation and the lateral organization of LBP after intercalation into reconstituted lipid membranes and the LBP-mediated intercalation of endotoxin into these membranes by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The host cell membrane was mimicked by lipid liposomes prepared of PC or PS. This membrane reconstitution system reduces the complex biological membrane and, thus, allows us to investigate the interaction mechanisms on a molecular level. After preincubation of the liposomes with LBP and in the presence and absence of lipid A, they were adsorbed on mica. The AFM (16Binning G. Quate C.F. Gerber C. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1986; 56: 930-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (12555) Google Scholar) allows us to acquire the surface topography of biological samples under native conditions in buffer with high resolution (17Schabert F.A. Henn C. Engel A. Science. 1995; 268: 92-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 18Müller D.J. Engel A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1347-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In addition to the ability of the AFM technique to image surfaces, we used this technique for force spectroscopy experiments to investigate the thickness of membranes, showing that LBP induced a cross-linking of several membranes. Functionalized cantilevers with antibodies bound to their tip by 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate (MEMO) were used for the localization of specific proteins on the surface (19Stroh C. Wang H.

Hinterdorfer P. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Binding experiments between single LBP molecules, embedded in the lipid matrix, and the modified tip were performed. These experiments clearly identified LBP as a membrane-embedded protein forming domains of several molecules at higher concentrations. Our data provide clear evidence that LBP mediates the fusion between lipid membranes and LPS aggregates that might be an important initial step in the activation of MNCs (22Dunzendorfer S. Lee H.K. Soldau K. Tobias P.S. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 1166-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Atomic Force Microscopy—Imaging was performed with an MFP-3D atomic force microscope from Asylum Research (Santa Barbara, CA) in an aqueous environment. The AFM was placed on an inverted optical fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX70, Tokyo, Japan), and the setup was located on an air-buffered graphite table. Imaging in AC mode was performed with MSCT-AUNM silicon nitride cantilevers with a spring constant k ≈ 0.1 N/m and a resonant frequency fres ≈ 38 kHz in air (Veeco Instruments GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Imaging in liquid was performed in AC (tapping) mode using frequencies of about 8 kHz. The frequency was chosen to result in an amplitude 5% lower than the amplitude at the resonance frequency. The set point was always adjusted to guarantee minimum forces applied to the sample. Further image processing (flattening and plane fitting) was done with the MFP-3D software under IGOR Pro (Lake Oswego, OR). The sample was placed on mica glued to a small Petri dish top (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany). Force spectroscopy was performed in an aqueous environment with an AC240TS cantilever (k = 2 N/m, fres, air = 70 kHz; Olympus Optical Co., Ltd. Tokyo, Japan). AFM images of single LBP molecules adsorbed on mica were obtained in DC (contact) mode using a MultiMode III setup (Veeco/Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA) and the MSCT-AUNM cantilever. Lipids and Proteins—PS and PC from egg yolk lecithin (sodium salt) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) and Sigma, respectively, and were used without further purification. For the formation of lipid A aggregates, lipid A from Salmonella enterica serovar Minnesota (S. minnesota) strain R595 (R595 LPS) (chemical structures according to Ref. 23Wiese A. Münstermann M. Gutsmann T. Lindner B. Kawahara K. Zähringer U. Seydel U. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 162: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) was used. LPS was extracted by the phenol/chloroform/petroleum ether method (24Galanos C. Lüderitz O. Westphal O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 9: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar), purified, lyophilized, and transformed into the triethylamine salt form. Lipid A was isolated from LPS by acetate buffer (pH 4.4) treatment (0.1 m, 100 °C for 1-3 h). For the preparation of liposomes or aggregates, the phospholipids were dissolved in chloroform and lipid A in a chloroform/methanol 10:1 (v/v) solution; the solvents were evaporated under a stream of nitrogen; and the phospholipids and lipid A, respectively, were resuspended in 5 mm Hepes (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) at pH 7 to a final concentration of 1 mm and sonified for 1 min (Branson-Sonifier, Hensenstamm, Germany). This procedure was followed by a heating cycle (4, 50, and 4 °C, each for 30 min). The recombinant human holoprotein LBP (molecular mass 53,349 Da) was prepared according to the method described before (25Theofan G. Horwitz A.H. Williams R.E. Liu P.-S. Chan I. Birr C. Carroll S.F. Mészáros K. Parent J.B. Kasler H. Aberle S. Trown P.W. Gazzano-Santoro H. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3623-3629PubMed Google Scholar) and was a kind gift from Xoma Corp. (Berkeley, CA). It was stored in aliquots (1 mg/ml 10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% F68, 0.002% Tween 80, pH 7.5) at -70 °C. For incubation with liposomes, LBP was diluted to 2 and 0.02 nm, respectively. LBP Antibody—The monoclonal αLBP antibody biG33 was purchased from Biometec (Greifswald, Germany) and stored at -20 °C at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Attachment of biG33 to the cantilever was performed according to the Cai and Yang method (26Cai X.-E. Yang J. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 357-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cantilever was incubated for 30 min in a HCl/CH3OH solution (1:1 v/v), resulting in the presence of surface silanols. The cantilevers were then rinsed with methanol and silanized with 0.5% methanol-diluted MEMO for 45 min, followed by extensive rinsing with methanol and purified water. Finally, the cantilevers were incubated in a solution containing 0.2% ammonium peroxodisulfate by weight, 0.2% N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylendiamine by volume and 5 μg/ml antibody for 45 min. Preparation of Liposome-derived Bi-/Multilayers—2 ml of phospholipid liposomes (100 μm) were placed on the freshly cleaved mica glued into the lid of a Petri dish. The liposomes were then stored overnight on a shaker at 4 °C. For further use, the preparation was washed intensively with 5 mm Hepes, at pH 7, taking care that the formed lipid layer was not exposed to air. Preincubation of one or more components was always performed for 10 min at 37 °C. Single LBP Molecules on Mica—LBP was physiosorbed from 200 pm solutions in deionizied water on mica and imaged in air. LBP molecules adsorbed mainly as individual molecules, showing a stretched conformation with a length of about 10 nm, a width of about 4 nm, and a height of 2-3 nm (Fig. 1A). This shape and the dimensions are in good agreement with the calculated structure of LBP (27Beamer L.J. Carroll S.F. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 906-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). LBP Molecules Intercalated in Lipid Matrices—Imaging bilayers solely composed of PS or PC exhibited flat surfaces with maximal height differences of <0.4 nm. The thickness of the bilayers was 5 ± 0.5 nm. This value was determined by scratching off the bilayer from the mica surface using low force to avoid destruction of mica layers (Fig. 1B). The subsequent addition of 2 nm LBP to already formed PS bilayers led to small elevations of 2-3 nm, with a length of ∼22 nm and a width of ∼15 nm (Fig. 1C). Preincubation of PS liposomes (100 μm) with 2 nm LBP ([LBP]/[PS] = 1:5·104, m/m) prior to the adsorption process onto the mica surface led to formation of circular domains with a diameter of ∼200 nm and a mean height of ∼2 nm (maximum of 10 nm) in the lipid bilayers (Fig. 1D). Analogous experiments using PC liposomes yielded comparable results with a slightly decreased number of domains (data not shown). The formation of these nanodomains was concentration-dependent. At an LBP concentration of 20 pm ([LBP]/[PS] = 1:5·106, m/m), no domains or individual molecules could be detected in/on the membranes in height images. At concentrations up to 2 μm LBP, the number of domains and with that the roughness of the images increased; the size of the domains, however, remained unchanged (data not shown). Experiments with different molar ratios of [LBP]/[PS] were performed in the range of 1:5·101 to 5·106 m/m. Several images of the same position did not show any time-dependent changes of the topography; thus, it is unlikely that adsorption of molecules occurred during scanning. LBP-induced Formation of Multilayers—Beside scratching off the bilayer from the mica, force spectroscopy allows the determination of the thickness of the lipid layers adsorbed onto the mica surface. In Fig. 2, a representative force spectroscopy experiment is shown for (PS + LBP) layers prepared from 100 μm PS liposomes preincubated with 2 nm LBP for 15 min at 37 °C. Approaching the surface, the force between the cantilever tip and the sample started to increase at a distance of about 40 nm from the mica surface. Thus, the preincubation of PS liposomes with LBP led to the formation of multilayers of at least six lipid bilayers. After reaching a plateau, a further increase of the force was observed at distances of <6 nm from the mica surface. This effect probably resulted from the bilayer adsorbed directly onto the solid support. Also, the preincubation of 100 μm lipid A aggregates with 2 nm LBP led to the formation of multilayers. However, the surface was very rough, and the thickness of the multilayers assumed values up to 3 μm (data not shown). Detection of LBP in the Lipid Matrix by Force Spectroscopy—The observation that no LBP molecules could be detected in PS preparations from liposomes preincubated with LBP at a low concentration ([LBP] = 20 pm, [LBP]/[PS] = 1:5·106, m/m) (Fig. 3A) may have different reasons: (i) the LBP concentration is too low to observe individual molecules, (ii) the lateral diffusion of LBP molecules in the bilayer is too high to localize them with the AFM, or (iii) the molecules are embedded in the lipid matrix, and the height difference between LBP molecules and the PS membrane is below the resolution of the AFM. To clarify this important question, a chemically modified cantilever was used, and the same sample was imaged again. Scanning with the modified MSCT-AUNM cantilever led to “force images” showing areas with stronger interaction between the cantilever tip than observed with pure PS bilayers (Fig. 3B). The areas in the height image, where the antibody and/or the linker molecule bound to LBP, appear higher, because the amplitude is reduced by the specific interaction. This effect leads to a retraction of the cantilever by the feedback loop of the AFM, resulting in higher height values. Thus, these images may be called force or recognition images (19Stroh C. Wang H. Bash R. Ashcroft B. Nelson J. Gruber H. Lohr D. Lindsay S.M. Hinterdorfer P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12503-12507Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Force spectroscopy with the functionalized cantilever was performed on pure PS membranes or on LBP-containing PS membranes outside the regions in which LBP was detected. The respective force images show only binding interactions in a range of 0-20 nm (Fig. 4A, black curve). In comparison, the force curves performed in the regions showing stronger interactions in the force images (Fig. 4A, gray curve) or anywhere on (PS + LBP) layers completely covered with LBP molecules (Fig. 4B, two representative curves) exhibited the interaction with the PS bilayer and, moreover, the rupture of bonds at distances of about 20-60 nm. The latter were caused by interactions between the antibodies and/or the linker and the LBP molecules in the membrane. The average binding force was (127 ± 20) pN at a pulling velocity of 0.77 μm/s (Fig. 4C). The distribution had a width of (52 ± 25) pN.FIGURE 4Force spectroscopy of LBP binding to a modified cantilever. A, a force-distance curve on a pure PS bilayer (a) exhibits only an unspecific binding behavior between the cantilever, which has been modified with MEMO-linker molecules and αLBP antibodies and PS at a distance of about 0-20 nm from the surface. Also, on the bright spots in Fig. 3B, a specific binding behavior was observed at distances 20-60 nm above the surface (b). B, on (PS + LBP) layers prepared from PS liposomes preincubated with LBP with a higher molar LBP concentration ([LBP]/[PS] = 1:5·104, m/m), the specific binding behavior could be observed at any location. C, histogram of the detected specific binding forces. At a pulling velocity of 0.77 μm/s, the binding forces have an average value of (127 ± 20) pN and reach a maximum of about 400 pN. Conditions were as follows: 5 mm HEPES, pH 7, room temperature; [PS] = 100 μm; [LBP] = 20 pm; Cantilever: MSCT-AUNM E (k = 100 mN/m).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) LBP-mediated Incorporation of Lipid A—It is thought that LBP mediates the intercalation of LPS or lipid into cell membranes as an early step in the cell activation by these virulence factors. To investigate this important biological question, PS liposomes were first preincubated with 2 nm LBP, and subsequently lipid A aggregates (50 or 100 μm) were added, and the resulting ((PS + LBP) + lipid A) preparations were then adsorbed on mica. Height images showed two different kinds of structures (Fig. 5, A and B). On the one hand, hemispheres were observed with diameters up to 20 μm and heights up to 16 nm (Fig. 5A), and on the other hand, larger flat structures with heights of ∼1.5 nm (Fig. 5B). Both kinds of structures were also observed after the subsequent addition of lipid A to already formed (PS + LBP) multilayers. Interestingly, the formation of the flat structures could also be created by scanning on the higher hemispheres, demonstrating that in the stack of multilayers the last bilayer is less influenced by the solid support and behaves more like a fluid system. Formation of the observed structures was inhibited by incubation of (PS + LBP) with 100 ng/ml αLBP antibodies for 15 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of lipid A (data not shown). Force-distance curves on the ((PS + LBP) + lipid A) samples (Fig. 5C) showed the formation of multilayers, which were thicker by 10-15 nm than the (PS + LBP) multilayers (Fig. 2). It is an essential capability of all cells to respond in a certain manner to external stimuli. This response involves various signal transduction pathways comprising different proteins, some of which are located at or in the cytoplasmic membrane and are responsible for transmembrane signaling. In past years, different methods have been developed to localize these signaling proteins and to characterize their functions. Thus, different light microscopic fluorescence techniques allow the localization of proteins at a lateral resolution in the range of 30 nm and more (28Schmidt T. Schütz G.J. Baumgartner W. Gruber H.J. Schindler H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2926-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). For the identification of a colocalization of proteins with distances of less then 20 nm, fluorescence resonance energy transfer spectroscopy has proven to be a useful tool (29Jares-Erijman E.A. Jovin T.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 1387-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar). However, these techniques do not provide topographical information of protein clusters or so-called rafts. With electron microscopy, images of fixed samples in vacuum can be obtained with high resolution. The sizes of lipid rafts, which are being discussed as hosting signaling proteins, have been determined with optical tweezers (30Pralle A. Keller P. Florin E.L. Simons K. Hörber J.K.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 997-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). High resolution under physiological conditions can be obtained with atomic force microscopy. Furthermore, a functionalization of the cantilever tip with particular chemical groups or proteins (e.g. antibodies) can be used to specifically localize proteins (19Stroh C. Wang H. Bash R. Ashcroft B. Nelson J. Gruber H. Lohr D. Lindsay S.M. Hinterdorfer P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12503-12507Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 31Grandbois M. Dettmann W. Benoit M. Gaub H.E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 719-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). With the aim of characterizing the role of LBP in the LPS-induced activation of MNCs, we performed imaging and force spectroscopy, applying AFM to solid supported reconstituted lipid bilayers resembling the membrane of MNCs. The interactions between LPS, LBP, sCD14, mCD14, and host cells have been investigated intensively in the last years in in vitro and also in in vivo experiments. In this study, we correlated already published biological data with data obtained with reconstituted membrane systems. Due to the reduction of complexity of the biological system, reconstitution systems allow the determination of the underlying mechanisms on a molecular level. Our results and the proposed model allow us to understand the observations from biological experiments described earlier. In earlier investigations into the influence of LBP on the LPS-mediated activation, a dual role of LBP has been proposed; at low concentrations, LBP enhances the activation of MNCs, whereas at high concentrations, it causes a decrease (12Lamping N. Dettmer R. Schroeder N.W.J. Pfeil D. Hallatschek W. Burger R. Schumann R.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2065-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). We could show that the enhanced activation is mediated by LBP molecules intercalated in the cytoplasmic membrane of the MNCs and that the neutralization of LPS is mediated by soluble LBP in the serum (10Gutsmann T. Muller M. Carroll S.F. MacKenzie R.C. Wiese A. Seydel U. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 6942-6950Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In the following, we will discuss three interactions: (i) between soluble LBP and phospholipids as a prerequisite for the activation of MNCs, (ii) between soluble LBP and lipid A as the interaction leading to a neutralization of endotoxin, and (iii) between LBP intercalated in phospholipid membranes and lipid A as the first step in the activation of MNCs. Interaction between Soluble LBP and Phospholipid Membranes—In earlier studies, it has been shown that LBP interacts with phospholipids and that it intercalates into phospholipid bilayer membranes (6Schromm A.B. Brandenburg K. Rietschel E.T. Flad H.-D. Carroll S.F. Seydel U. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) in a transmembraneous orientation (11Gutsmann T. Haberer N. Seydel U. Wiese A. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, nothing was known so far about the lateral organization and orientation of LBP in membranes. In general, two preparation methods can be used to determine the interaction between proteins and lipid matrices: (i) first the lipid liposomes and the proteins are preincubated and are then adsorbed on the mica surface, or (ii) first the lipid liposomes are adsorbed on mica, and the protein is subsequently added to the preformed planar lipid bilayer. Both procedures do not necessarily lead to identical results, and, in fact, this was the case for the interaction between LBP and PS liposomes. When the bilayers were adsorbed first, the LBP molecules bound probably as individual molecules to the bilayer surface and did not form larger protein aggregates (Fig. 1C), although the size of the individual dots was larger than that of molecules imaged directly on mica (Fig. 1A). This observation might result from a dimerization of LBP. However, it is more likely that it results from artifacts (e.g. small movements of individual LBP molecules in the bilayer). Fig. 1, A and C, also demonstrate that LBP does not form protein aggregates in solution. The lateral diffusion of lipids and proteins in a solid supported membrane is reduced (32Nollert P. Kiefer H. Jähnig F. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1447-1455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 33Schütz G.J. Schindler H. Schmidt T. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1073-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), and, thus, the best preparation method mimicking the natural system is the one in which the components are preincubated at 37 °C prior to adsorption on mica. Under these conditions, the phospholipids used in this study were in the fluid state. In preparations according to the latter method and containing low amounts of LBP ([LBP]/[PS] = 1:5·106 m/m), no LBP molecules could be detec"
https://openalex.org/W2059907322,"A fundamental question in biology is how different signaling pathways use common signaling proteins to attain different developmental outcomes. The yeast transcription factor Ste12 is required in at least two distinct signaling processes, each regulated by many of the same protein kinases. Whereas Ste12-Ste12 homodimers promote transcription of genes required for mating, Ste12-Tec1 heterodimers activate genes required for invasive growth. We report that Ste12 and Tec1 undergo covalent modification by the ubiquitin-related modifier SUMO. Stimulation by mating pheromone promotes sumoylation of Ste12 and diminishes the sumoylation of Tec1. In the absence of sumoylation Tec1 is more rapidly degraded. We propose that pheromone-regulated sumoylation of Ste12 and Tec1 promotes a developmental switch from the invasive to the mating differentiation program.

The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae can initiate distinct developmental programs depending on the presence or absence of specific external cues. Mating is initiated when a and α haploid cell types secrete and respond to cell type-specific pheromones acting through G protein-coupled receptors; once activated, the a and α cells fuse to form an a/α diploid cell. Invasive or filamentous growth occurs in nutrient-poor conditions and is manifested by altered budding and formation of long branching filaments, as well as increased adherence and invasion of the substratum. Both developmental outcomes require activation of a protein kinase cascade comprised of Ste20, Ste11, Ste7, and Fus3 or Kss1 (1Roberts R.L. Fink G.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2974-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 2Liu H. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar).

Although the mechanisms of MAP kinase and transcription factor activation are well established, less understood is how signaling pathways that share the same components attain different developmental fates (21Elion E.A. Qi M. Chen W. Science. 2005; 307: 687-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Signal identity has been ascribed to differences in signal magnitude, duration, and frequency (22Bhalla U.S. Ram P.T. Iyengar R. Science. 2002; 297: 1018-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), as well as to the scaffolded association of protein kinase components (23Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar). Even where such differences have been documented, the kinase signals must still be interpreted by nuclear transcription factors to initiate expression of a distinct set of genes (9Zeitlinger J. Simon I. Harbison C.T. Hannett N.M. Volkert T.L. Fink G.R. Young R.A. Cell. 2003; 113: 395-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that Ste12 and Tec1 are covalently modified by the small ubiquitin-related protein SUMO (Smt3 in yeast). Although stimulation by mating pheromone promotes sumoylation of Ste12, the same treatment inhibits sumoylation of Tec1 and the protein is instead degraded. These findings suggest that pheromone-regulated sumoylation of transcription factors underlies the developmental switch from the invasive to the mating differentiation program.

The invasive growth and FRE reporter transcription assays were performed in the Σ1278-based invasive strain MLY218a (MATa leu2 ura3, from J.

Unless indicated otherwise, the concentration of α-factor was 3 μm, which is 10-fold above the EC50 for transcriptional induction. To monitor the loss of Tec1 over time, mid-log cell cultures were treated with α-factor for 60 min, followed by cycloheximide addition as described previously (26Hao N. Yildirim N. Wang Y.

Immunoprecipitations, 6.5% gel electrophoresis, and immunoblot analysis were carried out as described previously (26Hao N. Yildirim N. Wang Y. Elston T.C. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol.

Jentsch), Protein A (Sigma), FLAG (Sigma), and ubiquitin (Sigma). A long-standing question in cell regulation is how signaling pathways that share component proteins can attain different developmental fates. To address this question we investigated whether Ste12 or Tec1 is covalently modified by the small ubiquitin-related protein SUMO (Smt3 in yeast) and whether pheromone-regulated modification of these signaling proteins could underlie the switch from the invasive growth to mating differentiation transcription program. We focused initially on sumoylation because it is a reversible modification known to regulate the activity of nuclear transcription factors, co-activators, and co-repressors (27Hochstrasser M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E153-E157Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 28Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 690-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). In addition, mass spectrometry sequencing identified Ste12 as one of several hundred proteins that co-purify with Smt3, making it a likely substrate for sumoylation (29Wohlschlegel J.A. Johnson E.S. Reed S.I. Yates III, J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45662-45668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Ste12, fused to a TAP tag (24Ghaemmaghami S. Huh W.K. Bower K. Howson R.W. Belle A. Dephoure N. O'Shea E.K. Weissman J.S. Nature. 2003; 425: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3008) Google Scholar), was immunopurified, resolved by gel electrophoresis, and detected by immunoblotting. The antibodies strongly recognized the native form of the protein (Fig. 1, A and B), as well as additional species ∼12 and 24 kDa larger than the native protein, a difference corresponding to the molecular mass of one or two copies of mature SUMO, respectively. The presence of multiple high molecular mass species suggested that Ste12 undergoes sumoylation at two or more sites. The larger forms of the protein were more abundant in cells treated with α-factor pheromone, were less abundant in a mutant strain lacking the E3 SUMO ligase SIZ1 (Fig. 1A), and were completely absent in a ubc9-1 mutant strain deficient in SUMO-conjugating enzyme activity (Fig. 1B) (30Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26799-26802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Ste12 also migrated more slowly in the ubc9–1 mutant strain; however, this mobility shift did not appear to be pheromone regulated. Moreover, the shift is too small to arise from addition of ubiquitin or a ubiquitin-like modifier and may instead result from another known modification such as phosphorylation (3Elion E.A. Satterberg B. Kranz J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 495-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 4Dolan J.W. Kirkman C. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To confirm that Ste12 is sumoylated we immunopurified Ste12 tagged with the FLAG epitope. The higher molecular mass form of Ste12 was recognized by SUMO antibodies and was again enriched by pheromone stimulation (Fig. 1C). The increase in sumoylation was proportionately greater than the induction of Ste12 expression that is typically observed in pheromone-treated cells. Moreover, deletion of either FUS3 or KSS1 dampened the effect of pheromone on Ste12 sumoylation, consistent with the partially overlapping function of the two kinases in this pathway (1Roberts R.L. Fink G.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2974-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 16Sabbagh Jr., W. Flatauer L.J. Bardwell A.J. Bardwell L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 683-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 34Gartner A. Nasmyth K. Ammerer G. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1280-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Kss1 and Fus3 phosphorylate many of the same proteins but with distinct substrate specificities, and this presumably accounts for the differences in Ste12 sumoylation in the two mutants (35Breitkreutz A. Boucher L. Tyers M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1266-1271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We conclude from these data that Ste12 is sumoylated and that sumoylation is enhanced in response to pheromone stimulation. Ste12 binds to PREs present within the promoters of several genes involved in mating. The promoter of the FUS1 gene contains multiple PREs and has been widely used to monitor pheromone-stimulated transcription activity (25Hoffman G. Garrison T.R. Dohlman H.G. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 344: 617-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, a reporter consisting of the PRE promoter fused to lacZ (β-galactosidase) was used to determine how sumoylation affects Ste12 function. Initially we attempted to block sumoylation in Ste12 by substituting Arg for Lys-174 and Lys-409, the two residues that most closely match the preferred sequence for sumoylation (Ψ-K-X-D/E, where Ψ is a hydrophobic residue and X is any residue) (36Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). However, neither mutation, tested alone or in combination, blocked the pheromone-stimulated mobility shift, suggesting that one or more of the other 42 Lys residues in Ste12 is modified (data not shown). We also investigated how the pheromone response is altered in the ubc9 mutant strain. In this mutant PRE-lacZ induction was substantially reduced relative to the wild-type, suggesting that sumoylation is required for full Ste12 activity (data not shown). However, even though the PRE reporter is highly specific for Ste12 activity, the ubc9 mutant could have multiple effects that indirectly affect reporter transcription activity. As an alternative approach we examined PRE-lacZ activity in cells expressing a SUMO-Ste12 fusion protein. Similar SUMO substrate fusions have been used previously to show that sumoylation can diminish transcription factor function (37Ross S. Best J.L. Zon L.I. Gill G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 831-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 38Yang S.H. Jaffray E. Hay R.T. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 63-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 39Long J. Wang G. He D. Liu F. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the absence of pheromone, cells expressing SUMO-Ste12 exhibited no change in basal lacZ activity, suggesting that sumoylation of Ste12 is not sufficient to initiate new gene transcription. In the presence of pheromone, however, cells expressing SUMO-Ste12 exhibited a >2-fold increase in maximum transcription activity (Fig. 1D). The SUMO-Ste12 fusion also increased the pheromone-mediated growth arrest response, as indicated by a larger zone of growth inhibition surrounding a source of α-factor (the response was also more transient, as indicated by resumption of colony growth and the formation of a turbid halo) (Fig. 1E). Finally, activation of the mating response by Ste12-SUMO resulted in a concomitant decrease in the invasive growth response (Fig. 1E). Expression levels of the SUMO-Ste12 fusion were not elevated compared with Ste12 (Fig. 1F). However, whereas native Ste12 is only partially sumoylated after pheromone stimulation, the SUMO-Ste12 fusion resembles a protein that is fully sumoylated all the time, and this presumably accounts for the higher transcription and growth arrest response compared with the native partially sumoylated protein. Thus, sumoylation of Ste12 appears to confer a gain-of-function phenotype, but transcription activity is still contingent on stimulation by upstream components in the pathway. We then considered whether Tec1 is also regulated by sumoylation. As before, a FLAG-Tec1 fusion was immunopurified and probed by immunoblotting with antibodies to FLAG as well as SUMO. Once again we could detect multiple bands with the FLAG antibody, one corresponding to native Tec1 and a second corresponding to Tec1 potentially modified by sumoylation. The higher molecular mass species was also detected using anti-SUMO-antibodies, and both bands were absent in cells containing only the parent vector (Fig. 2A). Pheromone treatment resulted in diminished expression and substantially diminished sumoylation of Tec1 (Fig. 2B). The pheromone-dependent decrease in Tec1 sumoylation is in marked contrast to the pheromone-dependent increase observed for Ste12. Because increased sumoylation promotes Ste12 activity we anticipated that decreased sumoylation might result in diminished Tec1 activity. To test this model we replaced a consensus site Lys at position 54 and found that it successfully eliminated detectable sumoylation concomitant with higher overall expression levels (Fig. 2B). We then measured invasive growth and transcription induction using a FRE promoter fused to lacZ. Rather than decrease activity, the sumoylation-deficient Tec1K54R mutant exhibited slightly elevated FRE-lacZ and invasive growth activities (Fig. 2, C and D) (8Roberts C.J. Nelson B. Marton M.J. Stoughton R. Meyer M.R. Bennett H.A. He Y.D. Dai H. Walker W.L. Hughes T.R. Tyers M. Boone C. Friend S.H. Science. 2000; 287: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 40Oehlen L.J.

Together these data reveal that sumoylation is not required for full Tec1 transcription activity or proper regulation of invasive growth behavior. The higher abundance of Tec1K54R could result from a loss of ubiquitination. Ubiquitin attachment typically leads to rapid capture and degradation of the substrate by the proteasome protease complex (27Hochstrasser M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E153-E157Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), and it was recently documented that Tec1 undergoes phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination and accelerated degradation in pheromone-stimulated cells (42Bao M.Z.

Genet. 2004; 46: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Moreover, modification by SUMO and ubiquitin are often antagonistic and can sometimes occur on the same Lys residue (45Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nature. 2002; 419: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar, 46Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). In agreement with this model, the unsumoylated Tec1K54R mutant was ubiquitinated at a reduced level relative to the wild-type protein (data not shown); the residual ubiquitination was most likely due to modification of an alternate site when the primary site (Lys-54 in this case) becomes unavailable. Moreover, Tec1K54R accumulates a prominent species with reduced mobility but that is not recognized by the anti-SUMO antibodies (Fig. 2B); we presume that this band is due to an accumulation of phosphorylated but poorly ubiquitinated protein. Tec1 ubiquitination is regulated by the MAP kinases Fus3 and Kss1 (42Bao M.Z. Schwartz M.A. Cantin G.T. Yates III, J.R. Madhani H.D. Cell. 2004; 119: 991-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 43Chou S. Huang L. Liu H.

Genet. 2004; 46: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These MAP kinases phosphorylate many common substrates and have partially overlapping function in vivo. Expression of either kinase is sufficient to partially sustain the mating response (Fig. 1C) (1Roberts R.L. Fink G.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2974-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 16Sabbagh Jr., W. Flatauer L.J. Bardwell A.J. Bardwell L. Mol.

Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1280-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). However, significant differences have been reported for the invasive pathway. Deletion of KSS1 is sufficient to block invasive growth, whereas deletion of FUS3 promotes invasive behavior. Moreover, deletion of FUS3 (but not KSS1) results in an increase in FRE binding activity (9Zeitlinger J. Simon I. Harbison C.T. Hannett N.M. Volkert T.L. Fink G.R. Young R.A. Cell. 2003; 113: 395-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and transcription of FRE-containing genes (8Roberts C.J. Nelson B. Marton M.J. Stoughton R. Meyer M.R. Bennett H.A. He Y.D. Dai H. Walker W.L. Hughes T.R. Tyers M. Boone C. Friend S.H. Science. 2000; 287: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 10Madhani H.D. Fink G.R.

Cell. 2001; 8: 683-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To determine whether sumoylation might underlie these differences we compared Tec1 expression in fus3Δ and kss1Δ mutant strains. Deletion of FUS3 (but not KSS1) resulted in elevated expression of Tec1 and also of the sumoylated form of Tec1 (Fig. 3A). Moreover, pheromone treatment of the fus3Δ mutant strain no longer diminished, and even increased slightly, the expression of Tec1. These differences in expression could be ascribed to differences in protein stability because Tec1 was degraded more slowly in the absence of FUS3 expression (Fig. 3B) (42Bao M.Z. Schwartz M.A. Cantin G.T. Yates III, J.R. Madhani H.D. Cell. 2004; 119: 991-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 43Chou S. Huang L. Liu H.

Genet. 2004; 46: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, the negative regulation of Tec1 abundance by Fus3 (but not Kss1) is fully concordant with the previously reported role of Fus3 (but not Kss1) in FRE transcription and invasive growth behavior. Stated differently, there is a strong correlation between Tec1 sumoylation, stability, expression, and transcription activity. Finally, the relationship between Tec1 sumoylation and abundance suggests that sumoylation might stabilize the protein. A prediction of this model is that sumoylated Tec1 should degrade more slowly than the unmodified protein. To test this, we compared the abundance of sumoylated and non-sumoylated Tec1 over time, following cycloheximide treatment to block new protein synthesis. As predicted, the sumoylated form of the protein persisted much longer than the unmodified species, whether expressed under the control of the native promoter (Fig. 3C) or a heterologous inducible promoter (from GAL1, Fig. 3D). Here we have demonstrated that the transcription factors Ste12 and Tec1 are sumoylated. These are the first components of the MAP kinase signaling cascade shown to undergo sumoylation in yeast. More significantly, sumoylation of both proteins is regulated by pheromone. Whereas pheromone promotes sumoylation of Ste12, the same treatment results in diminished sumoylation of Tec1. With respect to Tec1, immunopurification experiments revealed a marked reduction in the proportion of sumoylated protein following treatment with α-factor pheromone (Fig. 2B). Immunoblotting of whole cell extracts also revealed a marked decrease in Tec1 abundance (Fig. 3A) and accelerated Tec1 degradation (Fig. 3B) after pheromone treatment. In contrast, cells lacking Fus3 exhibited no pheromone-dependent change in Tec1 expression, sumoylation (Fig. 3A), or stability (Fig. 3B). These data support a model in which Tec1 is de-sumoylated and consequently degraded in response to MAP kinase signaling. Another function of sumoylation evidently is to regulate Tec1 ubiquitination. Sumoylated Tec1 is more stable than the non-sumoylated protein, and mutating the lysine residue used for sumoylation leads to an increase in Tec1 abundance. The simplest explanation is that the same lysine residue is used for both sumoylation and ubiquitination and that sumoylation enhances protein stability by competing with ubiquitin for a common target site. Tec1K54R is still partially ubiquitinated, however, suggesting that other regulatory mechanisms could exist (data not shown). For instance, sumoylation might prevent recognition of the protein by the proteolytic machinery and thus protect the protein from degradation. We also attempted to block Ste12 sumoylation by mutating the two best candidate sites, alone and in combination. Unfortunately, neither of those mutations blocked Ste12 sumoylation. Besides these two residues, there are another 42 lysines in Ste12 that could potentially serve as sites of sumoylation. Furthermore, it is possible that mutating a preferred site leads to sumoylation at another cryptic site. For these reasons we took an alternative approach and examined the behavior of a SUMO-Ste12 fusion. The gain-of-function phenotype exhibited by the fusion protein, together with the stimulus-dependent nature of Ste12 sumoylation, supports the suggestion that sumoylation promotes Ste12 activity. However, a rigorous test of this aspect of the model will require that the sumoylation sites in Ste12 be definitively mapped and mutated. Tec1 is one of a small but growing list of signaling proteins that undergo ubiquitination (42Bao M.Z. Schwartz M.A. Cantin G.T. Yates III, J.R. Madhani H.D.

Ubiquitination of Ste2, Ste7, and Sst2 are stimulated by pheromone and may therefore contribute to feedback regulation of signaling. In contrast, pheromone-regulated sumoylation of Ste12 and Tec1 is less likely to regulate signal intensity but rather signal specificity by favoring activation of the mating pathway and inactivation of the invasive growth pathway. Given the prevalence of transcription factors that are both sumoylated and ubiquitinated, and of signaling pathways that use shared MAP kinase components, the mechanisms established here are likely to be recapitulated in other signaling systems.

https://openalex.org/W2111514959,"Vein graft failure following bypass surgery is a frequent and important clinical problem. The vascular injury caused by arterialization is responsible for vein graft intimal hyperplasia, a lesion generated by medial smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration into the intima, increased extracellular matrix deposition, and formation of a thick neointima. Development of the neointima into a typical atherosclerotic lesion and consequent stenosis ultimately result in vein graft failure. Endothelial damage, inflammation, and intracellular signaling through mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) have been implicated in the early stages of this process. We therefore investigated the effects of topical inhibition of ERK-1/2 MAPK activation on vascular cell proliferation and apoptosis, and on the inflammatory response in a canine model of vein graft arterialization. For this purpose, vein grafts were incubated with the MEK-1/2 inhibitor, UO126, ex vivo for 30 min before grafting. This treatment effectively abolished arterialization-induced ERK-1/2 activation, decreased medial cell proliferation, and increased apoptosis. UO126 treatment also inhibited the vein graft infiltration by myeloperoxidase-positive inflammatory cells that follows vein graft arterialization. Thus, topical ex vivo administration of MAPK inhibitors can provide a pharmacological tool to prevent or reduce the vascular cell responses that lead to vein graft intimal hyperplasia and graft failure."

However, the mechanisms that govern SNARE complex assembly and disassembly during fusion are not well understood. We have devised a new in vitro cross-linking assay to monitor SNARE complex assembly during fusion of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived vesicles with Golgi-acceptor membranes. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, anterograde ER-Golgi transport requires four SNARE proteins: Sec22p, Bos1p, Bet1p, and Sed5p.

Molecular modeling was used to generate a structure of the four-helix ER-Golgi SNARE complex. Based on this structure, cysteine residues were introduced into adjacent SNARE proteins such that disulfide bonds would form if assembled into a SNARE complex. Our initial studies focused on disulfide bond formation between the SNARE motifs of Bet1p and Sec22p. Expression of SNARE cysteine derivatives in the same strain produced a cross-linked heterodimer of Bet1p and Sec22p under oxidizing conditions. Moreover, this Bet1p-Sec22p heterodimer formed during in vitro transport reactions when ER-derived vesicles containing the Bet1p derivative fused with Golgi membranes containing the Sec22p derivative. Using this disulfide cross-linking assay, we show that inhibition of transport with anti-Sly1p antibodies blocked formation of the Bet1p-Sec22p heterodimer. In contrast, chelation of divalent cations did not inhibit formation of the Bet1p-Sec22p heterodimer during in vitro transport but potently inhibited Golgi-specific carbohydrate modification of glyco-pro-α factor.

These intracellular fusion events are mediated by a family of proteins termed soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptors (SNAREs) 2The abbreviations used are: SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor; Cu2+/Phen, Cu(1,10-phenanthroline)2SO4; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; gpαf, glyco-pro-alpha-factor; MODIP, modeling of disulfide bridges in proteins; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; LMA1, low molecular weight activity 1. 2The abbreviations used are: SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor; Cu2+/Phen, Cu(1,10-phenanthroline)2SO4; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; gpαf, glyco-pro-alpha-factor; MODIP, modeling of disulfide bridges in proteins; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; LMA1, low molecular weight activity 1.

SNAREs are membrane-associated proteins that contain a characteristic heptad repeat region called the SNARE motif. SNARE motifs are ∼60 amino acids in length and participate in forming oligomeric complexes with other SNAREs (2Weimbs T. Low S.H. Chapin S.J. Mostov K.E. Bucher P. Hofmann K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Structural information from neuronal and endosomal SNARE core complexes indicate that the SNARE motifs assemble into parallel, coiled-coil four-helix bundles (3Antonin W. Fasshauer D. Becker S. Jahn R. Schneider T.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 4Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar). During intracellular fusion, SNAREs from one membrane compartment interact with cognate SNAREs on another membrane compartment. The assembly of trans-SNARE complexes from two opposing membranes is thought to provide the driving force for bilayer fusion (5Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E.

Indeed, purified SNARE proteins reconstituted into liposomes are sufficient for fusion events between proteoliposomes when physiologically relevant SNARE combinations are used (7McNew J.A. Parlati F.

Despite the importance of SNAREs for membrane fusion, the precise mechanism by which SNARE proteins catalyze bilayer fusion or how SNARE complex assembly is regulated remains unclear. Current models describe pathways where trans-SNARE protein pairs produce membrane stalk structures that then lead to hemifusion and fusion pore intermediates (10Jahn R. Lang T. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 519-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar, 11Tamm L.K. Crane J. Kiessling V. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Further speculation centers on the nature of the fusion pore and if it is a lipid intermediate or if the transmembrane segments of SNAREs or other proteins form a pore structure (13Han X. Wang C.T. Bai J. Chapman E.R. Jackson M.B. Science. 2004; 304: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 14Reese C. Heise F. Mayer A.

Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Upstream factors, such as Rab GTPases, tethering complexes, and SM proteins, are also required for membrane targeting and SNARE-dependent fusion (16Jahn R. Neuron. 2000; 27: 201-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 17Gillingham A.K. Munro S. Biochim. Biophys.

How these upstream components regulate SNARE complex assembly and disassembly are not known. To explore these questions, we have taken a cysteine-disulfide cross-linking approach to monitor SNARE protein contacts during a round of membrane fusion in a model fusion assay. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, fusion of ER-derived transport vesicles with Golgi-acceptor membranes has been recapitulated in vitro with washed membranes and purified cytosolic factors (19Barlowe C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1097-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 20Baker D. Hicke L. Rexach M. Schleyer M. Schekman R. Cell. 1988; 54: 335-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical studies indicate that the SNAREs Sec22p, Bet1p, Sed5p, and Bos1p are required for anterograde trafficking between the ER and Golgi compartments (21Hardwick K.G. Pelham H.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 22Kaiser C.A. Schekman R. Cell. 1990; 61: 723-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 23Newman A.P. Shim J. Ferro-Novick S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3405-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These four proteins, when mixed together, form a stable quaternary complex with their SNARE motifs predicted to be structurally arranged as observed in the neuronal and endosomal SNARE four-helix bundles (24Parlati F. McNew J.A. Fukuda R. Miller R. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Nature. 2000; 407: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 25Tsui M.M. Tai W.C. Banfield D.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 521-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Previously, disulfide cross-linking has been used to map the spatial and dynamic arrangements of oligomeric membrane receptors such as the aspartate receptor (26Falke J.J. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1987; 237: 1596-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and the dopamine D2 receptor (27Guo W. Shi L. Javitch J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4385-4388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In this study, we engineered unique cysteine residues into the SNARE motifs of Bet1p and Sec22p such that a disulfide-cross-linked heterodimer formed under appropriate conditions. This Bet1p-Sec22p heterodimer was present not only in membrane preparations expressing both SNARE cysteine derivatives, but more importantly, this cross-linked heterodimeric SNARE species was generated in vitro through the fusion of topologically distinct membrane compartments. By combining an established cell-free ER-Golgi transport assay with the disulfide cross-linking approach, we report on the kinetics and requirements for the assembly of nascent Bet1p-Sec22p heterodimers. Plasmids and Plasmid Construction—To generate plasmid pRS315-BET1, the BET1 coding sequence with ∼300 bp of flanking upstream and downstream sequence was amplified from genomic DNA using primers containing XbaI and XhoI restriction sites, respectively. The PCR product was ligated into XbaI- and XhoI-digested pRS315 (28Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid containing the SEC22 gene (pRS313-SEC22) has been described (29Liu Y. Flanagan J.J. Barlowe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27225-27232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cysteine residues were introduced into the SNARE motifs of Sec22p and Bet1p by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The sequences of oligonucleotide primers used in the construction of these cysteine-containing derivatives are available upon request. All of the constructs were sequence verified by automated fluorescent sequencing (Dartmouth Molecular Biology Core Facility). Yeast Strains and Media—Yeast strains CBY740 (Matα his3 leu2 ura3 lys2), CBY773 (Matα his3 leu2 ura3 lys2 sec22Δ::KAN), and CBY1599 (Matα/a his3/his3 leu2/leu2 ura3/ura3 lys2/LYS2 MET15/met15 BET1/bet1Δ::KAN) were purchased from Invitrogen. CBY1584 was generated from transforming CBY773 with pRS313-SEC22-(D153C). CBY1676 was generated from transformation of the heterozygous diploid strain CBY1599 with pRS315-BET1(I83C), followed by sporulation, asci dissection, and scoring to obtain bet1Δ covered by the BET1(I83C) plasmid. For double mutant strains used in Figs. 2 and 3, CBY773 was transformed with plasmids containing the SNARE cysteine derivatives of SEC22 and BET1. Yeast transformations were performed using the lithium acetate method (30Elble R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar). For the preparation of semi-intact cells or microsomal membranes, strains were grown in selective medium (0.67% nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% dextrose, and required supplements) and then back diluted and grown in rich medium (1% Bacto-yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, and 2% dextrose) for several doublings until the A600 was between 0.6 and 0.8. Standard yeast protocols were used (31Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar).FIGURE 3Bet1p(I83C)-Sec22p(D153C) heterodimer formation is dependent on pairs of cysteine residues. Washed semi-intact cells expressing the indicated cysteine mutants of Bet1p and Sec22p were incubated with (+) or without (-) 0.2 mm Cu2+/Phen and processed as described in the legend to Fig. 2. The position of the Bet1p-Sec22p heterodimer is indicated by the solid arrowhead, whereas the asterisk indicates a breakdown product of a Sec22p homodimer. In semi-intact cells expressing both Sec22p- and Bet1p-cysteine derivatives, wild-type Bet1p is also present.

Belden W.J. Heidtman M. Liu J. Jensen O.N. Barlowe C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 503-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and α1,6-mannose linkages (19Barlowe C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1097-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) have been described previously. Polyclonal anti-Sly1p antibodies were raised against a maltose-binding protein-Sly1p (full-length) fusion protein (MBP-Sly1p) expressed from pMAL-c2x (New England Biolabs). Polyclonal anti-Sly1p antibodies were affinity purified by MBP-Sly1p to an Affi-Gel 15 column according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). Preimmune IgGs were isolated by binding to protein A-Sepharose beads as previously detailed (35Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 312-319Google Scholar). Western blots were developed using the SuperSignal WestPico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce Chemical) and developed on both film and with a UVP Bioimaging System. Homology Modeling of Yeast ER-Golgi SNARE Four-helix Bundle— The structure of the yeast ER-Golgi SNARE complex was constructed by homology modeling using the program SWISS-PDB Viewer version 3.7 (36Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9397) Google Scholar, 37Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar). The template used for modeling was the mammalian endosomal SNARE complex (Protein Data Bank accession number 1GL2) (3Antonin W. Fasshauer D. Becker S. Jahn R. Schneider T.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The template and target sequences were aligned based on a previous alignment strategy of the core SNARE motifs (38Fasshauer D. Sutton R.B. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15781-15786Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Briefly, the SNARE motifs of Sec22p, Sed5p, Bos1p, and Bet1p were aligned with and manually threaded onto the SNARE motifs of endobrevin, syntaxin 7, vti1b, and syntaxin 8, respectively. The initial model was further refined using the energy minimization tools provided with the SWISS-PDB program. The quality of the model was evaluated further by using the WHAT_ CHECK verification routines (39Hooft R.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1787) Google Scholar) from the program WHAT_IF (40Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3343) Google Scholar). Following model refinement and verification, the program MODIP (41Dani V.S. Ramakrishnan C. Varadarajan R. Protein Eng. 2003; 16: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 42Sowdhamini R. Srinivasan N. Shoichet B. Santi D.V. Ramakrishnan C. Balaram P. Protein Eng. 1989; 3: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) was used to identify potential sites for introduction of disulfide bonds between adjacent SNARE motifs of the yeast ER-Golgi SNARE complex. In Vitro Budding and Transport Assays—Semi-intact cells from wild-type and SNARE mutant strains were prepared as previously described (20Baker D. Hicke L. Rexach M. Schleyer M. Schekman R. Cell. 1988; 54: 335-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Microsomes were isolated from CBY1676 (43Wuestehube L.J. Schekman R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 124-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and used to generate ER-derived vesicles containing Bet1p(I83C). Vesicle budding and transport assays following [35S]glyco-pro-α-factor (gpαf) have been previously described (19Barlowe C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1097-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 33Cao X. Barlowe C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Briefly, two-stage transport reactions were performed in which COPII-generated vesicles isolated from CBY1676 microsomes were incubated with CBY1584 semi-intact cells (i.e. acceptor membranes) in the presence (or absence) of fusion factors (Uso1p, LMA1) for the indicated times and temperatures. For experiments examining both the transport of gpαf and the extent of formation of a Bet1p-Sec22p heterodimeric species, three parallel transport reactions (30 μl) were set-up in which two of the reactions were processed and averaged for α-1,6-mannose modification (19Barlowe C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1097-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), whereas the third reaction underwent oxidative cross-linking as described below to catalyze disulfide bond formation between adjacent Bet1p and Sec22p proteins. When plotting the percentage of [35S]gpαf transport and amount of heterodimer formation within the same graph, the data were scaled to maximal transport and maximal heterodimer levels, respectively. Oxidative Cross-linking of Cysteine-containing SNAREs—Disulfide cross-linking between adjacent cysteine residues was induced by the addition of Cu(1,10-phenanthroline)2SO4 (Cu2+/Phen) (26Falke J.J. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1987; 237: 1596-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 44Kobashi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 158: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). For initial cross-linking experiments (Figs. 2 and 3), an equivalent amount of membranes from the indicated strains were washed three times with buffer 88 (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mm potassium acetate, 250 mm sorbitol, and 5 mm magnesium acetate) to remove cytosol. Each wash was followed by a brief centrifugation at 20,000 × g to pellet washed semi-intact cells. After the last wash, the semi-intact cells were resuspended in buffer 88, and a freshly prepared Cu2+/Phen solution was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm. The stock Cu2+/Phen solution was made by adding equal volumes of freshly prepared 50 mm CuS04 (dissolved in buffer 88) and 200 mm 1,10-phenanthroline (dissolved in ethanol) into buffer 88. The reactions were incubated on ice for 15 min. Following oxidative cross-linking, the reactions were mixed with a one-half volume of 5× SDS-PAGE non-reducing sample buffer that contained 150 mm N-ethylmaleimide to quench free sulfhydryls. The reactions were then heated at 70 °C for 5 min, followed by a brief 20,000 × g centrifugation to pellet insoluble material. After centrifugation, a portion of the sample was removed and resolved by non-reducing SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose, and probed with the indicated antibodies. For cross-linking of two-stage transport reactions, at the indicated times, the reactions were placed on ice for 2 min, followed by the addition of Cu2+/Phen to a final concentration of 0.2 mm. The reactions were incubated on ice for 15 min and then mixed with an equal volume of quenching solution (buffer 88 containing 100 mm N-ethylmaleimide) for an additional 15 min. The reactions were then centrifuged at ∼148,000 × g in a TLA 100.3 rotor (Beckman Coulter) for 10 min at 4 °C to concentrate membranes. After centrifugation, the resulting membrane pellets were solubilized in 15 μl of 2× non-reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were heated at 70 °C for 5 min and then centrifuged briefly at 20,000 × g. The samples were resolved by nonreducing SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose, and probed with the indicated antibodies. For densitometric analysis, bands on immunoblots were quantified using the Labworks software package (UVP). Rationale—Transport between the ER and Golgi involves a number of distinct steps that include tethering and fusion of vesicles to Golgi-acceptor membranes. During vesicle fusion, SNARE complex assembly between donor and acceptor membranes is an essential feature of this intracellular transport event. ER-Golgi transport assays in yeast have primarily used [35S]gpαf glycosylation to monitor the fusion stage and to investigate mechanisms involved in this process. However, [35S]gpαf transport assays report indirectly on membrane fusion events because outer chain glycosylation relies on lumenal content mixing between vesicles loaded with [35S]gpαf and Golgi membranes containing α1,6-mannosyltransferase activity. To further dissect subreactions involved in vesicle fusion, we developed a novel in vitro cross-linking assay to measure SNARE-SNARE interactions that occur between COPII-generated vesicles and Golgi-acceptor membranes. In this assay, single cysteine residues within the SNARE motifs of two ER-Golgi SNARE proteins were positioned such that when assembled into a SNARE complex, oxidizing conditions would produce a disulfide-cross-linked species that could be resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblot. To ensure that the cross-linked heterodimeric SNAREs arise from different membrane compartments, isolated ER-derived vesicles expressing one of the unique cysteine-containing SNAREs were combined with Golgi-acceptor membranes expressing the cognate cysteine-containing SNARE. The presence and detection of a heterodimeric SNARE species allows us to investigate SNARE interactions and complex assembly both pre- and post-fusion. This new cross-linking approach should provide additional insights into membrane targeting and fusion mechanisms by monitoring a subreaction within the vesicle fusion stage. Homology Modeling and Prediction of Disulfide Pairs in Yeast ER-Golgi SNARE Complex—Based on the crystal structure of the endosomal SNARE complex (3Antonin W. Fasshauer D. Becker S. Jahn R. Schneider T.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), we generated a homology model of the yeast ER-Golgi SNARE complex by first aligning SNARE motifs of the ER-Golgi SNAREs with SNARE motifs of their endosomal counterparts (Fig. 1A) (38Fasshauer D. Sutton R.B. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15781-15786Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 45Bock J.B. Matern H.T. Peden A.A. Scheller R.H. Nature. 2001; 409: 839-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). As is characteristic of coiled-coil domains, the sequences of the ER-Golgi SNAREs contained the hallmark heptad repeat unit in which hydrophobic amino acids are found at intervals of four and three amino acids. After the sequence alignments were completed, the ER-Golgi SNARE sequences were mapped onto the modeling template to generate a preliminary structure that required additional refinement using energy minimization tools provided by the SWISS-PDB software program. The yeast ER-Golgi SNARE complex model (Fig. 1B) closely resembled the structures of both the endosomal template and the crystal structure of the neuronal SNARE complex (3Antonin W. Fasshauer D. Becker S. Jahn R. Schneider T.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 4Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar). As in the latter structures, the ER-Golgi SNARE complex model consisted of a parallel four-helix coiled-coil bundle in which the hydrophobic layers and the central ionic layer contribute to core interactions between different SNARE helices. Once the ER-Golgi SNARE complex model was generated, the disulfide bond prediction program MODIP was used to identify pairs of residues that were capable of disulfide bond formation if mutated to cysteines. From this ER-Golgi SNARE complex model, 21 potential disulfide bond pairs were identified by the MODIP algorithm, and then subsequently verified for disulfide bond formation in silico by converting potential residues to cysteines in the computer-generated structure. All predicted pairs of residues occur between SNAREs that are adjacent to each other in the ER-Golgi SNARE complex model, whereas no pairs were predicted involving residues from opposing SNARE helices (i.e. no Sec22p-Bos1p or Sed5p-Bet1p). To capture disulfide-linked SNARE species from bona fide fusion events, one cysteine-containing SNARE from ER-derived vesicles must interact with a cysteine-containing SNARE located on Golgi-acceptor membranes. Ideally, the two cysteine-containing SNARE derivatives would originate on the membrane compartment in which they are functionally required during transport. In previous studies using thermosensitive alleles of SNAREs, we determined that both Bet1p and Bos1p were functionally required on ER-derived vesicles (33Cao X. Barlowe C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), whereas Sec22p was functionally required on both vesicles and Golgi membranes during transport (32Liu Y. Barlowe C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3314-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Given the specific compartmental requirements for ER-Golgi SNARE functionality, we focused our attention on three predicted disulfide pairs involving Bet1p-Sec22p (Fig. 1B). Disulfide Cross-linking of Bet1p and Sec22p Expressed within the Same Yeast Strain—We performed initial experiments to validate our experimental design and determine which predicted SNARE pairs, if any, could generate a disulfide-cross-linked species. Yeast strains were constructed in which cysteine residues were introduced near the -3, -1, and +3 hydrophobic layers in the SNARE motifs of Sec22p and Bet1p (Fig. 1). These cysteine-containing SNARE derivatives were expressed under their endogenous promoters from CEN-based plasmids, and semi-intact cell membranes were prepared from strains co-expressing both cysteine-containing SNAREs. After incubation of membranes with Cu2+/Phen to promote an oxidizing environment, cross-linking reactions were quenched with N-ethylmaleimide, and proteins were resolved by non-reducing SDS-PAGE. Disulfide cross-linked proteins were detected by immunoblotting to identify species recognized by both anti-Bet1p and anti-Sec22p antibodies and having an electrophoretic mobility near the theoretical size of a Bet1p-Sec22p heterodimer (∼41 kDa). For the initial evaluation of Bet1p-Sec22p pairs (Fig. 2), cysteine-containing SNARE derivatives were expressed from CEN-based plasmids in a sec22Δ strain (CBY773). Therefore, in these membranes, a single copy of SEC22 was provided by the plasmid, whereas two copies of BET1 (endogenous and cysteine-containing) were expressed. Because the primary objective at this stage was to test which pairs of SNARE proteins were capable of forming disulfide-cross-linked products, the presence of endogenous wild-type Bet1p should not prevent the identification of such pairs. Three of the predicted Bet1p-Sec22p pairs were tested and two of the pairs formed disulfide-cross-linked species (Fig. 2, solid arrowhead) t"

https://openalex.org/W2027195522,"We have combined nucleoside analog interference with chemical footprinting, thermal denaturation, NMR spectroscopy, and biochemical studies to understand recognition of the polypurine tract (PPT) primer of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae long terminal repeat-containing retrotransposon Ty3 by its cognate reverse transcriptase. Locked nucleic acid analogs, which constrain sugar ring geometry, were introduced pairwise throughout the PPT (-)-DNA template, whereas abasic tetrahydrofuran linkages, which lack the nucleobase but preserve the sugar phosphate backbone, were introduced throughout the (-)-strand DNA template and (+)-strand RNA primer. Collectively, our data suggest that both the 5′- and 3′-portions of the PPT-containing RNA/DNA hybrid are sensitive to nucleoside analog substitution, whereas the intervening region can be modified without altering cleavage specificity. These two regions most likely correspond to portions of the PPT that make close contact with the Ty3 reverse transcriptase thumb subdomain and RNase H catalytic center, respectively. Achieving a similar phenotype with nucleoside analogs that have different effects on duplex geometry reveals structural features that are important mediators of Ty3 PPT recognition. Finally, the results from introducing tetrahydrofuran lesions around the scissile PPT/unique 3′-sequence junction indicate that template nucleobase -1 is dispensable for catalysis, whereas a primer nucleobase on either side of the junction is necessary. We have combined nucleoside analog interference with chemical footprinting, thermal denaturation, NMR spectroscopy, and biochemical studies to understand recognition of the polypurine tract (PPT) primer of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae long terminal repeat-containing retrotransposon Ty3 by its cognate reverse transcriptase. Locked nucleic acid analogs, which constrain sugar ring geometry, were introduced pairwise throughout the PPT (-)-DNA template, whereas abasic tetrahydrofuran linkages, which lack the nucleobase but preserve the sugar phosphate backbone, were introduced throughout the (-)-strand DNA template and (+)-strand RNA primer. Collectively, our data suggest that both the 5′- and 3′-portions of the PPT-containing RNA/DNA hybrid are sensitive to nucleoside analog substitution, whereas the intervening region can be modified without altering cleavage specificity. These two regions most likely correspond to portions of the PPT that make close contact with the Ty3 reverse transcriptase thumb subdomain and RNase H catalytic center, respectively. Achieving a similar phenotype with nucleoside analogs that have different effects on duplex geometry reveals structural features that are important mediators of Ty3 PPT recognition. Finally, the results from introducing tetrahydrofuran lesions around the scissile PPT/unique 3′-sequence junction indicate that template nucleobase -1 is dispensable for catalysis, whereas a primer nucleobase on either side of the junction is necessary. Although reverse transcription in long terminal repeat (LTR) 3The abbreviations used are: LTR, long terminal repeat; PPT, polypurine tract; RTs, reverse transcriptases; U3, unique 3′-sequence; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; LNA, locked nucleic acid; H4folate, tetrahydrofuran; RAb, abasic riboside; DAb, abasic deoxyriboside; Tm, melting temperature; DQF, double quantum filtered. -containing retrotransposons of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Ty1 and Ty3) and Saccharomyces paradoxus (Ty5) can be likened to that in retroviruses, notable differences have recently been documented. These include (a) initiation of (-)-strand DNA synthesis from an internal site of the host-coded tRNA primer as opposed to its 3′ terminus (1Ke N. Gao X. Keeney J.B. Boeke J.D. Voytas D.F. RNA (N.

A detailed biochemical study of these processes has been hampered by the lack of purified LTR-containing retrotransposon reverse transcriptases (RTs).

Such specificity is required to create the (+)-strand primer and later to remove it from nascent (+)-DNA, thereby creating an integration-competent, double-stranded DNA provirus. Surprisingly, although a compilation of PPT sequences (14Rattray A.J. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 445-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 15Rausch J.W. Le Grice S.F.J. Int. J. Biochem.

Despite this, the Ty1 and Ty3 PPTs are accurately cleaved by their cognate RTs (7Rausch J.W. Grice M.K. Henrietta M. Nymark M. Miller J.T. Le Grice S.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275 (S. F.

In the absence of any obvious sequence homology, we have considered the possibility that structural features of the Ty3 PPT upstream of the PPT/U3 junction facilitate enzyme positioning in an orientation placing the RNase H catalytic site over the scissile bond. At the same time, subdomains of the cognate RT would be expected to make specific contacts with both nucleobases and the sugar phosphate backbone. Crystallographic studies with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RT (17Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P.

Targeted nucleobase removal from the PPT (-)-DNA template showed that modifying positions -15, -14, and -13 (defining position -1 as the first base pair 5′ to the PPT/U3 cleavage junction) altered cleavage specificity, suggesting that contacts mediated by the p66 thumb subdomain had been disrupted (13Yi-Brunozzi H.Y. Le Grice S.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20154-20162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Such a correlation indirectly suggests that protein/nucleic acid interactions involving either extremity of the PPT and defined by the spatial separation of the RNase H active site and thumb subdomain could be important modulators of cleavage specificity. The goal of this study was to test this hypothesis with a non-retroviral RT and “non-canonical” PPT. One strategy to investigate nucleic acid geometry is to introduce nucleoside analogs into the duplex in a manner that does not disrupt sequence context, but that imparts increased or decreased flexibility. Using a scanning strategy with locked nucleic acid (LNA) analogs (20Petersen M. Nielsen C.B. Nielsen K.E. Jensen G.A. Bondensgaard K. Singh S.K. Rajwanshi V.K. Koshkin A.A. Dahl B.M. Wengel J.

Dyn. 1999; 17: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 23Ayadi L. Coulombeau C. Lavery R. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 2000; 17: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which introduce rigidity and flexibility, respectively, into nucleic acids, we have defined two regions of the Ty3 PPT important for accurate cleavage of the scissile bond at the PPT/U3 junction. As might be predicted, one of these is the PPT/U3 junction, where LNA insertions and nucleobase removal as far as position -3 are capable of redirecting cleavage from the junction. The second region is the 5′-extremity of the PPT, where nucleoside analog insertion between positions -11 and -8 also induces altered cleavage specificity. However, the intervening region from positions -7 to -4 is more tolerant to analog insertion. Despite differing from HIV-1 in both PPT sequence and quaternary structure of its cognate polymerase, the results presented here with Ty3 RT suggest a common feature inasmuch as protein/nucleic acid interactions involving both extremities of the RNA/DNA hybrid cooperate to position the RNase H active site over the -1/+1 scissile bond. Nucleic Acid Substrates—rSpacer (introducing abasic H4folate RNA lesions) and dSpacer (introducing abasic H4folate DNA lesions) were purchased from Glen Research Corp. (Sterling, VA). Hereafter, these are referred to as RAb and DAb, respectively. LNA phosphoramidites were purchased from Proligo Reagents. Substituted 39-nucleotide DNA and 29-nucleotide RNA oligonucleotides were synthesized at a 1-μmol scale on a PE Biosystems Expedite 8909 nucleic acid synthesizer by standard phosphoramidite chemistry, with the exception that coupling times for LNA-cytidine were extended to 15 min. The fluorescent analog Cy3 was chemically substituted at the 5′-end of the oligonucleotides by a standard chemical synthesis method. Stepwise coupling yields for incorporation of the analogs were >98% as determined by trityl cation monitoring. Nucleic acid sequences and sites of substitution are illustrated in Fig. 2A and are described below. Deprotection and cleavage of the DNA oligonucleotides from the Controlled-Pore Glass support were carried out by incubation in 30% NH4OH for 36 h at 25 °C, whereas that of the RNA oligonucleotides were carried out following the instructions of Proligo Reagents. Oligonucleotides were purified by preparative PAGE and quantified spectrophotometrically (260 nm), assuming a molar extinction coefficient equal to the sum of the constituent deoxy- or ribonucleotides. An unmodified 29-nucleotide RNA containing the Ty3 PPT and flanking sequences at its 5′ and 3′ termini was also synthesized. Hybrids were prepared by heating a 1.5:1 RNA/DNA mixture to 95 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) and 25 mm NaCl for 5 min, followed by slow cooling to 4 °C. Hybridized duplexes were stored at -20 °C. Melting Temperature (Tm) Measurements—For Tm measurements, equimolar concentrations of (+)-strand RNA primer were hybridized to (-)-strand DNA templates by heating to 90 °C and slow cooling in a degassed solution of 10 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 (pH 7.0) and 80 mm NaCl. Annealed substrates were analyzed on a 10% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and visualized by ethidium bromide binding to determine that complete hybridization had been achieved. 10 μg/ml solutions of RNA/DNA hybrids were analyzed in a Beckman DU 640 spectrophotometer. E260 was measured at 0.2 °C intervals from 30 to 80 °C. The Tm of each hybrid was calculated by the “first derivative” method described by the manufacturer. NMR Analysis—20-Nucleotide oligodeoxyribonucleic acids (3′-dTdTdGdGdGAdCdTdCdTdCdTdCdTdCdCdTdTdCdT-5′ (wild type), 3′-dTdTdGdGdGAdCdTdCdTdCdTdCdTdCdCdTLdTLdCdT-5′ (-2/-1LNA), 3′-dTdTdGdGdGdAdCdTdCdTdCdTdCLdTLdCdCdTdTdCdT-5′ (-6/-5LNA), and 3′-dTdTdGdGdAdCdTLdCLdTdCdTdCdTdCdCdTdTdCdT-5′ (-11/-10LNA), where XLL represents the LNA base) were hybridized to oligoribonucleotide 5′-rArArCrCrCrUrGrArGrArGrArGrArGrGrArArGrA-3′ (PPT primer) to prepare a 20-bp RNA/DNA hybrid. Individual RNA and DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified as described above and desalted by dialysis against sterile double distilled H2O, followed by a buffer of 10 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4 (pH 7.0) and 80 mm NaCl. Strand concentrations were determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm using extinction coefficients of 218 mm-1 cm-1 for the RNA strand and 168.2 mm-1 cm-1 for the DNA strand. The RNA/DNA hybrid was formed by mixing the RNA and DNA strands at a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio, heating the mixture to 90 °C, and slow cooling. Double quantum filtered (DQF) COSY experiments were performed using samples of unmodified (1.2 mm) and LNA-substituted (∼0.5 mm) 20-bp PPT-containing RNA/DNA hybrids in 10 mm phosphate (pH 7.0) and 80 mm NaCl dissolved in 90% H2O and 10% D2O at 30 °C. The spectrum of the unmodified Ty3 RNA/DNA hybrid was acquired using a four-channel Varian 800-MHz spectrometer equipped with an actively shielded z-axis gradient triple-resonance probe, and those of the LNA-substituted hybrids were acquired using a three-channel Bruker BioSpin Avance 600-MHz spectrometer equipped with an actively shielded z-axis gradient triple-resonance TXI CryoProbe. All spectra were processed using NMRPipe on a Linux PC workstation. KMnO4 Footprinting—RNA/DNA hybrids containing analogs in the (-)-DNA template were incubated at room temperature for 5 min in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 100 mm MgCl2. The total reaction volume was 20 μl. Modification reactions were initiated by adding 2 μl of freshly prepared 25 mm KMnO4 solution and terminated after 30 s with 2 μl of 14 m β-mercaptoethanol. After ethanol precipitation and desiccation, samples were treated with 100 μl of 1 m piperidine for 30 min at 90 °C. Piperidine was removed by vacuum desiccation. Nucleic acids were washed three times with 50 μl of water and vacuum-dried after each resuspension. Samples were finally resuspended in 89 mm Tris borate (pH 8.3), 2 mm EDTA, and 95% formamide containing 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol and fractionated by electrophoresis on 15% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea. Fluorescence Anisotropy Measurements—Anisotropy measurements were carried out using a HORIBA Jobin Yvon FluoroMax 3 fluorometer equipped with a 75-watt arc lamp and both emission and excitation monochromators. Samples containing 10 nm RNA/DNA hybrids in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) and 80 mm NaCl were pipetted into a 100-μl ultramicro cell, and fluorescence emission was recorded from 550 to 570 nm using an excitation wavelength of 542 nm at 25 °C. Slits widths on both channels were set to 5 nm. All reported values represent the average of measurements obtained from three different samples. The affinity of Ty3 RT for PPT variants was measured by titrating increasing concentrations of enzyme against 10 nm Cy3-labeled PPT substrate. Anisotropy of the substrate was recorded after each enzyme addition. The results of each titration were plotted as a relative change of anisotropy versus enzyme concentration and were fitted to an equation using nonlinear regression as described by Heyduk and Lee (24Heyduk T. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6914-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). RNase H-mediated PPT Selection—Ty3 PPT selection was evaluated as described previously (10Lener D. Kvaratskhelia M. Le Grice S.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26526-26532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). 5′-End labeling of the PPT-containing RNA was performed with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Substrates were generated by annealing radiolabeled RNA to wild-type or substituted (-)-strand DNA. Hydrolysis was initiated by adding Ty3 RT to RNA/DNA hybrids in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 80 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 9 mm MgCl2 at 30 °C, with the enzyme and RNA/DNA hybrid present at final concentrations of 15 and 50 nm, respectively. Reactions were terminated after 10 min by adding an equal volume of formamide-based gel loading buffer (95% (v/v) formamide containing 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol), and the hydrolysis products were fractionated by high voltage electrophoresis on 15% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea. Products were visualized by autoradiography and/or phosphorimaging. DNA-dependent DNA Polymerase Activity—DNA synthesis was measured on 39-nucleotide DNA templates annealed to a 5′-end-labeled 21-nucleotide DNA primer containing the PPT sequence. Polymerization was initiated by adding 10 nm enzyme to a mixture containing 50 nm template-primer, 200 μm dNTPs, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 80 mm NaCl, 6 mm dithiothreitol, and 9 mm MgCl2 at 25 °C and terminated after 10 min by adding an equal volume of gel loading buffer. DNA synthesis products were fractionated by high voltage electrophoresis on 15% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea in Tris borate/EDTA buffer. After drying, gels were subjected to autoradiography and/or phosphorimaging using a Personal Molecular Imager FX system (Bio-Rad). Experimental Strategy—The strategy for our nucleoside analog interference studies with the Ty3 PPT is presented in Fig. 2. Position -1 is defined as the first base pair 5′ to the PPT/U3 junction, and duplex regions are defined as upstream or downstream of this junction (Fig. 2A). Overlapping LNA insertions were introduced pairwise throughout the (-)-DNA template between positions -16 and +6, whereas abasic H4folate linkages were introduced singly into the (-)-DNA template and (+)-RNA primer between positions -12 and +2. Fig. 2B shows the structure of an LNA monomer, which induces a C-3′-endo configuration of the C-4′/C-2′ methylene-linked sugar (20Petersen M. Nielsen C.B. Nielsen K.E. Jensen G.A. Bondensgaard K. Singh S.K. Rajwanshi V.K. Koshkin A.A. Dahl B.M. Wengel J. Jacobsen J.P. J. Mol. Recognit. 2000; 13: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In contrast, H4folate linkages in the DNA or RNA strand (Fig. 2C) remove the nucleobase while preserving the sugar phosphate backbone (25Lhomme J. Constant J.F. Demeunynck M. Biopolymers. 1999; 52: 65-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Prior to evaluating the effect of analog insertion on cleavage specificity, the duplex stability and affinity of Ty3 RT for modified RNA/DNA hybrids were determined to eliminate the possibility that the altered enzyme activity was a consequence of gross conformational changes of the substrate. Thermal Denaturation Profiles—Under our experimental conditions, a Tm of 70 °C was determined for the unsubstituted RNA/DNA hybrid. Nucleobase removal from the RNA primer was more destabilizing, reducing the Tm by between 8 °C (-1RAb) and 10.2 °C (-8RAb). This result likely reflects loss of both intrastrand stacking and interstrand hydrogen bonding. The destabilizing effect was slightly less pronounced for substitutions in the (-)-DNA template, where the Tm was reduced by between 6.0 °C (-12DAb) and 9.1 °C (-6DAb). However, no individual position within the Ty3 PPT appeared particularly sensitive following nucleobase removal from either strand (data not shown). In contrast, an unexpected pattern was obtained for RNA/DNA hybrids containing LNA insertions in the (-)-DNA template (Table 1). Consistent with a previous report (26Bondensgaard K. Petersen M. Singh S.K. Rajwanshi V.K. Kumar R. Wengel J. Jacobsen J.P. Chemistry. 2000; 6: 2687-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), insertions between positions -16 and -12 and between positions -4 and +6 increased the Tm by between 1.0 °C (-14/-13LNA) and 6 °C (-4/-3LNA). In contrast, LNA insertions between positions -12 and -4 uniformly decreased the Tm by between 5 °C (-11/-10LNA) and 7 °C (-5/-4LNA). Resynthesis of representative (-)-DNA templates containing the -7/-6LNA and -6/-5LNA substitutions resulted in a similar reduction in the Tm of the hybrid, excluding the simple possibility of experimental error during oligonucleotide synthesis or annealing (data not shown). The data of Table 1 thus suggest that constraining sugar ring geometry upstream of the Ty3 PPT/U3 junction has a destabilizing effect, possibly through disrupting stacking interactions at a particularly sensitive region of the RNA/DNA hybrid. Interestingly, the complementary sequence between positions -12 and -4 contains three adjacent and overlapping 5′-rArGrA-3′ steps. Kopka et al. (27Kopka M.L. Lavelle L. Han G.W. Ng H.L. Dickerson R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) noted that the ring-over-ring stacking of purines of such a sequence is not observed in an RNA/DNA hybrid modeled after the HIV-1 PPT, suggesting that it may contribute to deformability of this sequence. The presence of multiple steps of 5′-rArGrA-3′ in the Ty3 PPT may therefore render the duplex highly malleable and, by inference, highly susceptible to LNA modification.TABLE 1Tm values for Ty3 PPT-containing duplexes with LNA doublet substitutions in the (–)-DNA template between positions –16 and +6 Boldface values represent LNA insertions that destabilized the RNA/DNA hybrid.

DQF-COSY spectra were acquired for the -2/-1LNA-, -6/-5LNA-, and -11/-10LNA-substituted hybrids and compared with that of the unmodified hybrid. Differences in the chemical shift patterns and line widths observed for H-5/H-6 correlations in the DQF-COSY spectra of the -2/-1LNA-substituted (Fig. 3B), -6/-5LNA-substituted (Fig. 3C), and -11/-10LNA-substituted (Fig. 3D) hybrids provide a direct indicator of changes in base stacking geometry and dynamics in the hybrid. Strikingly, chemical shift perturbations were observed for almost all H-5/H-6 correlations in each of the LNA-substituted hybrids relative to the unmodified PPT, indicating that the LNA doublet insertion results in an altered structure over the entire PPT, with long-range effects observed for residues up to 16 bp distal to the site of the substitution (Fig. 3A), and not simply a local structural perturbation as has been observed in previous studies of LNA-substituted RNA/DNA hybrids (21Petersen M. Bondensgaard K. Wengel J. Jacobsen J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 5974-5982Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 26Bondensgaard K. Petersen M. Singh S.K. Rajwanshi V.K. Kumar R. Wengel J. Jacobsen J.P. Chemistry. 2000; 6: 2687-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The observed chemical shift perturbations for other proton resonances in the LNA-substituted PPTs also indicate that these insertions result in structural alterations over the entire PPT (data not shown). In addition, the structural perturbations appear to propagate more strongly upstream of the position of LNA substitution, with particularly large effects immediately adjacent to the PPT between positions -16 and -13. Significant line broadening was also observed for a number of H-5/H-6 resonances in each spectrum, with the most significant resonance line broadening resulting from the -10/-11LNA doublet substitution. Taken together, the NMR data demonstrate that the insertion of LNA doublets produces a structural perturbation that appears to significantly alter the hybrid conformation both within and immediately upstream of the Ty3 PPT. In this regard, the PPT-containing RNA/DNA hybrid appears unique in that a fixed altered local backbone geometry resulting from the LNA substitutions is propagated as long-range structural perturbations throughout the entire element. It is noteworthy to point out that LNA substitutions in RNA/DNA hybrids are known to alter the secondary structure of the nucleic acid locally, mostly restricted to the flanking 3′- and 5′-bases (28Nielsen K.E. Spielmann H.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 15273-15282Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, there has been no report on the long-range global structural perturbations associated with local LNA substitutions in general RNA/DNA context as observed with Ty3 PPTs. The global nature of the structural effects could possibly explain the unusual observation of decreased Tm values for hybrids with LNA doublet substitutions between positions -12 and -4. However, more detailed structural analysis of the LNA-substituted hybrids will be required before specific structural changes can be correlated with altered thermal stability of the Ty3 PPT. Affinity of Ty3 RT for Modified RNA/DNA Hybrids—To assess whether analog insertion affected the affinity for Ty3 RT for the modified PPT, equilibrium dissociation constants were determined for several substituted hybrids via fluorescence anisotropy (29Vogel S.K. Schulz A. Rippe K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4094-4101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Arosio D. Costantini S. Kong Y. Vindigni A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42826-42835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For substrates containing RAb substitutions, the fluorophore Cy3 was introduced into the (-)-DNA template, whereas for substrates containing DAb and LNA substitutions, the fluorophore was introduced into the (+)-RNA primer. As shown in Fig. 4A, Kd values of 11.13 and 13.24 nm were determined for the unmodified hybrids containing Cy3 on the DNA and RNA strands, respectively. Although the affinity of Ty3 RT for the PPT-containing RNA/DNA hybrid was slightly reduced, these values are consistent with the Kd of ∼3.6 nm previously determined with duplex DNA (31Bibillo A. Lener D. Klarmann G.J. Le Grice S.F.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The dissociation constants for Ty3 RT with PPT variants containing LNA doublet substitutions at positions -2/-1, -6/-5, -11/-10, and -13/-12 were in general agreement with those for the unmodified RNA/DNA hybrids (Fig. 4B), ranging from 13.85 nm (-13/-12LNA) to 19.01 nm (-11/-10LNA). This result indicates that the modifications did not compromise recognition by Ty3 RT. Surprisingly, the affinity of Ty3 RT for substrates lacking template or primer nucleobases -1, -6, -9, and -12 increased ∼5-fold for duplexes substituted in either the RNA and DNA strand. This result might indicate that increased duplex flexibility, resulting from local alterations to base stacking and hydrogen bonding, stabilizes the nucleoprotein complex. Cleavage of LNA-substituted PPT Variants by Ty3 RT—As shown in Fig. 2A, LNA substitutions were introduced pairwise into the (-)-DNA template throughout the PPT. In addition, the adjacent upstream sequences between positions -16 and -13 and downstream sequences between positions +2 and +6 were substituted to determine whether the LNA effect was restricted to the PPT-containing duplex or simply reflected a more general alteration of nucleic acid architecture. The results of this analysis are illustrated in Fig. 5. For the wild-type RNA/DNA hybrid, the major hydrolysis sites were the PPT/U3 junction (defined as position -1) and positions +4 and +6 (Fig. 5, lane W). LNA substitutions between positions -16 and -13 had little effect on cleavage at the PPT/U3 junction (Fig. 5, lanes a-d), although the -14/-13LNA and -13/-12LNA substitutions eliminated cleavage at position +4 (Fig. 5, lanes c and d, respectively). In contrast, reduc"

Characteristics of the apoptosis include rapidity and selectivity for mature cells. Follicular lymphomas are particularly refractory to apoptosis. The B-cell lymphoma Ramos shares characteristics of this subgroup and is insensitive to apoptosis via simple HLA-DR engagement. However, oligomerization of HLA-DR antigens induced caspase activation followed by phosphatidylserine externalization, activation of PKC-delta and cleavage of nuclear lamin B. Mitochondrial injury was also detected. However, inhibition of caspase activation simply delayed the apoptotic phenotype but neither protected against cell death nor prevented mitochondrial injury. The data in this report demonstrate that the requirements for the initiating signal (oligomerization versus engagement) as well as the molecular pathways varies between different B lymphoproliferations despite their common expression of HLA-DR. Finally, blockade of caspase activation in parallel with HLA-DR mAb stimulation could provide a potent autovaccination stimulus by leading to necrotic death of B-cell lymphomas."
