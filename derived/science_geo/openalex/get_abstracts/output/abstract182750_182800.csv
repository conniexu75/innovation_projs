https://openalex.org/W2171668474,"Gamma frequency oscillations (30-100 Hz) have been suggested to underlie various cognitive and motor functions. Here, we examine the generation of gamma oscillation currents in the hippocampus, using two-dimensional, 96-site silicon probes. Two gamma generators were identified, one in the dentate gyrus and another in the CA3-CA1 regions. The coupling strength between the two oscillators varied during both theta and nontheta states. Both pyramidal cells and interneurons were phase-locked to gamma waves. Anatomical connectivity, rather than physical distance, determined the coupling strength of the oscillating neurons. CA3 pyramidal neurons discharged CA3 and CA1 interneurons at latencies indicative of monosynaptic connections. Intrahippocampal gamma oscillation emerges in the CA3 recurrent system, which entrains the CA1 region via its interneurons."
https://openalex.org/W1972334605,"The morphogenesis of dendritic spines, the major sites of excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain, is important in synaptic development and plasticity. We have identified an ephrinB-EphB receptor trans-synaptic signaling pathway which regulates the morphogenesis and maturation of dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons. Activation of the EphB receptor induces translocation of the Rho-GEF kalirin to synapses and activation of Rac1 and its effector PAK. Overexpression of dominant-negative EphB receptor, catalytically inactive kalirin, or dominant-negative Rac1, or inhibition of PAK eliminates ephrin-induced spine development. This novel signal transduction pathway may be critical for the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton controlling spine morphogenesis during development and plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2114773717,"The central serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmitter system is an important modulator of diverse physiological processes and behaviors; however, the transcriptional mechanisms controlling its development are largely unknown. The Pet-1 ETS factor is a precise marker of developing and adult 5-HT neurons and is expressed shortly before 5-HT appears in the hindbrain. Here we show that in mice lacking Pet-1, the majority of 5-HT neurons fail to differentiate. Remaining ones show deficient expression of genes required for 5-HT synthesis, uptake, and storage. Significantly, defective development of the 5-HT system is followed by heightened anxiety-like and aggressive behavior in adults. These findings indicate that Pet-1 is a critical determinant of 5-HT neuron identity and implicate a Pet-1-dependent program in serotonergic modulation of behavior."

https://openalex.org/W1995831678,"Little is known about how GABAergic inputs interact with excitatory inputs under conditions that maintain physiological concentrations of intracellular anions. Using extracellular and gramicidin perforated-patch recording, we show that somatic and dendritic GABA responses in mature cortical pyramidal neurons are depolarizing from rest and can facilitate action potential generation when combined with proximal excitatory input. Dendritic GABA responses were excitatory regardless of timing, whereas somatic GABA responses were inhibitory when coincident with excitatory input but excitatory at earlier times. These excitatory actions of GABA occur even though the GABA reversal potential is below action potential threshold and largely uniform across the somato-dendritic axis, and arise when GABAergic inputs are temporally or spatially isolated from concurrent excitation. Our findings demonstrate that under certain circumstances GABA will have an excitatory role in synaptic integration in the cortex."
https://openalex.org/W1985297370,"It was the aim of this study to further explore the functional role of vitamin D in the endocrine pancreas. By gene targeting, we have recently generated mice in which a lacZ reporter gene is driven by the endogenous vitamin D receptor (VDR) promoter. These mice express a functionally inactive mutant VDR. Pancreatic islets but not exocrine pancreas cells showed strong lacZ reporter gene expression in mutant mice. To rule out possible influences of hypocalcemia on pancreatic endocrine function, a rescue diet enriched with calcium, phosphorus, and lactose was fed to wild-type (WT) and VDR mutant mice. The rescue diet normalized body weight and mineral homeostasis in VDR mutants. In glucose tolerance tests, baseline blood glucose levels were unchanged in fasting VDR mutants. However, blood glucose was elevated after oral or subcutaneous glucose loading, and maximum serum insulin levels were reduced by approximately 60% in VDR mutants vs. WT mice on either diet. In addition, insulin mRNA levels were decreased in VDR mutant mice on both diets, whereas pancreatic beta cell mass, islet architecture, and islet neogenesis were normal. These findings clearly establish a molecular role of the vitamin D-responsive elements in pancreatic insulin synthesis and secretion in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2122926084,"It is often proposed that prefrontal cortex is important in organization and control of working memory contents. In some cases, effective reorganization can decrease task difficulty, implying a dissociation between frontal activity and basic memory demand. In a spatial working memory task, we studied the improvement of performance that occurs when materials can be reorganized into higher level groups or chunks. Structured sequences, encouraging reorganization and chunking, were compared with unstructured sequences. Though structured sequences were easier to remember, event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) showed increased activation of lateral frontal cortex, in particular during memory encoding. The results show that, even when memory demand decreases, organization of working memory contents into higher level chunks is associated with increased prefrontal activity."
https://openalex.org/W2090806860,"In the olfactory epithelium (OE), generation of new neurons by neuronal progenitors is inhibited by a signal from neurons themselves. Here we provide evidence that this feedback inhibitory signal is growth and differentiation factor 11 (GDF11). Both GDF11 and its receptors are expressed by OE neurons and progenitors, and GDF11 inhibits OE neurogenesis in vitro by inducing p27(Kip1) and reversible cell cycle arrest in progenitors. Mice lacking functional GDF11 have more progenitors and neurons in the OE, whereas mice lacking follistatin, a GDF11 antagonist, show dramatically decreased neurogenesis. This negative autoregulatory action of GDF11 is strikingly like that of its homolog, GDF8/myostatin, in skeletal muscle, suggesting that similar strategies establish and maintain proper cell number during neural and muscular development."
https://openalex.org/W2084742492,"Eighty percent of patients newly infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) develop chronic infection, suggesting that HCV can develop effective strategies to escape the unspecific and specific immune response of the host. Because SOCS molecules have been recognized to be powerful inhibitors of cytokine signaling via the Jak/STAT pathway, virus-induced expression of these molecules should be an efficient instrument to counteract the cellular response toward interferons (IFNs), an essential part of first line antiviral immune response. This study shows that overexpression of HCV core protein inhibits IFN-alpha-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of STAT1 in hepatic cells. With the use of a STAT1-YFP fusion protein, further evidence is given that HCV core is capable to inhibit nuclear translocation of STAT1. Inhibition of STAT1-tyrosine phosphorylation was accompanied by the induction of SOCS3-mRNA expression, suggesting that the HCV core protein impairs IFN-alpha-induced signal transduction via induction of SOCS3 expression. HCV core protein was competent to partially rescue growth of a genetically engineered influenza A virus lacking its own IFN antagonist. These IFN-antagonistic properties of the HCV core protein may be part of the molecular basis of IFN-alpha unresponsiveness in about one-half of chronically infected HCV-patients."
https://openalex.org/W2084686727,"The integration of local image features into global shapes was investigated in monkeys and humans using fMRI. An adaptation paradigm was used, in which stimulus selectivity was deduced by changes in the course of adaptation of a pattern of randomly oriented elements. Accordingly, we observed stronger activity when orientation changes in the adapting stimulus resulted in a collinear contour than a different random pattern. This selectivity to collinear contours was observed not only in higher visual areas that are implicated in shape processing, but also in early visual areas where selectivity depended on the receptive field size. These findings suggest that unified shape perception in both monkeys and humans involves multiple visual areas that may integrate local elements to global shapes at different spatial scales."
https://openalex.org/W2126525449,"Neuron-glia interactions are essential for synaptic function, and glial glutamate (re)uptake plays a key role at glutamatergic synapses. In knockout mice, for either glial glutamate transporters, GLAST or GLT-1, a classical metabolic response to synaptic activation (i.e., enhancement of glucose utilization) is decreased at an early functional stage in the somatosensory barrel cortex following activation of whiskers. Investigation in vitro demonstrates that glial glutamate transport represents a critical step for triggering enhanced glucose utilization, but also lactate release from astrocytes through a mechanism involving changes in intracellular Na(+) concentration. These data suggest that a metabolic crosstalk takes place between neurons and astrocytes in the developing cortex, which would be regulated by synaptic activity and mediated by glial glutamate transporters."
https://openalex.org/W2025885587,"The Drosophila circadian oscillator consists of interlocked period (per)/timeless (tim) and Clock (Clk) transcriptional/translational feedback loops. Within these feedback loops, CLK and CYCLE (CYC) activate per and tim transcription at the same time as they repress Clk transcription, thus controlling the opposite cycling phases of these transcripts. CLK-CYC directly bind E box elements to activate transcription, but the mechanism of CLK-CYC-dependent repression is not known. Here we show that a CLK-CYC-activated gene, vrille (vri), encodes a repressor of Clk transcription, thereby identifying vri as a key negative component of the Clk feedback loop in Drosophila's circadian oscillator. The blue light photoreceptor encoding cryptochrome (cry) gene is also a target for VRI repression, suggesting a broader role for VRI in the rhythmic repression of output genes that cycle in phase with Clk."
https://openalex.org/W1487168219,"The ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) is a major regulator of peripheral cholesterol efflux and plasma high density lipoprotein metabolism. In adult rat brain we found high expression of ABCA1 in neurons in the hypothalamus, thalamus, amygdala, cholinergic basal forebrain, and hippocampus. Large neurons of the cholinergic nucleus basalis together with CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons were among the most abundantly immunolabeled neurons. Glia cells were largely negative. Because cholesterol homeostasis may have an essential role in central nervous system function and neurodegeneration, we examined ABCA1 expression and function in different brain cell types using cultures of primary neurons, astrocytes, and microglia isolated from embryonic rat brain. The basal ABCA1 mRNA and protein levels detected in these cell types were increased markedly after exposure to oxysterols and 9-cis-retinoic acid, which are ligands for the nuclear hormone liver X receptors and retinoic X receptors, respectively. Functionally, the increased ABCA1 expression caused by these ligands was followed by elevated apoA-I- and apoE-specific cholesterol efflux in neurons and glia. In non-neuronal and neuronal cells overexpressing a human Swedish variant of amyloid precursor protein, 22R-hydroxycholesterol and 9-cis-retinoic acid induced ABCA1 expression and increased apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux consequently decreasing cellular cholesterol content. More importantly, we demonstrated that these ligands alone or in combination with apoA-I caused a substantial reduction in the stability of amyloid precursor protein C-terminal fragments and decreased amyloid β production. These effects of 22R-hydroxycholesterol may provide a novel strategy to decrease amyloid β secretion and consequently reduce the amyloid burden in the brain.

Hamon Y. Chimini G. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1007-1017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in the ABCA1 gene cause high density lipoprotein (HDL) deficiency syndromes, such as Tangier disease, which are characterized by the virtual absence of HDL and apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), cholesterol deposition in tissue macrophages, and prevalent atherosclerosis (2Brooks-Wilson A. Marcil M. Clee S.M. Zhang L.H. Roomp K. van Dam M. Yu L. Brewer C. Collins J.A. Molhuizen H.O. Loubser O. Ouelette B.F. Fichter K. Ashbourne-Excoffon K.J. Sensen C.W. Scherer S. Mott S. Denis M.

ABCA1 mediates cholesterol efflux and secretion of excess cholesterol from cells to lipid-free apolipoproteins and is a major determinant of plasma HDL concentration (4Oram J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Thus, ABCA1 controls reverse cholesterol transport, a metabolic pathway whereby excess cholesterol in peripheral tissues is removed and transported to the liver (5Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1173-1179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of its ability to deplete macrophages of cholesterol and to raise plasma HDL levels, ABCA1 has been studied mainly for its role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (5Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1173-1179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Attie A.D. Kastelein J.P. Hayden M.R. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1717-1726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, ABCA1 mRNA and protein are widely distributed among multiple tissues including brain (7Whitney K.D. Watson M.A. Collins J.L. Benson W.G. Stone T.M. Numerick M.J. Tippin T.K. Wilson J.G. Winegar D.A. Kliewer S.A. Mol.

Francone O. McManus B.M. Hayden M.R. Lab. Invest. 2002; 82: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), suggesting a more generalized role for ABCA1. Data regarding the possible physiological function of ABCA1 in the central nervous system, however, are limited. ABCA1 expression and ABCA1-mediated lipid secretory pathway are regulated by hydroxysterols and 9-cis-retinoic acid, ligands for nuclear hormone liver X receptors (LXRs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs), respectively (9Venkateswaran A. Laffitte B.A. Joseph S.B. Mak P.A. Wilpitz D.C. Edwards P.A. Tontonoz P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12097-12102Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). The LXRs function as heterodimers with RXRs, and these dimers can be activated by ligands for either receptor (10Repa J.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1243-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In conditions that result in high cholesterol levels, LXR activation increases the mRNA levels of several target genes primarily involved in lipid metabolism including ATP-binding transporters. Nuclear receptors LXR and RXR are also expressed in neurons and glia (7Whitney K.D. Watson M.A. Collins J.L. Benson W.G. Stone T.M. Numerick M.J. Tippin T.K. Wilson J.G. Winegar D.A. Kliewer S.A.

Although the central nervous system comprises less than 10% of the total body mass, it contains approximately one quarter of all of the unesterified cholesterol (12Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Almost all of the central nervous system cholesterol is derived from in situbiosynthesis and is transported by lipoproteins similar to plasma HDL (13Pitas R.E. Boyles J.K. Lee S.H. Hui D. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14352-14360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The main apolipoproteins are apoE, produced by astrocytes (14Poirier J. Baccichet A. Dea D. Gauthier S. Neuroscience. 1993; 55: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) and microglia (15Nakai M. Kawamata T. Taniguchi T. Maeda K. Tanaka C. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 211: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and apoA-I from the systemic circulation or from brain endothelial cells (16Panzenboeck U. Balazs Z. Sovic A. Hrzenjak A. Levak-Frank S. Wintersperger A. Malle E. Sattler W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42781-42789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Mutations that affect the synthesis and intracellular traffic of cholesterol in neurons lead to neurodegeneration like that is seen in Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (17Steiner R.D. Linck L.M. Flavell D.P. Lin D.S. Connor W.E. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1437-1447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Niemann-Pick type C disease (18Xie C. Turley S.D. Dietschy J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11992-11997Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and disturbances in brain cholesterol metabolism may contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (19Papassotiropoulos A. Lutjohann D. Bagli M. Locatelli S. Jessen F. Buschfort R. Ptok U. Bjorkhem I. von Bergmann K. Heun R. J. Psychiatr. Res. 2002; 36: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). AD is a senile dementia, characterized by extracellular deposits of amyloid β (Aβ) peptide, derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage (20De Strooper B. Annaert W. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1857-1870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To generate Aβ, a small percentage of APP is cleaved by two enzymes: β-secretase-1 (21Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J. Edenson S. Lile J. Jarosinski M.A. Biere A.L. Curran E. Burgess T. Louis J.C. Collins F. Treanor J. Rogers G. Citron M. Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3327) Google Scholar) and a still unidentified γ-secretase, producing two secreted products, Aβ and soluble APPβ (sAPPβ). Most of the APP is cut by a proteinase named α-secretase-generating soluble APPα (sAPPα). The residual C-terminal APP fragment (CTF-α) remains within the plasma membrane and can be cleaved by γ-secretase activity yielding p3 fragment and thus precluding Aβ production. Previous in vitro studies have shown that cellular cholesterol modulates APP processing in cell lines and primary neurons. Aβ production and secretion are reduced dramatically when cellular cholesterol levels are decreased by inhibiting de novo synthesis with hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (22Fassbender K. Simons M. Bergmann C. Stroick M. Lutjohann D. Keller P. Runz H. Kuhl S. Bertsch T. von Bergmann K. Hennerici M. Beyreuther K. Hartmann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, elevated cellular cholesterol levels decrease α-secretase activity (24Kojro E. Gimpl G. Lammich S. Marz W. Fahrenholz F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5815-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar) and increase β- and γ-secretase activity (25Wahrle S. Das P. Nyborg A.C. McLendon C. Shoji M. Kawarabayashi T. Younkin L.H.

To clarify further the central nervous system function of ABCA1, we first examined ABCA1 expression and transcriptional regulation in brain cells. We found high expression of ABCA1 in neurons in the cortex, basal forebrain, and hippocampus of the rat brain. We then demonstrated ABCA1 transcriptional up-regulation by established ligands for the LXRs/RXRs and a functional increase in apolipoprotein-mediated cholesterol efflux in primary neuronal and glial cultures. More importantly, we showed that in non-neuronal and neuronal cells overexpressing a human Swedish variant of APP (APPsw), ligand-activated LXR/RXR, alone or in combination with ABCA1-mediated cholesterol depletion, caused substantial reduction in the stability of APP C-terminal fragments and decreased Aβ production. The following were purchased from Sigma and used in all experiments: delipidated calf serum, β-mercaptoethanol,l-glutamine, 22R-hydroxycholesterol (22R), 9-cis-retinoic acid (RA), 22S-OH cholesterol (22S), leupeptin, aprotinin, and AEBSF. We obtained 1,2-[3H]cholesterol (specific activity 45 Ci/μmol) from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Tissue culture flasks and plates were from Corning (Corning, NY) and Falcon (Lincoln, NJ). 22R, RA, and 22S were dissolved in ethanol. Microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2) and rat integrin (CD11b) mouse antibodies (Abs) were from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein Ab was from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal anti-ABCA1 was from Novus (Littleton, CO). Goat anti-ABCA1 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). TAU-5 Ab was from NeoMarkers (Fremont, CA). Mouse anti-β-tubulin Ab was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The 6E10 monoclonal Ab (Signet, Dedham, MA) recognizes the first 17 amino acids of the Aβ peptide. 6E10 Ab was used for Western blotting to detect full-length APP (APPfl) and sAPPα and for immunoprecipitation of total Ab. Rabbit C8 polyclonal Ab (generous gift from Dr. Denis Selkoe, Harvard University) was used to detect CTF resulting from α- or β-secretase cleavages. Secondary Abs conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and to alkaline phosphatase were from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Alexa-labeled secondary Abs and DiL-Ac-LDL were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Primary neuronal cultures were made from dissociated cortices and hippocampi of 17–19-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat embryos as described previously (27Banker G.A. Cowan W.M. Brain Res. 1977; 126: 397-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). Briefly, cortices and hippocampi were dissected and incubated with 1× trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen) for 10 min at room temperature. The trypsin was inactivated with complete defined neurobasal medium supplemented with B27, GlutaMax II, 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics (medium and additives were from Invitrogen). A single cell suspension was obtained after filtering through a 70-μm Falcon cell strainer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). For all experiments except immunostaining, neurons were plated at a high density (2 × 106/ml, 2 ml/well) on 100 μg/ml poly-d-lysine-coated six-well Costar plates (Stony Brook, NY). For immunostaining neurons were plated at low density (2 × 105/ml, 0.250 ml/well) on 200 μg/ml poly-d-lysine-coated Nunc Permanox chamber slides (Nalge, Naperville, IL). One h after plating the medium was changed with complete neurobasal medium as above, without serum. At day in vitro 2 the neuronal cultures were treated with cytosine-β-d-arabinoside (4 μm final concentration) to suppress proliferation of non-neuronal dividing cells. Mixed glial cultures were isolated from the cerebral cortices of 21-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat embryos or newborn pups as described previously (28Giulian D. Baker T.J. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 2163-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cortices were minced and dissociated by trituration in 0.25% trypsin and 0.01% DNase-I. After the addition of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (growth medium), the supernatant was passed through a 70-μm cell strainer, resuspended in growth medium, and plated in poly-l-lysine-coated T75 Falcon flasks at a density of 1.5–2.0 × 107 cells/flask. The mixed glial cultures were grown for 1 week before collecting the microglia and astrocytes. To isolate microglia, we cultured the cells for 7 days and then vigorously agitated the confluent cultures on a rotary shaker for 15 h (37 °C, 180 rpm). The resulting cell suspension, which was rich in microglia and oligodendroglia, was placed in T75 plastic flasks (1 × 105/ml, total volume of 10 ml) and allowed to adhere at 37 °C. After a 1–3-h adhering interval, loosely adhering cells (most of which were oligodendroglia) were removed by gently shaking the flasks at room temperature. The strongly adhering microglia were then released by vigorous shaking in defined medium with 0.2% trypsin, resuspended, and 15% fetal bovine serum was added. The purity of microglial cultures was assessed by the uptake of DiL-Ac-LDL according to the original protocol (28Giulian D. Baker T.J. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 2163-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the manufacturer's instructions. More than 95% of the cells harvested from the medium after shaking took up DiL-Ac-LDL. To isolate astrocytes from the mixed glial culture, we harvested the adherent astroglial cells, which were detached by trypsin/EDTA treatment. These cells were then collected, pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in fresh growth medium. Antibodies to the following markers were used to identify the specific cell types: MAP-2 for neurons, glial fibrillary acidic protein for astrocytes, and CD11b for microglia. The purity of these enriched neuronal, astroglial, and microglial cultures as determined by the specific staining of the markers was greater than 95%. All cells were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% air. Cells were seeded in six-well plates or T25 Corning flasks, and then astrocytes and microglia were grown to 80–90% confluence before use. Astrocytes were used up to six passages. CHOAPPsw cells (a generous gift from Dr. Ruth Perez, University of Pittsburgh) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 500 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) as described before (29Perez R.G. Soriano S. Hayes J.D. Ostaszewski B. Xia W. Selkoe D.J. Chen X. Stokin G.B. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18851-18856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). H4 cells were obtained from ATCC and transfected with pcDNA3.1HygroAPPsw. A stable cell line was established after a 1-month selection with 250 μg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen) (33Lefterov I.M. Koldamova R.P. Lazo J.S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1837-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To determine the expression of ABCA1 in neurons and glia, we used reverse transcription followed by PCR amplification (RT-PCR). Total RNA from enriched primary embryonic rat neuronal, astrocytic, and microglial cell cultures was isolated using RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using a DU640 spectrophotometer (Beckman). Mouse forward ABCA1–341F (5′-TCCCGGCGAGGCTCCCGGTGT-3′) and reverse ABCA1–899R (5′-CAGCTCTTGGGCCAGGCCCCC-3′) primers (NCBI accession NM_013454) were used for semiquantitative RT-PCR. The primers for rodent GAPDH (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) were used to amplify an internal control. Semiquantitative RT-PCR for rat ABCA1 levels was performed using 0.5 μg of total RNA and two-step RT-PCR. The reverse transcription reaction and synthesis of the first-strand cDNA were run at 42 °C for 60 min using Advantage RT-For-PCR (Clontech) and random primer hexamer. The PCR was carried out for 40 cycles (denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing and extension at 60 °C for 1 min) using a PCR kit (Promega) and the above ABCA1 primers. Data quantification and analysis were calculated relative to the level of the control. Each sample was assayed in triplicate during two independent experiments. Northern blotting was performed as reported previously (30Bortnick A.E. Rothblat G.H. Stoudt G. Hoppe K.L. Royer L.J. McNeish J. Francone O.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28634-28640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Total RNA (∼5 μg) was separated on 1% denaturing agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde (Ambion, Austin, TX), transferred to NytranSuperCharge membrane (Schleicher & Schuell), UV cross-linked, and processed for detection of mRNA using NorthernMaxTM system (Ambion). A 518-bp digoxigenin-labeled antisense single stranded DNA probe was generated by asymmetric PCR amplification using a DIG Probe Synthesis kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), ABCA1–879R primer and 2 μl of the first strand cDNA reaction as generated for the RT-PCR. Overnight hybridization of the probe to the immobilized RNA was carried out in ULTRAhyb™ Ultrasensitive Hybridization Buffer (Ambion), and the membrane was processed in digoxigenin Wash and Block Buffer set (Roche). To verify equal loading of RNA, we stripped the ABCA1 probe from the membranes and rehybridized them with a rodent GAPDH control probe. The hybridized probe/anti-IG-alkaline phosphatase complex was visualized on x-ray film (Kodak) after incubation of the membrane with CDP-Star ultrasensitive chemiluminescent substrate for alkaline phosphatase (Roche). The relative intensities of the hybridization signals were determined by densitometry (Molecular Dynamics, model 300A) and quantified. For cholesterol efflux studies, monolayers of cells were washed and then incubated for 24 h in complete culture medium containing 2 μCi/ml 1,2-[3H]cholesterol, antibiotics, and 10% fetal bovine serum, as described previously (30Bortnick A.E.

Parallel cultures incubated with nonradioactive cholesterol were used to measure and compare the amount of ABCA1 protein and its mRNA levels. After the 24-h labeling period, cells were washed and then incubated with medium plus 1% delipidated calf serum (Sigma) plus or minus the indicated ligands (10 μm 22R and 10 μmRA). After this 8-h incubation, some of the wells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and the cells lysed in 0.5n NaOH. These wells provided a base line (time zero = T0) value for total 1,2-[3H]cholesterol content for time course experiments. Unlabeled monolayers were harvested for total RNA isolation or protein analysis at different time points. Cells containing 1,2-[3H]cholesterol were treated with LXR/RXR ligands 22R (10 μm) and RA (10 μm). These cells and vehicle control cells were washed with medium and incubated for 24 h or in the time course experiments for 4–24 h in the presence or absence of cholesterol acceptors (apoA-I or apoE). ApoA-I from human plasma and recombinant apoE3 (Sigma) were used at concentrations of 15–30 μg/ml. After incubation, the medium was centrifuged to remove any cells. The cells were washed and lysed in NaOH. Aliquots of medium and cell lysates were assayed by liquid scintillation counting. The percent efflux was calculated by dividing the radioactivity in the medium by the sum of the radioactivity in the medium and cell lysate. Apolipoprotein-specific [3H]cholesterol efflux was measured as the fraction of total radiolabeled cholesterol (cells and medium) appearing in the medium in the presence of apolipoproteins after subtraction of values for apolipoprotein-free medium. For time course experiments cholesterol efflux was quantified by removing replicate 150-μl aliquots of the incubation medium containing the indicated acceptor at different time points and the cholesterol efflux determined as above. The radioactivity of the cell lysate at the starting point were considered as total cholesterol. Cells were washed in PBS and divided in half for determination of cholesterol content and for protein extraction. Cholesterol mass was determined as described previously (32Chinetti G. Lestavel S. Bocher V. Remaley A.T. Neve B. Torra I.P. Teissier E. Minnich A. Jaye M. Duverger N. Brewer H.B. Fruchart J.C. Clavey V. Staels B. Nat.

Extraction was performed with chloroform:isopropyl alcohol (3:1), and after centrifugation clear supernatant was decanted. The solvent was evaporated under nitrogen, the residue dissolved, and total cholesterol (free cholesterol and cholesteryl esters) concentration determined by enzymatic assay (Infinity cholesterol reagent, Sigma) using a standard curve with cholesterol standards from Sigma. The cholesterol mass was normalized to the total protein (μg of cholesterol/mg of protein). For Western blot analysis cellular extracts were prepared from primary neurons, microglia, and astrocytes. Cells were washed and scraped in PBS and lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.25% SDS, 1% Triton X-100 in the presence of protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride). Cellular extracts were centrifuged to remove debris. For ABCA1 Western blot analysis, extracts containing 20–50 μg of total protein were reduced with 2-mercaptoethanol in NuPAGETM loading buffer (without boiling), loaded, electrophoresed on 3–8% NuPAGETM Tris acetate gels (Novex, San Diego), and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. ABCA1 was detected with a rabbit primary Ab raised against human ABCA1 protein. For Western blot analyses of APPfl, CTF, sAPPa, and Aβ, we used cellular extracts and conditioned media and 10–20% Tricine gels. Membranes were then incubated with a goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and processed for visualization by enhanced chemiluminescence ECL Plus™ (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Western blotting with anti-β-tubulin Aβ was used as an internal standard. The relative intensities of the bands were quantified by densitometry (Molecular Dynamics). Immunoprecipitation and ELISA for Aβ were performed essentially as before (33Lefterov I.M. Koldamova R.P. Lazo J.S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1837-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 34Lefterov I.M. Koldamova R.P. Lefterova M.I. Schwartz D.R. Lazo J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, Aβ was immunoprecipitated from the conditioned medium and immunoblotted using the 6E10 Ab. ELISA for Aβ was performed using the same 6E10 as the capture Ab and anti-Ab40 and anti-Ab42 polyclonal Abs (BioSource International, Camarillo, CA) to detect Ab1–40 and Ab1–42, respectively. The amount of Aβ was normalized either to the total protein or to the expression of APPfl as measured by Western blotting. The study fully conformed to the guidelines outlined in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and was approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Young mid-age (250–275 g) Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital (Nembutal, 80–100 mg/kg; Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) and perfused transcardially with 100 ml 0.1 m PBS (pH 7.4) followed by 500 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde with 15% saturated picric acid in 0.1 mphosphate buffer (pH 7.4). After perfusion, the brain was removed and placed into the same fixative for 30 min, then immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde in neutral 0.1 m phosphate buffer at 4 °C overnight. The brain was transferred to 15% sucrose in 0.1m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 4 °C for 24 h, then to 30% sucrose in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 4 °C until it sank. The cryoprotected brain was frozen and cut in coronal plane on a cryostat (Jung CM 1800; Brodersen Instrument, Valencia, PA) at a 40-μm thickness. Immunohistochemistry for ABCA1 was conducted using the free floating technique as described previously (35Ikonomovic M.D. Sheffield R. Armstrong D.M. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 359: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2098995242,"Senescence is generally defined as an irreversible state of G1 cell cycle arrest in which cells are refractory to growth factor stimulation. In mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), induction of senescence requires the presence of p19ARF and p53, as genetic ablation of either of these genes allows escape from senescence and leads to immortalization. We have developed a lentiviral vector that directs the synthesis of a p53-specific short hairpin transcript, which mediates stable suppression of p53 expression through RNA interference. We show that suppression of p53 expression in senescent MEFs leads to rapid cell cycle re-entry, is associated with loss of expression of senescence-associated genes, and leads to immortalization. These data indicate that senescence in MEFs is reversible and demonstrate that both initiation and maintenance of senescence is p53-dependent."

We show that the LOC activation is due to the globally completed region and occurs even when the region is not bounded by illusory contours (ICs). Kanizsa-type stimuli were modified by rounding the corners of the ""pacmen"" inducers and misaligning them slightly. The impression of an enclosed, salient region (SR) remained, although ICs were no longer perceived (psychophysical data). fMRI activity was elevated for both the IC and SR stimuli, compared to their control stimuli. The LOC response to salient regions may be the result of fast but crude region-based segmentation processes, which are useful for selecting parts of cluttered images for more detailed, computationally intensive processing."
https://openalex.org/W1985445026,"Different classes of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) in Drosophila innervate distinct targets, or glomeruli, in the antennal lobe of the brain. Here we demonstrate that specific ORN classes require the cell surface protein Dscam (Down Syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecule) to synapse in the correct glomeruli. Dscam mutant ORNs frequently terminated in ectopic sites both within and outside the antennal lobe. The morphology of Dscam mutant axon terminals in either ectopic or cognate targets was abnormal. Target specificity for other ORNs was not altered in Dscam mutants, suggesting that different ORNs use different strategies to regulate wiring. Multiple forms of Dscam RNA were detected in the developing antenna, and Dscam protein was localized to developing ORN axons. We propose a role for Dscam protein diversity in regulating ORN target specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1985262580,"Synaptic activation is associated with rapid changes in intracellular Ca2+, while the extracellular Ca2+ level is generally assumed to be constant. Here, using a novel optical method to measure changes in extracellular Ca2+ at high spatial and temporal resolution, we find that brief trains of synaptic transmission in hippocampal area CA1 induce transient depletion of extracellular Ca2+. We show that this depletion, which depends on postsynaptic NMDA receptor activation, decreases the Ca2+ available to enter individual presynaptic boutons of CA3 pyramidal cells. This in turn reduces the probability of consecutive synaptic releases at CA3−CA1 synapses and therefore contributes to short-term paired-pulse depression of minimal responses. This activity-dependent depletion of extracellular Ca2+ represents a novel form of fast retrograde synaptic signaling that can modulate glutamatergic information transfer in the brain."

Their capacity to divide is modulated along the anterior-posterior body axis, but the mechanism underlying this is unclear.

A burst of expression of the Hox protein Abdominal-A (AbdA) specifies the time at which apoptosis occurs, thereby determining the final number of progeny that each neuroblast generates. These studies identify a mechanism linking the Hox axial patterning system to neural proliferation, and this involves temporal regulation of precursor cell death rather than the cell cycle."

This phenotypic change, termed “activation,” has been modeled in vitro by culturing HSCs on uncoated plastic. Freshly isolated HSC appear undifferentiated and are traditionally termed “quiescent,” whereas cells grown on uncoated plastic for 5 to 7 days become activated. In response to TGF-β, culture-activated cells produce extracellular matrix that is similar in composition to that seen in the fibrotic liver (7Milani S. Herbst H. Schuppan D. Grappone C.

The activated TβRI phosphorylates Smad2 or Smad3, members of the Smad family of cytoplasmic and nuclear signaling molecules, which are specific for the signaling pathways of TGF-β and the related growth factor activin. Phosphorylated Smads 2 and 3 form heteromeric complexes with Smad4, a Smad common to the signaling pathways of multiple TGF-β superfamily members, and move into the nucleus where they join other transcription factors to form transcriptionally active complexes (14Piek E. Heldin C.H. Ten Dijke P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2105-2124Google Scholar).

Furthermore, studies with passaged fibroblasts derived from Smad2 or Smad3 null mouse embryos suggest that, although both Smads contribute to TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 up-regulation, Smad3 is primarily responsible for the autocrine production of TGF-β and Smad2 for matrix metalloproteinase-2 up-regulation (26Piek E.

Chem. 2001; 276: 19945-19953Google Scholar).In this report we have examined TGF-β signaling in primary HSC as they undergo in vitro activation. We demonstrate that there is a dissociation between the cell cycle and matrix effects of TGF-β in HSC, with growth inhibition occurring only in phenotypically quiescent cells while TGF-β-mediated matrix deposition is observed in HSC at all stages. Smad4 in these cells is constitutively expressed in both nucleus and cytoplasm independent of TGF-β treatment. Smads 2 and 3, however, are phosphorylated and translocate into the nucleus in response to TGF-β, although the pattern varies with the state of activation: Smad2 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation occurs primarily in quiescent and intermediate cells, whereas Smad3 activation occurs primarily in activated cells. SARA is expressed in quiescent HSC but is lost with in vitro activation in parallel with the loss of TGF-β-mediated Smad2 phosphorylation. In day 7 HSC, in addition to TGF-β-responsive Smad3 activation, we also observed constitutive phosphorylation and nuclear localization of Smad2. Treatment with a TβRI kinase inhibitor or with TGF-β or activin-neutralizing antibodies does not diminish this constitutive activation. These results demonstrate essential differences between TGF-β-mediated Smad signaling pathways in quiescent and in vitro-transdifferentiated HSC, and suggest that both TGF-β-dependent and -independent Smad activation occurs in activated HSC.RESULTSCulturing rat HSC on uncoated plastic is a well-establishedin vitro model of HSC activation. HSC at day 1 after isolation demonstrate a quiescent phenotype, with a round shape, abundant lipid droplets, and a lack of α-smooth muscle actin expression. Cells at day 7 are spread out, have few lipid droplets, and express α-smooth muscle actin, consistent with the activated phenotype. Cells at day 4 have an intermediate phenotype. We used this model system to study differences in TGF-β signaling pathways at different stages of phenotypic differentiation. Data in the literature regarding the effects of TGF-β on quiescent and activated cells are contradictory, and the definition of quiescence and activation varies; therefore, as a preface to studying TGF-β signaling in HSC, we systematically defined their response to TGF-β.TGF-β-mediated Inhibition of DNA SynthesisWe first characterized the growth response to TGF-β. As assayed by [3H]thymidine incorporation, quiescent HSC (day 1) demonstrated marked inhibition of DNA synthesis in response to TGF-β (10–500 pm), with a decrease in incorporation of up to 83% and an IC50 of 10 pm (Fig.1), similar to what has been reported for phenotypically quiescent cells by other groups (36Dooley S. Delvoux B. Lahme B. Mangasser-Stephan K. Gressner A.M. Hepatology. 2000; 31: 1094-1106Google Scholar). In contrast, cells at days 4 and 7 after isolation demonstrated no change in DNA synthesis even with 500 pm TGF-β, although these cells displayed a 3.4-fold higher baseline rate of thymidine incorporation in day 7 than in day 1 cells (Fig. 1).TGF-β-mediated Matrix DepositionWe also characterized TGF-β-mediated changes in the expression of various matrix components. Collagen mRNA synthesis and secretion are modestly but significantly increased in response to TGF-β at days 4 and 7 (Fig.2, A and B). Similar findings were seen for deposited collagen (data not shown). PAI-1 protein expression was increased (1.4- to 2.3-fold) with TGF-β treatment at all three time points (Fig. 2 B). Similar findings were seen for fibronectin (Fig. 2 D) and glycosaminoglycans, including decorin (Fig. 2, A(middle panel) and E). TGF-β-mediated increases in expression were modest (generally less than 2-fold), and, although baseline synthesis of matrix components increased in activated cells, the degree of up-regulation in response to TGF-β was similar in quiescent and activated cells. Although it is often written that TGF-β is strongly profibrogenic in HSC, most studies of rat HSC in the literature report less than 3-fold induction of matrix components by TGF-β (13Knittel T.

B, collagen secretion was measured by differential collagenase sensitivity of [3H]proline-labeled secreted proteins and was increased in response to TGF-β at days 4 and 7 (*, p < 0.05 for both days; six samples for each condition). C, HSC treated (+) or not (−) with TGF-β were lysed, and lysates were immunoblotted with an antibody raised against PAI-1 (upper panel). As a control, aliquots of the same lysate were immunoblotted with an antibody against β-tubulin. D, HSC were treated with TGF-β for 16 h and metabolically labeled, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Media were collected and immunoprecipitated with an antibody against fibronectin. For comparison, experiments with fibronectin and PAI-1 performed in parallel with Mv1Lu cells, widely used for TGF-β studies, demonstrate a 3- to 4-fold enhancement of synthesis with TGF-β treatment (data not shown). E, HSC were treated with TGF-β1 for 24 h and labeled with [3H]glucosamine to determine secreted glycosaminoglycans, as described. Data are shown as percent increase for plus TGF-β compared with minus TGF-β. **, p < 0.05; *, p < 0.06 for −/+ TGF-β comparison. Six replicates were counted for each condition. Results were similar for matrix deposition of glycosaminoglycans (data not shown). Results for each panel are representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Smad 4 ActivationTo study the activation of Smad4 in HSC, cytoplasmic and nuclear lysates from cells at different stages of activation were immunoblotted with an antibody against the entire Smad4 coding sequence. There was no significant change in overall levels of Smad4 in cells 1, 4, or 7 days after isolation (Fig.3 A). Treatment with TGF-β for 15 min resulted in minimal increases in nuclear Smad4 at days 1 and 4, although Smad4 was present in the nucleus even in the absence of TGF-β. Immunodetection of blots with cytoplasmic (HSP-70) and nuclear (PCNA) marker proteins confirmed the purity of the different fractions.Figure 3Smad4 is constitutively present in the nucleus and cytoplasm, independent of TGF-β. A, primary HSC at days 1, 4, and 7 were treated plus or minus 100 pm TGF-β1 for 15 min and then lysed. Lysates were separated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions and were immunoblotted with antibodies against Smad4 (top panel) and, to confirm the purity of the fractions, HSP70 (middle panel) and PCNA (lower panel). Sizes are indicated in kilodaltons. All three blots were prepared from the same lysate. The results are representative of five independent experiments. We consistently see two faster bands in the cytoplasm at day 4, with a corresponding reduction in the intensity of the major signal. The significance of proteolysis of Smad4, especially at day 4, is not known, although it has been observed by others (68Feldmann K. Sebald W. Knaus P. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1393-1402Google Scholar).B, primary HSC at day 7 after isolation were placed in serum-free media, then treated with leptomycin B (20 ng/ml) for 0, 15, 30, or 60 min, or with TGF-β1 (100 pm; β) or TGF-β and leptomycin B (L/β) for 15 min, then lysed and immunoblotted with antibodies against Smad4. There was no significant nuclear accumulation of Smad4 with leptomycin B treatment. Serially stripping the membrane and re-immunoblotting with antibodies against Smad2 and Smad3 gives similar negative findings (data not shown). This blot is representative of results obtained in three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)A recent study reported the existence of widely expressed Smad4 isoforms that constitutively shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm and are able to form complexes with Smad2 in the nucleus (41Pierreux C.E. Nicolas F.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9041-9054Google Scholar). To determine whether this accounts for the Smad4 we observed constitutively in the nucleus, we treated day 7 cells with leptomycin B, an inhibitor of CRM1-mediated nuclear export. There was no significant accumulation of Smad4 in the nucleus after leptomycin B treatment, indicating that the shuttling observed by Pierreux et al. (41Pierreux C.E. Nicolas F.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9041-9054Google Scholar) does not explain our observations.Differences in Smad2 and Smad3 ActivationSmad2 phosphorylation in response to TGF-β changed dramatically as cells underwent in vitro activation (Fig.4). This is shown for both total lysates and nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. Treatment of cells at days 1 and 4 with TGF-β for 15 min resulted in a dramatic increase in phosphorylation of Smad2 (Fig. 4, A and B) as well as a shift from cytoplasm to nucleus (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, Smad3 was phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus in response to TGF-β primarily at days 4 and 7 (Fig. 4, A andB). Interestingly, there was a significant portion of constitutively phosphorylated and constitutively nuclear Smad2 and, to a lesser extent, Smad3, present at days 4 and 7.Consistent with the stable total protein levels of Smads 2 and 3 (Fig.4 B and data not shown), no change in the message levels of either Smad was seen with short (0–90 min) or long (24 h) term treatment of cells with TGF-β (Fig. 4 C), although an additional transcript for Smad2 was seen at days 4 and 7. This band was specific: an identical pattern was also seen on different blots probed with a different, non-overlapping probe (data not shown). Two or more bands specific for Smad2 by Northern blotting have been reported previously (25Choy L. Skillington J. Derynck R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 667-682Google Scholar, 42Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.E. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Google Scholar, 43Wu D. Luo S. Wang Y. Zhuang L. Chen Y. Peng C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 175: 111-121Google Scholar), although their significance is not known. A splice variant of Smad2 that, unlike the wild type, is able to bind DNA, has been reported (24Yagi K. Goto D. Hamamoto T. Takenoshita S. Kato M. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 703-709Google Scholar) and may account for this additional band, although one recent report demonstrated neither multiple bands for Smad2 nor changes in the splice variant with HSC activation (45Dooley S. Streckert M. Delvoux B. Gressner A.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 554-562Google Scholar). In contrast to other reports (45Dooley S. Streckert M. Delvoux B. Gressner A.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 554-562Google Scholar), we consistently observed a single transcript for Smad3 in HSC.The FYVE Protein SARA Decreases with ActivationThe linker protein SARA recruits Smad2 to the TGF-β receptor complex and is necessary for maximal Smad2-mediated TGF-β signaling (15Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Google Scholar). The relationship between SARA and Smad3 is less clear, and one report suggests that SARA is required for Smad2- but not Smad3-mediated TGF-β signaling (46Goto D. Nakajima H. Mori Y. Kurasawa K. Kitamura N. Iwamoto I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 1100-1105Google Scholar). We therefore examined HSC undergoing in vitro activation for changes in SARA expression, looking for correlations between SARA expression and Smad activation. By Western immunoblotting, we noted a dramatic decrease in SARA levels in HSC from day 1 to day 4 after isolation; SARA was not detectable in HSC cultured for 7 days (Fig. 4 D).Constitutively Phosphorylated and Nuclear Smads Do Not Result from Autocrine TGF-β SignalingWe observed a significant amount of constitutively phosphorylated Smads 2 and 3, particularly Smad2, present in the nucleus at days 4 and 7 (Fig. 4 B). This does not represent contamination of the different fractions (see controls in Fig. 3 A); additionally, two different TGF-β-responsive cell lines (L6 myoblasts and LLC-PK1 proximal tubule epithelial cells) demonstrated phospho-Smad2 only in nuclear fractions. 2O. Eickelberg and R. G. Wells, unpublished observations. One possibility is that this represents a response to autocrine TGF-β production, although increased production of active (as opposed to latent) TGF-β has not been observed in culture-activated cells (12Bissell D.M. Wang S.S. Jarnagin W.R. Roll F.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 447-455Google Scholar, 47Bachem M.G. Meyer D. Melchior R. Sell K.M. Gressner A.M. J. Clin.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 502: 4-10Google Scholar), and the responsiveness of our cells to exogenous TGF-β in other assays argues against saturation of the TGF-β signaling machinery. To answer this question definitively, we treated HSC with both TGF-β-neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 5, B andC) and with a specific TβRI kinase inhibitor (Fig. 5,A and B). Neither treatment altered the baseline nuclear localization or constitutive phosphorylation of Smad2 or Smad3, indicating that it is not the result of autocrine TGF-β production.Figure 5Constitutive activation of Smads 2 and 3 at day 7 is not the result of autocrine TGF-β or activin signaling. A, HSC at days 1, 4, and 7 were treated overnight with 0.1 μm NPC-34016 TβRI inhibitor, then lysed and analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against phospho-Smad2, total Smad2, or total Smad3 (the same blot was stripped and reprobed sequentially). A separate blot was probed with antibody against phospho-Smad3. B, HSC at day 7 were treated with either the inhibitor (as in A) or with 1 μg/ml of a pan-TGF-β-neutralizing antibody (T) and analyzed as inA. C, HSC were treated overnight with antibodies against TGF-β (as in B (T)) or against activin (0.06 (A 1) or 0.6 μg/ml (A 10)) overnight, then lysed and immunoblotted as above with antibodies against Smad2 or (using the same lysates) Smad 3. All blots shown are representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Autocrine Activin Signaling Does Not Cause Constitutive Smad ActivationIt has been reported that the TGF-β superfamily member activin is produced in an autocrine fashion by activated HSC (50De Bleser P.J. Niki T. Xu G. Rogiers V. Geerts A. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 905-912Google Scholar). Because activin downstream signaling pathways share Smad2 and Smad3 with TGF-β signaling pathways, we treated day 7 HSC with neutralizing antibodies against activin A and immunoblotted the lysates to determine whether activin is responsible for the activation state or distribution of Smads 2 and 3 (Fig. 5 C). We saw no change in the constitutive nuclear localization of Smads 2 or 3, indicating that it is not the result of autocrine activin signaling.DISCUSSIONOur data demonstrate in an in vitro model of HSC activation that: 1) there is a dissociation between the growth regulatory and matrix-inducing effects of TGF-β as HSC become activated; 2) activation is associated with a shift in TGF-β signaling pathways such that TGF-β predominantly activates Smad2 in quiescent cells and Smad3 in activated cells; 3) Smad4 is present constitutively in the nucleus and cytoplasm of HSC, and its distribution does not change in response to TGF-β; 4) Smad 2 and, to a lesser extent, Smad3, are constitutively activated in activated HSCin vitro; and 5) this constitutive activation is not due to autocrine TGF-β or activin signaling.We clearly demonstrate in this physiological system that there is a dissociation between the cell cycle and matrix effects of TGF-β. TGF-β treatment resulted in growth inhibition in HSC only at day 1, but caused increased expression of matrix components in cells at all stages of in vitro transdifferentiation; although the background expression of matrix components was increased in culture-activated HSC, the -fold induction by TGF-β did not change significantly. Our results are consistent with descriptions of the behavior of HSC in bile duct-ligated rats and smooth muscle cells in human atherosclerotic lesions (3Roulot D. Sevcsik A.M. Coste T. Strosberg A.D. Marullo S. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1730-1738Google Scholar, 51McCaffrey T.A. Consigli S. Du B. Falcone D.J. Sanborn T.A. Spokojny A.M. Bush Jr., H.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2667-2675Google Scholar). Interestingly, although there are several reports of engineered or malignant cell lines that have lost TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition while retaining matrix responses, there are no reports of the reverse scenario (52Chen R.H. Ebner R. Derynck R. Science. 1993; 260: 1335-1338Google Scholar, 53Franzen P. Ichijo H. Miyazono K. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 207: 1-7Google Scholar, 54Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Amagasa T. Miyazono K.

Commun. 1999; 259: 385-390Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that there is a higher threshold of Smad activation required for growth inhibition than for matrix induction (3Roulot D. Sevcsik A.M. Coste T. Strosberg A.D. Marullo S. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1730-1738Google Scholar,52Chen R.H. Ebner R. Derynck R. Science. 1993; 260: 1335-1338Google Scholar, 56Wrana J.L. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1909-1910Google Scholar). Whether this is correct has yet to be determined.In activated rat HSC in culture, TGF-β treatment results in the net deposition of abnormal matrix by up-regulation of multiple matrix components, including proteoglycans, collagen, and fibronectin, and protease inhibitors (11Friedman S.L. Yamasaki G. Wong L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10551-10558Google Scholar, 13Knittel T. Janneck T. Muller L. Fellmer P. Ramadori G. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 352-360Google Scholar, 37Knittel T. Fellmer P.

However, the role of a specific isoform of Src kinase in regulation of tight junction is not known. In the present study the role of c-Src in regulation of epithelial tight junction was investigated in Caco-2 cell monolayers. Oxidative stress (xanthine oxidase + xanthine) induced an activation and membrane translocation of c-Src. The oxidative stress-induced decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance, increase in inulin permeability, and redistribution of occludin and ZO-1 from the intercellular junctions were prevented by PP2. The rates of oxidative stress-induced activation of c-Src, tyrosine phosphorylation of ZO-1 and ॆ-catenin, decrease in resistance, increase in permeability to inulin, and redistribution of occludin and ZO-1 were significantly greater in cells transfected with wild type c-Src, whereas it was low in cells transfected with kinase-inactive c-SrcK297R mutant, when compared with those in empty vector-transfected cells. The rates of recovery of resistance, increase in barrier to inulin, and reorganization of occludin and ZO-1 into the intercellular junctions during the calcium-induced reassembly of tight junction were much greater in Caco-2 cells transfected with c-SrcK297R as compared with those in cells transfected with empty vector or wild type c-Src. These results show that the dominant-negative expression of kinase-inactive c-Srcdelays the oxidative stress-induced disruption of tight junction and accelerates calcium-induced assembly of tight junction in Caco-2 cells and demonstrate that oxidative stress-induced disruption of tight junction is mediated by the activation of c-Src.

Three types of transmembrane proteins, occludin, claudins, and junction adhesion molecule, have been identified at the TJ (1Anderson J.M. van Italie C.M. Am. J.

Panzeri C. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. Villa A. Simmons D. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 117-127Google Scholar). The intracellular domains of these transmembrane proteins interact with a number of plaque proteins, which in turn anchors TJ protein complex to the actin cytoskeleton (4Itoh M. Furuse M. Morita K. Kubota K. Saitou M. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1351-1363Google Scholar, 5Wittchen E.S. Haskins J. Stevenson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 49: 35179-35185Google Scholar). Although the specific interactions among TJ proteins are yet to be delineated, there is evidence to support occludin interaction with zonula occludens (ZO)-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3 (5Wittchen E.S.

J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1617-1626Google Scholar). A significant body of evidence indicates that TJ is under dynamic regulation by intracellular signaling molecules. Although only little is known about the specific interactions of signaling molecules with the TJ proteins, a number of signaling molecules, including c-Src, c-Yes, protein kinase C, and G-proteins, appear to be localized at the vicinity of TJ (1Anderson J.M. van Italie C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G467-G475Google Scholar).

Hepatocyte growth factor-mediated disruption of TJ in gastric epithelial and MDCK cell monolayers was associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of ZO-1 (26Hollande F. Blanc E.M. Bali J.P.

Rodriguez-Puyol D. Weber M. Marx M. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 164-173Google Scholar). The role of Src family kinases in oxidative stress-mediated alteration of cell functions was shown in embryonic cells and endothelial cells by using selective inhibitors of Src family kinases (31Abe J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 22048-22055Google Scholar), there is no direct evidence for the oxidative stress-induced activation of c-Src in epithelial tissue and its role in the regulation of TJ. The expression of constitutively active v-Src in MDCK (28Takeda H. Tsukita S. Cell Struct. Funct. 1995; 20: 387-393Google Scholar) and Caco-2 (29Gomez S. del Mont L.M. Verdu J. Roura S. Lloreta J. Fabre M. Garcia D.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1452: 121-132Google Scholar) cells resulted in the disruption of adherens junction with no significant effect on TJ. A recent study suggested that c-Yes may be associated with TJ and play a role in the assembly of TJ in kidney epithelium (22Chen Y.H. Lu Q. Goodenough D.A. Jeansonne B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 13: 1227-1237Google Scholar). Data in the present study demonstrate that c-Src is involved in the de-stabilization of TJ. We transfected Caco-2 cells with empty expression vector, pUSEc-Src (wild type), and pUSEc-SrcK297R (kinase-inactive mutant) to determine the role of c-Src in regulation of the epithelial TJ. We show that 1) oxidative stress induces activation and membrane translocation of c-Src in Caco-2 cells, 2) oxidative stress-induced increase in paracellular permeability is prevented by PP2, the inhibitor of Src family kinases, 3) expression of kinase-inactive c-SrcK297R mutant delays oxidative stress-induced increase in TJ permeability, tyrosine phosphorylation of ZO-1 and ॆ-catenin, and redistribution of occludin and ZO-1, whereas the expression of wild type c-Src induces slight potentiation of the effect of oxidative stress, and 4) expression of c-SrcK297R accelerates the assembly of TJ during the recovery after calcium switch. Cell culture reagents including LipofectAMINE and Geneticin were purchased from Invitrogen. EGTA, xanthine oxidase, xanthine, streptavidin-agarose, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated inulin, protease inhibitors, and protein-A-Sepharose were purchased from Sigma. PP2 (AG1879, 4-amino-5[chlorophenyl]-7-[t-butyl]pyrazolo[3–4-d]pyramidine) was purchased from Calbiochem. All other chemicals were of analytical grade purchased either from Sigma or Fisher. Pre-cast SDS-polyacrylamide gels were purchased from Invitrogen. Mouse monoclonal anti-occludin and rabbit polyclonal anti-occludin and anti-ZO-1 antibodies were purchased fromZymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Biotin-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine, mouse monoclonal anti-ॆ-catenin, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Sigma. Alexa-fluor® 568-conjugated anti-mouse IgGs were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Mouse monoclonal anti-c-Src antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), and rabbit polyclonal anti-c- Src[pY418] antibody was from BioSource (Camarillo, CA). Caco-2 and MDCK cells, purchased from American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, were maintained under standard cell culture conditions at 37 °C in DMEM containing 107 (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Cells were grown on 60-mm plates to 807 confluence were used for transfection with different expression constructs. The empty expression vector, pUSE(−), pUSEc-Src (wild type c-Srcgene), and pUSEc-SrcK297R (kinase-inactive c-Src mutant gene) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. cDNA was inserted as Klenow-treatedNotI-ClaI fragment into the EcoRV site of the pUSE(−) multiple cloning site. The substitution of lysine 297 with arginine in kinase domain abolishes the phosphotransferase activity. Kinase-inactive c-Src serves as a dominant negative and causes cell cycle arrest (36Barone M.V. Courtneidge S.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 509-512Google Scholar). Caco-2 cells at 807 confluence (in 60-mm dishes) were washed with Opti-MEM and LipofectAMINE according to vendor instruction. Five ॖg of pUSE(−), pUSEc-Src, or pUSEc-SrcK297R were preincubated with LipofectAMINE at 25 °C for 20 min and placed onto the cells in a volume of 500 ॖl. After incubation at 37 °C for 3 h (with intermittent rocking every half-hour) regular medium was added. After 96 h of incubation cells were harvested, split into different plates, and grown in the presence of Geneticin (800 ॖg/ml). After 2 weeks, cell colonies were cloned using cloning cylinders. Eight different clones each of Caco-2(EV), Caco-2(WT), and Caco-2(KI) were isolated and subcultured. These subclones were examined under phase contrast microscopy for gross morphology and analyzed for overexpression of c-Src protein by immunoblot analysis. Confluent monolayers of different subclones of Caco-2 cells or MDCK cells were bathed in PBS (Dulbecco's saline containing 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 0.67 bovine serum albumin). Oxidative stress was induced as described previously (19Rao R.K. Basuroy S. Rao V.U. Karnaky K.J. Gupta A. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 471-481Google Scholar) by administering a mixture of xanthine oxidase (20 milliunits/ml) and xanthine (0.5 mm) (XO + X) in the absence or presence of PP2 (10 ॖm). Control cell monolayers received PBS without XO + X. Confluent monolayers of Caco-2(EV), Caco-2(WT), or Caco-2(KI) cells were washed in DMEM and treated with 4 mm EGTA in DMEM for 20 min. EGTA solution was removed, and cell monolayers were washed three times with DMEM. EGTA-treated cell monolayers were then incubated in regular DMEM without EGTA for 6–8 h under standard cell culture conditions. Reassembly of TJ and restoration of barrier function were assessed at varying times by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and inulin flux. TER was measured as described previously (15Rao R.K. Baker R.D. Baker S.S. Gupta A. Holycross M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G812-G823Google Scholar) using a Millicell-ERS Electrical Resistance System (Millipore, Bedford, MA). TER was calculated as ohms/cm2 by multiplying it with the surface area of the monolayer (0.33 cm2). The resistance of the supporting membrane in Transwells (which is usually around 30 ohms/cm2) was subtracted from all readings before calculations. Cell monolayers in Transwells were incubated under different experimental conditions in the presence of 5 ॖg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated inulin in the basal well. At varying times after experimental treatments, 150 ॖl of apical medium and 50 ॖl of basal medium were withdrawn. Fluorescence was measured in a FLX 800 microplate fluorescence reader (BioTEK Instruments Inc, Winooski, VT). The flux into the apical well was calculated as the percent of total inulin administered into the basal well/h/per cm2 of surface area. Under different experimental conditions, Caco-2(EV), Caco-2(WT), and Caco-2(KI) cell monolayers were washed in PBS, fixed in acetone:methanol (1:1), and blocked in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, and 17 bovine serum albumin as described before (19Rao R.K. Basuroy S. Rao V.U. Karnaky K.J. Gupta A. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 471-481Google Scholar). Cell monolayers were incubated with primary antibodies (anti-occludin and anti-ZO-1 antibodies) for 1 h followed by incubation for 1 h with secondary antibodies (Alexa-fluor® 568-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG). The fluorescence was analyzed as described before (19Rao R.K. Basuroy S. Rao V.U. Karnaky K.J. Gupta A. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 471-481Google Scholar) by confocal laser-scanning microscopy (Bio-Rad MRC1024). Images were processed using the software Confocal Assistant 4.02 and Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA). Caco-2(EV), Caco-2(WT), and Caco-2(KI) cell monolayers (in 24-mm Transwells) were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and once with lysis buffer-F (PBS containing 10 mm ॆ-glycerophosphate, 2 ॖg/ml leupeptin, 10 ॖg/ml aprotinin, 10 ॖg/ml bestatin, 10 ॖg/ml pepstatin-A, and 1 mm benzamidine and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were scraped and homogenized as described before (19Rao R.K. Basuroy S. Rao V.U. Karnaky K.J. Gupta A. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 471-481Google Scholar). The plasma membrane pellet was suspended in 500 ॖl of lysis buffer F. Protein was measured by the BCA method (Pierce). Membrane fraction was either mixed with an equal volume of Laemmli sample buffer (2× concentrated) and heated at 100 °C for 5 min or dissolved in lysis buffer N (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 0.27 Nonidet P-40, 0.17 sodium deoxycholate, and a mixture of protease inhibitors as described above for lysis buffer-F) for immunoprecipitation of c-Src. After XO + X treatment, Caco-2(EV), Caco-2(WT), and Caco-2(KI) cell monolayers (24 mm) were washed with ice-cold 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and the proteins were extracted in lysis buffer D (0.37 SDS in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm vanadate and 0.33 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) under denaturing conditions (heating at 100 °C for 5 min). Phosphotyrosine was immunoprecipitated as described before (19Rao R.K. Basuroy S. Rao V.U. Karnaky K.J. Gupta A. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 471-481Google Scholar) using biotin-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Immune complexes were isolated by precipitation using streptavidin-agarose. Immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted for ZO-1 and ॆ-catenin using rabbit polyclonal anti-ZO-1 and mouse monoclonal anti-ॆ-catenin antibodies, respectively. For immune complex c-Src kinase assay, proteins from plasma membrane fraction were extracted under native conditions with lysis buffer N. c-Src was immunoprecipitated by using mouse monoclonal anti c-Src antibodies. Proteins in different samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel (4–127 gradient) electrophoresis and electroblotted into polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were probed for ZO-1, ॆ-catenin, c-Src, or c-Src[pY418] using rabbit polyclonal anti-ZO-1 and anti-c-Src[pY418] and mouse monoclonal anti-c-Src and anti-ॆ-catenin antibodies in combination with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies. Blots were developed using ECL chemiluminescence Kit (Amersham Biosciences. Plasma membrane and soluble fractions or anti-c-Src immune complexes were incubated in an assay mixture containing 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 2 mm MnCl2, 12 mmMgCl2, 0.17 mm ATP, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.17 Triton X-100, 5 ॖg of poly-(Glu-Tyr) peptide substrate, and 1 ॖCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 25 °C for 30 min. After incubation proteins were precipitated with an equal volume of 57 trichloroacetic acid, and a 50-ॖl aliquot of trichloroacetic acid-soluble fraction was blotted on to P81 Whatman filter discs. Discs were washed in 0.57 phosphoric acid. Radioactivity in air-dried discs was counted in a scintillation counter, Beckman LS500TA (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA). Activity was calculated as units of pmol of phosphate incorporated to substrate/h and presented as units/mg of protein in plasma membrane or soluble fractions or protein used for immunoprecipitation of c-Src. Activity present in corresponding immune complexes prepared using pre-immune mouse IgG was subtracted from the activity in anti-c-Src immune complexes. Comparison between two groups was made by the Student's t tests for grouped data. The significance in all tests was derived at the 957 or greater confidence level. The activation of c-Src by oxidative stress in Caco-2 cells was determined by measuring the tyrosine kinase activity, assessing the phosphorylation of c-Src on tyrosine 418, and the translocation of c-Src into plasma membranes. Treatment with XO + X resulted in a rapid increase in overall tyrosine kinase activity in the plasma membrane fraction, which was associated with a decrease in tyrosine kinase activity in the soluble fraction (Fig.1A). Immune complex tyrosine kinase assay showed that the activity of c-Src in the plasma membrane was also rapidly increased by XO + X (Fig. 1B). Immunoprecipitation of phosphotyrosine followed by immunoblot analysis for c-Src showed that XO + X treatment resulted in a rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Src in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 1C). Immunoblot analysis also shows that XO + X induced a rapid increase in the phosphorylation of c-Src on tyrosine 418 (Fig. 1D), whereas the level of total c-Src was unaffected. The level of c-Src in the plasma membrane was rapidly increased by XO + X treatment (Fig.2A), which was associated with a concomitant decrease in c-Src in the soluble fraction. The level of phosphorylation of c-Src on tyrosine 418 was increased in both plasma membrane and soluble fractions (Fig. 2B).Figure 2Activation and membrane translocation of c-Src by oxidative stress. At varying times after treatment with XO + X, plasma membranes (PM) and soluble fractions (SF) were isolated. These fractions were immunoblotted for total c-Src (A) and active c-Src[pY418] (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Our previous studies demonstrated that tyrosine kinase activity plays a role in the oxidative stress-induced increase in TJ permeability (15Rao R.K.

Karnaky K.J. Gupta A. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 471-481Google Scholar). The role of Src family kinase activity in oxidative stress-induced TJ permeability was determined by evaluating the effect of PP2, a selective inhibitor of Src family kinases. Administration of PP2 significantly blocked the XO + X-induced decrease in TER (Fig.3A) and increase in inulin permeability (Fig. 3B). PP2 also prevented XO + X-induced redistribution of occludin and ZO-1 from the intercellular junctions (Fig. 3C). Cell viability was evaluated and compared between groups by several methods, such as lactate dehydrogenase release, DNA fragmentation, trypan blue exclusion, and nuclear staining with propidium iodide. All methods showed that there was less than 0.037 cell death, and these values were similar for non-treated and XO + X-treated cell monolayers. Caco-2 subclones, Caco-2(EV), Caco-2(WT), and Caco-2(KI), expressing the empty vector, wild type c-Src, and kinase-inactive c-SrcK297R mutant, respectively, were isolated. Immunoblot analysis shows an overexpression of c-Src in Caco-2(WT) and Caco-2(KI) cells compared with c-Src expression in Caco-2(EV) cells (Fig. 4A). The gross morphology of these clones in culture was not very different from one another, except that Caco-2(KI) cells grew with slightly greater density (8–127 more cells per unit area) than the others (data not shown). TER tends to be slightly low in Caco-2(WT) cell monolayer and high in Caco-2(KI) cell monolayer compared with the TER in Caco-2(EV) cell monolayer (Fig. 4B). Similarly, inulin permeability tends to be slightly high in Caco-2(WT) cell monolayer and low in Caco-2(KI) cell monolayer compared with that in Caco-2(EV) cell monolayer (Fig. 4C). The differences between Caco-2(WT) and Caco-2(KI) were statistically significant. Four distinct clones each from Caco-2(EV), Caco-2(WT), and Caco-2(KI) were analyzed. Treatment with XO + X resulted in a time-dependent decrease in TER in Caco-2(EV) cell monolayers (Fig. 5A). The rates of decrease in TER by XO + X were significantly low in Caco-2(KI) cell monolayers, whereas those in Caco-2(WT) cell monolayers were greater as compared with Caco-2(EV) cell monolayers. At 1 h of XO + X treatment, the TERs for Caco-2 (EV), Caco-2(WT), and Caco-2(KI) monolayers were 73 ± 5, 38 ± 3, and 108 ± 87 of corresponding basal values, respectively. Similarly, inulin permeability measured at 2 h of oxidative stress was significantly low in Caco-2(KI) cell monolayers, whereas it was greater in Caco-2(WT) cell monolayers as compared with inulin permeability in Caco-2(EV) cell monolayers (Fig. 5B). Immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy showed a co-localization of occludin (Fig.6A) and ZO-1 (Fig.6B) at the intercellular junctions of Caco-2(EV), Caco-2(WT), and Caco-2(KI) cell monolayers. In Caco-2(EV) and Caco-2(WT) cell monolayers treated with XO + X for 3 h, the fluorescence for occludin (Fig. 6A) and ZO-1 (Fig.6B) was found to be low at the intercellular junctions, whereas it was increased in the intracellular compartment. On the other hand, fluorescence for both occludin and ZO-1 remained co-localized at the intercellular junctions of Caco-2(KI) cell monolayers after 3 h of treatment with XO + X. Studies described above show that oxidative stress induces activation and membrane translocation of c-Src in Caco-2 cell monolayers. To determine a similar activation of c-Src in different subclones, plasma membrane and soluble fractions were isolated from the control and the XO + X-treated Caco-2(EV), Caco-2(WT), and Caco-2(KI) cell monolayers. Distribution of total and active c-Src[pY418] in the plasma membrane fraction was determined by immunoblot analysis using anti-Src and anti-Src[pY418] antibodies, respectively. Total amount of c-Src present in plasma membranes was increased by XO + X treatment in all subclones (Fig.7A). Active c-Src was not detectable in the plasma membrane of control cell monolayers, but it was present in XO + X-treated cell monolayers (Fig. 7B). However, the amount of c-Src[pY418] present in the plasma membranes of Caco-2(KI) cells was much less than the amounts of c-Src[pY418] present in the membranes from Caco-2(EV) and Caco-2(WT) cells. We also measured the c-Src kinase activity in the plasma membranes by immune complex tyrosine kinase activity. Very low levels of c-Src kinase activity were detected in the plasma membranes of untreated Caco-2(EV), Caco-2(WT), and Caco-2(KI) cell monolayers, whereas the activity was increased by XO + X treatment (Fig."

Eleven such kinases were recognized in the genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

It was first suggested in 1955 as a way of modulating the enzymatic activity of the glycogen phosphorylase enzyme (1Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 216: 121-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since this discovery, two main superfamilies of protein kinases were identified, one including STPKs1 and PTKs (2Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2252) Google Scholar) and that of His kinases (3Alex L.A. Simon M.I. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 133-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). For a long time, the former were only found in eukaryotes, and the latter were only found in prokaryotes. In this paradigm, proteins from each superfamily were supposed to play analogous roles in the essentially different organization of signal transduction in both phyla. However, in 1978 the phosphorylation of serine/threonine residues in bacteria was demonstrated (4Wang J.Y. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7605-7608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since then several bacterial genes encoding STPKs, PTKs, or their counterpart phosphatases have been identified and cloned (for a review, see Ref.5Bakal C.J. Davies J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 32-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Their existence raises the question of their role in signal transduction pathways, possibly involving complex networks equivalent to those widely studied in eukaryotes (6Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 100: 113-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2231) Google Scholar). Interestingly morphological richness and complicated biochemical differentiation processes, often directed by environmental changes, seem to be common themes in the life cycle of the bacteria possessing more than three genes encoding STPKs (7Ogawara H. Aoyagi N. Watanabe M. Urabe H. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 3343-3352Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has 11 genes encoding putative STPKs (8Cole S.T.

Notably, the pknA and pknB genes are found next to each other in a genomic region that is conserved inM. leprae and also in other Actinomycetales likeStreptomyces coelicolor. This region also includes one gene encoding a putative serine/threonine phosphatase and genes for proteins involved in the cell wall synthesis. These characteristics strongly suggest that this region could actually constitute a functional operon. On the other hand, it is worth noting that the number of two-component systems identified in the M. tuberculosis genome, probably no more than 15 (8), is roughly one-third of that found, for example, in Escherichia coli, a bacterium with a similar genome size. What may be the role of these STPKs and phosphatases in the adaptation of mycobacteria to the intricate interactions that they maintain with their hosts remains an open question. It would also be of great interest to assess whether the two-component systems and the serine/threonine kinases and phosphatases may be interconnected in the regulation of certain functions. PknB is a member of the recently described (14Leonard C.J. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 1038-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) Pkn2 subfamily of STPKs found in prokaryotes. This subfamily shows the highest sequence similarity with the eukaryotic orthologues, and it might have appeared from early horizontal transfer from eukaryotes to bacteria (14Leonard C.J. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 1038-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). PknB is predicted to consist of 626 amino acids with a transmembrane segment dividing the protein into an N-terminal intracellular domain and a C-terminal extracellular domain. The N-terminal domain of PknB includes a kinase domain and juxtamembrane linker of 52 residues. The PknB kinase core retains all the essential amino acids and sequence subdomains (Fig. 1A) that are required for a functional STPK (2Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2252) Google Scholar) despite a modest degree of identity when compared with eukaryotic STPKs (Table I). Actually the full-length PknB protein has been characterized as an active serine/threonine kinase (9Peirs P. De Wit L. Braibant M. Huygen K. Content J. Eur. J.

Open table in a new tab This contribution presents the crystal structure of the recombinant kinase domain of M. tuberculosis PknB in complex with an ATP analog, AMP-PCP, and constitutes the first reported structure of a bacterial STPK. The structure reveals a number of features that explain the intrinsic active state of this construction and suggests an induced fit mode of binding for either the hitherto unknown PknB substrates or other external modulating factor(s). The N-terminal sequence of the pknB gene (Rv0014c) encoding the cytoplasmic domain of the PknB protein (residues 1–331) was initially cloned from the MTCY10H4 cosmid. The digested and purified PCR product was ligated into the T7 RNA polymerase-based pET28 expression vector (Novagen) providing an N-terminal tag of 20 amino acids with a His6 motif. Expression of this construction in E. coli resulted in a highly heterogeneous protein, possibly as a result of variable autophosphorylation events in the juxtamembrane linker (data not shown). Multiple sequence alignment with other members of the protein superfamily and comparative modeling suggested Gly-279 as a probable C terminus of the last α-helix (αI) of the PknB kinase domain. Hence a shorter construct of this domain (residues 1–279) was obtained by the introduction of a stop codon through site-directed mutagenesis. The PknB-(1–279) protein was expressed in E. coliBL21(DE3). Bacteria were grown at 37 °C until late log phase in LB medium supplemented with kanamycin (30 μg/ml) and induced for 12–16 h at 15 °C by addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The bacterial pellet was resuspended and sonified in 50 mmHepes buffer, pH 7, 0.2 m NaCl including protease inhibitors. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation (20,000 ×g for 1 h). The supernatant containing soluble proteins was applied to Ni2+-loaded HiTrap chelating columns (Amersham Biosciences) using an fast protein liquid chromatography system and eluted through an imidazole gradient (0–0.5 m). A further step of gel filtration in a Superdex 75 column was performed to separate the monomeric protein from aggregated material. The protein was subsequently concentrated by means of Macro- and Microsep concentrators (Pall/Gellman) up to a concentration of ∼10 mg/ml. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Purity of the samples was checked by SDS-PAGE. One unit of the enzyme control PKA (New England Biolabs) or 1 μm purified PknB was incubated with 10 μm myelin basic protein (Invitrogen) as model substrate. The assays were carried out in 20 μl of PKA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2) or PknB buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij35, 2 mmMnCl2) plus 0.5 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences). Various concentrations of staurosporine (Sigma) up to 10 μm were added to test its inhibitory effect. The reaction was conducted for 30 min at room temperature and stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer plus EDTA (25 mmfinal concentration). Ten microliters of the reaction were subjected to electrophoresis. The reaction products were separated on an SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel, and the radiolabeled myelin basic protein was visualized after autoradiography of the dried gel. Hanging droplets containing 1 μl of protein at 5 mg/ml and 1 μl of buffer (0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.5, 30 mm MgCl2, 150 μmAMP-PCP, 27% polyethylene glycol 400, 4% 1,3-butanediol) were equilibrated at 19 °C in Limbro plates against 1 ml of the same buffer but without the nucleotide and the butanediol. Diamond-like plates of 0.2–0.4 × 0.05–0.1 mm showed up after 2–3 weeks depending on preparation batches. X-ray diffraction data sets (Table II) were collected from vitrified crystals at 100 K using synchrotron radiation at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) beamline ID14.2, indexed and integrated using MOSFLM (15Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 ESF-EACBM Newsl. Protein Crystallogr. 1992; : 26Google Scholar), and reduced with SCALA (16Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). All crystals had C2221 symmetry with cell constantsa = 114.5 Å, b = 122.0 Å,c = 47.0 Å. The structure was solved by the molecular replacement method using AMoRe (17Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5026) Google Scholar) with coordinates of a polyserine model derived from the crystal structure of rabbit phosphorylase kinase (Protein Data Bank code 1PHK). An R-factor of 49.4% (for the 12–4.5-Å resolution range) was calculated for the solution. Simulated annealing using the program CNS (18Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

J. Mol. Graph. 1992; 10: 44-46Crossref Google Scholar), was possible. At this point the maps showed unambiguous density for the nucleotide. Further refinement was carried out using REFMAC (16Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). The final model displays anR-factor of 19.1% and Rfree of 23.0% and includes residues 3–163 and 180–278, the AMP-PCP nucleotide, two magnesium cations, and 85 water molecules (TableII). There is no supporting electron density, and hence no coordinates have been provided, for the His tag residues and for 16 residues (164–179) comprised in the so-called activation and “P + 1” loops.Table IICrystallographic statisticsData collectionSpace groupWavelength (Å)Resolution2-aNumbers in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shell.Completeness2-aNumbers in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shell.(%)Multiplicity2-aNumbers in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shell.Rmeas2-aNumbers in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shell.,2-bRmeas = {Σh(√{nh/(nh− 1)}) Σj‖Îh−Ih,j‖}/Σh,jIh,jwith Îh = (ΣjIh,j)/nhand where nh is the multiplicity of reflectionh.C22210.93361.0–2.2 (2.32–2.20)99.8 (99.8)8.0 (8.1)0.09 (0.64)RefinementUnique reflections2-cNumber of unique reflections in a test set of reflections not used in the refinement is shown in parentheses.R-factor2-dR-factor = Σhkl‖‖Fo‖ −k‖Fc‖‖/Σhkl‖Fo‖;Rfree: same for the test set.Rfree2-dR-factor = Σhkl‖‖Fo‖ −k‖Fc‖‖/Σhkl‖Fo‖;Rfree: same for the test set.Number of refined atomsr.m.s.d.2-eRoot mean square deviations.ProteinNucleotideSolventBonds (Å)Angles (°)16,292 (848)0.19090.2303195331870.0171.6232-a Numbers in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shell.2-b Rmeas = {Σh(√{nh/(nh− 1)}) Σj‖Îh−Ih,j‖}/Σh,jIh,jwith Îh = (ΣjIh,j)/nhand where nh is the multiplicity of reflectionh.2-c Number of unique reflections in a test set of reflections not used in the refinement is shown in parentheses.2-d R-factor = Σhkl‖‖Fo‖ −k‖Fc‖‖/Σhkl‖Fo‖;Rfree: same for the test set.2-e Root mean square deviations. Open table in a new tab The structure of the catalytic domain ofM. tuberculosis PknB was solved by molecular replacement and refined at 2.2-Å resolution (Table II). The final model accounts for 260 of 278 residues and displays good main-chain stereochemical parameters for all but one amino acid, Ala-44 (see below). The overall fold of the catalytic domain of PknB is similar (Fig. 1, B and C, and Table I) to that of the eukaryotic protein kinases and consists of two lobes: an N-terminal subdomain, including a curled β-sheet and a long α-helix (αC), and a C-terminal lobe, essentially composed by α-helices (for a review, see Ref. 20Huse M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2002; 109: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). Protein kinases can be found in two conformational states referred to as “open” and “closed” conformations (21Cox S. Radzio-Andzelm E. Taylor S.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) depending on relative orientation between both lobes. With some variations, the closed conformation correlates with the active state of these enzymes. The movements that bring one conformation into the other involve two main hinge points, one in the Gly-rich loop and the other in the link region between the two lobes (Fig. 1B). In the structure that we report here, the catalytic domain of PknB adopts an overall closed conformation with the nucleotide tightly bound in the deep cleft between the N-terminal and the C-terminal lobes (Fig.1B). This is in contrast with PKA (22Taylor S.S. Radzio-Andzelm E. Madhusudan Cheng X. Ten Eyck L.F. Narayana N. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which was found in the closed conformation only for the ternary (enzyme-nucleotide-substrate) complex but in agreement with what has been observed for the binary enzyme-nucleotide complex of PhK (Ref.23Owen D.J. Noble M.E. Garman E.F. Papageorgiou A.C. Johnson L.N. Structure. 1995; 3: 467-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar and see Fig. 1C). One of the characteristics that define the closed conformation of a protein kinase is the relative orientation of its αC helix. In the closed state, the position of this helix is such that it allows a crucial contact to be established between a lysine residue in the β3 strand and a glutamic acid in the αC helix. As a result, the lysine is appropriately oriented to position the α- and β-phosphates of the nucleotide for catalysis. Fig. 1Cshows that the N terminus of the αC helix of both PknB and PhK does not match the position of the same region in PKA. However, PknB Lys-40 (PKA Lys-72) is hydrogen-bonded to Glu-59 (PKA Glu-91), and the lysine does interact with the α- and β-phosphates of the nucleotide. Therefore, as for PhK, the orientation of PknB αC helix can be described as corresponding to a closed conformation of the enzyme. In the crystal structure of the unphosphorylated form of the D1161A mutant of IRK (24Till J.H. Ablooglu A.J. Frankel M. Bishop S.M. Kohanski R.A. Hubbard S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10049-10055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) the enzyme is in an overall closed conformation, but the spatial disposition of the αC helix prevents the Lys-Glu contact. The authors (24Till J.H. Ablooglu A.J. Frankel M. Bishop S.M. Kohanski R.A. Hubbard S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10049-10055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) propose that the phenylalanine in the Asp-Phe-Gly motif (residues 156–158 in PknB) of the magnesium-positioning loop (Fig. 1, A and B) is responsible for either allowing or blocking the movement that brings the αC helix to its active position. In PknB, this phenylalanine is in a conformation similar to that found in PKA and, as stated above, allows the Lys-Glu contact even if the αC helix disposition is not the same as that observed in PKA (Fig. 1C). Maintaining the active conformation of the αC helix in PknB may be at the cost of some strain and disorder at its N terminus, namely in the loop that connects it to the β3 strand. This could explain the abnormal (φ,ψ) angles of the Ala-44 amino acid and the poor density observed in the side chain of Arg-48 (Fig. 2). There is another difference in the N-terminal lobe between PknB and both PhK and PKA. It results from the insertion in PknB of four amino acids between the β4 and β5 strands (Fig. 1). This makes the PknB N-terminal β-sheet more curled than in other kinases, a feature that might be important for the interaction of PknB with other factors or with its own juxtamembrane linker. Finally it is worth mentioning that Arg-101, a residue in the hinge region between the lobes, occludes part of the groove that, in PKA, is filled by the peptide substrate. This is suggestive of a particular mode of substrate recognition and may be of great interest in the design of PknB inhibitors. The Gly-rich motif in the N-terminal lobe of STPKs and PTKs acts as a flap that either prevents the binding of or firmly covers the nucleotide (25Bossemeyer D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 201-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Like PhK, PknB differs from the consensus sequence of this motif (GX1GX2φGX3V) in that the third glycine is replaced with a serine (Fig.1A). Moreover, a methionine residue, instead of the usual tyrosine or phenylalanine, occupies the hydrophobic φ position. Nevertheless, variations in this motif are not uncommon and may play a functional role. Interestingly PknB has a glycine at theX2 position, which gives increased flexibility to the external lip of the flap. This may facilitate a closer packing of the nucleotide γ-phosphate compared with the structure of other kinases poised for phosphorylation such as PKA (Refs. 26Zheng J. Knighton D.R. Ten Eyck L.F. Karlsson R. Xuong N. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2154-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar and 27Bossemeyer D. Engh R.A. Kinzel V. Ponstingl H. Huber R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, and see Fig. 3). Thus, the main-chain amides of Gly-21, Met-22, and Ser-23 bind only the γ-phosphoryl group (Fig.3B) and not the β- and γ-phosphates as in the closed conformation of PKA (26Zheng J. Knighton D.R. Ten Eyck L.F. Karlsson R. Xuong N. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2154-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 27Bossemeyer D. Engh R.A. Kinzel V. Ponstingl H. Huber R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The adenine moiety is buried in a hydrophobic pocket (Fig.3A) and makes two hydrogen bonds with the enzyme: its N-6 position binds the main-chain oxygen of Glu-93, and the N-1 atom binds the amide of Val-91. The ribose is more loosely bound to the enzyme than in PKA or PhK: its O-3* position binds the backbone carboxyl of Ala-142, but the O-2* atom is not in direct contact with the protein. The nucleotide is in the anti conformation (χ = −154°), and the ribose bears a C3′-endopuckering. As mentioned above, an important difference between PknB and other kinases co-crystallized with nucleotide triphosphates involves the position of the γ-phosphate. Whereas the angle displayed by the three phosphates in PKA (Protein Data Bank code 1ATP) is 105°, it is 162° in PknB, resulting in an almost linear triphosphoryl group. Two metal ions, identified as magnesium and displaying well defined octahedral coordination spheres, are found in the structure of PknB (Fig. 3). In PKA, a “primary” activating cation binds the β- and γ-phosphates as well as Asp-184. In PknB, the equivalent magnesium is shifted 2.5 Å toward the small lobe, consistent with the new location of the γ-phosphate, and binds the same phosphoryl groups but not Asp-156 (PKA Asp-184). On the other hand, in PKA a “secondary” cation binds more weakly the α- and γ-phosphates as well as Asn-171 (26Zheng J. Knighton D.R. Ten Eyck L.F. Karlsson R. Xuong N. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2154-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), and in some structures, it also binds Asp-184 (27Bossemeyer D. Engh R.A. Kinzel V. Ponstingl H. Huber R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). This second metal ion has an inhibitory role, probably by slowing down the release of the ADP product, which is the rate-limiting step in the kinase reaction. One magnesium ion occupies the same location in PknB, but it coordinates the α- and β-phosphates and both Asn-143 (PKA Asn-171) and Asp-156. When the structure of PknB is superposed onto the active (closed) conformation of PKA it becomes apparent that all the amino acids in the active site are correctly positioned to phosphorylate a putative substrate (Fig.4). Thus, the backbone oxygen of Asp-138 makes a hydrogen bond with the amide nitrogen of Asn-143. This interaction places Asp-138 in a suitable position to orientate an attacking hydroxyl from a putative substrate. Another important residue for maintaining the active conformation of the catalytic loop (residues 135–143) is Asp-198. This amino acid is hydrogen-bonded to the backbone amide groups of His-136 and Arg-137 and to the Nε2 of His-130, thus becoming a central pivot in this delicate network of interactions (Fig. 4). However, the nucleotide γ-phosphate (Fig. 4) is far from Asp-138 (PKA Asp-166), the proposed (although controversial) catalytic base (28Zhou J. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2977-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and from Lys-140 (PKA Lys-68), a residue highly conserved among STPKs but not in PTKs. Possibly due to the lack of interaction with the γ-phosphate, the Nζ atom of Lys-140 is disordered in this PknB structure. The activation loop of protein kinases (residues 164–177 in PknB) encompasses the region between the β9 strand, just next to the magnesium-positioning loop, and the P + 1 loop (see below). The activation loop can undergo large conformational changes (29Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar) that may determine the catalytic state of the enzyme. Fourteen residues in the activation loop of PknB, from Ala-164 to Ile-177, are not visible in this structure and hence are presumably disordered. The so-called P + 1 loop (PknB residues 178–183) follows the C terminus of the activation loop and helps to accommodate the P + 1 substrate residue. It is thought to play a major role in the discrimination between serine/threonine and tyrosine amino acids since it governs the distance between the substrate backbone and the active site (30Taylor S.S. Radzio-Andzelm E. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1255-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 31Johnson L.N. Lowe E.D. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). As expected for an STPK (31Johnson L.N. Lowe E.D. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), this loop contains a threonine, Thr-179, rather than the proline found at this position in PTKs. The first two residues of the P + 1 loop (Gly-178 and Thr-179) are disordered in the PknB structure. The deviation of the γ-phosphate position toward the N-terminal lobe observed in PknB is new, albeit diversity in the position of this phosphate has been described for other kinases. For instance, in the ternary complex of IRK (Protein Data Bank code1IR3) this phosphate, and to a lesser extent the β-phosphate, protrudes out of the cleft, lying 5 Å away from the putative attacking hydroxyl. The most interesting trait in the interaction between PknB and the nucleotide is that the active site amino acids of the enzyme appear to be ready for phosphotransfer, but the γ-phosphate of the nucleotide is far from its functional place (Fig. 4). This differs from other binary nucleotide-kinase complexes (31Johnson L.N. Lowe E.D. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), namely cyclin-dependent kinase 2, hematopoietic cell kinase, mitogen-"

Two types of SOC channels have been described so far, which have distinct biophysical properties, but are activated under the same conditions, by depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores with agonists, inhibitors of sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) and/or strong Ca2+chelators. First, Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+-selective (CRAC)1 channels have been found (4Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Google Scholar) and extensively described on the level of whole-cell current in a variety of nonexcitable cells, including Jurkat T-lymphocytes and RBL cells (Refs. 5Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6295-6299Google Scholar, 6Lewis R.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 497-521Google Scholar, 7Parekh A.B. Penner R. J. Physiol.

Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Google Scholar). Second, nonselective SOC channels of small, but resolvable 3 pS conductance has been found and described on single channel and whole-cell current levels by us (10Trepakova E.S. Gericke M. Hirakawa Y.

Despite a great physiological importance of both types of SOC channels, the molecular mechanism of their activation is still unresolved. In reviewing Ca2+-independent processes that can be activated by the depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores in the presence of strong Ca2+ chelators, the Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2(iPLA2) attracted our attention as it is activated under the same conditions as those known to trigger activation of SOC channels and CCE. Indeed, it has been recently shown that iPLA2 can be activated by depletion of Ca2+stores (19Wolf M.J. Wang J. Turk J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1522-1526Google Scholar, 20Nowatzke W. Ramanadham S. Ma Z. Hsu F.F. Bohrer A. Turk J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4073-4085Google Scholar) caused by vasopressin, as well as by thapsigargin (TG, an inhibitor of SERCA (21Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Google Scholar)), both in the presence and absence of intracellular BAPTA (19Wolf M.J. Wang J. Turk J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1522-1526Google Scholar). In the field of store-operated channels iPLA2 has not yet been considered as a potentially important element in signal transduction, but a significant role of iPLA2 in remodeling of cellular phospholipids (22Balsinde J. Bianco I.D. Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8527-8531Google Scholar, 23Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16069-16072Google Scholar), and growing evidence of its involvement in a variety of agonist-triggered signaling cascades (see Ref. 24Winstead M.V. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 28-39Google Scholar for review) suggests that it may be a multifaceted enzyme, with multiple physiologically important functions in numerous cell types and tissues. In this study we sought to determine whether iPLA2 could be involved in activation of SOC channels and CCE, and we obtained very intriguing and largely unexpected results. Here we provide the first experimental evidence that iPLA2 is a crucial molecular determinant in activation of SOC channels and capacitative Ca2+ influx in a variety of cell types, including SMC, platelets, Jurkat T-lymphocytes, and RBL cells. Primary culture SMC from mouse (mSMC) and rabbit (rSMC) aorta were prepared as described previously (10Trepakova E.S. Gericke M. Hirakawa Y. Weisbrod R.M. Cohen R.A. Bolotina V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7782-7790Google Scholar, 25Cohen R.A. Weisbrod R.M. Gericke M. Yaghoubi M. Bierl C. Bolotina V.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 210-219Google Scholar). Human platelets were prepared from the platelet-rich plasma as described previously (26Trepakova E.S. Cohen R.A. Bolotina V.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 201-209Google Scholar). Jurkat T-lymphocytes and RBL cell lines were kept in culture using standard technique. Single channel currents were recorded in mSMC in cell-attached or inside-out configuration using an Axopatch 200B amplifier as described previously (10Trepakova E.S. Gericke M. Hirakawa Y. Weisbrod R.M. Cohen R.A. Bolotina V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7782-7790Google Scholar). Pipettes with tip resistance of 10–20 MΩ were coated with Sylgard. Data were digitized at 5 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz. Representative single channel current traces were additionally filtered at 500 Hz for better visual resolution of small conductance (3 pS) channels. Open channel probability (NPo) was analyzed and plotted over time to illustrate the time course of the activity of all 3-pS channels present in membrane patch. Single channel currents were recorded at +100 mV applied to the membrane (−100 applied to the pipette), and upward current deflections represent channel openings in all the representative traces. The recording time was limited by the lifetime of the patch, which usually lasted only 5–10 min. Previously we have shown (10Trepakova E.S. Gericke M. Hirakawa Y. Weisbrod R.M. Cohen R.A. Bolotina V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7782-7790Google Scholar) that native 3-pS SOC channels are the same in mSMC and rSMC. They conduct equally well Na+, Ca2+, and Mn2+, so in patch clamp studies Na+ was used as charge carrier, and pipette and bath solutions had the same composition (in mm): 140 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 TEA, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4). Experiments were done at 20–22 °C. Whole-cell currents were recorded in RBL cells using standard whole-cell (dialysis) patch clamp technique. An Axopatch 200B amplifier was used; data were digitized at 5 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz. Pipettes were used with tip resistance of 2–4 MΩ. After breaking into the cell, holding potential was 0 mV, and ramp depolarizations (from −100 to +100 mV, 200 ms) were applied every 5 s. The time course of CRAC current development was analyzed at −80 mV in each cell (amplitude was expressed in pA/pF). The maximum current density (in pA/pF) at −80 mV was determined after 10 min of cell dialysis and summarized for all the cells tested (with S.E. shown in the figures). Representative I/V relationships are shown during ramp depolarization after 10 min of cell dialysis. Passive leakage current with zero reversal potential (at the moment of breaking into the cell) was subtracted (it was usually higher in cells pretreated with BEL for 30 min and did not change over time). Intracellular (pipette) solution contained (in mm): 145 cesium glutamate, 3 MgCl2, 10 BAPTA, 5 TEA, 10 HEPES (pH 7.2). Extracellular solution was (in mm): 20 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 130 NaCl, 3 CsCl, 5 HEPES (pH 7.4). In some experiments BEL (20 ॖm) was added to the pipette solution. Experiments were done at 20–22 °C. SMC, platelets, and Jurkat cells were loaded with fura-2AM, and quantitative changes in intracellular Ca2+ (fura-2,F340/F380) were monitored as described previously (10Trepakova E.S. Gericke M. Hirakawa Y. Weisbrod R.M. Cohen R.A. Bolotina V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7782-7790Google Scholar, 11Trepakova E.S. Bolotina V.M. Membr. Cell Biol. 2002; 19: 49-56Google Scholar, 25Cohen R.A. Weisbrod R.M. Gericke M. Yaghoubi M. Bierl C. Bolotina V.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 210-219Google Scholar). For summary data, Δratio was calculated as the difference between the peak ratio after extracellular Ca2+ was added, and its level right before Ca2+addition. The summary data are shown without subtraction of the basal Ca2+ influx that was negligible (0.20 ± 0.01,n = 115). Dual-excitation fluorescence imaging system (IonOptics) was used for studies of individual SMC, while standard spectrofluorimeter (Hitachi F-4500) was used for the recording of total fluorescence from either confluent SMC on coverslips or platelets and Jurkat cells in suspension. Data were summarized either from the large number of individual SMC cells (tested in at least three different experiments/preparations) or from at least five different experiments when total fluorescence from confluent cells or cells in suspension was recorded. The rate of Mn2+influx-induced fura-2 quenching was used to estimate divalent cation influx into SMC, as we described previously (25Cohen R.A. Weisbrod R.M. Gericke M. Yaghoubi M. Bierl C. Bolotina V.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 210-219Google Scholar). The rate of influx was estimated from the slope during the first 20 s after Mn2+ (100 ॖm addition). The summary data are shown without subtraction of the basal influx that was negligible (0.09 ± 0.02, n = 15). Membrane proteins were extracted from cultured rSMC collected from P100 dish in Tris buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl (pH = 7.5)) with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, 10 ॖg/ml aprotinin, 10 ॖg/ml leupeptin, 10 ॖg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm EDTA), then sonicated four times for 10 s with 15-s breaks between cycles, spun down at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected for further centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The pellet was re-suspended in the Tris buffer (with protease inhibitors). The amount of protein in membrane fractions was determined, and the samples were aliquoted (50 ॖg each), frozen, and stored at −80 °C until later use. Western blots were done using standard methods: samples were loaded on a 7.57 SDS-polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 207 methanol) at 40 V overnight. The membrane was then blocked in PBST (PBS containing 0.057 Tween 20) with 37 milk for 30 min and then incubated with primary (anti-iPLA2) antibody in the same buffer for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG) for 1 h in PBST with 37 milk. The signal was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent (Pierce) and exposure to X-Omat films. Polyclonal antibody directed against a unique domain in the iPLA2A isoform (Cayman Chemicals) was used to confirm protein expression in plasma membrane fraction from rSMC and mSMC. A 20-base-long antisense corresponding to the conserved nucleotides 59–78 in iPLA2A sequence was utilized (ASGVI-18; 5′-fluorescein-CTCCTTCACCCGGAATGGGT-3′) (27Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29317-29321Google Scholar). As a control, the sense compliment of ASGVI-18 was used (SGV-18; 5′-fluorescein-ACCCATTCCGGGTGAAGGAG-3′). Both ASGVI-18 and SGVI-18 contained phosphorothioate linkages to limit their degradation and were labeled with fluorescein, and its presence in the cells was verified by imaging (excitation at 480 nm, emission at 515 nm) before the experiments. rSMC were transfected on days 6–7 (60–707 confluence) using Lipofectamine plus (Invitrogen) and following the standard protocols. The transfection rate was more than 707 in SMC. The activity of iPLA2 was determined using the following assay. Briefly, after specific treatments (as described under 舠Results舡) rSMC and RBL cells were collected (using rubber policeman to lift them up), sonicated, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and kept on ice. The amount of protein was determined, and the assay was performed the same day using a modified kit originally designed for cPLA2(cPLA2 assay kit, Cayman Chemicals). To detect the activity of iPLA2 and not cPLA2, the phospholipase activity was assayed by incubating the samples with the substrate, arachidonoyl thio-PC (1-hexadecyl-2-arachidonylthio-2-deoxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) for 1 h at 20 °C in a modified Ca2+-free buffer of the following composition (in mm): 4 EGTA, 160 HEPES (pH 7.4), 300 NaCl, 8 Triton X-100, 607 glycerol, and 2 mg/ml of BSA. The reaction was stopped by addition of 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) for 5 min, and the absorbance was determined at 405 nm using a standard plate reader. The activity of iPLA2 was expressed in units = absorbance/mg of protein. BEL (or HELSS) was purchased from Calbiochem and Sigma. The iPLA2 polyclonal antiserum was from Cayman Chemicals. The iPLA2A sense and antisense oligonucleotides were from Sigma. All other drugs were from Sigma. Please, notice that inhibition of iPLA2 with BEL is irreversible, requires basal activity of this enzyme, and strongly depends on temperature, time of treatment, and concentration used. When applied to the intact cells it also needs time to permeate into the cell. In most cell types the optimal conditions for BEL treatment (to ensure complete inhibition of iPLA2) are the following: intact cells need to be pretreated (in bath solution not containing BSA or serum) with 20–100 ॖm BEL for 30 min at 37–40 °C, and then BEL can be washed away before the beginning of the experiments. Group data are presented as mean ± S.E. Single or paired Student's t test was used to determine the statistical significance of the obtained data. The significance between multiple groups was evaluated using analysis of variance. The difference was considered significant atp < 0.05 and is marked by * in the figures. First, we confirmed that iPLA2 is present and functionally active in aortic SMC. Fig.1A shows that iPLA2A isoform can indeed be detected in both rabbit (rSMC) and mouse (mSMC) aortic SMC by Western blotting with a specific polyclonal antibody. Next we tested whether depletion of Ca2+ stores increases the activity of iPLA2. To effectively deplete Ca2+ stores, we used a combined BAPTA and TG treatment. rSMC were first loaded with BAPTA-AM (20 ॖm for 20 min, which we have previously shown to effectively buffer intracellular Ca2+ in these cells (28Hirakawa Y. Gericke M. Cohen R.A. Bolotina V.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1732-H1744Google Scholar)), and then TG (5 ॖm) was applied for 10 min. After this treatment, we found the activity of iPLA2 to increase 2.6-fold in comparison with basal level in untreated cells (Fig.1B), which confirmed that depletion of Ca2+stores causes activation of iPLA2. To test the potential role of iPLA2 in activation of store-operated channels and CCE pathway in SMC, two independent approaches (molecular and pharmacological) were used. First, rSMC were transfected with antisense or sense oligonucleotides (labeled with fluorescin) that were specifically designed for the iPLA2A isoforms (27Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29317-29321Google Scholar). As expected, antisense decreased the level of the iPLA2A protein expression, which we measured 36 h after transfection (Fig. 1D). Importantly, transfection of rSMC with antisense prevented activation of iPLA2 by depletion of Ca2+ stores; TG/BAPTA treatment caused a significant increase in iPLA2 activity in rSMC transfected with sense, but not antisense oligonucleotides (Fig. 1E). At the same time, transfection of rSMC with antisense, but not sense, oligonucleotides for iPLA2A significantly reduced TG-induced Ca2+ influx (Fig.2, A and B). TG-induced Mn2+ influx (Fig. 2, C andD), which is considered a more direct measure of ion channel-mediated cation influx in intact cells, was also inhibited in rSMC treated with antisense, but not sense, oligonucleotides. These results for the first time demonstrated that activation of CCE in SMC is dependent on the functional expression of iPLA2. To obtain additional and independent evidence that can confirm the central role of iPLA2 in activation of CCE, we tested whether mechanism-based inhibition of iPLA2 enzymatic activity could mimic the effects of iPLA2 antisense transfection. BEL, a suicidal substrate for iPLA2, is widely used as an irreversible mechanism-based (time- and temperature-dependent) inhibitor with a specificity ∼1,000 times higher for iPLA2 over other PLA2isoforms (24Winstead M.V. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 28-39Google Scholar, 29Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 445-450Google Scholar). When applied to the intact cells for 30 min at 37–40 °C, 20–100 ॖm BEL is known to completely inhibit iPLA2 activity (EC50 = 7 ॖm) (22Balsinde J. Bianco I.D. Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8527-8531Google Scholar), and it is considered to be the most specific inhibitor of iPLA2-dependent processes in a variety of cell types. In SMC, we confirmed that pretreatment with BEL (25 ॖm for 30 min at 37 °C followed by 20 min washing prior to the experiments) prevented activation of iPLA2 by depletion of Ca2+ stores (Fig. 1B) and used BEL as an additional tool to study the role of iPLA2 in activation of CCE. Fig. 3 shows the examples of TG-induced 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB)-sensitive Ca2+ (Fig. 3A) and Mn2+ (Fig.3C) influx in single rSMC. Pretreatment of rSMC with BEL (25 ॖm for 15–30 min at 37 °C followed by a 10–30-min wash) significantly inhibited both, TG-induced Ca2+ (Fig. 3, A and B) and Mn2+ influx (Fig. 2, C and D), which was identical to the effects of rSMC transfection with iPLA2 antisense (Fig. 2, A–D). Thus, inhibition of iPLA2 with BEL mimicked the effects of SMC transfection with specific antisense to iPLA2. Identical effects of the molecular and pharmacological inhibition of iPLA2 on CCE not only established the crucial role of iPLA2 in this process, but also confirmed the use of BEL as a tool for functional inhibition of iPLA2 in our further studies of iPLA2-dependent activation of SOC channels. The effect of BEL on capacitative Ca2+ influx was dose-dependent. Fig.4A shows that pretreatment of rSMC with 10–25 ॖm BEL (for 30 min at 37 °C) produced significant inhibition of TG-induced Ca2+ influx. The same inhibitory effect was also observed in mSMC in which BEL (25 ॖm) reduced TG-induced Ca2+ influx from Δr = 2.0 ± 0.2 (n = 20) in control cells to 0.3 ± 0.1 (n = 15). It is important that the effect of BEL was irreversible and specific to Ca2+ influx. BEL did not affect TG-induced Ca2+release from the stores (Fig. 4A), as indicated by similar increases in intracellular Ca2+ (recorded in the absence of extracellular Ca2+) in control and BEL-treated cells. Similarly, BEL-induced inhibition of TG-induced Ca2+influx, but not Ca2+ release, was also observed in human platelets (Fig. 4B), which are known to have store-operated cation influx that is similar to SMC (11Trepakova E.S. Bolotina V.M. Membr. Cell Biol. 2002; 19: 49-56Google Scholar, 26Trepakova E.S. Cohen R.A. Bolotina V.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 201-209Google Scholar, 30Sargeant P. Sage S.O. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 64: 395-443Google Scholar, 31Diver J.M. Sage S.O. Rosado J.A. Cell Calcium. 2001; 30: 323-329Google Scholar). To eliminate the potential role of magnesium-dependent phosphatidate phosphohydrolase (PAP-1) (32Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31937-31941Google Scholar) in the effect of BEL on CCE, propranolol (50–100 ॖm for 30 min, which is widely used to inhibit PAP-1 (33Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7684-7690Google Scholar), but not iPLA2) was tested. Propranolol did not inhibit TG-induced Ca2+ influx in both SMC (Fig.4A) and human platelets (Fig. 4B), which confirmed that BEL-induced inhibition of CCE is mediated by iPLA2 and not PAP-1. To confirm that the BEL-induced inhibition of Ca2+ and Mn2+ influx indeed resulted from inability of SOC channels to get activated by TG, single SOC channels were recorded in cell-attached membrane patches. Fig. 4C shows that treatment of control SMC with TG (1 ॖm for 10–20 min) resulted in activation of specific 3-pS nonselective cation SOC channels (described previously in detail (10Trepakova E.S. Gericke M. Hirakawa Y. Weisbrod R.M. Cohen R.A. Bolotina V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7782-7790Google Scholar)), which could be recorded in cell-attached membrane patches (in six out of seven experiments). Consistent with Ca2+ and Mn2+ influx studies, TG failed to activate single SOC channels (Fig. 4D) in SMC in which iPLA2 was inhibited with BEL (five out of five experiments). Rare (1–2/min) openings of 3-pS channels (similar to what is observed in normal resting SMC (10Trepakova E.S. Gericke M. Hirakawa Y. Weisbrod R.M. Cohen R.A. Bolotina V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7782-7790Google Scholar)) could still be detected in cell-attached membrane patches from BEL-pretreated SMC (Fig.4D), suggesting that BEL does not affect the presence of SOC channels, but inhibits their TG-induced activation. Control experiments showed that BEL pretreatment did not affect the activity of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and Ca2+-dependent K+ channels in SMC (data not shown), indicating specificity of BEL-induced inhibition of iPLA2 on activation of SOC channels. To determine whether the role of iPLA2 in CCE is specific for vascular SMC in which capacitative Ca2+ influx is known to be mediated by nonselective cation channels (10Trepakova E.S. Gericke M.

Pharmacol. 2002; 135: 1-13Google Scholar), or may be a general phenomenon, we also tested the effects of iPLA2inhibition by BEL in Jurkat T-lymphocytes and in RBL cells. In these cells CCE is known to be mediated by highly Ca2+-selective CRAC channels (5Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6295-6299Google Scholar, 6Lewis R.S. Annu. Rev.

Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Google Scholar) distinct from nonselective SOC channels in SMC, but may be guided by the same store-dependent mechanism. Fig.5, A and B, show that in Jurkat cells inhibition of iPLA2 with BEL impaired TG-induced Ca2+ influx, but did not affect Ca2+release, which was identical to SMC and human platelets (Fig. 4,A and B). To further confirm that iPLA2 is involved in store-dependent activation of CRAC channels, we tested the effect of BEL-induced inhibition of iPLA2 on the whole-cell CRAC current that develops during cell dialysis with BAPTA in RBL cells. Similar to SMC, pretreatment of intact RBL cells with BEL (25 ॖm for 30 min at 37 °C) prevented activation of iPLA2 upon depletion of Ca2+ stores with TG (Fig. 1C). Fig. 6,A and B, show the time courses of the development of CRAC current (at −80 mV) and correspondingI/V relationships in representative control RBL cells and in cells pretreated with BEL (30 ॖm for 30 min at 37 °C). In all nine control cells tested, a typical CRAC current developed reaching −2.00 ± 0.15 pA/pF (n = 9) after 10 min of cell dialysis with BAPTA. Contrary to control, in seven out of nine cells pretreated with BEL, activation of CRAC channels was dramatically impaired, and CRAC current was hardly distinguishable (−0.32 ± 0.14 pA/pF, n = 7). We also tested the effects of acute intracellular application of BEL on the whole-cell CRAC current during cell dialysis (by including BEL into the patch pipette). In these experiments we could not expect to achieve complete inhibition of iPLA2 in all the cells tested. Indeed, BEL is known to be a mechanism-based inhibitor that is effective at physiological temperature (37–40 °C) when iPLA2 is normally functional. At room temperature (20–22 °C, when enzymatic activity of iPLA2 is significantly slow), higher concentrations and longer treatment could be required for the mechanism based suicidal substrates to effectively inhibit the enzyme activity. Thus, during patch clamp experiments, when BEL was included in the patch pipette and applied inside the cell during its dialysis, we could not expect reliable inhibition of iPLA2 in all the cells during a short 10–15-min recording of CRAC current at room temperature (20–22 °C), which were the time and temperature limitations in our patch clamp experiments. Under such nonoptimal condition (low temperature and short time) one could expect that the effect of BEL may vary from cell to cell, ranging from full inhibition of CRAC current to no effect. The results of the experiments (Fig. 6, C andD) confirmed these expectations. After 10 min of cell dialysis with BAPTA-containing solution, CRAC current (at −80 mV) developed in all 14 control cells tested, and on average its density was −2.4 ± 0.3 pA/pF (n = 14). When BEL (20 ॖm) was present in the pipette, the total of 12 cells tested could be divided into three groups: (a) in four cells BEL completely prevented the development of CRAC current, and after 10 min of cell dialysis the inward current was negligible (−0.2 ± 0.1 pA/pF), (b) in four cells CRAC current developed, but was significantly smaller than control (−1.1 ± 0.3 pA/pF), and (c) in four other cells maximum CRAC current density was about the same (or even higher) as in control (−2.8 ± 0.6 pA/pF). Fig. 6, C and D, show and compare the time course of development and I/V relationships of the CRAC current in control cells and in three (a–c) groups of RBL cells acutely treated with BEL. These results confirmed that functional iPLA2 is indeed required for activation of CRAC channels in RBL cells. Thus, inhibition of expression or functional activity of iPLA2 leads to the impairment of store-dependent activation of SOC channels and capacitative Ca2+ influx in a variety of cell types. These studies demonstrate that iPLA2 is a crucial molecular determinant in activation of store-operated channels and capacitative Ca2+ influx in different cell types. This result is somewhat unexpected, because iPLA2 has never before been considered as an important component of store-operated Ca2+ influx pathway in any of the models proposed so far (see Refs. 34Putney J.W. Broad L.M. Braun F. Lievremont J. Bird G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 114: 2223-2229Google Scholar and 35Venkatachalam K. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Ma H.-T. Gill D.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E263-E272Google Scholar for recent review of the existing models). Our results provide strong evidence that activation of capacitative Ca2+ influx mediated by two types of SOC channels (CRAC in RBL cells and Jurkat T-lymphocytes and nonselective SOC in SMC and platelets) require the presence and functional activity of iPLA2. Molecular (antisense) and functional (BEL) inhibition of iPLA2 produced identical results: in both cases, TG-induced Ca2+ and Mn2+ influx was dramatically and irreversibly impaired, while Ca2+ release from the stores was not affected. Functional inhibition of iPLA2 with BEL also prevented activation of single 3-pS SOC channels and whole-cell CRAC currents upon TG and/or BAPTA-induced depletion of intracellular stores, which provided a convenient pharmacological tool for future studies of the mechanism of iPLA2 involvement in CCE. Although independent lines of evidence presented here show the crucial role of iPLA2 in the activation of SOC channels and capacitative Ca2+ influx, the exact location of iPLA2 in this pathway, and the molecular mechanism of iPLA2-dependent signal transduction, remain to be determined. It is not clear whether iPLA2 is involved in originating the signal from endoplasmic reticulum upon depletion of Ca2+ stores or if it is localized in the plasma membrane and is involved in accepting the signal and/or mediating signal transduction to the SOC channels. In view of the fact that iPLA2 was detected in plasma membrane fraction of SMC (Fig.1, A and C), it can be speculated that it may be co-localized with SOC channels in plasma membrane. Our recent studies showed activation of single SOC channels in excised membrane patches by the calcium influx factor (CIF) (36Trepakova E.S. Csutora P. Marchase R.B. Cohen R.A. Bolotina V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26158-26163Google Scholar) produced upon depletion of Ca2+ stores, and we would like to speculate that iPLA2 may be directly involved in membrane-delimited activation of SOC channels by CIF. Single SOC channels in excised membrane patches from SMC (10Trepakova E.S. Gericke M. Hirakawa Y. Weisbrod R.M. Cohen R.A. Bolotina V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7782-7790Google Scholar) could be an excellent experimental model to address this possibility. Arachidonic acid, a main product of all types of PLA2, including iPLA2, does not seem to be involved in direct activation of SOC channels and CCE (37Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31174-31178Google Scholar, 38Mignen O. Thompson J.L. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35676-35683Google Scholar). It is now well established that arachidonic acid has its own specific target, so called ARC channel (39Mignen O. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9114-9119Google Scholar), which may be responsible for a part of agonist-induced Ca2+ influx in some cells. Contrary to SOC channels it is not regulated by intracellular Ca2+stores and has biophysical, pharmacological, and functional properties that are significantly different from CRAC and nonselective SOC channels (38Mignen O. Thompson J.L. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35676-35683Google Scholar, 40Mignen O. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21365-21374Google Scholar). Alternatively, the products of arachidonic acid degradation may play some role in the store-operated pathway. Recently, it has been shown that inhibition of the lipo-oxygenase (but not cyclo-oxygenase) family of enzymes reduces CRAC current in RBL cells (41Glitsch M.D. Bakowski D. Parekh A.B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 539: 93-106Google Scholar), but the exact mechanism of such effect is not clear. Little is presently known of the potential role of other products of iPLA2. Thus, it remains unclear which products of iPLA2 could be involved in regulation of CCE and SOC channels. The importance of iPLA2 in cellular function is not limited to its housekeeping role in phospholipid remodeling (maintenance of membrane integrity) that involves generation of lysophospholipid acceptors for incorporation of arachidonic acid into phospholipids. Other important signaling functions of iPLA2 have also been suggested (see Refs. 24Winstead M.V. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 28-39Google Scholar and 42Six D.A. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 1-19Google Scholar for the most recent review), including its role in agonist-induced stimulation of smooth muscle (43Jenkins C.M. Han X. Mancuso D.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32807-32814Google Scholar) and endothelial cells (44Seegers H.C. Gross R.W. Boyle W.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 918-923Google Scholar, 45Creer M.H. McHowat J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1498-C1507Google Scholar), in lymphocyte proliferation (46Roshak A.K. Capper E.A. Stevenson C. Eichman C. Marshall L.A. J. Biol.

We believe that introduction of iPLA2 as a novel determinant in the store-operated Ca2+ influx pathway may open many new directions for studying physiological and pathological functions in excitable and nonexcitable cells. It may also shed some new light on the still mysterious mechanism of activation of store-operated channels. We thank Drs.

Potent and specific PTP1B inhibitors could serve as useful tools in elucidating the physiological functions of PTP1B and may constitute valuable therapeutics in the treatment of several human diseases. We have determined the crystal structure of PTP1B in complex with compound 2, the most potent and selective PTP1B inhibitor reported to date. The structure at 2.15-Å resolution reveals that compound 2 simultaneously binds to the active site and a unique proximal noncatalytic site formed by Lys-41, Arg-47, and Asp-48. The structural data are further corroborated by results from kinetic analyses of the interactions of PTP1B and its site-directed mutants with compound 2 and several of its variants. Although many of the residues important for interactions between PTP1B and compound 2 are not unique to PTP1B, the combinations of all contact residues differ between PTP isozymes, which provide a structural basis for potent and selective PTP1B inhibition.

Evidence suggests that PTPs can exert both positive and negative effects on signaling pathways and play crucial physiological roles in a variety of mammalian tissues and cells. Defective or inappropriate regulation of PTP activity can lead to aberrant tyrosine phosphorylation, which contributes to the development of many human diseases including cancers and diabetes (1Neel B.G. Tonics N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Google Scholar, 2Zhang Z.-Y. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2001; 5: 416-423Google Scholar). Given the complexity of cellular signaling and the large number of phosphoproteins in the cell, it is likely that a single PTP may be involved in the regulation of multiple signaling pathways, and that multiple PTPs may act cooperatively to regulate a particular pathway. For example, PTP1B is regarded as a major negative regulator of both insulin- and leptin-stimulated signal transduction pathways (3Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S.

In addition to a role in insulin and leptin signaling, PTP1B is also implicated in several other physiological and pathological processes including transformation by the Neu oncogene (7Wiener J.R.

Lilien J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 523-532Google Scholar) and p130cas (Crk-associated substrate) (13Liu F. Hill D.E. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31290-31295Google Scholar). These results, taken together, suggest that PTP1B may be a participant in several signaling pathways. Conversely, in addition to PTP1B, both leukocyte common antigen-related phosphate and PTPα have been implicated as negative regulators of insulin signaling (2Zhang Z.-Y. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2001; 5: 416-423Google Scholar). A major goal in the PTP field is to establish the precise functional roles for individual PTPs, both in normal cellular physiology and in pathogenic conditions. This is an important prerequisite for PTP-based drug discovery in order to minimize unwanted side effects. Potent and selective PTP inhibitors would be extremely useful in helping to delineate the physiological roles of PTPs and to validate them as therapeutic targets. Furthermore, these inhibitors could provide the foundation upon which therapeutically useful agents can be devised. Unfortunately, as a consequence of the conserved nature of the PTP-active sites (i.e. Tyr(P)-binding sites), there are currently few PTP inhibitors that exhibit the potency and specificity required for biological and pharmacological investigation. Fortunately, PTP substrate specificity studies have shown that Tyr(P) alone is not sufficient for high affinity binding and that residues flanking Tyr(P) furnish additional interactions for specific and high affinity substrate recognition (14Zhang Z.-Y. Maclean D. Thieme-Sefler A.M. McNamara D. Dobrusin E.M. Sawyer T.K. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4446-4450Google Scholar, 15Zhang Z.-Y. Maclean D. McNamara D.J. Sawyer T.K.

These studies, together with the discovery of a second aryl phosphate-binding site adjacent to the active site in PTP1B (21Puius Y.A. Zhao Y. Sullivan M. Lawrence D.S. Almo S.C. Zhang Z.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13420-13425Google Scholar), demonstrated the potential for multiple site recognition of substrates by PTPs. They also suggested a novel paradigm for the design of potent and specific PTP inhibitors, namely bidentate ligands that bind to both the active site and a unique adjacent peripheral site. By using this approach we have acquired a highly potent and selective PTP1B inhibitor (Fig. 1, compound1), which displays a Ki value of 2.4 nm for PTP1B and exhibits several orders of magnitude selectivity in favor of PTP1B against a panel of PTPs (22Shen K. Keng Y.-F. Wu L. Guo X.-L. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47311-47319Google Scholar). Compound1 is the most potent and selective PTP1B inhibitor reported to date. This result serves as a proof-of-concept in PTP inhibitor development, as it demonstrates the feasibility of acquiring potent, yet highly selective, PTP inhibitory agents. In order to gain insight into the structural basis of the potency and selectivity of compound1 for PTP1B, and to lay the groundwork for the future design of more potent and specific inhibitors that can interfere with the processes controlled by PTP1B and other PTPs, we have determined the crystal structure of PTP1B in complex with compound 2 (Fig.1). Compounds 1 and 2 exhibit identical potency and selectivity profiles. In addition, we used a combination of kinetic studies and site-directed mutagenesis to probe the binding interactions between compound 1 (and several analogs thereof) and PTP1B. p-Nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) was purchased from Fluka. All mutant forms of PTP1B were generated using the QuickChange kit from Stratagene (23Guo X.-L. Shen K. Wang F. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41014-41022Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primers used for mutagenesis were from Sigma. All of the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The catalytic domain of PTP1B (residues 1–321) and its mutants were expressed inEscherichia coli and purified to homogeneity as described previously (21Puius Y.A. Zhao Y. Sullivan M. Lawrence D.S.

Compounds 2 and 4 were synthesized on the Rink amide resin using a standard protocol for 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate/N-hydroxybenzotriazole/N-methylmorpholine activation of carboxylic acids. The coupling reaction was performed in N,N-dimethylformamide for 1.5 h using a 3-fold excess of acid relative to resin-bound amine. The following compounds were sequentially coupled to the Rink resin to furnish compound 2:N-α-[(9H-fluoren-9-yl methoxy)carbonyl]-S-trityl-l-cysteine, 6-(9H-fluoren-9-ylmethoxycarbonylamino)-hexanoic acid, 4-(difluorophosphonomethyl)-N-[(9H-fluoren-9-yl methoxy)carbonyl]-l-phenylalanine,N-α-[(9H-fluoren-9-yl methoxy)carbonyl]-l-aspartic acid-ॆ-t-butyl ester, and 4-(phosphonodifluoromethyl)phenylacetic acid. Fmoc removal after each coupling was effected by 207 piperidine inN,N-dimethylformamide. Final cleavage and side chain deprotection was achieved by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid with 57 1,2-ethanedithiol and 17 m-cresol at room temperature for 3 h. Removal of the solvent in vacuogave a crude oil that was triturated with cold ether. The crude mixture thus obtained was centrifuged; the ether was removed by decantation, and the resulting white solid was purified by semipreparative reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (H2O/CH3CN in 0.17 trifluoroacetic acid). Compound 2 was obtained as a white solid by lyophilization.1H NMR (300 MHz, CD3OD): δ 1.05 (m, 2H), 1.24 (m, 2H), 1.43 (m, 2H), 2.17 (t, 2H, J = 7.3 Hz), 2.58–3.00 (m, 10H), 3.52 (s, 2H), 4.32–4.53 (m, 3H), 7.18 (d, 2H, J = 8.0 Hz), 7.24 (d, 2H, J = 8.0 Hz), 7.44 (d, 2H, J = 7.3 Hz), 7.46 (d, 2H,J = 7.3 Hz); 31P NMR (121.5 MHz, CD3OD): δ 5.32 (t, J = 107.0 Hz);19F NMR (282 MHz, CD3OD) δ −108.6 (d,J = 107.0 Hz), −108.8 (d, J = 107.0 Hz); electrospray ionization-mass spectroscopy was a calculated mass of 873.2 and found at [M + H]+ 874.1. The following compounds were sequentially coupled to the Rink resin to furnish compound 4: Fmoc-4-phosphonodifluoromethyl-l-phenyalanine with an unprotected side chain, Fmoc-l-tyrosine with atert-butyl protected side chain, and 4-phosphonodifluoromethylphenylacetic acid (23Guo X.-L. Shen K. Wang F. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41014-41022Google Scholar). Fmoc removal was effected by 207 piperidine inN,N-dimethylformamide. Final cleavage and side chain deprotection was achieved by treatment with a mixture of 2.57 triisopropylsilane, 2.57 water, and 957 trifluoroacetic acid at room temperature for 2.5 h. The resin was removed by filtration, and the remaining solution was concentrated. The residue was triturated with ether, dissolved in water, and purified by semi-preparative reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (0.17 trifluoroacetic acid in water and acetonitrile) to afford the desired compound.

Kinetic parameters for PTP1B-catalyzed hydrolysis of pNPP and inhibition constants for PTP1B inhibitors were determined as described previously (23Guo X.-L. Shen K. Wang F. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41014-41022Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at 30 °C in 50 mm3,3-dimethylglutarate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm EDTA with an ionic strength of 0.15 m adjusted with NaCl. All crystallization experiments were carried out at 4 °C using either the hanging drop or the sitting drop vapor diffusion methods. Native PTP1B crystals were grown according to published conditions (25Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1397-1404Google Scholar). In soaking experiments, PTP1B crystals were immersed in crystallization solutions containing PTP1B inhibitors over a range of concentrations (from 0.3 to 1 mm) overnight. For co-crystallization, stock solutions of PTP1B in 100 mm MES (pH 6.5), 25 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 3.0 mmdithiothreitol were prepared with 1 mm PTP1B inhibitor. In each well, 2 ॖl of 10 mg/ml PTP1B solution was mixed with an equal volume of the precipitating solution (90 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 6.0–7.5), 90 mm magnesium acetate, 57 Jeffamine 600, and 23.37 (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000), and the mixture was equilibrated against 0.5 ml of the precipitating solution. A single crystal was washed several times in immersion oil type B (Cargille Laboratories) and flash-frozen in a stream of nitrogen gas at −178 °C. Data were collected using a wavelength of 0.98 Å, and 420 frames of 0.5° were recorded on a MARCCD detector at beamline X9A of the National Synchrotron Light Source (Brookhaven National Laboratory).

Diffraction from the PTP1B/compound2 co-crystal is consistent with the space group P212121 (a = 52.84 Å, b = 85.62 Å, and c = 88.68 Å). Although similar to crystals of PTP1B bound to the consensus peptide ELEFpYMDYE-NH2 (where pY is Tyr(P)) (20Sarmiento M. Puius Y.A. Vetter S.W. Keng Y.-F. Wu L. Zhao Y. Lawrence D.S. Almo S.C. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8171-8179Google Scholar), a 3.5-Å difference in the b axis (∼47) precluded structure solution by difference Fourier method. Accordingly, the structure was solved by molecular replacement using the structure of PTP1B/C215S with the consensus peptide as the search model (20Sarmiento M. Puius Y.A. Vetter S.W. Keng Y.-F. Wu L. Zhao Y. Lawrence D.S. Almo S.C. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8171-8179Google Scholar), excluding solvent molecules, ions, and the peptide. Rotation and translation searches with program CNS (27Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar) using data in the 30–4-Å resolution range yielded an unambiguous solution with a correlation coefficient of 0.623 and a packing value of 50.227, respectively. After one cycle of rigid body refinement and simulated annealing, both 2Fo − Fc andFo − Fc electron density maps showed clear density for compound 2 in and adjacent to the active site of PTP1B. Subsequent refinement consisted of manual rebuilding, simulated annealing, and individual temperature factor refinement using all data from 30 to 2.15 Å. Model building was performed using Program O (28Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar). Simulated annealing OMIT maps, Rfree values, PROCHECK, and WHAT IF were employed to ensure correct model building and stereochemistry. The final model comprises residues 2–298, one inhibitor molecule, 110 ordered water molecules, 2 magnesium ions, and 2 acetate ions. Initial crystallization experiments were performed with compound 1 (Fig.1). After the stock of compound1 was depleted, subsequent crystallization trials were conducted with compound 2 (Fig. 1), a synthetic intermediate used to prepare fluorescently labeled or cell-permeable analogs of compound 1. Compound 2 displays the same potency (Ki = 1.8 nm) and selectivity toward PTP1B as compound 1 (Ki = 2.4 nm). This is consistent with our previous observations that attachment of an ethyl thiol group to the C-terminal carboxyamide of Tyr(P) did not affect the affinity of substrates for PTP1B (22Shen K. Keng Y.-F. Wu L. Guo X.-L. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47311-47319Google Scholar). Soaking native PTP1B crystals with either compound 1 or2 significantly changed the diffraction patterns, indicating that both inhibitors could bind PTP1B in the crystalline state; however, these data were difficult to process due to high mosaicity of the crystals. PTP1B could be crystallized as very thin needles in the presence of the inhibitor at a 1:3 ratio in the same crystallization conditions of the native protein (25Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1397-1404Google Scholar). Microseeding or macroseeding produced larger needles, although the best crystal of this form exhibited diffraction to only 3.2 Å. After an extensive search of crystallization conditions, the additive Jeffamine 600 (90 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.0, 90 mm magnesium acetate, 57 Jeffamine 600, and 23.37 (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000) resulted in high quality crystals for the complex of PTP1B with compound 2 that diffracted to 2.15-Å resolution. The final model for the PTP1B·2 complex included PTP1B residues 2–298 and all atoms in compound 2 except the 1-carbamoyl-2-mercaptoethylcarbamoyl portion in the C-terminal extension. The structure was refined to an R-factor of 20.27 (Rfree = 24.07) for data from 30 to 2.15 Å (TableI). Compound 2 was unambiguously fitted to well defined electron density (Fig.2). The overall structure of PTP1B in the complex is very similar to those observed in the complexes between PTP1B and Tyr(P)-containing peptides (16Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Google Scholar, 20Sarmiento M. Puius Y.A. Vetter S.W. Keng Y.-F. Wu L. Zhao Y. Lawrence D.S. Almo S.C. Zhang Z.-Y.

As observed in other complexes, the WPD loop (residues 179–189) adopts a closed conformation in the PTP1B·2 structure. Compound2 extensively interacts with PTP1B in a defined manner such that phosphonodifluoromethylphenylalanine (F2Pmp) occupies the active site, the linker Asp forms interactions with residues Arg-47 and Asp-48, and the distal 4-phosphonodifluoromethyl phenylacetyl group makes both van der Waals and ionic contacts with Arg-47 and Lys-41 (Fig. 3). These assignments are in complete agreement with predictions based on biochemical and mutational analyses (23Guo X.-L. Shen K. Wang F. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41014-41022Google Scholar). Although the first five methylene units extending from the carboxyamide of F2Pmp are visible in the electron density map, they make no significant interactions with PTP1B, consistent with the finding that compounds 1 and2 exhibit the same potency and selectivity against PTP1B.Figure 3Overall binding mode of compound 2 withPTP1B. a, details of the interactions between compound2 and PTP1B.

The blue, white, and red shadingsrepresent positively charged (+84 kT), neutral, and negatively charged (−62 kT) surface regions, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The F2Pmp in compound 2 assumes the same position in the active site of PTP1B as that observed for Tyr(P) in PTP1B-phosphopeptide complexes. The three terminal phosphonate oxygens form an extensive array of hydrogen bonds with the main chain nitrogens of the phosphate-binding loop (residues 215–221) and the guanidinium side chain of Arg-221 (Fig.4a). The phenyl ring of F2Pmp is sandwiched between the side chains of Tyr-46 and Phe-182 and makes van der Waals contacts with the side chains of Ala-217, Ile-219, Val-49, and Gln-262 (Fig. 4b). These interactions are observed in almost all PTP1B complexes containing Tyr(P) in the active site. Unique to F2Pmp, which is a nonhydrolyzable mimic of Tyr(P), is the difluoromethylene group that replaces the phenolic oxygen in Tyr(P). The two fluorine atoms at the benzylic position are known to be important for high affinity binding to PTP1B. For example, when Tyr(P) in the hexapeptide DADEpYL-NH2 is replaced with F2Pmp, the Ki for the resulting peptide (200 nm for PTP1B) is over 1000 times more potent than the same peptide containing phosphonomethylphenylalanine (Pmp) (30Burke Jr., T.R.

The structure of PTP1B·2 provides direct evidence for the proposed specific interactions between the fluorine atoms and PTP1B active site residues (31Chen L. Wu L. Otaka A. Smyth M.S. Roller P.P. Burke T.R. den Hertog J. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 976-984Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4c, the fluorine atoms and one of the terminal oxygens of the phosphonate are hydrogen-bonded to an enzyme-bound water molecule that is coordinated by the main chain nitrogen of Phe-182 and the amide side chain of Gln-266. A similar water molecule is also observed in several PTP1B-Tyr(P) peptide and PTP1B-difluorophosphonate complexes (20Sarmiento M. Puius Y.A. Vetter S.W. Keng Y.-F. Wu L. Zhao Y. Lawrence D.S.

Patel V. Friesen R.W. Ramachandran C. Becker J.W. Leblanc Y. Kennedy B.P. Scapin G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9043-9051Google Scholar). In addition to the H-bonds, the fluorine atoms are also involved in van der Waals interactions (17 total, 8 of which are in the range of 3.5–4.0 Å, the remainders are within 4.5 Å) with the side chains of Phe-182, Asp-181, and Gln-262. In addition to the interactions between F2Pmp and the active site, there are extensive and specific interactions between several PTP1B surface residues beyond the active site with the remainder of compound 2. Fig. 4ashows specific polar interactions between compound 2 and PTP1B. Most notably, Asp-48 forms two hydrogen bonds to the main chain nitrogen and the C-terminal amide of F2Pmp. In addition, Arg-47 plays a critical role for high affinity binding of compound2. The side chain of Arg-47 is highly flexible and can adopt different conformations depending on the nature of the residues immediately N-terminal to Tyr(P) (20Sarmiento M. Puius Y.A. Vetter S.W. Keng Y.-F. Wu L. Zhao Y. Lawrence D.S. Almo S.C. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8171-8179Google Scholar). In the structure of PTP1B·2, Arg-47 is found in a conformation that is distinct from those observed in previous studies, enabling Arg-47 to make contacts with both the Asp linker and the distal aryl difluorophosphonate group. Specifically, the main chain nitrogen of Arg-47 makes a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl of the 4-phosphonodifluoromethylphenylacetyl group, whereas the guanidinium group of Arg-47 forms two hydrogen bonds with the Asp side chain of compound 2. A polar interaction between the Nη2 of Arg-47 and a fluorine atom of the distal difluorophosphonate group is also observed. Further away from the active site, the amino group of Lys-41 forms a hydrogen bond with one phosphonate oxygen and engages in a polar interaction with a fluorine atom of the distal difluorophosphonate. In addition to electrostatic interactions, there are also van der Waals contacts between PTP1B and the Asp and 4-phosphonodifluoromethyl phenylacetyl group in compound 2 (Fig. 4b). Thus, Cॆ and Cγ of Asp-48 are observed to be within van der Waals contacts of Cα of F2Pmp and Cα, Cॆ, and Cγ of the Asp residue in compound 2. The fluorine atoms at the benzylic position of the distal difluorophosphonate are engaged in nonpolar interactions with the Cδ of both Lys-41 and Arg-47. Finally, the aliphatic portion of the side chain of Arg-47 is involved in extensive hydrophobic interactions with the phenyl ring of the 4-phosphonodif"

Recent studies suggest that inorganic arsenic may act as a tumor promoter by perturbing key signaling transduction pathways. We have shown previously that arsenite can potently activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades and induce the expression of proliferation-associated genes, including proto-oncogenes c-jun and c-fos. In order to elucidate further the molecular mechanisms underlying its tumor-promoting properties, we investigated the signaling events involved in arsenite-mediated induction of c-fos and c-jun. We found that induction of both c-fos and c-jun by arsenite can be substantially inhibited by the MEK- selective inhibitor U0126, suggesting that the ERK pathway is critically involved in their up-regulation. Interestingly, arsenite dramatically induced the phosphorylation and acetylation of histone H3 preceding the induction of mRNAs encoding c-fos and c-jun. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that arsenite treatment markedly induced the phosphorylation/acetylation of histone H3 associated with the c-fos and c-jun genes through an ERK-dependent pathway. Our results strongly suggest that arsenic-triggered alterations in chromatin structure perturb specific gene transcription, including that of proto-oncogenes c-jun and c-fos, and may thereby contribute to the carcinogenic process.

Kaiser J. Science. 1996; 274: 174-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Epidemiological studies have shown that chronic arsenic exposure is associated with an increased incidence of skin, lung, and bladder cancers (1Bagla P. Kaiser J. Science. 1996; 274: 174-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 2Germolec D.R. Yoshida T. Gaido K. Wilmer J.L. Simeonova P.P. Kayama F. Burleson F. Dong W. Lange R.W. Luster M.I. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 141: 308-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the present arsenic regulatory standard of 50 ppb in drinking water, issued by the United States Environmental Protection Agency in 1942, the cancer risk due to arsenic contamination is estimated to be comparable with that of environmental tobacco smoke or radon in homes (3Smith A.H. Hopenhayn-Rich C. Bates M.N. Goeden H.M. Hertz- Picciotto I. Duggan H.M. Wood R. Kosnett M.J. Smith M.T. Environ. Health Perspect. 1992; 97: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). A recent analysis conducted by the National Academy of Sciences indicated that the risk of lung and bladder cancer from arsenic in drinking water is several times higher than that estimated by the Environmental Protection Agency when it developed its 10-ppb standard (projected to go into effect in 2006). According to the new analysis, at the arsenic standard of 10 ppb in drinking water, the combined lifetime risk of lung and bladder cancer is between 30 and 37 per 10,000 people (4National Research Council Arsenic in Drinking Water: 2001 Update. National Academy Press, Washington, D. C.2001: 217-225Google Scholar). In fact, ∼350,000 individuals in the United States drink water containing arsenic levels higher than 50 ppb (3Smith A.H. Hopenhayn-Rich C. Bates M.N. Goeden H.M. Hertz- Picciotto I. Duggan H.M. Wood R. Kosnett M.J. Smith M.T. Environ. Health Perspect. 1992; 97: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). In many developing countries, arsenic contamination in drinking water can be as high as 1,800 ppb and represents a very serious threat to public health (1Bagla P. Kaiser J. Science. 1996; 274: 174-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar,5Tian D. Ma H. Feng Z. Xia Y. Le X.C. Ni Z. Allen J. Collins B. Schreinemachers D. Mumford J.L. J. Toxicol. Environ.

Although epidemiological studies have long established that arsenite is potently carcinogenic, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Two plausible models have been proposed to explain the carcinogenic actions of arsenic. According to the first and more controversial model, arsenite would cause genetic abnormalities affecting chromosome structure without directly interacting with DNA (6Snow E.T. Pharmacol. Ther. 1992; 53: 31-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 7Hei T.K. Liu S.X. Waldren C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2001; 98: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). In the second model, arsenite is proposed to act as a tumor promoter (6Snow E.T. Pharmacol. Ther. 1992; 53: 31-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 9Cavigelli M. Li W.W. Lin A. Su B. Yoshioka K. Karin M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6269-6279Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The latter hypothesis is supported by the findings that arsenite can induce anchorage independence in human diploid fibroblasts (10Landolph J.R. Biol. Trace Elem. Res. 1989; 21: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), enhance cell proliferation in bladder epithelium in mice (11Simeonova P.P. Wang S. Toriuma W. Kommineni V. Matheson J. Unimye N.

Res. 1997; 386: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Consistent with the notion that arsenite acts on signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation, a number of proliferation-associated genes, notably the proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-jun, have been found to be induced rapidly in response to arsenite (9Cavigelli M. Li W.W. Lin A. Su B. Yoshioka K. Karin M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6269-6279Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 11Simeonova P.P. Wang S. Toriuma W. Kommineni V. Matheson J. Unimye N. Kayama F.

Biol. 1998; 18: 5178-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Both proto-oncogenes encode components of the mitogen-inducible immediate-early transcription factor AP-1 and have been implicated in promoting cell proliferation by affecting G1 to S-phase progression. Moreover, it is well established that the abnormal expression of both c-fos and c-jun can induce cell transformation (16Shaulian E. Karin M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2390-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). Recently, c-jun induction in response to proliferative stimuli was shown further to be critical for the down-regulation of both the tumor suppressor p53 and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21/WAF-1/CIP1 (17Schreiber M. Kolbus A. Piu F. Szabowski A. Mohle-Steinlein U. Tian J. Karin M. Angel P. Wagner E.F. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 607-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Therefore, perturbation of the expression of c-fos and c-jun by arsenic compounds is likely to play an important role in carcinogenesis. The signal transduction pathways that regulate c-fos and c-jun transcription have been thoroughly investigated. The mitogen-activated protein (MAP)1 kinase pathway plays a crucial role in the induction of both c-fos and c-jun in response to many extracellular stimuli, such as growth factors and cellular stress (18Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2299) Google Scholar, 19Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). Recent studies (20Clayton A.L. Rose S. Barratt M.J. Mahadevan L.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3714-3726Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 21Cheung P. Allis C.D. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 2000; 103: 263-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar) have indicated that growth factors can stimulate nucleosomal histone H3 phosphorylation/acetylation at the loci of both c-fos and c-jun through a MAP kinase-dependent mechanism, thus providing an important link between the signaling events initiated at the cell membrane and the modulation of gene transcription in the nucleus. Like growth factors, arsenite can also activate various MAP kinase cascades, including those that culminate in the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 (22Liu Y. Guyton K.Z. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Lee J.C. Holbrook N.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). ERK activation by arsenite is primarily mediated by the epidermal growth factor receptor and the oncoprotein Shc (15Chen W. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5178-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In this report, we have extended our early studies on the carcinogenic mechanisms of arsenite and have investigated the chromatin modifications occurring at the nucleosomes of c-fos and c-jun following arsenite stimulation. We report that arsenite induces rapid phosphorylation and acetylation of histone H3, events that precede the induction of both c-fos and c-jun in normal human diploid fibroblasts. By using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, we demonstrate that the arsenite-triggered phosphoacetylation of histone H3 on the c-fos and c-jun chromatin is primarily mediated by the ERK MAP kinase cascade. Our results support the notion that arsenic compounds can induce chromatin remodeling leading to the altered expression of genes which, as illustrated by proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-jun, may contribute to their carcinogenic effects. Early passage WI-38 human diploid fibroblast cells were cultured in minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). Subconfluent cultures were rendered quiescent by incubating the cells in minimum essential medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 36 h prior to treatment. Sodium arsenite (Sigma) and trichostatin A (TSA, Sigma) were directly added to the medium. U0126 (Promega, Madison, WI), SB203580 (Sigma), SB202190 (Calbiochem), PD169316 (Calbiochem) and p38 MAP kinase inhibitor (p38 INH,Calbiochem) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and added to the medium to a final concentration of 10 μm 15 min prior to treatment. Total RNA was isolated with STAT-60 (Tel-Test B, Friendswood, TX) and Northern blot analysis performed as described previously (23Li J. Gorospe M. Hutter D. Barnes J. Keyse S.M. Liu Y. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2412) Google Scholar), respectively. To monitor differences in loading and transfer among samples, blots were stripped and rehybridized with an end-labeled oligonucleotide complementary to the 18 S rRNA. To analyze the phosphorylation status of various MAP kinases, Western blotting was performed as described previously (23Li J. Gorospe M. Hutter D. Barnes J. Keyse S.M. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8213-8224Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) using 20 μg of total cell lysate. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies recognizing phospho-p38, total p38, and phospho-p44/p42 ERK MAP kinases were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). A mouse monoclonal antibody against p44/p42 ERK was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). To detect the modification of histone H3, crude histone proteins were extracted using sulfuric acid (23Li J. Gorospe M. Hutter D. Barnes J. Keyse S.M. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8213-8224Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and then analyzed by Western blotting using rabbit polyclonal antibodies recognizing either phospho-histone H3 (Ser(P)-10) (Cell Signaling), phosphoacetyl-histone H3 (Ser(P)-10/Ac-Lys-14, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), phospho-histone H2A.X (p-Ser-139, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), acetyl-histone H3 (Ac-Lys-14, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), acetyl-histone H3 (Ac-Lys-9,14, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), or a rabbit antibody recognizing total histone H3 (Cell Signaling). For the immunofluorescence studies, Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and Alexa 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were used according to the manufacturer's specifications. Phospho-histone H3 was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody specifically recognizing phosphorylated (Ser-10) histone H3 (Cell Signaling). Total histone H3 was detected using a mouse monoclonal antibody (25Sauve D.M. Anderson H.J. Ray J.M. James W.M. Roberge M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). DAPI staining was performed as described previously (26Chen P. Hutter D. Yang X. Gorospe M. Davis R.J. Liu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29440-29449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Samples were visualized by either fluorescence microscopy (Carl Zeiss, New York) or confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM-410 inverted confocal microscope equipped with a 63× NA 1.4 oil immersion objective). The confocal pinhole was set to obtain a spatial resolution of 0.4 μm in the horizontal plane and 1 μm in the axial dimension. Image processing and presentation were done using MataMorph 4.6.3 software (Universal Imaging, Inc., West Chester, PA). MSK1 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using a polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), and its activity was determined by assessing the phosphorylation of a synthetic peptide (Crosstide) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (23Li J. Gorospe M. Hutter D. Barnes J. Keyse S.M. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8213-8224Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). ERK activity was determined by immune complex kinase assays using myelin basic protein (MBP, Sigma) as a substrate as described previously (26Chen P. Hutter D. Yang X. Gorospe M. Davis R.J. Liu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29440-29449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). MAPKAPK2/3 activity was determined by immunocomplex kinase assays using recombinant Hsp25 (25-kDa heat-shock protein, Stressgen, Vancouver, Canada) as a substrate as described previously (27Hutter D. Chen P. Barnes J. Liu Y. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Chromatin was cross-linked using formaldehyde and broken down to fragments with an average size of ∼2 kbp through brief sonication according to Clayton et al. (20Clayton A.L. Rose S. Barratt M.J. Mahadevan L.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3714-3726Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The resulting chromatin solution was divided equally into four fractions that were subsequently used for isolating input DNA (fraction 1) or performing ChIP assays (fractions 2–4). Chromatin solutions were first incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 10 μl of rabbit pre-immune serum or with 10 μl of purified antibody specifically recognizing phospho-histone H3 (Ser(P)-10) or 40 μl of purified antibody specifically recognizing phospho-acetylhistone H3 (Ser(P)-10/Ac-Lys-14, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Bovine serum albumin (final concentration 200 μg/ml), sonicated λ phage DNA (5 μg), and protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to the solutions and incubated overnight with gentle rotation at 4 °C. The beads were washed extensively as described previously (23Li J. Gorospe M. Hutter D. Barnes J. Keyse S.M. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8213-8224Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The resulting immunoprecipitates or input chromatin solutions were then incubated with RNase A (50 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C and then digested for 16 h using proteinase K (100 μg/ml). The input and immunoprecipitated chromatin were incubated at 65 °C for ≥6 h to reverse the formaldehyde cross-links. The DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and dissolved in 30 μl of water. Real time PCR was performed using SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix and GeneAmp® 5700 Sequencing Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the following parameters: 5 min at 50 °C, 10 min at 95 °C and then 40 cycles of denaturation (95 °C, 30 s), annealing (60 °C, 30 s), and extension (72 °C, 30 s). Primer pair GGTCTGCTTCCACGCTTTGCACTGAATTAG and AGCGCCTTTTTACCCTTGTACGGAAACTG was used to amplify a 172-bp region in the c-fos promoter. Primer pair GGGTTGACTGGTAGCAGATAAGTGTTGAG and TCTGGGCAGTTAGAGAGAAGGTGAAAAG was used to amplify a 200-bp fragment in the human c-jun promoter. Primer pair GGCAAGGTGAACGTGGATGAAGTTGGTG and GGAGTGGACAGATCCCCAAAGGACTCAAAG was used to amplify a 237-bp region in the human β-globin gene. After SYBR Green PCR amplification, data acquisition and subsequent data analyses were performed using the GeneAmp 5700 sequence detection system (version 1.3). For all the amplifications described in this paper, the threshold value of the ΔRn was considered to be 0.5. The PCR cycle where a statistically significant increase in the ΔRn was first detected is called the threshold cycle (CT). Target DNA copy number and CT values are inversely related. The absolute levels of c-fos and c-jun in the experimental samples were determined by extrapolating the CT values from the standard curves of the genomic DNA. It has been shown that in mouse fibroblasts, expression of several oncogenes, including Ha-RasT24, v-mos, and v-fes, leads to enhanced phosphorylation of histone H3 (28Chadee D.N. Hendzel M.J.

Likewise, stimulation of cells with three well established tumor promoters, TPA, okadaic acid, and UVC, also increased histone H3 phosphorylation (28Chadee D.N. Hendzel M.J. Tylipski C.P. Allis C.D.

To address whether arsenite triggers histone H3 modifications, histone H3 phosphorylation in normal human lung fibroblast WI-38 cells was examined by immunofluorescence, using an antibody that recognizes phospho-histone H3 (Ser(P)-10). Compared with control cells, where the level of phospho-histone H3 was low, arsenite triggered a rapid increase of phospho-histone H3 in the nucleus. As shown in Fig.1A, the levels of phospho-histone H3 after a 60-min treatment with arsenite were comparable with those seen after treatment with a combination of EGF and anisomycin, shown previously (20Clayton A.L. Rose S. Barratt M.J. Mahadevan L.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3714-3726Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) to enhance potently histone H3 phosphorylation. EGF-stimulated histone H3 phosphorylation is reportedly restricted to a small subset of nucleosomes that are associated with active gene transcription (20Clayton A.L. Rose S. Barratt M.J. Mahadevan L.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3714-3726Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 21Cheung P. Allis C.D. Sassone-Corsi P.

Likewise, in Drosophilasalivary glands, heat shock significantly stimulates histone H3 phosphorylation at a few loci where the heat shock protein genes are located (35Nowak S.J. Corces V.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3003-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). To investigate whether arsenite stimulates phosphorylation of histone H3 throughout the entire nucleus or only at a few loci, confocal microscopy was performed. A mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated histone H3 was used to visualize all histone H3 proteins (Fig. 1B). In unstimulated cells, only a few loci were intensely stained by the phospho-histone H3 antibody (Fig. 1B). By contrast, in cells stimulated with EGF + anisomycin, phospho-histone H3 was markedly elevated and displayed a punctate staining pattern in the nucleus (Fig.1B). As seen in the EGF + anisomycin treatment group, arsenite stimulation also resulted in a dramatic increase in phospho-histone H3, revealing a similar punctate staining pattern in the nucleus (Fig. 1B). The marked difference between the staining patterns of phospho-histone H3 and total histone H3 in arsenite-stimulated cells strongly suggests that arsenite induces the phosphorylation of histone H3 at a subset of nuclear loci (Fig.1B). To examine further the effect of arsenite on histone H3 modification, histone proteins were extracted with sulfuric acid from either untreated or arsenite-treated cells. Histone H3 modification was examined by Western blotting using antibodies specific for either phospho-histone H3 (Ser(P)-10) or dually modified histone H3 (Ser(P)-10/Ac-Lys-14). Arsenite treatment led to increased histone H3 phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner. This modification was visible within 10 min after the addition of arsenite into the medium and continued to increase over the period studied (Fig.2A). Phosphoacetyl-histone H3 increased in a time-dependent fashion with kinetics similar to that of histone H3 phosphorylation (Fig. 2A), supporting the notion that phosphorylation and acetylation of histone H3 are tightly coupled events (21Cheung P. Allis C.D. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 2000; 103: 263-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). In contrast, bulk levels of acetylated H3 did not significantly change after arsenite treatment (Fig.2A), presumably because acetylated H3 is generally associated with actively transcribing chromatin, whereas arsenite-regulated genes constitute only a small subset of the genome, so arsenite treatment did not greatly affect total levels of acetylated H3, whereas TSA induced hyperacetylation of histone H3 (Fig.2A). To confirm the specificity of the phosphoacetyl-H3 antibody on Western blots, lysates from TSA- and EGF + anisomycin-treated cells were included as positive controls for both phospho-histone H3 and phosphoacetyl-H3 antibodies (Fig.2A), and only acetylation of histone H3 induced by TSA was not recognized by the anti-phosphoacetyl-H3 antibody. These results demonstrate the presence of H3 histone that is dually modified by phosphorylation and acetylation (at Ser-10 and Lys-14, respectively) in arsenite-treated cells. Furthermore, to investigate whether arsenite-induced histone phosphorylation is specific for H3, a rabbit polyclonal antibody recognizing phospho-H1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and a mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing histone phospho-H2A.X (phosphorylated at Ser-139, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) were used for Western blot analysis. Staurosporine-treated Jurkat cells (0.5 μm, 4 h) were included as positive control of phospho-H2A.X. Arsenite treatment did not have any effect on either histone H1 phosphorylation (data not shown) or histone H2A phosphorylation at Ser-139 (Fig. 2A). Because arsenite is a well known activator of MAP kinases ERK and p38, we sought to assess whether activity of MAP kinases was required for the observed histone H3 modifications. Phosphoacetylation of histone H3 in arsenite-treated cells was moderately inhibited in cells that were pretreated with either the MEK inhibitor U0126 or the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (Fig. 2B). Combination of both U0126 and SB203580 resulted in a more significant inhibition of histone modifications (Fig. 2B). These observations suggest that arsenite-triggered MAP kinase activation contributes to the implementation of histone H3 modifications. Protein kinase MSK1 lies downstream of p38 and ERK and can be activated by both mitogenic stimulation and stress (36Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Recent studies (32Thomson S. Clayton A.L. Hazzalin C.A. Rose S. Barratt M.J. Mahadevan L.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4779-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) suggest that MSK1 may play an important role in mediating the phosphorylation of histone H3, thus serving as a link between the MAP kinase cascades and nucleosomal alterations. To examine whether MSK1 could be involved in histone H3 phosphorylation, we examined the kinetics of MSK1 activation following arsenite treatment. MSK1 was immunoprecipitated and assayed using a synthetic peptide (Crosstide) as substrate (36Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Arsenite significantly activated MSK1 in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2C), but this activation was significantly inhibited in cells pretreated with either U0126, SB203580, or a combination of both inhibitors, with the combined inhibitory treatment showing the greatest effect (Fig. 2D). The similarity between the kinetics of histone H3 phosphorylation and MSK1 activation as well as the comparable susceptibility profiles toward the two MAP kinase inhibitors support the hypothesis that MSK1 plays a significant role in modulating histone H3 modification in response to arsenite. To investigate whether histone H3 modification in response to arsenite may play a role in the induction of proliferation-associated genes, we first examined the effect of arsenite on c-fos and c-jun expression in WI-38 cells by Northern blotting (Fig.3A). Basal c-fosand c-jun mRNA levels were very low in unstimulated cells, and arsenite treatment potently increased their abundance in a time- and dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 3A). The kinetics of induction of mRNAs encoding c-fos and c-jun was delayed in comparison with that of histone H3 modification (compare Figs. 1 and 2 with Fig. 3).

P., and Shakhnovich, E. I. (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 96, 11293–11298) proposed that the conversion mechanism involves critical interactions at helix 1 (residues 144–153) and that the helix is stabilized on PrP-sen by intra-helix salt bridges between two aspartic acid-arginine ion pairs at positions 144 and 148 and at 147 and 151, respectively. Mutants of the hamster prion protein were constructed by replacing the aspartic acids with either asparagines or alanines to destabilize the proposed helix 1 salt bridges. Thermal and chemical denaturation experiments using circular dichroism spectroscopy indicated the overall structures of the mutants are not substantially destabilized but appear to unfold differently. Cell-free conversion reactions performed using ionic denaturants, detergents, and salts (conditions unfavorable to salt bridge formation) showed no significant differences between conversion efficiencies of mutant and wild type proteins. Using conditions more favorable to salt bridge formation, the mutant proteins converted with up to 4-fold higher efficiency than the wild type protein. Thus, although spectroscopic data indicate the salt bridges do not substantially stabilize PrP-sen, the cell-free conversion data suggest that Asp-144 and Asp-147 and their respective salt bridges stabilize PrP-sen from converting to PrP-res.

TSE diseases include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome and kuru in humans; scrapie in sheep, mice, and hamsters; bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle; and chronic wasting disease in deer and elk. PrP-res accumulates as a result of the conversion of the normal, protease-sensitive form of PrP (PrPC or PrP-sen), which occurs as a post-translational process without any apparent requirement for covalent modifications (1Hope J. Morton L.J. Farquhar C.F. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Kimberlin R.H. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2591-2597Google Scholar, 2Stahl N. Baldwin M.A. Teplow D.B. Hood L. Gibson B.W. Burlingame A.L. Prusiner S.B.

Although not yet fully understood, the accumulation of PrP-res appears to lead to cerebral amyloidosis, dementia, motor dysfunction, and eventually death. PrP-res forms insoluble aggregates and is partially resistant to proteinase K (PK), which removes ∼67 amino acid residues (6–7 kDa) from the N terminus (1Hope J. Morton L.J. Farquhar C.F. Multhaup G.

These differences in biophysical properties most likely reflect different conformations of the two protein isoforms. Optical spectroscopic data indicate that PrP-sen isolated from normal brain is highly α-helical, whereas PrP-res contains a large proportion of ॆ-sheet structure (6Pan K.M. Baldwin M. Nguyen J. Gasset M. Serban A. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. Huang Z. Fletterick R.J. Cohen F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10962-10966Google Scholar, 7Caughey B.W. Dong A. Bhat K.S. Ernst D. Hayes S.F.

The conversion of PrP-sen into PrP-res is likely to be the key event in the pathogenesis of TSE diseases. Although TSE diseases may be sporadic, genetic, or infectious in origin, it is commonly argued that, in each circumstance, the disease propagates itself through a self-catalytic mechanism involving existing multimers of PrP-res. This idea is supported by experiments that show that PrP-res can induce the conversion of native PrP into PrP-res-like aggregates in vitro (9Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1994; 370: 471-474Google Scholar, 10Caughey B. Raymond G.J. Callahan M.A. Wong C. Baron G.S. Xiong L.W. Adv. Protein Chem. 2001; 57: 139-169Google Scholar). However, the precise molecular mechanism of the conversion between the normal and pathogenic forms of prion proteins remains poorly understood. Prior to conversion to PrP-res, the structure of PrP-sen (see Fig. 1) consists of a core domain (residues 125–228), containing three α-helices (helix 1, residues 144–154; helix 2, 172–193; and helix 3, 200–227) and two short antiparallel ॆ-strands (residues 129–131 and 161–163), and a largely unstructured N-terminal domain (residues 23–119) (11James T.L. Liu H. Ulyanov N.B. Farr-Jones S. Zhang H. Donne D.G. Kaneko K. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10086-10091Google Scholar).

A. 1995; 92: 11160-11164Google Scholar) suggest that helix 1 (residues 144–153) might be a site of interaction of PrP-sen and PrP-res and that it plays a critical role in the initial stages of PrP-sen unfolding and conversion. Morrissey and Shakhnovich (12Morrissey M.P. Shakhnovich E.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11293-11298Google Scholar) noted that helix 1 is unusually hydrophilic and lacking in non-covalent contacts with the remainder of the protein. They proposed that the stabilization of helix 1 is self-sustaining through the presence of intra-helix electrostatic interactions such as the two properly phased Asp-Arg pairs within the helix, which form strong salt bridges and stabilize the helical turns (Fig. 1) (12Morrissey M.P. Shakhnovich E.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11293-11298Google Scholar). The directional ordering of the charges is expected to interact with the intrinsic dipole moment of the helix providing further stabilization. Molecular modeling studies suggested that the conserved amino acid sequence of hamster PrP helix 1 might favorably adopt conformations necessary to form intermolecular ॆ-sheet aggregates and that these aggregates might be stabilized by intermolecular salt bridges between the helix 1 Asp and Arg residues of adjacent molecules (12Morrissey M.P. Shakhnovich E.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11293-11298Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, Vorberg et al.reported that the deletion of helix 1 from PrP-sen completely inhibited its conversion to PrP-res (31Vorberg I. Chan K. Priola S.A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 10024-10032Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that ade novo α to ॆ conformational change and aggregation of recombinant human PrP occurs in the presence of 1 mguanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) and at pH levels below 5.0 (13Swietnicki W.

A. 1998; 95: 6010-6014Google Scholar, 15Kaneko K. Peretz D. Pan K.M. Blochberger T.C. Wille H. Gabizon R. Griffith O.H. Cohen F.E. Baldwin M.A. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11160-11164Google Scholar). If the non-ionic denaturant urea was used, then the ॆ conversion also required NaCl. It is possible that the protonation of Asp-144 and Asp-147 at low pH interrupts the salt bridges in helix 1 and compromises its stability. The presence of the additional denaturant and salts may also help disrupt the overall structure and stability of the folded protein and screen electrostatic charges that stabilize helix 1. To address the question of the role of helix 1 Asp residues and their salt bridges to Arg residues in the stabilization of PrP-sen and its conversion to PrP-res, we have prepared six mutants replacing Asp-144 and Asp-147 with either asparagines or alanines to eliminate the putative salt bridges. The results indicate that PrP-sen is not substantially stabilized overall by the Asp-Arg salt bridges and that intermolecular salt bridge formation involving the same residues is not essential for the formation of PrP-res. The unfolding pathway of PrP-sen and its conversion to PrP-res, however, are influenced by interactions involving the helix 1 aspartic acid residues. These results provide insight into the basic mechanism of PrP-res formation. The plasmid encoding Syrian hamster PrP (HaPrP) (residues 23–231) was constructed in a pET24a(+) vector from Novagen inserted as an NdeI fragment using standard cloning techniques. Mutations at positions 144, 147, and both 144 and 147 were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. Oligonucleotides used in the mutagenesis were obtained from Genosys Biotechnologies and include the following: (D144N) 5′-GCATTTTGGCAATAACTGGGAGGACCGCTACTACCG-3′ and 5′-CGGTAGTAGCGGT CCTCCCAGTTATTGCCAAAATGC-3′; (D147N) 5′-GCAATGACTGGGAGAACCGCTACTACCGTGAAAAC-3′ and 5′-GTTTTCACGGTAGTAGCGGTTCTCCCAGTCATTGC-3′; (D144N/D147N) 5′-GCATTTT GGCAATAACTGGGAGAACCGGTACTACCG-3′ and 5′-CGGTAGTAGCGGTTCTCCCAGTTATTGCCAAAATGC-3′. Mutant DNA was transformed into XL1-Blue supercompetent cells from Stratagene. Mutant DNA was then purified from overnight cultures using a Wizard Miniprep plasmid purification kit. All constructs were sequenced by MWG Biotech. Plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3) supercompetent cells from Stratagene for PrP protein expression. Recombinant proteins accumulated in cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. D-to-N mutant HaPrP (residues 23–231) in the pET24a(+) vector were subcloned using Bsu36I and StuI restriction sites into full-length HaPrP without the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor in a pBluescript vector generously provided by Dr. Bruce Chesebro. The D-to-A mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the HaPrP pBluescript clone using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. Oligonucleotides were obtained from Genosys Biotechnologies and include the following: (D144A) 5′-GCATTTTGGCAATGCCTGGGAGGACCGCTACTACCG-3′ and 5′-CGGTAGTAGCGGTCCTCCCAGGCATTGCCAAAATGC-3′; (D147A) 5′-GCAATGACTGGGAGGCCCGC TACTACCGTGAAAAC-3′ and 5′-GTTTTCACGGTAGTAGCGGGCCTCCCAGTCATTGC-3′; (D144A/D147A) 5′-GCATTTTGGCAATGCCTGGGAGGCCCGCTACTACCG-3′ and 5′-CGGTAGTAGCGGGCCTCCCAGGCATTGCCAAAATGC-3′. The pBS HaPrP construct lacks the GPI anchor, because the gene lacks the C-terminal GPI attachment sequence (9Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1994; 370: 471-474Google Scholar). The pBS PrP clones were then sequenced with an Applied Biosystems 3700 automated sequencer and subcloned using standard techniques into the pSFF retroviral expression vector using the EcoRI restriction site (16Chesebro B. Wehrly K. Caughey B. Nishio J. Ernst D. Race R. Dev. Biol. Stand. 1993; 80: 131-140Google Scholar). Mixtures of PA317 and ψ2 mouse fibroblast cells were transfected with the pSFF plasmid, including the respective wild type or mutant PrP insert and used for protein expression as described previously (9Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1994; 370: 471-474Google Scholar, 17Robertson M.N. Spangrude G.J. Hasenkrug K. Perry L. Nishio J. Wehrly K. Chesebro B.

Cells ofEscherichia coli BL21(DE3) with the desired PrP construct were grown overnight in 5 ml of NZY liquid culture medium containing 0.05 mg/ml kanamycin. The overnight culture was added to 500 ml of NZY medium with 0.05 mg/ml kanamycin and grown at 37 °C in a shaking incubator to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.5. Protein expression was then induced by adding isopropyl-ॆ-d-thiogalactoside to 0.5 mm to the culture. The induced culture was grown for 2 h at 37 °C in a shaking incubator. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were suspended in lysis buffer (50 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.17 Triton X-100) and sonicated to release the inclusion bodies containing the protein of interest. Inclusion bodies were collected by centrifugation and then solubilized for 2 h in 8 m urea buffered at pH 8 with 0.1 m sodium phosphate and 0.01 m Tris. The solubilized protein solution was then diluted 10-fold with 8.0m urea in TCB buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2). The solubilized protein solution was purified using Novagen His-Bind resin. The resin was incubated with the solubilized protein in 8 murea for 2 h. The protein-bound resin was loaded onto the column and washed with a 2 m step gradient from 8 to 0m urea in TCB. The protein was eluted using 60 mm imidazole in TCB followed by 200 mmimidazole in TCB. Fractions were analyzed using SDS-PAGE to confirm the presence of PrP (molecular mass, 23-kDa). Fractions containing only PrP were pooled and dialyzed against 0.01 m sodium phosphate at pH 6.0 to remove the imidazole and then concentrated using a centrifugal filter device (molecular mass cut-off, 10 kDa) to ∼0.5 mg/ml final protein concentration (ε280 = 2.7 ml mg−1 cm−1). No impurities were seen in the final protein preparations using SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Molecular masses for all purified protein constructs were confirmed using MALDI mass spectrometry. The molecular masses for the D144N, D147N, and D144N/D147N mutants were 0.95, 0.82, and 1.89 atomic mass units lower, respectively, than the wild type protein, consistent with the respective theoretical molecular masses. Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was performed using an On-line Instrument Systems (Olis) CD module with a Cary-16 spectrophotometer conversion unit with a NESLAB RTE-111 temperature control module. For thermal denaturation experiments the ellipticity from 225 to 207.5 nm of PrP samples at 0.3 mg/ml in 0.01 mNaPO4 at pH 6.0 was measured at intervals between 25 and 72.5 °C. Full spectra at 25, 62.5, and 72.5 °C were scanned from 185 to 260 nm. Samples were scanned three times with a 0.5-nm scanning interval in a 1.0-mm cylindrical cell after equilibrating 15 min at the desired temperature. Scans were averaged using the Olis spectral processing software supplied with the instrument. The fraction of unfolded protein for each construct was determined using the molar ellipticity at 222 nm and was plotted versus the temperature in degrees Celsius. The ellipticity at 72.5 °C was used for the unfolded protein ellipticity. All of the mutant protein signals were normalized to the wild type PrP unfolded signal. Averages and standard deviations of transition midpoints and slopes were determined from three individual experiments for each protein. For the GdnHCl denaturation experiments, samples from 0 to 5.0m GdnHCl were prepared by diluting a stock PrP solution (0.3 mg/ml) with varying amounts of a stock 8.0 m GdnHCl solution and buffer giving a final protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. All solutions were buffered at pH 6.0 in 0.01 mNaPO4. Samples were allowed to equilibrate for at least 1 h prior to analysis. Samples were scanned three times in a 1.0-mm cylindrical cell from 225 to 207.5 nm with a 0.5-nm scanning interval at 25 °C. All spectral data were corrected for absorbance by the buffer and denaturant. The fraction of unfolded protein was determined for each construct using the ellipticity at 222 nm. Averages and ranges for the thermodynamic parameters were determined from two individual experiments for each protein. Thermal and GdnHCl denaturation curves were fit using the non-linear regression analysis tool on GraphPad Prism. Thermal unfolding transition midpoints and GdnHCl denaturation thermodynamic parameters were determined assuming a two-state unfolding process as described by Pace and Scholtz (19Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M. Creighton T.E. 2nd Ed. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1997: 299-321Google Scholar). Plots of ΔG0versus GdnHCl concentration were fit by linear regression according to the equation, ΔG0 = ΔG(H2O) −m[GdnHCl], where ΔG0 is the standard Gibbs free energy, ΔG(H2O) is the Gibbs free energy of unfolding in the absence of denaturant,m is the cooperativity of unfolding, and [GdnHCl] is the concentration of GdnHCl in molarity. Metabolic labeling of PA317 and ψ2 mouse fibroblast cells with the wild type or mutant PrP pSFF clones was performed as described previously (20Kocisko D.A. Priola S.A. Raymond G.J. Chesebro B.

Demaimay R. Raymond G.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 122-133Google Scholar). Lysis and extraction of PrP from cells was then performed as described previously (23Caughey B. Raymond G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18217-18223Google Scholar, 24Caughey B. Kocisko D.A. Raymond G.J. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 807-817Google Scholar). The protein was immunoprecipitated using the mouse 3F4 monoclonal antibody as described previously (24Caughey B. Kocisko D.A. Raymond G.J. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 807-817Google Scholar). PrP-res from 263K scrapie-infected hamsters was prepared using a revision of the Boltonet al. method (25Bolton D.C. Bendheim P.E. Marmorstein A.D. Potempska A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 258: 579-590Google Scholar) and was stored in 0.57 sulfobetaine (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA, Zwittergent 3–14) in phosphate-buffered saline as described previously (9Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1994; 370: 471-474Google Scholar, 20Kocisko D.A. Priola S.A. Raymond G.J. Chesebro B. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Caughey B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3923-3927Google Scholar). Crude normal and 263K-infected hamster brain microsomes were prepared as described previously (26Baron G.S. Wehrly K. Dorward D.W. Chesebro B. Caughey B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1031-1040Google Scholar). Two different cell-free reaction conditions were used: 1) reactions using purified PrP-res pretreated with 2 m GdnHCl for 1 h at 37 °C and 2) reactions using PrP-res in brain microsomes. Cell-free conversion reactions in the presence of GdnHCl using purified PrP-res and reactions without detergents and denaturants using microsomal PrP-res were performed as described previously (9Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1994; 370: 471-474Google Scholar, 21Horiuchi M. Caughey B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3193-3203Google Scholar,24Caughey B.

Each reaction contained 100 ng of 263K PrP-res mixed with 10,000 to 20,000 cpm of [35S]PrP-sen. For reactions using GdnHCl pretreated PrP-res final reaction mixtures also contained 364 mm GdnHCl, 34 mm Sarkosyl, 1.25 mmsulfabetaine, 5 nm hexadecylpyridinium chloride, and 50 mm sodium citrate at pH 6.0. For conversions using microsomal PrP-res, final reaction mixtures also contained 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm sodium citrate at pH 6.0. Reactions were incubated for 40–48 h at 37 °C. After incubation, 907 of the reaction mixture was treated with 20 ॖg/ml PK at 37 °C for 1 h. The remaining 107 was analyzed without PK treatment. The PK digestion was stopped by adding Pefabloc (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to 2 mm, 20 ॖg of thyroglobulin as a carrier protein, and four volumes of methanol. Precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation and separated by SDS-PAGE using Novex NuPAGE pre-cast polyacrylamide gels. Radioactive proteins were visualized and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). To investigate the roles of the helix 1 Asp residues and their proposed salt bridges on the stability of the secondary structure of PrP, three mutant proteins (D144N, D147N, and D144N/D147N) of full-length hamster PrP (residues 23–231) were expressed as cytoplasmic inclusion bodies inEscherichia coli, purified, and refolded for analysis by circular dichroism spectroscopy. The purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to assess protein purity and the presence of the disulfide bond between Cys179 and Cys 214 (Fig. 2). The slower migration of the proteins on SDS-PAGE upon treatment with ॆ-mercaptoethanol (lanes 1–4) than untreated samples (lanes 5–8) indicated that the disulfide bond was present in the untreated preparations of each construct (27Rezaei H. Marc D. Choiset Y. Takahashi M. Hui Bon H.G. Haertle T. Grosclaude J. Debey P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2833-2839Google Scholar). Each protein ran as a single band with an estimated purity of at least 907. The secondary structures and stabilities of the PrP mutants relative to wild type PrP were assessed by CD spectroscopy. Under non-denaturing conditions at 25 °C and pH 6.0 (the optimal pH for most PrP-res-induced cell-free conversion reactions), spectra of the wild type and mutant PrP constructs (Fig.3a) were identical, each showing negative lobes at 208 and 222 nm indicative of highly α-helical secondary structures as has been seen previously for PrP-sen derived from brain (6Pan K.M. Baldwin M. Nguyen J. Gasset M. Serban A. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. Huang Z. Fletterick R.J. Cohen F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10962-10966Google Scholar), mammalian tissue culture cells (28Xiong L.W. Raymond L.D. Hayes S.F. Raymond G.J. Caughey B. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 669-678Google Scholar), and recombinant PrP synthesized and refolded from inclusion bodies (29Hornemann S. Korth C. Oesch B. Riek R. Wider G. Wuthrich K. Glockshuber R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 277-281Google Scholar). These data suggest the Asp residues and their respective salt bridges do not substantially stabilize helix 1. Thermal denaturation was performed to determine if the mutants were destabilized with respect to secondary structure and unfolding transitions. The thermal denaturation curves were sigmoidal for all constructs, suggesting that they undergo a two-state unfolding transition (Fig. 3b). However, none of the thermal unfolding reactions for the PrP constructs were reversible; thus, thermodynamic values could not be obtained. Transition midpoints and slopes of the unfolding transition regions were used for comparison instead. The transition midpoints (TableI) for the mutants were within 2.2 °C of the wild type protein transition midpoint suggesting that the PrP secondary structure is not substantially destabilized by the mutations and the presumed elimination of the helix 1 salt bridges. However, the slopes of the transition regions of the mutant unfolding curves (TableI) were lower than the slope of the wild type protein unfolding curve. These data indicate that the mutants unfold differently and less cooperatively than the wild type protein.Table IThermodynamic parameters for thermal and GdnHCl denaturation of wild type and helix 1 mutant hamster PrP proteinConstructTmSlopeΔG(H2O)[GdnHCl]12m°C°C−1kJ mol−1mkJ mol−1m−1Wild type61.3 ± 0.70.174 ± 0.01616.0 ± 5.42.02 ± 0.087.9 ± 2.3D144N63.5 ± 0.30.112 ± 0.00813.7 ± 1.61.84 ± 0.027.4 ± 1.0D147N62.9 ± 0.40.139 ± 0.00815.1 ± 1.61.93 ± 0.087.9 ± 0.5D144N/D147N61.0 ± 0.50.0986 ± 0.00510.9 ± 1.91.80 ± 0.096.0 ± 0.8Transition midpoints (Tm) and slope values (means ± S.D.) were determined from three individual thermal denaturation experiments for each protein.

ΔG(H2O), m, and [GdnHCl]12 values (means ± range) were determined from two individual denaturation experiments using GdnHCl for each protein. To look more closely at the thermal denaturation differences between the wild type and mutant PrP molecules, CD spectra at 62.5 °C, 72.5 °C, and, 25 °C after cooling from 72.5 °C, were overlaid (Fig. 3, c–e). The wild type protein changed from a highly α-helical conformation at 25 °C (Fig. 3a) to a highly ॆ-sheet conformation at 62.5 and 72.5 °C as indicated by the negative peak centered at 215 nm (Fig. 3, c andd). At 62.5 °C all three mutants appeared to still have some α-helical content judging by the slight negative dips in ellipticity at 208 and 222 nm (Fig. 3c). At 72.5 °C the mutant spectra all had negative lobes around 204 nm different from the wild type spectrum, most noticeable in the D144N and D144N/D147N mutant spectra (Fig. 3d). This difference indicated that the mutant proteins have different states of denaturation at 72.5 °C than the wild type. Negative ellipticities below 200 nm are associated with disordered structure; thus, the mutant PrP conformations appeared to contain more disordered structure than the more ॆ-sheet-containing wild type protein. In addition to the conformational differences at 72.5 °C, there were differences in the reversibilities of the unfolding induced by this temperature. Thermal denaturation of the wild type protein was highly irreversible, which has been shown previously (30Jackson G.S. Hill A.F. Joseph C. Hosszu L. Power A. Waltho J.P. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1431: 1-13Google Scholar), as can be seen by the fact that the spectra at 72.5 and 25 °C after cooling from 72.5 °C are shaped similarly with main negative lobes for both spectra centered close to 215 nm (Fig. 3, dand e). Spectra of the mutant PrP molecules after cooling from 72.5 °C to 25 °C showed a partial change back to more α-helical spectra with the D144N and D144N/D147N spectra, in particular, showing negative lobes at 208 and 222 nm (Fig.3e), which are similar to, but not identical to the spectra at 25 °C prior to thermal denaturation (Fig. 3a). These data suggest the mutant proteins unfold to a different denatured state structure at 72.5 °C than the wild type protein. To further investigate the unfolding of the PrP helix 1 mutants, GdnHCl unfolded samples of wild type D144N, D147N, and D144N/D147N PrP at pH 6.0 were monitored using CD spectroscopy at 222 nm. As shown in Fig.4, the sigmoid shapes of the unfolding curves indicated that all the constructs underwent a cooperative two-state transition. All unfolding reactions were found to be reversible (data not shown). Thermodynamic parameters, determined from the unfolding data assuming a two-state transition, are shown in TableI. The wild type protein had a free energy of conformation ((ΔG(H2O)) similar to that for recombinant full-length ovine PrP (27Rezaei H. Marc D. Choiset Y. Takahashi M. Hui Bon H.G. Haertle T.

https://openalex.org/W2113602208,"The pathways of hepatic intra- and peri-cellular lipidation of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) were studied by infecting primary mouse hepatocytes from either apoA-I-deficient or ABCA1-deficient mice with a recombinant adenovirus expressing the human apoA-I (hapoA-I) cDNA (endo apoA-I) or incubating the hepatocytes with exogenously added hapoA-I (exo apoA-I) and examining the hapoA-I-containing lipoproteins formed. The cells, maintained in serum-free medium, were labeled with [3H]choline, and the cell medium was separated by fast protein liquid chromatography or immunoprecipitated to quantify labeled choline phospholipids specifically associated with hapoA-I.

However, the lipoprotein size and electrophoretic mobility and phospholipid profiles were similar for exo apoA-I and endo apoA-I. Taken together, these data demonstrate that a significant proportion of hapoA-I is secreted from hepatocytes in a phospholipidated state but that hapoA-I is also phospholipidated peri-cellularly. With primary hepatocytes from ABCA1-deficient mice, the expression and net secretion of adenoviral-generated endogenous apoA-I was unchanged compared with control mice, but3H-phospholipids associated with endo apoA-I and exo apoA-I decreased by 63 and 25%, respectively. The lipoprotein size and electrophoretic migration and their phospholipid profiles remained unchanged. In conclusion, we demonstrated that intracellular and peri-cellular lipidation of apoA-I represent distinct and additive pathways that may be regulated independently. Hepatocyte expression of ABCA1 is central to the lipidation of newly synthesized apoA-I but also contributes to the lipidation of exogenous apoA-I.

This was first interpreted as evidence that excess lipids accumulated in scavenger receptor-expressing cells were a major source of HDL lipids (20Hayden M.R. Clee S.M. Brooks-Wilson A. Genest Jr., J.

This suggests that in both liver and intestine, where apoA-I synthesis is also high, ABCA1 may contribute to the lipidation of newly secreted or nascent lipoproteins. Previously, work with hepatocytes from chicken (23Banerjee D. Redman C.M. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 24Banerjee D. Redman C.M. J.

Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 833-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) had suggested that apoA-I was lipidated intracellularly. However, Hamilton et al. (26Hamilton R.L. Moorehouse A. Havel R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 529-543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using electron microscopy, failed to identify any lipidated apoA-I particles in hepatocytes, putting the intracellular lipidation hypothesis in dispute. Recently, Chisholm et al. (27Chisholm J.W. Burleson E.R. Shelness G.S. Parks J.S. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 36-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) investigated the secretion and lipidation of apoA-I from HepG2 cells. They concluded that some apoA-I acquired lipid intracellularly and was then secreted along with lipid-poor apoA-I. Subsequently, the secreted apoA-I could acquire lipids extracellularly to form buoyant HDL particles. In those studies, which support the model of intracellular lipidation of apoA-I, HDL particles were obtained by carbonate extraction of cell homogenates. Despite careful quantitation and inclusion of controls, mixing of cell contents and artificial lipidation of apoA-I may occur. Here we have characterized the hepatic lipidation of apoA-I by using adenoviral expression of human apoA-I (hapoA-I) (28McManus D.C. Scott B.R. Frank P.G. Franklin V. Schultz J.R. Marcel Y.L. J.

We also characterized the nascent lipoproteins formed by primary hepatocytes cultured in lipoprotein-free medium compared with those formed by interaction of exogenous apoA-I with the same cells. In both conditions hepatocytes generate a lipidated pool of apoA-I-containing lipoproteins via a pathway dependent on ABCA1. However, the lipidation of apoA-I is reduced but not abolished in experiments with ABCA1-deficient hepatocytes, suggesting the existence of alternate lipidation pathways. ApoA-I-deficient (Apoa1tm1Unc) C57BL/6J mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). ABCA1-deficient mice were generated according to Hamon et al. (30Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciani M.F. Toti F. Chaslin S. Freyssinet J.M. Devaux P.F. McNeish J. Marguet D. Chimini G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). The mice were maintained on a 12 h light/12 h dark schedule on a normal chow diet. Primary hepatocytes were prepared from these mice according to established protocols (31Subrahmanyan L. Kisilevsky R. Scand. J. Immunol. 1988; 27: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 32Thomas S.S. Plenkiewicz J. Ison E.R. Bols M. Zou W. Szarek W.A. Kisilevsky R. Biochim. Biophys.

Briefly, the cells were seeded in fibronectin-coated (25 μg/well) 6-well plates at an initial density of 1–2 × 106 cells per well in William's medium containing penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin sulfate (100 units/ml), Fungizone® (250 ng/ml; Invitrogen) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). Six h following the initial plating, the cells were washed in William's medium without fetal bovine serum (2 × 2 ml) and incubated with Hepatozyme® medium (Invitrogen) containing 10 μCi/well of [3H]choline (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The following day (24 h) the labeled medium was removed and the cells were infected for 1 h with either the recombinant hapoA-I encoding Ad5 adenovirus (AdAI) or luciferase adenovirus (AdLuc) at a multiplicity of infection of 75:1 plaque-forming units per cell in William's medium without fetal bovine serum (28McManus D.C.

Sparks D.L. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21292-21302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). After the 1 h infection, the hepatocytes were incubated for an additional 24 h with fresh labeling medium as described above. The third day (18–24 h after adenovirus infection), following 2 × 2 ml washes in non-radioactive medium, the cells were incubated with unlabeled Hepatozyme® medium (1 ml per well) in the absence or presence of 5 μg of hapoA-I. The cells were returned to the 37 °C incubator (5% CO2) for 3.5 h, and the medium was subsequently collected and spun down to pellet any cell debris. The medium with newly secreted apoA-I (AdAI-infected cells) or with exogenously added hapoA-I (AdLuc-infected cells) was analyzed as described below. In some experiments, 10 μm 9-cis-retinoic acid, a retinoid X receptor (RXR) ligand, was added to the hepatocytes 12 h prior to and during the 3.5 h incubation. Glyburide (100 μm), a known inhibitor of ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux, was added only during the 3.5 h incubation. The medium from four 6-well plates (24 wells) were pooled and concentrated down to 2 ml (12-fold concentrated with Amicon 10K filter units). The samples were immediately loaded on two calibrated Superdex 200 columns connected in a series similar to that described previously for isolation of lipoproteins from plasma samples (28McManus D.C.

Very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)- and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-sized species elute in the void volume on these columns. HDL2/3particles and smaller very high density lipoprotein (VHDL) fractions containing albumin (≤ 7.1 nm diameter) were carefully separated. Aliquots (200 μl) from each fraction were analyzed for apoA-I by Western blot analysis following transfer to nitrocellulose with a slot blot apparatus (BioRad Bio-Dot SF unit) as described previously (28McManus D.C.

No background signal could be detected as indicated by analysis of medium collected from hepatocytes infected with the AdLuc. The relative distribution of apoA-I in the VLDL, HDL2/3, and VHDL pools was determined by densitometric scanning (BioRad software, Quantity One, version 4.11). For comparison, the relative distribution of murine apoB (apoB48 and apoB100) was also measured using a polyclonal anti-mouse apoB antibody (BIODESIGN International, Kennebunk, ME) and visualized by chemiluminescence (Pierce West Pico SuperSignal substrate, Pierce) after incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences). The charge and size of apoA-I secreted from the primary hepatocytes was determined by agarose gel (Beckman Lipogel, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) and 4–20% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis (PAGGE) (Novex, Invitrogen), respectively, as described previously (28McManus D.C.

Sparks D.L. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21292-21302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, following transfer of proteins from the gels to nitrocellulose, the membranes were probed with biotinylated monoclonal antibodies directed against human apoA-I (a combination of 4H1 (against the extreme N terminus) and 5F6 (against the central region)) (33Marcel Y.L. Provost P.R. Koa H. Raffai E. Dac N.V. Fruchart J.C. Rassart E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3644-3653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antibodies were biotinylated with Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Pierce) and visualized by chemiluminescence following treatment with Streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). The size of the apoA-I species were compared with biotinylated molecular weight markers of known hydrodynamic diameter, and the charge of secreted apoA-I was compared with lipid-free apoA-I and HDL both isolated from human plasma. ApoA-I secreted from hepatocytes was immunoprecipitated under native conditions either directly from the medium or from lipoprotein fractions isolated by FPLC as follows. The immunoprecipitations were carried out with a polyclonal anti-human apoA-I antiserum from sheep (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). An equal volume of an anti-human apoB antiserum from sheep, which does not cross-react with murine apoB, was used as a control where indicated. The immunoprecipitates were collected following centrifugation (10 min at 3000 ×g) and washed three times with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (no detergents) and resuspended in a final volume of 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. These immunoprecipitates were either subjected directly to scintillation counting or were further analyzed by Bligh and Dyer lipid extraction (34Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) and thin layer chromatography (TLC). TLC separation was performed on silica gel plates and a solvent system (chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/formic acid/water, 70:30:12:4:2) for separation of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin. The TLC bands corresponding to phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin were excised and counted for radioactivity. Alternatively, cells were labeled with 32P-phosphate (Amersham Biosciences) to label all cellular phospholipids. Cells were treated as with labeling with [3H]choline, except that32P-phosphate in Hepatozyme medium was only added after adenoviral infection on the second day (not also on the first day as for [3H]choline). On the third day, the hepatocytes were washed as before and incubated in fresh Hepatozyme in the absence or presence of apoA-I for 3.5 h. The hapoA-I-containing lipoproteins were immunoprecipitated as described above, and then phospholipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (34Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). The phospholipids were separated by TLC in the solvent system of chloroform, methanol, acetic acid, formic acid, water (at a volume ratio of 70:30:12:4:2). The TLC plate was exposed to a phosphorimaging plate and the relative amounts of phospholipids were determined by densitometry scanning (BioRad software, Quantity One, version 4.11). Results are expressed as the average of at least three replicates to control for variable loading and extraction efficiency. Lipidation of a newly synthesized apoA-I can occur both intracellularly during transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface and peri-cellularly through lipid efflux. To document the relative contribution to the lipidation observed, we compared endogenously synthesized apoA-I and exogenously added apoA-I. Primary hepatocytes were isolated from 4–6-month-old mice by liver collagenase perfusion, and isolated cells were cultured on fibronectin-coated plates in the presence of serum-free media (Hepatozyme). The following day, cells were infected with either an adenoviral construct encoding human apoA-I (AdAI) or luciferase (AdLuc) for 1 h, washed, and then returned to Hepatozyme media. The next day, the cells were washed and then incubated with fresh Hepatozyme media in the absence or presence of exogenous hapoA-I for 3.5 h. This time period was chosen to allow sufficient secretion of hapoA-I for analysis, and yet minimize peri-cellular interactions. We chose a concentration of exo apoA-I that approximated the amount of hapoA-I secreted during the same time period. The hapoA-I-containing lipoproteins in the media were then analyzed by a number of methods. The adenoviral vector was selected specifically to ensure apoA-I synthesis and secretion independent of experimental factors. The electrophoretic migration on agarose gels of hapoA-I newly secreted from primary hepatocytes (hereafter referred to as endogenously synthesized apoA-I or “endo apoA-I”) or exogenously added hapoA-I (referred to as “exo apoA-I”) was assessed (Fig.1). Endo apoA-I and exo apoA-I from apoA-I-deficient mice were both found to have exclusively pre-β migration, and no α-migrating immunoreactive apoA-I band appeared even with prolonged exposure. This is in contrast with a previous study in monkey hepatocytes (4Castle C.K. Pape M.E. Marotti K.R. Melchior G.W. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 439-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where apoA-I-containing lipoproteins were found to segregate into two pre-β- and one α-migrating fractions. Similarly, lipoproteins formed by hepatocytes from ABCA1−/− mice endo apoA-I or exo apoA-I (Fig. 1) possessed only pre-β migration. This result demonstrates that all HDL formed, whatever the source, have similar pre-β electrophoretic mobility, and thereby lack a significant hydrophobic core. To evaluate the lipoprotein size distribution of apoA-I secreted by the hepatocytes expressing hapoA-I, the medium was concentrated and immediately fractionated by FPLC and analyzed. The distribution of immunoreactive human apoA-I and murine apoB (both apoB100 and apoB48) in the FPLC fractions were analyzed by slot blot. Immunoreactive hapoA-I segregated into 3 well separated peaks (Fig.2 A). The largest apoA-I-containing lipoproteins eluted at a position previously calibrated for VLDL (fractions 10–14). This fraction also overlapped with the largest peak of murine apoB-containing lipoproteins (fractions 9–13; data not shown). The second peak of immunoreactive apoA-I-containing lipoproteins eluted at the position of HDL2/3 (fractions 19–23) and the third corresponded to lipid-poor VHDL and apoA-I (fractions 25–29). The results presented are representative of three separate experiments. The distribution of immunoreactive apoA-I after FPLC separation of medium lipoproteins shows that endo apoA-I and exo apoA-I form lipoproteins of similar sizes ranging from VLDL/LDL to VHDL (see Fig.2, A and B, and the distribution obtained with control hepatocytes in Fig. 3,A and B). Furthermore, when exo apoA-I was added to the medium of hepatocytes infected with AdAI, the amount of label associated with apoA-I was additive (data not shown). This result clearly indicates that lipidation occurs both peri-cellularly and intracellularly. ABCA1+/+ control and ABCA1−/− mouse hepatocytes were also infected with AdAI or AdLuc and then analyzed by FPLC for size separation of the endo apoA-I- and exo apoA-I-containing lipoproteins. Comparing the FPLC profiles of hapoA-I-containing lipoproteins from control and ABCA1-deficient hepatocytes, a reduction can be seen in the proportion of hapoA-I found in the buoyant VLDL and HDL fractions for both endo apoA-I (Fig. 3 A) and exo apoA-I (Fig. 3 B). These results demonstrate the important contribution of ABCA1 to both intracellular and peri-cellular lipidation of apoA-I. The different apoA-I-containing lipoprotein populations generated by the primary hepatocytes and separated by FPLC (VLDL, HDL, and VHDL) were further analyzed by non-denaturing PAGGE and Western blot analysis (Fig. 4). Similar amounts of immunoreactive hapoA-I were loaded from each lipoprotein pool. The same lipoprotein pool for different hepatocyte samples was similarly concentrated and loaded. The endo apoA-I present in VLDL (lane 1), HDL2/3 (lane 2), and VHDL fractions (lane 3) are well separated from one another. The HDL2/3 and lipid-poor apoA-I yield distinct bands, which are compatible with the known formation of lipoproteins with varying numbers of apoA-I and with varying degrees of lipidation. A large amount of hapoA-I is secreted as HDL2/3-sized species (Fig.2 A), with a significant size heterogeneity, which in this pool can reach 10.4 nm (Fig. 4, lane 2). The three lipoprotein fractions from the media of AdLuc-infected hepatocytes incubated with exo apoA-I (Fig. 2 B) were also analyzed by non-denaturing PAGGE: VLDL (lane 4), HDL (lane 5), and VHDL (lane 6). Interestingly, in comparison to endo apoA-I, lipidation of exo apoA-I produced profiles of similarly as well as differently sized hapoA-I-containing lipoproteins (comparinglanes 2 and 5 and 3 and 6). This suggests differences in how endo apoA-I and exo apoA-I lipoproteins are speciated and lipidated; it also indicates that our experiments distinguish between lipidation associated with secretion and efflux. Furthermore, when hepatocytes infected with AdLuc and incubated with exo apoA-I were incubated with 9-cis-retinoic acid, a retinoid X receptor ligand, the resulting hapoA-I-containing lipoproteins, VLDL (lane 7), HDL (lane 8), and VHDL (lane 9), were similar to control exo apoA-I fractions. An increased amount of larger-sized HDL particles is evident, suggesting that 9-cis-retinoic acid can enhance lipidation of exogenous hapoA-I. The 9-cis-retinoic acid effect was not observed with endo apoA-I (data not shown). Non-denaturing PAGGE and Western blot analysis were performed on the hapoA-I-containing lipoprotein fractions generated by ABCA1+/+ control and ABCA1−/− hepatocytes (Fig. 5). VLDL (lane 1), HDL (lane 2), and VHDL (lane 3) from control hepatocytes incubated with exo apoA-I are identical to VLDL (lane 7), HDL (lane 8), and VHDL (lane 9) from exo apoA-I in ABCA1−/− hepatocytes. Similarly, for endo apoA-I, the VLDL (lane 4), HDL (lane 5), and VHDL (lane 6) for the control hepatocytes were very similar to the VLDL (lane 10), HDL (lane 11) and VHDL (lane 12) from ABCA1−/− hepatocytes. We know that the quantity of hapoA-I found in VLDL and HDL fractions is significantly reduced in ABCA1−/− hepatocytes (Fig. 3,A and B), but, importantly, the nature of the lipoprotein particles formed is unchanged. From the apoA-I-deficient hepatocytes, the calculated relative distribution of endo apoA-I in the different lipoprotein fractions is shown in Fig.6 A. Interestingly, ∼20% of the total endo apoA-I secreted was found in HDL2/3-sized fractions. As well, a smaller but significant percentage of secreted apoA-I was also found associated with the VLDL pool. This result is in good general agreement with previous results in monkey hepatocytes (4Castle C.K. Pape M.E. Marotti K.R. Melchior G.W. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 439-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in HepG2 cells, although the latter do not secrete VLDL and therefore have no apoA-I-containing lipoproteins in this lipoprotein size (27Chisholm J.W.

Whether the cADPR signaling pathway is common to agonists acting through different G protein-coupled receptors is not known. Using digital video imaging of Fura2-AM loaded porcine airway smooth muscle cells, we examined the effects of the membrane-permeant cADPR antagonist, 8-bromo-cADPR (8Br-cADPR), on the [Ca2+]i responses to ACh, histamine and endothelin-1 (ET-1). In cells preincubated with 100 microM 8Br-cADPR, the [Ca2+]i responses to ACh and ET-1 were significantly attenuated, whereas responses to histamine were not, suggesting agonist specificity of cADPR signaling. The effects of 8Br-cADPR were concentration dependent. We further examined whether muscarinic receptor subtypes specifically couple to this pathway, because in porcine airway smooth muscle cells, ACh activates both M2 and M3 muscarinic receptors coupled to Gai and Gaq, respectively. Methoctramine, an M2-selective antagonist, attenuated the [Ca2+]i responses to Ach, and there was no further attenuation by 8Br-cADPR. In airway smooth muscle, the CD38/cADPR signaling pathway is involved in [Ca2+]i responses to contractile agonists in an agonist-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W1983464103,"In an object-centered representation, the position of the subparts of an object are encoded with respect to a set of axes and an origin centered on the object. Several physiological and neuropsychological results support the existence of such representations in humans and monkeys. An explicit representation would involve neurons with invariant response properties in object-centered coordinates. We consider an alternative scheme using basis functions in which the cells have retinotopic receptive fields modulated by the orientation of the object and task-related signals. We show that this alternative is consistent with single-cell data, is computationally efficient, and accounts for object-centered hemineglect, a syndrome observed in humans after fronto-parietal lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2166196909,"The Rho family of small GTPases, including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, play essential roles in diverse cellular functions. The ability of Rho family GTPases to participate in signaling events is determined by the ratio of inactive (GDP-bound) and active (GTP-bound) forms in the cell. The activation of Rho family proteins requires the exchange of bound GDP for GTP, a process catalyzed by the Dbl family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). The GEFs have high affinity for the guanine nucleotide-free state of the GTPases and are thought to promote GDP release by stabilizing an intermediate transition state. In this study, we have identified and characterized a new Rac/Cdc42-specific Dbl family guanine nucleotide exchange factor, named GEFT. GEFT is highly expressed in the excitable tissues, including brain, heart, and muscle. Low or very little expression was detected in other nonexcitable tissues. GEFT has specific exchange activity for Rac and Cdc42 in our in vitro GTPase exchange assays and glutathione S-transferase-PAK pull-down assays with GTP-bound Rac1 and Cdc42. Overexpression of GEFT leads to changes in cell morphology and actin cytoskeleton re-organization, including the formation of membrane microspikes, filopodia, and lamilliopodia. Furthermore, expression of GEFT in NIH3T3 cells promotes foci formation, cell proliferation, and cell migration, possibly through the activation of transcriptional factors involved in cell growth and proliferation. Together, our data suggest that GEFT is a Rac/Cdc42-specific GEF protein that regulates cell morphology, cell proliferation, and transformation. The Rho family of small GTPases, including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, play essential roles in diverse cellular functions. The ability of Rho family GTPases to participate in signaling events is determined by the ratio of inactive (GDP-bound) and active (GTP-bound) forms in the cell. The activation of Rho family proteins requires the exchange of bound GDP for GTP, a process catalyzed by the Dbl family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). The GEFs have high affinity for the guanine nucleotide-free state of the GTPases and are thought to promote GDP release by stabilizing an intermediate transition state. In this study, we have identified and characterized a new Rac/Cdc42-specific Dbl family guanine nucleotide exchange factor, named GEFT. GEFT is highly expressed in the excitable tissues, including brain, heart, and muscle. Low or very little expression was detected in other nonexcitable tissues. GEFT has specific exchange activity for Rac and Cdc42 in our in vitro GTPase exchange assays and glutathione S-transferase-PAK pull-down assays with GTP-bound Rac1 and Cdc42. Overexpression of GEFT leads to changes in cell morphology and actin cytoskeleton re-organization, including the formation of membrane microspikes, filopodia, and lamilliopodia. Furthermore, expression of GEFT in NIH3T3 cells promotes foci formation, cell proliferation, and cell migration, possibly through the activation of transcriptional factors involved in cell growth and proliferation. Together, our data suggest that GEFT is a Rac/Cdc42-specific GEF protein that regulates cell morphology, cell proliferation, and transformation.

Among the 18 known mammalian members of the Ras superfamily, Rho A, Rac1, and Cdc42 are the most studied and well characterized. Each of the three members has a distinct function in cell actin cytoskeleton organization and responses (6Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). For example, Rho has been shown to regulate the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesion in fibroblasts (6Takai Y.

Similar to all members of the Ras superfamily proteins, the GTP-binding/GTP hydrolysis cycle of Rho family proteins is tightly controlled. The ability of Rho family GTPases to participate in signaling events is determined by the ratio of GTP/GDP-bound forms in the cell. Like all GTPases, they exist in an inactive (GDP-bound) and an active (GTP-bound) conformation. The activation of Rho family proteins requires the exchange of bound GDP for GTP, a process catalyzed by the Dbl family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and other specific GEFs (27Zheng Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 724-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 28Schmidt A. Hall A.

Like the ligand-activated seven-transmembrane receptors in activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins, the GEFs have high affinity for the guanine nucleotide-free state of the GTPases and are thought to promote GDP release by stabilizing an intermediate transition state (28Schmidt A.

All Dbl family proteins consist of a Dbl homology (DH) domain (∼200 amino acid residues) and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (∼100 amino acid residues) immediately COOH-terminal to the DH domain (27Zheng Y.

Recent studies have determined the structure of the DH and PH domains of Tiam-1 bound to nucleotide-free Rac1 and the potential mechanism to stimulate guanine nucleotide exchange of Rho GTPases by Dbl family GEFs (30Karnoub A.E.

Nature. 2000; 408: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). PH domains have been found and invariably follow the DH domain in the Dbl family of proteins. PH domain contains ∼100 amino acids and has been found in a number of proteins (40Rebecchi M.J. Scarlata S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

Although DH-associated PH domains promote the translocation of Dbl-related proteins to plasma membranes (42Whitehead I.P. Khosravi-Far R. Kirk H. Trigo-Gonzalez G. Der C.J. Kay R. J. Biol.

Two of the well characterized effectors of Rac/Cdc42 GTPases are the PAK family of serine/threonine kinases and the WASP proteins. In response to physiological stimuli, the active GTP-bound Rac and Cdc42 interact with the p21 (Rac/Cdc42)-binding domain of PAK, resulting in PAK autophosphorylation and increased kinase activity, and downstream activation of a variety of cellular functions (22Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar, 46Frost J.A. Swantek J.L. Stippec S. Yin M.J. Gaynor R. Cobb M.H. J. Biol.

Activation of the WASP protein by GTP-bound Cdc42 leads to the signaling cascades mediated by the WASP protein, resulting in the polymerization of cytoskeletal actin filaments (51Takenawa T. Miki H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1801-1809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52Thrasher A.J. Burns S. Lorenzi R. Jones G.E. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 178: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Therefore, interaction between the Rac/Cdc42 and their effectors are reversible and are dependent on the GTP/GDP binding states of the Rac and Cdc42 GTPases. In this study, we have identified a guanine nucleotide exchange factor in both human and mouse, named GEFT, a member of the Dbl family proteins. GEFT is highly expressed in the excitable tissues, such as brain, heart, and muscle. The protein exhibited potent guanine nucleotide exchange activity on Rac1 and Cdc42, whereas little activity was observed on RhoA. Overexpression of GEFT in NIH3T3 cells caused transformed phenotypes similar to the activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 by Vav. Furthermore, expression of GEFT induces the formation of lamellipodia, actin microspikes, and filopodia, similar to the activation of Rac and Cdc42 proteins. In addition, GEFT also stimulates the transcriptional activities of SRE, Elk1, and the c-Jun transcription factors. Taken together, our data suggest that GEFT is a specific activator preferentially for Rac1 and Cdc42 GTPases and may play important roles in cell morphology, growth, and proliferation. The mouse GEFT fragment was initially identified by enhanced retroviral mutagen (ERM) strategy (53Liu D. Yang X. Yang D. Songyang Z. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5964-5972Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, we constructed enhanced retroviral mutagen (ERM) vectors that contained several engineered sequences (e.g. an ERM tag and a splice donor) controlled by a tetracycline-responsive promoter. The ERM vectors were introduced into the NIH3T3 cells. Endogenous genes can thus be randomly activated and tagged in a conditional system. NIH3T3 cells were used to screen for focus-forming genes using the ERM strategy. Full-length cDNAs encoding human GEFTs were obtained by screening human brain library (Clontech). For mammalian expression, cDNAs encoding GEFT were inserted into the HindIII and SalI sites of pCMV-Tag2B (Stratagene), resulting in the plasmid of pCMV-GEFT. For expression and purification of recombinant GEFT in bacteria, GEFT was subcloned in-frame into pQE-31 (Qiagen), generating His-tagged pQE-GEFT. The wild-type full-lengths of the Rho family GTPases, Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA, were subcloned into theBamHI and SalI sites of pGEX-4T-1, a GST gene fusion vector (Amersham Biosciences), respectively, to produce three GST-fused pGEX vectors. Bacterially expressed His6-tagged GEFT protein and GST fusion GTPases were purified according to the standard procedures of the manufacturers. Escherichia colistrain BL21 was transformed by pQE-GEFT and pGEX vectors, respectively, grown to midlog phase at 37 °C, and then induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3–4 h. For His6-tagged GEFT, the protein was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). For GST fusion GTPases, the proteins were purified by GSH-agarose (Sigma). The GST fusion proteins were in the beads or eluted in the solution containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma). All the proteins used in the assays were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The content of each protein was at least 90% pure. The effects of GEFT on the dissociation of [3H]GDP from the Rho family GTPases were assayed as described previously (37Zhang B. Zhang Y. Wang Z. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25299-25307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 54van Horck F.P. Ahmadian M.R. Haeusler L.C. Moolenaar W.H. Kranenburg O. J. Biol.

Briefly, each 1 μm eluted GTPases was incubated with 1 μm[3H]GDP at 25 °C in the buffer B containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol in the presence or absence of purified 1.5 μm GEFT. To stabilize the [3H]GDP-bound GTPases, the reaction mixtures were supplemented with 20 mmMgCl2. After a binding equilibrium was reached (∼60 min), the GDP/GTP exchange reactions were initiated by the addition of excess free 400 μm GTP (final concentration). At different time points, the reactions were terminated by filtration of 20 μl of the mixtures through nitrocellulose filters. And the filters were washed twice with the ice-cold buffer B. The amount of the radionucleotides remaining bound to the Rho GTPases (RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42) were quantified by scintillation counting, and normalized as the percentage of [3H]GDP bound at time 0. For each time point, the samples were assayed in triplicate. HeLa, COS-7, and NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogene) as previously described according to the manufacturer's instructions (49Xia C. Ma W. Stafford L.J. Marcus S. Xiong W.C. Liu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6174-6179Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cells were then allowed to grow 48 h. For each assay, control vector encoding LacZ was used as a control. For foci formation analyses, infected NIH3T3 cells were maintained in growth medium for 12–14 days and assayed as previously described (56Abe K. Rossman K.L. Liu B. Ritola K.D. Chiang D. Campbell S.L. Burridge K. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10141-10149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Briefly, NIH3T3 cells were infected with GEFT virus or a vector (pMSCV2.1) control virus for 2 days. Cells were then washed with PBS, counted, and plated as shown in 6-well plates coated with 1 μg/ml collagen. 5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum was added and changed every 3 days. Cells were allowed to grow for 14 days in a 37 °C incubator with a 95:5, air/carbon dioxide mixture. At the end of 14 days, cells were washed once with PBS and stained with crystal violet (0.5%), and the number of foci of transformed cells was then quantitated. Total number of foci in each well was counted with a light microscope and foci numbers were averaged for the three wells. COS-7 cells were transfected by using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) as described previously (57Xia C. Bao Z. Yue C. Sanborn B.M. Liu M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19770-19777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Analyses of the cell lysates of the transiently transfected cells were performed using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents from Promegaas described previously (58Xia C. Bao Z. Tabassam F. Ma W. Qiu M. Hua S. Liu M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20942-20948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The reporter constructs for AP1-Luc and c-Jun-Luc were obtained from Stratagene. Reporter constructs for Elk1-luc and SAP1-luc were obtained from Dr. K. L. Guan at the University of Michigan. The data presented are the mean of three individual transfected wells and the experiments were performed at least three times. To study the expression patterns of GEFT in different human tissues, a RNA filter comprising poly(A)-selected RNAs of multiple human tissues (Clontech, Inc.) was hybridized with specific 32P-labeled cDNAs as described previously (49Xia C.

In brief, human GEFT probe were radiolabeled with [α-32P]CTP by nick translation using random primers. Probes (∼4 × 107 cpm/μg) were hybridized with the RNA filter and analyzed according to manufacturers protocol. Immunoprecipitation of individual proteins was carried out as previously described (49Xia C. Ma W. Stafford L.J. Marcus S. Xiong W.C. Liu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6174-6179Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In brief, cell lysates (1 mg of protein) were incubated with antibodies (1–10 μg) at 4 °C for 1 h in a final volume of 1 ml of modified RIPA buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with constant rocking. After the addition of protein A-agarose beads, reactions were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Immune complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting for interacting proteins. For fluorescence labeling of the cellular components and observing cell morphology changes, 48 h after transfection, cells were plated on 10 μg/ml fibronectin-coated glass coverslips. Then, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with monoclonal antibody against FLAG (M2 monoclonal, Sigma). Actin filaments were labeled with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Double-label immunostaining was done with appropriate fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies. Fluorescent images of cells were captured on a CCD camera mounted on an Olympus inverted research microscope using Ultraview imaging software (Olympus, Inc.). To determine GEFT binding affinity to the Rho GTPases, 20 μg of His-tagged protein was incubated at 4 °C overnight with 20 μl of GSH-agarose beads loaded with 20 μg of each GTPase, Cdc42, Rac1, or RhoA in the absence of guanine nucleotides. The beads were washed three times with PBS. The bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and His-tagged GEFT proteins were detected by Western blotting using an anti-His6 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). GTPase activation assays in the cells were performed by GST-p21-binding domain pull-down assays as described previously (59Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A.

Briefly, cells transfected with GEFT or a control plasmid (pCMV-LacZ) were washed and lysed on the dish in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 10 MgCl2, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. GTP-bound Rac1 or Cdc42 was pulled down using the GST-p21-binding domain of PAK1 immobilized on glutathione beads. The amount of active Rac1 and Cdc42 (GTP-bound form) was detected by Western blot using specific antibodies against Rac1 and Cdc42, respectively. Proliferation studies were carried out using the CellTiter96 AQueous One solution cell proliferation assay (Promega). Briefly, cells were transfected with GEFT or a control plasmid. Cells were plated at 500 cells/well and allowed to adhere to the plate. At the indicated time points, the AQueous One solution was added to the samples and measured at 490 nm. Cell migration/motility assays were examined using modified Boyden chambers, as described previously (62Stafford L.J. Xia C. Ma W. Cai Y. Liu M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5399-5404PubMed Google Scholar, 63Banyard J. Anand-Apte B. Symons M. Zetter B.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 580-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Briefly, NIH3T3 cells were stably transfected with GEFT or vector (pCMV-tag2B). The outside of the filters was coated with 1 μg/ml collagen for 1 h and then washed three times with PBS. Filters were then incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with bovine serum albumin for 1 h. Filters were then put into Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal bovine serum and with 0.5 ng of mouse basic fibroblast growth factor. NIH3T3 cells expressing the receptor or vector were seeded at 20,000/well on top of the filter. Plates were incubated for 6 h. Excess cells that did not migrate through the filter were removed from the insides of the filters. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed three times with PBS, and then stained with crystal violet. Stained cells were examined under the microscope. To identify genes responsible to tumorigenesis, an ERM strategy was used to screen for foci-forming genes in NIH3T3 cells (53Liu D. Yang X. Yang D. Songyang Z. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5964-5972Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). One of the novel genes, mutagenized by the ERM, has shown strong oncogenic activity and was identified by reverse transcriptase-PCR and direct sequencing. The gene product shows sequence homology to the Dbl family of GEFs, and was named GEFT. Subsequently, we cloned the human and mouse GEFT full-length open reading frame by reverse transcriptase-PCR and by 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The mouse GEFT (mGEFT) sequence is 90% identical to the human GEFT (hGEFT) (Fig. 1A). In contrast to hGEFT, mGEFT possesses an extra NH2-terminal domain. Like other family members of the Dbl proteins, GEFT has an NH2-terminal Rho exchange factor domain (Dbl homology domain, called DH domain) and is followed by a PH domain (Fig.1B). Sequence alignment of Dbl domains from hGEFT and other Dbl-containing proteins shows significant homology in this region, suggesting that GEFT is a potential exchange factor for the Rho family (RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42) of GTPases (Fig. 1C). A data base search found that GEFT shows 35% sequence identity with human Huntingtin-associated protein-interacting protein (Duo protein) or the spectrin-like Kalirin (64Colomer V. Engelender S.

This ion pair appears biologically significant; it is conserved in almost all vertebrate opsins and may occur in other G-protein-coupled receptors. We report here that the Arg-177/Asp-190 ion pair is critical for the folding and stability of dark state rhodopsin. We find ion pair mutants that regenerate with retinal are functionally and spectrally wild-type-like yet thermally unstable in their dark state because of rapid hydrolysis of the retinal Schiff base linkage. Surprisingly, Arrhenius analysis indicates that the activation energies for the hydrolysis process are similar between the ion pair mutants and wild-type rhodopsin. Furthermore, the ion pair mutants do not show increased reactivity toward hydroxylamine, suggesting that their instability is not caused by an increased exposure to bulk solvent. Our results indicate that the loop E-2 ion pair is important for rhodopsin stability and thus suggest that retinitis pigmentosa observed in patients with Asp-190 mutations may in part be the result of thermally unstable rhodopsin proteins.

Rhodopsin consists of a chain of 348 amino acids, approximately half of which form a cluster of seven membrane-spanning helices located within the membrane (Fig. 1). The rhodopsin chromophore, 11-cis-retinal, resides in the middle of these helices attached to lysine 296 through a protonated Schiff base linkage (9Wald G. Nature. 1968; 219: 800-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 10Hargrave P.A. Hamm H.E. Hofmann K.P. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Interactions of amino acid side chains, as well as water molecules within the chromophore-binding pocket with the retinal, result in the 500 nm absorbance maxima for dark state rhodopsin (11Neitz M.

Dim light vision begins when the 11-cis-retinal chromophore in rhodopsin absorbs a photon and is converted to all-trans-retinal. This change in retinal configuration initiates a series of photo-intermediates and conformational changes in the protein, culminating in a 380 nm absorbing species called metarhodopsin II (MII), the “active conformation” which is able to bind and activate the G-protein transducin (3Meng E.C.

Recently, high resolution crystal structures of rhodopsin have been obtained (2Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E.

These structures confirm some of the previous hypotheses about the rhodopsin structure, such as the general arrangement of the transmembrane helices, the locations of the disulfide bond, and glycosylation sites (16Unger V.M.

One of the most intriguing aspects was the high degree of order in the intradiscal loops (the equivalent to the extracellular loops in other GPCRs and hereby denoted as such). Especially intriguing is loop E-2, which connects helices IV and V (residues 173–198) and forms a twisted औ-hairpin that lies alongside the retinal chromophore, potentially forming a “lid” or “plug” across the retinal-binding pocket (2Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M.

What role does the structure of loop E-2 play in the stability and function of rhodopsin? Does it help provide a place for retinal to bind, or does retinal binding induce structure in loop E-2? If the loop E-2 structure is present in the apoprotein (opsin), how does retinal get into and out of the binding pocket? We have recently begun to address some of these questions, and in the process noticed an ion pair, Arg-177/Asp-190, is present on the ends of loop E-2 (Fig. 1B). This ion pair, Arg-177/Asp-190, is conserved in almost all vertebrate rhodopsins 2Vertebrate rhodopsin alignments were carried out using ExPASy (Expert ProteinAnalysis System) proteomics server of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (us.expasy.org). The sole exception was sheep rhodopsin, which contains a leucine residue at site 190 (Leu-190) and, interestingly, a glutamine residue at site 181 (Gln-181). and may also be present in other GPCRs (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the potentially important functional role of this ion pair is suggested by the fact that mutations at residue Asp-190 in rhodopsin are found in patients with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (ADRP) (22Nathans J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9746-9752Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 23Sung C.H. Schneider B.G. Agarwal N. Papermaster D.S. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this work we report our investigations into the structural and functional role of the Arg-177/Asp-190 ion pair. Our primary finding is that the ion pair helps stabilize the dark state rhodopsin structure. We find that mutations to the ion pair either result in opsin proteins that do not regenerate with 11-cis-retinal or, if they do regenerate, undergo rapid retinal Schiff base hydrolysis in the dark state. Surprisingly, the active MII signaling state and MII decay processes are not affected by mutations at the ion pair. We also find that the ion pair mutations do not increase the susceptibility of Schiff base attack by the bulk solvent (as judged by hydroxylamine reactivity assays) nor affect the activation energy barrier for Schiff base hydrolysis. These results illustrate the importance of loop E-2 in retinal binding, rhodopsin stability, and retinal release processes.

Subsequent to PCR mutagenesis, the PCR fragments were subcloned into the pMT4 vector containing the synthetic gene of rhodopsin usingXhoI and PstI restriction sites, and double mutants were constructed using the BsrI restriction site. Cysteine mutants were subcloned into the pMT4 plasmid theta, a synthetic gene of rhodopsin in which the potentially reactive background cysteine residues 140, 316, 322 and 323 were replaced with serines (31Resek J.F.

The mutant rhodopsin proteins were transiently expressed in COS-1 cells using the DEAE-dextran method, and cells were harvested 56–72 h after transfection as described previously (33Oprian D.D.

Briefly, five 15-cm plates of transfected COS-1 cells were washed twice with 7 ml of cold PBSSC buffer per plate, pelleted, and subsequently resuspended in 10 ml of cold PBSSC (pH 6.5) containing 0.5 mm PMSF. The opsin mutants were then regenerated with 10 ॖm11-cis-retinal at 4 °C for 1 h, and an additional 5 ॖm of 11-cis retinal was then added and regeneration allowed to proceed for an additional 1 h (35Reeves P.J. Hwa J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1927-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The purification of the rhodopsin mutants proceeded essentially as the original procedure (33Oprian D.D. Molday R.S. Kaufman R.J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8874-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), except small polystyrene columns were used for washes and elution (36Dunham T.D. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1683-1690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Cells were solubilized in 5 ml of buffer A containing 0.5 mm PMSF at 4 °C for 1 h and then centrifuged to pellet the unsolubilized fraction. The supernatant was mixed with 200 ॖl of rho1D4 antibody-Sepharose beads (binding capacity ∼1 ॖg of rhodopsin/ॖg of resin) in buffer B containing 0.5 mm PMSF and nutated at 4 °C for 4–5 h. The slurry was subsequently transferred to polystyrene columns and washed once with 50 ml of buffer C followed by a 40-ml wash with buffer D by gravity filtration. Samples were eluted in 350-ॖl fractions of buffer D containing 200 ॖm nonapeptide corresponding to the rho1D4 antibody epitope (the last nine amino acids of the C terminus of rhodopsin). A spectrum of each elution fraction was recorded (described below), and the purified samples were either used immediately or snap-frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. COS cells expressing rhodopsin mutants were pelleted and resuspended in 1 ml/plate of buffer E and homogenized on ice. The homogenates were then centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C, and the pellets were washed with 5 ml of buffer F and subsequently resuspended in buffer F. Protein concentrations of the resuspended membrane pellets were determined by a modified Dc protein Assay from Bio-Rad. The manufacturer's instructions were followed except for the addition 1.457 SDS to each well. Aliquots of the membrane preparation were snap-frozen and stored at −80 °C until use. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar), using a 57 stacking gel and a 107 resolving gel. The protein bands were electrotransferred onto Immobilon-P transfer membranes (Millipore) and detected using the rho1D4 monoclonal antibody as described previously (19Karnik S.S. Sakmar T.P. Chen H.B. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8459-8463Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Protein expression levels were determined using a Bio-Rad PhosphorImager, and pixel densities were determined using a GS-525 molecular imaging system using supplied software. All UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrophotometer at 20 °C using a bandwidth of 2 nm, a response time of 1 s, and a scan speed of 500 nm/min unless otherwise noted. For concentration calculations, a molar extinction coefficient value (ε500) for WT rhodopsin was taken to be 40 600 m−1 cm−1 (38Wald G.B. Brown P.K. J. Gen. Physiol. 1953; 37: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The samples were photobleached in buffer D by illumination for 30 s (at a 6-Hz flash rate) with a Machine Vision Strobe light source (EG & G) equipped with a wavelength >490-nm long-pass filter. This light treatment was found to be adequate for full conversion of all samples. Extinction coefficients were determined for each dark state mutant species as described previously in buffer D at 15 °C (34Janz J.M. Farrens D.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7219-7227Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 39Sakmar T.P. Franke R.R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8309-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). The presence of a protonated Schiff base (PSB) in the MII state for each mutant was verified by adding H2SO4 to a pH of 1.9 immediately after photobleaching and then measuring the absorbance spectrum to assay the presence of a spectral species at 440 nm (which indicates a PSB) (40Sakamoto T. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thermal decay rates were followed by UV-visible spectroscopy in buffer D. Specific temperatures were maintained using water-jacketed cuvette holders connected to a circulating water bath. Temperature was monitored through emersion of a digital thermometer into the sample chamber, with an accuracy of approximately ±0.2 °C. Thermal stability of the mutants was determined by first measuring the samples from 650 to 250 nm at 1-min intervals at a given temperature. Thermal decay rates were then measured by monitoring the decrease of the 500 nm absorbing dark state species from these measurements over time (41Davidson F.F. Loewen P.C. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4029-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 42Andres A. Kosoy A. Garriga P. Manyosa J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5696-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 43Vogel R. Siebert F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3529-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Base-line drift was corrected for by normalizing all spectra to an absorbance of 0 at 650 nm. Thermal decay rates were also measured by monitoring the increase in tryptophan fluorescence at 330 nm, caused by the release of retinal from the chromophore-binding pocket (44Farrens D.L. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5073-5076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The experimental set up was similar to that of the retinal release assay (described below) except that the samples were not photobleached. All thermal decay data was analyzed using mono-exponential decay (absorbance experiments) or mono-exponential rise to maxima (fluorescence experiments) fitting algorithms in Sigma Plot (Jandel Scientific software). Activation energies (Ea) were determined by applying rate data to the Arrhenius equation: k =Ae−Ea/(RT). Thermodynamic parameters ΔH‡, ΔG‡, and ΔΔG‡were calculated from the rate data as described previously (41Davidson F.F. Loewen P.C. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4029-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 45Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. Wiley Interscience, New York1975: 931-941Google Scholar). Briefly, the following thermodynamic Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3 were used,ΔG‡=−(2.3)RT log(klh/kBT)Equation 1 Ea=ΔH‡−TΔS‡Equation 2 ΔG‡=ΔH‡−TΔS‡Equation 3 where R is the universal gas constant; Tis the temperature; k1 is the thermal decay rate, h is Planck's constant, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. The MII stability was assessed by measuring the time course of retinal release occurring after MII formation using a Photon Technologies QM-1 steady state fluorescence spectrophotometer (44Farrens D.L. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5073-5076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Each measurement was carried out using 100 ॖl of a 0.25 ॖm mutant sample in buffer D, and sample temperature was maintained as described above. After the samples were photobleached to the MII state (see above), the retinal release measurements were carried out at the appropriate temperature by exciting the sample for 3 s (excitation wavelength = 295 nm, ¼-nm bandwidth slit setting) and then blocking the excitation beam for 42 s to avoid further photobleaching the samples. Tryptophan fluorescence emission was monitored at 330 nm (12-nm bandwidth slit setting), and this cycle was repeated for up to 100 min during each measurement. To determine the t12 values for retinal release, experimental data were analyzed using a mono-exponential rise to maxima fit in Sigma Plot (Jandel Scientific software). In this manner a series of MII decay rates was obtained at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 °C, and their rates were applied to the Arrhenius equation,k =Ae−Ea/(RT), to determine the activation energy (Ea) of the retinal release process for each mutant rhodopsin. Activation of GT by rhodopsin was monitored using fluorescence spectroscopy at 10 °C as described previously (34Janz J.M. Farrens D.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7219-7227Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar,46Phillips W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15498-15505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Fahmy K.

Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). The excitation wavelength was 295 nm (2-nm bandwidth), and fluorescence emission was monitored at 340 nm (12-nm bandwidth). Photobleached mutant rhodopsin (see above) was added to a concentration of 5 nm to the reaction mixture consisting of 250 nm GT in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.017 DM, and the mixture allowed to stir for 300 s. The reaction was then initiated with the addition of GTPγS to a final concentration of 5 ॖm, and the increase in fluorescence was followed for an additional 2000 s. To calculate the initial activation rates, the slopes of the initial fluorescence increase following GTPγS addition were determined through the data points covering the first 60 s. Activation of GT by rhodopsin was monitored as described above. Activation assays were first performed on freshly thawed WT and R177Q stocks. The stocks were next incubated in the dark at 37 °C to facilitate thermal decay of the 500 nm absorbing species, and aliquots were withdrawn at the indicated time points and assayed for GT activation. Hydroxylamine reactivity of the dark state was determined for purified rhodopsins by monitoring the rate of 500 nm absorbance decrease after the addition of hydroxylamine (pH 6.0) to the samples in buffer D to a final concentration of 50 mm at the indicated temperatures (49Sakmar T.P. Franke R.R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3079-3083Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Base-line drift was corrected as described above (see “Thermal Bleaching of Rhodopsin Samples”). Amino acid mutations were constructed based on their ability to disrupt or potentially restore the ion pair charge interaction, while introducing minimal steric perturbation. Thus, residue Arg-177 was mutated to R177K (conserved charge) and R177Q (neutral substitution). Residue Asp-190 was mutated to D190E (conserved charge) and D190N (ADRP mutation, neutral charge). Mutants R177C and D190C were constructed to enable chemical modification of the single cysteine residues. We did not analyze other ADRP-associated point mutations at site Asp-190 (D190A, D190G, and D190Y), because previous reports suggest these mutations are defective in folding, trafficking, and/or chromophore binding (23Sung C.H.

Expressed ion pair mutant rhodopsins were analyzed for expression levels, proper post-translational modifications, ability to bind 11-cis-retinal, and photobleaching properties. Immunoblot analysis of mutants expressed from transfected COS cells indicates all mutants expressed to similar levels comparable with that of wild-type rhodopsin (Fig. 3A). Mutants R177C, D190C, and D190E did not regenerate in our hands and were therefore not further characterized. These mutants also had abnormal glycosylation patterns in comparison to WT rhodopsin in that they did not exhibit the characteristic glycosylation smear pattern when expressed in COS cells (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, mutants defective in chromophore binding tended to form large molecular weight aggregates relative to both WT and other mutants (Fig.3A). Immunoblot analysis of recombinant rhodopsins purified using the rho1D4 monoclonal antibody reveal a band pattern similar to that of wild-type rhodopsin, with an apparent molecular mass of ∼40 kDa and the characteristic heterogeneous glycosylation smear due to overexpression in a COS cell system (Fig. 3B), (50Kaushal S. Ridge K.D. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4024-4028Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Mutants capable of regenerating with 11-cis-retinal formed characteristic rhodopsin-like pigments and could be purified to obtain spectral ratios (A280/A500) between 1.6 and 1.8. The Arg-177 and Asp-190 single point mutants exhibited normal photobleaching behavior with respect to formation of a blue-shifted λmax ≈380 nm species (characteristic of the MII intermediate) (9Wald G. Nature. 1968; 219: 800-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Acidification of these photobleached samples generated a λmax = 440 nm species, indicating the presence of a protonated retinal Schiff base (PSB) (40Sakamoto T. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These results are compiled in Table I, and a representative example of the photobleaching behavior is shown for mutants R177Q and D190N (Fig.4A). Similar to the single mutants R177Q and D190N, the R177Q/D190N double mutant shows wild-type behavior in terms of expression levels, post-transla"
https://openalex.org/W2073480952,"A novel conotoxin, κ-conotoxin (κ-BtX), has been purified and characterized from the venom of a worm-hunting cone snail, Conus betulinus. The toxin, with four disulfide bonds, shares no sequence homology with any other conotoxins. Based on a partial amino acid sequence, its cDNA was cloned and sequenced. The deduced sequence consists of a 26-residue putative signal peptide, a 31-residue mature toxin, and a 13-residue extra peptide at the C terminus. The extra peptide is cleaved off by proteinase post-processing. All three Glu residues are γ-carboxylated, one of the two Pro residues is hydroxylated at position 27, and its C-terminal residue is Pro-amidated. The monoisotopic mass of the toxin is 3569.0 Da. Electrophysiological experiments show that: 1) among voltage-gated channels, κ-BtX is a specific modulator of K+ channels; 2) among the K channels, κ-BtX specifically up-modulates the Ca2+- and voltage-sensitive BK channels (252 ± 47%); 3) its EC50 is 0.7 nm with a single binding site (Hill = 0.88); 4) the time constant of wash-out is 8.3 s; and 5) κ-BtX has no effect on single channel conductance, but increases the open probability of BK channels.

In many cases, determination of a new subtype of ion channel has depended on finding a specific biotoxin (1Hille B. Ionic Channels in Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar, 2Miller C. Neuron. 1995; 15: 5-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). In particular, K+ channels are much more diverse than Na+ and Ca2+ channels. Therefore, new, subtype-specific biotoxins provide valuable tools to identify distinct subtypes of K+ channels and to study their functions in native systems (3Zhou Z. Neher E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 469: 245-273Crossref Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 4Horn R. Marty A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 145-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar, 5Garcia M.L. Knaus H.G. Munujos P.

Cone snails are predatory, venomous mollusks that use a common general strategy to capture their prey. As a genus, cones use a rather diverse spectrum of prey, including at least three different types: fishes, other mollusks, and marine worms. Their venoms contain a large number of small, conformationally constrained peptides that display highly potent and specific biological activity. For example, α-conotoxins are competitive antagonists of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; δ- and μ-conotoxins act at sites VI and I of voltage-sensitive sodium channels, respectively; ω-conotoxins selectively inhibit presynaptic calcium channels at neuromuscular junctions; and κ-conotoxin PVIIA inhibits Shaker-type potassium channels (7Myers R.A.

Toxicon. 2001; 39: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The conotoxins are much smaller than other peptide toxins, with only 10–30 amino acids. The pattern of disulfide bridges of each conotoxin family is relatively conserved (14Olivera B.M. Rivier J. Clark C. Remilo C.A. Corpuz G.P. Abogadie F.C. Mena E.E. Woodward S.R. Hillyard D.R. Cruz L.J. Science. 1990; 249: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). A large number of conotoxins have been characterized, most of them from piscivorous (fish-hunting) and molluscivorous (mollusk-hunting) snails, since they have relatively high toxicity to vertebrates. In contrast, the venom of vermivorous (worm-hunting) snails has been seldom studied. A number of conotoxins were characterized in a recently published work (15Chen J.S. Fan C.X. Hu K.P. Wei K.H. Zhong M.N. J. Nat. Toxins. 1999; 8: 341-347PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the venom of a vermivorous species, Conus betulinus, which is found in the South China Sea. Although not highly toxic to vertebrates, the venom of C. betulinus causes obvious symptoms such as aggressiveness, stiff tail, paralysis, convulsions, and even death when injected intraventricularly into mice. In the first part of this report, we describe the purification and characterization of a new family of conotoxins, κ-conotoxin BtX (κ-BtX),1 by using protein sequence determination, gene cloning, and functional assays. This toxin is characterized by the presence of four instead of two or three disulfide bonds, as usually found in other conotoxins, and shares no sequence homology with any others. In the second part of this report, we describe the electrophysiological findings from whole cell patch clamp recording that κ-BtX is a K+ channel up-modulator, not a blocker, targeting the Ca2+ and voltage dependent K+ channel in rat adrenal chromaffin cells (RACCs). κ-BTX is therefore a novel and unique pharmacological tool to dissect out the functional properties of the different subtypes of K+ channels. Sephadex G-25 was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile for HPLC were from Merck. The 3′-RACE and 5′-RACE kits, TRIzol reagent, and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Invitrogen. Restriction endonucleases and TaqDNA polymerase were from MBI Company and Sangon Company, respectively. The DNA sequencing kit was purchased from Promega, and [α-32P]dATP was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Acrylamide, bisacrylamide, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside (X-gal), isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactoside, and all other reagents were of analytical grade. All chemicals used in the electrophysiological experiments were from Sigma. Specimens of C. betulinuswere collected from Sanya, Hainan Province in the South China Sea. The venom apparatus was dissected out, and the venom duct was cut in sections and homogenized. The venom was then extracted with 1.1% (v/v) acetic acid containing the protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The sample was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min. The residue was resuspended and soaked in the same buffer for 10 min, and then centrifuged again. Finally, the supernatants were combined, lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C. Lyophilized samples were reextracted with 1.1% acetic acid. After centrifugation, the supernatant was placed on a pre-equilibrated Sephadex G-25SF column (100 × 2.6 cm) and eluted with 1.1% acidic acid at 4 °C. The fractions were collected at flow rate of 0.35 ml/min (Fig.1A). The fractions from each peak were pooled and lyophilized. The freeze-dried fractions IV from gel filtration were dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and applied to HPLC with a Phenomenex C18 semipreparative column (25 × 1 cm, micron). The peptides were eluted with a gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. The κ-BtX fraction was located in peak 5 (Fig. 1B), which was repurified under the same conditions. About 200 μg of the purified peptide was dissolved in 1 m Tris-HCl, 6m guanidine hydrochloride, and 1 mm EDTA at pH 8.5 and reduced with 2 mg of dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 5 h. Then it was alkylated with 5 mg of idoacetic acid and kept in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. The modified peptide was purified by HPLC. This carboxymethylated peptide (Rcm-κ-BtX) was directly used for automatic sequencing on a PE ABI model 491 peptide/protein sequencer and PTH analyzer using the program provided by the manufacturer. Rcm-κ-BtX- and TPCK-treated trypsin were mixed at a ratio of 50:1 and incubated in 0.5 ml of buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm calcium chloride, pH 7.8) at 37 °C for 10 h. The cleaved fragments were separated and purified on a C-18 reverse-phase HPLC. Mass spectral analyses of the native toxin, its modified form Rcm-κ-BtX, and degraded fragments were performed on a Finnigan LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoQuest, San Jose, CA). The apparatus was equipped with an electrospray ionization source with a spray voltage of 4.5 kV. Mass spectra of the native toxin were also obtained using a Q-TOF mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) equipped with an electrospray ionization source and a matrix assistant laser desorption ionization (MALDI) TOF mass spectrometer (Brucker Biflex III). 3′- and 5′-RACE were used to clone the cDNA of κ-BtX from the fresh venom ducts of C. betulinus by using the TRIzol reagent kit. Five μg of total RNA was converted into cDNA using superscript II reverse transcriptase and a universal oligo(dT)-containing adapter primer (5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTAC(dT)17-3′). Using the degenerate codons, a gene-specific primer 1 with a BamHI restriction site (as underlined in 5′-CGGGATCC GCC AAC GGT AC(G/A/T/C) TA(T/C) TG-3′) encoding residues 3–8 of κ-BtX was designed and synthesized. Primer 1 was paired with an abridged universal primer with a HindIII restriction site (as underlined in 5′-GCAAGCTTACGCGTCGACTAGTAC-3′) similar to the adapter primer but devoid of the polyT for 3′RACE amplification. The amplification products with a size of about 300 bp were purified, cloned into the T-vector, and transformed into DH5α, and the positive clones were sequenced. 5′-RACE is based on the partial cDNA sequence determined by 3′-RACE. A gene-specific primer 2 with a BamHI restriction site (as underlined in 5′-CGGGATCCTACGACGAGAAGCA-3′) corresponding to the cDNA sequence downstream of the stop codon at bp 21–34 was designed and synthesized. The first strand cDNA was transcripted with primer 2 using 1 μg of total RNA as template. After the cDNA was purified on a Glassmax column, the homopolymeric dC was then tailed to its 3′-end. The dC-tailed cDNA was further amplified using a nested primer 3 with an XbaI restriction site 3 bp downstream from the stop codon (as underlined in 5′-CGTCTAGACAGACCTCTGAGCAAC-3′) and an abridged anchor primer (5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACGGGIIGGGIIG-3′) complementary to the dC tail. To obtain a high yield of toxin-specific cDNA, a second PCR was performed using primer 3 and another anchor primer devoid of dG with a HindIII restriction site (as underlined in 5′-GCAAGCTTACGCGTCGACTAGTAC-3′). The final PCR products were sequenced as described above. The whole cDNA sequence of κ-BtX was generated by combining the two fragments amplified by 3′- and 5′-RACE. The total genomic DNA was isolated from cone venom glands using a NaClO4 extraction procedure followed by RNase treatment (16Johns Jr., M.B. Paulus-Thomas J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 276-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Primer 4 with anXbaI restriction site (as underlined in 5′-CGTCTAGA TGC CGC GCT GAA GGA-3′), corresponding to amino acid residues 1–5 (Cys-Arg-Ala-Glu-Gly), and primer 2 were used as a pair to amplify the genomic DNA of κ-BtX. The amplified product with a size of around 200 bp was purified and cloned into the T-vector for sequencing. RACCs were prepared from adult Wistar rats (250–300 g) as described previously (17Zhou Z. Misler S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3498-3505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 18Wu J.J. He L.L. Zhou Z. Chi Z.W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2844-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Single cells were obtained after a 40-min digestion in enzyme solution. The cells were cultured with Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium in a CO2 incubator. Cells were used in experiments after 1–6 days in culture. The standard external solution (bath solution) contained 140 mm NaCl, 2.8 mmKCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, at pH 7.4. The “high TEA (tetraethylammonium chloride)” solution was the same as the standard solution, except that the 20 mm NaCl was replaced by 20 mm TEA. The “high Cs+” solution was the same as the standard, but KCl was replaced by CsCl. The standard internal solution in the patch pipette contained 145 mmKCl, 8 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 250 μg/ml nystatin, pH 7.2. Samples of κ-BtX were dissolved in the bath solution at the final concentration needed. The voltage-gated membrane currents were recorded under whole cell voltage clamp using the nystatin perforated patch clamp technique (3Zhou Z. Neher E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 469: 245-273Crossref Scopus (356) Google Scholar,4Horn R. Marty A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 145-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). The series resistance (Rs) was typically 10–20 megaohms before Rs compensation. Before cell recording, 75–90% Rs compensation was applied to allow fast voltage clamp of the voltage-dependent big conductance K(Ca2+) channel (BK) currents. An outside-out patch was obtained by excising the patch from a cell in the whole cell configuration. Experiments were done using patch clamp amplifiers Axon 200B (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and PC-2B (INBIO Inc., Wuhan, China). Data were analyzed with Igor software (AveMatrix, Lack Oswego, OR). The κ-BtX was applied to the cell under investigation through a glass micropipette by applying slight positive pressure (3Zhou Z. Neher E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 469: 245-273Crossref Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Control/wash-out solutions and toxins other than κ-BtX were puffed locally onto the cell via an RCP-2B multichannel microperfusion system (INBIO Inc., Wuhan, China), which allowed fast change of solutions by electronic switching between seven solution channels (18Wu J.J. He L.L. Zhou Z. Chi Z.W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2844-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The puffer pipette (100-μm tip diameter) was located about 120 μm from the cell. We determined, by a conductance test using pure water as perfusion solution, that the recorded cell would only be contacted by puffer solution if the application speed was 100 μl/min or faster. All of the pharmacological experiments in this study met this requirement. All these experiments were done at room temperature (22–25 °C). Each data point of a dose-response curve represents the mean ± S.D. of at least five cells. Dose-response curves were fit to Equation 1 γ=100/{1+([toxin]/EC50)n}Equation 1 where γ is the relative response (%); n is the Hill coefficient; [toxin] is the drug concentration; and EC50 is the dissociation constant. To define the average open probability (Po) of single channels in a patch containing more than one BK channel, we determined the probability thatr channels were open simultaneously (19Colquhoun D. Hawkes A.G. Sakmann B. Neher E. Second Ed. Single Channel Recording. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 397-482Google Scholar). The parameterr follows a binomial distribution, as shown in Equation2P(r)=∑r=0nCnrP0r(1−P0)n−r=n!r!(n−r)!P0r(1−P0)n−r(r=0,1,····n)Equation 2 where n is the total number of channels in the patch and Po is the open probability. Equation (2Miller C. Neuron. 1995; 15: 5-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) was used to fit the mean open time distribution and determinePo. This formula is ideal for non-inactivating channels. However, since the inactivation rate of BK channels was not altered by κ-BtX (see Figs. 4 and 7), we could still use this formula to calculate relative changes of Powith and without κ-BtX. Total open time of the single channels was defined as the sum of open times from all single channels during a given pulse. If two channels opened simultaneously, the total open time was the sum of the open times of both channels.Figure 7ChTX blocks κ-BtX induced BK up-modulation. As shown in A, ChTX (100 nm) blocked the κ-BtX (10 nm)-induced BK up-modulation. BK currents induced by the double-pulse protocol shown in Fig. 1 were superimposed according to stimulus time. All traces were from the same whole cell patch (n = 7). As shown inB, data were measured using the protocol shown inpanel A. The up-modulation was normalized to BK current under control conditions. κ-BtX increased BK current to 168 ± 11% of control level. ChTX reduced the total K+ current to 30 ± 6% (without κ-BtX, n = 6) and 71 ± 4% (with κ-BtX, n = 7) of its control level (p < 0.01). TEA (1 mm) reduced the total K+ current to 15 ± 2% (without κ-BtX,n = 8) and 17 ± 3% (with κ-BtX,n = 3) of its control level.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The κ-BtX purified from C. betulinus venom was subjected to automatic sequencing directly after reduction and carboxymethylation. The partial N-terminal sequence was determined as follows: CRANGTYCNNDSQCCLN. Since the retention times of PTH-Gla and PTH-Asn were very close, Gla residues 4 and 9 were at first misinterpreted as Asn (underlined). According to the N-terminal partial sequence of the toxin, the gene-specific primer 1 was designed and synthesized for 3′-RACE. Despite the mismatch in the synthesized oligonucleotide resulting from the misinterpreted amino acid in position 4 (corresponding to codon AAC instead of GAA in the primer), the 3′-RACE could still be performed successfully. Based on the partial 3′-cDNA sequence, primer 2 was used for the 5′-RACE. The whole cDNA sequence of the conotoxin κ-BtX was subsequently obtained by combining the two amplified fragments (Fig.2). The deduced amino acid sequence consisted of a putative signal peptide of 26 residues and a protoxin of 44 residues. According to the amino acid analysis (data not shown) and the partial N-terminal sequence, the sequence of the mature toxin devoid of an extra C-terminal was as follows: CRAEGTYCENDSQCCLNECCWGGCGHPCRHP* (the asterisk indicates C-terminal amidation). The C terminus of the mature toxin was followed by an extra 13-residue peptide, as a propeptide, which was removed during post-translational processing. The calculated molecular mass of this mature toxin was 148 Da less than that measured. Furthermore, there was a 132 Da difference between the LCQ-MS and the MALDI-TOF-MS analyses (Table I). These differences suggested that the toxin might be post-translationally modified, for example by carboxylation of glutamate, hydroxylation of proline, and amidation of the C terminus, as is often the case for conotoxins. If all three Glu residues at positions 4, 9, and 18 were carboxylated (Gla), one of the two Pro residues at position 27 or at 31 hydroxylated, and the C terminus amidated, then the calculated molecular weight (3569.2) would be quite consistent with the measured value (3569.0). Furthermore, the presence of Gla residues was verified by the mass spectrometric analysis. When the MALDI source was used instead of the electrospray ionization source, the decarboxylation of the peptide resulted in a total loss of 132 Da, corresponding to three decarboxylated groups of Gla residues.Table IMeasured and calculated molecular masses for κ-BtXSpeciesLCQ-MS(ESI)MALDI-TOF-MSQ-TOF-MS(ESI)Average massAverage massMonoisotopic massNatural κ-BtX357234403569.0(Calculated)(3572)(3572)(3569.2)Rcm-κ-BtX40443912(Calculated)(4044)(4044) Open table in a new tab To determine in which position the hydroxyproline was located, the reduced and carboxymethylated conotoxin was further digested with TPCK-trypsin. As there are only two cleavage sites for TPCK-trypsin in the toxin (Arg at positions 2 and 29), the enzymatic cleavage removed two peptides, both with two residues, from the N and C termini. The remaining fragment (from residues 3 to 29) was then purified on HPLC and subjected to mass spectrometric analysis. A mass of 3492 Da was measured, matching quite well with the calculated value (3492.5 Da). Thus, the hydroxyproline was located at position 27, and the full sequence of κ-BtX is as follows: CRAγ GTYCγNDSQCCLNγCCWGGCGHOCRHP* (γ is γ-carboxyglutamate; O is hydroxyproline; the asterisk indicates C-terminal amidation). Based on the elucidated cDNA sequence of κ-BtX, primers 2 and 4 were used to amplify the genomic DNA corresponding to the κ-BtX gene. The analysis showed that the genomic sequence is identical to the cDNA sequence. This finding implies that there is no intron in the genomic DNA structure of κ-BtX. Chromaffin cells are endocrine cells that differentiate from the neural crest during embryonic development. They are excitable cells with typical neuronal voltage-gated Na+, K+, and Ca2+ channels and are widely used as a neuronal model (3Zhou Z. Neher E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 469: 245-273Crossref Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 17Zhou Z. Misler S. J. Biol.

Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 453: 97-131Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To investigate whether κ-BtX affects voltage-gated ion channels, we studied the effect of κ-BtX on these channels in RACCs (Fig. 3). In Fig.3A, the top panel shows current traces induced by a voltage ramp (bottom panel). Three ramp-induced currents were superimposed. The cell was stimulated by the first ramp in the absence of toxin (Control). The inward transient current was activated at about −30 mV and corresponded to a typical, voltage-gated Na+ current. The outward current (positive current component) was activated from −30 mV and increased in amplitude toward positive voltages, as expected for a typical, voltage-gated outward K+ current (17Zhou Z. Misler S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3498-3505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 24Neely A. Lingle C.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 453: 97-131Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The cell was subsequently stimulated by a second ramp in the presence of 1 μm of κ-BtX, which resulted in a 2-fold increase of the peak outward current. The up-modulating effect on the outward current was statistically significant. The K+ current in response to the third ramp, after removal of κ-BtX, recovered to the control level. Along with Na+ and K+ currents, RACCs have voltage-gated Ca2+ channels of the L-, N-, P/Q-, and R-types (23Elhamdani A. Zhou Z. Artalejo C.R. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6230-6240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3B shows the effect of κ-BtX on Ca2+ currents, which were sensitive to 200 μmCd2+ (data not shown). To isolate the Ca2+currents, the Na+ current was blocked by removing Na+ from the external solution. All voltage-gated K+ currents were blocked by high extracellular TEA and high internal Cs+. The three Ca2+ current traces were recorded as control, test (1 μm κ-BtX), and recovery, sequentially at 120-s intervals. All three Ca2+currents were nearly identical, indicating that κ-BtX had little or no effect on the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (n = 7). The target of κ-BtX was found to be the BK channel (Fig.4). In a standard double-pulse protocol to test the BK current (25Solaro C.R. Prakriya M. Ding J.P. Lingle C.J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6110-6123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the first step of the double pulse (from −70 to 0 mV for 100 ms) induced Ca2+ influx through the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, which activated the typical large and fast-inactivating BK currents during the strong depolarization of the second step (from 0 to 80 mV for 500ms, Fig.4A, trace 1). Most BK currents were absent when the prepulse for loading Ca2+ was omitted (Fig.4A, trace 2). The difference between traces 1 and 2 yielded the pure BK currents, and this difference was used to determine the effects of κ-BtX (Fig.4B). During application of 10 nm κ-BtX, the BK currents induced by the double-pulse protocol were 2.3 times greater than the control (or the current after wash-out). On average, κ-BtX (10 nm) increased (or up-modulated) BK currents by 2.51 ± 0.47 times control (n = 65, Fig.4C). Since BK current was the dominant component in the double-pulse protocol, the “pure BK currents” in Fig. 4Bwere very similar to trace 1 in panel A. The dose-response curve of the up-modulation effect is illustrated in Fig.4D. κ-BtX had an EC50 of 0.7 nmfor BK channels. The Hill coefficient was 0.88, indicating that there was a single binding site between κ-BtX and the BK channel. We found that the BK current was the exclusive subtype of voltage-gated K+ channel sensitive to κ-BtX in RACCs (Fig.5). Pure Ca2+-independent but voltage-dependent K+ current, or Kzcurrent, can be recorded in Ca2+-free bathing solution. The “Kz channel” is a delayed rectifier channel with fast activation and slow inactivation kinetics (6Hoshi T. Aldrich R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 91: 73-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 24Neely A. Lingle C.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 453: 97-131Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the presence of 2 mm Ca2+, application of 10 nmκ-BtX increased K+ currents induced by the step depolarization pulses 2-fold, having evoked both Ca2+influx and BK currents. When the bath was changed to a Ca2+-free solution, κ-BtX failed to increase the depolarization-induced K+ current. Statistically, κ-BtX increased total depolarization (single pulse)-induced currents by 67 ± 7% with 2 mm Ca2+ and −2 ± 5% in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 5B,n = 5). There is controversy in the literature concerning the effects of charybdotoxin (ChTX) on SK channel, which is another type of Ca2+ dependent K channel in RACCs (5Garcia M.L. Knaus H.G. Munujos P. Slaughter R.S. Kaczorowski G.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1-C10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To compare the effects of κ-BtX and ChTX, we reexamined the effect of ChTX on SK channels. Pure SK currents were examined by another type of double-pulse protocol (Fig.6A) (17Zhou Z. Misler S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3498-3505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 26Neely A. Lingle C.J. J Physiol (Lond.). 1992; 453: 133-166Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 27Park Y.B. J Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 481: 555-570Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Again the prepulse (from −70 mV to 0 mV for 1 s) induced Ca2+influx, which activated a Ca2+-dependent and voltage-independent inward current (thick trace) during the hyperpolarization of the second pulse (from 0 mV to −100 mV). The hyperpolarization deactivated all voltage-dependent currents, including the BK current. Most of the inward current at −100 mV was absent when the Ca2+-loading prepulse was omitted (Fig. 6A, thin trace). This Ca2+-sensitive inward current at −100 mV was assumed to be an SK current because the specific SK antagonist apamin (100 nm) blocked it by 50% (Fig. 6B). In contrast to the BK current, the extracellular application of a very high concentration of κ-BtX (1000 nm) induced only a minor increase (∼10%) in the SK current (Fig. 6B). In contrast, the BK channel antagonist ChTX (200 nm) blocked 53 ± 3% of SK currents, so it is as potent as the specific SK blocker apamin (Fig. 6, C and D). That the BK channels were the targets of κ-BtX was further supported by experiments using the BK blocker ChTX. As shown in Fig.7A, up-modulation of the BK current by 10 nm κ-BtX was largely removed by 100 nm ChTX. The κ-BtX induced up-modulation was readily reversible; after a 5-min wash-out, the up-modulation recovered by 90% (Fig. 7A). Since the Kd of κ-BtX was 0.7 nm (Fig. 4C), 10 nm was a saturating concentration and produced the maximum effect. Note that the peak K+ current in the presence of ChTX + κ-BtX was even smaller than that without them. This was probably"

Ectoenzymes detected on these cells were recently shown to terminate ATP-mediated responses by sequential dephosphorylation of extracellular ATP into ADP, AMP, and adenosine. We now demonstrate that an ecto-adenylate kinase (ecto-AK) contributes to the metabolism of adenine nucleotides on human airway epithelial surfaces by the reversible reaction: ATP + AMP ⇆ 2ADP. This phosphotransferase exhibited a bilateral distribution on polarized primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells with a 4-fold higher activity on the mucosal surface. Ecto-AK presented an absolute requirement for magnesium and adenine-based nucleotides. UMP, GMP, and CMP could not substitute for AMP as γ-phosphate acceptor, and UDP could not replace ADP. Apparent K m andV max values were 23 ± 5 μmand 1.1 ± 0.1 nmol·min−1·cm−2 for ATP and 43 ± 6 μm and 0.5 ± 0.1 nmol·min−1·cm−2 for ADP. Ecto-AK accounted for 20% of [γ-32P]ATP dephosphorylation, and the impermeant AK inhibitor, diadenosine pentaphosphate, reduced ADPase activity by more than 70% on both epithelial surfaces. Time course experiments on ATP metabolism demonstrated that ecto-AK significantly prolongs effective ATP and ADP concentrations on airway epithelial surfaces for P2 receptor signaling and reduces by 6-fold adenosine production.

On the mucosal surface, they interact with two members of the G-protein-coupled P2Y receptor (P2YR) family: P2Y2 (13Mason S.J. Paradiso A.M. Boucher R.C. Br. J.

P2Y2 receptors are equally activated by ATP and UTP, but not by ADP or UDP, whereas P2Y6 receptors are potently activated by UDP and weakly activated by ADP.

Patch clamp and Ussing chamber experiments indicated that ATP-induced Ca2+ entry through these channels stimulates luminal Cl− secretion.

Over the last decade, several studies have demonstrated the role of cell surface nucleotide metabolism in the regulation of MCC-related epithelial functions (9Wang Y. Roman R. Lidofsky S.D. Fitz G.

Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1485-C1497Google Scholar). However, ATP also produced a post-peak sustained increase in CBF that was prevented by the nonspecific adenosine receptor antagonist, 8-p-sulfophenyltheophylline. Hypotonicity-induced cell swelling triggered ATP release and activation of volume-sensitive Cl− channels by a mechanism that required cell surface conversion of ATP into adenosine (10Musante L.

We reported that human nasal and bronchial epithelial surfaces express metabolic enzymes that sequentially dephosphorylate ATP into ADP, AMP, and adenosine and UTP into UDP, UMP, and uridine (29Picher M. Boucher R.C. Pediatr. Pulmonology Suppl. 1999; 19 (abstr.): 311Google Scholar, 30Picher M. Burch L.H. Hirsh A.J. Spychala J. Boucher R.C. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31061-31068Google Scholar) proposed that extracellular nucleotide metabolism in human airways also involves transphosphorylating enzymes. They identified a nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) activity on the mucosal surface of human nasal epithelial cells. Classically described as ubiquitous intracellular enzymes, NDPKs catalyze the transfer of γ-phosphate groups between nucleoside di- and triphosphates by the reversible reaction: NTP + NDP ⇆ NDP + NTP (for a review, see Ref.33Lacombe M.-L. Milon L. Munier A. Mehus J.G. Lambeth D.O. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 247-258Google Scholar). Transphosphorylation events taking place in most intracellular compartments combine the activities of NDPKs and adenylate kinases (AKs; ATP:AMP-phosphotransferases). In contrast to the broad substrate specificity of NDPKs, AKs transfer phosphate groups between adenine-based nucleotides by the reaction: MgATP + AMP ⇆ MgADP + ADP (for a review, see Ref. 34Van Rompay A.R.

Biol. 2001; 26: 209-215Google Scholar). However, the physiological role of cell surface adenine nucleotide transphosphorylation has not been explored. In the present study, we describe the biochemical and kinetic properties, as well as the polarity, of ecto-AK expressed at the surface of human bronchial epithelia. We measured the impact of ecto-AK on the availability of adenine nucleotides for P2 (ATP and ADP) and P1 (adenosine) receptors regulating MCC. We tested the hypothesis that ecto-AK could extend the duration of locally released ATP to promote airway clearance of noxious agents. Biochemical assays were performed on polarized primary cultures of bronchial epithelial cells from normal donors and patients diagnosed with cystic fibrosis (CF), an inherited obstructive lung disease characterized by impaired MCC, chronic infection, and inflammation (for a review, see Ref. 41Wine J.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 309-312Google Scholar). This study provides evidence that ecto-AK plays a major role in the prolongation of P1 and P2 receptor-mediated MCC functions on human airway epithelial surfaces. Well differentiated primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells were grown as described previously (42Gray T.E. Guzman K. Davis C.W. Abdullah L.H. Nettesheim P. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 104-112Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were isolated from freshly excised main stem bronchi by protein digestion (43Wu R. Yankaskas J. Cheng E. Knowles M.R. Boucher R.C. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1985; 132: 311-320Google Scholar) and plated on porous Transwell Col filters (well diameter, 12 mm; pore size, 0.45 μm) in air-liquid interface medium (50:50 mixture of LHC basal and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-high glucose, 0.5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 50 nm retinoic acid, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.8% bovine pituitary extract, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/μl streptomycin) (44Lechner J.F.

Once they reached confluence, the cultures were maintained in air-liquid interface with medium added only to the serosal compartment. After 4 weeks, the cultures were composed of columnar ciliated cells (>90%) and secretory cells covering a layer of basal-like cells (45Matsui H. Davis C.W. Tarran R. Boucher R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1419-1427Google Scholar). Enzyme assays were conducted on cultures with transepithelial electrical resistance ≥ 300 ohms·cm−2. Lactate dehydrogenase activity was employed as a test of cellular integrity. Primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells were rinsed three times with Krebs-Ringer buffer (KRB): 140 mm Na+, 120 mmCl−, 5.2 mm K+, 25 mmHCO3−, 2.4 mm HPO4−, 1.6 mm Ca2+, 1.6 mm Mg2+, 5.2 mm glucose, and 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and preincubated in KRB (350 μl mucosal/serosal) for 30 min at 37 °C (5% CO2/95% O2). All reactions were initiated by the addition of the substrate(s), dissolved in 35 μl of KRB, to the mucosal or serosal bath, and stopped by transferring 10-μl aliquots to tubes containing 300 μl of ice-cold water. The samples were boiled for 5 min, filtered, and analyzed by reversed-phase paired-ion HPLC. ATPase activity was measured with [3H]ATP (0.5 μCi) or [γ-32P]ATP (0.1 μCi) as substrates. ADPase and UDPase activities were assayed with [3H]ADP (0.5 μCi) and [3H]UDP (0.5 μCi), respectively. The forward ecto-AK reaction (ATP + AMP → 2ADP) was initiated with equal concentrations of [γ-32P]ATP (0.1 μCi) and AMP mixed previously and then quantified by the rate of [β-32P]ADP production. The reverse ecto-AK reaction (2ADP → ATP + AMP) was measured by the rate of [3H]ATP production from [3H]ADP (0.5 μCi). Tritiated ADP and UDP were obtained from their respective nucleoside triphosphates by hexokinase reaction, as described previously (46Lazarowski E.R. Homolya L. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20402-20407Google Scholar). In brief, 50 μCi of either [3H]ATP or [3H]UTP (40–50 Ci/mmol) were incubated with 10 units/ml hexokinase (30 min; 37 °C) in 0.2 ml of KRB. The samples were boiled for 3 min to eliminate hexokinase activity, and full conversion into [3H]ADP or [3H]UDP was confirmed by HPLC. Mucosal epithelial surfaces were rinsed three times with KRB and incubated in KRB (350 μl of mucosal/serosal) during 90 min at 37 °C (5% CO2/95% O2). The conditioned buffer was collected and centrifuged at 14,000 × g (4 °C; 20 min) to remove detached cells, debris, and large organelles. The supernatant was transferred to tubes containing 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (0.1 μCi) or 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (0.1 μCi) + 1 mm AMP in 35 μl KRB for assessment of ATPase and ecto-AK activities in a shaker bath (37 °C). These values were compared with enzyme activities measured the following day on the same cultures to ascertain the contribution of released enzymes to total epithelial surface activity. We established the kinetic properties of the forward and reverse ecto-AK reactions for ATP and ADP, respectively. For the forward reaction, the assays were initiated with 1 mm AMP + 0.001–1 mm[γ-32P]ATP (0.1 μCi), and reaction rates were calculated from [β-32P]ADP production. For the reverse reaction, the assays were initiated with 0.001–1 mm[3H]ADP (0.5 μCi), and reaction rates were calculated from [3H]ATP production. All experiments were conducted on the mucosal surface of human bronchial epithelial cultures, as described above for enzyme assays. Samples were collected after incubation periods that limited substrate hydrolysis to ≤10% and were analyzed by HPLC. Michaelis-Menten constants (K m) and maximal velocities (V max) were obtained from the slope and the ordinate of Woolf-Augustinson Hoftsee transformations, respectively. Catalytic efficiency (Cat eff) was calculated from the velocity (V o) at K mdivided by K m (47Fedde K.N. Lane C.C. Whyte M.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 264: 400-409Google Scholar). The separation system consisted of a Dinamax C-18 column and a mobile phase developed with buffer A (10 mm KH2PO4 and 8 mm tetrabutyl ammonium hydrogen sulfate (TBASH), pH 5.3) from 0 to 10 min, buffer B (100 mmKH2PO4, 8 mm TBASH, and 10% MeOH, pH 5.3) from 10 to 20 min and buffer A from 20 to 30 min. Absorbance was monitored at 254 nm with an on-line Model 490 multiwavelength detector (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD), and radioactivity was determined on-line with a Flo-One Radiomatic β detector (Packard, Canberra, Australia), as described previously (48Lazarowski E.R. Watt W.C. Stutts M.J. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 1619-1627Google Scholar). All 5′-nucleotides and adenosine were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. KH2PO4, TBASH, and HEPES were obtained from Sigma. HPLC-grade water was bought from Fisher Scientific. Cell culture media, bovine serum albumin, bovine pituitary extract, epidermal growth factor, gentamicin, penicillin, retinoic acid, and streptomycin were bought from Invitrogen. [2,83H]ATP (40–50 Ci/mmol), [2,83H]UTP (40–50 Ci/mmol), and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Salts and solvents were of analytical grade. All enzyme assays were performed on primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells obtained from at least five different donors or CF patients. Rates of dephosphorylation were calculated from the initial linear rate of substrate decay monitored by HPLC and presented as nmol·min−1·cm−2. Forward and reverse ecto-AK activities were calculated from initial linear rates of accumulation of the phosphorylated product. Values were expressed as means ± S.E. Unpaired Student'st tests were used to assess the significance between measurements performed on different cultures. Paired T tests were used for comparisons between mucosal and serosal surfaces of the same culture or between conditioned buffer and the corresponding epithelial surface. All linear regressions, curve, fits and data transformations were performed with the PC computer programs Origin and Sigma plot. Polarized bronchial epithelial cultures were assayed for nucleotide metabolism. Fig.1 A presents typical HPLC traces for samples collected 0, 2, and 5 min after the addition of 0.1 mm [3H]ATP to the mucosal surface. The nucleotide was converted into less phosphorylated compounds ([3H]ADP, [3H]AMP, [3H]adenosine) and [3H]inosine. Time course analysis showed that the disappearance of [3H]ATP occurred during the accumulation of [3H]ADP and [3H]AMP (Fig. 1 B). [3H]Adenosine concentration increased over the first 40 min and accounted for 50% of all radioactive species by the end of the experiment. In contrast, reactions initiated with 0.1 mm [3H]ADP indicated that adenine nucleotide metabolism involves other activities besides dephosphorylation. As observed with [3H]ATP, [3H]ADP was converted into less phosphorylated compounds ([3H]AMP, [3H]adenosine) and [3H]inosine (Fig. 1 C). The HPLC traces also revealed the presence of [3H]ATP, suggesting that [3H]ADP was phosphorylated. Time course analysis showed transient accumulation of [3H]AMP and [3H]ATP during the first 30 min, whereas adenosine and inosine concentrations increased during the entire incubation period (Fig. 1 D). These results support a complex interplay between dephosphorylating and phosphorylating activities on human airway epithelial surfaces. We explored the possibility that an ecto-AK was responsible for the phosphorylation of ADP into ATP at the surface of human bronchial epithelial cells. By definition, an AK supports the reversible reaction: ATP + AMP ⇆ 2ADP (for a review, see Ref. 34Van Rompay A.R. Johansson M. Karlsson A. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 87: 189-198Google Scholar). We already demonstrated that these epithelial cultures support the reverse reaction (2ADP → ATP + AMP; Fig. 1, C and D). In the following experiments, we investigated the forward AK reaction (ATP + AMP → 2ADP). Fig. 2 Ashows typical HPLC traces obtained from buffer samples collected 0, 2, and 5 min after the addition of 0.1 mm[γ-32P]ATP to the mucosal surface. The dephosphorylation of [γ-32P]ATP was detected by the accumulation of inorganic phosphate ([32P]Pi). Reactions initiated with 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP + 0.1 mm AMP produced an additional radioactive compound that co-migrated with ADP standards (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that the γ-phosphate group of [γ-32P]ATP was transferred to AMP to produce [β-32P]ADP. These experiments demonstrated that human airway epithelial surfaces exhibit both forward and reverse AK activities. The mucosal surface of human bronchial epithelial cultures and conditioned KRB were assayed for ATPase and AK activities with 1 mm[γ-32P]ATP and 1 mm[γ-32P]ATP + 1 mm AMP, respectively (see “Experimental Procedures”). Similar levels of ATPase and AK activities were detected in the conditioned KRB (Fig.3 A). On the epithelial surface, the rate of [γ-32P]ATP dephosphorylation by ATPase activity was 5-fold higher than the rate of AMP phosphorylation by AK activity (Fig. 3 B). Importantly, released ATPase and AK activities represented ∼3 ± 1% and 11 ± 2% of total surface activity, respectively. The cell surface enzymes, remaining on the bronchial culture after the conditioned KRB was collected, were not eluted by subsequent washes (five rapid changes in KRB). These experiments indicate that the ectoenzymes responsible for the interconversion of phosphate groups between extracellular nucleotides were predominantly associated to the epithelial surface of human bronchial epithelial cells. Human airway ecto-AK exhibited an absolute requirement for divalent cations and adenine nucleotides, as reported for intracellular AKs (34Van Rompay A.R. Johansson M. Karlsson A. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 87: 189-198Google Scholar, 49Hamada M. Sumida M. Okuda H. Watanabe T. Nojima M. Kuby S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13120-13128Google Scholar). Enzyme assays were conducted on the mucosal surface of human bronchial epithelial cultures with 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP + 0.1 mm AMP. The kinase activity was not detected in Mg2+-free KRB containing millimolar Ca2+ (Fig.4 A). The rate of AMP phosphorylation was proportional to the Mg2+ concentration. Fig. 4 B shows that UMP, GMP, and CMP could not substitute for AMP as phosphate acceptor for the forward ecto-AK reaction. In addition, UDP could not substitute for ADP as phosphate donor or acceptor for the reverse ecto-AK reaction (Fig. 4, C andD). Fig. 4 C presents typical HPLC traces for buffer samples collected 0, 5, and 10 min after the addition of 0.1 mm [3H]UDP to the mucosal surface. The nucleotide was gradually dephosphorylated into [3H]UMP and [3H]uridine but was not phosphorylated into [3H]UTP (Fig. 4 D). Taken together, these results indicate the presence of a Mg2+-dependent ecto-AK activity specific for adenine nucleotides at the surface of human bronchial epithelial cells. Experiments were designed to compare the kinetic properties of the forward and reverse ecto-AK reactions on the mucosal surface of human bronchial epithelial cells. The forward reaction was measured with 1 mm AMP + 0.001–1 mm [γ-32P]ATP. Fig.5 A shows that the rate of [β-32P]ADP production increased with substrate concentration and saturated with 0.6 mm[γ-32P]ATP. The reverse reaction was measured with 0.001–3 mm [3H]ADP. The production of [3H]ATP saturated at a higher substrate concentration than the forward reaction (Fig. 5 B; p < 0.05). Woolf-Augustinson Hoftsee analysis indicated that theK m for [γ-32P]ATP was 2-fold lower than for [3H]ADP with corresponding values of 23 ± 5 μm and 43 ± 6 μm, respectively (Fig. 5, A and B, insets;p < 0.05). The V max of the forward reaction was 2-fold higher than for the reverse reaction with values of 1.1 ± 0.1 nmol·min−1·cm−2and 0.5 ± 0.1 nmol·min−1·cm−2, respectively (Fig. 5, A and B, insets;p < 0.05). Calculated Cat effwere 0.025 ± 0.005 min−1 and 0.014 ± 0.002 min−1 for [β-32P]ADP and [3H]ATP production, respectively (p < 0.05). Nucleotide transphosphorylation was detected on both mucosal and serosal surfaces of human bronchial epithelial cultures (Table I). Enzyme assays, performed with saturable substrate concentrations, indicated that forward and reverse activities were 4-fold higher on the mucosal surface (Table I, reactions 1–2; p < 0.01). These experiments also showed that ecto-AK favored AMP phosphorylation by 3-fold over [3H]ADP phosphorylation on both epithelial surfaces (p < 0.01). These results were in agreement with the higher affinity of the enzyme for ATP over ADP (Fig. 5,A and B). The directionality of the reversible ecto-AK reaction suggested that the enzyme could partially circumvent the loss of high energy phosphate groups resulting from dephosphorylation of AMP into adenosine.Table IMeasurements of ecto-adenylate kinase activity at the surface of human bronchial epithelial cellsEnzyme reactionSubstrates (1 mm)ParameterMucosalSerosalnmol/min · cm21.

We evaluated the contribution of ecto-AK to the metabolism of ADP on human bronchial epithelial surfaces with the non-permeant AK inhibitor, diadenosine pentaphosphate (Ap5A (37Nagy A.K. Shuster T.A. Delgado V. J. Neurochem. 1989; 53: 1166-1172Google Scholar)). This dinucleotide was shown to act as competitive inhibitor for the forward AK reaction (ATP + AMP → 2ADP) and non-competitive inhibitor for the reverse AK reaction [2ADP → ATP + AMP] (50Kuby S.A. Hamada M. Gerber D. Tsai W. Jacobs H.K. Cress M.C. Chua G.K. Fleming G. Wu L.L. Fischer A.H. Frischat A. Maland L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 187: 34-52Google Scholar). We tested the impact of Ap5A on the phosphorylation of ADP by human bronchial ecto-AK. Dose-response curves were constructed on mucosal and serosal surfaces with 2 mm [3H]ADP and a range (0–0.5 mm) of Ap5A concentrations. Fig.6 A shows that [3H]ATP production was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner and completely abolished by 0.5 mm Ap5A. In the absence of ecto-AK activity, the pattern of [3H]ADP metabolism (Fig. 6 B) closely resembled the pattern of [3H]UDP metabolism (Fig.4 D). This Ap5A concentration reduced [3H]ADP metabolism by 60–70% on mucosal and serosal surfaces (Fig. 6 C). The possibility remained that this inhibition reflected, at least in part, interactions between Ap5A and ADP-dephosphorylating enzymes reported on these cells (4Donaldson S.H. Lazarowski E.R. Picher M. Knowles M.R. Stutts M.J. Boucher R.C. Mol. Med. 2000; 6: 969-982Google Scholar, 29Picher M. Boucher R.C. Pediatr. Pulmonology Suppl. 1999; 19 (abstr.): 311Google Scholar, 30Picher M.

To address this question, we took advantage of the substrate specificity and ion requirements of ecto-AK (Fig. 4). The hydrolysis of 2 mm[3H]UDP was reduced from 0.73 nmol·min−1·cm−2 to 0.59 nmol·min−1·cm−2 by 0.5 mmAp5A on the mucosal surface (Table I). Since [3H]UDP is not a substrate of ecto-AK (Fig.4 C), the difference between these two reaction rates would represent inhibition of dephosphorylating enzymes by Ap5A (Table I, reaction 8). Similar results were obtained when [3H]ADP metabolism was assayed in Mg2+-free KRB (data not shown), which does not support ecto-AK activities (Fig.4 A). Reverse AK"

In the present study, we obtained cDNAs for two types of human NAD synthetase (referred as NADsyn1 and NADsyn2). Structural analysis revealed in both NADsyn1 and NADsyn2 a domain required for NAD synthesis from ammonia and in only NADsyn1 an additional carbon-nitrogen hydrolase domain shared with enzymes of the nitrilase family that cleave nitriles as well as amides to produce the corresponding acids and ammonia. Consistent with the domain structures, biochemical assays indicated (i) that both NADsyn1 and NADsyn2 have NAD synthetase activity, (ii) that NADsyn1 uses glutamine as well as ammonia as an amide donor, whereas NADsyn2 catalyzes only ammonia-dependent NAD synthesis, and (iii) that mutant NADsyn1 in which Cys-175 corresponding to the catalytic cysteine residue in nitrilases was replaced with Ser does not use glutamine. Kinetic studies suggested that glutamine and ammonia serve as physiological amide donors for NADsyn1 and NADsyn2, respectively. Both synthetases exerted catalytic activity in a multimeric form. In the mouse, NADsyn1 was seen to be abundantly expressed in the small intestine, liver, kidney, and testis but very weakly in the skeletal muscle and heart. In contrast, expression of NADsyn2 was observed in all tissues tested. Therefore, we conclude that humans have two types of NAD synthetase exhibiting different amide donor specificity and tissue distributions. The ammonia-dependent synthetase has not been found in eucaryotes until this study. Our results also indicate that the carbon-nitrogen hydrolase domain is the functional domain of NAD synthetase to make use of glutamine as an amide donor in NAD synthesis. Thus, glutamine-dependent NAD synthetase may be classified as a possible glutamine amidase in the nitrilase family.

The cellular level of NAD may modulate the sensitivity of cells to apoptotic responses through deacetylation of the p53 tumor suppressor by a human homologue of Sir2 (10Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Imai S. Chen D. Su F. Shiloh A. Guarente L. Gu W. Cell. 2001; 107: 137-148Google Scholar). Recent publications have demonstrated that fluctuation of the NAD level in cells seems to have significant impact on their physiology. Despite these significant effects of NAD levels on cellular functions, mechanisms regulating cellular contents of NAD through metabolic events remain to be established. NAD biosynthesis is accomplished through either de novo or salvage pathways (11Foster J.W. Moat A.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1980; 44: 83-105Google Scholar, 12White H.B. Everse J. Anderson B.M. You K.S. Pyridine Nucleotide Coenzyme: Biosynthesis of Salvage Pathways of Pyridine Nucleotide Coenzymes. Academic Press, Inc., New York1982: 1-17Google Scholar). These two pathways converge at the level of an intermediate nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN),1 which is then converted into nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD) through the action of NaMN adenylyltransferase and, lastly, into NAD by NAD synthetase (Fig. 1). Although most of the genes involved in both pathways have been identified in procaryotes (13Tritz G.J. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 557-563Google Scholar), little is known of those genes, including that of NAD synthetase in eucaryotes, except for nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (14Emanuelli M. Carnevali F. Saccucci F. Pierella F. Amici A. Raffaelli N. Magni G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 406-412Google Scholar) and quinolinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (15Fukuoka S. Nyaruhucha C.M. Shibata K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1395: 192-201Google Scholar) genes. NAD synthetase catalyzes the conversion of NaAD into NAD, and NH3 or glutamine is used as an amide donor in the following reactions.NaAD+NH3+ATP→NAD+AMP+PPiREACTION1NaAD+glutamine+ATP→NAD+glutamate+AMP+PPiREACTION2In procaryotes, two types of NAD synthetase have been reported, a type catalyzes Reaction 1 and is strictly ammonia-dependent, whereas the other synthetase catalyzes both Reactions 1 and 2 and uses both ammonia and glutamine as amide donors. Bacillus subtilis synthetase, a representative of the former, is a protein of 271 amino acid residues (16Nessi C. Albertini A.M. Speranza M.L. Galizzi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6181-6185Google Scholar), and crystal structure analysis of the synthetase revealed residues responsible for binding sites for ATP and NaAD (17Rizzi M. Nessi C. Mattevi A. Coda A. Bolognesi M. Galizzi A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5125-5134Google Scholar). Although one of the latter enzymes, Mycobacterium tuberculosis synthetase of 738 amino acids, has been also reported (18Cantoni R. Branzoni M. Labò M. Rizzi M. Riccardi G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3218-3221Google Scholar), the structural basis underlying the potential to use glutamine or ammonia of two types of synthetase has not been determined. In eucaryotes, although NAD synthetase activity of the latter type has been reported (19Yu C.K. Dietrich L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4794-4802Google Scholar, 20Zerez C.R. Wong M.D. Tanaka K.R. Blood. 1990; 75: 1576-1582Google Scholar), molecular cloning and characterization have not been done. In the case of the strictly ammonia-dependent NAD synthetase, the counterpart ofB. subtilis enzyme, even the presence of the activity has not been demonstrated in eucaryotic organisms. We now report molecular identification of two human NAD synthetases, a synthetase that can use not only ammonia but also glutamine and the other synthetase with strictly ammonia-dependent activity (referred as NADsyn1 and NADsyn2, respectively). To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the presence of the strictly ammonia-dependent NAD synthetase in eucaryotes. We also describe the structural basis underlying the potential of NADsyn1 to use glutamine as an amide donor as well as the distinct distribution of NADsyn1 and NADsyn2 in animal tissues. [α-32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. NaAD, AMP and inorganic pyrophosphatase were from Sigma. ATP, NAD, l-glutamine, and ammonium chloride were from Oriental Yeast (Tokyo, Japan), Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Basel, Switzerland), Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan), and Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan), respectively. COS-7 cells and a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60 were obtained from Riken Cell Bank (Tsukuba Science City, Japan). Human glioma cell line LN229 and human hepatocyte cell lines HepG2 and Huh7 were from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). To express NADsyn1 and NADsyn2 as C-terminal-His6-tagged proteins in COS-7 cells, a His6 tag sequence followed by a TGA termination codon was introduced into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) between XbaI and ApaI cloning sites to obtain the pcDNA3His6 vector. Segments of human NADsyn1 cDNA were PCR-amplified from fetal human brain cDNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using two sets of primers, 5′-ATG GGC CGG AAG GTG ACC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAG ACC TGG CAG CAC ATG-3′ (antisense) and 5′-AAG CCT TGG ACC TGC CTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAA GGA ACC GGC CTC A-3′ (antisense). The PCR products were gel-purified, combined, and amplified using primers (the underlined regions correspond to cloning sites) 5′-AAG CTT GGT ACC ATG GGC CGG AAG GTG ACC-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAG CTT TCT AGA GTC CAC GCC GTC CAG GGA-3′ (antisense), yielding full-length NADsyn1 cDNA. Human NADsyn2 cDNA was amplified from LN229 total RNA treated with deoxyribonuclease I (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) by reverse transcription-PCR using primers 5′-AAG CTT GGA TCC ATG CAA GCC GTA CAG CGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAG CTT TCT AGA GGG TGC AAA CGG CAT CAC-3′ (antisense). Amplified cDNAs were digested withKpnI and XbaI for NADsyn1 and BamHI and XbaI for NADsyn2 and ligated, respectively, intoKpnI- and XbaI-digested and BamHI- andXbaI-digested pcDNA3His6. The vector used to express the mutant NADsyn1, in which Cys-175 was replaced with serine (C175S-NADsyn1), was made using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the pcDNA3His6 plasmid vector carrying wild-type NADsyn1 and the oligonucleotide primers 5′-TT GGA AGT GAG ATC agtGAG GAG CTC TGG-3′ and 5′-CCA GAG CTC CTC act GAT CTC ACT TCC AA-3′, where the altered codon is indicated in lowercase italics. The resultant expression plasmids, purified using a Qiagen plasmid kit (Hilden, Germany), were transfected into COS-7 cells (4.5–6.5 × 105 cells/100-mm dish) using an activated-dendrimer PolyFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the COS-7 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and collected by scraping. After the cells were lysed by sonication and centrifugation, recombinant NAD synthetases were purified from the supernatants with His-Bind Resin (Novagen, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A cDNA fragment of mouse glutamine-dependent NAD synthetase was amplified from Balb/c mouse kidney total RNA treated with deoxyribonuclease I by reverse transcription-PCR using primers based on the sequence of mouse homologue of human NADsyn1 (see Fig.7),5′-ATG GGC CGG AAA GTG ACC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAG ACC AGG CAG CAC ATG-3′ (antisense). Sequences of expression plasmids or PCR fragments were confirmed by entire sequencing in both directions. Adaptor-ligated double strand cDNA was synthesized using Marathon cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) from poly(A)+ RNA isolated from HL60 cells with QuickPrepmicro mRNA purification kit (Amersham Biosciences). The 5′ parts of the NADsyn1 and NADsyn2 cDNAs were amplified with Advantage 2 polymerase mix (Clontech) using sense adaptor primer 5′-CCA TCC TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGC-3′ and gene-specific antisense primers 5′-CAG CGC AGC TCG CGG TAG TTG CCT TC-3′ (NADsyn1) and 5′-CCC AGC ACG AAG TCC CGG GAG ACT GC-3′ (NADsyn2). After nested PCR, the products were subcloned into pcDNA3, and positive clones were isolated and sequenced. Unless otherwise stated, NAD synthetase activity of the recombinant protein was based on fluorometric measurements of the NAD formed, as described below. Recombinant NADsyn1, the mutant NADsyn1, and NADsyn2 were incubated with glutamine or NH4Cl as indicated in the reaction mixture (50 μl) containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.8), 2 mm ATP, 1 mm NaAD, 56 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, and 10 μg of bovine serum albumin. For the assay of NADsyn1 activity, 2 mm dithiothreitol was included in the reaction mixture. When glutamine was used as a substrate for NADsyn1, 50 mm Tris-Cl− (pH 7.5) was included instead of 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.8). The reactions were terminated by adding 0.4 ml of 7 n NaOH and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to obtain the fluorescent product (21Zalkin H. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 297-302Google Scholar). The fluorescence was measured using 380 nm for excitation and 460 nm for emission by Fluoroskan Ascent FL (Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland). The fluorescence intensity of standard NAD solutions at known concentrations was used to calculate the amount of NAD. NAD synthetase activity was calculated by subtracting the NAD content of enzyme-deficient blanks from the NAD content of the complete reaction mixture. In some cases NAD synthetase activity was determined by HPLC analysis. After the NAD synthetase reactions had been terminated by a 10-fold dilution with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, the reaction products (NAD, NaAD, and AMP) were separated on a reversed phase Cosmosil 5C-18MS column (4.6 × 150 mm, Nacalai Tesque) with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as the mobile phase and detected by measuring absorbance at 254 nm. Kinetic parameters for NAD synthetase reaction were determined as follows by analysis of a Lineweaver-Burk plot of the initial rates of NAD synthesis. In the reaction mixture at fixed concentrations of two of the three substrates concentrations of the third substrate varied from 0.1 to 2 mm for NaAD, from 0.05 to 1 mmfor ATP, from 1 to 40 mm for glutamine, and from 1.5 to 30 mm (NADsyn1 and C175S-NADsyn1) or from 0.01 to 0.2 mm (NADsyn2) for NH4Cl. In the reaction catalyzed by NADsyn1, K m values for NaAD and ATP were determined using glutamine as an amide donor, whereas in reactions catalyzed by NADsyn2 and C175S-NADsyn1, values were determined using NH4Cl. Amounts of NAD formed were determined by the fluorometric method. NAD synthetase reactions (50 μl) were terminated by adding 8 μl of 10% trifluoroacetic acid. After standing on ice for 15 min and then neutralizing by 1m Tris-Cl− (pH 9.0), the reaction mixtures were incubated with or without 2.5 milliunits/μl of pyrophosphatase at 25 °C for 30 min. The reactions were terminated by 10% perchloric acid, and the inorganic phosphate formed was determined as described by Yu and Dietrich (19Yu C.K. Dietrich L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4794-4802Google Scholar). Purified recombinant NADsyn1 and NADsyn2 were electrophoresed on 7% and 12.5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels, respectively, in Tris-glycine buffer (pH 8.3) (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine) in the presence of 0.2% 2-mercaptoethanol. Gels were sliced into 2–3-mm pieces then incubated in the reaction mixture (100 μl) containing either 20 mm glutamine for NADsyn1 or 1 mm NH4Cl for NADsyn2 at 37 °C for 2 h. NAD formed in the reaction mixture was determined using the fluorometric method, as described above. Total RNAs (20 μg) prepared from Balb/c mouse tissues and human cell lines were fractionated on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and UV-cross-linked. The blot was prehybridized at 43 °C for 5 h in hybridization solution containing 5× SSPE (1× SSPE: 0.15 m NaCl, 8.65 mm sodium dihydrogen phosphate, 1.25 mm EDTA), 50% formamide, 5× Denhardt's solution (1× Denhardt's solution: 0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.02% bovine serum albumin), 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA. The blots were then hybridized at 43 °C for 18 h in the same solution containing heat-denatured cDNA probes (corresponding to amino acids 1–377 of mouse glutamine-dependent NAD synthetase in Fig. 7 or the entire coding region of human NADsyn2 cDNA) labeled by PCR with [α-32P]dCTP and an antisense primer. The membranes were once washed in 2 × SSC (1× SSC: 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015m sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS at 25 °C for 15 min, then twice with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for hybridization with the mouse glutamine-dependent NAD synthetase cDNA or 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for with NADsyn2 cDNA and exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C with an intensifying screen. Under these conditions, NADsyn2 probe did not detect the 3.1-kb message (see Fig.6 B). RNA integrity and loading were assessed using a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe. Using the deduced amino acid sequence of B. subtilis NAD synthetase (16Nessi C. Albertini A.M. Speranza M.L. Galizzi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6181-6185Google Scholar) (SWISS-PROT accession number P08164) as a probe, we found two candidate sequences encoding human NAD synthetase, GenBankTM accession numbers AK001493 and HSA236685 in a homology search analysis. Using primers corresponding to the presumed 5′- and 3′-terminal sequences of the candidates, we carried out reverse transcription-PCR as described under “Experimental Procedures” and obtained two human cDNA clonesNADsyn1 and NADsyn2, encoding proteins of 706 and 275 amino acids, respectively. To ensure the correct prediction of the open reading frames, we amplified sequences containing 5′ upstream regions of the cDNAs using 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. In the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends products, we confirmed sequences corresponding to the sense primers used for amplification of the cDNAs. In 5′ upstream region of NADsyn1 cDNA (92 bp) we amplified we did not observe in-frame stop codon but found that the presumed start methionine codon was in a favorable Kozak initiation sequence AGGATGG (22Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Google Scholar), and the codon was the first in-frame methionine codon. For NADsyn2, we obtained an in-frame stop codon 6 bp upstream of the presumed initiation codon. Thus, we concluded that NADsyn1 and NADsyn2 encode complete coding regions of the respective proteins. In a search of known functional domains and motifs in protein structures, we identified the NAD_synthase domain (Pfam accession number PF02540 http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/) and an ATP binding site (SGGXDS, P-loop), a conserved sequence fingerprint of a family of ATP-pyrophosphatases, including NAD synthetase (23Tesmer J.J.G. Klem T.J. Deras M.L. Davisson V.J. Smith J.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 74-86Google Scholar), in both NADsyn2 and the C-terminal half of NADsyn1 (Fig.2, A and B). A careful sequence comparison showed that most of the residues forming ATP binding (Ser-46, Asp-50, and Ser-51) and NaAD binding sites (Arg-137, Leu-153, Glu-162, Thr-169, Asp-173, Lys-186, Leu-211, His-257 and Lys-258) in B. subtilis synthetase (16Nessi C. Albertini A.M. Speranza M.L. Galizzi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6181-6185Google Scholar) are strictly conserved in both NADsyn1 and NADsyn2 (Fig. 2 B). These observations suggest that cDNAs for NADsyn1 and NADsyn2 encode NAD synthetases. We designated the NAD_synthase domain and the P-loop motif as the synthetase domain. In addition to the synthetase domain, NADsyn1 only had the carbon-nitrogen hydrolase (CN_hydrolase) domain (Pfam accession number PF00795) at the N-terminal half (Fig. 2 A). The CN_hydrolase domain, with a cysteine residue essential for nitrilase activity (24Kobayashi M. Yanaka N. Nagasawa T. Yamada H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9000-9007Google Scholar,25Kobayashi M. Izui H. Nagasawa T. Yamada H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 247-251Google Scholar), is shared with enzymes belonging to the nitrilase family that cleave nitriles as well as amides to produce the corresponding acids and ammonia (Fig. 2 C) (26Bork P. Koonin E.V. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1344-1346Google Scholar, 27Novo C. Tata R. Clemente A. Brown P.R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 275-279Google Scholar). Because B. subtilis synthetase, which lacks the CN_hydrolase domain (Fig.2 A), utilizes ammonia but not glutamine (16Nessi C. Albertini A.M. Speranza M.L. Galizzi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6181-6185Google Scholar), the presence of the CN_hydrolase domain in NADsyn1 but not in NADsyn2 suggested that the former enzyme uses both glutamine and ammonia in NAD synthesis, whereas the latter is strictly ammonia-dependent. Furthermore, because the critical cysteine residue in the CN_hydrolase domain was also conserved in NADsyn1 at a position of 175 (Fig.2 C), the cysteine (Cys-175) in NADsyn1 was considered to be essential for the use of glutamine. From these sequence analyses, we speculated (i) that both NADsyn1 and NDsyn2 have NAD synthetase activity, (ii) that NADsyn1 uses not only ammonia but also glutamine, whereas NADsyn2 uses only ammonia, and (iii) that the site-directed mutagenesis of Cys-175 in NADsyn1 eliminates glutamine-dependent NAD synthetase activity with the ammonia-dependent activity intact. We next expressed NADsyn1, NADsyn2, and a mutant NADsyn1 in which Cys-175 was replaced with serine (C175S-NADsyn1) in COS-7 cells as His6-tagged recombinant proteins, and we purified these proteins on nickel chelate resin. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that the purified wild-type (Fig.3 A, inset) and mutant NADsyn1 (data not shown) have a molecular mass of 80 kDa, in accordance with the value calculated from the deduced sequences, 80.3 kDa. The purified recombinant NADsyn2 appeared as a single band with a molecular mass of 34 kDa (Fig. 3 B, inset), slightly larger than the value calculated from the deduced sequence, 30.8 kDa. The difference may depend on the low pI of the recombinant protein (pI 5.9). To investigate whether NADsyn1, NADsyn2, and C175S-NADsyn1 have the predicted enzymatic activities, we incubated the purified recombinant proteins with glutamine or NH4Cl in the presence of NaAD and ATP then determined the NAD synthetase activities of the proteins using a fluorometric method. As shown in Fig.4 A, the recombinant wild-type NADsyn1 exhibited almost the same activity with either glutamine or NH4Cl. On the other hand, the recombinant NADsyn2 catalyzed NAD synthesis primarily with NH4Cl (Fig. 4 C). In marked contrast with the wild-type NADsyn1, the activity of the mutant NADsyn1 (C175S-NADsyn1) was not detected when glutamine was used as a substrate, whereas the activity remained unaltered with NH4Cl (Fig. 4 B). Kinetic analysis indicated that NADsyn1 shows a lower K m for glutamine (1.44 mm) than for NH4Cl (13.1 mm) (Table I). Compared with NADsyn1, NADsyn2 showed a much lower K m for NH4Cl (34 μm) but a much higher K m for glutamine (103 mm) (Table I). NADsyn1 and NADsyn2 showed essentially the same K m values for ATP and NaAD, in the range of those reported for native synthetases (16Nessi C. Albertini A.M. Speranza M.L. Galizzi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6181-6185Google Scholar, 19Yu C.K. Dietrich L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4794-4802Google Scholar). Kinetic parameters of the mutant NADsyn1 obtained with NH4Cl did not differ from those of the wild-type NADsyn1, which suggests that disappearance of the glutamine dependence was not because of a drastic change in the tertiary structure of NADsyn1. Compared with NADsyn2 (34 μm), the mutant synthetase exhibited a much higherK m value for NH4Cl (23.9 mm). With the glutamine preparation, which contained up to 0.38% ammonia in itself, the concentration of ammonia in the assay solution in Fig. 4 would be up to 76 μm. Thus, under these conditions NADsyn2 but not the mutant synthetase could synthesize NAD without exogenously added ammonia (Fig. 4), as was seen with theB. subtilis synthetase (16Nessi C. Albertini A.M. Speranza M.L. Galizzi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6181-6185Google Scholar).Table IKinetic parameters in NAD synthetase reactions catalyzed by the wild-type and mutant NADsyn1 and NADsyn2EnzymesSubstratesK mV maxmmnmol/min/μgNADsyn1NaAD0.49 ± 0.060.99 ± 0.30ATP0.089 ± 0.0230.61 ± 0.19Glutamine1.44 ± 0.170.70 ± 0.18NH4Cl13.1 ± 1.21.04 ± 0.18C175SNaAD0.20 ± 0.040.54 ± 0.10ATP0.12 ± 0.090.53 ± 0.10Glutamine–aNAD synthetase activity was below the limit of detection, and thus, the K m value was not determined.–aNAD synthetase activity was below the limit of detection, and thus, the K m value was not determined.NH4Cl23.9 ± 6.70.98 ± 0.23NADsyn2NaAD0.13 ± 0.021.57 ± 0.32ATP0.40 ± 0.061.62 ± 0.26Glutamine103 ± 17.41.72 ± 0.15NH4Cl0.034 ± 0.011.37 ± 0.52The kinetic parameters were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” K m andV max values represent the mean ± S.D. of three separate experiments.a NAD synthetase activity was below the limit of detection, and thus, the K m value was not determined. Open table in a new tab The kinetic parameters were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” K m andV max values represent the mean ± S.D. of three separate experiments. All these results are consistent with our predictions (i) that both NADsyn1 and NADsyn2 have NAD synthetase activity, (ii) that NADsyn1 utilizes not only ammonia but also glutamine as an amide donor, whereas NADsyn2 is primarily an ammonia-dependent NAD synthetase, and (iii) that Cys-175 in NADsyn1 is essential for the ability to use glutamine as an amide donor. In agreement with our sequence analyses noted above, we therefore conclude that the CN_hydrolase domain in the N-terminal half of NADsyn1, in particular Cys-175, is responsible for utilization of glutamine as an amide donor and, thus, confers glutamine dependence on the synthetase, whereas the synthetase domain in NADsyn1 and NADsyn2 participates solely in NAD synthesis from ammonia. To further confirm the role of the CN_hydrolase domain in using glutamine, we made a chimera consisting of the N-terminal region of NADsyn1 and NADsyn2 as well as a construct containing solely the N- or C-terminal half of NADsyn1. However, because of their insufficient expressions, we could not characterize these constructs (data not shown). We next examined the stoichiometry of the reactions catalyzed by the recombinant synthetases. The purified recombinant NADsyn1 and NADsyn2 were incubated with glutamine and NH4Cl, respectively, in the presence of NaAD and ATP and the reaction products were analyzed by reversed phase HPLC. As shown in Fig. 5, 1 nmol of AMP and PPi was produced per 1 nmol of NAD synthesized during the reaction catalyzed by each synthetase. These results indicate that amidation of NaAD by the recombinant enzymes is associated with ATP cleavage to AMP and PPi, as noted for the native enzyme (28Spencer R.L. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 385-392Google Scholar). Omission of either ATP, Mg2+, NaAD, or amide donors from the reaction mixture resulted in a complete loss of NAD synthesis by each enzyme (data not shown). To examine whether catalytically active forms of human NADsyn1 and NADsyn2 are multimers as native synthetases (16Nessi C. Albertini A.M. Speranza M.L. Galizzi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6181-6185Google Scholar, 19Yu C.K. Dietrich L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4794-4802Google Scholar, 20Zerez C.R. Wong M.D. Tanaka K.R. Blood. 1990; 75: 1576-1582Google Scholar), we fractionated the purified recombinant synthetases by non-denaturing PAGE and determined NAD synthetase activity in gel slices. As shown in Fig. 3, activities of NADsyn1 and NADsyn2 had mobilities consistent with proteins of 500 and 70 kDa, respectively, suggesting that NADsyn1 and NADsyn2 may exist as a homohexamer and a homodimer, respectively. To evaluate the tissue distribution of NADsyn1 and NADsyn2, Northern blot analyses were done with total RNA from various mouse tissues and several human cell lines. As shown in Fig. 6 A, a message of 3.1 kb was detected for NADsyn1, with various intensities. The major sites of NADsyn1 gene expression were the small intestine, kidney, liver, and testis, whereas the skeletal muscle, spleen, lung, heart, and brain showed a weak signal. In the liver and small intestine, an additional signal was observed at 2.1 kb. The NADsyn1 gene was also expressed in human glioma (LN229) and promyelocytic leukemia (HL60) cell lines (data not shown). Although an EST data base homology search did not reveal a human clone with a high degree of similarity toNADsyn2, Northern blot analysis clearly showed that an mRNA species of 1.4 kb is expressed in human cells LN229, HL60, and HepG2 and Huh7 (hepatocyte cell lines) (Fig. 6 B). In the mouse, all of the tissues tested expressed the 1.4-kb mRNA, probably representing a mouse homologue of NADsyn2. In the lung and in skeletal muscle, the same 1.4-kb signal was observed after long exposure of the blot (data not shown). In mouse brain and kidney and human cell lines an additional 2.6-kb mRNA species was observed. The deduced amino acid sequences of NADsyn1 and NADsyn2 showed mismatches of three and four amino acids, respectively, compared with those deposited in GenBankTM data base (AK001493 and HSA236685, respectively) (Figs. 7 and 2 B). A homology search in a protein data base revealed that NADsyn1 exhibits significant amino acid identity to several eucaryotic putative proteins from the mouse (83%), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (58%),Drosophila melanogaster (53%) and C. elegans(46%) (Fig. 7). Alignment of the NADsyn1 sequence with these proteins showed that there are highly conserved regions among the five proteins, including ATP and NaAD binding sites in the C-terminal regions and the essential cysteine residues for use of glutamine in the N-terminal halves. The CN_hydrolase domain of NADsyn1 also showed sequence similarity to NAD synthetases from M. tuberculosis (18Cantoni R. Branzoni M. Labò M. Rizzi M. Riccardi G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3218-3221Google Scholar) andRhodobacter capsulatus (29Willison J.C. Tissot G. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3400-3402Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 C), and in particular, the critical cysteine residues were strictly conserved in the two bacterial synthetases. NADsyn2 did not exhibit significant sequence similarity to any other eucaryotic proteins over the entire length. The present study is the first identification of open reading frames encoding two NAD synthetases, NADsyn1 and NADsyn2, in humans. Heterologous expression of the synthetases indicated that although NADsyn1 utilizes both glutamine and ammonia as amide donors, ammonia may not serve as a physiological amide donor for NADsyn1in vivo (K m for NH4Cl >10 mm). In marked contrast, NADsyn2 uses ammonia more efficiently than does NADsyn1 (K m for NH4Cl = 34 μm) but appears to be unable to use glutamine as a physiological amide donor (K mfor glutamine >100 mm). Thus, we conclude that NADsyn1 is a glutamine-dependent NAD synthetase, whereas NADsyn2 is a strictly ammonia-dependent synthetase. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence for the presence of an ammonia-dependent NAD synthetase in eucaryotes. Furthermore, by comparing the catalytic activity of NADsyn2, which lacks CN_hydrolase domain, with the mutant NADsyn1, in which Cys-175 corresponding to the catalytic cysteine residue in nitrilases (24Kobayashi M. Yanaka N. Nagasawa T. Yamada H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9000-9007Google Scholar, 25Kobayashi M. Izui H. Nagasawa T. Yamada H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 247-251Google Scholar) was replaced with Ser, we identified the CN_hydrolase domain as the functional domain of NAD synthetase to abstract nitrogen from the amide of glutamine and, thus, to use glutamine as an amide donor. Identification of the CN_hydrolase domain as the determinant of glutamine dependence means that the homologues of human NADsyn1 found in different species are also glutamine-dependent NAD synthetases. The domain occurring in the NAD synthetase from M. tuberculosis, known to catalyze NAD synthesis with glutamine (18Cantoni R. Branzoni M. Labò M. Rizzi M. Riccardi G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3218-3221Google Scholar), now provides the previously unrecognized structural basis underlying the glutamine dependence of the synthetase. These results suggest that the glutamine-dependent NAD synthetases can be classified as a possible glutamine amidase into the nitrilase family. In the nitrilases, an invariant cysteine residue has been proposed to act as a nucleophile in the catalytic mechanism, where a nitrile carbon is subjected to a nucleophilic attack by sulfhydryl group in the active site of the enzyme (24Kobayashi M. Yanaka N. Nagasawa T. Yamada H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9000-9007Google Scholar, 25Kobayashi M. Izui H. Nagasawa T. Yamada H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 247-251Google Scholar). Because the critical cysteine residue in the nitrilases is conserved in these glutamine-dependent NAD synthetases, the cysteine residues in the synthetases probably carry out a nucleophilic attack on a carbonyl carbon of glutamine, abstracting ammonia from glutamine. In the synthetase domains of these synthetases, after adenylation of NaAD in the presence of ATP, the ammonia thus abstracted in the CN_hydrolase domain attacks the adenylated NaAD, resulting in NAD, as proposed (28Spencer R.L. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 385-392Google Scholar). X-ray diffraction analysis and a detailed structure-functional analysis of NADsyn1 will give a better understanding of the catalytic mechanism of these glutamine-dependent NAD synthetases. We showed that NADsyn1 exerts catalytic activity in a multimeric form. NAD synthetases purified from human erythrocytes and yeast, glutamine-dependent and, thus, expected to possess CN_hydrolase domain, are also multimeric enzymes (19Yu C.K. Dietrich L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4794-4802Google Scholar, 20Zerez C.R. Wong M.D. Tanaka K.R. Blood. 1990; 75: 1576-1582Google Scholar). It has been reported that nitrilase family members form a multimer, probably by subunit contact through highly hydrophobic regions conserved in the CN_hydrolase domain (26Bork P. Koonin E.V. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1344-1346Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 C). Thus, it appears that the CN_hydrolase domain, including hydrophobic regions, participates in multimer formation of NADsyn1. Glutamine-dependent yeast NAD synthetase has been reported to have two components, an 80-kDa ammonia-dependent NAD synthetase subunit and an additional 65-kDa subunit, and the latter has been hypothesized to use glutamine as amide donor (19Yu C.K. Dietrich L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4794-4802Google Scholar, 30Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 87-144Google Scholar). However, because the yeast homologue of human NADsyn1 with a calculated molecular mass of 80.7 kDa has the CN_hydrolase domain, it seems that the 80-kDa subunit solely represents the yeast synthetase, and it is unlikely that the 65-kDa subunit is required for glutamine-dependent NAD synthetase activity. The wide variability of NADsyn1 expression revealed by Northern blot analysis may reflect differences in NAD demand among animal tissues. Abundant expression of NADsyn1 was observed in the small intestine, liver, kidney, and testis, whereas skeletal muscle and the heart showed very weak signals. However, nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase, catalyzing the formation of the substrate of NAD synthetase NaAD (Fig. 1), has been reported to be expressed mainly in skeletal muscle and the heart (14Emanuelli M. Carnevali F. Saccucci F. Pierella F. Amici A. Raffaelli N. Magni G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 406-412Google Scholar), thus being inconsistent with NADsyn1 expression. This raises the question of how NAD synthesis occurs in these tissues. NADsyn2 is expressed in skeletal muscle and in the heart. In these tissues, gene expression of glutaminase catalyzing the formation of ammonia from glutamine has also been demonstrated (31Elgadi K.M. Meguid R.A. Qian M. Souba W.W. Abcouwer S.F. Physiol.

Taken together the finding that NADsyn2 could catalyze NAD synthesis using ammonia as an amide donor, NADsyn2 may largely mediate NAD synthesis in these tissues. Alternatively, based on a somewhat higher affinity of nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase for NMN than for NaMN (14Emanuelli M. Carnevali F. Saccucci F. Pierella F. Amici A. Raffaelli N. Magni G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 406-412Google Scholar), NAD may also be synthesized via direct conversion of NMN to NAD in the tissues. For a better understanding of the regulation of NAD biosynthesis in higher organisms, including humans, further analyses on quinolinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase and nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase expression in animal tissues are under investigation. In the present study, we identified glutamine- and ammonia-dependent human NAD synthetases, NADsyn1 and NADsyn2, respectively, with distinct tissue distribution of the synthetases, and we obtained evidence that the CN_hydrolase domain confers glutamine dependence on the former enzyme. Our results suggest that the glutamine-dependent NAD synthetase is classified as a glutamine amidase into the nitrilase family and that the newly identified metabolic pathway involving the ammonia-dependent NAD synthetase plays a role in NAD biosynthesis. These are important clues to better understand detailed structures fundamental to catalytic activity of the enzyme and to elucidate regulatory mechanisms of cellular NAD metabolism. We thank K.

https://openalex.org/W2112108753,"The regional distribution, developmental profiles, and gonadectomy- and estrogen-induced changes in the density of transcripts encoding the steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) were examined in the female rat brain by semiquantitative in situ hybridization. The results demonstrate striking differences in the abundance of SRC-1 mRNA in discrete brain regions throughout ontogeny. Whereas transcript densities gradually decreased with age in the cerebral cortex, they peaked prominently during the peripubertal period in the hypothalamic medial preoptic area (MPOA) and ventromedial nucleus (VMN). Gonadectomy and estrogen substitution influenced SRC-1 mRNA levels in sexually mature animals in a region-specific fashion. Ovariectomy resulted in a down-regulation of SRC-1 mRNA levels in the VMN, a brain region richly endowed with estrogen receptors and playing a major role in neuroendocrine control of reproductive functions. In contrast, SRC-1 transcript levels were significantly up-regulated after estradiol treatment. Interestingly, SRC-1 expression in the cortex was refractory to alterations of the estrogen milieu. The obtained SRC-1 mRNA expression profiles during development clearly demonstrate brain region specificity and regulation by estrogen, thus it is proposed that SRC-1 amplifies estrogen receptor-dependent transcription in a temporally and spatially coordinated manner and therefore contributes to the functional specialization of brain areas involved in the regulation of reproduction."
https://openalex.org/W2147616657,"Immunohistochemistry using novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) allowed us to uncover tissue activities of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) fine tuned by NO and CO. Upon NO and CO applications in vitro, purified sGC increased the affinity to mAb3221 by 100- and 10-fold, respectively, but not to mAb28131. Immunohistochemistry for gas-generating enzymes revealed that NO occurred in amacrine, bipolar, and Müller's glia cells (MGCs), whereas CO was derived mostly from heme oxygenase (HO)-2 in MGCs. Basal sGC immunoreactivities in vivo to mAb3221 but not to mAb28131 were enhanced by injecting L-arginine and attenuated by blocking NO synthases, suggesting the ability of the former mAb to sense NO. Comparison of mAb-assisted immunohistochemistry suggested that sGC activities were enhanced by zinc protoporphyrin-IX, an HO inhibitor, and repressed completely by blocking NO. However, suggested roles of CO played in situ varied among different retinal layers. In inner plexiform and inner nuclear layers located in the proximity of the cellular NO sources, CO serves as a simple inhibitor of local sGC, while playing roles in housekeeping sGC activation in external limiting membrane standing far from them. These results suggest that CO generated in MGCs is a diffusible gas mediator regulating sGC in both autocrine and paracrine manners."
https://openalex.org/W2010206194,"Vascular endothelial cell (VEC) proliferation is a key event in angiogenesis and is tightly regulated. Electric potential differences exist around the vascular endothelium and give rise to endogenous electric fields (EFs), whether these EFs influence VEC proliferation is unclear. We exposed cultured VECs to applied EFs of physiological strengths for up to 72 h. EF at 50 or 100 mV/mm did not influence cell proliferation, but at 200 mV/mm, cell density, cell growth rate, and mitosis index decreased significantly. EF-induced reduction in VEC proliferation was not due to increased apoptosis, because caspase apoptosis inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (20 microM), had no effect on this response. Rather, EF responses were mediated via decreased entry of cells into S phase from G1 phase, as shown by flow cytometry. Western blot showed that EFs decreased G1-specific cyclin E expression and increased cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase complex inhibitor p27kipl expression. Thus EFs controlled VEC proliferation through induction of cell cycle arrest at G1 by down-regulation of cyclin E expression and up-regulation of p27kipl expression, rather than by promoting apoptosis. If control of the cell cycle by endogenous EFs extends beyond VECs, this would be of widespread biological significance in vivo."

At the cellular level, apoAI is capable of triggering a cascade of intracellular events, leading to transport of stored cholesterol to the cell surface. ApoAI then acquires lipids including cholesterol to form mature HDL. ApoAI-mediated cholesterol efflux is thus the key step in the maintenance of healthy levels of HDL in human. This process is absent in a genetic disorder, Tangier disease, due to functional mutations in ABCA1 (1Brooks-Wilson A. Marcil M. Clee S.M. Zhang L.H. Roomp K. van Dam M. Yu L. Brewer C. Collins J.A. Molhuizen H.O. Loubser O. Ouelette B.F. Fichter K. Ashbourne-Excoffon K.J. Sensen C.W. Scherer S. Mott S. Denis M. Martindale D. Frohlich J. Morgan K. Koop B. Pimstone S. Kastelein J.J. Hayden M.R. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 336-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar). Tangier patients develop extensive lipid accumulations in various tissues, extremely low HDL-C levels, and elevated risk for coronary artery disease. ABCA1 is found predominantly in the Golgi and the plasma membrane including endosomes in various cell types. The molecular mechanism by which ABCA1 governs cholesterol efflux is not well understood. Nor is the pathway by which cholesterol is transported to the cell surface for efflux. The net effect of apoAI-mediated efflux is to eliminate excess cholesterol from the cell. Intracellular cholesterol transport during the process is thought to be initiated from lipid droplets to the plasma membrane (2Oram J.F. Yokoyama S. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2473-2491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular cholesterol plays a critical role in several important cell functions, including protein trafficking, membrane vesiculation, and signal transduction (3Anderson R.G. Jacobson K. Science. 2002; 296: 1821-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells have developed highly sophisticated mechanisms to ensure adequate cholesterol levels. Plasma membrane cholesterol content, for example, is regulated through a feedback mechanism controlled by sterol regulatory element binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) (4Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). SREBP-2 senses membrane cholesterol levels and regulates the transcription of genes encoding proteins required for endogenous cholesterol synthesis and uptake of plasma lipoproteins. Under most circumstances SREBP-2 can effectively control cellular cholesterol levels. There are, however, situations in which large amounts of cholesterol are taken into cells by other pathways involving receptors not regulated by SREBP-2. This leads to accumulation of intracellular cholesterol. To maintain normal cell function, most mammalian cells are capable of sequestering excess cholesterol into the lipid droplets as a temporary relief. Cholesterol may be used as additional energy source in the future. It is, however, far more common in modern societies that the this storage system is overloaded, leading to macrophage foam cell formation with potentially lethal effects due to the build-up of unstable coronary artery plaque. It is thus critical that the storage capacity be efficiently renewed by the removal of excess cholesterol from cells. ApoAI-mediated efflux is by far the most significant process to remove excess lipid, including cholesterol, under physiological conditions. How stored cholesterol in the lipid droplets reaches apoAI on the cell surface during this process is not clear at present. As cholesterol is known to actively shuttle between the lipid droplets and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (2Oram J.F. Yokoyama S. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2473-2491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that stored cholesterol is first released from lipid droplets into the ER and from there to the cell surface to interact with apoAI. The secretory vesicular pathway is thus likely involved in transporting lipids including cholesterol to the plasma membrane. As many lipids are known to be transported from the Golgi to the plasma membrane exclusively through vesicular mechanisms, we hypothesized that the Golgi may play a role in transporting newly released cholesterol to the plasma membrane during apoAI-mediated efflux and ABCA1 may influence this pathway. We therefore took advantage of recent development in green fluorescent proteins (GFP) techniques and designed a series of experiments to quantitatively measure whether vesicular transport in secretory pathway is affected when cells are actively pumping cholesterol to apoAI on the cell surface. We also investigated whether vesicular transport is affected in response to apoAI in Tangier cells with functional mutations in ABCA1. We report here that there is enhanced vesicular transport from the Golgi to the plasma membrane in cells in which cholesterol efflux is elicited by exposure to apoAI. This enhanced vesicular transport was not observed in Tangier cells. Brefeldin A (BFA) and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) were purchased from Molecular Probes. Yellow fluorescent protein-vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (YFP-VSVG) and yellow fluorescent protein-glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein (YFP-GPI) in adenoviral vectors were gifts from Drs. P. Keller and K. Simons, EBI. Recombinant apoAI was obtained from Drs. R. Kiss and Y. Marcel, Ottawa University Heart Institute. Cholesterol efflux was performed using J774 macrophages and human primary fibroblasts (from a normal individual and a Tangier patient). The Tangier patient is a compound heterozygote in which one allele gives the mutation C1477R and the other one is a Gly → Cys mutation at an exon/intron boundary, causing a splice site mutation and thus a truncated mRNA (5Mott S. Yu L. Marcil M. Boucher B. Rondeau C. Genest J. Atherosclerosis. 2000; 152: 457-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Cells were cholesterol-loaded with acetyl-low density lipoprotein (75 μg/ml) for 1–2 days along with [3H]cholesterol. Cells were then changed into medium containing 8-Br-cAMP (50 μm) and BSA (2 mg/ml) overnight. Cholesterol efflux was induced by incubating cells with 10 μg/ml apoAI for various time. The medium was then collected and counted for [3H]cholesterol. In BFA experiments, cells were preincubated 15 min with BFA (10 μg/ml) before apoAI. BFA was present throughout the efflux period. Cells were then lysed and counted for total cellular [3H]cholesterol. Efflux is presented as percentage [3H]cholesterol in the medium of total cellular [3H]cholesterol. Macrophages and fibroblasts were loaded with cholesterol and treated with cAMP/BSA over night. Cells were then transfected with YFP proteins using adenoviral vectors. For the transport from the Golgi to the plasma membrane, transfected cells were incubated at 19.5 °C for 2–4 h to accumulate YFP protein in the Golgi. Cycloheximide was added for the last 30 min of the incubation to stop further protein synthesis. Cells were than moved to 32 °C to allow the transport from the Golgi to the plasma membrane in the presence or absence of apoAI. For quantitative transport measurement, cells were fixed at the end of the 32 °C incubation with 4% paraformaldehyde and analyzed by quantitative fluorescent microscopy. To measure the transport of YFP proteins, fluorescent images of fixed cells were acquired on an Olympus IX70 microscope using a 40× (NA 0.75) objective and a 12-bit CCD digital camera IMAGO. For Golgi to plasma membrane transport, an average fluorescent intensity in the Golgi area was measured using TILLvisION software. After background correction, Golgi fluorescence intensity was ratioed to the average fluorescent intensity from whole cell to give an indication of the rate of transport in that cell. For each treatment, 50–200 individual cells were imaged and quantified. To test whether the Golgi is indeed involved in apoAI-mediated cholesterol efflux, we first examined the effect of BFA in the process. BFA disassembles the Golgi and redistributes it into the ER. This leads to a complete inhibition in secretory vesicular transport (6Sciaky N. Presley J. Smith C. Zaal K.J. Cole N. Moreira J.E. Terasaki M. Siggia E. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1137-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). In J774 macrophages, we found that cholesterol efflux is sensitive to BFA. When treated with BFA the Golgi was dissembled within 10 min (not shown), and there was about 50% inhibition of apoAI-mediated cholesterol efflux during 2 h following BFA treatment (Fig.1 a). Cholesterol efflux from human primary fibroblasts was similarly affected and, as expected, Tangier fibroblasts failed to produce any cholesterol efflux treated with or without BFA (Fig. 1 b). Prolonged BFA treatment (>4 h) produces much more severe inhibition in both macrophages and fibroblasts (not shown), in agreement with previous observations (7Mendez A.J. Uint L. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2510-2524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BFA effects within 2 h are likely due to specific blockage of vesicular transport. The inhibition by BFA thus suggests that apoAI-mediated efflux involves a vesicular process in the secretory pathway. Cholesterol is relatively enriched in the plasma membrane and in the Golgi (8Mukherjee S. Zha X. Tabas I. Maxfield F.R. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1915-1925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). It is believed that cholesterol/sphingomyelin-rich membrane domains (rafts) are first formed in the Golgi and, from there, transported to the plasma membrane. Golgi to plasma membrane vesicular transport could be used to transport lipid including cholesterol to the cell surface during apoAI-mediated efflux. We therefore measured the rate of vesicular transport from the Golgi to the plasma membrane in cells undergoing apoAI-mediated cholesterol efflux and compared it with cells treated identically but without exposure to apoAI. In non-polarized cells, membrane vesicles budding from the Golgi are known to have at least two distinct populations, namely raft-rich and raft-poor vesicles in terms of their membrane lipid compositions. Each population of vesicles is known to carry a specific set of cargo proteins. To accurately estimate overall membrane vesicular movement from the Golgi to the plasma membrane, we chose two well characterized markers, a raft-associated YFP-GPI and a non-raft-associated YFP-VSVG. This allowed us to target both vesicle populations, respectively (9Keller P. Toomre D. Diaz E. White J. Simons K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 140-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). These proteins were expressed using adenovirus vectors and accumulated in the Golgi by a 19.5 °C temperature block (Fig.2 a, top row). Upon switching to 32 °C, YFP-GPI or YFP-VSVG entered budding vesicles, exited the Golgi, and moved to the plasma membrane. The rate of transport was measured in individual cells by quantifying YFP fluorescence intensities in the Golgi as a function of time. In cholesterol-loaded J774 macrophages, we found that, after switching temperature to 32 °C for 10 min, YFP fluorescent intensity in the Golgi decreased more rapidly in cells undergoing efflux (+ apoAI), when compared with control cells (− apoAI). Correspondingly, there was more YFP-GPI on the plasma membrane in cell exposed to apoAI (Fig. 2 a,bottom row, right panel). Quantitative analysis from a large number of individual cells further confirmed that the transport of YFP-GPI from the Golgi to the plasma membrane was significantly increased in cells incubated with apoAI (Fig.2 b, gray line) relative to control cells (Fig.2 b, black line). T 12for YFP-GPI transport from the Golgi to the plasma membrane was about 10 min in the presence of apoAI and 20 min in the absence of apoAI. This indicates that, when these macrophages are actively pumping lipids including cholesterol out of the cells (+ apoAI), vesicular transport from the Golgi is up-regulated. As more vesicles are fused with the plasma membrane, more lipids are delivered to the cell surface. To further verify this, we performed similar experiments using YFP-GPI in cholesterol-loaded normal primary fibroblasts. These cells are also capable of mobilizing cholesterol when exposed to apoAI (Fig.1 b). Under these conditions (+ apoAI), we indeed observed an enhanced Golgi to plasma membrane transport in comparison with cells under control conditions (− apoAI) (Fig.3 a), similar to what was observed in macrophages. To confirm that increased vesicular transport in the presence of apoAI is related to cholesterol efflux, we then measured Golgi to plasma membrane transport in Tangier fibroblasts. These cells are incapable of apoAI-mediated cholesterol efflux due to functional ABCA1 mutations (Fig. 1 b). Indeed, we could not detect any change in vesicular transport in Tangier cells when these cells were incubated with apoAI (Fig. 3 a). This observation was further supported by biochemical analysis. YFP-GPI on the cell surface can be cleaved by a membrane-impermeable PI-PLC to release YFP to the medium (10Cross G.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts were transfected with YFP-GPI and underwent a 19.5 °C temperature block to accumulate YFP-GPI in the Golgi. Cells were then switched to 32 °C for 20 min. PI-PLC was applied to cleave the GPI protein that had reached cell surface during 32 °C incubation, and media were collected to quantify YFP using a scanning spectrofluorometer. Consistent with our imaging analysis with individual cells, we found twice as much YFP in the medium from normal fibroblasts exposed to apoAI relative to control (− apoAI) (Fig. 3 b). Tangier cells again showed no response to apoAI (Fig. 3 b). The increased YFP-GPI transport from the Golgi to the plasma membrane in the presence of apoAI is therefore associated with functional ABCA1 and cholesterol efflux. We also analyzed the rate of transport from the Golgi to the plasma membrane using YFP-VSVG, a non-raft protein. YFP-VSVG was again expressed in fibroblasts and incubated at 19.5 °C to accumulate proteins in the Golgi. We then analyzed the exit rate of YFP-VSVG in these cells after switching to 32 °C. We found that the transport of YFP-VSVG was similarly increased in normal fibroblasts when cholesterol efflux was induced by apoAI (Fig. 3 c). Tangier fibroblasts did not show any changes in vesicular transport rate upon apoAI treatment. It is thus apparent that overall vesicular transport from the Golgi to the plasma membrane is up-regulated during apoAI-mediated cholesterol efflux. Both raft-rich and raft-poor populations of secretory vesicles from the Golgi are likely involved in this process. We therefore conclude that vesicular transport from the Golgi to the plasma membrane may participate in transporting lipids, including cholesterol, to apoAI on the cell surface. Functional ABCA1 is required for this up-regulation of vesicular transport in response to apoAI. In the present study, we demonstrated that vesicular transport is responsive to apoAI-mediated cholesterol efflux. In particular, Golgi to plasma membrane transport is increased during this cholesterol export process. A functional ABCA1 or active cholesterol efflux is required for this enhancement as Tangier cells fail to show any alterations in vesicular transport. This conclusion was not only supported by two independent vesicular markers, YFP-GPI and YFP-VSVG, but also by both quantitative fluorescent imaging analysis and biochemical assays. Interestingly, both raft-rich (YFP-GPI) and raft-poor (YFP-VSVG) vesicle populations budding from the Golgi are similarly accelerated by apoAI-mediated cholesterol efflux, indicating a general accelerated membrane trafficking to the plasma membrane. As lipids are the most abundant component of these transporting vesicles, increased vesicular transport means that more lipids including cholesterol are delivered to the plasma membrane during apoAI-mediated cholesterol efflux. Our results thus suggest that vesicular transport from the Golgi to the plasma membrane is one of the means for cells to move stored cholesterol to the cell surface where it can be transferred to the cholesterol acceptor, apoAI. It is unlikely, however, that this vesicular transport is the sole pathway responsible for cholesterol export, since BFA only partially inhibited cholesterol efflux. This suggests that other pathways must be working in parallel to supply lipid including cholesterol to the plasma membrane during efflux. Cholesterol, for instance, can traffic through the cytoplasm to different cellular locations via carrier proteins such as sterol-carrier protein 2 (SCP2) (11Stolowich N.J. Petrescu A.D. Huang H. Martin G.G. Scott A.I. Schroeder F. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 193-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) or caveolin (12Ito J. Nagayasu Y. Kato K. Sato R. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7929-7935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This would provide a non-vesicular transport pathway to translocate intracellular stored cholesterol to the cell surface. This scenario is consistent with what is known for newly synthesized cholesterol transport (13Heino S. Lusa S. Somerharju P. Ehnholm C. Olkkonen V.M. Ikonen E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8375-8380Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The relative contribution from different transport components, such as non-vesicular verses vesicular, may vary to facilitate the cholesterol flow during apoAI-mediated cholesterol efflux at a time when cells are transporting more cholesterol to the cell surface. It is interesting that ABCA1 has a direct impact on the up-regulation of Golgi to plasma membrane trafficking during apoAI-mediated cholesterol efflux. Non-functional mutations in ABCA1 as in Tangier fibroblasts not only abolish cholesterol efflux, but also diminish apoAI-induced enhancement in vesicular transport from the Golgi to the plasma membrane. It is not clear how ABCA1 up-regulates vesicular transport from the Golgi. It is likely, however, that apoAI acquires lipids, including cholesterol, from the cell surface and this action depends on a functional ABCA1. Lipid depletion on the cell surface may initiate intracellular processes that signal cells to increase the delivery machinery required to supply more lipids including cholesterol to the plasma membrane. Vesicular transport from the Golgi is one of components of this process. Without effective cholesterol depletion on the cell surface as in Tangier cells, there may be no need to up-regulate the transport system. Alternatively, ABCA1 may directly influence membrane vesiculation process at the Golgi, especially when cells are under stimulated conditions, such as apoAI-mediated efflux. This would imply that apoAI might be able to initiate a signal transduction process from the cell surface to regulate ABCA1 function in the Golgi. ABCA1 has been identified as a phosphatidylserine flippase (14Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciani M.F. Toti F. Chaslin S. Freyssinet J.M. Devaux P.F. McNeish J. Marguet D. Chimini G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) and shown to influence vesiculation processes on the plasma membrane (15Zha X. Genest Jr., J. McPherson R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39476-39483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 16Robenek H. Schmitz G. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 1007-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Golgi membrane, especially the membrane in trans-Golgi network, is thought to share many characteristics, such as lipid content, with the plasma membrane. Thus, it would not be entirely surprising if ABCA1 actually functions in the Golgi to directly influence vesicular transport to the plasma membrane, even though the mechanism may not be identical as on the plasma membrane. This notion is further supported by the fact that a morphologically abnormal Golgi has been frequently observed in Tangier cells (15Zha X. Genest Jr., J. McPherson R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39476-39483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In summary, we have identified the involvement of the Golgi in ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux. We demonstrate for the first time that membrane trafficking from the Golgi is regulated under physiological conditions, such as apoAI-mediated efflux. As enhanced Golgi to plasma membrane trafficking likely represents only part of a complex intracellular process, it will be now important to investigate other cellular transport events that may interplay with the Golgi to facilitate cholesterol transport to the cell surface during efflux.

https://openalex.org/W2142517063,"Our results presented here suggest that cortical neurons degenerate via two caspase-mediated apoptotic pathways when challenged with 0.5 microM rotenone. Although these two pathways can be attributed to the loss of mitochondrial integrity, the triggers for these pathways are likely due to two separate subsequent events (the release of cytochrome c and the emergence of mitochondrial permeability transition [MPT]). Despite some reports suggesting that the release of cytochrome c is a consequence of MPT, the results of our time course experiments suggest otherwise. In fact, we observed that the release of cytochrome c occurred much earlier than MPT; hence, the former is unlikely to be a consequence of the latter. In addition, we observed that the presence of an MPT inhibitor did not attenuate the activation of caspase-3, and that caspase-1-mediated cell death did not exhibit nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation. Taken together, these results suggest that there are two routes by which cortical neurons degenerate during ischemic injury or in neurodegenerative diseases."

This phenomenon reveals significant sequence elements in small multidrug transporters. tetraphenylphosphonium isopropyl-1-thio-ॆ-d-galactopyranoside carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone n-dodecyl-ॆ-maltoside nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Multidrug transporters actively remove toxic compounds from the cytoplasm of cells. They are widespread from bacteria to man and have been associated with multidrug resistance (1Nikaido H. Science. 1994; 264: 382-388Google Scholar, 2Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Ambudkar S.V. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 610-617Google Scholar). Many multidrug transporters have been identified to date and classified into several protein families (3Marger M. Saier M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 13-20Google Scholar, 4Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Microbiol Rev. 1996; 60: 575-608Google Scholar). Proteins in the Smr family of small multidrug resistance proteins are ∼110-amino acids long and extrude various drugs in exchange with protons, thereby rendering bacteria resistant to these compounds (5Schuldiner S. Granot D. Mordoch S.S. Ninio S. Rotem D. Soskin M. Tate C.G. Yerushalmi H. News Physiol. Sci. 2001; 16: 130-134Google Scholar, 6Schuldiner S. Granot D. Steiner S. Ninio S. Rotem D. Soskin M. Yerushalmi H. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 155-162Google Scholar). Several Smr proteins have been characterized, purified, and reconstituted in a functional form (7Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6856-6863Google Scholar, 8Ninio S. Rotem D. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48250-48256Google Scholar). Most posses a single membrane-embedded charged residue, Glu-14, conserved in more than sixty homologous proteins (8Ninio S. Rotem D. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48250-48256Google Scholar), which was shown to be part of a binding site common to protons and substrates (9Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 93-97Google Scholar, 10Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14711-14719Google Scholar). The basic oligomeric structure detected in two-dimensional crystals of EmrE, an E. coli Smr, is a dimer (11Tate C.G. Kunji E.R. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 77-81Google Scholar). Radiolabeled substrate binding to purified EmrE and negative dominance experiments support the contention that the functional unit of the protein is an oligomer formed by two dimers (12Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Google Scholar, 13Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31044-31048Google Scholar, 14Rotem D. Sal-Man N. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48243-48249Google Scholar). In the absence of high-resolution structure, it would be useful to study the effect of multiple changes on the function of the protein. This is a complicated task to perform using site-directed mutagenesis, because designing an effective combination of mutations is not straightforward. One way to tackle this problem is by analyzing a set of homologues that provide natural, more complex, and less biased mutants (8Ninio S. Rotem D. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48250-48256Google Scholar). However, also with these mutants it is not always possible to identify suppressor or complimentary substitutions throughout the protein. Here we describe a special case that demonstrates an approach to overcome this problem. We report the first identification and characterization of an Smr protein from Archaea, the third domain of the universal phylogenetic tree (15Pace N.R. Science. 1997; 276: 734-740Google Scholar). This protein, named Hsmr, was cloned from the archaeon H. salinarumbased on sequence similarity to the Smr family. Hsmr was heterologously expressed in E. coli cells in a functional form despite the difference in lipid composition of the membrane and the lower salt in the cell and its environment. Hsmr renders cells resistant to the effect of multiple drugs and catalyzes the active efflux of ethidium from the cells. Detergent-solubilized Hsmr binds the high affinity substrate tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+)1 in a salt-dependent manner: at low salt with aKD of 200 nm, and 40 nm at high salt. The Hsmr protein contains many of the signature sequence elements defining the Smr family. However, it also has a highly unusual sequence displaying some unique characteristics. It is composed of over 407 valine and alanine residues, which are distributed throughout the protein, often concentrated at areas where there is no sequence conservation. We suggest that this phenomenon is the outcome of a natural process of alanine and valine 舠scanning舡 that is necessitated by the high GC content of the gene. E. coli JM109 (16Yanish-Perron C. Viera J. Messing J. Gene. 1985; 33: 103-199Google Scholar) and E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI) were used throughout this work. The plasmids used are pT7–7 (17Tabor S. Richardson C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Google Scholar), pT7–7 EmrE-His (12Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Google Scholar), and pT7–7 Hsmr-His. The latter was constructed as follows: the hsmr gene (OE3652F in the H. salinarum data base www.halolex.mpg.de) was cloned by polymerase chain reaction using as template genomic DNA from H. salinarum (provided by Prof. M. Mevarech, Faculty of Life Sciences, Tel Aviv University, Israel). Primers were designed to overlap with each end of the gene and included sites for restriction enzymes NdeI and EcoRI. The gene was cloned into the pT7–7-His vector, which was obtained by removing theemrE gene from vector pT7–7-EmrE-His with restriction enzymes NdeI and EcoRI. The start codon was modified from GTG to ATG. Resistance to toxic compounds was tested after overnight growth in 2xYT liquid media consisting of 1.67 (w/v) tryptone, 17 (w/v) yeast extract, and 0.57 (w/v) NaCl. Efflux of ethidium in whole cells was assayed essentially as described (7Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6856-6863Google Scholar), except thatE. coli BL21(DE3) cells were used. The cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium, when the culture reachedA600 ∼0.4, isopropyl-1-thio-ॆ-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to 0.5 mm. Two hours later the cells were centrifuged and resuspended in minimal medium A supplemented with 0.057 NaCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 0.367 glucose. At this point, ethidium and carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) were added to a final concentration of 1 ॖg/ml and 40 ॖm, respectively, and the cells were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. The cells were collected by centrifugation and quickly resuspended in medium containing the same ethidium concentration without CCCP, and fluorescence was measured in a PerkinElmer fluorimeter (Luminescence Spectrometer LS-5) with exciting light at 545 nm and emission at 610 nm. E. coliBL21(DE3) cells bearing plasmid pT7–7 Hsmr-His were grown at 37 °C in 2xYT medium. When the culture reached A600∼0.8, IPTG was added to 0.5 mm. Two hours later the cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 2.5 mm MgSO4, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and resuspended in the same buffer containing 15 ॖg/ml DNaseI (5 ml buffer/g cells). Membranes were prepared by disrupting the cells using a Microfluidics microfluidizer processor (M-110EHi). Non-disrupted cells were separated by centrifugation, and the membranes were collected by ultracentrifugation at 300,000 × g for 60 min. The membrane pellet was resuspended in the same buffer, frozen in liquid air, and stored at −70 °C. Hsmr-His was purified by solubilizing membranes (0.25 mg of total protein) in SDS-Urea buffer (27 SDS, 6 murea, 15 mm Tris, pH 7.5) for 15 min at 25 °C. Solubilized material was added to equilibrated Ni-NTA beads (Qiagene, GmbH, Hilden, Germany), and incubated for one hour at room temperature in the presence of 25 mm imidazole. Unbound material was discarded, the beads were washed once in the same buffer, and the protein was eluted in 200 mm imidazole. A sample was analyzed on SDS-PAGE. TPP+ binding was assayed essentially as described previously (12Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Google Scholar). Membranes were solubilized with 17 n-dodecyl-ॆ-maltoside (DDM), (Anatrace, Inc., Maumee, Ohio) in Na-buffer (150 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5) and immobilized on Ni-NTA beads. After two washes with Na buffer supplemented with 0.087 DDM, 200 ॖl of buffer containing 10 nm[3H]TPP+ (27 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) were added and the samples were incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. In each experiment, the values obtained in a control reaction, with 100 ॖm unlabeled TPP+, were subtracted. All binding reactions were performed in duplicate. The Hsmr protein (Fig. 1A) was identified based on sequence similarity to EmrE, an E. coli protein belonging to the Smr family of multidrug resistance proteins. The gene encoding for Hsmr is very rich in GC (687 GC), whereas the percentage of coding GC in the H. salinarum genome is slightly lower (657). At the amino acid level Hsmr shares 547 similarity and 437 identity with the EmrE protein. Hsmr is of particular interest because it is the first Smr protein found in the Archaea kingdom. A simple comparison of the amino acid composition of Hsmr and EmrE reveals some striking differences, which are summarized in Fig. 1B. The number of charged residues greatly differs between the two proteins. Both proteins have a glutamate at position 14, the only charged residue in the trans-membrane domain. This glutamate residue is conserved throughout the Smr family (3Marger M. Saier M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 13-20Google Scholar, 8Ninio S. Rotem D. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48250-48256Google Scholar) and was shown to have a central role in the transport mechanism of EmrE (12Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Google Scholar, 18Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5264-5269Google Scholar). However, although EmrE has only two additional negatively charged residues, Hsmr has seven. They are located in putative hydrophilic loops of the protein, four of them in pairs, a pattern found in other proteins of halophilic organisms (Fig. 1, A and B). The overall number of charged residues in Hsmr is eleven, eight of which are negative, two histidines and one highly conserved lysine at position 22. A high content of negatively charged amino acids has been reported before in other halophilic proteins, and is suggested to have a stabilizing effect at high salt concentrations (19Mevarech M. Frolow F. Gloss L.M. Biophys. Chem. 2000; 86: 155-164Google Scholar). The proportion of hydrophobic residues is similar in the two proteins; however, the composition is very different. Hsmr contains more alanine and valine residues, 19 and 26 compared with 9 and 5 in EmrE, respectively. Thus, Hsmr displays a remarkable amino acid composition of over 407 valine and alanine residues. In parallel, the amount of isoleucine residues also changes from 15 in EmrE to only 3 in Hsmr. A small difference is observed in the number of glycines (11 in Hsmr, 12 in EmrE), leucines (12 and 16, respectively) and phenylalanines (4 and 5, respectively) (not shown). Hsmr contains no cysteine residues and a single tryptophan at position 63, a fully conserved residue. Stevens and Arkin (20Stevens T.J. Arkin I.T. Protein. Sci. 2000; 9: 505-511Google Scholar) found a strong correlation between the GC content of a genome, and the ratio of (Val+Ala)/(Ile+Phe) residues of its membrane proteins. The higher the GC content of a genome, the higher the amount of valine and alanine residues. This correlation is explained by a codon bias toward GC-rich codons, together with a need to retain a certain level of hydrophobicity in a membrane-spanning region. Inhsmr the codons used for alanine and valine are, exclusively, the ones with the highest GC content: GTG and GTC for valine, and GCG and GCC for alanine. The distribution of valine and alanine residues within the trans-membrane helices of Hsmr is not random. Many of these abundant residues appear to be clustered in structural domains, as can be seen in the helical-wheel projection of the trans-membrane helices of Hsmr (Fig.2). Particularly stunning is the situation in helices 1 and 4. Residues that are highly conserved throughout the Smr family (8Ninio S. Rotem D. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48250-48256Google Scholar) are located on the opposite face of the helix from where the valine and alanine residues are clustered (Fig. 2,arrows). A similar distribution is observed in additional Smr proteins from other GC-rich organisms (not shown). This dramatic phenomenon may reflect the outcome of an evolutionary process leading to the replacement of all residues not essential for function with either valine or alanine. In a sense this resembles the result of an alanine scan mutagenesis experiment, pointing out instantaneously the residues that are important for the function of the protein, and therefore cannot be replaced with valine or alanine. Such a high alanine and valine content could be very useful in identifying domains important for function in Smr proteins. Therefore, we tested whether Hsmr can be functionally expressed. E. coli JM109 cells carrying the plasmids pT7–7 Hsmr, pT7–7 EmrE-His, or pT7–7 (vector alone) were tested for resistance to ethidium bromide, acriflavine, and methyl viologen. Cells expressing Hsmr grow in the presence of ethidium bromide up to 500 ॖm, to the same extent as cells expressing EmrE, whereas cells with vector alone display an IC50 of ∼130 ॖm (Fig.3A). In acriflavine, however, Hsmr cells display an intermediate resistance, with an IC50of ∼70 ॖm, whereas vector alone cells have an IC50 of around 20 ॖm, and EmrE-His cells are only inhibited by 257 at 120 ॖm acriflavine (Fig.3B). Hsmr cells are not resistant to methyl viologen and display an IC50 of 75 ॖm, similar to that of vector alone cells, whereas EmrE-His cells can grow in the presence of up to 200 ॖm methyl viologen (Fig. 3C). Hsmr, therefore, functions as a multidrug resistance protein but displays a different substrate-specificity relative to that of EmrE. We further explored Hsmr function by directly testing its ability to catalyze the transport of ethidium bromide in whole cells. Entry of ethidium into cells is manifested by an increase in the fluorescence due to binding to nucleic acids (7Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6856-6863Google Scholar, 21Lambert B. Le Pecq J.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 166-176Google Scholar). Cells overexpressing either Hsmr or mock vector were treated with the uncoupler CCCP to facilitate the entry of ethidium into the cells, as previously described (7Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6856-6863Google Scholar). After 60 min of incubation with ethidium (1 ॖg/ml) and CCCP (40 ॖm) the cells were collected by centrifugation and rapidly resuspended in medium containing the same concentration of ethidium, but without uncoupler. Upon removal of the uncoupler from Hsmr overexpressing cells, a rapid decrease in fluorescence is observed, even before the tracing begins, and is completed in less than 7 min (Fig.3D, left). This decrease in fluorescence, which represents removal of ethidium from the cells against a concentration gradient, is completely reversed upon addition of CCCP (Fig.3D, left). As expected, in cells harboring a control vector no decrease in fluorescence was observed (Fig.3D, right). These results demonstrate that Hsmr catalyzes the active removal of ethidium in whole cells. Expression levels were tested in membranes prepared from IPTG induced E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells harboring the plasmid pT7–7 Hsmr-His. The His-tagged Hsmr protein was purified from the membranes using a Ni-NTA column. The purified protein was analyzed on SDS-PAGE, alongside purified samples of EmrE (Fig.4A). Hsmr reaches high levels of expression in E. coli membranes, up to 2 mg per 1 liter culture. As seen in Fig. 4A, the EmrE monomer displays an apparent Mr of 14,000. This value is close to the theoretical value of molecular mass calculated for a protein the size of EmrE or Hsmr (not shown). Surprisingly, Hsmr displays an apparent Mr of 30,000, suggesting that the dimeric complex of Hsmr does not dissociate, even in the presence of SDS. Furthermore, a small amount of protein corresponding to the Hsmr tetramer can also be observed (Fig. 4A). The protein was challenged with an anti-His antibody and also specifically radiolabeled, and in both cases it co-migrated with the Coomassie-stained protein (not shown). Attempts to dissociate the dimer were made by modifying the treatment of the sample before loading on the gel. These treatments included solubilization in various detergents and boiling of the purified protein; however, they yielded no visible monomers on the gel. Monomers were observed only after extraction of diluted protein in a mixture of chloroform and methanol (not shown). A very convenient functional assay of detergent-solubilized EmrE has been previously developed (12Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Google Scholar). Here we show that DDM-solubilized Hsmr also specifically binds [3H]TPP+ in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4B) in the range up to 50 ॖg of protein, leveling off at the high protein amounts, because of substrate depletion. To test interaction with other known substrates of EmrE, the compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit the binding reaction. The results are shown in Fig.5. Methyl viologen had no effect on [3H]TPP+ binding to Hsmr, as expected from the inability of Hsmr to confer resistance against this compound in living cells (see Fig. 3C). Benzalkonium, ethidium, and acriflavine inhibit [3H]TPP+ binding to Hsmr in the ॖm range (Fig. 5), suggesting that they specifically interact with Hsmr. These results are in accordance with the phenotype presented in Fig. 3, and together they demonstrate the function of Hsmr as a multidrug protein, which can interact in a specific manner with different drugs. H. salinarum, from which the Hsmr protein originates, normally resides in extreme environments where the salt concentration reaches very high values of 4–5 m (22Madern D. Ebel C. Zaccai G. Extremophiles. 2000; 4: 91-98Google Scholar). It was therefore interesting to examine the effect of salt on the activity of Hsmr. For that purpose solubilized membranes from cells expressing either Hsmr or EmrE were assayed for [3H]TPP+ binding at increasing concentrations of NaCl, KCl, or LiCl. Hsmr-binding activity is markedly stimulated in the presence of KCl, NaCl, and LiCl (Fig.6A). As the concentration of salt rises from zero to 3.2 m an increase in the binding activity is observed, saturating around the high salt concentration. Both KCl and NaCl brought about a 6–7-fold increase in the binding upon addition of about 3.0 m salt. A smaller effect is seen in LiCl that induces only a 4-fold increase at similar concentrations. The binding activity of EmrE is not affected by the salt concentration and remains constant up to 3 m KCl, NaCl, or LiCl (Fig.6B). To understand the mechanism underlying this salt effect we measured the binding affinity at the different salt concentrations. We found that the binding affinity increases 5-fold, from 200 to 40 nm, upon the addition of 2 m NaCl. The first Smr protein from the archaeon H. salinarumwas identified based on sequence similarity. Its unusual alanine and valine content, and the clustering of these residues in certain domains, suggested possible functional implications. Therefore, we set out to probe the activity of the protein. Hsmr was functionally expressed in E. coli membranes, to high levels. Proteins from extremely halophilic bacteria are adapted to a very high salt environment (above 3 m), and usually denature in the absence of high salt, resulting in a non-functional protein (22Madern D. Ebel C. Zaccai G. Extremophiles. 2000; 4: 91-98Google Scholar). Nonetheless, expression of the hsmr gene in E. coli results in the production of a protein that is functionalin vivo as judged from drug resistance phenotype and from a whole cell ethidium efflux assay. Hsmr is active in a wide range of conditions because it does not strictly require salt for its activity. It is also able to function in the E. coli membrane, which has a lipid composition very different from the archaeal membrane it originated from (23Albers S.V. van de Vossenberg J.L. Driessen A.J. Konings W.N. Extremophiles. 2001; 5: 285-294Google Scholar, 24van de Vossenberg J.L. Driessen A.J. Konings W.N. Extremophiles. 1998; 2: 163-170Google Scholar). The stability of the protein is also apparent when analyzed on SDS-PAGE. The Hsmr dimer stays intact even at high concentrations of SDS. This unusual phenomenon of an SDS-stable oligomer has been reported before with the dimer of glycophorine A (25Furthmayr H. Marchesi V.T. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1137-1144Google Scholar) as well as for the phospholamban pentamer (26Watanabe Y. Kijima Y. Kadoma M. Tada M. Takagi T. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 40-45Google Scholar). Attempts to dissociate the Hsmr dimer have been made by using different solubilization conditions and by heating the protein sample before loading on the gel. The protein retained its 舠dimeric舡 mobility on the gel unless diluted and extracted in an organic solvent. Hsmr is also functionalin vitro, in its DDM-solubilized form, where it specifically binds the substrate TPP+ in a dose-dependent manner. Although the protein retains its binding activity even in the absence of salt, this activity is greatly enhanced at high salt concentrations as a result of an increase in the affinity of the protein to TPP+. This salt effect appears to be a general one because it is observed in both NaCl and KCl as well as in LiCl and MgCl2 (not shown) to a lesser extent. The Smr proteins are not as ubiquitous in the Archaea as in the Eubacteria. Only three other homologues can be identified until now, all of them in various Methanosarcinoma species (not shown). Hsmr was identified based on sequence similarity to the Smr family, yet was found to have a unique sequence composition. Compared with other Smr proteins, Hsmr contains many negative charges, located mostly at the hydrophilic loops of the protein. This phenomenon is observed in many halophilic proteins and is said to contribute much to their stability in high salt (27Elcock A.H. McCammon J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 731-748Google Scholar). Hsmr has only one positive charge, Lys-22, which is fully conserved in the Smr family, and two histidine residues facing the opposite side of the membrane. Because there are so few positive charges, which are distributed quite symmetrically on both sides of the membrane, it is difficult to apply the von Heijne rule for topology prediction (28von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3021-3027Google Scholar) to this protein. The inapplicability of this rule with Smr proteins has been demonstrated before and was suggested to result from their small size (18Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5264-5269Google Scholar). The most striking feature of Hsmr is the fact that it is built of over 407 valine and alanine residues, clustered at certain regions of the protein. This clustering is in domains that do not seem important for activity. According to Stevens and Arkin (20Stevens T.J. Arkin I.T. Protein. Sci. 2000; 9: 505-511Google Scholar), and discussed earlier, there exists a strong positive correlation between the GC content of a genome and the amount of valine and alanine residues found in membrane proteins it codes for. This correlation is explained by a codon bias toward amino acids coded predominately by GC nucleotides, together with a need to retain certain physical properties within a trans-membrane domain. The rise in the abundance of valine residues is also thought to be compensating for the lack of AT-coded amino acids, particularly isoleucine, with which it shares similar physical properties. The alanine and valine codons are GCN and GTN, respectively, of which only GCG and GCC (for alanine) and GTG and GTC (for valine) are present in the hsmr gene. Although codon bias could be fulfilled also by glycine and leucine, the frequency of these amino acids does not increase in proteins from organisms with high GC content (20Stevens T.J. Arkin I.T. Protein. Sci. 2000; 9: 505-511Google Scholar). We speculate that glycine would not be hydrophobic enough and could allow too much flexibility of the helix; leucine may be bulkier than necessary. The distribution of valine and alanine residues in the first trans-membrane domain of Hsmr correlates well with information deduced from extensive site-directed mutagenesis of the same trans-membrane domain in the homologous protein EmrE. EmrE mutations in residues in the same face of the helix as Glu-14 have effects on the catalytic activity of the protein, whereas mutations on the other face of the helix have no effect (31Gutman N. Steiner-Mordoch S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; (February 16, 10.1074/jbc.M213120200)Google Scholar). Strikingly, the face tolerant to mutations is the one predominated by alanine residues in Hsmr. Without a high-resolution structure of an Smr we can only speculate about the location of an alanine-rich face in a membrane protein. Alanine is a small, relatively hydrophobic amino acid. Because of its size it could provide an interface for tight packing of two helices (30Jiang S. Vakser I.A. Proteins. 2000; 40: 429-435Google Scholar). On the other hand, its hydrophobicity is high enough for interaction with lipids in the membrane. Hsmr is therefore a case of natural alanine and valine mutagenesis. Multiple sites in the protein, located in regions not important for activity, have become through evolution occupied by valine or alanine residues. The advantage of analyzing sequences such as that of Hsmr is that the outcome of replacements in more than one position can be seen within the same protein. Multiple replacements are more informative than single ones. The latter depend at times on the properties of amino acids in positions other than the ones modified. This could be because of size, charge, or other properties. Multiple replacements are difficult to design, therefore the analysis of valine- and alanine-rich sequences could greatly facilitate their planning or even serve as ready made 舠mutants,舡 a quick alternative for experimentation. We found that the valine and alanine clustering is observed in additional membrane proteins from H. salinarum, and therefore may be part of a general phenomenon. A full genomic and statistical analysis is required to conclude whether this phenomenon can be used to reveal significant sequence elements in membrane proteins in general. If this is indeed a general phenomenon it could be used to devise an algorithm predicting important regions within a Val+Ala-rich membrane protein sequence, without the need for additional information. This prediction, in turn, could be projected on to non-Val+Ala-rich homologues, providing a general tool for a quick preliminary prediction of significant regions within a given membrane protein."
https://openalex.org/W2071490152,"Integrin complexes are necessary for proper proliferation and differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes. Differentiation of these cells is accompanied by down-regulation of integrins and focal adhesions as well as formation of intercellular adherens junctions through E-cadherin homodimerization. A central component of integrin adhesion complexes is integrin-linked kinase (ILK), which can induce loss of E-cadherin expression and epithelial-mesenchymal transformation when ectopically expressed in intestinal and mammary epithelia. In cultured primary mouse keratinocytes, we find that ILK protein levels are independent of integrin expression and signaling, since they remain constant during Ca(2+)-induced differentiation. In contrast, keratinocyte differentiation is accompanied by marked reduction in kinase activity in ILK immunoprecipitates and altered ILK subcellular distribution. Specifically, ILK distributes in close apposition to actin fibers along intercellular junctions in differentiated but not in undifferentiated keratinocytes. ILK localization to cell-cell borders occurs independently of integrin signaling and requires Ca(2+) as well as an intact actin cytoskeleton. Further, and in contrast to what is observed in other epithelial cells, ILK overexpression in differentiated keratinocytes does not promote E-cadherin down-regulation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Thus, novel tissue-specific mechanisms control the formation of ILK complexes associated with cell-cell junctions in differentiating murine epidermal keratinocytes."

Through two-dimensional1H NMR experiments, the overall three-dimensional structure of a constrained synthetic peptide mimicking the eLP2 had been determined by our group (Ruan, K.-H., So, S.-P., Wu, J., Li, D., Huang, A., and Kung, J. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 275–280). To further identify the residues involved in ligand binding, a TP receptor antagonist, SQ29,548 was used to interact with the synthetic peptide. High resolution two-dimensional 1H NMR experiments, NOESY, and TOCSY were performed for the peptide, SQ29,548, and peptide with SQ29,548, respectively. Through completed 1H NMR assignment and by comparing the different spectra, extra peaks were observed on the NOESY spectrum of the peptide with SQ29,548, which implied the contacts between residues of eLP2 at Val176, Leu185, Thr186, and Leu187 with SQ29,548 at position H2, H7, and H8. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to confirm the possible ligand-binding sites on native human TP receptor. Each of the four residues was mutated to the residues either in the same group, with different structure or different charged. The mutated receptors were then tested for their ligand binding activity. The receptor with V176L mutant retained binding activity to SQ29,548. All other mutations resulted in decreased or lost binding activity to SQ29,548. These mutagenesis results supported the prediction from NMR experiments in which Val176, Leu185, Thr186, and Leu187 are the possible residues involved in ligand binding. This information facilitates the understanding of the molecular mechanism of thromboxane A2 binding to the important receptor and its signal transduction.

The function of TXA2 is mediated by specific cell surface receptor, thromboxane A2 receptor (TP) (3Coleman R.A. Kennedy I. Humphrey P.P.A. Bunce K. Kumley P. Hansch C. Sammes P.J. Taylor J.B.

The understanding of the structure and function of TP receptor can greatly explain how the ligand binds to its receptor and initiates the following cell signaling. TP receptor was first purified from platelet in 1989, and the cDNA of TP receptor was cloned from placenta in (4Ushikubi F. Nakajima M. Hirata M. Okuma M. Fujiwara M. Narumiya S. J. Biol.

Other human prostanoid receptor cDNAs have also been cloned by homology screening. All of the prostanoid receptors belong to the G-protein-coupled receptor family that share a basic seven transmembrane segments and couple to different signal transduction systems to play diverse physiological and pathological roles (6Katsuyama M.

There were two TP receptor isoforms with different C-terminal tails, resulting from alternative splicing that the last 15 amino acids of the C terminus were replaced by 79 amino acids (15Raychowdhury M.K.

Based on the sequence alignment, the second extracellular loop (eLP2) and the third and seventh transmembrane domains of the prostanoid receptors are highly conserved and are proposed to be involved in ligand binding (18Negishi M. Sugimoto Y. Ichikawa A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 109-120Google Scholar). Residues 198–205 in the eLP2 of the EP3 receptor have been reported as an essential determinant of ligand selectivity (19Audoly L. Breyer R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13475-13478Google Scholar). These results suggest that the extracellular domains of other prostanoid receptors are involved in the initial specific ligand interaction. The residues responsible for specific ligand recognition within eLP2 of the TP receptor have not been thoroughly examined. The mutations based on alignment only are controversial and will need structural information to support. The structures of the transmembrane domains of prostanoid receptors may be similar, but the specific recognition sites on extracellular domains will be different because the ligand structures are different. Thus, structural characterization of the extracellular functional domains of prostanoid receptors could help in understanding the specificities of ligand binding. In our current study, the structure of the highly conserved eLP2 has been characterized by high resolution NMR using a synthetic eLP2 peptide with constrained loop ends (1Ruan K.-H. So S.-P. Wu J. Li D. Huang A. Kung J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 275-280Google Scholar). To identify which residues make up the ligand recognition site of the receptor, SQ29,548 was added to the peptide to determine the interaction using high resolution two-dimensional 1H NMR technique. The residues identified from the NMR approach for the interaction between the ligand and the eLP2 were further confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. Results from the studies provided an approach of using NMR experiments guided site-directed mutagenesis for identification of the important residues of other prostanoid receptors and other G-protein-coupled receptors, which is more reasonable and close to the fact than those mutations performed only based on alignment. Ethanol-d 6 and D2O were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. (Andover, MA). SQ29,548 was from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). The QIAprep spin miniprep kit was from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). COS-7 cell was purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Medium for culturing COS-7 cells was from Invitrogen. [3H]SQ29,548 was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. A constrained loop peptide mimicking the sequence of the second extracellular loop of TP receptor (residues 173–193) with homocysteine added at both ends (Fig. 1) was synthesized for NMR study using fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-polyamide solid phase method and cyclized by the formation of disulfide bound as described previously (1Ruan K.-H. So S.-P. Wu J. Li D. Huang A. Kung J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 275-280Google Scholar, 20Merrifield R.B. J. Am. Chem. Sci. 1963; 85: 2149-2154Google Scholar, 21Merrifield R.B. Vizioli L.D. Boman H.G.

For the cyclization, the peptide was dissolved in 1 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and added to H2O at a final concentration of 0.02 mg/ml with pH 8.5 adjusted by triethylamine, and stirred overnight at room temperature. The cyclic peptide was then lyophilized and purified by HPLC on the C4 column. The HPLC-purified constrained loop peptide was dissolved in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, at a final concentration of 5 mm. 1 mg of SQ29,548 was dissolved in 50 μl of ethanol-d 6 and then added to 0.45 ml of sodium phosphate buffer (20 mm) containing 10% D2O (1Ruan K.-H. So S.-P. Wu J. Li D. Huang A. Kung J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 275-280Google Scholar). Any insoluble ligand was removed by centrifugalization. The concentration for the mixture of peptide and SQ29,548 was the same as above. Proton NMR experiments were carried out on a VARIAN Unity Plus 500 spectrometer, which was equipped with Z-pulsed field gradient. Two-dimensional NMR experiments (DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY) were performed for eLP2 only (1Ruan K.-H. So S.-P. Wu J. Li D. Huang A. Kung J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 275-280Google Scholar), SQ29,548 only, and their mixture at 298 K. The WATERGATE method was used to suppress the signal of water. NOESY spectra were recorded with mixing time of 200 ms. TOCSY spectra was carried out with decoupling in the presence of scalar interactions spin-lock sequence with a total mixing time of 50 ms. 512 t1 increments were used in F1 with 32 scans per t1 increment and composed of 2048 complex points in F2 in all experiments. Quadrature detection was achieved in F1 by the states-time proportional phase increment method. The NMR data were processed using Felix program. All free induction decays were zero-filled to 2048 × 2048 before Fourier transformation, and 0° (for DQF-COSY), 70° (for TOCSY), or 90° (for NOESY) shifted sinbell2 window function was used in both dimensions. PCR cloning was used to isolate the full-length cDNA of the TP receptor from human lung cDNA obtained from Invitrogen. The PCR primers were designed based on human TP cDNA with some modifications (5Hirata M. Hayashi Y. Ushikubi F. Yokata Y. Kageyama R. Nakanishi S. Narumiya S. Nature. 1991; 349: 617-620Google Scholar, 23Funk C.D. Furci L. Moran N. Fitzgerald G.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 934-939Google Scholar). The primer sequences were: 5′-CGGAATTCATGTGGCCCAACGGCAGTTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAAGATCTCGCTCTGTCCACTTCCTACTG-3′ (reverse), withEcoRI and BglII sites on the ends. The full-length cDNA of the TP receptor was obtained from standard PCR amplification that was performed in 50 μl of reaction mixture containing 1 unit of Vent polymerase and buffer (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), a 0.4 μm concentration of each primer, 2 μl of human lung cDNA for 30 cycles of 98 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. The amplified products were isolated from agarose gel and subcloned into theEcoRI/BglII sites of pAcSG. Correct cDNA sequence of the receptor was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestions and DNA sequencing analysis using Sanger dideoxy chain termination method (24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar). pAcSG-TP wild-type cDNA was first subcloned into EcoRI/XbaI sites of pcDNA3.1(+) expression vector. The TP receptor mutants were then constructed using standard PCR. The procedure utilized pcDNA3.1(+) vector with wild-type TP receptor as template and two synthetic oligonucleotide primers containing the desired mutation for the reaction. The primers, which were complementary to opposite strands of the template, extended during the temperature cycling of 95 °C for 30 s, 53 °C for 1 min 30 s, and 68 °C for 13 min for a total of 25 cycles with an additional extension cycle of 68 °C for 10 min using Pfu DNA polymerase from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The mutant products were treated with DpnI endonuclease (Stratagene) to digest the parental DNA template and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmids were then prepared using Midiprep kit (Qiagen) for the transfection into COS-7 cells for expression. COS-7 cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, and antimycotics. The cells placed on 100-mm dishes at a density of 1.0 × 106 were cultured overnight and then transfected with 10 μg of purified cDNA of pcDNA3.1(+)/TP wild-type or mutants by DEAE-dextran method. Approximately 48 h after transfection, the cells were harvested in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline buffer and collected by centrifuge for further protein determination. Ligand binding assay for TP receptor was performed using the method as described by Tai's group (25Chiang N. Kan W.M. Tai H.-H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 9-17Google Scholar). The cell pellets of 800 μg in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm CaCl2 were incubated with 3 nm [3H]SQ29,548 (30,000 cpm, 30 Ci/mol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the presence or absence of 5 μm of unlabeled (cold) SQ29,548 in the 0.1-ml reaction volume with vigorous shaking at room temperature for 60 min. The reaction was then terminated by adding 1 ml of ice-cold washing buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The unbound ligand was filtered through an ice-cold washing buffer presoaked Whatman GF/C glass filter (Whatman, Clifton, NJ) under vacuum. The radioactivity of the TP receptor-bound [3H]SQ29,548 remained on the glass filter was counted in 4 ml of scintillation mixture using a Beckman β counter (Fullerton, CA). The constrained synthetic eLP2 peptide (Fig.1) mimicking the second extracellular loop of the native human TP receptor, which showed the conformational change upon the interaction with the receptor antagonist SQ29,548 in the circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescent spectroscopic studies (1Ruan K.-H. So S.-P. Wu J. Li D. Huang A. Kung J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 275-280Google Scholar), was used for the two-dimensional 1H NMR experiments. To observe the interaction between the constrained peptide and SQ29,548 at the atomic level, NOESY spectra for the eLP2 peptide, SQ29,548, and the mixture of the peptide with SQ29,548 were recorded separately under the same conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Resonance assignments were made using a standard approach (Table I) (26Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, New York1986Google Scholar). To determine which residues of the constrained TP eLP2 interact with the ligand SQ29,548, the NOESY spectra were used to identify the intermolecular contact between the peptide and SQ29,548 (Fig. 2). The results indicate that Val176, Leu185, Thr186, and Leu187 interacted with SQ29,548 and predict that the residues are involved in the TP receptor initial ligand recognition.Table IComplete resonance assignment for the proton chemical shifts of TPeLP2 peptide and SQ29,548ResiduesProton chemical shifts for TPeLP2 peptide in the presence of SQ29,548HNHαHβOthersHomo-Cys14.291.912.38Arg28.524.321.411.63, 3.04, 7.02Tyr38.303.882.78, 2.966.97Thr48.114.314.081.05Val57.983.961.880.89, 0.71Gln68.154.171.76, 2.07Tyr77.914.232.72, 2.96.93Pro84.002.44, 2.562.14, 2.08Gly97.823.683.61Ser107.994.253.76, 3.67Trp117.924.503.157.46, 9.99, 7.02Cys127.774.262.52, 2.63Phe137.864.442.87, 3.047.11Leu148.064.221.510.75, 1.03Thr157.844.244.111.09Leu167.914.231.470.75Gly178.144.313.79Ala188.044.211.29Glu198.184.251.89, 2.052.34Ser208.064.293.79, 3.77Gly218.374.103.86Asp228.094.392.62, 2.53Homo-Cys238.094.391.952.12Proton chemical shifts for SQ29,548 with and without the presence of TPeLP2 peptideWithout TPeLP2 peptideWith TPeLP2 peptideH22.112.26H31.511.55H41.961.88H55.435.41H65.365.36H71.981.99H81.931.88H94.274.27H10_11.591.59H10_21.401.45H11_11.671.67H11_21.531.53H124.274.27H132.202.20H142.832.83H157.117.11H167.307.30 Open table in a new tab To test whether the residues Val176, Leu185, Thr186, and Leu187identified by the NMR experiments using the constrained eLP2 peptide are involved in the ligand recognition for the native TP receptor, a series of recombinant protein of the human TP receptor with point mutation at the four residues were constructed. These four residues Val176, Leu185, Thr186, and Leu187 were first replaced with glycine to eliminate the side chains of the residues. After transfection of the cDNA of the recombinant TP receptors into COS-7 cells, the similar expression level of the TP receptors were confirmed by Western blot (Fig.3 A). The binding of the recombinant receptors to its ligand was then performed using [3H]SQ29,548, and unlabeled (cold) SQ29,548 was used as a competitive ligand (Fig. 3 B). All of the mutants with glycine replacement showed decreased or lost binding activity to the receptor antagonist, SQ29,548, as compared with the TP wild type (Fig.3 B). These data indicate that the side chains of the residues Val176, Leu185, Leu187, and Thr186 of the native TP receptor are important to the ligand binding via a direct contact in the ligand-binding site or an indirect induced structural effect. These results also support the conclusion based on the NMR experiments in which the four residues of the TP receptor play important roles on the receptor ligand interaction. To further identify what determines the ligand binding, the four residues were then mutated to either the same type residues, residues with different structures, or residues with different charged (Fig.4). Val176 was mutated to residue Asp, Leu, or Arg. Leu185 and Leu187were mutated to residue Ala, Asp, or Arg. Thr186 was mutated to residue Ala, Arg, or Ser. The cDNAs of the mutated receptors were obtained using standard PCR approach and then transfected into COS-7 cells. The expression of the recombinant TP receptors was confirmed by Western blot (Fig.5 A). The binding of the mutated TP receptors to SQ29,548 was shown in Fig. 5. Only one recombinant TP receptor with a V176L mutation retained the binding activity to SQ29,548 (Fig. 5 B). All other mutants showed significantly decreased or lost binding activity (Fig. 5,B–E). In contrast, the control mutants of the TP receptor, Y178W and S181T, which are highly conserved in all the prostanoid receptors (Fig. 6), remained full binding activities to SQ29,548 as compared with the wild-type TP receptor (Fig.7). These results indicate that the hydrophobic side chain of Val176 is important for the interaction with SQ29,548. For the residues Leu185, Thr186, and Leu187, any structural changes to the side chain will affect TP receptor binding to its antagonist.Figure 5A, Western blot of the wild-type and mutant TP receptors on COS-7 cells.

Sugimoto Y. Ichikawa A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 109-120Google Scholar, 23Funk C.D. Furci L. Moran N. Fitzgerald G.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 934-939Google Scholar). However, most of the residues located on the transmembrane domain are covered by the extrarcellular domains of the receptor and the cell membrane molecules. The initial specific ligand docking residues shall be on the surface of the receptor molecule. Based on our molecular modeling studies, the TP receptor ligand, SQ29,548 (about 20 Å long), must contact the extracellular domains of the receptor before binding to the residues on the third and seventh transmembrane domains. It is also believed that the initial contact residues on the molecular surface shall be specific. This hypothesis comes from our previous study (1Ruan K.-H. So S.-P. Wu J. Li D. Huang A. Kung J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 275-280Google Scholar). The synthetic constrained eLP2 peptide of the TP receptor has been shown to change the conformation upon the addition of the receptor antagonist SQ29,548 using fluorescence spectroscopic studies (1Ruan K.-H. So S.-P. Wu J. Li D. Huang A. Kung J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 275-280Google Scholar). The interaction was also supported by the separated CD spectroscopic studies (1Ruan K.-H. So S.-P. Wu J. Li D. Huang A. Kung J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 275-280Google Scholar). These results provide the evidences that the second extracellular loop of the TP receptor is involved in the receptor ligand recognition. Studies from other groups also provided evidence to support the hypothesis of the second extracellular loop involving ligand recognition. Tai's group and Dorn II's group suggested that extracellular loops one and two were involved in ligand binding (25Chiang N. Kan W.M. Tai H.-H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 9-17Google Scholar, 27D'Angelo D.D. Eubank J.J. Davis M.G. Dorn II, G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6233-6240Google Scholar), with point mutations of several cysteine residues at these loops exhibiting no binding activity. Residues 198–205 in the second extracellular loop of the EP3 receptor have been reported as an essential determinant of ligand selectivity (19Audoly L. Breyer R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13475-13478Google Scholar). However, the residues responsible for the ligand recognition have not been thoroughly examined. The mutations based on alignment only are controversial and need structural information to support them. But, x-ray structure is not yet available for any mammalian G-protein-coupled receptor due to the difficulties in crystallizing the membrane-bound proteins. The structural bases of the ligand-specific recognition with the extracellular parts of the prostanoid receptors are not well known. So, characterization of the ligand recognition sites on any prostanoid receptor at the three-dimensional structural level represents a key step to reveal the specific recognition of the different prostaglandins and thromboxane by their receptors. In this paper, to further identify the interaction and localize the residues within the eLP2 region responsible for the important ligand recognition, two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy was successfully carried out and the results showed the detail contacts between the eLP2 peptide and the receptor antagonist (Fig. 2 C). The observed ligand recognition residues on the eLP2 peptide were further confirmed by the site-directed mutagenesis approach for the native TP receptor (Figs. 3and 5). The combination of the two-dimensional NMR experiments and the NMR experiment-guided mutagenesis methods provided a quicker way to identify the important ligand recognition site of the TP receptor. This approach can be used to characterize the ligand binding to other domains of the receptor. During our preparation of this manuscript, Le Breton's group reported a mapping of the ligand-binding site of the human TP receptor using photoaffinity labeling and site-specific antibody probes (28Turek J.W.

The antibody screening revealed that inhibition of the amino acid region Cys183–Asp193 was critical for radioligand binding and platelet aggregation. The studies provided evidences that the ligand interacts with amino acids within the second extracellular loop of the TP receptor (28Turek J.W. Halmos T. Sullivan N.L. Antonakis K. Le Breton G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16791-16797Google Scholar). It further supported our conclusion described in this paper in which the four residues Val176, Leu185, Thr186, and Leu187 within the second extracellular loop are identified as important residues for the receptor ligand recognition. In comparison, the combination of the two-dimensional NMR experiments and the NMR experiment-guided mutagenesis approach could give detailed structural information about the interaction of the receptor and ligand, which could not be achieved by other approaches, including general mutation approach, photoaffinity labeling, and site-specific antibody screening. The agreement among our conclusion with the photoaffinity labeling and site-specific antibody investigation has further supported the reliability of the NMR experiment-based mutagenisis approach used for the identification of the ligand recognition site of the TP receptor. One of the key factors in these studies is to design a synthetic peptide with biological function. By using a constrained peptide to mimic the extramembrane loops of TP receptor, we successfully identified the ligand recognition site for the receptor. Our identification of the important residues of TP eLP2 responsible for the contact with TP receptor ligand reported here does not exclude the other possible ligand-binding sites reported by other groups. We suspected that the ligand-docking site might differ from the final ligand-binding site, because the residues important to TP receptor ligand binding located within the transmembrane domains are conserved. The initial docking residues of the prostanoid receptors with their ligand shall be specific. The traditional alignment-based mutagenesis approach may pick up some residues, which may not be involved in direct ligand contact, but which indirectly affect the protein activity through the change of protein conformation distantly. Nevertheless, our proton level information for identification of the TP receptor ligand recognition site on the extracellular domain will serve as a very valuable tool to characterize the structure of the TP receptor ligand docking site and understand the biological mechanism of TXA2 binding to its receptor. In addition, it also provides great reference information to determine the ligand-docking sites for other prostanoid receptors, and understand the specific recognition among the eight different prostanoid receptors. In general, the NMR experiment-based mutagenesis approach is also suitable for identification of the ligand recognition sites for other G-protein-coupled receptors.

https://openalex.org/W2009605007,"The two known estrogen receptors, ERα and ERॆ, are hormone-inducible transcription factors that have distinct roles in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. Previously, our laboratory demonstrated that ERα exhibits stereoselective ligand binding and transactivation for several structural derivatives and metabolites of the synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol. We have previously described the properties of indenestrol A (IA) enantiomers on ERα. In the study presented here, the estrogenic properties of the S and Renantiomers of IA, IA-S and IA-R, respectively, were expanded to examine the activity in different cell and promoter contexts using ERα and ERॆ. Using human cell lines stably expressing either ERα or ERॆ, we found that IA-Swas a more potent activator of transcription than IA-Rthrough ERα in human endometrial Ishikawa and breast MDA-MB 231 (MDA) cells. Interestingly, IA-R was more potent on ERॆ when compared with ERα in MDA, but not in Ishikawa cells, and IA-R exhibited equally low binding affinities to ERα and ERॆ in vitro in contrast to its cell line-dependent preferential activation of ERॆ. Alignment of the protein structures of the ligand-binding domains of ERα and ERॆ revealed one mismatched residue, Leu-384 in ERα and Met-283 in ERॆ, which may be responsible for making contact with the methyl substituent at the chiral carbon of IA-S and IA-R. Mutagenesis and exchange of this one residue showed that the binding of IA-R and IA-S was not affected by this mutation in ERα and ERॆ. However, in transactivation studies, IA-R showed higher potency in activating L384M-mutated ERα and wild-type ERॆ compared with wild-type ERα and M283L-mutated ERॆ in all cell and promoter contexts examined. Furthermore, IA-R-bound ERα L384M and wild-type ERॆ displayed enhanced interactions with the nuclear receptor interaction domains of the coactivators SRC-1 and GRIP1. These data demonstrate that a single residue in the ligand-binding domain determines the stereoselectivity of ERα and ERॆ for indenestrol ligands and that IA-R shows cell type selectivity through ERॆ. The two known estrogen receptors, ERα and ERॆ, are hormone-inducible transcription factors that have distinct roles in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation.

Couse J.F. Korach K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36869-36872Google Scholar). Studies using knock-out mice for the two ER subtypes (αERKO and ॆERKO, respectively) have revealed that each receptor plays a unique role in estrogen biology in a wide variety of target tissues (2Couse J.F. Korach K.S. Endocrinol. Rev. 1999; 20: 358-417Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vitro studies indicated that ERα and ERॆ display marked differences in binding affinity and activation by natural and synthetic ER ligands (3Kuiper G.G. Lemmen J.G. Carlsson B.

Gustafsson J. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 863-870Google Scholar). Interestingly, although ERॆ shows lower binding affinity for and activation by endogenous estrogens, several xenoestrogens preferentially bind and activate ERॆ (3Kuiper G.G. Lemmen J.G. Carlsson B. Corton J.C. Safe S.H. van der Saag P.T. van der Burg B. Gustafsson J.A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4252-4263Google Scholar). These observations have prompted further studies aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanisms of action of ERα and ERॆ, and the search for ER subtype-selective agonists that could be used to evaluate the physiological roles of each receptor.Diethylstilbestrol (DES) is a known carcinogen, which is oxidatively metabolized to a variety of metabolites with varying degrees of hormonal activity (34Korach K.S. Metzler M. McLachlan J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 468-471Google Scholar). Indenestrol A (IA) is a metabolite derived from DES that has high binding affinity for ERα but weak biological activity (35Korach K.S. Metzler M. McLachlan J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8963-8968Google Scholar). IA exists as a racemic mixture of enantiomers, IA-S and IA-R (36Korach K.S. Chae K. Levy L.A. Duax W.L. Sarver P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5642-5647Google Scholar), which have a methyl substitution on the chiral carbon (Fig. 1). Previously, our laboratory demonstrated that IA-R displays a lower binding affinity and transactivation potency on ERα than IA-S (5Kohno H. Bocchinfuso W.P. Gandini O. Curtis S.W. Korach K.S. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 16: 277-285Google Scholar), which may help explain the differential biological activity and allow the study of the stereoselectivity of ligand binding and transcriptional responses of ERs.The discovery of ERॆ prompted us to investigate whether both ER subtypes would exhibit the same stereoselectivity for the IA enantiomers. Human ERα and ERॆ share high sequence homology (977) in the central DNA-binding domain, but only moderate conservation (607) in the C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) and activation function-2 (AF-2). Since AF-2 mediates the ligand-dependent transcriptional activities of both ER subtypes (1Hall J.M. Couse J.F. Korach K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36869-36872Google Scholar), it is possible that structural differences within this region could account for differences in the specificities of ERα and ERॆ for several estrogenic chemicals (4Kuiper G.G.J.M. Carlsson B. Grandien K. Enmark E. Haggblad J. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 863-870Google Scholar, 6Barkhem T. Carlsson B. Nilsson Y. Enmark E. Gustafsson J. Nilsson S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 105-112Google Scholar).To expand our knowledge about the molecular determinants of the stereoselectivity of ERα and ERॆ, we have characterized the ability of IA-S and IA-R to function as agonists/antagonists of the two ER subtypes. For the study of ER subtype-specific activation, stable cell lines were established by transfecting MDA-MB 231 (human breast adenocarcinoma; MDA) and Ishikawa (human uterine adenocarcinoma) cells with human or mouse ERα or ERॆ. Using these cell models and in vitro binding assays, the ability of the IA enantiomers to bind ERα and ERॆ, activate ERE-mediated transcription, and regulate coactivator recruitment was studied and compared between the two ER subtypes. Alignment of the LBDs of ERα and ERॆ revealed one mismatched amino acid (Leu-384 and Met-283, respectively) that may be responsible for making contact with the methyl substituent at the chiral carbon of IA-S and IA-R. This observation suggested that this residue could account for the functional differences observed between the two ER subtypes, a hypothesis that was further investigated in this study.DISCUSSIONPreviously, our laboratory and others (5Kohno H. Bocchinfuso W.P. Gandini O. Curtis S.W. Korach K.S. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 16: 277-285Google Scholar, 22Bocchinfuso W.P. Korach K.S. Mol.

Biol. 1999; 19: 3895-3903Google Scholar) determined that ERα exhibits stereoselective ligand activation and identified potential molecular determinants for ERα ligand-dependent activation and stereoselectivity. With the discovery of ERॆ (3Kuiper G.G. Lemmen J.G. Carlsson B. Corton J.C. Safe S.H. van der Saag P.T. van der Burg B. Gustafsson J.A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4252-4263Google Scholar, 4Kuiper G.G.J.M. Carlsson B. Grandien K. Enmark E. Haggblad J. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 863-870Google Scholar) the question emerged as to whether ERॆ also exhibits stereoselective ligand activation; this may explain the activity of the DES-type compounds as noted in the present studies and may elucidate the functional properties of ERॆ. Complementary to this mechanistic question is the search for ER subtype-specific agonists or antagonists that would permit the identification of distinct activities and roles for ERα and ERॆ in estrogen target tissues. Katzenellenbogen and co-workers (26Sun J. Meyers M.J. Fink B.E. Rajendran R. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 800-804Google Scholar) were the first to determine the stereoselectivity of ERॆ using a chiral tetrahydrocrysene (THC). They found that the enantiomer R,R-THC activates ERα but is an antagonist on ERॆ, whereas S,S-THC is an agonist on both ERα and ERॆ (26Sun J. Meyers M.J. Fink B.E. Rajendran R. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 800-804Google Scholar).We showed in an earlier report that IA-S is a strong ERα agonist, whereas IA-R displayed only weak agonistic activity in a reconstituted ER transcription system in yeast (8Mueller S.O. Korach K.S. J. Androl. 2001; 22: 652-664Google Scholar). In the study described here, we further explored the activity profile of these DES derivatives by determining the potency of the enantiomers of IA to activate ERα and ERॆ in different cell and promoter contexts. For analysis of cell type specificity, we generated human mammary and endometrial cell lines that stably express mouse or human ERα or ERॆ. In transactivation studies using the cell lines generated, IA-S and IA-R exhibited agonistic and partial agonistic properties, respectively, through ERα and ERॆ for all cell and promoter contexts examined. This demonstrated that both IA enantiomers have agonistic properties similar to E2 and DES, but with differing degrees.However, although both IA enantiomers function as agonists of both ER subtypes, each ligand differed markedly with regard to its potency as an activator of ERα or ERॆ. The IA enantiomer IA-R was a more potent activator of ERॆ compared with ERα in human mammary MDA cells. In endometrial Ishikawa cells, IA-R showed higher potency of activation on mERॆ than mERα. However, both hERα and hERॆ showed a similar ability to activate transcription from the C3 reporter in the presence of IA-R, whereas IA-Rwas a more potent activator of hERॆ than hERα on the more sensitive 3×ERE reporter. Taken together, these results indicated that IA-R could function as a potency and cell type-selective ERॆ agonist in MDA cells when compared with the endometrial Ishikawa cell line. Data reported here also indicated that ERॆ bound to IA-S is transcriptionally active to a similar degree in both mammary and endometrial cells. These findings support the notion that the activity of the ER can be dependent on the cellular context, as highlighted by the cell type-specific mixed agonist/antagonist activity of the selective ER modulator tamoxifen through ERα (27McDonnell D.P. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 10: 301-311Google Scholar).The fact that IA-R is a weak agonist for ERα in all cell and promoter contexts examined suggests that either IA-R has a low binding affinity for ERα and/or the conformation of IA-R-liganded ERα does not favor activation. IA-R exhibited comparably low binding affinities for ERα and ERॆ, which might be responsible for the weak activation of ERα by IA-R. However, the low binding affinity of IA-R for ERॆ is not predictive of its higher potency to activate ERॆ in MDA cells as compared with ERα. Paige et al. (28Paige L.A. Christensen D.J. Gron H. Norris J.D. Gottlin E.B. Padilla K.M. Chang C.Y. Ballas L.M. Hamilton P.T. McDonnell D.P. Fowlkes D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3999-4004Google Scholar) used affinity-selected peptides to show that ERα and ERॆ assume ligand-specific conformations, which are likely to modulate the activity of the liganded receptors. It is therefore reasonable to assume that a conformational change could cause the differential potencies of the activation of ERα versusERॆ by IA-R, i.e. IA-R induces a conformational change permissive of ligand-dependent activation principally of ERॆ, but only minimally of ERα.Recent studies analyzed the conformational changes that occur in ERα and ERॆ upon binding of the ER subtype-specific THC ligands (29Kraichely D.M. Sun J. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3534-3545Google Scholar, 30Tyulmenkov V.V. Klinge C.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 381: 135-142Google Scholar). Kraichely et al. (29Kraichely D.M. Sun J. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3534-3545Google Scholar) showed that the THCs induced a distinct conformation of the receptors concomitant with quantitative differences in coactivator recruitment. They concluded that the ligand-dependent conformational change favors association of the receptor with coactivators and through that interaction causes transactivation by the ER. This mode of action is mechanistically described by the tripartite model of steroid hormone receptor action (31Katzenellenbogen J.A. O'Malley B.W. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 119-131Google Scholar). This model takes into account the ligand binding affinity, the conformation of liganded receptor, and the association of the receptor with coregulator molecules, i.e. coactivators. In line with this model, we hypothesized that IA-R permits transcriptional activation of ERॆ but not of ERα, due to induction of a conformation resulting in altered coactivator recruitment.We performed studies to test this hypothesis through experiments pinpointing the molecular determinants responsible for the differences in transactivation between ERα and ERॆ when bound by IA-R. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of the LBD of ERα and ERॆ revealed one mismatched residue within the LBD, Leu-384 in ERα and Met-283 in ERॆ that is likely to be proximal to the methyl substituent of the chiral carbon in IA based on the crystal structure data of liganded ERα and ERॆ (18Pike A.C.W. Brzozowski A.M. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Thorsell A.G. Engstrom O. Ljunggren J. Gustafsson J.K. Carlquist M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4608-4618Google Scholar, 19Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Loria P.M. Cheng L. Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 927-937Google Scholar). Given this information, we speculated that this residue could interfere with the bound IA, inducing a distinct conformational change either facilitating or impeding activation by ER. Indeed, when this residue was exchanged in ERα and ERॆ, the potency of activation of mutated ERα L384M and ERॆ M283L by IA-R changed accordingly: IA-Rwas a more potent activator of transcription of ERα L384M compared with wild-type ERα and also a less potent activator of mutated ERॆ M283L compared with wild-type ERॆ. Importantly, this shift in activation of IA-R was independent of the cellular and promoter context tested and, furthermore, the activities of IA-S, as well as of DES and E2 were not markedly affected by the Leu/Met mutational exchange. This suggests that IA-R has a unique ligand structure that is sensitive to this residue in the binding pocket and subsequently affects receptor conformation. As expected by the low binding affinity of IA-R observed for ERα and ERॆ, this mutation did not affect the binding affinities of IA-R or IA-S to ERα and ERॆ, supporting the concept of dissociation of ligand binding affinity from biological transcriptional activity. The residues Leu-384 in ERα and Met-283 in ERॆ are therefore likely to be important molecular determinants for the ER subtype-specific activity of IA-R.Several studies have analyzed the molecular determinants of ligand-dependent activation of ERα (5Kohno H. Bocchinfuso W.P. Gandini O. Curtis S.W. Korach K.S. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 16: 277-285Google Scholar, 22Bocchinfuso W.P. Korach K.S. Mol.

In most of these reports, mutations of residues in helices 11 and 12 of the AF-2 domain were described, and results indicated reduced DNA and/or ligand binding accompanied by weaker transactivation. Studies on the enantiomers of indenestrol showed that none of the ERα mutants analyzed reversed the stereoselectivity of ERα (5Kohno H. Bocchinfuso W.P. Gandini O. Curtis S.W. Korach K.S. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 16: 277-285Google Scholar, 22Bocchinfuso W.P. Korach K.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 587-594Google Scholar). In the latter study and in results presented here, the higher potency of IA-S to induce ERα activity was accompanied by a higher binding affinity of IA-S to ERα as compared with IA-R (36Korach K.S. Chae K. Levy L.A. Duax W.L. Sarver P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5642-5647Google Scholar). Here, we showed that Leu-384 in helix 6 of hERα impedes the activation mediated by IA-R, independent of its binding affinity. Feng et al. (33Feng W. Ribeiro R.C.n. J. Wagner R.L. Nguyen H. Apriletti J.W. Fletterick R.J. Baxter J.D. Kushner P.J. West B.L. Science. 1998; 280: 1747-1749Google Scholar) mutated the residues of lysine 362 in helix 3, valine 376 in helix 5, or glutamic acid 542 in helix 12 of the hERα LBD. All three mutations independently resulted in diminished transcriptional activity and coactivator binding (33Feng W. Ribeiro R.C.n. J. Wagner R.L. Nguyen H. Apriletti J.W. Fletterick R.J. Baxter J.D. Kushner P.J. West B.L. Science. 1998; 280: 1747-1749Google Scholar). Similar results were reported for mERα; Mak et al. (25Mak H.Y. Hoare S. Henttu P.M. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3895-3903Google Scholar) mutated residues in the LBD and showed that the hydrophobic surface in the LBD, specifically Leu-376 in mERα, which corresponds to leucine 379 in hERα, is required for binding of the coactivator SRC-1 and subsequent transactivation. In this report, we examined and compared the putative molecular determinants of the ligand specificity of both ERα and ERॆ. The leucine 384 residue of ERα impeded transactivation by IA-R, but not by other ligands, and therefore might also impede recruitment of coactivators only when IA-R is bound. In contrast, methionine 283 in the LBD of ERॆ enhanced transactivation induced by IA-R, which might be due to a conformational change leading to increased interactions with coactivators. Indeed, the interaction of SRC-1 and GRIP1 in the presence of IA-R, which was a more potent activator of hERα L384M and hERॆ compared with hERα and hERॆ M283L, was enhanced when the methionine residue was present in hERα (hERα L384M) and in wild-type hERॆ. Taken together, this agrees with our suggested mechanism of IA-R activation: that IA-R, albeit with low binding affinity, induces a conformational change in ERॆ that facilitates ligand-dependent activation, whereas IA-R bound to ERα is unable to induce a favorable conformation and impedes activation.In conclusion, this series of studies has revealed that IA-Ris a potency-selective agonist for ERॆ in a cell type-specific manner, and a single residue in the LBD of ERα and ERॆ modulates their transcriptional activity in a cell type-independent fashion. Analysis of conformational changes and crystallographic and structural analysis of wild-type and mutated ERα and ERॆ bound to subtype specific agonists would further extend our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and structural determinants of ligand-specific transcriptional activity of ERα and ERॆ. The estrogenic effects of a variety of structurally diverse endogenous and xenobiotic compounds are mediated through the estrogen receptors (ERα and ERॆ),1which function as ligand-inducible transcription factors for genes involved in cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation (1Hall J.M. Couse J.F. Korach K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36869-36872Google Scholar). Studies using knock-out mice for the two ER subtypes (αERKO and ॆERKO, respectively) have revealed that each receptor plays a unique role in estrogen biology in a wide variety of target tissues (2Couse J.F. Korach K.S. Endocrinol. Rev. 1999; 20: 358-417Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vitro studies indicated that ERα and ERॆ display marked differences in binding affinity and activation by natural and synthetic ER ligands (3Kuiper G.G. Lemmen J.G. Carlsson B.

Interestingly, although ERॆ shows lower binding affinity for and activation by endogenous estrogens, several xenoestrogens preferentially bind and activate ERॆ (3Kuiper G.G. Lemmen J.G. Carlsson B. Corton J.C. Safe S.H. van der Saag P.T. van der Burg B. Gustafsson J.A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4252-4263Google Scholar). These observations have prompted further studies aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanisms of action of ERα and ERॆ, and the search for ER subtype-selective agonists that could be used to evaluate the physiological roles of each receptor. Diethylstilbestrol (DES) is a known carcinogen, which is oxidatively metabolized to a variety of metabolites with varying degrees of hormonal activity (34Korach K.S. Metzler M. McLachlan J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 468-471Google Scholar). Indenestrol A (IA) is a metabolite derived from DES that has high binding affinity for ERα but weak biological activity (35Korach K.S. Metzler M. McLachlan J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8963-8968Google Scholar). IA exists as a racemic mixture of enantiomers, IA-S and IA-R (36Korach K.S. Chae K. Levy L.A. Duax W.L. Sarver P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5642-5647Google Scholar), which have a methyl substitution on the chiral carbon (Fig. 1). Previously, our laboratory demonstrated that IA-R displays a lower binding affinity and transactivation potency on ERα than IA-S (5Kohno H. Bocchinfuso W.P. Gandini O. Curtis S.W. Korach K.S. J. Mol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 36869-36872Google Scholar), it is possible that structural differences within this region could account for differences in the specificities of ERα and ERॆ for several estrogenic chemicals (4Kuiper G.G.J.M. Carlsson B. Grandien K. Enmark E. Haggblad J. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 863-870Google Scholar, 6Barkhem T. Carlsson B. Nilsson Y. Enmark E. Gustafsson J. Nilsson S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 105-112Google Scholar). To expand our knowledge about the molecular determinants of the stereoselectivity of ERα and ERॆ, we have characterized the ability of IA-S and IA-R to function as agonists/antagonists of the two ER subtypes. For the study of ER subtype-specific activation, stable cell lines were established by transfecting MDA-MB 231 (human breast adenocarcinoma; MDA) and Ishikawa (human uterine adenocarcinoma) cells with human or mouse ERα or ERॆ. Using these cell models and in vitro binding assays, the ability of the IA enantiomers to bind ERα and ERॆ, activate ERE-mediated transcription, and regulate coactivator recruitment was studied and compared between the two ER subtypes. Alignment of the LBDs of ERα and ERॆ revealed one mismatched amino acid (Leu-384 and Met-283, respectively) that may be responsible for making contact with the methyl substituent at the chiral carbon of IA-S and IA-R. This observation suggested that this residue could account for the functional differences observed between the two ER subtypes, a hypothesis that was further investigated in this study.

Biol. 1999; 19: 3895-3903Google Scholar) determined that ERα exhibits stereoselective ligand activation and identified potential molecular determinants for ERα ligand-dependent activation and stereoselectivity. With the discovery of ERॆ (3Kuiper G.G. Lemmen J.G. Carlsson B. Corton J.C. Safe S.H. van der Saag P.T. van der Burg B. Gustafsson J.A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4252-4263Google Scholar, 4Kuiper G.G.J.M. Carlsson B. Grandien K. Enmark E. Haggblad J. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 863-870Google Scholar) the question emerged as to whether ERॆ also exhibits stereoselective ligand activation; this may explain the activity of the DES-type compounds as noted in the present studies and may elucidate the functional properties of ERॆ. Complementary to this mechanistic question is the search for ER subtype-specific agonists or antagonists that would permit the identification of distinct activities and roles for ERα and ERॆ in estrogen target tissues. Katzenellenbogen and co-workers (26Sun J. Meyers M.J. Fink B.E. Rajendran R. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 800-804Google Scholar) were the first to determine the stereoselectivity of ERॆ using a chiral tetrahydrocrysene (THC). They found that the enantiomer R,R-THC activates ERα but is an antagonist on ERॆ, whereas S,S-THC is an agonist on both ERα and ERॆ (26Sun J. Meyers M.J. Fink B.E. Rajendran R. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 800-804Google Scholar).We showed in an earlier report that IA-S is a strong ERα agonist, whereas IA-R displayed only weak agonistic activity in a reconstituted ER transcription system in yeast (8Mueller S.O. Korach K.S. J. Androl. 2001; 22: 652-664Google Scholar). In the study described here, we further explored the activity profile of these DES derivatives by determining the potency of the enantiomers of IA to activate ERα and ERॆ in different cell and promoter contexts. For analysis of cell type specificity, we generated human mammary and endometrial cell lines that stably express mouse or human ERα or ERॆ. In transactivation studies using the cell lines generated, IA-S and IA-R exhibited agonistic and partial agonistic properties, respectively, through ERα and ERॆ for all c"
https://openalex.org/W2125277887,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent keratinocyte-derived angiogenic factor. Prior reports suggest that following UV irradiation VEGF in keratinocytes is induced primarily by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- alpha, a cytokine synthesized and secreted by keratinocytes after UV irradiation. We investigated whether blocking TNF-alpha binding to its receptors would inhibit UV-induced VEGF expression and secretion in the keratinocyte-derived line SCC-12F. Irradiation with physiologic UV doses (30 mJ/cm2) substantially induced VEGF mRNA in this cell line, as expected, and mRNA induction was followed by increased VEGF in medium conditioned by UV-irradiated cells. Also as expected, TNF-alpha induced VEGF expression and secretion in a dose-dependent manner. Addition of a hexapeptide (Ac-KWIIVW-NH2), known to block TNF-alpha binding to its receptors, abrogated this TNF-alpha effect on VEGF mRNA induction. However, addition of the peptide to cells immediately after UV irradiation did not substantially affect VEGF mRNA induction or secretion into the medium. Our results suggest that VEGF induction after UV irradiation is mediated by multiple mechanisms and that blocking a single pathway does not affect the response."

In the neutrophil, a specific NADP+-dependent dehydrogenase utilizes 5-lipoxygenase-derived 5-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5(S)-HETE) as the required substrate. In the present study, 5-hydroperoxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-HpETE), rather than 5-HETE, was found to be the biosynthetic precursor of 5-oxo-ETE in the murine macrophage. The macrophage was not able to convert 5-HETE into 5-oxo-ETE even when preincubated with phorbol ester or with other lipid hydroperoxides. The factor responsible for the conversion of 5-HpETE into 5-oxo-ETE was found predominantly in the cytosolic fraction of the macrophage, with an approximate molecular weight of 50,000–60,000, as assessed by size exclusion chromatography. Formation of 5-oxo-ETE was rapid and the catalytic protein was found to have an apparent K m of 5.3 μm for the eicosanoid. Furthermore, the protein could efficiently utilize 5(R,S)-HpETE as substrate and was heat and protease labile. This novel pathway of 5-oxo-ETE biosynthesis in the murine macrophage was consistent with reduction of a 5-hydroperoxy group to an intermediate alkoxy radical that could be subsequently oxidized to the 5-oxo product. Such a mechanism would enable racemic 5-HpETE, derived from free radical oxidation of arachidonic acid, to be efficiently converted into this potent chemotactic eicosanoid. 5-Oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE) is a metabolite of arachidonic acid shown to possess important biological activities within different cell types.

One biosynthetic pathway involves 5-lipoxygenase, which initiates a cascade of arachidonic acid metabolism leading ultimately to the formation of a group of biologically active compounds, including the leukotrienes (1Funk C.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1871-1875Google Scholar). The molecular events directed by 5-lipoxygenase involve insertion of molecular oxygen at carbon-5 of the arachidonate chain with formation of 5(S)-hydroperoxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5(S)-HpETE),1which can be reduced by peroxidases to the hydroxy analog 5(S)-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5(S)-HETE) or stereospecifically dehydrated to leukotriene A4 (LTA4) by a second 5-lipoxygenase-catalyzed step (2Shimizu T. Izumi T. Seyama Y. Tadokoro K. Radmark O. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4175-4179Google Scholar). LTA4 can be further converted into LTB4 by the enzyme LTA4 hydrolase (3Haeggström J.Z. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 161: S25-S31Google Scholar) or into the cysteinyl-leukotrienes LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 by the enzyme LTC4 synthase (4Lam B.K. Austen F.K. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 161: S16-S19Google Scholar). LTB4 is a potent chemokinetic and chemotactic agent for the human polymorphonuclear leukocyte (5Ford-Hutchinson A.W. Bray M.A. Doig M.V. Shipley M.E. Smith M.J. Nature. 1980; 286: 264-265Google Scholar), whereas LTC4 and LTD4 are among the most potent mediators of bronchoconstriction in man (6Dahlen S.E. Hedqvist P. Hammarström S. Samuelsson B. Nature. 1980; 288: 484-486Google Scholar). More recently, another 5-lipoxygenase metabolite, 5-oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE), has been identified as being made within human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (7Powell W.S. Gravelle F. Gravel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19233-19241Google Scholar, 8Powell W.S. Gravelle F. Gravel S. Hashefi M. J. Lipid Mediat. 1993; 6: 361-368Google Scholar), eosinophils (9Schwenk U. Morita E. Engel R. Schröder J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12482-12488Google Scholar), monocytes, and lymphocytes (10Zhang Y. Styhler A. Powell W.S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 847-854Google Scholar). This eicosanoid elicits a different set of important biological activities as a potent agonist increasing cytosolic calcium levels, chemotaxis, and degranulation by a mechanism independent of the LTB4receptor in the human neutrophil (11Powell W.S. Gravel S. MacLeod R.J. Mills E. Hashefi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9280-9286Google Scholar, 12O'Flaherty J.T. Cordes J. Redman J. Thomas M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 129-134Google Scholar). Low concentrations have been shown to increase the surface expression of the β2integrin CD11b, actin polymerization and adherence (13Powell W.S. Gravel S. Halwani F. Hii C.S. Huang Z.H. Tan A. Ferrante A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2952-2959Google Scholar). It is the most active lipid-derived chemoattractant factor for human eosinophils (14Powell W.S. Chung D. Gravel S. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4123-4132Google Scholar,15Schwenk U. Schröder J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15029-15036Google Scholar), with a potency in the range of the CC chemokines, eotaxin and RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted), both of which also enhance 5-oxo-ETE-induced chemotaxis (16Powell W.S. Ahmed S. Gravel S. Rokach J. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2001; 107: 272-278Google Scholar). This keto eicosanoid also causes L-selectin shedding, surface expression of CD11b, calcium mobilization, and actin polymerization (17Powell W.S. Gravel S. Halwani F. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 163-170Google Scholar). It can also activate directional migration and actin polymerization within the human monocyte (18Sozzani S. Zhou D. Locati M. Bernasconi S. Luini W. Mantovani A. O'Flaherty J.T. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4664-4671Google Scholar), and lead to volume reduction of guinea pig intestinal epithelial cells (19MacLeod R.J. Lembessis P. Hamilton J.R. Powell W.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 291: 511-516Google Scholar). Furthermore, 5-oxo-ETE has been shown to promote eosinophil transmigration through basement membranes (20Guilbert M. Ferland C. Bossé M. Flamand N. Lavigne S. Laviolette M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 21: 97-104Google Scholar), suggesting an important role for this eicosanoid in the recruitment of these potent inflammatory cells in pathologic conditions such as asthma and allergy. Recently, a specific G-protein-linked receptor with high affinity for 5-oxo-ETE has been reported (21Hosoi T. Koguchi Y. Sugikawa E. Chikada A. Ogawa K. Tsuda N. Suto N. Tsunoda S. Taniguchi T. Ohnuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31459-31465Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of 5-oxo-ETE has been extensively examined in human neutrophils with the identification of a specific microsomal NADP+-dependent dehydrogenase responsible for the conversion of 5(S)-HETE, but not 5(R)-HETE (7Powell W.S. Gravelle F. Gravel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19233-19241Google Scholar). In intact cells, significant amounts of this metabolite are synthesized only when neutrophils are preincubated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), a protein kinase C activator that elevates NADP+ (22Powell W.S. Gravelle F. Gravel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25373-25380Google Scholar). The same biosynthetic pathway for 5-oxo-ETE has been also identified in human monocytes and lymphocytes (10Zhang Y. Styhler A. Powell W.S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 847-854Google Scholar). An alternative pathway for 5-oxo-ETE synthesis could proceed from 5-HpETE, because unsaturated fatty acid hydroperoxides have been shown to be direct precursors of oxo-fatty acids catalyzed by hematin and heme-containing proteins such as hemoglobin (23Dix T.A. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5351-5357Google Scholar, 24Hamberg M. Lipids. 1975; 10: 87-92Google Scholar). In a similar manner, platelet 12-lipoxygenase and soybean 15-lipoxygenase under anaerobic conditions has been shown to convert 12-HpETE and 15-HpETE, respectively, into the corresponding 12- and 15-oxo derivatives (25Fruteau de Laclos B. Borgeat P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 958: 424-433Google Scholar). Recently, 5-oxo-ETE was found to be an eicosanoid synthesized within the elicited murine peritoneal macrophage (26Hevko J.M. Bowers R.C. Murphy R.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 293-305Google Scholar), but the pathway responsible for the production of 5-oxo-ETE was not investigated. The objective of the present study was to define the biosynthetic pathway that leads to the synthesis of 5-oxo-ETE in the macrophage and elucidate the mechanism responsible for the formation of this keto eicosanoid in this cell type. 5-Oxo-ETE, 5(S)-HETE, 5(S)-HpETE, 5(R,S)-HpETE, 15(S)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15(S)-HpETE), 13(S)-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid (13(S)-HpODE), d 8-5-HETE, and d 7-5-oxo-ETE were purchased from Cayman Chemical Company (Ann Arbor, MI). All solvents were HPLC grade and obtained from Fisher. Type I “plus” water was obtained using a MilliQ water system (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) fed with deionized water. CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture tablets were obtained from Roche Molecular Diagnostics. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Hanks' balanced salt solution were purchased from Cellgro by Mediatech Inc. (Herndon, VA). Stannous chloride anhydrous (SnCl2), PMA, trypsin, hematin, and phosphate-buffered saline were purchased from Sigma. Thioglycollate was purchased from BD Difco (Franklin Lakes, NJ). Elicited macrophages were obtained by injecting 1 ml of 4% thioglycollate into the peritoneum of ICR mice. After 3 days, the mice were euthanized in a CO2 atmosphere. For the experiments with intact cells, the peritoneum was lavaged once with 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin, and peritoneal macrophages were plated onto polystyrene 6-well cell culture dishes (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) at a concentration of 3 × 106 cells/well. For some experiments, the peritoneum was lavaged once with 10 ml of cold Hanks' balanced salt solution and cells were kept in suspension at the concentration of 20–30 × 106 cells/ml. Peritoneal macrophages were washed once with lysis buffer (NaCl, 0.4 m; phosphate buffer, 0.2 m, pH 7.4; and one CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture tablet for each 20 ml of buffer) and then resuspended in lysis buffer at the concentration of 100 × 106 cells/ml. Cells were disrupted by sonication and then centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C; the resulting supernatant was subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The cytosolic fraction (supernatant) and the pellet (microsomal fraction), resuspended in lysis buffer, were kept on ice until used. For some experiments the cytosol fraction (100 μl) was resuspended in a boiling water bath (94 °C) for 20 min prior to testing for enzymatic activity. Plated macrophages were washed twice with 1 ml of KRPD buffer (KCl, 4.8 mm;CaCl2, 0.97 mm; MgSO4, 1.2 mm; NaH2PO4, 3.1 mm;Na2HPO4, 12.5 mm; and dextrose, 0.2%) and incubations were performed in 1 ml of KRPD. After 5 min of thermal equilibration at 37 °C, macrophages were incubated with 5(S)-HpETE or 5(R,S)-HpETE (1 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C; supernatants were then collected in 1 volume of ice-cold methanol containing 5 ng ofd 8-5-HETE and 10 ng ofd 7-5-oxo-ETE as internal standards. Identical incubations were conducted using human neutrophils (3 × 106/ml) prepared according to the method of Haslettet al. (27Haslett C. Guthrie L.A. Kopaniak M.M. Johnston R.B. Henson P.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1985; 119: 101-110Google Scholar). Additional experiments were performed in macrophages, where 5(S)-HETE (1 μm) was coincubated with 15(S)-HpETE or 13(S)-HpODE (1 μm) and 5(S)-HpETE (1 μm) withd 8-5(S)-HETE (2 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C. Human neutrophils and murine macrophages (5 × 106 cells/ml in Hanks' balanced salt solution) were preincubated with either PMA (final concentration 30 nm) or vehicle (Me2SO) for 6 min at 37 °C and then 5(S)-HETE (final concentration, 1 μm) was added and incubated for an additional 20 min. Cytosolic and microsomal fractions from 5 × 106 macrophages (diluted with lysis buffer to 1 ml) were incubated with 5(S)-HpETE (1 μm) or 5(R,S)-HpETE (1 μm) for 10 min at 37 °C, after 5 min of thermal equilibration; incubations were terminated with 1 volume of ice-cold methanol containing the internal standards. Cytosolic fractions were also incubated with 5(S)-HpETE or 5(S)-HETE (1 μm for 10 min at 37 °C) after pretreatment for 5 min at 37 °C with different cofactors (NADP+, NADPH, NADH, all at the concentration of 1 mm), and further experiments were conducted by boiling the cytosol for 20 min or adding trypsin (2.5 mg/ml) to the cytosol preparation for 10 min at 37 °C and incubating it with 5(S)-HpETE (1 μm) for 10 min at 37 °C. Time course experiments were performed incubating cytosolic fractions from 5 × 106 macrophages with 5(S)-HpETE (1 μm) at the times indicated at 37 °C, after a 5-min thermal equilibration. The effect of 5-HpETE concentration on 5-oxo-ETE synthesis was studied with increasing concentrations of 5(S)-HpETE (0.1–100 μm) for 1 min at 37 °C. In separate experiments, 13-HpODE and 15-HpETE (1 μm) were incubated with the cytosol fraction under identical conditions. Protein content in the cytosol aliquots was determined by the microbicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce) protocol using bovine serum albumin as standard. The quantitative analysis of 5-oxo-ETE production in each incubation was carried out by stable isotope dilution mass spectrometry. Because the conversion from 5-HpETE to 5-oxo-ETE has been reported as an artifact of HPLC analysis (25Fruteau de Laclos B. Borgeat P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 958: 424-433Google Scholar), SnCl2 (100 mm ethanol stock solution) was added to each sample (0.5 mm final concentration) for 30 min at room temperature before solid phase extraction. This chemically reduced any remaining 5-HpETE into 5-HETE prior to HPLC separation. Supernatants from different experiments were diluted with water to a final concentration of less than 20% methanol and solid phase extraction was performed using Bond-Elut C18 cartridges (Varian Inc., Harbor City, CA), preconditioned with 1 ml of methanol and washed with 1 ml of water; methanol eluates (1 ml) were taken to dryness using a SpeedVac evaporating centrifuge (Savant Instruments, Farmingdale, NY), reconstituted in 40 μl of HPLC mobile phase A (8.3 mmacetic acid buffered to pH 5.7 with NH4OH) + 20 μl of methanol, and injected into an HPLC gradient pump system directly interfaced into the electrospray source of a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Sciex API 3000, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada). A linear gradient from 15% mobile phase B (acetonitrile/methanol, 65/35, v/v) to 100% B was used to elute a 150 × 1-mm Columbus 5-μm C18 reversed phase column (Phenomenex, Rancho Palos Verde, CA), at the flow rate of 50 μl/min. Mobile phase B was increased from 15 to 55% in 10 min, to 80% in 25 min, to 100% in 30 min and held at 100% B for a further 5 min. Mass spectrometric analyses were performed in the negative ion mode using multiple reaction monitoring of the specific transitionsm/z 317 → 203 for 5-oxo-ETE,m/z 319 → 115 for 5-HETE,m/z 324 → 210 ford 7-5-oxo-ETE, and m/z 327 → 116 for d 8-5-HETE eluting from the RP-HPLC column. Quantitation of 5-oxo-ETE and 5-HETE in different samples was performed using a standard isotope dilution curve as previously described (28Hall L.M. Murphy R.C. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 9: 527-532Google Scholar). The quantitation of 13-oxo-octadecadienoic (m/z 253 → 113) and 15-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acids (m/z 317 → 113) were carried out in a similar fashion. Aliquots of 10 μl of macrophage cytosolic fractions and boiled cytosol fractions were loaded on a hydrophilic bonded silica size exclusion column (BioSep-SEC-S2000 Peek 300 × 7.50 mm, Phenomenex) eluted with phosphate buffer, 200 mm, pH 7.3, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min; 1-min fractions were collected from the column for 14 min. Aliquots of 10 μl from each fraction were then tested for activity by incubating them with 5(S)-HpETE (1 μm) for 10 min at 37 °C and further analyzed by RP-HPLC followed by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. Identical experiments were conducted using cytosolic and boiled cytosolic fractions pretreated for 5 min at room temperature with hematin (0.5 and 5 μm) and with cytosolic fractions pretreated with trypsin (2.5 mg/ml) for 10 min at 37 °C. A standard curve to assess the approximate molecular weight corresponding to each fraction collected was built by injecting on the same column 50 μg of each of the following proteins: IgG (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), glutathione S-transferase (25 kDa), insulin (5800 Da), and vitamin B12 (1355 kDa); UV absorbance was monitored at 214 and 280 nm. Elicited peritoneal macrophages (3 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 5(S)-HETE (1 μm) and the formation of specific products was analyzed by combined liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Specific ion transitions formed by collisional activation were monitored to detect the elution of 5-oxo-ETE (m/z 317 → 203) and 5-HETE (m/z 319 → 115) as well as internal standards added in this experiment for quantitative analysis,d 8-5-HETE (m/z 327 → 116) and d 7-5-oxo-ETE (m/z324 → 210). There was no significant production of 5-oxo-ETE derived from the exogenously added 5-HETE in the murine macrophage (Fig.1); in contrast, the incubation of 5-HETE with human polymorphonuclear leukocytes resulted in the formation of a small, but clearly measurable 5-oxo-ETE (0.58 ± 0.02 ng/106 cells) as previously reported (22Powell W.S. Gravelle F. Gravel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25373-25380Google Scholar). When PMA was added to the intact cells to stimulate the NADPH oxidase (22Powell W.S. Gravelle F. Gravel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25373-25380Google Scholar), there was still no conversion of 5-HETE to 5-oxo-ETE by the macrophage, but a significant stimulation of polymorphonuclear leukocyte production of 5-oxo-ETE (3.95 ± 0.14 ng/106 cells) was observed. These results suggested a substantial difference in the biosynthetic pathway leading to 5-oxo-ETE in the murine macrophage compared with the previously described pathway from 5-HETE in the neutrophil. When elicited macrophages were incubated under identical conditions with 5(S)-HpETE (1 μm) followed by purification and analysis by mass spectrometry, a significant production of 5-oxo-ETE (7.13 ± 0.56 ng/106 cells) was observed (Fig. 2). Furthermore, incubation of racemic 5(R,S)-HpETE (1 μm) resulted in an almost identical level of 5-oxo-ETE production (6.79 ± 0.61 ng/106 cells). However, the incubation of the human neutrophil with either 5(S)-HpETE or 5(R,S)-HpETE) did not lead to any significant biosynthesis of 5-oxo-ETE (0.13 ± 0.05 and 0.17 ± 0.04, respectively). These results suggested that a hydroperoxide may be required for biosynthesis of 5-oxo-ETE, but did not unambiguously define the conversion of the 5-HpETE directly into 5-oxo-ETE. An alternative possibility would be a dual role for the hydroperoxide to stimulate a secondary biochemical pathway, adding a co-factor, which could then activate the biosynthetic pathway of 5-HETE to 5-oxo-ETE in a manner quite analogous to that previously described for the NADPH oxidase pathway in neutrophils. To investigate whether or not other hydroperoxides coincubated with 5(S)-HETE could stimulate 5-oxo-ETE formation from the hydroxyeicosanoid, cells were incubated with 15(S)-HpETE or 13(S)-HpODE (1 μm each) in the presence of 5(S)-HETE (1 μm) at 37 °C for 30 min. Neither hydroperoxide caused a significant enhancement of the production of 5-oxo-ETE (Fig.3) in the LC/MS/MS analysis. The specific transition for 5-oxo-ETE (m/z 317 → 203) indicated the elution of 5-oxo-ETE for which there was only a small quantity observed at this retention time. Additional experiments were carried out by incubating 5(S)-HpETE (1 μm) in the presence of d 8-5(S)-HETE (2 μm) to assess whether or not there was any direct precursor role for 5-HpETE. In this experiment the formation of 5-oxo-ETE from the d 8-5(S)-HETE would be revealed by a product eluting at the expected retention time at 27.5 min only having a molecular anion at m/z 324 (d 7-product). Collision-induced decomposition of this molecular anion would result in a product ion atm/z 210 and this transition could be used to detect the formation of any d 7-5-oxo-ETE fromd 8-5-HETE. In this experiment there was a robust formation of unlabeled 5-oxo-ETE as indicated by the component eluting at 27.5 min, having the transition m/z 317 → 203 for unlabeled 5-oxo-ETE, and yet very little conversion ofd 8-5-HETE intod 7-5-oxo-ETE (Fig.4). These studies further supported a direct conversion of 5-HpETE into 5-oxo-ETE without intermediate formation of 5-HETE.Figure 4Mass spectrometric analysis by multiple reaction monitoring of supernatants from peritoneal macrophages incubated withd 8-5(S)-HETE and 5(S)-HpETE.

Each of these subcellular fractions were incubated with 5(S)-HpETE (1 μm) for 10 min at 37 °C. The biosynthetic activity for 5-oxo-ETE was found predominantly within the cytosolic fractions (Table I) with 17.2 ± 14 and 6.5 ± 0.5 pmol/106 cells of 5-oxo-ETE formed in the cytosolic and microsomal fractions, respectively. Various cofactors were also added to each of these subcellular fractions, including NADP+, NADPH, and NADH (each at 1 mm) to examine whether or not they had any effect on 5-oxo-ETE biosynthesis from either 5(S)-HpETE or 5(S)-HETE (1 μm). After pretreatment of each of the subcellular fractions with the cofactors for 5 min at 37 °C, the production of 5-oxo-ETE was assessed by LC/MS/MS. There was no significant increase in 5-oxo-ETE biosynthesis when NADP+and NADH were added; however, there was a significant decrease in 5-oxo-ETE production (p < 0.01) when NADPH was added. The production of 5-oxo-ETE was 10–15 times higher when 5-HpETE was used as substrate relative to 5-HETE (Table II).Table I5-Oxo-ETE synthesis by intact cells and subcellular fractions from murine macrophagesFraction5-Oxo-ETEpmol/10 6 cellsIntact cells20.4 ± 1.8Cytosol17.2 ± 1.4Microsomal fraction6.5 ± 0.5Macrophages (5 × 106/ml cells) and aliquots (1 ml) of cytosolic and microsomal fractions (equivalent to 5 × 106cells/ml) were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with 5(S)-HpETE (1 μm, final concentration).

Mean ± S.E. are from four different cell preparations with each sample run in duplicate. The process involved in the conversion of 5(S)-HpETE into 5-oxo-ETE was found not to be greatly altered by boiling for 20 min, because the rate of 5-oxo-ETE production dropped only 20% after heating. Furthermore, this treatment caused the formation of substantial denatured proteins observed as an abundant precipitate that had no biochemical activity (data not shown). Incubation of racemic 5-HpETE with the cytosolic fraction prepared from separate macrophages was found to yield substantial 5-oxo-ETE (16.2 ± 2.2 pmol/106 macrophages), virtually identical to that observed when the same preparation of macrophage cytosol was incubated with the same concentration of 5(S)-HpETE (17.2 ± 1.4 pmol/106macrophages) (Table II). Thus, the cytosolic fraction displayed the same lack of stereospecificity observed with intact cell incubations in the formation of 5-oxo-ETE. The cytosolic fraction also catalyzed conversion of 13-HpODE and 15-HpETE into their respective oxo-lipids, but to a reduced extent with 6.6 pmol/106 cells of 13-oxo-ODE and 6.0 pmol/106 cells of 15-oxo-ETE under conditions identical to those used for Table I. The effect of 5-HpETE substrate concentration on the total rate of 5-oxo-ETE revealed saturation behavior with approximateV max of 92.2 pmol/mg of protein/min and apparentK m of 5.3 μm 5-HpETE (Fig.5 B). Furthermore, the formation of 5-oxo-ETE from 5-HpETE was relatively rapid and incubations longer than 10 min led to a diminution of the quantity of 5-oxo-ETE present in these cells. Because it is known that 5-oxo-ETE can be rapidly metabolized to several metabolites, including a glutathione adduct termed FOG7, it is likely that metabolic reactions decreased the apparent level of 5-oxo-ETE at these longer incubation times (Fig. 5 A). An evaluation of the molecular size of the factor present in the cytosol responsible for the conversion of 5-HpETE into 5-oxo-ETE was evaluated using size exclusion chromatography. Aliquots (10 μl) of macrophage cytosol and boiled cytosol (20 min) were injected onto an HPLC size exclusion chromatographic column and 1-min fractions collected for 14 min. Fractions were then tested for the presence of substances that would catalyze the conversion of 5-HpETE to 5-oxo-ETE under the standard conditions of 1 μm substrate concentration for 10 min at 37 °C. Only fractions eluting at 7 and 8 min had the capacity to convert 5-HpETE to 5-oxo-ETE (Fig. 6). Calibration of the HPLC size exc"

(1995) Biochemistry34, 2130–2136) that atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) stabilizes a dimeric form of the natriuretic peptide receptor A (NPRA) by simultaneously interacting with both receptor subunits. However, the first crystallographic study of unliganded NPRA extracellular domain documented a V-shaped dimer involving a membrane-proximal dimer interface and separate binding sites for ANP on each monomer. We explored the possibility of an alternative A-shaped dimer involving a membrane-distal dimer interface by substituting an unpaired solvent-exposed cysteine for Trp74 in the amino-terminal lobe of full-length NPRA. The predicted spacing between Trp74 from both subunits drastically differs, depending on whether the V-shaped (84 Å) or the A-shaped (8 Å) dimer model is considered. In contrast with the expected results for the reported V-shaped dimer, the NPRAW74C mutant was constitutively covalently dimeric. Also, the subunits spontaneously reassociated following transient disulfide reduction by dithiothreitol and reoxidation. However, ANP could neither bind to nor activate NPRAW74C. Permanent disulfide opening by reduction with dithiothreitol and alkylation with N-ethylmaleimide rescued ANP binding to NPRAW74C. The NPRA mutant could be maintained as a covalent dimer while preserving its function by crosslinking with the bifunctional alkylating agent phenylenedimaleimides (PDM), the ortho-substituted oPDM being more efficient than mPDM or pPDM. These results indicate that the membrane-distal lobe of the NPRAM extracellular domains are dynamically interfacing in the unliganded state and that ANP binding stabilizes the receptor dimer with more stringent spacing at the dimer interface.

Yamazaki T. Yazaki Y. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 51: 489-494Google Scholar). Natriuretic peptides counterbalance the renin-angiotensin system by lowering blood pressure and increasing natriuresis and diuresis. This role is exemplified in knockout mice with abrogated or reduced expression of ANP or its receptor NPRA and who are hypertensive (2John S.W. Krege J.H. Oliver P.M. Hagaman J.R. Hodgin J.B.

Chem. 2001; 276: 6057-6060Google Scholar). These receptors are composed of five domains. The glycosylated extracellular domain is required for binding the activating agents, e.g. natriuretic peptides, guanylin, and the sea urchin sperm-activating peptides (4Potter L.R. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6057-6060Google Scholar, 5Lucas K.A. Pitari G.M. Kazerounian S. Ruiz-Stewart I. Park J. Schulz S. Chepenik K.P. Waldman S.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 375-414Google Scholar, 6Garbers D.L. Methods. 1999; 19: 477-484Google Scholar). It is linked through a single transmembrane domain to the intracellular portion, which is composed of three domains. First a membrane-proximal domain, which is homologous to a protein kinase domain and presumably binds ATP but lacks catalytic function. This phosphorylated domain serves as a regulatory component for signal transduction (4Potter L.R. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6057-6060Google Scholar, 7Chinkers M. Garbers D.L. Science. 1989; 245: 1392-1394Google Scholar, 8Duda T. Goraczniak R. Surgucheva I. Rudnicka-Nawrot M. Gorczyca W.A. Palczewski K. Sitaramayya A. Baehr W. Sharma R.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8478-8482Google Scholar). It is also a target for the intracellular guanylyl cyclase activating protein (GCAP), which directly activates retinal and olfactory guanylyl cyclases (9Laura R.P. Hurley J.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11264-11271Google Scholar). The kinase homology domain (KHD) is connected through a coiled-coil (10Wilson E.M. Chinkers M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4696-4701Google Scholar, 11Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13414-13419Google Scholar) to the guanylyl cyclase domain, effecting the activation process by producing cyclic GMP (11Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13414-13419Google Scholar). Initial studies have shown that natriuretic peptide receptors could be documented as constitutively noncovalently dimeric through the interaction of both the extracellular (13Chinkers M. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18589-19597Google Scholar) and intracellular domains (10Wilson E.M. Chinkers M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4696-4701Google Scholar). Photoaffinity derivatives of ANP, with photosensitive substitutions at both ends of the peptide, could specifically crosslink the receptor dimer, indicating that the peptide must be interacting with both subunits (14Rondeau J.-J. McNicoll N. Gagnon J. Bouchard N. Ong H. De Léan A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2130-2136Google Scholar). Receptor dimerization is essential for the activation of the catalytic domain of retinal guanylyl cyclase, because both GTP substrates must interact with each subunit (12Ramamurthy V. Tucker C. Wilkie S.E. Daggett V. Hunt D.M. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26218-26229Google Scholar). In that model system, the coiled-coil connecting the intracellular domains appears to maintain apart both guanylyl cyclase moieties in the basal state. Activation then appears to involve the release of the constraint imposed by the coiled-coil on the catalytic domain (12Ramamurthy V. Tucker C. Wilkie S.E. Daggett V. Hunt D.M. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26218-26229Google Scholar). The membrane-proximal kinase homology domain is also a determinant in signal transduction. In the absence of ANP, the KHD domain maintains the receptor in the basal state (7Chinkers M. Garbers D.L. Science. 1989; 245: 1392-1394Google Scholar). The incoming activation stimulus appears to favor ATP binding and relieve this tonic inhibition through a concerted transmembrane allosteric change, resulting in activation of the catalytic moiety (15Foster D.C. Wedel B.J. Robinson S.W. Garbers D.L. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 135: 1-39Google Scholar). The initial activation step of NPRA is likely to involve a conformational change in the extracellular juxtamembrane region. Indeed, it has been reported that ANP activation leads to increased protease sensitivity of the juxtamembrane region (16Huo X. Abe T. Misono K.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16941-16951Google Scholar, 17Liu B. Meloche S. McNicoll N. Lord C. De Léan A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5599-5605Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of C423S located in the juxtamembrane region leads both to constitutive activation and receptor covalent dimerization through the exposed and unpaired Cys432 (18Labrecque J. McNicoll N. Marquis M. De Léan A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9752-9759Google Scholar). This activation was attributed by Misono et al. (16Huo X. Abe T. Misono K.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16941-16951Google Scholar) to the conformational change occurring in the juxtamembrane region more than to the covalent dimerization process, because a double mutation, C423S/C432S, was shown to be also constitutively active but not covalently dimeric (16Huo X. Abe T. Misono K.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16941-16951Google Scholar). Although this interpretation is viable, the occurrence of a constitutive disulfide bridge still indicates the proximity of the extracellular juxtamembrane region of the receptor subunits. The contribution of the extracellular juxtamembrane region in mediating ANP-induced activation is also well documented in a D435C mutant exposing a free cysteine three residues further toward the transmembrane region (19Labrecque J. Deschênes J. McNicoll N. De Léan A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8064-8072Google Scholar). This mutant is not covalently dimeric in the basal state, but ANP induces disulfide bridge formation through Cys435 upon receptor activation. When the extracellular domain of NPRA is expressed in truncated soluble form, it behaves in solution as a monomer (20Misono K.S. Sivasubramanian N. Berkner K. Zhang X. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 516-523Google Scholar). Agonist binding to the soluble extracellular domain induces noncovalent dimerization (20Misono K.S. Sivasubramanian N. Berkner K. Zhang X. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 516-523Google Scholar). Misono et al. proposed that ANP is binding to the soluble receptor dimer according to a 2:2 stoichiometric ratio (20Misono K.S. Sivasubramanian N. Berkner K. Zhang X. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 516-523Google Scholar). Their results, however, clearly document that at the midpoint of the dimerization process 1 μm ANP can dimerize a 2 μm receptor subunit, implying a 1:2 stoichiometric ratio. This 1:2 ratio is more in agreement with the ratio that we previously documented in full-length receptor by comparing ANP binding capacity with immunoassayable receptor subunit density (14Rondeau J.-J. McNicoll N. Gagnon J. Bouchard N. Ong H. De Léan A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2130-2136Google Scholar). The NPRA receptor extracellular domain has been crystallized in the unbound form by van den Akker et al., showing that it is composed of a homodimer (21van den Akker F. Zhang X. Miyagi M. Huo X. Misono K.S. Yee V.C. Nature. 2000; 406: 101-104Google Scholar). Each subunit displays a typical bilobed periplasmic protein folding and contains a chloride ion. In this initial report, the receptor structure was presented as a V-shaped dimer with a subunit interface located in the membrane-proximal lobe (Fig. 1). Prediction of the localization of the ANP binding region on this receptor was helped by our previous photoaffinity tagging results (22McNicoll N. Gagnon J. Rondeau J.-J. Ong H. De Léan A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12950-12956Google Scholar) and was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis (21van den Akker F. Zhang X. Miyagi M. Huo X. Misono K.S. Yee V.C. Nature. 2000; 406: 101-104Google Scholar). However the predicted localization of the ANP binding site in the V-shaped dimer was more on the lateral face of each receptor subunit in a position not easily amenable to simultaneous contact of the peptide with both receptor subunits or to any conformational change in the receptor (21van den Akker F. Zhang X. Miyagi M. Huo X. Misono K.S. Yee V.C. Nature. 2000; 406: 101-104Google Scholar). A more recent report on the structure of the CNP-bound NPRC receptor, which is devoid of guanylyl cyclase and mainly serves for peptide clearance, indicated an A-shaped dimeric structure with the dimerization interface in the membrane-distal lobe (23He X.-L. Chow D.-C. Martick M.M. Garcia K.C. Science. 2001; 293: 1657-1662Google Scholar). In that receptor dimer structure a single CNP molecule is binding within the intersubunit cleft, therefore interfacing both receptor subunits (23He X.-L. Chow D.-C. Martick M.M. Garcia K.C. Science. 2001; 293: 1657-1662Google Scholar). The A-shaped dimer structure was also recognized by van den Akker (24van den Akker F. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 923-937Google Scholar) in the original crystal structure of NPRA (Fig.1). This dimer conformation would conform to the 1:2 stoichiometric ratio of peptide to receptor subunit and provide, if applicable to the natriuretic peptide A receptor, a more conceivable mechanism for ANP high affinity binding and receptor dimer activation. In attempting to explore the various conformations of the NPRA dimer we noticed that the Trp74 residues located in the membrane-distal lobe of the receptor were separated by drastically different α-carbon distances in the V-dimer and the A-dimer conformations (82 Å versus 8 Å, Fig. 1). The position of Trp74 in NPRA is analogous to that of a cysteine involved in disulfide bridging of the eel NPRC dimer (25Takashima A. Katafuchi T. Shibasaki M. Kashiwagi M. Hagiwara H. Takei Y. Hirose S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 673-680Google Scholar). We thus explored the ability of a W74C mutant of rat NPRA to form a covalent dimer through either a disulfide bridge or longer spacers provided with bifunctional dimaleimide derivatives. The results indicate that the W74C mutant is constitutively covalently dimeric, confirming the A-shaped dimer and excluding the V-shaped dimer conformation. But the disulfide-bridged dimeric mutant is inactive. However, proper binding of ANP and receptor activation can be achieved by maintaining a slightly wider spacing between residues 74 using bifunctional cross-linkers. Reciprocally, ANP binding hinders disulfide bridge formation in the W74C mutant. Thus, the ANP-bound and activated receptor dimer appears to adopt a more stable conformation than in the unbound state. These results contribute to the understanding of the conformational changes occurring early on during the activation of NPRA. A wild type (WT) rat NPRA clone inserted into pBK-CMV (Stratagene) between sites NheI and KpnI (26Marquis M. Fenrick R. Pedro L. Bouvier M. De Léan A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 194: 23-30Google Scholar) was used for generating the various mutants. NPRAW74C (Fig. 2) was obtained by mutating Trp74 into Cys according to a Clontech kit using the mutagenic primer 5′-GACCTCAAGTGTGAGCACAGCC-3′. The mutation was checked by sequencing, and the fragment encompassing the mutation was subcloned into NPRAWT. The ΔKCC423S,C432S and ΔKCC423S,C432S,W74C mutants (Fig. 2) were obtained starting from the deletion mutant ΔKCWT lacking all cytoplasmic domain (19Labrecque J. Deschênes J. McNicoll N. De Léan A.

The mutation was checked by sequencing, and the fragment between sites EcoRI and KpnI was subcloned into NPRAWT and NPRAW74C to generate mutants ΔKCC423S,C432S and ΔKCC423S,C432S,W74C, respectively. HEK293 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units of penicillin/streptomycin in a 5% CO2incubator at 37 °C. Transfection assays were carried out in 100-mm plates (1.2 × 106 cells) using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation technique as described previously (27Lia F. Rajotte D. Clark S.C. Hoang T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28287-28293Google Scholar). Cells were replated 48 h post transfection in 24-well cluster plates at 105 cells per well and incubated 24 h prior to agonist stimulation. The cells were washed twice with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated at 37 °C in quadruplicate wells with varying concentrations of rANP (Peninsula) in the same medium containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.5 mm1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine. After a 1-h incubation, the medium was collected, and extracellular cyclic GMP was measured in duplicate by radioimmunoassay as described previously (28Féthière J. Meloche S. Nguyen T.T. Ong H. De Léan A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 584-592Google Scholar). Membrane preparations of transfected HEK293 were done according to Labrecque et al.(18Labrecque J. McNicoll N. Marquis M. De Léan A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9752-9759Google Scholar). Essentially, cells were harvested 72 h post transfection and homogenized in ice-cold buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 μm aprotinin, 1 μmleupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 10 μm pefabloc, and 1 mm EDTA). After centrifugation at 40,000 ×g for 30 min, the pellets were washed twice and finally resuspended in freezing buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, protease inhibitors, 1 mm MgCl2, and 250 mm sucrose. Membranes were then frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −80 °C until used. The protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Membranes (0.6 mg/ml) were treated with 5 mm of DTT (Sigma) in Tris-EDTA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm EDTA) at 22 °C for 50 min in darkness under an argon atmosphere. Tubes containing membranes were then cooled on ice and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Membranes were washed with Tris-EDTA buffer alone, and pellets were resuspended in the same buffer at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. For control, membranes were incubated as described above, except that DTT was omitted. Following the reduction step, membranes were treated with PDM (30Hashimoto M. Majima E. Goto S. Shinohara Y. Terada H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1050-1056Google Scholar) to covalently bridge the cysteine residues. Membrane proteins (100 μg) were incubated in darkness for 60 min at 4 °C with 0.1 mm oPDM, mPDM, or pPDM (Aldrich) in a final volume of 0.2 ml of Tris-EDTA buffer. Control was obtained with the monovalent maleimide compound NEM (Fisher) at 0.1 mm. At the end of incubation, 10 mm NEM was added to all tubes to block all free unreacted cysteine residues and prevent spurious disulfide formation, and incubation was continued for 10 min at 4 °C. Treated membranes were centrifuged, washed once, resuspended in freezing buffer, and kept at −80 °C. For reoxidation of cysteine pairs, the DTT-reduced membrane proteins were treated with CuSO4-orthophenanthroline (Cu(OP)2) (Fisher) according to Majima et al. (29Majima E. Ikawa K. Takeda M. Hashimoto M. Shinohara Y. Terada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29548-29554Google Scholar). Membranes at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml were incubated with or without 25 μm Cu(OP)2 for 10 min at 4 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of NEM and EDTA, both at 10 mm. After further incubation for 10 min at 4 °C, treated membranes were centrifuged, and the pellets were washed once in Tris-EDTA buffer. The final pellets were resuspended in freezing buffer and kept at −80 °C. When ANP was tested for its ability to interfere with the covalent receptor dimerization, 100 nmrANP was added at 4 °C 20 min prior to the treatment with Cu(OP)2. Membrane protein samples (4–10 μg) were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer (62 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.001% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8) without (non-reducing) or with (reducing) 5% β-mercaptoethanol and heated at 100 °C for 3 min. Electrophoresis was performed in a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel for the ΔKC mutants and a 5% polyacrylamide gel for the full-length NPRA mutant. Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) using the liquid Mini Trans-Blot system (Bio-Rad). Detection of receptor was achieved using an affinity-purified antibody from a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against the carboxyl terminus sequence of NPRA (18Labrecque J. McNicoll N. Marquis M. De Léan A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9752-9759Google Scholar). Specific signals were probed with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled second antibody according to the ECL Western blotting analysis system (Amersham Biosciences). 125I-rANP was prepared using the lactoperoxidase method as described previously (18Labrecque J. McNicoll N. Marquis M. De Léan A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9752-9759Google Scholar). The specific activity of the high pressure liquid chromatography-purified radioligand was at least 2000 Ci/mmol. Membranes from HEK293 expressing rat NPRAWT, NPRAW74C, ΔKCC423S,C432S, or ΔKCC423S,C432S,W74C (0.2–1.0 μg) were incubated in duplicate with 10 fmol of 125I-rANP for 20 h at 4 °C in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA and 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Nonspecific binding was defined by the addition of non-radioactive rANP at 100 nm. Bound ligand was separated from free ligand by filtration on GF/C filters pretreated with 1% polyethylenimine. Filters were washed 4 times and counted in an LKB gamma counter. Dose-response curves were analyzed with the program AllFit for Windows based on the four-parameter logistic equation (31De Léan A. Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: E97-E102Google Scholar). The two proposed arrangements of the NPRA extracellular domain as a V-shaped and an A-shaped dimer mainly differ in terms of the localization of the dimer interface in the membrane-proximal and the membrane-distal lobes of the receptor subunits (Fig. 1). The surface-exposed residues Trp74 are also widely spaced in the V-dimer (82 Å), whereas these residues are juxtaposed (8 Å) at the membrane-distal end of the dimer interface in the A-shaped dimer. Therefore, substitution of Trp74 with Cys should yield a disulfide-bridged dimer only in the case of the A-shaped dimer conformation. When the full-length NPRAW74C mutant transiently expressed in HEK293 cells is studied in SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions, we observe that the mutant is present almost exclusively as a dimer (Fig. 3,right panel). This dimer can be reduced by treatment with DTT followed by alkylation of free sulfydryls with NEM (Fig. 3, right panel). However, if the receptor mutant is reoxidized in the presence of Cu(OP)2 following reduction with DTT, then the receptor mutant reassociates as a disulfide-bridged dimer (Fig. 3, right panel). Thus, the disulfide bridge between the two exposed Cys74 residues is constitutive and is formed spontaneously when reducing conditions are replaced by mild oxidizing conditions. Therefore, residues 74 from both receptor subunits should be spontaneously adjacent, in accordance with the A-shaped conformation and in drastic contrast with the prediction of the V-shaped dimer originally proposed (Fig. 1). In addition, the disulfide bridge, which is likely to occur early on during biosynthesis of the NPRAW74C mutant, does not appear to result from an imposed constraint, because it can be formed again following reduction of the mature and unstimulated receptor protein. Because the inter α-carbon distance (8 Å) of the two Trp74 residues is slightly longer than the expected distance for disulfides (5–7 Å), we wondered if bridging the two Cys74 might interfere with the high affinity binding and activation processes of ANP on NPRAW74C. Indeed the receptor mutant is almost completely devoid of high affinity for ANP in membrane preparations from HEK293 cells transiently expressing NPRAW74C (Fig. 4). The receptor mutant is also almost completely insensitive to ANP-activation with marginal response (Fig. 5). This loss of function is not due to an irreversible alteration by the mutation of receptor folding, because reduction and alkylation of the dimer leading to a monomer restores high affinity binding for ANP (Fig.4). Moreover, reoxidation of the Cys74 disulfide following reduction leads again to the loss of high affinity binding for ANP (Fig. 4). Thus, although Cys74 disulfide bridge formation is spontaneous for the basal state of the receptor, this tight dimer conformation prevents ANP high affinity binding and functional activation. These results suggest that, unlike the case for the basal state of the receptor, the ANP-bound and active state requires more stringent proximity conditions, which the Cys74 disulfide prevents by slightly constraining the inter α-carbon distance of residues 74 to <8 Å.Figure 5Cyclic GMP production is blunted in NPRAW74C mutant. Dose-response curves of ANP on cGMP production was performed on HEK293 cells transiently transfected with NPRAWT (closed circles) or NPRAW74C(open circles), and extracellular cyclic GMP was assayed by radioimmunoassay. Each data point represents the mean ± S.E. of four determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To verify that proper spacing of residues 74 from both receptor subunits is required for the active state, we looked for various types of bifunctional cross-linking agents specific for surface-exposed sulfydryls. Such agents had to be reacting with Cys74 following the disulfide bridge opening with DTT. Initial attempts to use dual methane thiosulfonate reagents (MTS reagents; Toronto Research Company) were fraught with difficulties. We observed that preliminary reduction with DTT left other free and reactive cysteines besides Cys74. Thus, although MTS compounds could properly cross-link free Cys74, additional spurious disulfide formation occurred, resulting in multiple receptor oligomers. Also, because MTS compounds form a reducible covalent link with cysteines, SDS-PAGE could not be performed under reducing conditions, precluding elimination of spurious disulfides. We thus resorted to dimaleimide cross-linking reagents, which have been used for sizing inter-cysteine distances in proteins (30Hashimoto M. Majima E. Goto S. Shinohara Y. Terada H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1050-1056Google Scholar). oPDM, mPDM, and pPDM can efficiently cross-link neighboring exposed cysteines, and the resulting dimers can be studied in SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions with the advantage of removing spurious disulfides. In addition, the number of potential free and exposed cysteines was reduced by truncating the cytoplasmic domain of NPRA with many potentially exposed free cysteines and by mutating both Cys423 and Cys432, which are exposed in the juxtamembrane region, leaving only two buried and unreactive disulfides (Fig. 2). Thus for the ΔKCC423S,C432S,W74C mutant, the additional W74C mutation could provide the only exposed free cysteine, avoiding spurious cysteine reactions. Following transient reduction with DTT, the ΔKCC423S,C432S,W74C mutant was efficiently crosslinked as a non-reducible dimer by oPDM and mPDM and somewhat less by pPDM (Fig.6, right panel). The untreated disulfide-bridged ΔKCC423S,C432S,W74C mutant was devoid of high affinity ANP binding (Fig. 7). As for the full-length NPRAW74C mutant, reduction and alkylation of ΔKCC423S,C432S,W74C with DTT and NEM could restore ANP binding by cleaving the interchain disulfide (Fig. 7). However crosslinking of the receptor subunits with oPDM completely restored ANP binding (Fig. 7) while maintaining a covalent dimer with a wider spacing of the Cys74 from both subunits than was obtained with the disulfide (Fig. 6). mPDM and pPDM were much less effective, presumably because the inter Cys74 spacing imposed by those cross-linking agents was too wide, therefore interfering with optimal positioning of the two subunits at the dimer interface. ANP binding measurements of the cross-linked receptor indicated that those differences were not due to reduction in binding capacity but in binding affinity (data not shown), suggesting that suboptimal spacing of the receptor subunits perturbed the binding interaction of ANP in the binding cleft.Figure 7Cross-linking of Cys74 with PDM preserves ANP binding to ΔKCC423S,C432S,W74C. Membranes from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with ΔKCC423S,C432Scontrol (open bars) and ΔKCC423S,C432S,W74Cmutant (hatched bars) following alkylation with PDM as described in the Fig. 6 legend. The membranes (0.2 μg) were then incubated with 10 pm125I-ANP with or without an excess of unlabeled ANP for 20 h at 4 °C. Specific binding is expressed as mean ± S.E. of duplicate determinations. This figure is representative of two identical experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because disulfide bridging of W74C mutants leads to a slightly constrained inactive dimer, presumably because the dimer conformation does not satisfy the more stringent interface spacing required for high affinity ANP binding, we wondered whether, in reciprocal fashion, ANP binding to the ΔKCC423S,C432S,W74C mutant could prevent Cys74 disulfide formation. The receptor mutant was first reduced with DTT (Fig. 8) and then incubated with saturating concentrations of ANP before attempting to reoxidize the Cys74 disulfide in the presence of Cu(OP)2. When studied with SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions, the truncated W74C mutant was spontaneously dimeric (Fig, 8, right panel). In analogy with the full-length receptor (Fig. 4), this truncated mutant was also devoid of high affinity for ANP (Fig. 9), but peptide binding could be restored by reduction and alkylation. Incubation with ANP inhibited dimer formation following transient reduction with DTT (Fig. 8,right panel). Thus, unlike the basal inactive state of the NPRA receptor, which allows for spontaneous Cys74 disulfide formation due, presumably, to conformational flexibility and mobility at the dimer interface, the ANP-bound and activated state displays more stringent interface positioning requirements, probably because ANP binding stabilizes the receptor dimer and thus reduces the conformational mobility of the subunits interface.Figure 9Re-oxidation of Cys74ΔKCC423S,C432S,W74Cinhibits ANP binding. ANP binding was measured in ΔKCC423S,C432Scontrol (open bars) and ΔKCC423S,C432S,W74Cmutant (hatched bars) after reduction with DTT and re-oxidation of Cys74 disulfide as described in the Fig. 8legend. The membranes (0.5 μg) were then incubated with 10 pm125I-ANP with or without an excess of unlabeled ANP for 20 h at 4 °C. Specific binding is expressed as mean ± S.E. of duplicate determinations. The experiment was repeated twice with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We have provided documentation that the extracellular domain of the natriuretic peptide receptor adopts an A-shaped dimer conformation with a membrane-distal dimer interface. All experiments were based on a membrane-anchored receptor, therefore ensuring that the conclusions would be representative of native cellular NPRA. The results do not confirm the initial V-shaped dimer conformation proposed for the unbound state of NPRA. According to that originally proposed conformation, the membrane proximal lobes would provide the dimer interface. In addition, the V-shaped conformation would allow for one ANP binding surface located on each side of the dimer, therefore resulting in a 2:2 stoichiometric ratio for ANP binding to NPRA (21van den Akker F. Zhang X. Miyagi M. Huo X. Misono K.S. Yee V.C. Nature. 2000; 406: 101-104Google Scholar). Although the membrane-proximal localization of the dimer interface is analogous to that for growth hormone receptor (32de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Google Scholar), it provides few hints about the activation process of NPRA, because the ANP molecules would preferentially, if not exclusively, interface with only one dimer subunit, in contrast with many cases documented to date for growth factor and cytokine receptors (32de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Google Scholar, 33Elkins P.A. Christinger H.W. Sandowski Y. Sakal E. Gertler A. de Vos A.M. Kossiakoff A.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 808-815Google Scholar, 34Syed R.S. Reid S.W. Li C. Cheetham J.C. Aoki K.H. Liu B. Zhan H. Osslund T.D. Chirino A.J. Zhang J. Finer-Moore J. Elliott S. Sitney K.B.A. Matthews D.J. Wendoloski J.J. Egrie J. Stroud R.M. Nature. 1998; 395: 511-516Google Scholar). The ANP-bound NPRA dimer is not likely to adopt the V-shaped conformation, because covalent cross-linking of the W74C mutant with oPDM preserves peptide binding and maintains the membrane-distal lobes in proximity, albeit more apart than with disulfide bridging but still considerably closer than what the V-dimer could accommodate. The A-shaped dimer conformation subsequently proposed by van den Akker (24van den Akker F. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 923-937Google Scholar) for NPRA and documented by Garcia and co-workers for NPRC (23He X.-L. Chow D.-C. Martick M.M. Garcia K.C. Science. 2001; 293: 1657-1662Google Scholar) is more similar to the conformation of other dimeric receptors,e.g. the glutamate metabotropic receptor (35Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Google Scholar). The constitutively dimeric properties of the native NPRAW74Cmutant strongly suggest that this A-shaped conformation is natural and potentially contributes to a loose dimer in the basal inactive state of the membrane-anchored receptor. However, as pointed out by van den Akker (24van den Akker F. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 923-937Google Scholar) the membrane-distal dimer interface area is probably insufficient to maintain by itself the A-dimer conformation, therefore explaining the monomeric state of the unbound extracellular domain in soluble truncated form (20Misono K.S. Sivasubramanian N. Berkner K. Zhang X. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 516-523Google Scholar). Indeed, ANP binding to an A-shaped NPRA dimer would be expected to significantly contribute to the surface of the dimer interface and therefore stabilize the dimer. This would explain the observation of ANP-induced dimerization of the extracellular domain (20Misono K.S. Sivasubramanian N. Berkner K. Zhang X. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 516-523Google Scholar) that would result from a huge increase of the dimerization constant induced by peptide binding. Although the data presented show that the unbound state of NPRA is characterized by greater flexibility and mobility at the dimer interface, which is required for allowing for Cys74disulfide formation, the ANP-bound and active state of NPRA displays more stringent intersubunit distance requirements that are incompatible with Cys74 disulfide formation but could be satisfied by proper spacing with oPDM. Thus, ANP binding is likely to stabilize the NPRA dimer, presumably by fitting within the inter subunit cleft below the dimer interface, therefore substantially contributing to the buried surfaces of the dimer interface and restraining its mobility. Reciprocally, binding of ANP within this cleft is likely to tightly retain the bound peptide, resulting in a high affinity and slow dissociation rate in agreement with reported observations. Thus, the monitoring of residues 74 at the membrane-distal end of the dimer interface is providing a very sensitive assessment of dimer positioning during receptor activation. Although these results fully support the A-shaped dimer conformation involving a dimer interface in the membrane distal lobe of the extracellular domain, they do not exclude the existence of another extracellular domain interface in the juxtamembrane domain. Indeed the CNP-bound NPRC dimer used by Garcia and co-workers for crystallography included an interchain disulfide in the juxtamembrane portion of the extracellular domain (23He X.-L. Chow D.-C. Martick M.M. Garcia K.C. Science. 2001; 293: 1657-1662Google Scholar). Also, the constitutive formation of a disulfide bridge at Cys432 in the NPRAC423Smutant and the observation of an agonist-induced disulfide bridge three residues further in the case of the NPRAD435C mutant both strongly suggest that the juxtamembrane region connecting the bi-lobed periplasmic folded domain with the transmembrane domain is involved in some additional dimer interface, possibly contributing to the signal transduction process from the extracellular to the intracellular domains of the receptor. Crystallographic documentation of the structure of the ANP-bound NPRA extracellular domain of the membrane-anchored receptor as well as the kinase homology domain should provide further insight into the signal transduction mechanism of membrane guanylyl cyclases and also contribute to better understanding of other single transmembrane domain receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2167229576,"CD38 is a progression marker in HIV-1 infection, it displays lateral association with CD4, and down-modulates gp120/CD4 binding. The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanism behind the interplay between CD4, CD38, and HIV-1. We used mouse cell transfectants expressing human CD4 and either CD38 or other CD4-associated molecules to show that CD38 specifically inhibits gp120/CD4 binding. Human cell transfectants expressing truncated forms of CD38 and bioinformatic analysis were used to map the anti-HIV activity and show that it is concentrated in the membrane-proximal region. This region displayed significant sequence-similarity with the V3 loop of the HIV-1 gp120 glycoprotein. In line with this similarity, synthetic soluble peptides derived from this region reproduced the anti-HIV effects of full-length CD38 and inhibited HIV-1 and HIV-2 primary isolates from different subtypes and with different coreceptor use. A multiple-branched peptide construct presenting part of the sequence of the V3-like region potently and selectively inhibited HIV-1 replication in the nanomolar range. Conversely, a deletion in the V3-like region abrogated the anti-HIV-1 activity of CD38 and its lateral association with CD4. These findings may provide new insights into the early events of HIV-1 fusion and strategies to intervene."
https://openalex.org/W2171353224,"An alpha-toxin responsible for nitric oxide (NO) release in rabbit corpus cavernosum (RbCC) was isolated from Tityus serrulatus venom (TSV). The isolated peptide (molecular mass of 7427.66+/-0.15 Da) was identified as Ts3 after determination of Cys residues, N-terminal amino acid analysis, and proteolytic peptide mapping. Ts3 (30 nM) markedly relaxed the RbCC; this response was blocked by the NO synthesis inhibitor N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (100 microM) and the Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin (100 nM). Synthetic peptides based on either Ts3 (P1-16, P17-32, P33-48, P49-64, P9-24, P25-40, P41-56, YGLPDKVPTKT) or Bukatoxin (isolated from Buthus martensi Karsch scorpion venom) sequence (Buka11, Buka11-B, PDKVP, PDSEP) were assayed. These peptides slightly relaxed the RbCC, and such an effect was independent of Na+ channel activation or NO release. Our results indicate that Ts3 exerts nitrergic actions and contributes to the relaxing activity of TSV in RbCC, thus providing a valuable tool to investigate the mechanisms underlying nerve activation in erectile tissues, because NO released from nitrergic fibers plays a key role in the erectile process. Our findings revealed the key importance of the Ts3 structure three-dimensional conformation maintenance for biological activity, because linear peptide sequences neither presented substantial relaxations nor was this effect related to nitrergic activity."
