We generated and characterized a new mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus that captures multiple aspects of severe COVID-19 disease in standard laboratory mice. This SARS-CoV-2 model exhibits the spectrum of morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 disease as well as aspects of host genetics, age, cellular tropisms, elevated Th1 cytokines, and loss of surfactant expression and pulmonary function linked to pathological features of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This model can rapidly access existing mouse resources to elucidate the role of host genetics, underlying molecular mechanisms governing SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, and the protective or pathogenic immune responses related to disease severity. The model promises to provide a robust platform for studies of ALI and ARDS to evaluate vaccine and antiviral drug performance, including in the most vulnerable populations (i.e., the aged) using standard laboratory mice."

Here we show that this inflammation is driven by the cytoplasmic DNA sensor cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)-AMP synthase (cGAS) when TDP-43 invades mitochondria and releases DNA via the permeability transition pore. Pharmacologic inhibition or genetic deletion of cGAS and its downstream signaling partner STING prevents upregulation of NF-κB and type I IFN induced by TDP-43 in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived motor neurons and in TDP-43 mutant mice. Finally, we document elevated levels of the specific cGAS signaling metabolite cGAMP in spinal cord samples from patients, which may be a biomarker of mtDNA release and cGAS/STING activation in ALS. Our results identify mtDNA release and cGAS/STING activation as critical determinants of TDP-43-associated pathology and demonstrate the potential for targeting this pathway in ALS.

TDP-43 is a nuclear DNA/RNA binding protein that is mutated in 4% of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Kabashi et al., 2008Kabashi E. Valdmanis P.N. Dion P. Spiegelman D. McConkey B.J.

Sampathu D.M. Kwong L.K. Truax A.C. Micsenyi M.C. Chou T.T. Bruce J. Schuck T. Grossman M. Clark C.M. et al.Ubiquitinated TDP-43 in frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Science. 2006; 314: 130-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (4107) Google Scholar). Aside from two RNA binding domains, TDP-43 also encodes a nuclear localization sequence and nuclear export sequence, which mediate shuttling between the nucleus and cytosol, and a low-complexity glycine-rich region, which is where missense mutations (e.g., A315T, Q331K, or M337V) have been found to cause ALS (Kabashi et al., 2008Kabashi E. Valdmanis P.N. Dion P. Spiegelman D. McConkey B.J. Vande Velde C. Bouchard J.P. Lacomblez L. Pochigaeva K.

The C-terminal glycine-rich domain encodes a prion-like structure that can potentiate cytoplasmic aggregation (Johnson et al., 2009Johnson B.S. Snead D. Lee J.J. McCaffery J.M. Shorter J. Gitler A.D.

Recent studies demonstrate that ALS-associated mutations enhance TDP-43 accumulation not only in the cytoplasm but specifically within mitochondria (Magrané et al., 2014Magrané J. Cortez C. Gan W.B.

Med. 2016; 22: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This appears to be a specific way in which mislocalized TDP-43 affects homeostasis of the cell and could have more far-reaching consequences for triggering immune response pathways. ALS, and TDP-43-mediated neurodegeneration in general, has been associated with not only hyperinflammatory responses, such as nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-related cytokines (Egawa et al., 2012Egawa N.

TDP-43 activates microglia through NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome.Exp.

Activation of interferon signaling pathways in spinal cord astrocytes from an ALS mouse model.Glia. 2011; 59: 946-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these inflammatory signals precede overt symptoms in mouse models of the disease, which suggests that they participate in disease pathogenesis rather than simply acting as a marker of disease. Indeed, blockade of NF-κB appears to have some ability to reduce denervation in the neuromuscular junction and improve motor symptoms in TDP-43 (A315T) transgenic mice (Swarup et al., 2011Swarup V. Phaneuf D. Dupré N. Petri S. Strong M. Kriz J. Julien J.P. Deregulation of TDP-43 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis triggers nuclear factor κB-mediated pathogenic pathways.J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208: 2429-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Despite these indications, there is currently no immune sensor proposed to detect cytoplasmic TDP-43 and trigger the inflammation observed in TDP-43 proteinopathies, laying the groundwork for this study. To examine inflammation triggered by TDP-43, we employed inducible expression of empty vector (control [Ctrl]), wild-type (WT), or ALS mutant (Q331K) TDP-43 in a mouse neuronal cell line, which confirmed upregulation of NF-κB and type I IFN pathways in vitro (Figures S1A–S1C). To identify the innate immune sensor regulating this response, we repeated the in vitro model in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) genetically deficient for a panel of candidates that are known to regulate NF-κB and type I IFN production (Figures 1A, S1D, and S1E). Because TDP-43 is an RNA binding protein, we first interrogated sensors of cytoplasmic RNA, including RIG-I and MDA-5 (via deletion of the conserved signaling adaptor MAVS) and PKR (Figure 1A). Surprisingly, absence of these innate immune sensors did not reduce NF-κB or type I IFN activation downstream of TDP-43 overexpression. Instead, deletion of cGAS, a sensor of cytoplasmic DNA, returned activation of these pathways to baseline (Figure 1A). cGAS signals via generation of a specific cyclic dinucleotide, cGAMP, which we could also detect in response to TDP-43 (Figure S1F). cGAMP then acts to trigger STING, which, as we confirmed using genetically deficient MEFs, also prevents TDP-43-induced inflammation (Figure 1A). We then made similar findings in human myeloid THP-1 cells, in which CRISPR-mediated deletion of STING led to significant attenuation of type I IFN and NF-κB pathways, as demonstrated by cytokine gene expression (Figure 1B) and activation of signaling molecules via western blot (Figure 1C). Next we looked to see whether pharmacological blockade of the pathway was feasible, using recently described inhibitors of cGAS (RU.521; Vincent et al., 2017Vincent J. Adura C. Gao P. Luz A. Lama L. Asano Y. Okamoto R. Imaeda T. Aida J. Rothamel K. et al.Small molecule inhibition of cGAS reduces interferon expression in primary macrophages from autoimmune mice.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 750Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and STING (H-151; Haag et al., 2018Haag S.M. Gulen M.F. Reymond L. Gibelin A. Abrami L. Decout A. Heymann M. van der Goot F.G. Turcatti G. Behrendt R. Ablasser A. Targeting STING with covalent small-molecule inhibitors.Nature. 2018; 559: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Indeed, these drugs prevented expression of IFNB1 and TNF in response to overexpressed WT and mutant TDP-43 (Figure 1D). We also confirmed activation of the cGAS/STING pathway in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived motor neurons (MNs) from ALS patients carrying familial mutations in TDP-43 (Figures 1E, 1F, and S1G–S1I). Finally, we quantified the levels of cGAMP in spinal cord samples from sporadic ALS patients and compared these with samples from cases of progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) as a neurological control (Figure 1G). This documented a significant increase in cGAMP for the ALS samples independent of age, sex, or post-mortem interval (Table S1). These results implicate cGAS as an important immune sensor regulating neuroinflammation associated with TDP-43 in ALS.Figure 1Inflammatory Signaling from TDP-43 Is Dependent on cGAS/STINGShow full caption(A) Vector alone (Ctrl) or plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged wild-type (WT) TDP-43 and the ALS mutation (Q331K) were transiently overexpressed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) genetically deficient for different innate immune sensors.

Ruiz P. Barber G.N. Intrinsic self-DNA triggers inflammatory disease dependent on STING.J. Immunol. 2014; 193: 4634-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To ascertain the source of DNA activating cGAS in response to TDP-43, we immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged cGAS from HEK293T cells overexpressing WT or ALS mutant TDP-43 (A315T or Q331K; Figure S2A), directly followed by qPCR for the detection of mitochondrial or nuclear DNA (White et al., 2014White M.J. McArthur K. Metcalf D. Lane R.M. Cambier J.C. Herold M.J. van Delft M.F. Bedoui S. Lessene G. Ritchie M.E. et al.Apoptotic caspases suppress mtDNA-induced STING-mediated type I IFN production.Cell. 2014; 159: 1549-1562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). This showed that, in response to TDP-43 overexpression, cGAS was bound to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) without evidence of the most abundant nuclear DNA sequences such as LINE1 elements or the ribosomal DNA RNA18S (Figure 2A). It is also possible to generate cell lines deficient for mtDNA (referred to as ρ0) by culturing them with low-dose ethidium bromide (EtBr) (Hashiguchi and Zhang-Akiyama, 2009Hashiguchi K. Zhang-Akiyama Q.M. Establishment of human cell lines lacking mitochondrial DNA.Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 554: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). mtDNA depletion from THP-1 cells containing inducible WT and mutant TDP-43 was achieved in culture with EtBr for 3 weeks, as judged by qPCR of mitochondrial gene expression (Figure S2B). We then treated the cells with doxycycline (Dox) to induce TDP-43 (WT or Q331K), followed by quantification of inflammatory cytokine expression (Figure 2B), and activation of signaling pathways downstream of cGAS/STING (Figure 2C), which returned to baseline in the ρ0 cells depleted of mtDNA. To ensure that EtBr treatment did not indirectly impair cGAS/STING signaling, we treated ρ0 cells with cGAS/STING ligands, for which responses were not reduced (Figures S2C and S2D). Of note, we also achieved significant mtDNA depletion in human iPSC-MNs over a shorter course of 10 days of EtBr treatment (Figure S2E), after which cytokine expression and IFN production were consistently decreased (Figures S2F and S2G). Taking an independent approach, we imaged cells and observed leakage of mtDNA into the cytoplasm in response to overexpression of WT TDP-43, which was further augmented in cells with the ALS-associated mutant TDP-43 (Figures 2D–2F; Video S1). Consistent with earlier reports regarding mtDNA stress (West et al., 2015West A.P. Khoury-Hanold W. Staron M. Tal M.C. Pineda C.M. Lang S.M. Bestwick M. Duguay B.A. Raimundo N. MacDuff D.A. et al.Mitochondrial DNA stress primes the antiviral innate immune response.Nature. 2015; 520: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), nucleoid size was increased because of TDP-43 (Figure S2H); however, TFAM levels appear normal, and mtDNA copy numbers were not increased (Figures S1I and S2I). Therefore, we identified mtDNA leakage into the cytosol as the trigger for cGAS/STING activation because of TDP-43 and next queried mechanisms for TDP-43 entry into and mtDNA release from mitochondria.Figure 2TDP-43 Causes mtDNA Release into the CytoplasmShow full caption(A) TDP-43-EGFP (WT or the ALS mutants A315T and Q331K) and FLAG-cGAS were transiently overexpressed in HEK293T cells, followed by extraction of DNA from FLAG immunoprecipitants.

Additionally, it has been reported that TDP-43 gains access to the mitochondrial matrix via the mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase TIM22 (Wang et al., 2016Wang W. Wang L. Lu J.

Med. 2016; 22: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We confirmed this and found that TDP-43 (WT or Q331K) did not release mtDNA in cells deficient for the TIM22 subunit AGK (Kang et al., 2017Kang Y. Stroud D.A. Baker M.J. De Souza D.P. Frazier A.E.

However, AGK has an additional function independent of the TIM22 translocase machinery, acting as a lipid kinase (Kang et al., 2017Kang Y. Stroud D.A. Baker M.J. De Souza D.P. Frazier A.E. Liem M.

To ensure that the effect of TIM22 deletion was not an indirect effect of deficient lipid kinase activity, cells were reconstituted with mutant AGK(G126E), which cannot phosphorylate lipids. Similar to WT AGK, this mutant AGK, which lacks lipid kinase activity, still promoted mitochondrial localization of TDP-43 and the release of mtDNA (Figures 3A–3D). TIM22 normally functions to import multi-pass transmembrane proteins, which TDP-43 is not; however, it does possess several stretches of hydrophobic amino acids that in part resemble transmembrane domains (Wang et al., 2016Wang W. Wang L. Lu J. Siedlak S.L. Fujioka H. Liang J. Jiang S. Ma X. Jiang Z. da Rocha E.L. et al.The inhibition of TDP-43 mitochondrial localization blocks its neuronal toxicity.Nat. Med. 2016; 22: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Some of these hydrophobic motifs have been identified to be critical for the mitochondrial import of TDP-43 and lead to development of competitive peptide inhibitors based on the motif itself, fused to a viral TAT peptide to facilitate delivery into the cell. These competitive peptide inhibitors prevent the mitochondrial import of TDP-43 (Wang et al., 2016Wang W. Wang L. Lu J. Siedlak S.L. Fujioka H. Liang J. Jiang S. Ma X. Jiang Z. da Rocha E.L. et al.The inhibition of TDP-43 mitochondrial localization blocks its neuronal toxicity.Nat. Med. 2016; 22: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and we show that these inhibitors also prevent subsequent leakage of mtDNA into the cytosol of ALS patient iPSC-derived motor neurons (Figures S3C and S3D). Furthermore, these inhibitors are reported to have therapeutic benefits in mouse models of ALS driven by TDP-43 (Wang et al., 2016Wang W. Wang L. Lu J. Siedlak S.L. Fujioka H. Liang J. Jiang S. Ma X. Jiang Z. da Rocha E.L. et al.The inhibition of TDP-43 mitochondrial localization blocks its neuronal toxicity.Nat.

As a comparison, we obtained iPSCs from ALS patients with repeat expansions in C9orf72 (C9-ALS), who are also known to develop TDP-43 pathology (DeJesus-Hernandez et al., 2011DeJesus-Hernandez M.

Liu et al. now show that the combination of a two-dimensional material with a photonic crystal can be used to develop an analogous quantum spin Hall system. The strong coupling between the monolayer tungsten disulfide excitons with a nontrivial hexagonal photonic crystal gives rise to helical topological polaritons observed at up to 200 kelvin. The topological polaritons can be actively tuned by temperature and may further be manipulated with electric or magnetic fields, thereby providing a flexible platform with which to explore exotic topological phenomena and new phases of quantum matter.

Habibi et al. exposed volunteers to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), one of the pathogens responsible for the common cold, and then followed them over the ensuing 2 weeks (see the Perspective by Mirchandani and Walmsley). The main factor distinguishing the infected from the noninfected was that the former showed signs of airway neutrophil activation before exposure to RSV. Conversely, protected individuals showed enhanced interleukin-17 signaling soon after virus inoculation. Similarly, mice pretreated with a neutrophil chemoattractant were more susceptible to RSV infection and CD8 + T cell–driven disease. Neutrophil proteases, which can modulate cytokine activity, may explain the disparity and could provide therapeutic targets for RSV and other respiratory infections.

https://openalex.org/W3092014111,"Antibodies against viral pathogens represent promising therapeutic agents for the control of infection, and their antiviral efficacy has been shown to require the coordinated function of both the Fab and Fc domains1. The Fc domain engages a wide spectrum of receptors on discrete cells of the immune system to trigger the clearance of viruses and subsequent killing of infected cells1–4. Here we report that Fc engineering of anti-influenza IgG monoclonal antibodies for selective binding to the activating Fcγ receptor FcγRIIa results in enhanced ability to prevent or treat lethal viral respiratory infection in mice, with increased maturation of dendritic cells and the induction of protective CD8+ T cell responses. These findings highlight the capacity for IgG antibodies to induce protective adaptive immunity to viral infection when they selectively activate a dendritic cell and T cell pathway, with important implications for the development of therapeutic antibodies with improved antiviral efficacy against viral respiratory pathogens. An antibody Fc domain variant with enhanced binding to an activating Fc receptor on dendritic cells promotes the induction of a protective CD8 T cell response."

Despite progress in characterizing and inhibiting these processes, in situ mechanistic and structural studies remain challenging. This is because these operations are executed by individual viral preintegration complexes deep within cells. We therefore reconstituted and imaged the early stages of HIV-1 replication in a cell-free system. HIV-1 cores released from permeabilized virions supported efficient, capsid-dependent endogenous reverse transcription to produce double-stranded DNA genomes, which sometimes looped out from ruptured capsid walls. Concerted integration of both viral DNA ends into a target plasmid then proceeded in a cell extract-dependent reaction. This reconstituted system uncovers the role of the capsid in templating replication."

Colon mucins additionally house and feed the gut microbiome. Here, we present an integrated structural analysis of the intestinal mucin MUC2. Our findings reveal the shared mechanism by which complex macromolecules responsible for blood clotting, mucociliary clearance, and the intestinal mucosal barrier form protective polymers and hydrogels. Specifically, cryo-electron microscopy and crystal structures show how disulfide-rich bridges and pH-tunable interfaces control successive assembly steps in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Remarkably, a densely O-glycosylated mucin domain performs an organizational role in MUC2. The mucin assembly mechanism and its adaptation for hemostasis provide the foundation for rational manipulation of barrier function and coagulation."

However, defendants often appear relatively insensitive to these changes in the severity of consequences. Fishbane et al. considered a different policy lever: improving the communication of information necessary to adhere to desired behavior (see the Perspective by Kohler-Hausmann). They found that redesigning a criminal summons form to highlight critical information and providing text message reminders increased the likelihood that defendants would show up to their appointed court date, thus eliminating a substantial percentage of arrest warrants for failing to appear in court. In follow-up experiments, the authors found that laypeople, but not experts, believe that such failures to appear are relatively intentional, and this belief reduces their support for interventions aimed at increasing awareness rather than punishment. These findings have implications for policies aimed at improving criminal justice outcomes. Science , this issue p. eabb6591 ; see also p. 658"

The use of cannabis and other exocannabinoids as anecdotal treatments for various GI disorders inspired the search for mechanisms by which these compounds mediate their effects, which led to the discovery of the mammalian endocannabinoid system. Dysregulated endocannabinoid signaling was linked to inflammation and the gut microbiota. However, the effects of endocannabinoids on host susceptibility to infection has not been explored. Here, we show that mice with elevated levels of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) are protected from enteric infection by Enterobacteriaceae pathogens. 2-AG directly modulates pathogen function by inhibiting virulence programs essential for successful infection. Furthermore, 2-AG antagonizes the bacterial receptor QseC, a histidine kinase encoded within the core Enterobacteriaceae genome that promotes the activation of pathogen-associated type three secretion systems. Taken together, our findings establish that endocannabinoids are directly sensed by bacteria and can modulate bacterial function."

Neural circuits mediating exploratory behavior should therefore integrate experience and use it to select the proper behavioral output. Using a spatial exploration assay, we uncovered an experience-dependent increase in momentary arrests in locations where animals arrested previously. Calcium imaging in freely exploring mice revealed a genetically and projection-defined neuronal ensemble in the basolateral amygdala that is active during self-paced behavioral arrests. This ensemble was recruited in an experience-dependent manner, and closed-loop optogenetic manipulation of these neurons revealed that they are sufficient and necessary to drive experience-dependent arrests during exploration. Projection-specific imaging and optogenetic experiments revealed that these arrests are effected by basolateral amygdala neurons projecting to the central amygdala, uncovering an amygdala circuit that mediates momentary arrests in familiar places but not avoidance or anxiety/fear-like behaviors."

Objective To evaluate COVID-19 impact on colorectal cancer services globally and identify predictors for behaviour change. Design An online survey of colorectal cancer service change globally in May and June 2020. Participants Attending or consultant surgeons involved in the care of patients with colorectal cancer. Main outcome measures Changes in the delivery of diagnostics (diagnostic endoscopy), imaging for staging, therapeutics and surgical technique in the management of colorectal cancer. Predictors of change included increased hospital bed stress, critical care bed stress, mortality and world region. Results 191 responses were included from surgeons in 159 centers across 46 countries, demonstrating widespread service reduction with global variation. Diagnostic endoscopy was reduced in 93% of responses, even with low hospital stress and mortality; whilst rising critical care bed stress triggered complete cessation (p = 0.02). Availability of CT and MRI fell by 40–41%, with MRI significantly reduced with high hospital stress. Neoadjuvant therapy use in rectal cancer changed in 48% of responses, where centers which had ceased surgery increased its use (62 vs 30%, p = 0.04) as did those with extended delays to surgery (p<0.001). High hospital and critical care bed stresses were associated with surgeons forming more stomas (p<0.04), using more experienced operators (p<0.003) and decreased laparoscopy use (critical care bed stress only, p<0.001). Patients were also more actively prioritized for resection, with increased importance of co-morbidities and ICU need. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with severe restrictions in the availability of colorectal cancer services on a global scale, with significant variation in behaviours which cannot be fully accounted for by hospital burden or mortality."

Conserved TQC mechanisms have been most intensively studied in yeast. ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of translocon-associated proteins (ERAD-T) is mediated by the ER-resident ubiquitin ligase Hrd1 (15Rubenstein E.M. Kreft S.G. Greenblatt W. Swanson R. Hochstrasser M. Aberrant substrate engagement of the ER translocon triggers degradation by the Hrd1 ubiquitin ligase.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 197 (22689655): 761-77310.1083/jcb.201203061Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Mammalian apolipoprotein B (the major protein component of low-density lipoproteins) is targeted for degradation by the Hrd1 homolog gp78 if its translocation arrests (17Fisher E.A. Khanna N.A. McLeod R.S. Ubiquitination regulates the assembly of VLDL in HepG2 cells and is the committing step of the apoB-100 ERAD pathway.J.

In ERAD of ribosome-associated proteins (ERAD-RA), the cytosolic ubiquitin ligase Ltn1/Rkr1 (listerin in mammals) promotes destruction of yeast proteins that simultaneously arrest in the ribosome and translocon (14Crowder J.J. Geigges M. Gibson R.T. Fults E.S. Buchanan B.W. Sachs N. Schink A. Kreft S.G. Rubenstein E.M. Rkr1/Ltn1 ubiquitin ligase-mediated degradation of translationally stalled endoplasmic reticulum proteins.J. Biol.

In vitro data indicate that ERAD-RA is conserved in mammalian systems (18von der Malsburg K. Shao S. Hegde R.S. The ribosome quality control pathway can access nascent polypeptides stalled at the Sec61 translocon.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2015; 26 (25877867): 2168-218010.1091/mbc.E15-01-0040Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In a third TQC mechanism, the ER-localized zinc metalloprotease Ste24 (ZMPSTE24 in mammals) promotes the degradation of proteins engineered to clog the translocon, likely via substrate cleavage (12Ast T. Michaelis S. Schuldiner M. The protease Ste24 clears clogged translocons.Cell. 2016; 164 (26771486): 103-11410.1016/j.cell.2015.11.053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The extent of overlap of TQC pathways in substrate selection is not known. We investigated the functional redundancy between Hrd1 and Ste24. We found that two model TQC substrates are targeted for destruction, to different extents, by both Hrd1 and Ste24. Cells lacking both enzymes exhibit a synthetic growth defect, consistent with overlapping function. This phenotype is rescued by two mutations that preferentially impair PTT and reduce the extent of aberrant engagement by a model TQC substrate. We speculate that many naturally occurring TQC substrates engage the translocon post-translationally. Perturbations that selectively impair PTT are likely to reduce the frequency of clogging and, consequently, the cellular dependence on enzymes required for translocon unclogging. Our results indicate that TQC is a robust system characterized by functional redundancy of Hrd1- and Ste24-mediated protein degradation. To investigate the relative contributions of Hrd1 and Ste24 to TQC, we generated yeast lacking genes encoding both enzymes. We compared the growth of WT, hrd1Δ, ste24Δ, and hrd1Δ ste24Δ yeast. Yeast individually lacking either HRD1 or STE24 grew comparably to WT cells (Fig. 1A). However, hrd1Δ ste24Δ yeast exhibited a profound growth defect, consistent with Hrd1 and Ste24 possessing redundant function. Similarly, yeast lacking STE24 and UBC7 (which encodes the primary ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that functions with Hrd1) grew more slowly than either ubc7Δ or ste24Δ yeast (Fig. 1B). We previously observed (and reproduce in Fig. 1C) that hrd1Δ ltn1Δ yeast grow similarly to WT yeast (14Crowder J.J. Geigges M. Gibson R.T. Fults E.S. Buchanan B.W. Sachs N. Schink A. Kreft S.G. Rubenstein E.M. Rkr1/Ltn1 ubiquitin ligase-mediated degradation of translationally stalled endoplasmic reticulum proteins.J. Biol.

We also generated yeast lacking LTN1 and STE24 and detected no genetic interaction. These results reveal a specific, negative genetic relationship between HRD1 and STE24. Roles for Hrd1 and Ste24 in TQC have been inferred by their ability to target unique model substrates engineered to aberrantly engage the translocon. Hrd1 substrates are incompletely stabilized in hrd1Δ yeast, suggesting parallel degradative mechanisms (19Engle S.M. Crowder J.J. Watts S.G. Indovina C.J. Coffey S.Z. Rubenstein E.M. Acetylation of N-terminus and two internal amino acids is dispensable for degradation of a protein that aberrantly engages the endoplasmic reticulum translocon.PeerJ. 2017; 5 (28848693): e372810.7717/peerj.3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). To query their specificity in TQC, we asked whether Hrd1 and Ste24 can target characterized substrates of the other enzyme. The prototypical Hrd1 ERAD-T substrate is Deg1*-Sec62 (Fig. 1D) (15Rubenstein E.M. Kreft S.G. Greenblatt W. Swanson R. Hochstrasser M. Aberrant substrate engagement of the ER translocon triggers degradation by the Hrd1 ubiquitin ligase.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 197 (22689655): 761-77310.1083/jcb.201203061Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Following co-translational insertion of Sec62 transmembrane segments, the cytosolic N-terminal tail loops into the translocon via PTT (15Rubenstein E.M. Kreft S.G. Greenblatt W. Swanson R. Hochstrasser M. Aberrant substrate engagement of the ER translocon triggers degradation by the Hrd1 ubiquitin ligase.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 197 (22689655): 761-77310.1083/jcb.201203061Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This engagement is stabilized by an adventitious disulfide bond between Sec62 and the interior of Sec61 (15Rubenstein E.M. Kreft S.G. Greenblatt W. Swanson R. Hochstrasser M. Aberrant substrate engagement of the ER translocon triggers degradation by the Hrd1 ubiquitin ligase.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 197 (22689655): 761-77310.1083/jcb.201203061Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 20Scott D.C. Schekman R.

Hrd1 targets Deg1*-Sec62 for degradation following this aberrant translocation (15Rubenstein E.M. Kreft S.G. Greenblatt W. Swanson R. Hochstrasser M. Aberrant substrate engagement of the ER translocon triggers degradation by the Hrd1 ubiquitin ligase.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 197 (22689655): 761-77310.1083/jcb.201203061Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We investigated the contributions of Hrd1 and Ste24 to Deg1*-Sec62 turnover. In WT cells, Deg1*-Sec62 exhibited characteristic post-translational modification and rapid degradation (Fig. 1, E and F) (15Rubenstein E.M. Kreft S.G. Greenblatt W. Swanson R. Hochstrasser M. Aberrant substrate engagement of the ER translocon triggers degradation by the Hrd1 ubiquitin ligase.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 197 (22689655): 761-77310.1083/jcb.201203061Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Loss of Hrd1 strongly but incompletely stabilized Deg1*-Sec62, consistent with the existence of redundant targeting mechanisms. Cells lacking only Ste24 degraded Deg1*-Sec62 with similar kinetics as WT cells. However, loss of STE24 in the context of HRD1 deletion modestly but significantly stabilized Deg1*-Sec62 more than deletion of HRD1 alone. This effect is partially obscured by the fact that STE24 deletion reduced Deg1*-Sec62 steady-state abundance (compare t = 0 for hrd1Δ and hrd1Δ ste24Δ). These results indicate that both Hrd1 and Ste24 contribute to Deg1*-Sec62 degradation, with Hrd1 having the more prominent role. We next determined whether Hrd1 promotes degradation of the model Ste24 substrate, Clogger (Fig. 1D). In Clogger, the ER-targeted soluble protein Pdi1 is fused to a rapidly folding version of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) (12Ast T. Michaelis S. Schuldiner M. The protease Ste24 clears clogged translocons.Cell. 2016; 164 (26771486): 103-11410.1016/j.cell.2015.11.053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). N-glycosylation sites are present upstream and downstream of the translocon-clogging DHFR moiety. The position of Clogger relative to the ER membrane (cytosolic, translocon-clogged, inserted) can be assessed based on differential migration by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1G). Species with the lowest mobility are fully glycosylated and have been completely inserted into the ER lumen. Species with the greatest mobility are nonglycosylated cytosolic molecules that have not engaged the translocon. Intermediate species represent hemiglycosylated, translocon-clogging proteins. We collectively refer to the combined Clogger population that is clogged or cytosolic as “preinserted.” At steady state, the relative proportion of preinserted Clogger was significantly increased in both ste24Δ and hrd1Δ cells compared with WT yeast (t = 0; Fig. 1, G and H). This was also observed in cells harboring attenuated proteasomes (Fig. S1, A and B) (12Ast T. Michaelis S. Schuldiner M. The protease Ste24 clears clogged translocons.Cell. 2016; 164 (26771486): 103-11410.1016/j.cell.2015.11.053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Further, loss of either Ste24 or Hrd1 partially but reproducibly stabilized total (Fig. 1I) and preinserted (Fig. 1J) Clogger populations. Loss of Ste24 had a greater impact on steady-state abundance of preinserted Clogger than HRD1 deletion. By contrast, HRD1 deletion had a stronger effect on turnover kinetics of both total and preinserted Clogger populations. Loss of Ste24 and Hrd1 had subtly different effects on the steady-state distribution of Clogger isoforms. Cells lacking Ste24 preferentially enriched cytosolic Clogger (Fig. 1G; quantified in Fig. S1C). ste24Δ and hrd1Δ cells both enriched the clogged form relative to WT cells. Further, the clogged:cytosolic ratio at steady state was greater in hrd1Δ than in ste24Δ cells (Fig. S1D). Simultaneous deletion of STE24 and HRD1 increased Clogger steady-state abundance relative to both single deletions (Fig. 1G). However, hrd1Δ ste24Δ cells did not additively or synergistically stabilize Clogger or increase the proportion of Clogger that was preinserted (Fig. 1, I and J). These observations indicate that Hrd1 and Ste24 both contribute to Clogger degradation, with Hrd1 having the more prominent role. We introduced a 13myc epitope tag to the C terminus of the essential Sec61 translocon pore subunit. This version of the translocon has been reported to be functional (21Carvalho P. Stanley A.M. Rapoport T.A. Retrotranslocation of a misfolded luminal ER protein by the ubiquitin-ligase Hrd1p.Cell. 2010; 143 (21074049): 579-59110.1016/j.cell.2010.10.028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Cells expressing sec61-13myc grew similarly to WT cells (Fig. 2A). Strikingly, this tag rescued the growth defect of hrd1Δ ste24Δ yeast. We analyzed the extent of aberrant translocon engagement by Deg1*-Sec62, which occurs via PTT (15Rubenstein E.M. Kreft S.G. Greenblatt W. Swanson R. Hochstrasser M. Aberrant substrate engagement of the ER translocon triggers degradation by the Hrd1 ubiquitin ligase.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 197 (22689655): 761-77310.1083/jcb.201203061Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), in cells expressing sec61-13myc. The N-terminal tail of the transmembrane protein Deg1*-Sec62 becomes glycosylated after it enters the translocon. A 13myc epitope on Sec61 reduced the extent of Deg1*-Sec62 glycosylation, consistent with reduced frequency of aberrant translocon engagement (Fig. 2, B and E). We investigated the impact of the Sec61 C-terminal 13myc epitope on translocation of model post- and co-translationally translocated proteins. Carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) enters the ER via PTT. CPY can be engineered to undergo CTT by replacing its signal sequence with that of co-translationally imported protein Ost1; the hybrid protein is termed OPY (14Crowder J.J. Geigges M. Gibson R.T.

Upon ER import, CPY and OPY become N-glycosylated and exhibit reduced electrophoretic mobility, as confirmed by endoglycosidase H (Endo H) sensitivity (Fig. 2E) (14Crowder J.J. Geigges M. Gibson R.T.

CPY, but not OPY, translocation, was partially impaired in cells expressing sec61-13myc (Fig. 2, C–E). Thus, C-terminal tagging of Sec61 with 13myc preferentially impairs PTT. We hypothesized that phenotypic rescue of hrd1Δ ste24Δ yeast by sec61-13myc is due to impaired PTT. We determined whether deletion of SEC72, which encodes a translocon component required for efficient PTT (8Harada Y. Li H. Wall J.S. Li H. Lennarz W.J. Structural studies and the assembly of the heptameric post-translational translocon complex.J. Biol.

Individual deletion of SEC72 had negligible impact on growth (Fig. 3A). However, like sec61-13myc, SEC72 deletion rescued the hrd1Δ ste24Δ synthetic phenotype. Further, PTT of Deg1*-Sec62 and CPY (but not CTT of OPY) was impaired in the absence of SEC72 (Figs. 2, C and D, and 3, B–D), although not to the same extent as by Sec61 tagging.

We determined whether hrd1Δ sec66Δ yeast also exhibit a synthetic phenotype. We generated yeast expressing or lacking all combinations of SEC66, HRD1, and DOA10 (an ER ubiquitin ligase with no characterized role in TQC (15Rubenstein E.M. Kreft S.G. Greenblatt W. Swanson R.

Individual or simultaneous deletion of HRD1 and DOA10 did not impact cell fitness, consistent with earlier results (31Swanson R. Locher M. Hochstrasser M. A conserved ubiquitin ligase of the nuclear envelope/endoplasmic reticulum that functions in both ER-associated and Matα2 repressor degradation.Genes Dev. 2001; 15 (11641273): 2660-267410.1101/gad.933301Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). hrd1Δ sec66Δ yeast (but not doa10Δ sec66Δ yeast) exhibited a modest synthetic negative growth phenotype that was exacerbated at an elevated temperature (Fig. 4B). By contrast, we observed no genetic interaction between HRD1 and SEC72 (Fig. 4C). Phenotypic similarity of hrd1Δ sec66Δ and ste24Δ sec66Δ yeast supports a model in which Hrd1 and Ste24 possess related translocon-linked function. Protein translocation is essential for life. WT levels of fitness of cells lacking individual TQC enzymes likely reflect a robust translocon surveillance infrastructure enabled by functional redundancy. Indeed, we found simultaneous loss of Ste24 and Hrd1 (or its ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc7) dramatically attenuates cell fitness. Consistent with our results, negative genetic interactions between UBC7 and STE24 have been detected in multiple large-scale analyses (25Costanzo M. Baryshnikova A. Bellay J. Kim Y. Spear E.D.

We describe each indicator and its relevance to the sharing economy as well as suggest measurable variables in the form of a practice-oriented tool. (5) Conclusions The framework and tool are the first holistic method for assessing social impact in the sharing economy, which may inform researchers, sharing platforms, regulators, investors, and citizens to mitigate adverse social impacts while enhancing the overall net social value of the sharing economy."
https://openalex.org/W3092605378,"Background Mendelian Randomization (MR) studies exploiting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) predictive of leukocyte telomere length (LTL) have suggested that shorter genetically determined telomere length (gTL) is associated with increased risks of degenerative diseases, including cardiovascular and Alzheimer’s diseases, while longer gTL is associated with increased cancer risks. These varying directions of disease risk have long begged the question: when it comes to telomeres, is it better to be long or short? We propose to operationalize and answer this question by considering the relative impact of long gTL vs. short gTL on disease incidence and burden in a population. Methods and findings We used odds ratios (OR) of disease associated with gTL from a recently published MR meta-analysis to approximate the relative contributions of gTL to the incidence and burden of neoplastic and non-neoplastic disease in a European population. We obtained incidence data of the 9 cancers associated with long gTL and 4 non-neoplastic diseases associated with short gTL from the Institute of Health Metrics (IHME). Incidence rates of individual cancers from SEER, a database of United States cancer records, were used to weight the ORs in order to align with the available IHME data. These data were used to estimate the excess incidences due to long vs. short gTL, expressed as per 100,000 persons per standard deviation (SD) change in gTL. To estimate the population disease burden, we used the Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) metric from the IHME, a measure of overall disease burden that accounts for both mortality and morbidity, and similarly calculated the excess DALY associated with long vs. short gTL. Results Our analysis shows that, despite the markedly larger ORs of neoplastic disease, the large incidence of degenerative diseases causes the excess incidence attributable to gTL to balance that of neoplastic diseases. Long gTL is associated with an excess incidence of 94.04 cases/100,000 persons/SD (45.49–168.84, 95%CI) from the 9 cancer, while short gTL is associated with an excess incidence of 121.49 cases/100,000 persons/SD (48.40–228.58, 95%CI) from the 4 non-neoplastic diseases. When considering disease burden using the DALY metric, long gTL is associated with an excess 1255.25 DALYs/100,000 persons/SD (662.71–2163.83, 95%CI) due to the 9 cancers, while short gTL is associated with an excess 1007.75 DALYs/100,000 persons/SD (411.63–1847.34, 95%CI) due to 4 non-neoplastic diseases. Conclusions Our results show that genetically determined long and short telomere length are associated with disease risk and burden of approximately equal magnitude. These results provide quantitative estimates of the relative impact of genetically-predicted short vs. long TL in a human population, and provide evidence in support of the cancer-aging paradox, wherein human telomere length is balanced by opposing evolutionary forces acting to minimize both neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases. Importantly, our results indicate that odds ratios alone can be misleading in different clinical scenarios, and disease risk should be assessed from both an individual and population level in order to draw appropriate conclusions about the risk factor’s role in human health."

We estimated the prevalence and factors associated with MiP and anemia in pregnancy (AiP) among asymptomatic women attending antenatal care (ANC) visits. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study among pregnant women attending ANC at Msambweni Hospital, between September 2018 and February 2019. Data was collected and analyzed in Epi Info 7. Descriptive statistics were calculated and we compared MiP and AiP in asymptomatic cases to those without either condition. Adjusted prevalence Odds odds ratios (aPOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to identify factors associated with asymptomatic MiP and AiP. Results We interviewed 308 study participants; their mean age was 26.6 years (± 5.8 years), mean gestational age was 21.8 weeks (± 6.0 weeks), 173 (56.2%) were in the second trimester of pregnancy, 12.9% (40/308) had MiP and 62.7% had AiP. Women who were aged ≤ 20 years had three times likelihood of developing MiP (aPOR = 3.1 Cl: 1.3–7.35) compared to those aged >20 years old. The likelihood of AiP was higher among women with gestational age ≥ 16 weeks (aPOR = 3.9, CI: 1.96–7.75), those with parasitemia (aPOR = 3.3, 95% CI: 1.31–8.18), those in third trimester of pregnancy (aPOR = 2.6, 95% CI:1.40–4.96) and those who reported eating soil as a craving during pregnancy (aPOR = 1.9, 95%CI:1.15–3.29). Conclusions Majority of the women had asymptomatic MiP and AiP. MiP was observed in one tenth of all study participants. Asymptomatic MiP was associated with younger age while AiP was associated with gestational age parasitemia, and soil consumption as a craving during pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W3091838267,"Base editing technology enables the generation of precisely genome-modified animal models. In this study, we applied base editing to chicken, an important livestock animal in the fields of agriculture, nutrition, and research through primordial germ cell (PGC)-mediated germline transmission. Using this approach, we successfully produced two genome-modified chicken lines harboring mutations in the genes encoding ovotransferrin (TF) and myostatin (MSTN); however, only 55.5% and 35.7% of genome-modified chickens had the desired base substitutions in TF and MSTN, respectively. To explain the low base-editing activity, we performed molecular analysis to compare DNA repair pathways between PGCs and the chicken fibroblast cell line DF-1. The results revealed that base excision repair (BER)-related genes were significantly elevated in PGCs relative to DF-1 cells. Subsequent functional studies confirmed that the editing activity could be regulated by modulating the expression of uracil N-glycosylase (UNG), an upstream gene of the BER pathway. Collectively, our findings indicate that the distinct DNA repair property of chicken PGCs causes low editing activity during genome modification, however, modulation of BER functions could promote the production of genome-modified organisms with the desired genotypes."

https://openalex.org/W3091999462,"Fixation materials used in the surgical treatment of subcondylar fractures contribute to successful clinical outcomes. In this study, we simulated the mechanical properties of four fixation materials [titanium (Ti), magnesium alloy (Mg alloy), poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA), and hydroxyapatite/poly-L-lactide (HA-PLLA)] in a finite-element analysis model of subcondylar fracture. Two four-hole plates were fixed on the anterior and posterior surfaces of the subcondyle of the mandible. In the simulation model of a subcondylar fracture, we evaluated the stress distribution and mechanical deformation of fixation materials. The stress distribution conspicuously appeared on the condylar neck of the non-fractured side and the center of the anterior plate for all materials. More stress distribution to the biologic component appeared with HA-PLLA than with Ti or Mg alloy, but its effects were less prominent than that of PLLA. The largest deformation was observed with PLLA, followed by HA-PLLA, Mg alloy, and Ti. The results of the present study imply the clinical potential of the HA-PLLA fixation material for open reduction of subcondylar fractures."
https://openalex.org/W3092415139,"Objective To evaluate the microbial loading in aerosols produced after air-puff by non-contact tonometer (NCT) as well as the effect of alcohol disinfection on the inhibition of microbes and thus to provide suggestions for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in ophthalmic departments of hospitals or clinics during the great pandemics. Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out in this study. A NIDEK NCT was used for intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement for patients who visited Department of Ophthalmology in Qilu Hospital of Shandong University during March 18–25 2020. After ultra-violate (UV) light disinfection, the room air was sampled for 5 minutes. Before and after alcohol disinfection, the air samples and nozzle surface samples were respectively collected by plate exposure method and sterile moist cotton swab technique after predetermined times of NCT air-puff. Microbial colony counts were calculated after incubation for 48 hours. Finally, mass spectrometry was performed for the accurate identification of microbial species. Results Increased microbial colonies were detected from air samples close to NCT nozzle after air-puff compared with air samples at a distance of 1 meter from the nozzle (p = 0.001). Interestingly, none microbes were detected on the surface of NCT nozzle. Importantly, after 75% alcohol disinfection less microbes were detected in the air beside the nozzle (p = 0.003). Microbial species identification showed more than ten strains of microbes, all of which were non-pathogenic. Conclusion Aerosols containing microbes were produced by NCT air-puff in the ophthalmic consultation room, which may be a possible virus transmission route in the department of ophthalmology during the COVID-19 pandemic. Alcohol disinfection for the nozzle and the surrounding air was efficient at decreasing the microbes contained in the aerosols and theoretically this prevention measure could also inhibit the virus. This will give guidance for the prevention of virus transmission and protection of hospital staff and patients."

The BIA results from individuals with normal weight were compared with two previously published studies in children by isotope dilution methods.Individuals with excessive weight had a higher mean TBW (27.87 L, SE 0.368) for height and age as compared to individuals with normal weight (23.95 L, SE 0.298), P<0.001. However, individuals with excessive weight had lower mean TBW (24.93 L, SE 0.37) for weight and body surface area (BSA) as compared to individuals with normal weight (26.94 L, SE 0.287), P<0.001. Comparison with two previously published studies showed no significant differences in mean TBW with one ((p = 1.00) but a significant difference with another study (p = 0.001).Individuals with excessive weight had 16.5% higher mean TBW for height and age and 7.4% lower TBW for weight and BSA as compared to normal weight individuals.

https://openalex.org/W3092535888,"Background Fractures of the pelvic ring in elderly patients have increased in frequency over time. These injuries are associated with a high morbidity and have a socio-economic impact. The diagnostic procedures and their influence of therapy decisions are still controversial. Methods In a retrospective study, we investigate the value of additional MRI examination on therapy decision of fragility fractures of the pelvis. The evaluation of all patients with pelvic fractures without adequate trauma and with performed CT and MRI was conducted at three large German hospitals. The imaging procedure took place within a maximum interval of 4 weeks. After evaluation of the imaging, the resulting therapeutic consequences either based on CT alone or on CT and MRI were reviewed by experienced pelvic surgeons. Results Of 754 patients with pelvic injuries, 67 (age 80 +/- 9.7 years, f: m 54:13) could be included. The detection of vertical fractures in CT (n = 40 unilateral, n = 11 bilateral) could be increased by the additional MRI (n = 44 unilateral, n = 23 bilateral). A horizontal fracture component was identified in CT in 9.0% (n = 6) vs. MRI in 25.4% (n = 17) of the cases. An anterior pelvic ring injury was detected in 71.6% (n = 44; 4x bilateral) in CT, in 80.6% in MRI (n = 50, 4 bilateral). Additive MRI imaging increased the decision rate for surgical therapy from 20.9% (n = 14) to 31.3% (n = 21). Conclusions The results of this study further support the value of bone marrow edema detection by MRI diagnostics (or dual source CT which showed promising initial results) for the detection of pelvic ring fractures. For the first time, the study identifies an additional therapeutic consequence by an increased rate of surgical procedures."
https://openalex.org/W3092646082,"Objectives To develop normative reference standards for estimated cardiorespiratory fitness (eCRF) measured from treadmill-based incremental exercise testing in ~12 000 British men and women. Methods Cross-sectional study using retrospectively collected eCRF data from five preventative health screening clinics in the United Kingdom. Reference centiles were developed using a parametric approach by fitting fractional polynomials. We selected the ‘best’ powers by considering both the smallest deviance, and clinical knowledge from the following set of a priori decided powers (-2,-1,-0.5, 0, 0.5,1,2,3). A series of fractional polynomials (FPs) were investigated with three-parameters (median, standard deviation and skewness). The following reference centiles were plotted (3, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 90, 95, 97). Results We included 9 204 males (median [25th,75th centiles] age 48 [44, 53] years; BMI 27 {25, 29] kg∙m-2; peak VO2 36.9 [30.5, 44.7] ml∙kg-1∙min-1) and 2 687 females (age 48, [41, 51] years; BMI 24 {22, 27] kg∙m-2; peak VO2 36.5 [30.1, 44.8] ml∙kg-1∙min-1) in our analysis to develop the normative values. Conclusion Reference values and nomograms for eCRF were derived from a relatively large cohort of preventative health care screening examinations of apparently healthy British men and women. Age- and sex-specific eCRF percentiles were similar to data from international cohort studies. The adoption of submaximal exercise testing protocols reduces individual risk when exercise history is unknown and testing is conducted in a community-based setting. Our findings can be used by health professionals to help guide clinical decision making."
https://openalex.org/W3092068257,"Background Despite treatment advances for inflammatory arthritis, a significant amount of patients fail to achieve remission. Other modifiable factors such as diet, physical activity and environmental exposures may be an important area of focus to help patients achieve disease remission and greater overall health. Functional medicine focuses on these lifestyle factors and may be an important adjunctive therapy. In this study, we examined the impact of functional medicine on patient-reported outcomes in patients with inflammatory arthritis. Materials and methods In this 12-week, retrospective study, patients with confirmed diagnoses of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or psoriatic arthritis (PsA) were treated according to guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology for RA or PSA respectively. Those in the functional medicine group underwent a functional medicine program adjunctive to the standard of care. Patient reported outcomes, such as PROMIS (Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) global physical health, mental health and pain scores were collected at baseline and 12 weeks. Multivariable statistical modeling was used to identify the impact of functional medicine on patient-reported outcomes. Results 318 patients were screened and 54 patients (mean age 52.9±11.3 years, females 74(67.9%)), were included. Baseline characteristics were similar in both patient groups with the exception of PROMIS global physical health and pain (PROMIS global physical health score 43·2 ± 6·6 and 39·7 ± 8·7 and pain scores of 3·5 ± 1·9 and 5·2 ± 2·7 in the functional medicine group vs. standard of care group respectively). Using multivariable model to account for these differences, patients in the functional medicine group had a statistically significant reduction in pain (0.92, p-value = 0.007) and change in PROMIS physical health score (2·84, p-value = 0.001) as compared to the standard of care. Changes in PROMIS global mental health scores were also significant and were dependent on age and were greatest in those older than 55. Limitations Retrospective design, baseline difference in patient reported outcomes. Conclusions Functional medicine may have an important role as adjunctive therapy to improve patients’ pain, physical and mental health in those who do not see improvement with conventional therapy alone."
https://openalex.org/W3092158975,"The eukaryotic blood parasite genus Trypanosoma includes several important pathogens of humans and livestock, but has been understudied in wildlife broadly. The trypanosomes that infect birds are in particular need of increased attention, as these parasites are abundant and globally distributed, yet few studies have addressed their evolutionary origins and diversity using modern molecular and analytical approaches. Of specific interest are the deep evolutionary relationships of the avian trypanosomes relative to the trypanosome species that are pathogenic in humans, as well as their species level diversity in regions where they have been understudied such as North America. Here, we address these unresolved areas of study using phylogenomic data for two species of avian trypanosomes that were isolated as “bycatch” from host transcriptome assemblies, as well as a large 18S DNA barcode sequence dataset that includes 143 novel avian Trypanosoma 18S sequences from North America. Using a phylogenomic approach, we find that the avian trypanosomes are nested within a clade of primarily mammalian trypanosomes that includes the human pathogen Trypanosoma cruzi, and are paraphyletic with respect to the ruminant trypanosome Trypanosoma theileri. DNA barcode sequences showed that T. avium and an unidentified small, non-striated trypanosome that was morphologically similar to T. everetti are each represented by highly abundant and divergent 18S haplotypes in North America. Community-level sampling revealed that additional species-level Trypanosoma lineages exist in this region. We compared the newly sequenced DNA barcodes from North America to a global database, and found that avian Trypanosoma 18S haplotypes generally exhibited a marked lack of host specificity with at least one T. avium haplotype having an intercontinental distribution. This highly abundant T. avium haplotype appears to have a remarkably high dispersal ability and cosmopolitan capacity to evade avian host immune defenses, which warrant further study."

https://openalex.org/W3091823254,"Aim To investigate the cost-effectiveness of Volar Locking Plate (VLP) compared to External Fixation (EF) for unstable dorsally displaced distal radius fractures in a 3-year perspective. Methods During 2009–2013, patients aged 50–74 years with an unstable dorsally displaced distal radius fracture were randomised to VLP or EF. Primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for VLP compared with EF. Data regarding health effects (Quality-adjusted life years, QALYs) was prospectively collected during the trial period until 3 years after surgery. Cost data was collected retrospectively for the same time period and included direct and indirect costs (production loss). Results One hundred and thirteen patients (VLP n = 58, EF n = 55) had complete data until 3 years and were used in the analysis. At one year, the VLP group had a mean incremental cost of 878 euros and a gain of 0.020 QALYs compared with the EF group, rendering an ICER of 43 900 euros per QALY. At three years, the VLP group had a mean incremental cost of 1 082 euros and a negative incremental effect of -0.005 QALYs compared to the EF group, which means that VLP was dominated by EF. The probability that VLP was cost-effective compared to EF at three years, was lower than 50% independent of the willingness to pay per QALY. Conclusion Three years after distal radius fracture surgery, VLP fixation resulted in higher costs and a smaller effect in QALYs compared to EF. Our results indicate that it is uncertain if VLP is a cost-effective treatment of unstable distal radius fractures compared to EF."
https://openalex.org/W3091952807,"BRCA1/2 genetic testing offers tremendous opportunities for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of breast and ovarian cancer. Women acquire valuable information that can help them to make informed decisions about their health. However, knowing one’s susceptibility to developing cancer may be burdensome for several women, as this risk needs to be managed over time through a continuous dialogue with multiple healthcare professionals. We explored how communication between physicians and unaffected women carrying BRCA1/2 germline pathogenic variants was experienced by women in relation to their genetic risk. Data came from qualitative interviews conducted in Switzerland with 32 unaffected women carrying BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants and aware of their genetic status for at least 3 years. We identified three different types of message as conveyed by physicians to women: (1) a normative message, (2) an over-empowering message, and (3) a minimizing message. On one hand, we found that women are exposed to contradictory messages, often simultaneously, in their interactions with healthcare professionals during their post-genetic testing journey. On the other hand, women’s reports highlighted the absence of shared decision-making in such interactions. The combination of these two findings resulted in a strong sense of disorientation, frustration, and powerlessness among participants. Healthcare professionals interacting with high cancer risk women are urged to align in favor of a both concerted and shared decision-making approach when discussing options for managing genetic risk."
https://openalex.org/W3092330998,"Background The correlation between pulse transit time and blood pressure has been proposed as a route to measure continuous non-invasive blood pressure. We investigated whether pulse transit time trends could model blood pressure trends during episodes of rapid declines in blood pressure. Methods From the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care waveform database we identified substantial blood pressure reductions. Pulse transit time was calculated from the R-peak of the electrocardiogram to the peak of the arterial pulse waveform. The time-series were processed with a moving average filter before comparison. Averaged, continuous heart rate was also analysed as a control. The intra-individual association between variables was assessed per subject using linear regression. Results In the 511 patients included we found a median correlation coefficient between blood pressure and pulse transit time of -0.93 (IQR -0.98 to -0.76) with regression slopes of -1.23 mmHg/ms (IQR -1.73 to -0.81). The median correlation coefficient between blood pressure and heart rate was 0.46 (IQR -0.16 to 0.83). In supplementary analysis, results did not differ substantially when widening inclusion criteria, but the results were not always consistent within subjects across episodes of hypotension. Conclusions In a large cohort of critically ill patients experiencing episodes of rapid declines in systolic blood pressure, there was a moderate-strong intra-individual correlation between averaged systolic blood pressure and averaged pulse transit time. Our findings encourage further investigation into using the pulse transit time for non-invasive real-time detection of hypotension."
https://openalex.org/W3092148224,"The present study investigated physicians’ perceptions regarding the need for, effects of, and barriers to disclosure of patient safety incidents (DPSI). An anonymous online questionnaire survey was conducted to investigate physicians’ perception regarding DPSI, in particular of when DPSI was needed in various situations and of methods for facilitating DPSI. Physicians’ perceptions were then compared to the general public’s perceptions regarding DPSI identified in a previous study. A total of 910 physicians participated. Most participants (94.9%) agreed that any serious medical error should be disclosed to patients and their caregivers, whereas only 39.8% agreed that even near-miss errors, which did not cause harm to patients, should be disclosed. Among the six known effects of DPSI presented, participating physicians showed the highest level of agreement (89.6%) that “DPSI will lead physicians to pay more attention to patient safety in the future.” Among six barriers to DPSI, participants showed the most agreement (75.9%) that “It is unreasonable to demand DPSI in only the medical field, and disclosure is not actively conducted in other fields.” With respect to methods for facilitating DPSI, participants agreed that “A guideline for DPSI is needed” (91.2%) and “Manpower to support DPSI in hospitals is required” (89.1%). Meanwhile, 79.3% agreed that “If an apology law is enacted, physicians will perform more DPSI” and 72.4% that “I support the introduction of an apology law.” Korean physicians generally have a positive perception of DPSI, but less than the general public."

During a diversity study of yeasts inhabiting the flowers of Metrosideros polymorpha (Myrtaceae) in the Hawai’i Volcanoes National Park (HI, USA), five isolates were found to represent two novel species. Morphological and physiological characterization, and sequence analysis of the small subunit ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, the D1/D2 domains of the large subunit rRNA genes, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions, and the genes encoding the largest and second largest subunits of the RNA polymerase II (RPB1 and RPB2, respectively), classified both species in the family Metschnikowiaceae, and we propose the names Candida metrosideri pro tempore sp. nov.

https://openalex.org/W3092551706,"Spacetime, reconstructed Theories of holographic duality feature a correspondence between a gravitational system and a strongly interacting conformal field theory (CFT) living on the system's boundary. Through this correspondence, the CFT encodes the geometry of spacetime in the gravitational system. Van Raamsdonk analyzed the role of entanglement in this theoretical framework. Instead of considering a single CFT, the author's starting point was a collection of CFT “bits” that are mutually entangled but do not interact with one another. The spacetime that these bits collectively encode was then shown to be arbitrarily close to the one encoded by the original CFT, suggesting that entanglement plays a crucial role in the emergence of spacetime.

https://openalex.org/W3091875705,"Finding music pieces whose similarity is explainable in plain musical terms can be of considerable value in many applications. We propose a composition grouping method based on musicological approach. The underlying idea is to compare music notation to natural language. In music notation, a musical theme corresponds to a word. The more similar motives we find in two musical pieces, the higher is their overall similarity score. We develop the definition of a motive as well as the way to compare motives and whole compositions. To verify our framework we conduct a number of grouping and classification experiments for typical musical corpora. They include works by classical composers and examples of folk music. Obtained results are encouraging; the method is able to find non-obvious similarities, yet its operation remains explicable on the ground of music history. The proposed approach can be used in music recommendation and anti-plagiarism systems. Due to the musicological flavor, one of potentially best applications of our method would be that in computer assisted music analysis tools."
https://openalex.org/W3092031388,"The objective of this study was to assess the quality of life and psychological wellbeing of adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) in Chile, and to identify other associated factors. The study enrolled 68 patients aged between 18 and 72 (median 29), 35 being females. They completed a questionnaire, which included a quality of life assessment tool (the Medical Outcome Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey), a number of psychological scales (the General Health Questionnaire, the Basic Psychological Needs Scales and the Beck Hopelessness Scale), a socioeconomic survey, and some clinical data. CHD patients reported worse scores in those scales assessing physical dimensions of quality of life (physical function (70.5), physical role functioning (64), vitality (65.3)), and general quality of life (58.6), than in emotional or social dimensions. Female gender was associated with lower scores in physical function (59.12 versus 82.66; p<0.01) and physical role functioning (53.68 versus 75; p<0.05); poverty was associated with worse results in physical function (61.92 versus 82.96; p<0.01), role physical (53.21 versus 79.63; p<0.01), vitality (60.89 versus 71.67; p<0.05), social role functioning (70.19 versus 82.87; p<0.05) and bodily pain (65.77 versus 81.2; p<0.05). Furthermore, we found that psychological scales had an association with quality of life, but clinical variables did not show significant correlations to any dimension. Poverty has an impact on the quality of life of CHD patients. This population only has a decrease in the quality of life physical dimensions, suggesting that quality of life depends on many different factors."
https://openalex.org/W3091775885,"The nonprofit Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) sponsors a series of Science Research Conferences (SRCs) each year. These conferences offer scientists a collegial and relaxing environment to discuss and explore new findings and approaches to specific research areas. They feature small-group settings in which scientists, faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students discuss scientific advances and share cutting-edge research through lectures, poster sessions, and informal discussions. The FASEB Science Research Conference on Microbial Glycobiology was held on July 13-14, 2020. The FASEB Conference on Microbial Glycobiology is a biennial meeting that forms part of the FASEB SRC Series. The Microbial Glycobiology Conference provides in-depth focus on emerging glycobiological topics such as host-pathogen interactions, the human microbiome, glycan-based vaccines and therapeutics, and industrial applications including biofilms and enzymes. This diversity recognizes the growing importance of microbial glycobiology in health and technology. Due to the COVID-19 pandemics, the 2020 FASEB Conference on Microbial Glycobiology was carried out in a virtual setting featuring 120 participants from different countries worldwide. The conference showcased exciting new avenues and novel research in the broad field of microbial glycobiology, covering aspects dealing with virulence and pathogenicity of microbes, as well as the critical role of microbes in the gut for health and homeostasis. The conference was organized in four thematic scientific sessions and featured Dr. M. Stephen Trent as the Keynote Speaker. He described the intricate mechanisms of adaptation of Acinetobacter baumannii, showing how this emerging, multidrug-resistant opportunistic bacterium can survive without lipopolysaccharide and unravelling the compensatory mechanisms associated with antimicrobial resistance. His findings expand our notions on bacterial cell envelope biogenesis, providing a framework for future studies to unravel the connections between lipid A and lipopolysaccharide synthesis in general and cell wall peptidoglycan biogenesis. Session 1, chaired by Nathalie Juge (Quadram Institute Bioscience, Norwich, UK), concerned the glycobiology of microbe-host interactions. This session covered topics on mucus and gut microbiota with a focus on the role of host glycans and dietary glycans on the interaction with microbes. The opening talk was given by Gunnar Hansson (University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden), the world leader in the study of mucus biochemistry and biology. His seminal work on mucus in the gut has inspired a novel generation of scientists from all over the world, as was evident from the number of poster and oral presentations given on mucins throughout the conference. During his presentation we learned new information about the heterogeneity of mucus secreted in the gut and the different types of goblet cells, spanning a diverse family of cells generating several specialized mucus layers to respond to bacterial challenge. His presentation was followed by presentations from Clara Belzer (Wageningen University, Wageningen, The Netherlands) on the role of human milk oligosaccharides in priming gut bacteria to adapt to the gut mucus layer and the effect of mucin glycans on biofilm formation and microbial signaling and virulence (Katharina Ribbeck, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA). We then dug deep into the molecular and structural mechanisms underpinning how bacteria recognize, transport, and metabolize complex glycans. We learned from Andrew Bell (Quadram Institute Bioscience), Nathalie Juge, and Gavin Thomas (University of York, York, UK) about the critical role of sialic acid, a major carbohydrate in mucins, in modulating commensal and pathogens in the gut. We then explored the set of polysaccharide-utilization loci (PULs), glycoside hydrolase (GH) families, and glycan-binding proteins required for members of the gut microbiota to metabolize the dietary glycans or mucin glycans through short talks and invited presentations. Nicole Koropatkin (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) focused her presentation on the structural features underpinning surface glycan-binding lipoproteins to target starch, xyloglucan, and mixed-linkage β-glucans in PULs from Bacteroidetes. In his prerecorded presentation, Harry Brumer (University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada) further described the interplay of cell-surface GH and glycan-binding proteins enable specific Bacteroides strains to utilize β(1,3)-glucans, which constitute dietary fiber from algal, yeast, and plant cell walls, highlighting the role of the new GH family 158. Two short talks completed this session. Matthew Ostrowski (University of Michigan) shared his work on the metabolism of xanthan gum, a common food additive, highlighting the role of a novel GH5 enzyme in this process. Finally, Lucy Crouch (University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK) presented her latest and exciting data on the discovery of endo-acting O-glycanases within the GH16 family that have the capacity to target the polyLacNAc structures within oligosaccharide side chains of mammalian mucins. Overall, Session 1 highlighted advances in both commensal and pathogen microbial glycobiology, reflecting the growing interest and recognized importance of mucus and the gut microbiota in this field. There is clear benefit and value to be gained by considering all aspects of microbial glycobiology, and the two fields are starting to come together to address biological questions such as how commensals and pathogens compete or interact in situ. The growing interest in gut microbiota has renewed the importance of microbial and host glycans to the wider scientific community and provides a route to promote glycobiology across disciplines. Session 2, chaired by Fikri Avci (University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA), highlighted studies on microbial virulence mechanisms and glycan-based therapeutic and prophylactic approaches against viral and bacterial pathogens. In her opening talk, Alla Zamyatina (BOKU, Vienna, Austria) presented lipopolysaccharide and its lipid A moiety as major virulence factors for Gram-negative bacteria. She summarized the host toll-like receptor (TLR) interactions of lipid A followed by delineating LPS-TLR interactions at the structural and biochemical level through the use of synthetic lipid A and lipid A mimetics developed in her laboratory. We next learned about another major bacterial virulence factor, the capsular polysaccharide (CPS), from Rita Gerardy-Schahn (Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany) who presented a compelling case for utilizing the polymerases that facilitate the biosynthesis of CPSs to develop tools for the production of nature-identical, knowledge-based vaccines against encapsulated bacterial pathogens. Next, a novel bacterial virulence factor EndoS secreted by Group A streptococcus (GAS) was introduced by Mattias Collin (Lund University, Lund, Sweden). EndoS is an endoglycosidase that specifically cleaves the N-glycan on the Fc region of IgG antibodies, thereby impairing their effector function. Through IgG hydrolysis by EndoS, GAS evades adaptive immune responses. We next shifted gears to a viral pathogen and learned about adaptive humoral immune responses induced by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) gp120 envelope glycoprotein, from Fikri Avci; he reported recent findings from his laboratory demonstrating that a CD4+ helper T-cell repertoire recognizes a glycopeptide epitope on gp120 presented by MHCII pathway. This glycopeptide is highly immunogenic and elicits neutralizing antibody production upon immunization. Session 2 continued with selected short talks that focused on host interactions of microbial factors and their effect in pathogenicity or symbiosis. Ana Luis (University of Gothenburg) presented her work on mucin utilizing sulfatases and fucosidases by Bacteroides; Meztlli Gaytan (Abigail Wexner Research Institute, Columbus, OH, USA) introduced a novel sialic acid-binding adhesin contributing to the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis; Mindy Engevik (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA) gave a presentation focused on microbial degradation of ileal mucus that promotes rotavirus infection; Christian Bull (Copenhagen Center for Glycomics, Copenhagen, Denmark) proposed a cell-based mucin display to study mucosal interactions of microbes; Didier Ndeh (Quadram Institute) described a methyltransferase expressed by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron as an essential factor for pectin metabolism in the human gut; and in the last presentation of the session, Ekaterina Buzun (Newcastle University, Newcastle, UK) delineated mechanisms employed by Bacteroides type 9 secretion of glycoside hydrolases in the gut glycan metabolism. Overall, Session 2 laid out our current understanding of the major virulence mechanisms employed by microbial products and ways we can utilize these mechanisms and microbial products to develop strategies and products to combat infectious diseases. We also learned about the advances in host interactions of symbiotic bacteria and how these interactions modulate homeostasis and dysbiosis. Session 3, chaired by Nichollas Scott (University of Melbourne), explored protein glycosylation and the increasing recognition of these systems across microbial organisms. The session opened with Justin Boddey (Walter AND Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia), who discussed his work on the role of glycosylation on protein stability within Plasmodium falciparum and, in particular, how O-fucosylation affects the protein stability of key surface proteins that are essential for mosquito/vertebrate transmission. Boddy revealed exciting results that C-glycosylation also plays a critical role in parasite transmission and highlighted the potential to improve malaria vaccines by incorporating these modifications. This theme was extended in the prerecorded lecture by Igor Almeida (University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX, USA), who highlighted his work harnessing the power of glycotopes for vaccines and biomarkers for Trypanosome cruzi, the causing agent of Chagas disease. Keeping with the theme of protein glycosylation, Nichollas Scott discussed his interest in O-linked glycosylation within the Burkholderia genus and his work to improve our understanding of the pan-Burkholderia glycoproteome. He highlighted that the glycoproteome of Burkholderia species is far greater than anticipated, with nearly 200 proteins subjected to glycosylation in the cystic fibrosis pathogen Burkholderia cenocepacia. Next, the session moved from a focus on glycoproteins to glycolipids with Stephen Cochrane (Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK) discussing his work developing novel probes based on undecaprenyl lipids derived from plants; he elegantly demonstrated how semisynthetic approaches can be used to produced novel undecaprenyl probes at a near-gram scale, opening new avenues for the study of bacterial glycopolymers. Michael Koomey (University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway), returned to the topic of protein glycosylation and presented his recent findings on the evolution of the Neisseria O-linked glycosylation system and pan-Neisseria glycoproteome. He highlighted the exciting observation that subtle differences in oligosaccharyl transferases from Neisseria species have profound effects on the substrates targeted for glycosylation. The concept of subtle differences in transferases affecting substrate targeting was also mirrored in the prerecorded presentation from Elizabeth Hartland (Hudson Institute of Medical Research, Clayton, VIC, Australia). Speaking about her pioneering work characterizing the arginine glycosyltransferase effectors, Hartland highlighted that although similar in sequence, the NleB/SseK effectors target discrete substrates during infections. In the final invited talk of the session, we heard from Giulia Bandini (University of York), an emerging leader in the field of Toxoplasma glycosylation, who described SPY-catalysed O-fucosylation. Bandini highlighted her recent findings on the functional consequences of SPY and the role of O-fucosylation in parasite fitness. These presentations were followed by short talks. Mingji Li (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA) reported a novel and useful scanning glycomutagenesis approach to understand structure-activity relationships of glycosylation sites in proteins. Jaqueline Gerhardt (University of Campinas, Campinas, SP, Brazil) discussed the influence of N-glycosylation pathway mutants on recombinant enzyme production in fungal systems and lastly, Nadine L. Samara (U.S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA), showed data on the structure of the N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase T12 and the importance of non-conserved residues for substrate glycosylation. Overall, Session 3 showcased both emerging and established group leaders drawing the community’s attention to the wide variety of protein glycosylation systems now identified in microbes. The growing recognition and interest in these systems resulted from improvements in the tools at the community’s disposal, such as novel probes and mass spectrometry instrumentation. As these tools continue to improve, we anticipate additional novel findings in the microbial protein glycosylation space, emphasizing the biological relevance of protein glycosylation in the physiology, and adaption of microbes, as well as a novel target for developing new therapies and diagnostic tools. Session 4, chaired by Carole Creuzenet (University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada), continued with the microbial glycan synthesis and surfaces theme. The talks in this session described the novel uses of glycosylation mechanisms or glycan-degrading enzymes for diagnostics and the development of new antimicrobials, as well as other talks highlighting the fundamental aspects of surface glycan synthesis and adaptations of such mechanisms to host/microbe interactions. The opening talk of this session was provided by Zuzanna Drulis-Kawa (University of Wroclaw, Wroclaw, Poland), who developed the fascinating angle of exploiting phages and their glycan-degrading enzymes as alternatives to antimicrobials, a very timely research area in the light of rising antimicrobial resistance that has resulted in many pathogens being declared as priority pathogens by the World Health Organization. Carmen Galan (University of Bristol, Bristol, UK) then described highly innovative antibacterial carbon nanodots that can be exploited to label and eliminate clinical microorganisms. This was followed by Jose A. Bengoecha (Queen’s University Belfast) and Paola Sperandeo (University of Milan, Milan, Italy) who revealed new advances in our understanding of lipid A adaptations to virulence after tissue exposure and lipopolysaccharide transport, respectively, and by Carole Creuzenet, who described how the capsule synthesis machinery of Campylobacter jejuni can be exploited to curtail campylobacteriosis. We then explored a variety of mechanisms that allow bacteria to optimize their interactions with hosts. Two talks related to protein glycosylation: Ravin Seepersaud (San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center and University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA) described the role of O-acetylation on protein glycosylation for streptococcal binding to human platelets, and Dimitris Latousakis (Quadram Institute Biosciences) described O-protein glycosylation in gut commensal bacteria. Two further talks related to modifications in the surface polysaccharides: Yang Shen (Institute of Food, Nutrition, and Health, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland) showed how bacteriophages induce modifications in the surface of Listeria by effecting enzymes involved in wall teichoic acid synthesis, and Sarah N. Tindall (University of York) described the role of O-acetylation in O-antigen modification in Salmonella. Finally, two talks highlighted the role of lectins in host-pathogen interactions and immune modulation: Dimitra Lamprinaki (Quadram Institute Biosciences) discussed how Siglec lectins contribute to immunomodulation induced by Fusarium in colorectal cancer, and Kelly Lee (School of Life Sciences, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK) showed how ligands at the surface of Pseudomonas aeruginosa interfere with C-type lectin receptor function. Overall, Session 4 covered a breadth of topics and bacterial species, from enhanced fundamental discovery in mechanisms of surface glycan synthesis and their host- or phage-induced modifications, to innovative applications of glycan synthesis pathways to curtail disease, and provide alternative to antimicrobials, as well as the effect of surface glycans on the host response, covering both commensal and pathogenic bacteria. The breadth of topics covered highlights the high potential of glycobiology in the in-depth understanding and potentially better control of host-microbe interactions.
