https://openalex.org/W1581948411,Abstract The minimum acidity required for the cleavage of the heme-protein link by Teale's acid butanone method was determined for several ferric protohemoproteins. The cleavage of the link occurs at pH values approximately 1 unit higher in the presence than in the absence of 0.1 m NaF for all the hemoproteins examined. Cytochrome c peroxidase was cleaved into the heme and apoenzyme by a modification of Teale's method. Apoenzyme could be recombined with heme to form a reconstituted holoenzyme with properties indistinguishable from those of the original cytochrome c peroxidase. Both apoenzymes and reconstituted holoenzymes were crystallized as large prisms which may be suitable for physical measurements of single crystals.

The specific activity of lecithin-32P in chylomicrons relative to that in the oil increased directly with the amount of lecithin fed, whereas the lecithin content of chylomicrons was constant. About 40% of the phospholipid in chylomicrons was derived from the meal when the lecithin content of the meal was 6 to 11%. When 1-palmitoyl-9,10-3H-lecithin-32P was fed, one-fifth of the 3H recovered in chylomicrons was present in lecithin and the ratio of 3H:32P in lecithin in chylomicrons was the same as that in the oil. When 1-palmitoyl-9,10-3H, 2-linoleoyl-1-14C-lecithin-32P was fed, 5% of the 14C recovered in chylomicrons was found in lecithin, and the ratios of 14C:3H and of 14C:32P in chylomicron lecithin were only 20% of that in the lecithin fed. The ratio of choline-3H to 32P in lecithin of chylomicrons collected from rats fed choline-(methyl)-3H lecithin-32P was the same as that in the oil meal. Up to 40% of 1-acyl lysolecithin-32P fed with corn oil was recovered in chylomicron lecithin in 6 hours. The findings indicate that dietary lecithin is hydrolyzed and absorbed as lysolecithin and subsequently reacylated before being incorporated into lymph chylomicrons."

https://openalex.org/W2069420917,"THE thalidomide molecule contains an asymmetric carbon atom, but the form of the drug which has been used therapeutically and which has produced congenital malformations in man is the optically inactive form, that is (±)-thalidomide. The optical antipodes of thalidomide have been synthesized1,2, and Dr A. M. Creighton has supplied samples of both (+)- and (−)-thalidomide. The (+)-isomer, melting point 240°–241° C, showed [α]D20+60° (c = 2 in dimethylformamide) and the (−)-isomer, melting point 241°–242° C; showed [α]D20−58° (c = 2 in dimethylformamide). (±)-Thalidomide has a melting point of 271° C and, of course, is optically inactive. With these samples, we have determined the acute oral toxicities of the three forms in mice, their teratogenic activity in the New Zealand white rabbit and their effect on the hypnosis induced by hexobarbitone in mice."
https://openalex.org/W1585628491,"Abstract Complex III of the mitochondrial respiratory chain is cleaved either by bile salts in conjunction with ammonium sulfate or by low concentrations of guanidinium salts, to yield an insoluble fraction containing cytochrome b and a soluble fraction containing cytochrome c1. This cleavage is blocked absolutely by pretreatment of Complex III with antimycin A in an amount stoichiometric with the cytochrome c1 content of the complex. However, under selected conditions (i.e. 3.0 m guanidine-HCl or 0.2 m guanidine-HCl plus freezing), guanidine cleaves Complex III despite pretreatment of the complex with antimycin A. Urea (6 m) and methyl-substituted guanidines, as well as biguanide, are all relatively ineffective as promoters of the cleavage reaction; however, prolonged treatment of Complex III with low concentrations of octylguanidine or phenylethylbiguanide is partially effective in cleaving the complex. Cleavage of Complex III appears to occur in two distinct steps: a primary, first order destruction of sensitivity of cleavage to antimycin A, and a secondary step involving an antimycin-insensitive polymerization and precipitation of cytochrome b. The primary (antimycin-sensitive) process is accelerated at either acid or alkaline pH values whether promoted by bile salt plus ammonium sulfate or by guanidine. The antimycin-sensitive cleavage is inhibited not only by antimycin A, but also by both 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide and the antimycin analogue N-octadecyl-3-formamidosalicylamide. Reduction of Complex III either by reducing substrates (succinate or reduced coenzyme Q) or by strictly chemical reagents (sodium dithionite) mimics the action of antimycin A in causing a blockage of the cleavage reaction. Because this blockage cannot be ascribed to reduction of any of the characterized components of Complex III, it is proposed that a new oxidation-reduction component with a potential intermediate between the potentials of cytochromes b and c1 is involved intimately with the site of cleavage and the antimycin-sensitive site of Complex III."

The animals are permanently tolerant of cells of both original types, remain free of runt disease, and display a normal and specific immune response to introduction of a foreign antigen. Absence of autoimmunity in development of ordinary animals is explainable by the ""intrinsic"" kind of tolerance found here."
https://openalex.org/W1488309229,"Abstract Partial reduction of the basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor with sodium borohydride results in the selective cleavage of the disulfide bond linking half-cystine residues 14 and 38. The partially reduced inhibitor is fully active, whereas its carboxymethylated derivative is completely inactive and is susceptible to tryptic digestion. The reduced inhibitor slowly reoxidizes when incubated alone at pH 8. In contrast, when the reduced inhibitor is first allowed to form a complex with trypsin, no reoxidation occurs at pH 8.0 for at least 25 min."
https://openalex.org/W2108110716,"Abstract Bovine serum albumin, in aqueous guanidine hydrochloride, interacts preferentially with the solvent components, as was shown by techniques in which refractometry and light scattering and equilibrium dialysis were used. If constant salt molality after dialysis is taken as the reference state for zero binding, then 0.08 ± 0.03 and 0.18 ± 0.05 g of salt per g of protein is bound at 3 m and 6 m salt, respectively, with similar values at 4 and 5 m salt. These results indicate ren that (v2)t,µt,µ1,µ,µ2 (obtained by measuring the difference in density between a protein solution and its dialysate) is 2 to 3% less than the value obtained at constant molality of salt."
https://openalex.org/W1872820540,"Abstract The sulfhydryl groups of Complex III of the electron transport chain were titrated with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) under a variety of conditions. In the absence of added detergents, a total of about eight sulfhydryl groups per complex was readily titratable by DTNB, whether the complex was oxidized, reduced, or inhibited with antimycin A. Titration of eight sulfhydryl groups with DTNB or with mersalyl did not affect enzymic activity. The enzyme was, however, reversibly inactivated by 12 eq of mersalyl. In the presence of high levels of taurocholate or guanidine hydrochloride, 23 sulfhydryl groups were titrated by DTNB per mole of oxidized complex. When the complex was reduced prior to prolonged incubation with DTNB in concentrated detergent, 14 to 15 sulfhydryl groups were titrated. In the presence of antimycin A, only 12 groups were titrated in the oxidized complex. The decreased titer in these latter two cases probably reflected an increased conformational stability of the complex attendant upon reduction or treatment with antimycin A. However, the decreased titration in the case of the reduced complex was due only indirectly to this stabilizing effect. Enzymatic activity was lost upon digestion of the complex with phospholipase A but was partially restored by treatment with phospholipid. The complex was irreversibly inactivated by incubation with trypsin or chymotrypsin, the rate of this inactivation being greater when the complex was in the reduced state. The non-heme iron protein of the complex was the component most sensitive to tryptic digestion. Electrophoresis of the complex on polyacrylamide gel revealed six major, staining species. Fractionation procedures were used to assign identities to these species. In order of increasing mobility, these were a new major protein component (core protein); polymeric cytochrome c1; non-heme iron protein; monomeric cytochrome c1; cytochrome b; and a new, as yet uncharacterized, component. A new technique was used to separate the components of the complex, based on the solubility of certain species in methanol or chloroform-methanol following precipitation by acid. The over-all organization of the complex is discussed in the light of these findings."
https://openalex.org/W1546922398,"Abstract A novel, simple, and rapid procedure is described for the regeneration of native α and β polypeptide chains of human hemoglobin from their mercuribenzoate derivatives. The main feature of the method is the controlled emulsification of the mercuribenzoate derivatives with the water-insoluble thiol, 1-dodecanethiol. The regenerated chains show the theoretical number of —SH groups per heme, are essentially homogeneous in gel electrophoresis, and, when mixed in equimolar amounts, rapidly produce a compound which is indistinguishable from hemoglobin A in gel electrophoresis and in its reaction with oxygen. Sedimentation analyses reveal single boundaries for the individual chains and their equimolar product, with sedimentation coefficients in agreement with previously published values. The enthalpy of the reaction of the individual regenerated chains with oxygen has been determined and found to be -13.5 kcal per mole, a value very close to that reported for the oxygenation of hemoglobin. This finding lends strong support to the notion that the heme-heme interaction, observed in the reaction of oxygen with hemoglobin, is largely an entropy effect."

https://openalex.org/W1556950428,"Mammalian succinate dehydrogenase exists in unactivated and activated states. Transition of the unactivated enzyme to the activated form appears to be a conformation change initiated by combination of the protein with substrates or competitive inhibitors and results in a many-fold increase in catalytic activity. This activation has now been shown to be reversible on removal of the bound activating agent by gel exclusion in the case of the soluble enzyme and by repeated washing and centrifugation or gel exclusion in the case of particles. While the activation has a very high energy of activation and does not proceed at observable rates at 15°, the deactivation is rapid even at temperatures near 0°. The ease of deactivation depends on the tightness of the binding of the activator. With tightly bound activators, such as malonate, replacement of the bound activator with succinate, followed by removal of the latter on Sephadex columns, has been found to be particularly effective. A modest degree of activation of succinate dehydrogenase occurs in particulate and soluble preparations also without added activating agents at 38°. This type of temperature activation may be due to the presence of traces of bound activator in the preparation. The activation-deactivation cycle has major effects on succinoxidase activity and on all types of succinate dehydrogenase assays, but the fumarate-FMNH2 reaction (fumarate reductase activity) is unchanged by these treatments. The spectral shifts accompanying the activation are not reversed by removal of the activator and consequent deactivation. It appears, however, that the colored enzyme-competitive inhibitor complexes form only with the fully activated enzyme, although the same competitive inhibitors combine with the unactivated form in a colorless complex."
https://openalex.org/W1538710951,"The synthesis of deoxythymidine from thymine in cell-free systems prepared from human leukocytes is mediated by two enzymatic mechanisms, pyrimidine deoxyribosyl transferase and deoxythymidine phosphorylase. Both activities are probably a function of one protein. Deoxythymidine synthesis by either mechanism is inhibited by thymine. This inhibition by thymine of pyrimidine deoxyribosyl transferase is competitive with the deoxyribosyl donor, while inhibition of deoxythymidine phosphorylase is of a mixed type, resulting in both a decrease in the Vmax and an increase in the Km for deoxyribose 1-phosphate. Similarly, uracil inhibition of deoxyuridine synthesis by the phosphorylase mechanism is of a mixed type. However, there is essentially no inhibition by uracil of deoxyuridine synthesis mediated by pyrimidine deoxyribosyl transferase. Pyrimidine deoxyribosyl transferase is activated by inorganic arsenate or phosphate. This activation is not due to an increase in the affinity of the enzyme for either deoxyuridine or thymine, nor is it due to a shift in the pH optimum. The enzymatic mechanisms for deoxythymidine synthesis are, therefore, influenced by modifiers. The possible physiological importance of the response to modifiers is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1496285576,"Abstract Methods are described for the isolation of a new protein component, namely core protein, from Complex III of the electron transfer chain. One method involves prior precipitation of cytochrome b and non-heme iron protein from a taurocholate-ammonium sulfate dispersion of the unreduced intact complex, followed by precipitation of core protein by treating the supernatant solution containing cytochrome c1 with sodium mersalyl. A second method involves precipitation of non-heme iron protein alone from a taurocholate-ammonium sulfate dispersion of the dithionite-reduced complex, followed by precipitation of core protein by addition of sodium mersalyl to the supernatant solution containing both cytochromes b and c1. Core protein, as isolated, is homogeneous upon electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel and accounts for about 50% of the protein of Complex III. It is essentially free of heme, phospholipids, and bile salts and contains no prosthetic group as yet identified. It has a molecular weight of 40,000 to 50,000; there are, therefore, 3 to 4 molecules of core protein per molecule of Complex III. Studies with a number of different sulfhydryl reagents provide evidence that cleavage of core protein from the other components of Complex III, followed by its precipitation, involves the blocking of a free sulfhydryl group (or groups), either those occurring on the core protein, or possibly the sulfhydryl groups of some other component of Complex III. It is shown that antimycin A decreases the rate of mersalyl-induced release of core protein from the supernatant solution containing, in addition, both cytochrome b and cytochrome c1, but not its rate of release from the supernatant solution containing only cytochrome c1. The rate of release of core protein from the supernatant solution containing both cytochromes b and c1 parallels the rate of destruction of the antimycin-binding site as measured by the release of antimycin A. This finding provides strong evidence that core protein is an integral and functional part of Complex III."

The resulting abnormal tryptic peptide, δT-3, is thus identical with the corresponding β chain peptide. The possible evolutionary significance of this relationship is discussed. Further evidence is presented that Hemoglobin A'2 (B2) obtained from three different sources is characterized by the substitution of an arginyl residue for the glycyl residue in position 16 of the δ chain. The amino acid compositions of all the other tryptic peptides from these two variant hemoglobins were normal."

https://openalex.org/W1500440092,"Abstract The nature of the binding of antimycin A to Complex III of the mitochondrial respiratory chain was investigated according to two procedures. In the first procedure, tritium-labeled antimycin A was extracted from its binding to Complex III either by acetone or by concentrated solutions of taurocholate. Seventy per cent of the complex-bound antimycin A was extracted by either reagent. The acetone-extracted antimycin A was found to be fully inhibitory to the reduced coenzyme Q-cytochrome c reductase activity of Complex III. Moreover, even though most of the antimycin A was extracted from Complex III by taurocholate, its inhibitory effect on the cleavage of the complex was retained. The second procedure utilized enzymically active Complex III as a reagent to detect antimycin A that failed to be bound to, or was released from, an enzymically inactive Complex III. The binding of antimycin A to intact Complex III was found to be essentially irreversible, little or no transfer of antimycin A from antimycin-treated complex to untreated complex being observed. High levels of detergent (3 to 5% taurocholate) in the reaction mixture permitted some transfer of the antimycin A. Conditions that normally caused cleavage of Complex III (i.e. bile salts plus ammonium sulfate, or 1.0 m guanidine), or digestion with trypsin, destroyed the capacity of the complex to bind antimycin A. Reagents that cleaved Complex III despite the treatment of the complex with antimycin A (i.e. 3.0 m guanidine, 0.2 m guanidine plus freezing, or taurocholate plus mersalyl) also caused a release of antimycin A from the complex. Noninhibitory derivatives of antimycin A (i.e. the O-methyl ether of antimycin or deformylantimycin A) offered little or no competition to antimycin A in its binding to Complex III."
https://openalex.org/W1549680099,"Abstract Partial hepatectomy and acute stress (Celite) cause no changes in the levels in vivo of liver ATP or total adenine nucleotide in the nucleus or the whole cell of the rat. During a brief period of anoxia (about ½ min), however, both regenerating and stressed livers destroy more of their ATP than the normal organ, and the change is reflected in the nuclei as well as in the whole cells. That the greater ATP breakdown already occurs before oxygen is withheld is strongly suggested by the enhanced rate of incorporation of 32P-labeled orthophosphate into the liver ATP of the treated rats. The kinetics of the changes in ATP metabolism is different in partially hepatectomized and stressed rats, and only the changes in the stressed animals are dependent upon the adrenal glands. The possibility is considered that the stimuli for the altered metabolism of ATP are causally related to the changes in the synthesis of macromolecules that characteristically follow partial hepatectomy and acute stress."

https://openalex.org/W1535850881,"Abstract The ability of acrylonitrile to cyanoethylate 13 nucleosides was examined. Only pseudouridine, inosine, and 4-thiouridine were found to react rapidly, yielding N1-cyanoethyl pseudouridine, N1-cyanoethyl inosine, and S-cyanoethyl 4-thiouridine, respectively. At much slower rates, a reaction with position N3 of uridine, ribothymidine, and N1-cyanoethyl pseudouridine was observed, and at very slow rates a 2'- (or 3'-) cyanoethyl derivative was produced with adenosine, guanosine, cytidine, and N1-cyanoethyl inosine. The variation of rate constant with pH showed that the rapidly reacting nucleosides must be in the anionic form for reaction to occur. The spectral, chromatographic, and electrophoretic properties of the derivatives were determined and used to assign the structures as given. The stability of the cyanoethyl derivatives to alkali and acid was examined and found to be sufficient to allow the application of standard procedures for the detailed nucleotide analysis of cyanoethylated transfer RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1485237163,"Abstract Aspartokinase, partially purified from extracts of Bacillus polymyxa, is inhibited by combinations of l-threonine and l-lysine at concentrations below 1 mm and by the amino acids separately at much higher concentrations. At 25°, the presence of the feedback inhibitors leads only to a decrease in the maximal velocity of the aspartokinase reaction. However, at 37° the affinity for l-aspartate is also markedly reduced by the inhibitors. Sigmoid substrate kinetics are not observed under any conditions. At 37°, but not at 25°, the apparent Km for l-aspartate is highly dependent on enzyme concentration, increasing from 0.4 mm to about 50 mm as the enzyme concentration is decreased from 13.4 to 0.17 units per ml. At 25°, the apparent Km for l-aspartate remains constant at about 1.5 mm over the same range of enzyme concentration. The presence of dioxane also leads to an increase in the apparent Km for l-aspartate, but at 25°, higher concentrations of the solvent are required to exert an effect than at 37°. It is suggested that at 37°, but not at 25°, the active form of aspartokinase dissociates into lower molecular weight units which have a markedly lower affinity for l-aspartate than the native enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1528895720,"Abstract A basic protein has been isolated from pig brain.

All of the fractions obtained by this purification procedure have been examined by starch gel electrophoresis. The homogeneity of the pig brain basic protein has been established by ultracentrifugation, starch gel electrophoresis, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and end group analysis. Amino acid analysis performed on a complete acid hydrolysate of the protein indicated that the ratio of basic to acidic amino acids is greater than 1.5.

https://openalex.org/W1481261776,"Abstract An adenosine 5'-triphosphate:hexose 6-phosphotransferase (hexokinase) specific for d-mannose and d-fructose is described. It was purified to apparent homogeneity from extracts of Leuconostoc mesenteroides. The purified enzyme had a specific activity of 76 units (micromoles per minute) per mg and a molecular weight estimated at 47,000. It was stable to storage at 0° in 0.2 m (NH4)2SO4, pH 7.0. d-Mannose and d-fructose were phosphorylated at equal rates, whereas d-glucose, 2-deoxy-d-mannose, and 28 other sugars and related compounds tested were not phosphorylated and did not inhibit the enzyme. Phosphorylation of d-fructose was competitive with d-mannose (Ki = 0.4 mm). The apparent Km for d-mannose and d-fructose was 0.4 mm and was independent of the ATP concentration. The apparent Km for ATP ranged from 0.1 to 2 mm and varied with pH and the hexose, but it was independent of the hexose concentration. Product inhibition occurred with ADP (competitive with ATP, Ki = 0.3 mm at pH 6.9) but not with d-fructose 6-phosphate. At 3.3 mm concentrations, inosine 5'-triphosphate and thymidine 5'-triphosphate served as phosphoryl donors for d-fructose at 75% and 62%, respectively, of the rate obtained with ATP. The pH-activity curves were different for the two hexoses, with the d-fructokinase to d-mannokinase activity ratios being about 1.0 at pH 6.9, 0.5 at pH 8.5, and 0.3 at pH 8.9. The products of the phosphorylation of d-mannose and d-fructose were identified as d-mannose 6-phosphate and d-fructose 6-phosphate, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1591659746,"Abstract The incorporation of water oxygen into ATP during photophosphorylation by chloroplasts varies from l0.5 to g1.0 atom of oxygen per mole of ATP formed. The ATP ⇄ HOH exchange, particularly in the presence of ascorbate and phenazine methosulfate or ferricyanide, is accompanied by small but significant Pi ⇄ HOH and Pi ⇄ ATP exchanges. The results are compatible with all exchanges occurring as a result of dynamic reversal of ATP formation at the catalytic site. Such interpretation is supported by ATP acceleration of a light-dependent Pi ⇄ HOH exchange, and can be rationalized with Pi and ADP inhibitory effects on the ATP ⇄ HOH exchange. Mg++ in excess of the ATP concentration is required for maximal ATP ⇄ HOH exchange. A small Pi ⇄ HOH exchange as well as a more prominent ATP ⇄ HOH exchange accompanies ATP synthesis in the dark resulting from an acid-base transition of chloroplasts."

https://openalex.org/W1573659757,"Abstract Aspergillus oryzae α-amylase (Taka-amylase A) is a protein which contains four disulfide bonds, one free sulfhydryl group, and 1 essential atom of calcium per molecule. Full reduction in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetate and 8 m urea results in complete loss of enzymic activity. If Ca++ is present, reoxidation at pH 8.6 leads to full recovery of activity with a parallel decrease of free sulfhydryl groups to about one per molecule of protein. However, reoxidation in the absence of Ca++ leads to an inactive protein which contains about three sulfhydryl groups per molecule. Upon the addition of Ca++, this partially reoxidized product is fully reactivated, and the number of sulfhydryl groups again falls to about one per molecule. Reoxidation of unfolded Taka-amylase in the presence of dehydroascorbic acid also leads to rapid decrease in the number of free sulfhydryl groups to about one per molecule. The resulting material is inactive, but the addition of Ca++ results in almost complete restoration of activity. The disulfide bond-containing peptides formed during the reoxidation of reduced Taka-amylase under these various conditions have been located on two-dimensional tryptic peptide maps and on diagonal performic acid-treated peptic peptide patterns. Partially reoxidized, Ca++-free amylase forms three normally paired disulfide bonds, and the addition of Ca++ results in the appearance of the fourth disulfide bond. Dehydroascorbic acid causes all four normally paired disulfide bonds to form, and subsequent activation with Ca++ does not appear to involve disulfide interchange. The Ca++-induced formation of the one remaining disulfide bond in partially reoxidized Taka-amylase is accompanied by time-dependent changes in protein conformation, as detected by ultraviolet difference, solvent perturbation, and fluorescence spectroscopy. The development of a difference spectrum at 286 mµ following the addition of Ca++ closely parallels the recovery of enzymic activity and the loss of the two excess sulfhydryl groups. In addition, the decrease in the number of solvent-accessible chromophores and the loss of the tyrosine fluorescence peak indicate that Ca++ causes conformational transitions involving major portions of the molecule. We conclude that under normal conditions Ca++ is required for full reoxidation and proper folding of reoxidized Taka-amylase, but that Ca++ does not play a role in directing normal pairing of half-cystine residues."
https://openalex.org/W1620181822,"The effect of concentration of Ca++ and mitochondria on the stoichiometry of H+ release associated with Ca++ uptake supported by succinate oxidation was examined. Ratios less than unity were observed with low concentrations of Ca++, and higher ratios were obtained with intermediate concentrations of Ca++. The highest values (greater than unity but less than 2) could be obtained with increased mitochondrial concentrations. The concentrations of Ca++ at which the highest ratios were obtained were shifted to higher levels as the mitochondrial concentration was raised. The low ratios observed with low levels of divalent cations are attributed in part to the metabolism-independent binding of Ca++, since 45Ca++ was observed to be bound by mitochondria in the presence of antimycin and oligomycin. This energy-independent uptake of Ca++ was also dependent on the concentration of Ca++ and mitochondrial protein. In contrast to the energy-dependent process, the release of H+ was small or absent when antimycin was present. Added NaCl or KCl, but not further additions of mannitol or sucrose, completed for this Ca++-accessible space. These findings suggested that H+:Ca++ ratios of unity may be underestimated, and those ratios which are based on the assumption that all of the added calcium ions are taken up by an energy-linked mechanism may have to be corrected. Under conditions where the ratio was corrected for the energy-independent binding of Ca++, the (K+ + H+):Ca++ ratio approached 2."

Its iodine content is one-tenth that found in thyroglobulin (19 S) obtained from the same preparation. It has been shown that this naturally occurring thyroid protein is not derived from and does not dimerize to 19 S thyroglobulin. While it does not interchange with undissociated 19 S, it combines with the 12 S subunits derived from 19 S to form hybrid molecules of thyroglobulin. It is inferred from the hybridization experiments that thyroglobulin consists of two different 12 S subunits, one of them being equivalent to the naturally occurring 12 S molecule."

This was the case over a wide range of pH and under conditions which would have readily permitted the detection of 0.01% equilibration of either product into the substrate. A preliminary report of such incorporation (1) is shown to have been artifactual and dependent upon the presence of radioactive impurities in the labeled materials used. These results are consistent with a concerted mechanism and are inconsistent with any mechanism involving the reversible formation of purinyl-enzyme or chloro-enzyme intermediates.
