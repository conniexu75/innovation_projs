https://openalex.org/W2082047115,"The polypeptides synthesized in E. coli minicells from recombinant plasmids containing DNA fragments from cauliflower mosaic virus, Drosophila melanogaster, and mouse mitochondria were examined. Molecularly cloned fragments of cauliflower mosaic virus DNA directed the synthesis of high levels of three polypeptides, which were synthesized entirely from within the cloned virus DNA fragments independent of their insertion into the plasmid vehicles. Several fragments of D. melanogaster DNA were capable of initiating polypeptide synthesis; however, termination of these polypeptides was dependent upon the insertion into the plasmid vehicle. The majority of D. melanogaster DNA fragments examined did not direct the detectable synthesis of any polypeptides. Insertion of DNA into the Eco RI site of ColE1 and pSC101 plasmids resulted in the altered expression of plasmid-encoded polypeptides. In the case of ColE1, this site of insertion lies within the colicin E1 structural gene, and insertion of foreign DNA into the site results in the synthesis of an inactive truncated colicin E1 molecule. It is probable that the Eco RI site in pSC101 lies within the structural gene for a polypeptide involved in tetracycline resistance, and insertion of DNA into this site may also result in the synthesis of a truncated or elongated polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W2060652120,"The genes coding for the large rRNAs (rDNA) were purified from Drosophila melanogaster embryos by two different methods. Purified rDNA was analyzed by gel electrophoresis after digestion with restriction endonucleases and by electron microscopy. Each repeating unit of rDNA consists of a gene region that codes for a transcript which includes the 18S and 28S rRNA sequences plus a nontrascribed spacer. Analysis of rRNA/rDNA hybrids in the electron microscope reveals that two types of repeating units exist in the rDNA from this fly. One of these is characterized by insertions of various lengths within the 28S gene. Insertions range in size from about 0.5 kilo base pairs (kb) to 6.0 kb and occur in distinct size classes which are multiples of 0.5 kb. Figure 10 summarizes the structure of the rDNA repeating unit. Repeats with insertions constitute about two thirds, and repeats without insertions about one third of all repeating units in the sample studied where 86% of the rDNA is derived from the X chromosome nucleolus organizer. Statistical analysis of pairs of of nearest-neighbor repeats demonstrates that repeats with and without insertions are interspersed in the X chromosome nucleolus organizer, and that scrambling is close to that expected for random arrangement. Insertions are the major source of length heterogeneity in this rDNA. A minor length heterogeneity also exists in thie nontranscribed spacer of Drosophila rDNA as demonstrated by heteroduplex mapping of restriction fragments in the electron microscope."
https://openalex.org/W1965214801,"Cleavage of D. melanogaster rDNA with the Eco R1 restriction endonuclease reveals two major classes of repeating units: a long class of 17 kilobases (kb) and a short class of 11.4 kb. R loop mapping has been used to determine the topography of the sequences corresponding to the 18S and 28S rRNAs in both classes, including a cloned member (Dm103) of the long class. This mapping procedure derives from a novel reaction that we discovered between single-stranded RNA and homologous regions in duplex DNA molecules. In high formamide and at an elevated temperature, the RNA pairs with one of the two DNA strands in the region of homology to form an R loop in which one element is an RNA/DNA duplex and the other is single-stranded DNA (Figure 1). Mapping is accomplished by visualization of R loops in the electron microscope. The R loop map of Dm103 parallels that determined independently by Glover and Hogness (1977) from an analysis of its restriction fragments. Both maps indicate that the 28S rDNA in this cloned unit is divided into two blocks by a 5 kb insertion segment. R loop mapping of a population of long units obtained directly from the rDNA (that is, without cloning) has demonstrated that this interruption of the sequence coding for the 28S rRNA is a characteristic of the long class. By contrast, the 28S rDNA in the short units that we examined is not interrupted by an insertion segment. Otherwise, the R loop maps of the long and short units do not differ significantly. The two classes therefore correspond to repeating units that do (IN+) or do not (IN-) contain an insertion segment. Models for the transcription and function of these two classes of repeating units are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1968353273,"The sequences corresponding to the 18S and 28S rRNAs have been mapped within a cloned 17 kilobase (kb) fragment formed by Eco R1 cleavage of Drosophila melanogaster rDNA. This fragment, Dm103, represents the longer of two major types of repeating units that are present in the rDNA of this fly, and was cloned as a hybrid plasmid, pDm103, consisting of Dm103 inserted at the Eco R1 site of the pSC101 vector (Glover et al., 1975). Mapping of the 18S and 28S rDNA in Dm103 was accomplished by quantitative determination of the amount of these rDNAs in each member of an ordered set of restriction fragments obtained by Hind III and Eco R1 ccleavage of pDm103. The amounts of 18S and 28S rDNAs were determined by hybridization of the rRNAs to fragments that were purified by cloning, and an unambiguous order of the fragments within pDm103 was established by heteroduplex mapping and from the stoichiometry of the fragment lengths. The resulting map revealed that the 4 kb of 28S rDNA within the long repeating unit represented by Dm103 is divided into two blocks that are separated by 5.4 kb of DNA of unknown function. It is this unusual arrangement of the 28S rDNA that distinguishes the long repeating units (17 kb) from the short units (11.5) kb), whose 4 kb of 28S rDna is confined to a single block, as is shown in the accompanying paper (White and Hogness, 1977). The remainder of the DNA in this long unit appears to be typically arranged, with the 2 kb of 18S rDNA confined to a single block that is separated by about 1 kb from the closest block of 28S rDNA."
https://openalex.org/W1990311204,"Addition of hydrogen peroxide to seawater causes synchronous spawning in gravid male and female abalones, and certain other mollusks as well. This effect is blocked by exposure of the animals to aspirin, an inhibitor of the enzyme catalyzing oxidative synthesis of prostaglandin endoperoxide. Hydrogen peroxide activates this enzymatic reaction in cell-free extracts prepared from abalone eggs (a very rich source of the prostaglandin endoperoxide synthetase); this effect appears to reveal a fundamental property of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthesis. Applicability of these findings to both mariculture and medical purposes is suggested."

https://openalex.org/W2031342495,"The sequence arrangement of genes coding for stable rRNA species and of the interspersed spacers on long single strands of rDNA purified from total chromosomal DNA of Drosophila melanogaster has been determined by a study of the structure of rRNA:DNA hybrids which were mounted for electron microscope observation by the gene 32-ethidium bromide technique. One repeat unit contains the following sequences in the order given. First, an 18S gene of length 2.13 ± 0.17 kb. Second, an internal transcribed spacer (Spl) of length 1.58 ± 0.15 kb. A short sequence coding for the 5.8S and perhaps the 2S rRNA species is located within this spacer. Third, the 28S gene with a length of 4.36 ± 0.23 kb. About 55% of the 28S genes are unbroken or continuous (C genes). However, about 45% of the 28S genes contain an insertion of an additional segment of DNA that is not complementary to rRNA (I genes). The insertion occurs at a reproducible point 2.99 ± 0.26 kb from the junction with Spl. The insertions are heterogeneous in length and occur in three broad size classes: 1.42 ± 0.47, 3.97 ± 0.55, and 6.59 ± 0.62 kb. Fourth, an external spacer between the 28S gene and the next 18S gene which is presumably mainly nontranscribed and which has a heterogeneous length distribution with a mean length and standard deviation of 5.67 ± 1.92 kb. Short inverted repeat stems (100–400 nucleotide pairs) occur at the base of the insertion. It is known from other studies that I genes occur only on the X chromosome. The present study shows that the I and C genes on the X chromosome are approximately randomly assorted. The sequence arrangement on the plasmid pDm103 containing one repeat of rDNA (Glover et al., 1975) has been determined by similar methods. The I gene on this plasmid contains an inverted repeat stem. The occurrence of inverted repeat sequences flanking the insertion supports the speculation that these sequences are translocatable elements similar to procaryotic translocons."

A P-388 active compound, debromoaplysiatoxin, has been isolated from Lyngbya gracilis and characterized.

This angiogenic capacity is a property of carcinomas but not of the resting mammary gland. In mouse papillary hyperplasias, however, this property appears much earlier than any morphological or clinical sign of carcinoma. A test for angiogenic capacity may reveal a step in the progression toward clinical malignancy and thus could be used to screen for neoplastic potential of hyperplastic epithelium in biopsy tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1565404266,"The middle part of the heavy chain of IgG3 (hinge region) which covalently links the two gamma3 chains to each other, is about 4 times larger than the same region in the three other human IgG subclasses. This is probably due to a quadruplication of a 45-nucleotide DNA segment resulting in a gamma3 hinge region which is 62 amino acid residues long and consists of an NH2-terminal 17-residue segment followed by a 15-residue segment which is identically and consecutively repeated three times. The NH2-terminal 17-residue segment shows 70% homology with the repetitive 15-residue segment and appears to be the result of a small insertion and several point mutations of the same 45-nucleotide DNA stretch. Since this unit of repetition shows 60 to 70% homology with the hinge of the other IgG subclasses, it may represent the primitive IgG hinge."
https://openalex.org/W2061852471,"Basal bodies, purified from Chlamydomonas and Tetrahymena, were exposed to various enzymatic treatments and then assayed for their ability to nucleate aster formation upon injection into eggs of Xenopus laevis. Untreated basal bodies injected into frog eggs act as centrioles and induce the formation of asters. The aster-inducing activity of basal bodies was eliminated by treatment with proteolytic enzymes and ribonucleases. Aster-inducing activity was not affected by DNAse and a number of other enzymes. The effect of proteolytic digestion on aster-inducing activity appeared to be directly correlated with the degree of structural damage to the basal body. Low concentrations of pancreatic ribonuclease A, ribonuclease T1, and S1 nuclease also completely abolished aster-inducing activity, although these enzymes had no effect on basal body structure. Ribonuclease-treated basal bodies remained capable of supporting microtubule elongation in vitro. Preliminary evidence indicates that basal bodies from Chlamydomonas and Tetrahymena contain about 5 x 10(-16) g of RNA which co-band with basal bodies and aster-inducing activity by equilibrium density gradient sedimentation. We conclude first, that centrioles contain RNA which is required for initiation of aster formation, and second, that the centriole activity or ability to assemble a mitotic aster is separable from the basal body activity, or ability to serve directly as a template for microtubule growth."
https://openalex.org/W1971642219,"Unilateral local cooling in the region of the globus pallidus of Cebus monkeys produced a severe breakdown in the performance of learned flexion-extension elbow movements when animals had no visual information about arm position but not when such information was displayed to them. This result indicates that visual information enables an animal to compensate to a large degree for the motor disorder produced by globus pallidus dysfunction, and it may explain why some previous workers have failed to see motor impairments in monkeys with lesions in the globus pallidus who were observed in their cages."
https://openalex.org/W2001070252,"Hybrid plasmid molecules containing tandemly repeated Drosophila satellite DNA were constructed using a modification of the (dA)·(dT) homopolymer procedure of Lobban and Kaiser, 1973 Lobban P.E. Kaiser A.D. Enzymatic end-to-end joining of DNA molecules. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 78: 453-471 Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar . Recombinant plasmids recovered after transformation of recA bacteria contained 10% of the amount of satellite DNA present in the transforming molecules. The cloned plasmids were not homogeneous in size. Recombinant plasmids isolated from a single colony contained populations of circular molecules which varied both in the length of the satellite region and in the poly(dA)·(dT) regions linking satellite and vector. While subcloning reduced the heterogeneity of these plasmid populations, continued cell growth caused further variations in the size of the repeated regions. Two different simple sequence satellites of Drosophila melanogaster (1.672 and 1.705 g/cm3) were unstable in both recA and recBC hosts and in both pSC101 and pCR1 vectors. We propose that this recA-independent instability of tandemly repeated sequences is due to unequal intramolecular recombination events in replicating DNA molecules, a mechanism analogous to sister chromatid exchange in eucaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1997741012,"Angiotensin II, injected into the dorsal neostriatum of rats 5 minutes after they had learned a passive avoidance task, disrupted the retention of the task 24 hours later. Identical neostriatal injections given 22 hours after learning (2 hours before retention) were without effect on retention performance. Ventral neostriatum or posterior thalamus were ineffective sites for injection of angiotensin. Injection of thyrotropin releasing hormone or lysine-8-vasopressin into the dorsal neostriatum was ineffective. These findings indicate a possible role for endogenous angiotensin in the neostriatum on retention performance and suggest potential involvement in mnemonic processes."

https://openalex.org/W1568701525,"Dilution at 0 degrees of rat liver cytosol incubated with [3H]triamcinolone acetonide provoked an enhanced binding of steroid-receptor complexes to nuclei. The explanation of this phenomenon was found to be an of the complexes. Dilution acted by decreasing the concentration of a cytosol inhibitor. This reaction was irreversible at 0 degrees: once activated the complexes could not be reversed to the nonactivated state by the addition of inhibitor. The presence of hormone was necessary, since hormone-free receptor molecules could not be activated by dilution. Removal of the inhibitor did not lead to activation of all complexes: after 24 h a plateau was attained where 55 to 70% of the complexes were activated. The inhibitor was shown to be a low molecular weight molecule by dialysis, Sephadex G-25 chromatography, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and ultrafiltration. Thus [3H]triamcinolone acetonide-receptor complexes present in a cytosol from which the inhibitor had been removed by Sephadex G-25 chromatography became spontaneously activated at low ionic strength and at 0 degrees. The inhibitor is not a steroid (at least of usual polarity) since it cannot be extracted by methylene chloride or adsorbed by activated charcoal. It is thermostable (resists to 30 min at 100 degrees). Its removal by incubation with a cation exchange resin suggests that it may be positively charged, however it is not complexed by EDTA. This inhibitor must be distinguished from a previously described inhibitor of steroid-receptor complexes binding to nuclei. The latter compound has been shown in various systems to be responsible for an artifactual saturation of nuclear acceptor by steroid-receptor complexes. It inhibits the binding to nuclear acceptors of already activated complexes and is probably a macromolecule. It is thus different from the low molecular weight activation inhibitor described in the present paper."
https://openalex.org/W1559376536,"p-Nitrophenol conjugating activity associated with liver microsomal UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.17) was purified 150- to 200-fold from cell-free homogenates. The purification scheme included solubilization with the nonionic detergent Lubrol WX, anion exchange chromatography at pH 6.0 and 7.5, and affinity chromatography with UDP-hexanolamine Sepharose 4B. The enzyme purified as a phospholipid-protein complex and was shown to consist of a single polypeptide chain of molecular weight 59,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Amino acid analysis indicated approximately 531 mol of amino acids/59,000 g of enzyme and a molar ratio of nonpolar to polar residues of 1.08. During fractionation, the enzyme displayed instability with such steps as gel filtration, dialysis, or ultrafiltration of dilute samples; however, upon adsorption to ion exchange resins or storage in concentrated form, the enzyme was reasonably stable. The active lipoprotein complex showed both size and charge heterogeneity as judged by gel filtration and electrofocusing. Three forms of the enzyme resolved by isoelectric focusing had isoelectric points which averaged pH 6.68, 6.56, and 6.31. Polypeptide compositions of these electrophoretically distinct phospholipid protein complexes were indistinguishable on the basis of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacryl-amide gel electrophoresis, suggesting that the charge heterogeneity may be the result of differences in the phospholipid content of the lipoprotein complex."

Frequencies of conjugal transfer were similar into diverse recipients (other gonococci, Neisseria flava, and Escherichia coli), which suggests that gonococci may transfer the plasmid promiscuously in nature."
https://openalex.org/W1569887733,"The effects of the ionophore, X537A, and caffeine on ATP-dependent calcium transport by fragmented sarcoplasmic reticulum were studied in the absence (calcium storage) or presence (calcium uptake) of calcium-precipitating anions. The ionophore caused rapid calcium release after calcium storage, the final level of calcium storage being the same whether a given concentration of X537A was added prior to initiation of the reaction or after calcium storage had reached a steady state. Although 10 to 12 muM X537A caused approximately 90% inhibition of oxalate-supported calcium uptake when added prior to the start of the reaction, this ionophore concentration caused only a small calcium release when added after a calcium oxalate precipitate had formed within the vesicles, and only slight inhibition of calcium uptake velocity when added during the calcium uptake reaction. When low initial calcium loads limited calcium uptake to 0.4 mumol of calcium/mg of protein, subsequent calcium additions in the absence of the ionophore led to renewed calcium uptake. Uptake of the subsequent calcium additions was not significantly inhibited by 10 to 12 muM X537A. These phenomena are most readily understood in terms of constraints imposed by fixed Cai (calcium ion concentration inside the vesicles) on the pump-leak situation in sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles containing a large amount of an insoluble calcium precipitate, where most of the calcium is within the vesicles and Cai is maintained at a relatively low level. These constraints restrict calcium loss after calcium permeability is increased because calcium release can end when the calcium pump is stimulated by the increased Cao (calcium concentration outside the vesicles) so as to compensate for the increased efflux rate. In contrast, an increased permeability in vesicles that have stored calcium in the absence of a calcium-precipitating ion causes a much larger portion of the internal calcium store to be released. Under these conditions calcium storage capacity is low so that release of stored calcium is less able to raise Cao to levels where the calcium pump can compensate for the increased efflux rate. The constraints imposed by anion-supported calcium uptake explain the finding that more calcium is released by X537A or caffeine when these agents are added at higher levels of Cao, and that more calcium leaves the vesicles in response to a given increase in calcium permeability at higher Cai. Although such calcium release is amplified by increased Cao, the amplification is attributable to the constraints described above and does not represent a calcium-triggered calcium release."
https://openalex.org/W1555599583,"A particulate enzyme preparation prepared from the intimal layer of pig aorta catalyzed the transfer of mannose from mannosyl-phosphoryl-polyprenol (MPP) into a series of oligosaccharides that were linked to lipid. The reaction required detergent with Triton X-100 and NP-40 being best at a concentration of 0.5%. Several other detergents were inactive or only slightly active. The pH optima for this activity was about 7 to 7.5 in Tris buffer and the apparent Km for MPP was about 2 x 10(-7) M. The reaction was not stimulated by the addition of divalent cation and, in fact, was inhibited by the high concentrations of cation. The addition of EDTA did not inhibit the transfer of mannose from MPP and was somewhat stimulatory. The transferase(s) activity was from the particles by treatment with Triton X-100. This solubilized enzyme still formed a series of lipid-linked oligosaccharides from either MPP or GDP-mannose. The oligosaccharides were released from the lipid by mild acid hydrolysis and were separated by paper chromatography. Some five or six radioactive oligosaccharides were formed from either MPP or from GDP-mannose and these oligosaccharides had similar mobilities upon paper chromatography. However, MPP was a better donor for the larger oligosaccharides (i.e. those containing 8, 9, or 10 sugar residues), whereas GDP-mannose was better for formation of the oligosaccharide containing 7 sugar residues. In the presence of EDTA and detergent no MPP was formed from GDP-mannose, but radioactivity was still incorporated into the lipid-linked oligosaccharides. Under these conditions essentially all of the radioactivity was in the oligosaccharide containing 7 sugar residues. Since much of this activity could be released as mannose by acetolysis, GDP-mannose may be the direct mannosyl donor for formation of 1 leads to 6 branches. Oligosaccharides 7, 8, 9, and 10 were isolated and partially characterized in terms of their molecular weights, sugar composition, susceptibility to alpha-mannosidase, and 14C products formed by acetolysis and periodate oxidation. The molecular weights ranged from 1310 for oligosaccharide 7 to 1750 for oligosaccharide 10. Hydrolysis of each oligosaccharide and reduction with NaB3H4 gave the expected ratio of [3H]hexitol to [3H]hexosaminitol based on the molecular weight of the oligosaccharide. However, the hexitol fraction contained [3H]mannitol and [3H]glucitol. Since the amount of radioactivity in glucitol was 2 to 4 times that in mannitol and since only glucosaminitol was found in the amino sugar peak, it seems likely that each 14C-oligosaccharide was contaminated with an unlabeled oligosaccharide of equal molecular weight containing glucose and GlcNAc. Acetolysis of the 14C-oligosaccharides gave rise to 14C peaks of mannose, mannobiose, and mannotriose. In the larger oligosaccharides, most of the radioactivity was in mannobiose whereas in oligosaccharide 7 most of the radioactivity was in mannose..."

A specific antibody was produced toward the major form of the cytochrome. The antibody inhibits microsomal acetanilide hydroxylation (80%). It does not cross-react with the minor fraction of the cytochrome or inhibit the hydroxylation of 3,4-benzpyrene or coumarin, the N-demethylation of aminopyrine or the O-deethylation of 7-ethoxycoumarin catalyzed by rabbit liver microsomes. The major form has an estimated Mr = 54,000 and displays an n-octylamine difference spectrum with an absorption maximum at 426 nm and a minimum at 391 nm. When reconstituted, this cytochrome catalyzes acetanilide hydroxylation at a higher rate than microsomes or the minor fraction. The n-octylamine difference spectrum of the minor fraction displays an absorption maximum at 431 nm and a minimum at 410 nm. When reconstituted, this fraction catalyzes the hydroxylation of 3,4-benzpyrene and the O-deethylation of 7-ethoxycoumarin. The two cytochromes appear to be distinct entities and function in different catalytic pathways."

Our results indicate that glycophospholipid participates in the mannosylation of the viral proteins since an inhibitor of oligosaccharide-lipid synthesis also inhibits the labeling of the glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W2407028524,"Abstract The ability of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles to retain calcium following ATP-supported calcium uptake in the presence of the calcium-precipitating anions oxalate and phosphate depends on Cao (calcium ion concentration outside the vesicles) and Cai (calcium ion concentration within the vesicles). Calcium efflux rates at any level of Cai are accelerated when Cao is increased. Higher Cao at the time that calcium uptake reactions reach steady state is associated with a spontaneous calcium release that reflects this effect of increased Cao. Increasing Cai at any level of Cao causes little or no acceleration of calcium efflux rate so that calcium permeability coefficients, estimated by dividing calcium efflux rates by Cai, the driving force, are inversely proportional to Cai. Calcium permability coefficients thus correlate, as a first approximation, with the ratio Cai/Cao, decreasing 1000-fold as this ratio increases over a 3000-fold range (Cao = 0.1 to 3.3 muM, Cai =4 to 750 muM). Oscillations in both the calcium content of the vesicles and Cao are seen as calcium uptake reactions approach steady state, suggesting that calcium permeability undergoes time-dependent variations. Sudden reduction of Cao to levels that markedly inhibit calcium influx via the calcium pump unmasks a calcium efflux that decreases slowly over 60 to 90 s.The maximal calcium permeability observed in the present study would allow the calcium efflux rate from the sarcoplasmic reticulum at a Cai of 100 muM to be approximately 10(-10) mol/cm2/s, which is about 1 order of magnitude less than that estimated for the sarcoplasmic reticulum of activated skeletal muscle in vivo. The release of most of the stored calcium in some experiments indicates that the observed permeability changes can occur over a large portion of the surface of the sarcoplasmic reticulum."

At this time, however, visual discrimination performance in the 85-microgram group was impaired under dim light relative both to their own performance under bright light and to the performance of the other groups under all light levels used. We interpret these results to reflect a deleterious, enduring impairment of scotopic visual function (night blindness) as a result of early lead intoxication."

https://openalex.org/W1506213581,"D-Vinylglycine (2-amino-3-butenoate) functions as a transamination substrate and irreversible inactivator of the homogeneous pyridoxal phosphate-dependent D-amino acid transaminases from Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus sphaericus. In the absence of alpha-ketoglutarate as co-substrate, vinyl-glycine causes little if any inactivation of either enzyme; in the presence of excess alpha-ketoglutarate, both enzymes are inactivated with pseudo-first order kinetics. The limiting rate constant for inactivation of the B. sphaericus enzyme is 1.9 min-1, for the B. subilis enzyme it is 0.36 min-1. The number of catalytic events before inactivation is about 450 for the B. sphaericus enzyme and about 800 for the B. subtilis enzyme; that is, about 0.2% inactivation in each catalytic cycle for the former enzyme and 0.15% for the latter. Comparisons are made with the L-aspartate amino-transferase from pig heart which is inactivated completely in one catalytic cycle and the L-alanine aminotransferase which is not inactivated in many cycles. Comparisons are also made between the likely mode of D-transaminase inactivation produced by vinylglycine and the mode of inactivation induced by beta-chloro-D-alanine."
https://openalex.org/W1495836317,"The biosynthesis and secretion of a glycosylated, K-type immunoglobulin light chain (K-46) was studied in a mouse myeloma tumor, mineral oil plasmacytoma-46B. Viable single cell suspensions were prepared from excised tumors and optimal conditions were established for incorporation of amino acid and carbohydrate precursors into the protein synthesized and secreted by the cells. The glucose analog, 2-deoxy-D-glucose, was utilized as an inhibitor of glycosylation to determine the role of glycosylation in the biosynthesis, intracellular transport, and export of the protein from the cell. It was determined that 6 mM 2-deoxyglucose prevents the incorporation of glucosamine, mannose, and galactose into secreted protein, but permits the incorporation of leucine at approximately 40% of control values. The nonglycosylated protein, secreted in the presence of 2-deoxyglucose, was characterized as a nonglycosylated form of K-46 light chain by the following criteria: (a) electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate, (b) reactivity of the nonglycosylated protein with antisera prepared against native, fully glycosylated, K-46 light chain, (c) analysis of the protein by gel filtration techniques, (d) behavior of the protein on lectin-derivatized Sepharose, and (e) analysis of tryptic peptides derived from the protein. We have concluded that 2-deoxyglucose-inhibited cells synthesize and secrete the normal polypeptide chain of K-46 devoid of its carbohydrate side chain indicating that glycosylation is not an essential step in the biosynthesis, intracellular transport, or export of this protein that is normally synthesized and secreted in a glycosylated form. Under conditions of 2-deoxyglucose inhibition, the nonglycosylated form of K-46 light chain constitutes a significantly greater proportion of accumulated intracellular protein, suggesting that the biosynthesis of the polypeptide chain of K-46 light chain proceeds at a nearly normal rate, but that the absence of the carbohydrate side chain of the protein retards, but does not prevent, the intracellular transport of the protein and its export from the tumor cell."
https://openalex.org/W1483456888,"Data are presented on the partial purification and properties of a 5 S ribosomal RNA maturation nuclease, termed RNase M5, from Bacillus subtillis 168. RNase M5 specifically cleaves 21 and 42 nucleotides, respectively, from the 5' and 3' termini of a 5 S rRNA precursor to yield the mature (116 nucleotides) 5 S rRNA. The cleavage is endonucleolytic with the formation of 5'-phosphoryl and 3'-hydroxyl groups. Enzyme action requires divalent cations, which may be furnished by either certain metals or by polyamines. The activity is separable into two components both of which are required for activity. It appears that the same nuclease excises the 5'- and 3'-terminal segments since preparations lose the capacity to modify the two termini with an identical first order thermal decay rate. Certain features of the rRNA precursor which may be involved in cognitive interaction with RNase M5 are discussed."

This report describes a primate model in which silicone catheters are placed into the fourth ventricle and the spinal subarachnoid space and connected to subcutaneous cerebrospinal fluid reservoirs. This model permits sterile access to ventricular cerebrospinal fluid without tissue damage, provides mixing of injected drugs with lateral ventricular cerebrospinal fluid, enables spinoventricular perfusion, and permits ventricular cerebrospinal fluid sampling over extended periods in unanesthetized rhesus monkeys. This animal system may provide intraventricular pressure recordings and pharmacokinetic data similar to that obtained in man."

https://openalex.org/W1593721009,"A metabolic scheme of glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway has been constructed, assuming that the reactions occur in a single compartment. From this scheme, equations are written for a system in metabolic and isotopic steady state. These allow computation of the specific activity of every carbon atom of all the intermediates of the glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathways and consequently of the flux of carbon along each step of these pathways. A sufficiently large number of well distributed measurements of incorporation of radioactive label from different positions of several substrates into intermediates or products must be made to determine all the fluxes. This is done by choosing a set of metabolic fluxes, calculating incorporation with the aid of a computer, and then manipulating the flux rates until the computed incorporations match the data. The model is used in this paper to analyze the metabolism of the protozoan Tetrahymena pyriformis. The metabolic scheme of the model is consistent with all available information on the enzyme complement of this ciliate. Cells grown to transition phase in proteose/peptone medium were inoculated into a mixture of glucose (6 mM), fructose (6 mM), ribose (3 mM), and glycerol (3 mM) and incubated for 1 h. In each of these experiments, one of the following labeled substrates was present: [1-, 2-, 6-, or U-14C]glucose; [1- or U-14C]fructose; [1- or U-14C]ribose; [1(3)-or 2-14C]glycerol. The incorporation of label from these substrates into CO2, lipid, glycogen, and RNA was measured. In contrast to earlier studies on the metabolism of 2- and 3-carbon substrates by Tetrahymena, the rate of incorporation of label from some substrates into some products (e.g. from [1-14C]glucose into CO2) changed during the incubation. To treat these time-dependent data within the framework of the steady state model, the 1-h incubation was divided into three 20-min intervals; within each of these, the rates of incorporation were approximately constant, as required for a steady state system. Measurements of the pool sizes of glucose-6-P and fructose-6-P showed that only slow changes in pool sizes occurred after the first 5 min of incubation and indicated that the system was effectively in a metabolic and isotopic steady state throughout most of the incubation. The finding that a low concentration of cycloheximide prevented the acceleration of 14CO2 production from labeled glucose suggests a role for protein synthesis in the slow adaptation to carbohydrate addition and supports the quasi-steady state treatment of this system. The expected incorporation into each product was computed for trial sets of 1, independent flux rates. A set of flux values was found which yielded a good fit to the 29 measurements made for each interval. These flux values therefore constitute a quantitative description of temporal changes in carbon flow along the glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathways during the 1st h of adaptation to the carbohydrate mixture..."

https://openalex.org/W1554515894,The kinetics of hydrolysis and transpeptidation of the synthetic substrate diacetyl-L-lysyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine and of the natural substrate UDP-acetylmuramyl pentapeptide and related compounds catalyzed by the D-alanine carboxypeptidases of Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus stearothermophilus in the presence of the nucleophiles hydroxylamine or glycine have been examined. These kinetic data suggest that an acyl-enzyme intermediate is formed in the first step of the reaction and that the transpeptidation is the consequence of the partitioning of this intermediate between water and the nucleophile in the second step.

https://openalex.org/W1598947831,"A polysaccharide composed of 3-O-methyl-D-mannose and D-mannose in a molar ratio of approximately 10:1 and containing 3 to 4 esterified acetyl residues has been isolated from Streptomyces griseus. This acetylated methylmannose polysaccharide (AMMP) is similar to the methylmannose polysaccharide (MMP) of Mycobacterium smegmatis (Gray, G. R., and Ballou, C. E. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 6835-6842) in its size and composition, the absence of acidic or basic groups, and the lack of a reducing end. It is different, however, in its content of esterified acetyl residues, and it is slightly different in its structure and in its gel filtration properties. The structure of AMMP has been established by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and by combinations of methylation analysis and Smith degradation utilizing non-radioactively labeled polysaccharide and [3H]methyl-labeled polysaccharide obtained from cells grown in the presence of L-[methyl-3H]methionine. It is concluded that AMMP is a linear, nonreducing, neutral polysaccharide composed of a terminal D-mannose residue linked alpha(1 leads to 4) to a chain of 10 consecutive alpha(1 leads to 4)-linked 3-O-methyl-D-mannose residues. The reducing terminal 3-O-methyl-D-mannose residue exists, at least in part, as its alpha-methyl glycoside. The positions of attachment of the ester residues have not been established."

https://openalex.org/W1832246630,"The reaction of yeast tRNAVallab with NaHSO3 at 25 degrees and pH 5.8 has been studied. Six reactive residues have been located. C-17 in loop I is the most reactive (51% conversion) and C-73 in the first base pair of the acceptor stem the least reactive (8%). Three of the remaining reactive residues (C-39 in loop II, C-75 and C-76 near the acceptor stem) react to the same extent (36 to 38%) under the conditions of the experiment. C-37 in the anticodon reacted to a lesser extent (28%) than C-39 (36%), located just 2 residues away in the anticodon loop. No other changes were detected, but kinetic data suggest one or more additional residues may react very slowly. The C changed to U change in the anticodon (iac changed to iau) is a missense change (Val changed to Ile). Both mechanistic considerations and experimental data from the literature show that HSO3--induced deamination of cytosine residues occurs only at unstacked residues. We interpret the quantitative changes in tRNAVal to indicate that C-17 spends a large portion of its lifetime in an unstacked conformation. The stacking lifetimes of C-37, C-39, C-75, and C-76 seem to be similar but not identical. All other cytidine residues are much more tightly stacked. These results are consistent with the folded cloverleaf models that have been proposed from x-ray diffraction studies of yeast tRNAPhe. Residues C-46, C-49, C-57, and C-61, which are present in the single-stranded regions of the unfolded cloverleaf structure, do not react, suggesting that they are tightly stacked in solution under the conditions of this experiment. The data also suggest that anticodon-loop conformations other than the extremes with five bases stacked on either the 3' or 5' portion of the anticodon stem exist in solution and that the anticodon loop is flexible."
https://openalex.org/W1595232962,"An initiation study of mineral oil-induced plasmacytoma (MOPC) 315 heavy chain immunoglobulin (H315) in vitro has been conducted using formyl-[35S]methionyl-tRNAfMet and a highly purified 18 S message from MOPC 315 solid tumor in a crude rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. The product was specifically precipitated by antibodies directed against MOPC 315 immunoglobulin and H315. The in vitro H315 products terminally labeled with formyl-[35S]methionine or internally labeled with [3H]leucine were electrophoretically identical with in vivo H315 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. All of the [35S]-methionine was incorporated at the NH2 terminus, not internally, since there is a near complete recovery of [35S]methionine following one cycle of Edman degradation. The NH2-terminal cyanogen bromide peptide, CN2, of in vivo and in vitro H315 co-migrated exactly on gel electrophoresis under conditions which completely resolved two proteins differing in size by only 14 amino acids. These data strongly suggest that there is no NH2-terminal precursor of H315 in this system. Cyanogen bromide peptide profiles of in vivo and in vitro H315 were chromatographically indistinguishable. Three peptides, CN1, CN2, and CN4, which represent approximately 85% of the total amino acids of H315 were isolated and further characterized by electrophoresis and paper chromatography. All were very similar to the corresponding peptides of authentic H315. We conclude that the fidelity of H315 translation is preserved in vitro."
