https://openalex.org/W4211089684,"METTL16 has recently been identified as an RNA methyltransferase responsible for the deposition of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in a few transcripts. Whether METTL16 methylates a large set of transcripts, similar to METTL3 and METTL14, remains unclear. Here we show that METTL16 exerts both methyltransferase activity-dependent and -independent functions in gene regulation. In the cell nucleus, METTL16 functions as an m6A writer to deposit m6A into hundreds of its specific messenger RNA targets. In the cytosol, METTL16 promotes translation in an m6A-independent manner. More specifically, METTL16 directly interacts with the eukaryotic initiation factors 3a and -b as well as ribosomal RNA through its Mtase domain, thereby facilitating the assembly of the translation-initiation complex and promoting the translation of over 4,000 mRNA transcripts. Moreover, we demonstrate that METTL16 is critical for the tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Collectively, our studies reveal previously unappreciated dual functions of METTL16 as an m6A writer and a translation-initiation facilitator, which together contribute to its essential function in tumorigenesis. Su et al. report that while METTL16 acts as an m6A writer in the nucleus, it exerts an m6A-independent function in the cytosol, where it facilitates translation through direct interactions with ribosomal RNAs and eukaryotic initiation factors 3a and -b."
https://openalex.org/W4211113203,"Many cancers have an unusual dependence on glutamine. However, most previous studies have focused on the contribution of glutamine to metabolic building blocks and the energy supply. Here, we report that cancer cells with aberrant expression of glutamate decarboxylase 1 (GAD1) rewire glutamine metabolism for the synthesis of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)—a prominent neurotransmitter—in non-nervous tissues. An analysis of clinical samples reveals that increased GABA levels predict poor prognosis. Mechanistically, we identify a cancer-intrinsic pathway through which GABA activates the GABAB receptor to inhibit GSK-3β activity, leading to enhanced β-catenin signalling. This GABA-mediated β-catenin activation both stimulates tumour cell proliferation and suppresses CD8+ T cell intratumoural infiltration, such that targeting GAD1 or GABABR in mouse models overcomes resistance to anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Our findings uncover a signalling role for tumour-derived GABA beyond its classic function as a neurotransmitter that can be targeted pharmacologically to reverse immunosuppression."
https://openalex.org/W4211152692,"Vascular endothelial cells (ECs) form a critical interface between blood and tissues that maintains whole-body homeostasis. In COVID-19, disruption of the EC barrier results in edema, vascular inflammation, and coagulation, hallmarks of this severe disease. However, the mechanisms by which ECs are dysregulated in COVID-19 are unclear. Here, we show that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 alone activates the EC inflammatory phenotype in a manner dependent on integrin ⍺5β1 signaling. Incubation of human umbilical vein ECs with whole spike protein, its receptor-binding domain, or the integrin-binding tripeptide RGD induced the nuclear translocation of NF-κB and subsequent expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules (VCAM1 and ICAM1), coagulation factors (TF and FVIII), proinflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6), and ACE2, as well as the adhesion of peripheral blood leukocytes and hyperpermeability of the EC monolayer. In addition, inhibitors of integrin ⍺5β1 activation prevented these effects. Furthermore, these vascular effects occur in vivo, as revealed by the intravenous administration of spike, which increased expression of ICAM1, VCAM1, CD45, TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 in the lung, liver, kidney, and eye, and the intravitreal injection of spike, which disrupted the barrier function of retinal capillaries. We suggest that the spike protein, through its RGD motif in the receptor-binding domain, binds to integrin ⍺5β1 in ECs to activate the NF-κB target gene expression programs responsible for vascular leakage and leukocyte adhesion. These findings uncover a new direct action of SARS-CoV-2 on EC dysfunction and introduce integrin ⍺5β1 as a promising target for treating vascular inflammation in COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4210902500,"Totipotent cells have more robust developmental potency than any other cell types, giving rise to both embryonic and extraembryonic tissues. Stable totipotent cell cultures and deciphering the principles of totipotency regulation would be invaluable to understand cell plasticity and lineage segregation in early development. Our approach of remodeling the pericentromeric heterochromatin and re-establishing the totipotency-specific broad H3K4me3 domains promotes the pluri-to-totipotency transition. Our protocol establishes a closer match of mouse 2-cell (2C) embryos than any other 2C-like cells. These totipotent-like stem cells (TLSCs) are stable in culture and possess unique molecular features of the mouse 2C embryo. Functionally, TLSCs are competent for germline transmission and give rise to both embryonic and extraembryonic lineages at high frequency. Therefore, TLSCs represent a highly valuable cell type for studies of totipotency and embryology."
https://openalex.org/W4226412849,"The visual cortex is hierarchically organized, yet the presence of extensive recurrent and parallel pathways make it challenging to decipher how signals flow between neuronal populations. Here, we tracked the flow of spiking activity recorded from six interconnected levels of the mouse visual hierarchy. By analyzing leading and lagging spike-timing relationships among pairs of simultaneously recorded neurons, we created a cellular-scale directed network graph. Using a module-detection algorithm to cluster neurons based on shared connectivity patterns, we uncovered two multi-regional communication modules distributed across the hierarchy. The direction of signal flow both between and within these modules, differences in layer and area distributions, and distinct temporal dynamics suggest that one module transmits feedforward sensory signals, whereas the other integrates inputs for recurrent processing. These results suggest that multi-regional functional modules may be a fundamental feature of organization beyond cortical areas that supports signal propagation across hierarchical recurrent networks."
https://openalex.org/W4211114394,"Gene editing is a powerful tool for genome and cell engineering. Exemplified by CRISPR-Cas, gene editing could cause DNA damage and trigger DNA repair processes that are often error-prone. Such unwanted mutations and safety concerns can be exacerbated when altering long sequences. Here we couple microbial single-strand annealing proteins (SSAPs) with catalytically inactive dCas9 for gene editing. This cleavage-free gene editor, dCas9-SSAP, promotes the knock-in of long sequences in mammalian cells. The dCas9-SSAP editor has low on-target errors and minimal off-target effects, showing higher accuracy than canonical Cas9 methods. It is effective for inserting kilobase-scale sequences, with an efficiency of up to approximately 20% and robust performance across donor designs and cell types, including human stem cells. We show that dCas9-SSAP is less sensitive to inhibition of DNA repair enzymes than Cas9 references. We further performed truncation and aptamer engineering to minimize its size to fit into a single adeno-associated-virus vector for future application. Together, this tool opens opportunities towards safer long-sequence genome engineering."
https://openalex.org/W4211143251,"Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) is a highly invasive noctuid pest first reported in northern Australia during early 2020. To document current status of resistance in S. frugiperda in Australia, insecticide toxicity was tested in field populations collected during the first year of establishment, between March 2020 and March 2021. Dose-response was measured by larval bioassay in 11 populations of S. frugiperda and a susceptible laboratory strain of Helicoverpa armigera. Emamectin benzoate was the most efficacious insecticide (LC50 0.023μg/ml) followed by chlorantraniliprole (LC50 0.055μg/ml), spinetoram (LC50 0.098μg/ml), spinosad (LC50 0.526μg/ml), and methoxyfenozide (1.413μg/ml). Indoxacarb was the least toxic selective insecticide on S. frugiperda (LC50 3.789μg/ml). Emamectin benzoate, chlorantraniliprole and methoxyfenozide were 2- to 7-fold less toxic on S. frugiperda compared with H. armigera while spinosyns were equally toxic on both species. Indoxacarb was 28-fold less toxic on S. frugiperda compared with H. armigera. There was decreased sensitivity to Group 1 insecticides and synthetic pyrethroids in S. frugiperda compared with H. armigera: toxicity was reduced up to 11-fold for methomyl, 56 to 199-fold for cyhalothrin, and 44 to 132-fold for alpha cypermethrin. Synergism bioassays with metabolic inhibitors suggest involvement of mixed function oxidase in pyrethroid resistance. Recommended diagnostic doses for emamectin benzoate, chlorantraniliprole, spinetoram, spinosad, methoxyfenozide and indoxacarb are 0.19, 1.0, 0.75, 6, 12 and 48μg/μl, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W4211260927,"Background More than one out of every ten married women in the world, and one out of every five women in Africa, have unmet family planning needs. Despite this, studies concerning sub-Saharan Africa as well as the community-level factors that may influence the unmet need for family planning are scarce. Objective To assess factors associated with unmet need for family planning in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods This study used the nineteen demographic and health surveys (DHS) conducted between 2015 and 2020 in sub-Saharan Africa. A total weighted sample of 175, 820 women of reproductive age who were married during the survey was used for this study. To assess the factors associated with unmet need for family planning, I have employed a multilevel multinomial logistic regression model. After selecting variables using the bivariable analysis, a multivariable model was fitted. Finally, an adjusted relative risk ratio with its 95% Confidence Interval was reported and variables with a p-value less than 0.05 were declared to be significant predictors of unmet need for family planning. Result The overall prevalence of unmet need for family planning in sub-Saharan Africa was 23.70%, of which unmet need for spacing and limiting was 15.81% and 7.90% respectively. In the multivariable multilevel multinomial model, women’s age, women’s education, age at cohabitation, heard about family planning through media, parity, number of under-five children, and knowledge about modern contraceptive methods were among the individual-level factors that were associated with both the unmet need for spacing and limiting. Place of residence, community level of women illiteracy, and region were among the community-level factors that were associated with both unmet needs for spacing and limiting. Household size and visiting the health facility in the last 12 months were associated with unmet need for spacing only and husband education was associated with unmet need for limiting only. Conclusion Unmet need for family planning in sub-Saharan Africa was high. Both individual and community level factors were associated with both unmet need for spacing and limiting. Therefore, it is better to consider interventions at both individual and community levels."

https://openalex.org/W4211029138,"With the emergence of a new concept called 'Internet Gaming Disorder' in DSM-5 and ICD-11, related research is underway around the globe. However, not enough literature on Internet gaming addiction has considered the diversity in game genres. Internet gaming addiction may take on a different form according to the particular characteristics of a game being played. To better understand adolescent Internet gaming addiction, this study sought to identify the differences in Internet gaming addiction and personality characteristics based on the game genre played. A total of 3,217 elementary and middle school students across Korea participated in the survey that included the Maladaptive Game Use Scale and the Adolescent Personality Questionnaire. ANOVA analysis revealed that Internet gaming addiction and personality characteristics varied according to the game genre played. In particular, post-hoc tests showed that Real-Time Strategy (RTS) and First-Person Shooter (FPS) game users have higher levels of tolerance, withdrawal, and neglect of everyday life compared to other genres such as Role-Playing Game (RPG), Racing, and Arcade/Shooting. Also, Internet gamers users of particular genres showed significantly lower self-esteem (Arcade/Shooting), conscientiousness (Racing), empathy (RPG), and sense of community (Racing and RTS) scores than comparison group. The implications of the study results were discussed with a special emphasis on Internet gaming addiction interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4211146957,"The objective of this study is to identify how predisposing characteristics, enabling factors, and health needs are jointly and individually associated with epidemiological patterns of outpatient healthcare utilization for patients who already interact and engage with a large healthcare system.We retrospectively analyzed electronic medical record data from 1,423,166 outpatient clinic visits from 474,674 patients in a large healthcare system from June 2018-March 2019. We evaluated patients who exclusively visited rural clinics versus patients who exclusively visited urban clinics using Chi-square tests and the generalized estimating equation Poisson regression methodology. The outcome was healthcare use defined by the number of outpatient visits to clinics within the healthcare system and independent variables included age, gender, race, ethnicity, smoking status, health status, and rural or urban clinic location. Supplementary analyses were conducted observing healthcare use patterns within rural and urban clinics separately and within primary care and specialty clinics separately.Patients in rural clinics vs. urban clinics had worse health status [χ2 = 935.1, df = 3, p<0.0001]. Additionally, patients in rural clinics had lower healthcare utilization than patients in urban clinics, adjusting for age, race, ethnicity, gender, smoking, and health status [2.49 vs. 3.18 visits, RR = 0.61, 95%CI = (0.55,0.68), p<0.0001]. Further, patients in rural clinics had lower utilization for both primary care and specialty care visits.Within the large healthcare system, patients in rural clinics had lower outpatient healthcare utilization compared to their urban counterparts despite having potentially elevated health needs reflected by a higher number of unique health diagnoses documented in their electronic health records after adjusting for multiple factors. This work can inform future studies exploring the roots and ramifications of rural-urban healthcare utilization differences and rural healthcare disparities."
https://openalex.org/W4211151810,"The aim of this paper is to analize the influence of professionalization over firm's performance and the effect of two mediating variables, risk-taking and technological innovation. A total of 310 Spanish SMEs were surveyed, and the study was conducted using partial least squares path modelling (PLS-SEM) technique. The findings showed that firm's performance is influenced by professionalization, risk-taking and technological innovation. These effects are not only direct and positive, but there are also important indirect effects that reinforce the positive effects of professionalization on firm's performance. This research contributes to the literature on professionalization considering mediating effects of risk-taking and technological innovation in the relationship between professionalization and firm's performance. The results provide interesting implications for theory and practice, indicating how companies can orient their strategies with the aim of gaining competitive advantage in order to increase their performance."
https://openalex.org/W4211070872,"Previously it has been shown that fetal alcohol exposure increases the stress response partly due to lowering stress regulatory proopiomelanocortin (Pomc) gene expression in the hypothalamus via epigenetic mechanisms for multiple generations in mixed-breed rats. In this study we assess the induction of heritable epigenetic changes of Pomc-related variants by fetal alcohol exposure in isogenic Fischer 344 rats. Using transgenerational breeding models and fetal alcohol exposure procedures, we determined changes in hypothalamic Pomc gene expression and its methylation levels, plasma corticosterone hormone response to restraint stress, and anxiety-like behaviors using elevated plus maze tests in fetal alcohol-exposed offspring for multiple generations in isogenic Fischer rats. Fetal alcohol-exposed male and female rat offspring showed significant deficits in POMC neuronal functions with increased Pomc gene methylation and reduced expression. These changes in POMC neuronal functions were associated with increased plasma corticosterone response to restraint stress and increased anxiety-like behavior. These effects of fetal alcohol exposure persisted in the F1, F2, and F3 progeny of the male germline but not of the female germline. These data suggest that fetal alcohol exposure induces heritable changes in Pomc-related variants involving stress hyperresponsiveness and anxiety-like behaviors which perpetuate into subsequent generations through the male germline via epigenetic modifications."
https://openalex.org/W4211073647,"Pangenome analyses are increasingly being utilized to study the evolution of eukaryotic organisms. While pangenomes can provide insight into polymorphic gene content, inferences about the ecological and adaptive potential of such organisms also need to be accompanied by additional supportive genomic analyses. In this study we constructed a pangenome of Claviceps purpurea from 24 genomes and examined the positive selection and recombination landscape of an economically important fungal organism for pharmacology and agricultural research. Together, these analyses revealed that C. purpurea has a relatively large accessory genome (~ 38%), high recombination rates (ρ = 0.044), and transposon mediated gene duplication. However, due to observations of relatively low transposable element (TE) content (8.8%) and a lack of variability in genome sizes, prolific TE expansion may be controlled by frequent recombination. We additionally identified that within the ergoline biosynthetic cluster the lpsA1 and lpsA2 were the result of a recombination event. However, the high recombination rates observed in C. purpurea may be influencing an overall trend of purifying selection across the genome. These results showcase the use of selection and recombination landscapes to identify mechanisms contributing to pangenome structure and primary factors influencing the evolution of an organism."

Patients who were diagnosed with appendicitis and treated at the same hospital from January 1, 2019 to July 1, 2019 were designated as the control group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess changes in the severity of appendicitis (at a 2-week interval) between the two groups.We identified 307 (study group: 149; control group: 158) consecutive patients with appendicitis. The mean age was 46.2 +- 19.8 years. Between the two groups, there were no significant differences in age, sex, comorbidity, surgery type (laparoscopic or open appendectomy) or surgery time. The number of patients in the study group decreased between January 29, 2020 and April 21, 2020, which paralleled the period of spikes in the confirmed COVID-19 cases and restricted daily activities. The percentage of uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis (excluding mild appendicitis or normal appendix) in the study group increased between February 26 and March 10, as well as between April 8 and April 21. In the multivariate regression analysis, the odds of uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis increased in three bi-weeks for the study group but not in the control group.The severity of acute appendicitis might increase during the COVID-19 pandemic, because patients with mild appendicitis (or abdominal pain) may hesitate to seek help."

https://openalex.org/W4211186133,"Few reports exist regarding the expression and function of Wilms' tumor 1-associated protein (WTAP) in colorectal cancer (CRC), and the evidence is controversial. Our analysis explored the expression of WTAP in CRC tissue, and analyzed its clinical and prognostic significance. WTAP expression was significantly higher in CRC tissue than in colorectal adenoma and normal colorectal tissue. WTAP was highest in left colon tumor samples and negatively associated with tumor differentiation, as well as depth of tumor invasion. In multiple logistic regression analysis, independent predictors of WTAP expression in CRC included tumor in the left colon (odds ratio = 2.634; 95% confidence interval: 1.129-6.142; P = 0.025) and poorly differentiated tissue (0.072; 0.014-0.367; P = 0.002). No clear relationship was observed between CRC patient prognosis and WTAP expression. We suggest that WTAP expression is upregulated in CRC, highly expressed in left colon cancer and negatively correlated with tumor differentiation."

We assessed the sex-related difference on outcomes, including in-hospital mortality, all-cause mortality, aortic death, redo aortic surgery, ischemic stroke, and depression during the follow-up period. The analysis was done separately for type A and type B surgeries.On average, female patients diagnosed with AAD were older than males. There was no significant sex difference of in-hospital mortality or all-cause mortality for both type A open and type B stent surgeries. The risk of redo aortic surgery was significantly greater in males than females (7.8% vs. 4%; unadjusted subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR] 0.51, 95% CI 0.38-0.69) for type A open surgery, but not for type B stent surgery. Noticeably, the risk of newly-diagnosed depression was significantly greater in females than males (8% vs. 5.1%; unadjusted SHR 1.6, 95% CI 1.24-2.06) for type A open surgery, but not for type B stent surgery.No significant sex-related difference was found for the in-hospital mortality or accumulative all-cause mortality.

They viewed two fruit drinks labeled according to their condition, one high in sugar and one not, and completed selection tasks. Next, they assessed four products high in sugar, sodium, and/or saturated fat (""high in"" product). Finally, they selected which label would most discourage them from consuming a ""high in"" product.The nutrient warning performed better on most outcomes. Twenty percent of participants exposed to the nutrient warning would purchase the high-sugar fruit drink compared to GDA (24%, p<0.01), Nutri-Score (33%, p<0.001), and no label (29%, p<0.001). GDA performed slightly better than the nutrient warning in identifying the high-sugar fruit drink (91% vs 88%, p<0.001). The nutrient warning best helped participants correctly identify other ""high in"" products (75% vs. 23% no-label, 26% Nutri-Score, and 43% GDA, all p<0.001) and had the highest perceived message effectiveness (3.86 on 5-point scale vs. 2.97 GDA and 2.70 Nutri-Score, both p<0.001) and lowest likelihood of purchasing ""high in"" products (2.58 on 5-point scale vs. 3.23 GDA, 3.49 Nutri-Score, and 3.51 no label, all p<0.001). The nutrient warning most discouraged participants from wanting to consume ""high in"" products.Nutrient warnings are a promising policy to help consumers identify and discourage consumption of products high in nutrients of concern.Trial Registration: NCT04567004."
https://openalex.org/W4210828052,"Lon protease is a conserved ATP-dependent serine protease composed of an AAA+ domain that mechanically unfolds substrates and a serine protease domain that degrades these unfolded substrates. In yeast, dysregulation of Lon protease (PIM1) attenuates lifespan and leads to gross mitochondrial morphological perturbations.

Protein homeostasis (proteostasis)—the dynamic balancing of protein composition in a cell—must be tightly controlled for cellular function and longevity (1Balch W.E. Morimoto R.I. Dillin A. Kelly J.W. Adapting proteostasis for disease intervention.Science. 2008; 319: 916-919Google Scholar). As the hub of bioenergetic processes, mitochondria have an array of mechanisms to maintain proteostasis, one of which comprises proteases that site-selectively cleave substrates or degrade misfolded proteins (2Moehle E.A. Shen K. Dillin A. Mitochondrial proteostasis in the context of cellular and organismal health and aging.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 5396-5407Google Scholar). These proteases acutely manage stress and prevent the accumulation of potentially toxic misfolded and aggregated proteins. However, as organisms age, the mechanisms that maintain proteostasis begin to fail—oxidative damage accumulates, healthy synthesis, and degradation slows down—and hallmarks of age-associated pathology begin to emerge (3Hipp M.S. Kasturi P. Hartl F.U. The proteostasis network and its decline in ageing.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2019; 20: 421-435Google Scholar, 4Santra M. Dill K.A. de Graff A.M.R.

The molecular principles governing the activity and functional diversity of AAA+ proteins.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2020; 21: 43-58Google Scholar). Of note, PIM1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is defined by a unique insertion of approximately 50 highly charged residues between the ATPase and protease domains (Fig. S1). Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we aimed to define the oligomeric state of PIM1 from S. cerevisiae and understand the structural role of this charged insertion in protease enzymatic activity. Here, we recombinantly expressed and purified S.cerevisiae PIM1 to reveal that PIM1 in the presence of translocating substrate indeed forms a right-handed spiral configuration consistent with orthologous Lon protease structures and other AAA+ proteases. Aromatic pore loop residues directly bind substrate at the central channel of the ATPase domain, indicating this protease functions through the canonical hand-over-hand substrate translocation mechanism that is coordinated with ATP binding and hydrolysis. Structural comparisons of PIM1 to previously defined conformations of bacterial and human Lon reveal that the protease domain of PIM1 is in a proteolytically competent active state. In contrast to all prior structures, we observe an extended C-terminal tail forming an α-helix located along the base of the protease domain, engaged in hydrophobic interactions with the base of the core protease domain. Finally, despite structural conservation of the regions that flank the 50-residue charged insertion unique to S. cerevisiae, we did not observe ordered density corresponding to the charged residues, indicating this region is independently flexible. Biochemical assays targeting this charged region demonstrate minimal effects on Lon protease function, indicating that the yeast-specific charged insertion is dispensable for its enzymatic function. Although atomic structures of bacterial and human Lon define a hexameric assembly for Lon protease, initial negative-stain electron microscopy and analytical centrifugation suggested that yeast Lon (PIM1) oligomerizes into a heptameric assembly (12Stahlberg H. Kutejová E. Suda K. Wolpensinger B. Lustig A. Schatz G. Engel A. Suzuki C.K. Mitochondrial Lon of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a ring-shaped protease with seven flexible subunits.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6787-6790Google Scholar). Of note, PIM1 from S. cerevisiae is defined by charged insertion of approximately 50 residues between the ATPase and protease domains (Fig. S1). To define the oligomeric state of PIM1 and understand the structural role of this charged insertion, we aimed to determine a high-resolution structure of PIM1. We recombinantly expressed and purified mature WT S. cerevisiae PIM1 lacking the mitochondrial targeting sequence from bacteria, hereafter referred to as PIM1. After size-exclusion chromatography, PIM1 was incubated with saturating amounts of ATPγS (1 mM), a slowly hydrolyzing ATP analog, and plunge-frozen for investigation by cryo-EM. Remarkably, data collection and image analysis yielded the structure of PIM1 in a hexameric, closed, substrate-translocating state at a reported resolution of ∼3.2 Å. Notably, and in stark contrast to all prior cryo-EM studies of Lon proteases in other species (13Shin M. Puchades C. Asmita A. Puri N. Adjei E. Wiseman R.L. Karzai A.W. Lander G.C.

Molecular basis for ATPase-powered substrate translocation by the Lon AAA+ protease.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 297: 101239Google Scholar), we did not observe the presence of a fully ADP-bound substrate-free oligomer, typically defined by the AAA+ domains adopting an open, left-handed spiral organization. We note a high degree of background in our micrographs, which we believe to be monomeric PIM1 derived from biochemical instability of the hexamer or particle disruption at the air–water interface (Fig. S2A). Indeed, previous structural analyses of oligomeric PIM1 required cross-linking by glutaraldehyde and demonstrated nucleotide-dependent stability (12Stahlberg H. Kutejová E. Suda K. Wolpensinger B. Lustig A. Schatz G. Engel A. Suzuki C.K. Mitochondrial Lon of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a ring-shaped protease with seven flexible subunits.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6787-6790Google Scholar). This leads us to speculate that, unlike other Lon proteases, yeast PIM1 only hexamerizes in the presence of substrate. Consistent with the structures of bacterial and human Lon as well as other AAA+ proteases (13Shin M. Puchades C. Asmita A. Puri N. Adjei E. Wiseman R.L. Karzai A.W. Lander G.C.

Sandate C.R. Lander G.C. The molecular principles governing the activity and functional diversity of AAA+ proteins.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2020; 21: 43-58Google Scholar), PIM1 reveals a hexameric assembly defined by a right-handed spiral configuration (Fig. 1A, monomer depiction in Fig. S3). Residues 529 to 1133, comprising the N-terminal 3-helix bundle, ATPase, and protease domains, were well-resolved to enable model building and refinement. This hexameric PIM1 assembly is highly similar to that of bacterial and human Lon with ∼0.9 Å RMSD in the ATPase domain and ∼0.6 Å RMSD in the protease domain. Despite the inclusion of residues 181 to 528, which compose the N-terminal domain in our construct, we only observed blurred density corresponding to this region in 2D class averages (Fig. S2B), suggesting that the N-terminal domain of PIM1 is flexible. Although PIM1 was not purified in the presence of exogenous substrate, we observe substrate density intercalated with the substrate-translocating pore loop residues of Lon, which we modeled as a nine-residue poly-alanine chain (Fig. 1B). We speculate that this substrate may derive from the recombinant expression system or PIM1 itself, which has been observed for other AAA+ proteases (15Puchades C. Sandate C.R. Lander G.C. The molecular principles governing the activity and functional diversity of AAA+ proteins.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2020; 21: 43-58Google Scholar). Across AAA+ proteins, a conserved aromatic-hydrophobic motif found in pore loop residues directly mediates AAA+-dependent substrate unfolding and translocation (15Puchades C. Sandate C.R. Lander G.C. The molecular principles governing the activity and functional diversity of AAA+ proteins.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2020; 21: 43-58Google Scholar). In agreement, ATP-bound PIM1 subunits interact with substrate via the conserved pore loop 1 aromatic residue Y674 and hydrophobic residue I675 (Fig. 1B). These conserved pore loop 1 residues engage unfolded substrate with a “pincer-like” grasp and, according to the hand-over-hand model of translocation, the energy conferred by ATP hydrolysis is used to shuttle unfolded substrate toward the proteolytic chamber for degradation. Prior structural studies of substrate-translocating AAA+ proteins and Lon proteases are consistent with this model of hand-over-hand substrate translocation (13Shin M. Puchades C. Asmita A. Puri N.

Molecular basis for ATPase-powered substrate translocation by the Lon AAA+ protease.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 297: 101239Google Scholar). In this model, pore loop residues of ATP-bound subunits form a spiral arrangement wherein the lower-most subunit’s pore loop residue typically exists in an intermediary state. In concordance with the AAA+ organization of bacterial Lon proteases (13Shin M. Puchades C. Asmita A. Puri N. Adjei E. Wiseman R.L. Karzai A.W. Lander G.C. Structural basis for distinct operational modes and protease activation in AAA+ protease Lon.Sci. Adv. 2020; 6eaba8404Google Scholar, 17Coscia F. Löwe J.

Molecular basis for ATPase-powered substrate translocation by the Lon AAA+ protease.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 297: 101239Google Scholar), our substrate-translocating PIM1 structure consists of four descending ATPase domains (labeled here as ATP1–3, ATP4) and two ascending ‘seam’ subunits (ADP1–2). The ADP-bound subunits are found between the lowest and highest subunits of the substrate-bound spiral arrangement, and ADP-bound subunit pore loop residues are indeed disengaged from substrate (Fig. 1B, ADP1/ADP2). It is believed that as ATP hydrolysis occurs in the lowermost subunit ATP-bound subunit, this subunit releases its grip on substrate and the remaining three ATP-bound subunits drop to a lower register within the spiral staircase, translocating substrate a distance of two residues. Concurrently, the ADP2 subunit exchanges ADP for ATP and engages substrate at the top of the staircase (15Puchades C. Sandate C.R. Lander G.C. The molecular principles governing the activity and functional diversity of AAA+ proteins.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2020; 21: 43-58Google Scholar). The nucleotide binding pockets in substrate-bound Lon protease are found in a cleft between the large and small subdomains of the ATPase domain. This cleft is located at a protomer–protomer interface and enables nucleotide-dependent changes to allosterically influence the nucleotide-bound subunit as well as its neighboring subunit. Structurally, the nucleotide-bound subunit is characterized by universally conserved structural motifs, such as the Walker A motif (important for nucleotide binding, K638 in PIM1) and the Walker B motif (important for nucleotide hydrolysis, E700 in PIM1), and partially conserved structural motifs, such as the sensor-1 residue (N750 in PIM1) and cis-acting sensor-2 residue (R820 in PIM1). These sensor-1 and cis-acting sensor-2 residues position the ATP β-γ phosphate bond for hydrolysis. Finally, a trans-acting arginine finger (R672) from the neighboring subunit interacts with the γ-phosphate to critically convey nucleotide status. The resolution of our reconstructed density enabled modeling of these nucleotide interactions (Fig. S4). The four subunits that directly engage substrate and form a continuous right-handed spiral staircase contain density consistent with an ATP molecule. These subunits are named ATP1, ATP2, ATP3, and ATP4 in order from the uppermost subunit of the ATPase staircase to the lowest. The remaining two subunits do not directly engage subunit and do not contain density for a γ-phosphate and are named ADP1 and ADP2. Upon translocation of substrate to the proteolytic chamber, PIM1 uses a serine–lysine catalytic dyad formed by S1015 and K1058 to cleave substrates. Previous structural examination of the bacterial Lon protease domain in substrate-free and substrate-bound conformations showed that in a substrate-free configuration, the S1015-containing helix folds into a 310 helix that sterically blocks access of substrate to the serine–lysine catalytic dyad (13Shin M. Puchades C. Asmita A. Puri N. Adjei E. Wiseman R.L. Karzai A.W. Lander G.C. Structural basis for distinct operational modes and protease activation in AAA+ protease Lon.Sci. Adv. 2020; 6eaba8404Google Scholar, 14Shin M. Watson E.R. Song A.S. Mindrebo J.T. Novick S.J. Griffin P.R. Wiseman R.L. Lander G.C. Structures of the human LONP1 protease reveal regulatory steps involved in protease activation.Nat. Commun. 2021; 12: 3239Google Scholar). Upon substrate binding–induced symmetrization of the protease domain, this 310 helix unfolds to allow for a proteolytically competent serine–lysine catalytic dyad. The organization we observe in our PIM1 structure is consistent with the proteolytically competent conformation, where 310 helix is unfolded to form a substrate-binding groove and the serine–lysine dyad formed by S1015 and K1058 can be accessed by unfolded substrate (Fig. 2, A and B). Previous structural work on the human Lon protease showed that substrate binding within the ATPase channel was insufficient to trigger a rearrangement of the protease domains to a symmetric proteolytically competent conformer, suggestive of a multilevel regulatory mechanism (14Shin M. Watson E.R. Song A.S. Mindrebo J.T. Novick S.J. Griffin P.R. Wiseman R.L. Lander G.C. Structures of the human LONP1 protease reveal regulatory steps involved in protease activation.Nat. Commun. 2021; 12: 3239Google Scholar). The symmetric organization of our PIM1 structure, which is consistent with bacterial structures, indicates that the human regulatory mechanisms are not conserved across eukaryotes. PIM1 contains a C-terminal extension that is not present in bacterial or human Lon. This C-terminal extension was unexpectedly well-resolved as an α-helix in our reconstruction and runs along the base of the protease domain (Fig. 2C). Structural comparison of the PIM1 protease domain with that of substrate-translocating Yersenia pestis Lon (PDB ID: 6on2) and human Lon (PDB ID: 7krz) highlights structural conservation up to L1106 of PIM1 (Fig. 2D). Although sequence alignment of PIM1 with Yersinia pestis Lon and human Lon suggest that these protease domains are homologous up to K1120 of PIM1 (Fig. S1), residues beyond the structurally conserved α-helix in bacterial or human Lon could not be modeled due to disorder of the C-terminal regions. In PIM1, the conserved α-helix is followed by an ordered loop extending to K1120 and ending with an α-helix (A1121 to K1129) that is unique to PIM1. Situated at the base of the protease domain, the C-terminal helix is stabilized by intrasubunit hydrophobic interactions among residues V1118, W1119, F1123, I1125, and L1126 of the C terminus, residues F994 and A1028 of the core protease domain, and residues L952 and H953 of a loop at the base of the core protease domain, hereafter referred to as the CT helix-interacting loop (Fig. 2E). To define the functional importance of the yeast-specific C-terminal extension, we compared our structure of PIM1 with the available structures of substrate-free and substrate-translocating Lon proteases. Structural analyses revealed that regions around residues F994 and A1028 of the core protease domain and the CT helix-interacting loop are structurally invariant in both substrate-free and substrate-translocating conformations. Based on available structural information, the functional importance of the yeast-specific C-terminal extension is obscure. Given the location of the C-terminal helix at the base of the protease chamber, we speculate that the C-terminal helix may be involved in cleaved peptide release, although further investigation of this potential activity is necessary. One of the aims of our study was to understand the structural importance of the charged insertion of approximately 50 residues between the ATPase and protease domains of PIM1. Unexpectedly, in our reconstruction of substrate-translocating PIM1, we did not observe density for this yeast-specific charged insertion. We observe strong density preceding and subsequent to the charged insertion at K840 and N898, respectively. Both the K840-containing α-helix and the N898-containing β-strand are structurally conserved elements across the ATPase domain of Lon orthologues (Fig. 3A). Based on the apparent disorder of the charged insertion in our structure of PIM1, we wondered whether the insertion is functionally dispensable for PIM1 enzymatic activities. To clarify the biochemical implications of this charged insertion on PIM1 function, we generated two mutants: (1) charged insertion deletion (PIM1-INSdel) and (2) replacement of charged insertion with a glycine–serine linker of identical length (PIM1-GSlink) (Fig. 3B). With the PIM1-INSdel construct, we aimed to examine whether the charged insertion was completely dispensable; with the PIM1-GSlink construct, we aimed to discriminate whether it was the amino acid composition or insertion length that was critical for PIM1 function. For both PIM1-INSdel and PIM1-Gslink mutants, we observed close to WT levels of ATP-dependent substrate degradation in a gel-based proteolysis assay using casein as a model substrate and a protease-inactive (S1015A) PIM1 as a control (Fig. 3C). This demonstrates that this charged insertion is dispensable for Lon proteolytic activity. Based on our biochemistry and structural analyses, we speculate that this yeast-specific insertion may be required for recruitment of substrates or PIM1 adaptor proteins. Here, we determined the cryo-EM structure of substrate-translocating PIM1 from S. cerevisiae to demonstrate that PIM1 forms a hexameric assembly, consistent with multiple Lon protease structures from bacteria and human. As observed in other AAA+ protein translocases, aromatic pore loop residues directly bind substrate at the central channel of the ATPase domain to processively shuttle unfolded polypeptides in a hand-over-hand mechanism coordinated with ATP binding and hydrolysis. Examination of the PIM1 protease domains reveals that they organize into a C6-symmetric assembly that is proteolytically competent, similar to the bacterial form and the human Lon when bound to bortezomib (13Shin M. Puchades C. Asmita A. Puri N. Adjei E. Wiseman R.L. Karzai A.W. Lander G.C. Structural basis for distinct operational modes and protease activation in AAA+ protease Lon.Sci.

Structures of the human LONP1 protease reveal regulatory steps involved in protease activation.Nat. Commun. 2021; 12: 3239Google Scholar). The reconstruction also shows the presence of an extended, ordered C terminus, which includes an α-helix located along the base of the protease domain. Structurally, the role of these yeast-specific C-terminal residues is ambiguous, as the central cavity is not noticeably occluded by this 14-residue extension and interactions of the C termini appear to be strictly intraprotomeric. We speculate that these yeast-specific C-terminal residues could facilitate cleaved peptide release, which warrants future investigation. Of note, PIM1 from S. cerevisiae is defined by a charged insertion of approximately 50 residues between the ATPase and protease domains. Although our reconstruction confirms structural conservation of the regions before and after this charged insertion, we do not observe density for the charged insertion loop itself. To understand the functional role of the charged insertion, we examined Lon mutants that delete the insertion and replace the insertion with a nonspecific glycine–serine linker of identical length. In biochemical assays examining protease activity, we demonstrate minimal effects on Lon protease function. Thus, we propose that the yeast-specific charged insertion is dispensable for enzymatic function. Our investigation of PIM1 suggests that Lon proteases are structurally conserved across all kingdoms of life. Indeed, previous work replacing PIM1 with a mitochondrially targeted Lon protease from Escherichia coli has demonstrated that Lon proteases are highly functionally redundant (19Teichmann U. van Dyck L. Guiard B. Fischer H. Glockshuber R. Neupert W. Langer T. Substitution of PIM1 protease in mitochondria by Escherichia coli Lon protease.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10137-10142Google Scholar). In this previous study, Teichmann et al. demonstrated that WT E.coli Lon, but not protease-inactive Lon, could rescue respiration deficiency and mitochondrial DNA integrity of PIM1 knock-out cells at 30 °C and mediate degradation of mitochondrial matrix proteins. Notably, at 37 °C, WT E.coli Lon could not rescue respiration deficiency and mitochondrial DNA integrity of PIM1 knock-out cells. Teichmann"

Our findings support previous conclusions that quality hospitals are concentrated in cities with high administrative rankings and developmental levels. However, after accounting for the population size an ""accessible"" hospital serves, we discern ""pro-poor"" inequality in accessibility to care (denoted as GAPSD) and that GAPSD decreases along with increases in administrative rankings of cities and in community ratings. This paper is significant for both research and policy-making. Our approach successfully reveals an ""unexpected"" pattern of health care inequality that has not been reported before, and our findings provide a nationwide, detailed benchmark that facilitates the assessment of health and urban policies, as well as associated policy-making."

Their anti-tumor activity is achieved through amplifying components of the patient’s own immune system to target immune response evading cancer cells. However, this unique mechanism of action causes a range of immune related adverse events, irAEs, that affect multiple physiological systems in the body. These irAEs, depending on severity, often cause suspension or discontinuation of therapy and, in rare cases, may lead to fatal outcomes. In this study we focused on pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor currently approved for multiple types of cancer. We analyzed over ten thousand adverse event reports from Keynote clinical trials of pembrolizumab for various cancer indications with or without co-occurring infections, and observed a statistically significant 80% increase in the risk of developing an irAE in subjects with infections."

These approaches, however, have not consistently included an economic efficiency analysis dimension. This systematic review aims to examine how, and in what ways, system dynamics modelling approaches incorporate economic efficiency analyses to inform decision-making on innovations (improvements in products, services, or processes) in the public sector, with a particular interest in health.Relevant studies (n = 29) were identified through a systematic search and screening of four electronic databases and backward citation search, and analysed for key characteristics and themes related to the analytical methods applied. Economic efficiency analysis approaches within SD broadly fell into two categories: as embedded sub-models or as cost calculations based on the outputs of the SD model. Embdedded sub-models within a dynamic SD framework can reveal a clear allocation of costs and benefits to periods of time, whereas cost calculations based on the SD model outputs can be useful for high-level resource allocation decisions.This systematic review reveals that SD modelling is not currently used to its full potential to evaluate the technical or allocative efficiency of public sector innovations, particularly in health. The limited reporting on the experience or methodological challenges of applying allocated efficiency analyses with SD, particularly with dynamic embedded models, hampers common learning lessons to draw from and build on. Further application and comprehensive reporting of this approach would be welcome to develop the methodology further."

As herbivorous pests, aphids reproduce rapidly due to parthenogenesis. They are good biological materials for studying the mechanisms that allow insect adaptation to host plants. Insect detoxification gene families are associated with insect adaptation to host plants. The Aphidinae is the largest subfamily in the Aphididae with at least 2483 species in 256 genera in 2 tribes: the Macrosiphini (with 3/4 of the species) and the Aphidini. Most aphid pests on crops and ornamental plants are Aphidinae. Members of the Aphidinae occur in nearly every region of the world. The body shape and colour vary significantly. To research the role that detoxification gene families played in the process of aphid adaptation to host evolution, we analyzed the phylogeny and evolution of these detoxification gene families in Aphidinae. In general, the P450/GST/CCE gene families contract, whereas the ABC/UGT families are conserved in Aphidinae species compared to these families in other herbivorous insects. Genus-specific expansions of P450 CYP4, and GST Delta have occurred in the genus Acyrthosiphon. In addition, the evolutionary rates of five detoxification gene families in the evolution process of Aphidinae are different. The comparison of five detoxification gene families among nine Aphidinae species and the estimated relative evolutionary rates provided herein support an understanding of the interaction between and the co-evolution of Aphidinae and plants."
https://openalex.org/W4210979047,"Background Maternity waiting home (MWH) is a direct strategy to improve newborn and maternal survival. The utilization of MWH, however, remains very low in Ethiopia. Men involvement in maternal health programs is a key strategy to increase utilization of maternal health services, including MWH. This study defines men involvement in-terms of men’s participation in deciding to admit their spouse to an MWH, accompanying their spouse to an MWH, providing financial support, availing food at an MWH, and taking care of the home or children. Thus, the current study aims to identify factors affecting men’s involvement in MWH utilization. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from October 1st to December 30th, 2018. Four hundred three men were involved in the study. Data were analyzed by the statistical package for social science (SPSS) version 23. Independent predictors were identified by a multivariable logistic regression model. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported. Results Men’s involvement in MWH was 55.6% (50.71, 60.45). Age (AOR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.82–0.94), knowledge about MWH (AOR = 4.74, 95% CI = 2.65–8.49), decision-making power (AOR = 4.00, 95% CI = 1.38–11.57), and receiving counseling about MWH during spousal antenatal care visits (AOR = 9.15, 95% CI = 3.34–25.03) had statistically significant associations with men’s involvement in MWH utilization. Conclusions Nearly, half of the male partners were involved in MWH utilization. Men’s age, MWH knowledge, decision-making power, and receiving counseling were factors affecting their involvement in MWH utilization. Interventions targeting to improve male involvement in MWH utilization should focus on building men’s knowledge about MWH, increasing male involvement in ANC with an appropriate level of counseling about MWH, and changing patriarchal thinking in society with appropriate behavioral interventions such as community-based health education."

The daily mobility of people in Mexico City is mathematically represented by an origin-destination matrix using the open mobility data from Google and the Transportation Mexican Survey. This matrix is incorporated in a compartmental model. We calibrate the model against borough-level incidence data collected between 27 February 2020 and 27 October 2020, while using Bayesian inference to estimate critical epidemiological characteristics associated with the coronavirus spread. Given that working with metapopulation models leads to rather high computational time consumption, and parameter estimation of these models may lead to high memory RAM consumption, we do a clustering analysis that is based on mobility trends to work on these clusters of borough separately instead of taken all of the boroughs together at once. This clustering analysis can be implemented in smaller or larger scales in different parts of the world. In addition, this clustering analysis is divided into the phases that the government of Mexico City has set up to restrict individual movement in the city. We also calculate the reproductive number in Mexico City using the next generation operator method and the inferred model parameters obtaining that this threshold is in the interval (1.2713, 1.3054).

https://openalex.org/W4210283912,"Cocaine addiction remains a serious problem lacking an effective pharmacological treatment. Thus, we have developed a high-affinity anti-cocaine monoclonal antibody (mAb), h2E2, for the treatment of cocaine use disorders. We show that selective tryptophan (Trp) oxidation by 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) resulted in a loss of high-affinity binding of cocaine to this mAb. The newly developed use of excess methionine (Met) to protect mAb met residues from AAPH oxidation did not substantially attenuate the effects of oxidation on cocaine binding but greatly decreased the modification of met residues in the mAb. Similar large decreases in ligand affinity (5000-10,000-fold) upon oxidation were observed using cocaine and two cocaine metabolites, cocaethylene and benzoylecgonine, which also bind with nanomolar affinity to this h2E2 mAb. The decrease in binding affinity was accompanied by a decrease of approximately 50% in Trp fluorescence, and increases in mAb 310 to 370 nm absorbance were consistent with the presence of oxidized forms of Trp. Finally, mass spectral analysis of peptides derived from control and AAPH-oxidized mAb indicated that excess free met did effectively protect mAb met residues from oxidation, and that AAPH-oxidized mAb heavy-chain Trp33 and light-chain Trp91 residues are important for cocaine binding, consistent with a recently derived h2E2 Fab fragment crystal structure containing bound benzoylecgonine. Thus, protection of the anti-cocaine h2E2 mAb from Trp oxidation prior to its clinical administration is critical for its proposed therapeutic use in the treatment of cocaine use disorders."
https://openalex.org/W4210871791,"Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is a potentially lethal autoimmune mucocutaneous blistering disease characterized by binding of IgG autoantibodies (AuAbs) to keratinocytes (KCs). In addition to AuAbs against adhesion molecules desmogleins 1 and 3, PV patients also produce an AuAb against the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor (M3AR) that plays an important role in regulation of vital functions of KCs upon binding endogenous ACh. This anti-M3AR AuAb is pathogenic because its adsorption eliminates the acantholytic activity of PV IgG; however, the molecular mechanism of its action is unclear. In the present study, we sought to elucidate the mode of immunopharmacologic action of the anti-M3AR AuAb in PV. Short-term exposures of cultured KCs to PV IgG or the muscarinic agonist muscarine both induced changes in the expression of keratins 5 and 10, consistent with the inhibition of proliferation and upregulated differentiation and in keeping with the biological function of M3AR. In contrast, long-term incubations induced a keratin expression pattern consistent with upregulated proliferation and decreased differentiation, in keeping with the hyperproliferative state of KCs in PV. This change could result from desensitization of the M3AR, representing the net antagonist-like effect of the AuAb. Therefore, chronic exposure of KCs to the anti-M3AR AuAb interrupts the physiological regulation of KCs by endogenous ACh, contributing to the onset of acantholysis. Since cholinergic agents have already demonstrated antiacantholytic activity in a mouse model of PV and in PV patients, our results have translational significance and can guide future development of therapies for PV patients employing cholinergic drugs.

Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is a potentially lethal autoimmune mucocutaneous blistering disease characterized by IgG autoantibodies (AuAbs) binding to keratinocytes (KCs) and inducing devastating blisters affecting oral and/or esophageal surfaces and, sometime, also the skin. Although the incidence of PV is only 1 to 16 per million population per year (1Pisanti S. Sharav Y. Kaufman E. Posner L.N.

Prior to the introduction of therapy with oral corticosteroids in the 1950s, pemphigus had a dismal natural course with a 50% mortality rate at 2 years and 100% mortality rate by 5 years after onset of the disease. While corticosteroid treatment is life-saving, the high dose and prolonged courses required for disease control are associated with significant adverse effects, including death (4Ahmed A.R. Moy R.

Dermatol. 1976; 112: 962-970Google Scholar). Mortality remains at a relatively high rate, ranging from 5 to 13%, due to differences in patient care in different parts of the world (6Herbst A.

Pemphigus vulgaris patients develop intraepidermal cell-cell detachment (acantholysis) above the basal cell layer, blisters, and nonhealing erosions. The initial event of acantholysis is basal cell separation from each other and immediate suprabasal KCs. Under an AuAb attack, basal cells shrink, causing intercellular separation, but remain attached to the epidermal basement membrane, forming a unique pattern known as ""tombstoning"" (9Bystryn J.-C. Grando S.A. A novel explanation for acantholysis in pemphigus vulgaris – the “basal cell shrinkage” hypothesis.J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 2006; 54: 513-516Google Scholar). In typical PV, AuAbs recognize desmosomal protein desmoglein 3 (Dsg3) and sometime also desmoglein 1 (Dsg1). However, on average, 10% of acute PV patients with anti-KC AuAbs detectable by direct and/or indirect immunofluorescence are negative for Dsg1/3 AuAbs by ELISA (reviewed in (10Gualtieri B. Marzano V. Grando S.A. Atypical pemphigus: Autoimmunity against desmocollins and other non-desmoglein autoantigens.Ital. J. Dermatol. Venerol. 2021; 156: 134-141Google Scholar)). There are no known clinical and pathological differences between PV patients with versus without anti-Dsg AuAbs. Anti-KC AuAbs in patients with atypical, that is, anti-Dsg1/3 AuAb-negative PV (non-Dsg PV in short), are pathogenic because their IgGs induce skin blistering in neonatal mice due to suprabasal acantholysis (11Chernyavsky A. Amber K.T. Agnoletti A.F. Wang C. Grando S.A. Synergy among non-desmoglein antibodies contributes to the immunopathology of desmoglein antibody-negative pemphigus vulgaris.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 4520-4528Google Scholar). Keratinocytes in the lowermost epidermal layers are the primary target for AuAbs in both typical and atypical PV. In typical PV, basal KCs are believed to be selectively targeted because they express a bulk of Dsg3, whereas in atypical PV, the predominant pathogenic target on basal KCs remains unknown. Our studies suggest that the M3 muscarinic class of acetylcholine (ACh) receptors (M3AR) is the most likely candidate. The M3AR is preferentially coupled to activation of pertussis toxin–insensitive G proteins of the Gαq/11 family, which activates phospholipase C (PLC) and produces inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DG). These second messengers elicit activation of PKC and trigger the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores ([Ca2+]i). M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor is predominantly expressed in the lowermost epidermal layer wherein it regulates vital function of KCs, including proliferation, migration, and adhesion (reviewed in (12Grando S.A. Cholinergic control of epidermal cohesion in norm and pathology.Exp. Dermatol. 2006; 15: 265-282Google Scholar, 13Grando S.A.

It has been demonstrated that M3AR controls cytoskeleton assembly and formation of cell–cell attachments (14Williams C.L. Hayes V.Y. Hummel A.M. Tarara J.E. Halsey T.J.

The pathogenic significance of anti-M3AR AuAb in PV is suggested by the following lines of evidence: (1) proteomic studies demonstrated anti-M3AR AuAb in a large number of PV sera (20Kalantari-Dehaghi M.

Li F. Mechanisms of Trx2/ASK1-mediated mitochondrial injury in pemphigus vulgaris.Biomed. Res. Int. 2021; 2021: 2471518Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanism of pathogenic action of anti-M3AR AuAb in PV remains poorly understood and requires further investigation. The role for autoimmunity against KC M3AR in non-Dsg PV was evaluated using 1-day old M3AR−/− mice (24Chernyavsky A. Patel K.G. Grando S.A. Mechanisms of synergy of autoantibodies to M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor and secretory pathway Ca(2+)/Mn(2+)-ATPase isoform 1 in patients with non-desmoglein pemphigus vulgaris.Int. Immunopharmacol. 2020; 80: 106149Google Scholar). Compared to WT mice, the intact M3AR KO mice demonstrated an increase of intercellular spaces due to mild shrinkage of epidermal cells. Similar subtle morphologic changes were observed in WT pups injected with the affinity-purified anti-M3AR AuAb. Injection of PV IgGs caused spontaneous skin blistering and superficial erosions in both WT and M3AR−/− mice. However, while injection of PV IgGs to a WT mouse predictably caused suprabasal acantholysis, the entire basal cell layer was missing at the bottom of blister cavity in M3AR−/− mice. These results suggested that in non-Dsg PV, anti-M3AR AuAb determines the suprabasal location of the intraepidermal split. As we have previously demonstrated (17Nguyen V.T. Chernyavsky A.I. Arredondo J. Bercovich D. Orr-Urtreger A. Vetter D.E. Wess J. Beaudet A.L. Kitajima Y. Grando S.A. Synergistic control of keratinocyte adhesion through muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes.Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 294: 534-549Google Scholar, 33Chernyavsky A.I. Arredondo J. Wess J. Karlsson E. Grando S.A. Novel signaling pathways mediating reciprocal control of keratinocyte migration and wound epithelialization by M3 and M4 muscarinic receptors.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 261-272Google Scholar), constant physiologic stimulation of KC M3AR with endogenous ACh maintains attachment of basal cells to the basal membrane, in part, due to upregulation of sedentary (hemidesmosomal) integrins anchoring KCs to the basal membrane. Lack of the M3AR-mediated physiologic control of cell-substrate attachment by endogeneous ACh explains disappearance of the basal cells in blisters induced by PV IgG in M3AR−/− mice. Since basal cells remained attached to the basal membrane in WT mice treated with affinity-purified anti-M3AR AuAb or with whole PV IgG fraction that contained anti-M3AR AuAb as well as other species of anti-KC AuAbs, it is likely that anti-M3AR AuAb exhibited an agonist-like immunopharmacological effect, by analogy with the thyrotropin receptor AuAb that stimulates the thyroid function in Graves' hyperthyroidism. Our research goal is to understand how anti-M3AR AuAb affects adhesion of basal KCs. Based on the overwhelming evidence that ACh to M3AR signaling pathway is an essential physiologic regulator of cell adhesion in the epidermis (reviewed in (12Grando S.A. Cholinergic control of epidermal cohesion in norm and pathology.Exp. Dermatol. 2006; 15: 265-282Google Scholar, 13Grando S.A. Muscarinic receptor agonists and antagonists: Effects on keratinocyte functions.Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2012; 208: 429-450Google Scholar)), elucidation of immunopharmacologic aspects of autoimmunity against KC M3AR in PV should open a door for evaluation of cholinergic drugs for steroid-sparing therapy of PV patients and patients with some other diseases of skin adhesion featuring acantholysis. In the present study, we sought to elucidate the exact mode of immunopharmacologic action of pathogenic anti-M3AR AuAb on basal KCs. Cumulative results of our immunohistochemical, immunoblotting, and radioligand-binding experiments indicate that anti-M3AR AuAb produced in non-Dsg PV patients exhibits an agonist-like effect that leads to receptor desensitization (a.k.a. tachyphylaxis), which, in turn, abolishes the physiologic regulation of KCs with endogeneous ACh thus contributing to acantholysis. Therefore, the net pathobiologic effect of anti-M3AR AuAb is an antagonist-like effect. These findings provide new insights into the immunopharmacologic mechanisms of initiation of acantholysis in PV, and also lay a groundwork for future translational studies evaluating the antiacantholytic potential of cholinergic drugs. Since the effect of chronic exposure to PV IgGs on the expression of KC M3AR could not be evaluated in vivo due to death of neonatal mice, we treated mice with affinity-purified anti-M3AR AuAb. The neonatal C57BL/6 mice were injected intradermally with anti-M3AR AuAb every 12 h over 3 days, after which the M3AR was visualized in the epidermis by indirect immunofluorescence using commercial rabbit anti-M3AR antibody. Qualitative analysis of the intensity of fluorescence demonstrated dramatic decrease from the baseline in experimental mice treated with anti-M3AR AuAb (Fig. 1). We sacrificed mice every 12 h after injections but did not see any appreciable differences until after 72 h. The control mice that received injection of equal concentration of normal IgG (NIgG) or plain saline did not develop any visible changes of the staining pattern (data not shown). We also stained murine epidermis for M1, M4, and M5 mAChR subtypes expressed in KCs (34Ndoye A. Buchli R. Greenberg B. Nguyen V.T. Zia S. Rodriguez J.G. Webber R.J. Lawry M.A. Grando S.A. Identification and mapping of keratinocyte muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes in human epidermis.J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 410-416Google Scholar) and did not observe any changes from controls (data not shown). These results suggested that chronic stimulation of KCs with anti-M3AR AuAb leads to disappearance of the targeted receptor from the cell surface. To elucidate whether decreased expression of M3AR in murine epidermis occurred at the mRNA or the protein levels, or both, we performed a series of real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and In-cell Western experiments with cultured murine epidermal KCs. The cells were cultivated in the culture medium for 24, 48, or 72 h in the presence of PV IgG isolated from the pooled sera of PV patients who did not develop anti-M3AR AuAb, those who did as well as affinity-purified anti-M3AR AuAb or the pan-muscarinic agonist muscarine, after which the levels or receptor mRNA and protein were quantitated and compared with intact controls (Fig. 2). The results demonstrated statistically significant (p <0.05) decrease in the receptor expression at the protein but not mRNA levels when the cells were exposed to affinity-purified anti-M3AR AuAb, PV IgG containing anti-M3AuAb, and the muscarinic agonist muscarine, but not PV IgG without anti-M3AR AuAb. In a time-course study of M3AR protein, we found that the degree of receptor loss correlated with duration of incubations, so that longer exposures resulted in more profound changes. None of the exposure conditions led to any significant alterations of the mRNAs or proteins of other mAChR subtypes expressed in KCs (Fig. 2). These results confirmed the specificity of the effect of PV AuAbs on the KC M3AR subtype. The effect of PV IgG on the expression of M3AR in human KCs was analyzed by immunoblotting. The monolayers of Het-1A cells were incubated for 72 h in the growth media supplemented with equal amounts of PV IgG containing anti-M3AR AuAb, or NIgG, or no additions, and the M3AR protein bands were visualized by immunoblotting with commercial anti-M3AR antibody (Fig. 3). As expected, the M3AR protein band appeared at approximately 65 kDa (34Ndoye A. Buchli R. Greenberg B. Nguyen V.T. Zia S. Rodriguez J.G. Webber R.J. Lawry M.A. Grando S.A. Identification and mapping of keratinocyte muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes in human epidermis.J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 410-416Google Scholar). We observed a dramatic reduction in the relative amount of M3AR in KCs exposed to PV IgG. These results suggested that the pathophysiology of PV includes an AuAb-induced reduction of M3AR signaling in epidermal KCs. Next, we evaluated the immunopharmacologic action of PV IgG on KC M3AR. We preincubated the monolayers of Het-1A cells with PV IgG or NIgG for 1 h or 24 h, washed, and measured effects of the pan-muscarinic agonist muscarine and the M3-preferring antagonist 4-DAMP on the downstream effectors of M3AR signaling PLC, DG, and IP3 (Fig. 4). The maximum changes from receptor activation were determined in the intact cells stimulated with muscarine and taken as 100%. The specificity of the effects to ligation of M3AR was confirmed by the ability of 4-DAMP to abolish the effects of muscarine. Exposure to PV IgG for 1 h caused significant (p < 0.05) elevation of all second messengers. In marked contrast, the longer exposure to PV IgG (24 h), but not NIgG, resulted in the significant (p < 0.05) decrease of the cell responsiveness to stimulation with muscarine and PV IgG (Fig. 4). These results suggested that the anti-M3AR AuAb produced by PV patients exhibits an agonist-like pharmacologic effect and leads to receptor desensitization. To identify the role for desensitization of KC M3AR in PV pathophysiology, we analyzed the effects of PV IgG versus NIgG on binding of a muscarinic radioligand to human KCs. The monolayers of Het-1A cells were preincubated at 37 °C or 4 °C for 1 h in the growth medium containing equal amounts of PV IgG or NIgG and used in the radioligand-binding assay with the specific muscarinic ligand [3H]QNB (35Yamamura H.I. Snyder S.H. Muscarinic cholinergic binding in rat brain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 1725-1729Google Scholar). At 37 °C, the cycling of ligated receptors is rapid, whereas at 4 °C, receptor translocation is prevented (36Fisher S.K. Recognition of muscarinic cholinergic receptors in human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells by quaternary and tertiary ligands is dependent upon temperature, cell integrity, and the presence of agonists.Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 33: 414-422Google Scholar). Preincubation of Het-1A cells with PV IgG at 37 °C, but not 4 °C, decreased specific binding of [3H]QNB by about 80% (p < 0.05) (Fig. 5). Preincubation with NIgG did not alter the radioligand-binding parameters. These results suggested that desensitization of KC M3AR in PV due to its ligation by anti-M3AR AuAb is followed by receptor internalization and subsequent degradation. Since the physiologic regulation of basal cell differentiation through M3AR is well-established (reviewed in (37Grando S.A. Pittelkow M.R. Schallreuter K.U. Adrenergic and cholinergic control in the biology of epidermis: Physiological and clinical significance.J. Invest. Dermatol. 2006; 126: 1948-1965Google Scholar)), we analyzed the effects of short-term (i.e., 24 h) and long-term (i.e., 72 h) exposures to PV IgG on the expression of mRNAs of the KC differentiation markers cytokeratins K5 and K10. In these series of experiments, instead of nondifferentiating immortalized Het-1A cells, we used normal human epidermal KCs grown to ∼80% confluence in KC growth medium containing 1.6 mM Ca2+. A short-term exposure to PV IgG, but not NIgG, caused significant (p < 0.05) decrease of K5 and an increase of K10 mRNAs (Fig. 6). The effect of long-term preincubation was opposite, manifested by significant (p < 0.05) increase of K5 and decrease of K10 mRNAs. Because the effect of muscarine was similar to that of PV IgG (Fig. 6), it can be concluded that chronic stimulation of basal KCs with anti-M3AR AuAb alters maturation of KCs. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that chronic exposure to anti-M3AR AuAb depletes M3AR in mouse epidermis and cultured human KCs, and that this AuAb produces an agonist-like effect on the M3AR-mediated signaling. Taken together, these findings indicate that desensitization of KC M3AR in PV results from its ligation by an AuAb with its subsequent internalization and intracellular degradation. The dichotomous effect of PV IgGs on the cholinergic regulation of KC differentiation by ACh through M3AR observed in the present study suggests that a long-term exposure of basal KCs to anti-M3AR AuAb that interrupts physiologic regulation of KCs by non-neuronal ACh disturbs normal unfolding of the KC differentiation program in the epidermis of PV patients and thus contributes to acantholysis. These results help explain how acantholysis can occur in the absence of anti-Dsg1/3 AuAbs and shed new light on more broad mechanisms of KC damage in PV. The results obtained in the present study elaborate on the pathogenic role of non-Dsg AuAbs in PV. A recently published critical appraisal of different known triggering pathways in PV pathophysiology (38R H. Ramani P. Tilakaratne W.M. Sukumaran G. Ramasubramanian A. Krishnan R.P. Critical appraisal of different triggering pathways for the pathobiology of pemphigus vulgaris-a review.Oral Dis. 2021; https://doi.org/10.1111/odi.13937Google Scholar) emphasized that the pathogenesis of this serious disease is complex and requires an in-depth understanding of the various predisposing and provoking factors and effector mechanisms to improve the efficacy and safety of current treatments. Numerous studies conducted worldwide over the last 3 decades on anti-Dsg AuAbs convincingly demonstrated that these AuAbs can serve a reliable diagnostic marker of PV. Unfortunately, thus far this knowledge did not help to improve treatment of PV patients. The growing body of evidence about non-Dsg immunophenotype phenotypes of PV has prompted alternative explanations of the disease mechanisms and a search for new potential therapeutic targets (18Ahmed A.R. Carrozzo M. Caux F. Cirillo N. Dmochowski M. Alonso A.E. Gniadecki R. Hertl M. Lopez-Zabalza M.J. Lotti R. Pincelli C. Pittelkow M. Schmidt E. Sinha A.A. Sprecher E. et al.Monopathogenic vs. multipathogenic explanations of pemphigus pathophysiology.Exp. Dermatol. 2016; 25: 839-846Google Scholar). The non-Dsg PV represents a unique model for elucidation of non-Dsg self-antigens in the physiologic regulation of KC cell–cell adhesion and blister development. By now, more than 50 non-Dsg target antigens have been identified (reviewed in (39Amber K.T. Valdebran M. Grando S.A. Non-desmoglein antibodies in patients with pemphigus vulgaris.Front.

https://openalex.org/W4210922095,"A range of cargo adaptor proteins are known to recruit cytoskeletal motors to distinct subcellular compartments. However, the structural impact of cargo recruitment on motor function is poorly understood. Here, we dissect the multimodal regulation of myosin VI activity through the cargo adaptor GAIP-interacting protein, C terminus (GIPC), whose overexpression with this motor in cancer enhances cell migration. Using a range of biophysical techniques, including motility assays, FRET-based conformational sensors, optical trapping, and DNA origami-based cargo scaffolds to probe the individual and ensemble properties of GIPC-myosin VI motility, we report that the GIPC myosin-interacting region (MIR) releases an autoinhibitory interaction within myosin VI. We show that the resulting conformational changes in the myosin lever arm, including the proximal tail domain, increase the flexibility of the adaptor-motor linkage, and that increased flexibility correlates with faster actomyosin association and dissociation rates. Taken together, the GIPC MIR-myosin VI interaction stimulates a twofold to threefold increase in ensemble cargo speed. Furthermore, the GIPC MIR-myosin VI ensembles yield similar cargo run lengths as forced processive myosin VI dimers. We conclude that the emergent behavior from these individual aspects of myosin regulation is the fast, processive, and smooth cargo transport on cellular actin networks. Our study delineates the multimodal regulation of myosin VI by the cargo adaptor GIPC, while highlighting linkage flexibility as a novel biophysical mechanism for modulating cellular cargo motility."

Although alterations in ARF6 expression and activity have been linked to metastatic cancer in one or two tissues, the expression of ARF6 in cancers over a wide range of tissues has not been studied so far. In this report, we analysed the expression of ARF6 mRNA in cancers and corresponding healthy controls from 17 different tissues by real-time qualitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). We further evaluated ARF6 protein expression in oesophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) tissue microarray cores by immunohistochemistry. The ARF6 gene expression levels are highly variable between healthy and cancer tissues. Our findings suggest that the ARF6 gene expression is up-regulated highest in oesophageal cancer. In EAC TMAs, ARF6 protein expression increase correlated with EAC progression. This is the first study to investigate ARF6 gene expression in a wide array of cancer tissues and demonstrate that ARF6 expression, at both mRNA and protein levels, is significantly upregulated in higher grades of EAC, which may be useful in targeting ARF6 for cancer diagnostic and therapeutic purposes."

But how do observers deal with the wide variety of facial morphologies and, in particular, those outside their own familiar cultural group? Using reverse correlation, a data-driven approach to explore how individuals create internal representations without external biases, we studied the generation of trustworthy faces by French and Chinese participants (N = 160) within and outside their own cultural group. Participants selected the most trustworthy or attractive (control condition) face from two identical European or Asian descent faces that had been modified by different noise masks. A conjunction analysis to reveal facial features common to both cultures showed that Chinese and French participants unconsciously increased the contrast of the ""pupil-iris area"" to make the face appear more trustworthy. No significant effects common to both groups were found for the attraction condition suggesting that attraction judgements are dependent on cultural processes. These results suggest the presence of universal cross-cultural mechanisms for the construction of implicit first impressions of trust, and highlight the importance of the eyes area in this process."
https://openalex.org/W4226212028,"External peak power in the countermovement jump is frequently used to monitor athlete training. The gold standard method uses force platforms, but they are unsuitable for field-based testing. However, alternatives based on jump flight time or Newtonian methods applied to inertial sensor data have not been sufficiently accurate for athlete monitoring. Instead, we developed a machine learning model based on characteristic features (functional principal components) extracted from a single body-worn accelerometer. Data were collected from 69 male and female athletes at recreational, club or national levels, who performed 696 jumps in total. We considered vertical countermovement jumps (with and without arm swing), sensor anatomical locations, machine learning models and whether to use resultant or triaxial signals. Using a novel surrogate model optimisation procedure, we obtained the lowest errors with a support vector machine when using the resultant signal from a lower back sensor in jumps without arm swing. This model had a peak power RMSE of 2.3 W·kg-1 (5.1% of the mean), estimated using nested cross validation and supported by an independent holdout test (2.0 W·kg-1). This error is lower than in previous studies, although it is not yet sufficiently accurate for a field-based method. Our results demonstrate that functional data representations work well in machine learning by reducing model complexity in applications where signals are aligned in time. Our optimisation procedure also was shown to be robust can be used in wider applications with low-cost, noisy objective functions."

The ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase-activating protein ASAP1 regulates the dynamics of filamentous actin-based structures, including stress fibers, focal adhesions, and circular dorsal ruffles.

ASAP1 (also known as DEF1, DDEF1, PAG2, AMAP1, and centaurin β4) is a signaling and adapter protein composed of N-BAR, pleckstrin homology (PH), ArfGAP (Arf GTPase Activating Protein), ankyrin repeats, a stretch of eight E/DLPPKP repeats, a proline-rich, and Src homology 3 (SH3) domains. ASAP1 was first discovered on the basis of GAP activity and association with Src and as a differentiation enhancement factor in adipogenic fibroblasts (12Brown M.T. Andrade J. Radhakrishna H.

Chem. 2020; 295: 11303-11315Google Scholar). We and others independently showed that the BAR-PH region of ASAP1 binds to and bundles actin filaments in vitro with similar efficiency as other actin-binding proteins and induces cellular actin remodeling (20Gasilina A. Vitali T. Luo R. Jian X. Randazzo P.A. The ArfGAP ASAP1 controls actin stress fiber organization via its N-BAR domain.iScience. 2019; 22: 166-180Google Scholar, 24Chen P.-W. Billington N. Maron B.Y.

The idea of a specific interaction between the ASAP1 BAR domain and filamentous actin (F-actin) is supported by our observation that exogenous expression of ACAP1, a closely related N-BAR-domain containing ArfGAP, does not rescue the loss of actin structures induced by the reduced expression of ASAP1. However, structural determinants within the BAR domain of ASAP1 that are necessary for F-actin binding have not been defined. Here, guided by homology modeling, we couple cellular and biochemical studies to probe the differences between actin binding to the BAR domain of ASAP1 and binding to the BAR domain of ACAP1 and to define key residue clusters in the BAR domain of ASAP1 that are required for its interaction with the actin filaments. In addition, we examine whether the actin remodeling activity is conserved among the subtypes of the ASAP subgroup of the ArfGAP superfamily. We reveal that a lysine-rich region located on the BAR domain of ASAP1 is necessary for its actin remodeling activity and that all ASAP subtypes participate in maintaining stress fiber alignment. To compare the BAR-PH regions of ACAP1 and ASAP1 for binding to F-actin, we performed a high-speed actin sedimentation assay. Purified His6-tagged ACAP1(residues 1–370) and ASAP1 (residues 1–431) BAR-PH proteins at 2 μM were incubated with increasing (0–25 μM) concentration of filamentous actin for 30 min at room temperature and subjected to ultracentrifugation at 150,000g. Pellets (actin filaments with filament-bound protein) and supernatants (residual globular actin and unbound protein) were resolved on SDS-PAGE. Because the molecular weights of ACAP1 BAR-PH and actin are similar and, therefore, the proteins are difficult to separate by SDS-PAGE, we also detected ACAP1 BAR-PH, fused to hexa-His, by immunoblotting with anti-His6 antibody. Pellet fractions were analyzed as a percentage of total test protein added and plotted (% test protein in the pellet). As we previously reported, the amount of ASAP1 BAR-PH in the pellet increased with increasing concentration of actin filaments (20Gasilina A. Vitali T. Luo R. Jian X. Randazzo P.A. The ArfGAP ASAP1 controls actin stress fiber organization via its N-BAR domain.iScience. 2019; 22: 166-180Google Scholar); in contrast, no ACAP1 BAR-PH was found in the pellet with actin filaments (Fig. 1B). Both ACAPs and ASAPs belong to the BAR domain superfamily, the members of which share a conserved banana-shaped fold (6Carman P.J. Dominguez R. BAR domain proteins-a linkage between cellular membranes, signaling pathways, and the actin cytoskeleton.Biophys. Rev. 2018; 10: 1587-1604Google Scholar); therefore, our observation that in vitro actin-binding activity is not shared between ACAP1 and ASAP1 prompted us to investigate if divergence in primary sequence dictates actin remodeling activity of ASAP1. Primary literature suggests that some non-CH domain actin-binding proteins, such as pacsin2 (8Kostan J. Salzer U. Orlova A. Törö I. Hodnik V. Senju Y. Zou J. Schreiner C. Steiner J. Meriläinen J.

Chem. 2011; 286: 30087-30096Google Scholar) employ basic patches, at least in part, in their interaction with the actin filaments. Our original efforts to obtain high-resolution crystal structure of ASAP BAR-PH failed due to inability to obtain diffraction-quality crystals despite our many attempts. †Unpublished observations. In the absence of experimentally derived structural information, we built a homology model of ASAP1 BAR-PH using crystal structure of ACAP1 BAR-PH as a template (24Chen P.-W. Billington N. Maron B.Y. Sload J.A. Chinthalapudi K. Heissler S.M. The BAR domain of the Arf GTPase-activating protein ASAP1 directly binds actin filaments.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 11303-11315Google Scholar). Five lysine-rich clusters were identified from the homology model, indicated as 1 to 5 (Fig. 1, C and D). To test for a role in actin binding, we introduced mutations into cDNA that would result in replacing lysine with glutamate (charge reversal) or alanine (charge neutralization) (Fig. S1B). Of the mutants generated, six of nine were useful for testing the hypothesis. Two mutants, [K101A, K105A]ASAP1-BAR-PH-His6 and [K159A, K163A, K164A] ASAP1-BAR-PH-His6, did not express despite varying induction temperature and duration, media formulation, and IPTG concentration. For the rest of the mutants, we assessed changes in stability by conducting gel-based thermal stability assay, which allows for robust quantitative assessment of protein behavior (29Jafari R. Almqvist H. Axelsson H. Ignatushchenko M. Lundbäck T. Nordlund P. Martinez Molina D. The cellular thermal shift assay for evaluating drug target interactions in cells.Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9: 2100-2122Google Scholar). The melting temperature for [K229E, K231E, K232E] ASAP1-BAR-PH-His6 triple mutant could not be determined, and this mutant was not used for further analysis. The melting temperatures of [K75E, K76E, K79E] ASAP1-BAR-PH-His6, [K75A, K76A, K79A] ASAP1-BAR-PH-His6 triple mutants, [K283E, K284E] ASAP1-BAR-PH-His6 double mutant, [K283A, K284A] ASAP1-BAR-PH-His6 double, and [K229A, K231A, K232A] ASAP1-BAR-PH-His6 triple mutant were similar to WT protein ranging from 49 to 52 °C, and the melting temperature of [K159E, K162E, K164E] ASAP1-BAR-PH-His6 was 47 °C ± 0.5 deg. C, somewhat lower than other mutants or the WT protein. These six mutants were used for further analysis. To evaluate the effects of mutations on binding to the actin filaments, we performed high-speed actin cosedimentation assays (Fig. 2, A and B). Cluster 1 mutants and cluster 2 mutants bound less efficiently than did the WT protein, with the mutant [K75E, K76E, K79E] having the most severe defect. Other mutants bound F-actin to the same extent as WT. These results suggested that the lysine clusters [75, 76, 79] and [159, 163, 164] were important for binding to the actin filaments. We then assessed the effects of the mutations on the ability of ASAP1 BAR-PH to crosslink actin filaments into bundles. Using a fluorescence-based actin bundling assay, wherein formed bundles can be visualized by fluorescent phalloidin staining, we determined that both Ala and Glu triple mutants of cluster 1 [K75, K76, K79] produced fewer bundles than BAR-PH WT (Fig. 2C). Cluster 2 [K159E, K163E, K164E] ASAP1-BAR-PH-His6 triple mutant also had reduced bundling efficiency. As an independent control, we used the [K283, K284] double mutants. We hypothesized that since this cluster is not important for actin binding based on our high-speed sedimentation data, mutating these residues should not affect the formation of actin bundles. Indeed, both [K283A, K284A] ASAP1-BAR-PH-His6 and [K283E, K284E] ASAP1-BAR-PH-His6 double mutants formed bundles that were comparable to the WT protein. We then examined the effect of the mutations on cellular behavior of ASAP1 BAR-PH. Previously, we and others independently showed that exogenous expression of the isolated BAR-PH region of ASAP1 leads to deregulated bundling of actin, resulting in numerous actin-rich protrusions and microspikes (24Chen P.-W. Billington N. Maron B.Y. Sload J.A. Chinthalapudi K. Heissler S.M. The BAR domain of the Arf GTPase-activating protein ASAP1 directly binds actin filaments.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 11303-11315Google Scholar), thickening of cortical actin, and elongated cell shape (20Gasilina A. Vitali T. Luo R. Jian X. Randazzo P.A. The ArfGAP ASAP1 controls actin stress fiber organization via its N-BAR domain.iScience. 2019; 22: 166-180Google Scholar). We introduced mutations into the cDNA in a mammalian expression vector for FLAG epitope-tagged ASAP1 BAR-PH that changes lysines in clusters 1, 2, and 4 as indicated in Figure 3. The proteins were expressed in a human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS, which is characterized by its well-defined actin stress fiber morphology, to compare the effect of mutants to the WT BAR-PH. We transfected the cells with the empty vector or FLAG-tagged WT BAR-PH or mutants, replated the cells on fibronectin 24 h posttransfection, and costained them with anti-FLAG antibody and fluorescent phalloidin for filamentous actin. As shown in Figure 3A, F-actin and F-actin inset panels, exogenous expression of WT BAR-PH (WT) produced characteristic F-actin-filled protrusions, with 73 ± 2% of FLAG-positive cells displaying actin protrusions (Fig. 3B) compared to 6 ± 1% of cells transfected with the empty vector. In contrast, cells expressing the FLAG-ASAP1 [K75A, K76A, K79A, 1–431] and FLAG-ASAP1 [K75E, K76E, K79E, 1–431] triple mutants led to distinct actin protrusions in only 27 ± 1% and 22 ± 4% of cells, respectively. The number and length of actin protrusions per cell was also reduced (Fig. 3B). Cells expressing FLAG-[K159A, K163A, K164A] ASAP1-BAR-PH and FLAG-[K159E, K163E, K164E] ASAP1-BAR-PH had actin protrusions in 34 ± 0.3% and 38 ± 9% of the cells, respectively. We also noted that despite many transfection attempts using several plasmid preparations, the efficiency of expressing FLAG-[K159A, K163A, K164A] ASAP1-BAR-PH was less than 15% than that of the other mutants. Combined with the lack of soluble recombinant expression for this mutant, this result indicates that [K159, K163, K164] residue cluster may be important for folding and stability of ASAP1 BAR-PH or its expression may also be toxic to cells. The double mutants [K283A, K284A]ASAP1-BAR-PH and [K283E, K284E]ASAP1-BAR-PH, which did not display any defect in in vitro assays of actin binding and bundling also did not display any appreciable defect on cellular actin remodeling. Representative images for both charge neutralizing A and charge reversal E mutants show robust actin-filled protrusions (Fig. 3A) in U2OS cells, with 71 ± 1% and 75 ± 5% of FLAG-positive cells exhibiting actin protrusions (Fig. 3B). The cells overexpressing mutants presented with varying degrees of cell shape changes, as judged by the length-to-width ratios. Wild type and [K283, K284]ASAP1-BAR-PH mutants had similar increases in length (cell elongation) compared to the empty vector expressing cells, while [K75, K76, K79]ASAP1-BAR-PH and [K159, K163, K164]ASAP1-BAR-PH triple mutant-expressing cells exhibited cell shape comparable to those transfected with the empty vector plasmid. Taken together, our in vitro biochemical and cellular data suggest that cluster 1 [K75, K76, K79] and cluster 2 [K159, K163, K164] are important for the interaction of ASAP1 BAR-PH with filamentous actin. Having identified a role for cluster 1 for the effect of ASAP1 BAR-PH on actin in vitro and cells, we sampled around this patch to probe if adjacent residues participate in the interaction with the actin filaments. The second round of mutants, single mutants Q72E, R68A and triple mutants [Q72E, Y82F, N83D] ASAP1-BAR-PH-His6, [Q72A, Y82A, N83A] ASAP1-BAR-PH-His6, [R68E, K156E, K159E] ASAP1-BAR-PH-His6, and [K153A, K156A, K159A] ASAP1-BAR-PH-His6, designated as cluster 1b in Figure 4A were subjected to thermal stability assays as before. As shown in Figure 4B, R68A single mutant had a significantly lower melting temperature (Tm) than the WT BAR-PH in this assay: 44 °C ± 3 deg. C versus 53 °C ± 1 deg. C. [R68E, K156E, K159E] ASAP1-BAR-PH-His6 triple mutant likewise exhibited decreased stability, with a melting temperature of 43 °C ± 0.5 deg. C. Therefore, these two mutants were not considered for further characterization. The melting temperatures of [K153A, K156A, K159A] ASAP1-BAR-PH-His6, [Q72A, Y82A, N83A] ASAP1-BAR-PH-His6, [Q72E, Y82F, N83D] ASAP1-BAR-PH-His6 triple mutants, and Q72E single mutant were comparable to that of the WT BAR-PH (Fig. 4C). The mutants in the resulting group were assessed for their ability to bind and bundle filamentous actin (Fig. 4D). We found that maximum binding of [Q72A, Y82A, N83A] ASAP1-BAR-PH-His6 was 30% less than that of WT protein. Other mutants were similar to WT protein. We then used a fluorescence-based actin bundling assay to compare cluster 1a [K75, K76, K79] and cluster 1b [Q72, Y83, N83] side-by-side. As shown in Figure 4E, incubation of WT BAR-PH with actin filaments leads to cross-linking of filaments into bundles. In the presence of charge reversing or charge neutralizing [K75, K76, K79] triple mutant, actin filaments do not appear to bundle efficiently, as we also present in Figure 2B, appearing as short loose patches. In the presence of [Q72A, Y82A, N83A] ASAP1-BAR-PH-His6 triple mutant, which had mild decrease in its ability to bind actin filaments, cross-linking of actin was also inefficient, with fewer bundles per field than the WT BAR-PH. [Q72E, Y82F, N83D] ASAP1-BAR-PH-His6 triple mutant, which exhibited no defects in actin binding activity, produced long, but qualitatively less bright bundles, indicating a defect in cross-linking activity. Using the confocal laser scanning microscopy images from the bundling assay, we determined fluorescent intensity across bundles as a readout of bundling efficiency. We plotted the fluorescence intensity of line scans across individual bundles to quantify differences in actin bundling activity of mutants. As summarized in intensity line scan plot in Figure 4E, compared to the WT BAR-PH (black line), mutants of both [K75, K76, K79] and [Q72, Y83, N83] clusters produced actin bundles of lower fluorescence intensity (magenta and green lines). Taken together these data indicate that [Q72, Y83, N83] cluster, adjacent to the [K75, K76, K79] cluster, aids in cross-linking of actin filaments into bundles. Our results with truncated proteins both in vitro and in cells indicated that the lysine rich cluster including K75, K76, and K79 was critical for ASAP1 regulation of actin. To further test the hypothesis, we examined the activity of ASAP1 and the mutant to support stress fiber formation in cells (20Gasilina A. Vitali T. Luo R. Jian X. Randazzo P.A. The ArfGAP ASAP1 controls actin stress fiber organization via its N-BAR domain.iScience. 2019; 22: 166-180Google Scholar, 22Chen P.-W. Jian X. Heissler S.M. Le K. Luo R. Jenkins L.M. Nagy A. Moss J. Sellers J.R. Randazzo P.A. The arf GTPase-activating protein, ASAP1, binds nonmuscle myosin 2A to control remodeling of the actomyosin network.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 7517-7526Google Scholar). Using lentivirus-mediated transduction, we created stable U2OS cell lines, expressing empty vector, HA epitope tagged full-length (open reading frame only) WT ASAP1 (HA-ASAP1), or HA-ASAP1 [K75E, K76E, K79E] under a tetracycline-inducible promoter. We transfected the cell lines with control DICER substrate RNA duplex (diCtrl) or RNA duplex against the 3′UTR of ASAP1 (diASAP1). After 24 h, we induced the expression of empty vector and HA-tagged ASAP1 proteins with doxycycline or left the cells uninduced. After an additional 48 h, the cells were harvested for immunoblotting or processed for immunofluorescence. To assess knockdown efficiency, the cell lysates were resolved on SDS-PAGE, transferred on nitrocellulose membranes and probed with ASAP1 antibody to check knockdown efficiency, anti-HA tag antibody to check the levels of transgene induction in the presence of doxycycline, and GAPDH as a loading control. Immunoblot in Figure 5A shows efficient knockdown of ASAP1 using ASAP1 diRNA (diASAP1) across all cell groups (panel ASAP1). Addition of doxycycline (+) induces expression of the WT or mutant ASAP1 proteins (panel HA). Appearance of doublet bands in control diRNA-treated cells (diCtrl) in panels probed with ASAP1 antibody indicates endogenous ASAP1 and transgenic ASAP1 expression. ‡The cDNA for ASAP1a (nm_001362924.1), which has a 54-amino acid exon in the proline rich region not present in ASAP1b, was expressed under control of the tet promoter. Endogenously expressed protein was primarily ASAP1b. The additional 54 amino acid residues with the tag account for the difference in migration of the ectopically expressed and endogenous ASAP1. To assess the effect of transgenes on stress fiber organization, the cells were replated on fibronectin-coated coverslips for 5.5 h in serum-free media, fixed, stained with fluorescent phalloidin, and imaged by confocal microscopy. We then quantified the number of actin fibers greater than 2.2 μm in length per cell using the Ridge Detection plugin in ImageJ (see “Experimental procedures”) (30Steger C. An unbiased detector of curvilinear structures.IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell. 1998; 20: 113-125Google Scholar). Cells stably transduced with empty vector and transfected with control diCtrl show robust stress fiber network with or without addition of doxycycline (Fig. 5B, panel empty vector). Knockdown of ASAP1 (diASAP1) leads to reduction of stress fibers (open arrowheads), and this effect cannot be rescued by inducing the expression of the empty vector with doxycycline (Figs. 5B and S2). In comparison, expression of WT full length ASAP1 (HA-ASAP1) in cells treated with ASAP1 diRNA and doxycycline rescues the stress fiber network (Fig. 5B, panel HA-ASAP1, closed arrowheads). Expression of cluster 1 mutant full-length ASAP1 (HA-ASAP1 [K75E, K76E, K79E]) did not rescue the loss of stress fibers; instead, the mutant may have functioned as a dominant negative reducing actin fiber formation in cells having endogenous ASAP1 present. Taken together, these results suggest that the BAR domain of ASAP1 is required for the maintenance and development of stress fibers and further support our hypothesis that [K75, K76, K79] cluster is important for ASAP1 interaction with actin. ASAP proteins fall into the ArfGAP family of proteins. Three main subtypes — ASAP1 (DEF1, DDEF1, centaurin β4, PAG2, or AMAP1), ASAP2 (PAP, PAG3, or DDEF2), and ASAP3 (DDEFL1 or UPLC1) — are known to exist. All three contain N-BAR, PH, ArfGAP, ankyrin repeat, and proline rich domain, but ASAP1 and 2 also contain C-terminal SH3 domain. Both ASAP1 and ASAP3 associate with focal adhesion and circular dorsal ruffles and control levels of filamentous actin in cells, but very little is known about the role of ASAP2 in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (31Randazzo P.A. Andrade J. Miura K. Brown M.T. Long Y.Q. Stauffer S. Roller P. Cooper J.A. The Arf GTPase-activating protein ASAP1 regulates the actin cytoskeleton.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W4211081363,"Excess fat is a risk factor for many chronic diseases which can lead to premature mortality. Many studies have proposed predictive equations for body fat mass and body fat mass percentage based on anthropometric measures in relation to age and sex. However, the use of these predictive equations on other subject samples may not be relevant. Our objective is to assess whether the predictive equations proposed in the literature are generalizable to any population. We obtained fat mass and fat percentage on a reference population using Absorptiometry DXA. The predictive equations were applied to our population and the mean and individual differences between actual and estimated values were obtained. Predictive equations obtained from a reduced number of subjects have a very high Standard Error of Estimate (>3) and therefore their accuracy is not acceptable. Only the formulae established from a large number of individuals allow the estimation of values whose Standard Error of Estimate is less than 3. These equations, thanks to the large sample size, include a sufficiently large variability in anthropometric measurements covering the diversity of anthropometric values for the same fat value. However, predictive equations based on a large sample size, while exhibiting no current difference in variances, can show a shift in mean values. This mean-shift is the result of differences in DXA devices and needs to be corrected. It means that DXA values from a few individuals in the population under study must be obtained to calculate a corrective factor."
https://openalex.org/W4211194742,"This study investigated the effect of five post-weaning supplementation strategies and two weaning weight groups on long-term growth, puberty and pregnancy percentage of Brahman crossbred heifers. Early-weaned (118 ± 6 kg liveweight) and normally-weaned (183 ± 6 kg liveweight) heifers were allocated to group pens (n = 4 and n = 5/pen for early- and normally-weaned respectively) and offered one of five levels of post-weaning protein supplementation: 0, 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 g of supplement/kg liveweight.day with ad libitum access to a low quality sabi grass (Urochloa mosambicensis) hay during the first dry season (169 days) after weaning. After the post-weaning supplementation period, all heifers grazed the same pastures as a single mob until the end of the experiment and were exposed to fertile bulls from January to May 2016. During the first dry season, supplement intake had a positive linear effect on liveweight gain and hip width gain with no difference in the response between weaning groups. Overall, heifers with higher supplement intakes (i.e. 5 and 10 g/kg) had higher hip height gain (P < 0.005), hip width gain (P < 0.001), body condition score (P < 0.001), and concentration of insulin-like growth factor-1 (P = 0.001), triiodothyronine (P = 0.04) and insulin (P = 0.05) in plasma compared to unsupplemented heifers. These changes resulted in thicker proliferative and hypertrophic zones (both P = 0.03) of the tuber coxae growth plate, larger diameter of terminal hypertrophic chondrocytes (both P = 0.004) at the end of the post-weaning supplementation period when comparing the highest level of supplementation with unsupplemented group. Unsupplemented heifers from both weaning weight groups demonstrated compensatory liveweight gain over the first wet season while evidence of catch-up growth in skeletal dimensions was observed in the second wet season. The main determining factor for pregnancy status of two-year-old Brahman crossbred heifers was pre-mating liveweight (P < 0.001), the pre-mating liveweight was in turn affected by post-weaning supplementation (P = 0.02) or weaning weight group (P < 0.001). This study further demonstrated the positive relationship between premating weight and the occurrence of pregnancy, with an approximate 300 kg pre-mating liveweight required to achieve approximately 80% (67.1-90.3% for a 95% confidence interval) probability of pregnancy in two-year-old Brahman crossbred heifers mated for 4 months."
https://openalex.org/W4211239737,"Throughout the world social isolation and loneliness are common and both have several adverse impacts on health and wellbeing. We are designed to live in close-knit communities and we thrive in close co-operation, however, modern life isolates us from others. To reduce the burden of loneliness and social isolation we need to find strategies to reconnect people to each other, their place and provide a common purpose. Social movements aim to create healthier communities by connecting people to each other and giving people a common purpose. Interventions which create a social movement appear to be effective at engaging substantial portions of a community, however, it remains unclear why individuals are attracted to these initiatives, and if such reasons differ by sociodemographic characteristics. This study combined qualitative and quantitative methods to understand what motivated (different) people to take part in a social movement based intervention. This study suggests that it is not one but a combination of reasons people engage in interventions of this nature. This diversity needs to be acknowledged when promoting and communicating these interventions to potential participants to maximise engagement. Promoting an end reward or health/fitness may not be the most effective way to promote interventions to a large proportion of people. Instead, communications should be centred around what people value (i.e., being with their friends, doing what they enjoy and are good at)."

The alterations that occur in cardiac lipid and mitochondrial bioenergetics during the development of in utero PVR was unknown. In this study, PVR was induced in pups in utero by exposure of pregnant dams to indomethacin and hypoxia and cardiac lipids, echocardiographic function and cardiomyocyte mitochondrial function were subsequently examined. Perinatal rat pups with PVR exhibited elevated left and right cardiac ventricular internal dimensions and reduced ejection fraction and fractional shortening compared to controls. Cardiac myocytes from these pups exhibited increased glycolytic capacity and glycolytic reserve compared to controls. However, respiration with glucose as substrate was unaltered. Fatty acid oxidation and ATP-insensitive respiration were increased in isolated cardiac myocytes from these pups compared to controls indicating a mitochondrial dysfunction. Although abundance of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes was unaltered, increased trilinoleoyl-lysocardiolipin levels in these pups was observed. A compensatory increase in both cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine content were observed due to increased synthesis of these phospholipids. These data indicate that alterations in cardiac cardiolipin and phospholipid metabolism in PVR rat pups is associated with the mitochondrial bioenergetic and cardiac functional defects observed in their hearts."
https://openalex.org/W4210930044,"Malaria is a life-threatening infectious disease primarily caused by the Plasmodium falciparum parasite. The increasing resistance to current antimalarial drugs and their side effects has led to an urgent need for novel malaria drug targets, such as the P. falciparum cGMP-dependent protein kinase (pfPKG). However, PKG plays an essential regulatory role also in the human host. Human cGMP-dependent protein kinase (hPKG) and pfPKG are controlled by structurally homologous cGMP-binding domains (CBDs). Here, we show that despite the structural similarities between the essential CBDs in pfPKG and hPKG, their respective allosteric networks differ significantly. Through comparative analyses of chemical shift covariance analyses, molecular dynamics simulations, and backbone internal dynamics measurements, we found that conserved allosteric elements within the essential CBDs are wired differently in pfPKG and hPKG to implement cGMP-dependent kinase activation. Such pfPKG versus hPKG rewiring of allosteric networks was unexpected because of the structural similarity between the two essential CBDs. Yet, such finding provides crucial information on which elements to target for selective inhibition of pfPKG versus hPKG, which may potentially reduce undesired side effects in malaria treatments."
https://openalex.org/W4210950801,"Community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTi) is the primary strategy employed to control and eliminate human onchocerciasis in Ethiopia. After long-term mass distribution for onchocerciasis, ivermectin is expected to have additional benefits beyond the envisioned targets by reducing the burden of other co-endemic parasitic infections as to STHs. To date, studies focused on the collateral impact of CDTi on STH in Ethiopia are scanty. Two community-based cross-sectional surveys (baseline in 1997 and post-CDTi in 2017) were conducted to evaluate the impact of long-term CDTi employed to control and eliminate onchocerciasis on the burden of STH infections in Yeki district of southwest Ethiopia. Stool samples were collected and examined using Ritchie`s concentration and Kato-Katz techniques in the baseline and current study, respectively. Overall, 188(38.3%, 95% Confidence interval (CI) 34.1-42.7%) individuals were positive at least for any of the STH species from 491 study participants in the post-CDTi. The prevalence of A. lumbricoides, hookworms, and T. trichiura was 11.2% (95% CI 8.7-14.3%), 16.3% (95% CI 13.3-19.8%), and 29.9% (95% CI 26.1-34.1%), respectively. Individuals aged 5-9 years had a significantly higher prevalence of A. lumbricoides (Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 6.5, 95% CI 1.7-25.4), T. trichuria (AOR 8, 95% CI 2.6-25.1), and any STH infection (AOR 5, 95% CI 1.7-14.7) than those of ≥ 51 years. Also, significantly higher prevalences of T. trichuria infection were observed in individuals aged 10-14 years (AOR 4.1, 95% CI 1.7-9.9), 15-20 years (AOR 3.1, 95% CI 1.2-8.1), 21-30 years (AOR 2.4, 95% CI 1.1-5.5), and 31-40 years (AOR 3.2, 95% CI 1.3-7.5) compared with those of ≥ 51 years. The prevalence of A. lumbricoides was significantly higher in males (AOR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.9). Of the 491 study participants, only data from 400 individuals who had not been involved in a mass drug administration (MDA) with other STH anthelmintics were considered in the comparative analysis. Before CDTi, the prevalence of A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura, hookworm, and any STH infection was 47.1% (95% CI 41.6-52.7%), 3.3% (95% CI 1.8-5.9%), 37.9% (95% CI 32.7-43.5%), and 58.8% (95% CI 53.2-64.1%), respectively. Long-term CDTi considerably reduced the prevalences of A. lumbricoides and hookworm by 76.2% and 56.9%, respectively (p < 0.001). Nonetheless, CDTi did not affect the prevalence of T. trichiura infection and, in contrast, it was significantly higher in the current study (P < 0.001). Overall post-CDTi prevalence of any STH infection was considerably lower than reported in the baseline (p < 0.001). It is evidenced that long-term CDTi for onchocerciasis control and elimination had additional benefits by reducing the prevalence of STH infections specifically of A. lumbricoides and hookworm, but had no impact on infections with T. trichuria. Our finding of additional health benefits of large-scale ivermectin administration taking it will aid to increase positive engagement and sustain participation of communities during MDA campaigns, and strengthen governmental and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) support for the undergoing national onchocerciasis elimination program."
https://openalex.org/W4210956611,"Growth factors became attractive candidates for medium supplementation to further improve the quality of embryo culture and to mimic in vivo nutrition. Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a cytokine influencing the maternal-fetal interface and supporting placental development in mouse and human. It is expressed in epithelial cells of the endometrium under the regulation of estrogens. The factor is already in clinical use and a large clinical trial showed that, if supplemented to an embryo culture medium, it leads to increased survival of embryos, especially in women with previous miscarriages. Animal and cell culture studies on isolated trophectoderm cells support an effect mainly on cellular expansion. Aim of this study was to investigate, if the supplementation of GM-CSF either in a human ART medium or in a mouse optimized medium, leads to a change in cell number and cell lineages in the early pre-implantation mouse embryo. Our data shows that mouse GM-CSF increased total cell numbers with increasing concentrations. This increase of cell number has not been found in embryos cultured in ART media with or without human GM-CSF (hGM-CSF) or in a mouse medium supplemented with different concentrations of hGM-CSF. The changes were caused by a marked difference in TE and primitive endoderm cell numbers but not due to a change in epiblast cell numbers. Additionally, results show an ectopic expression of NANOG among trophectoderm cells in both, human ART media (with and without GM-CSF) and at increasing concentrations in the mouse and the human GM-CSF supplemented media. In conclusion, we could show that GM-CSF has an effect on cell identity in mice, which might probably also occur in the human. Therefore, we would like to rare awareness that the use of supplements without proper research could bare risks for the embryo itself and probably also in the post-implantation phase."
https://openalex.org/W4210983858,"Filoviruses are emerging pathogens that cause acute fever with high fatality rate and present a global public health threat. During the 2013-2016 Ebola virus outbreak, genome sequencing allowed the study of virus evolution, mutations affecting pathogenicity and infectivity, and tracing the viral spread. In 2018, early sequence identification of the Ebolavirus as EBOV in the Democratic Republic of the Congo supported the use of an Ebola virus vaccine. However, field-deployable sequencing methods are needed to enable a rapid public health response. Resequencing microarrays (RMA) are a targeted method to obtain genomic sequence on clinical specimens rapidly, and sensitively, overcoming the need for extensive bioinformatic analysis. This study presents the design and initial evaluation of an ebolavirus resequencing microarray (Ebolavirus-RMA) system for sequencing the major genomic regions of four Ebolaviruses that cause disease in humans. The design of the Ebolavirus-RMA system is described and evaluated by sequencing repository samples of three Ebolaviruses and two EBOV variants. The ability of the system to identify genetic drift in a replicating virus was achieved by sequencing the ebolavirus glycoprotein gene in a recombinant virus cultured under pressure from a neutralizing antibody. Comparison of the Ebolavirus-RMA results to the Genbank database sequence file with the accession number given for the source RNA and Ebolavirus-RMA results compared to Next Generation Sequence results of the same RNA samples showed up to 99% agreement."

https://openalex.org/W4211128485,"Vaccines are one of the most cost-effective tools for improving human health and well-being. The impact of a vaccine on population health is partly determined by its coverage rate, the proportion of eligible individuals vaccinated. Coverage rate is a function of the vaccine presentation and the population in which that presentation is deployed. This population includes not only the individuals vaccinated, but also the logistics and healthcare systems responsible for vaccine delivery. Because vaccine coverage rates remain below targets in many settings, vaccine manufacturers and purchasers have a shared interest in better understanding the relationship between vaccine presentation, population characteristics, and coverage rate. While there have been some efforts to describe this relationship, existing research and tools are limited in their ability to quantify coverage rate changes across a broad set of antigens, vaccine presentations, and geographies. In this article, we present a method for estimating the impact of improved vaccine technologies on vaccination coverage rates. It is designed for use with low- and middle-income country vaccination programs. This method uses publicly available data and simple calculations based on probability theory to generate coverage rate values. We first present the conceptual framework and mathematical approach. Using a Microsoft Excel-based implementation, we then apply the method to a vaccine technology in early-stage development: micro-array patch for a measles-rubella vaccine (MR-MAP). Example outputs indicate that a complete switch from the current subcutaneous presentation to MR-MAP in the 73 countries ever eligible for Gavi support would increase overall vaccination coverage by 3.0–4.9 percentage points depending on the final characteristics of the MR-MAP. This change equates to an additional 2.6–4.2 million children vaccinated per year. Our method can be readily extended to other antigens and vaccine technologies to provide quick, low-cost estimates of coverage impact. As vaccine manufacturers and purchasers face increasingly complex decisions, such estimates could facilitate objective comparisons between options and help these decision makers obtain the most value for money."

The exercise emphasizes on the consideration of multiple potential career destinations and routes to those destination. The exercise was designed with the goal of improving participant awareness of options and career planning self-efficacy to improve success and retention of underrepresented minority student participation and retention in STEM.We implemented the Future Life Map exercise with 2 separate groups of under-represented minority undergraduate students pursuing careers in STEM. Participants then completed an anonymous survey to evaluate the exercise and describe the value they derived from completing the Future Life Map.The exercise presentation and its supporting documents were highly rated by participants with >81% of respondents rating it as ""very informative"" (4 or 5 on a 5-point Likert Scale). Participants reported that they were very likely to recommend the exercise to others (25 of 27 participants) and were likely to repeat the activity for their own future decision making (22 participants). Themes that emerged from participant reporting of the value of the exercise were: increased awareness of career and training options, improved understanding of the research required to make informed career/life decisions, and new awareness of specific information about career options under consideration.The Future Life Map exercise was successful in improving participant awareness of career options, career planning ability, and helped participants to feel more empowered.

https://openalex.org/W4211030251,"Orchiepididymitis (OE) is a frequent cause of pediatric emergency department attendance in boys presenting with acute scrotum. The etiology of most episodes of OE remains unclear and there is no consensus regarding the correlation between OE and underlying genitourinary malformations. Whether imaging evaluation should comprise complete urinary tract ultrasonography (US) or voiding cystography is a subject of debate. The aim of this retrospective, single-center study was to analyze i) the number/type of urinary tract malformations detected by US following a first episode of OE in boys with no previously known malformation and ii) the frequency of associated urinary tract infection (UTI). We reviewed the records of 495 boys <16 years presenting to our pediatric emergency department with acute scrotum between January 2012 and December 2017. Patients with incomplete radiological data were excluded. Of 119 boys with a radiologically-confirmed first episode of OE, 99 had a complete urinary tract US and were included in the study. No genitourinary malformation was detected (0%). Urinary cultures showed UTI in 3/98 (3.1%) patients. Mean age at presentation was 9.7 years (standard deviation, 3.9) with a three-peak incidence of OE at 10-13 years, 4-5 years, and during infancy. Conclusion: Complete urinary tract US does not appear to be useful during a first episode of OE in countries with an antenatal US screening rate similar to Switzerland. The very low UTI rate suggests that a urinalysis is sufficient to investigate a first episode of OE and antibiotics should be reserved for positive urinalysis only."

Three conceptually motivated and one empirically motivated factor analysis model of neuropsychological domains were compared based on penalized-likelihood selection criteria and model fit statistics. Two conceptually-motivated models were found to have adequate fit and pattern invariance to function as a measurement model for the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (Penn CNB) anchored neuropsychological battery in NCANDA. Corroboration of previous factor analysis models was obtained, in addition to the identification of an alternative factor model that has higher discriminant capacity for neuropsychological domains hypothesized to be most sensitive to alcohol exposure in human adolescents. The findings support the use of a factor model developed originally for the Penn CNB and a model developed specifically for the NCANDA project. The NCANDA 8-Factor Model has conceptual and empirical advantages that were identified in the current and prior studies. These advantages are particularly valuable when applied in alcohol research settings."

However, neonatal infection related to OHDs has not been studied. The aim of this study was to determine the infection risk of OHDs. This retrospective cohort study enrolled neonates admitted at a children’s hospital in an urban setting from January 2004 to December 2017. Accidental OHDs were compared with in-hospital births, and neonatal infection was assessed. This study also investigated both maternal and neonatal risk factors associated with OHDs. A cohort of 158 OHD neonates was enrolled, of whom 29 (23.2%) were preterm. Prematurity and low birth weight were significantly associated with OHD. Eight neonates in the OHD cohort had a documented infection within the first 72 hours of life, which was 11-fold higher than infections documented for the in-hospital births. Multivariate analysis identified low birth weight as the only factor independently associated with increased risk of infection in OHD neonates. Several specific characteristics of mothers with OHDs were identified. Forty-nine (31%) OHD mothers lacked antenatal care, and 10 (6.3%) were unaware of their pregnancies. The OHD group comprised of more teenage mothers compared to the in-hospital deliveries category. Neonatal infection was more prevalent among OHDs than for in-hospital deliveries, and the infection rate was associated with low birth weight. Hospitalization for further care and observation is suggested for the OHD neonates. Social support should be provided for populations with an increased risk of OHD, such as teenage mothers."
https://openalex.org/W4211179250,"The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) is a common aggregate measure of disability for people with Low Back Pain (LBP). Scores on individual items and the relationship between items of the ODI may help understand the complexity of low back disorders and their response to treatment. In this study, we present a network analysis to explore how individualised physiotherapy or advice might influence individual items of the ODI, and the relationship between those items, at different time points for people with LBP.Data from a randomised controlled trial (n = 300) comparing individualised physiotherapy versus advice for low back pain were used. A network analysis was performed at baseline, 5, 10, 26 and 52 weeks, with the 10 items of the Oswestry Disability Index modelled as continuous variables and treatment group (Individualised Physiotherapy or Advice) modelled as a dichotomous variable. A Mixed Graphical Model was used to estimate associations between variables in the network, while centrality indices (Strength, Closeness and Betweenness) were calculated to determine the importance of each variable.Individualised Physiotherapy was directly related to lower Sleep and Pain scores at all follow-up time points relative to advice, as well as a lower Standing score at 10-weeks, and higher Lifting and Travelling scores at 5-weeks. The strongest associations in the network were between Sitting and Travelling at weeks 5 and 26, between Walking and Standing at week 10, and between Sitting and Standing scores at week 52. ODI items with the highest centrality measures were consistently found to be Pain, Work and Social Life.This study represents the first to understand how individualised physiotherapy or advice differentially altered disability in people with LBP. Individualised Physiotherapy directly reduced Pain and Sleep more effectively than advice, which in turn may have facilitated improvements in other disability items. Through their high centrality measures, Pain may be considered as a candidate therapeutic target for optimising LBP management, while Work and Socialising may need to be addressed via intermediary improvements in lifting, standing, walking, travelling or sleep. Slower (5-week follow-up) improvements in Lifting and Travelling as an intended element of the Individualised Physiotherapy approach did not negatively impact any longer-term outcomes.ACTRN12609000834257."
https://openalex.org/W4211194863,"Intracellular trafficking through the secretory organelles depends on transient interactions between cargo proteins and transport machinery. Cytosolic coat protein complexes capture specific luminal cargo proteins for incorporation into transport vesicles by interacting with them indirectly through a transmembrane adaptor or cargo receptor. Due to their transient nature, it is difficult to study these specific ternary protein interactions just using conventional native co-immunoprecipitation. To overcome this technical challenge, we have applied a crosslinking assay to stabilize the transient and/or weak protein interactions. Here, we describe a protocol of protein crosslinking and co-immunoprecipitation, which was employed to prove the indirect interaction in the endoplasmic reticulum of a luminal secretory protein with a selective subunit of the cytosolic COPII coat through a specific transmembrane cargo receptor. This method can be extended to address other transient ternary interactions between cytosolic proteins and luminal or extracellular proteins through a transmembrane receptor within the endomembrane system."
https://openalex.org/W4211245508,"Pertussis or whooping cough is a vaccine-preventable, highly contagious, respiratory illness caused by Bordetella pertussis or Bordetella parapertussis. Infants and young children have remained most susceptible to pertussis-related morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to investigate pertussis infection and analyze the associated factors involved in the occurrence of the cases.Community-based case-control was conducted in Dahena district, Northwest Ethiopia, from March 27-April 30, 2019. All cases ages 1-18 years old were identified by using the clinical standard case definition of pertussis adopted from World Health Organization (WHO). Data was collected using a structured questionnaire via face-to-face interviews. The data collected was cleaned, coded and entered into Epi info version 7.2.1.0 and exported to SPSS version 23 for statistical analysis. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis were employed to identify predictors. Factors with a p-value of < 0.05 were considered as independent risk factors of pertussis infection in multivariable logistic regression analysis.A total of 122 pertussis cases were enrolled from the Azila cluster of the Dahena district. Of these figures, 64 (52.5%) were females. The overall attack rate (AR) of pertussis cases in the cluster was 8.6/10000 population. The sex-specific AR of females was 8.9/10000 population. The multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that; being unvaccinated 4.17 (AOR, 4.17, 95% CI, 1.914-9.091), contact to cases 2.93 (AOR: 2.93, 95% CI 1.223-6.996), and living in a house with no window 2.6 (AOR: 2.6(95% CI 1.071 to 6.322) were the independent significantly risk factors for pertussis infection.The contributing factor for pertussis infection was associated with case-contact, living in the house without windows and being unvaccinated. Wag Hemra Zone and Dahena district health office should encourage the vaccination activities of the cluster health center and awareness for the community should be practiced to limit disease transmission."
