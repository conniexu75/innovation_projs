https://openalex.org/W2231058499,"Mammalian cortex comprises a variety of cells, but the extent of this cellular diversity is unknown. The authors defined cell types in the primary visual cortex of adult mice using single-cell transcriptomics. This revealed 49 cell types, including 23 GABAergic, 19 glutamatergic and 7 non-neuronal types. Nervous systems are composed of various cell types, but the extent of cell type diversity is poorly understood. We constructed a cellular taxonomy of one cortical region, primary visual cortex, in adult mice on the basis of single-cell RNA sequencing. We identified 49 transcriptomic cell types, including 23 GABAergic, 19 glutamatergic and 7 non-neuronal types. We also analyzed cell type–specific mRNA processing and characterized genetic access to these transcriptomic types by many transgenic Cre lines. Finally, we found that some of our transcriptomic cell types displayed specific and differential electrophysiological and axon projection properties, thereby confirming that the single-cell transcriptomic signatures can be associated with specific cellular properties."
https://openalex.org/W2225726427,"Over the past few years, substantial effort has been put into the functional annotation of variation in human genome sequences. Such annotations can have a critical role in identifying putatively causal variants for a disease or trait among the abundant natural variation that occurs at a locus of interest. The main challenges in using these various annotations include their large numbers and their diversity. Here we develop an unsupervised approach to integrate these different annotations into one measure of functional importance (Eigen) that, unlike most existing methods, is not based on any labeled training data. We show that the resulting meta-score has better discriminatory ability using disease-associated and putatively benign variants from published studies (in both coding and noncoding regions) than the recently proposed CADD score. Across varied scenarios, the Eigen score performs generally better than any single individual annotation, representing a powerful single functional score that can be incorporated in fine-mapping studies."
https://openalex.org/W2230933569,"Dysbiosis is a hallmark of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but it is unclear which specific intestinal bacteria predispose to and which protect from IBD and how they are regulated. Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (Pglyrps) are antibacterial, participate in maintaining intestinal microflora, and modulate inflammatory responses. Mice deficient in any one of the four Pglyrp genes are more sensitive to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, and stools from Pglyrp-deficient mice transferred to wild type (WT) germ-free mice predispose them to much more severe colitis than stools from WT mice. However, the identities of these Pglyrp-regulated bacteria that predispose Pglyrp-deficient mice to colitis or protect WT mice from colitis are not known. Here we identified significant changes in β-diversity of stool bacteria in Pglyrp-deficient mice compared with WT mice. The most consistent changes in microbiome in all Pglyrp-deficient mice were in Bacteroidales, from which we selected four species, two with increased abundance (Prevotella falsenii and Parabacteroides distasonis) and two with decreased abundance (Bacteroides eggerthii and Alistipes finegoldii). We then gavaged WT mice with stock type strains of these species to test the hypothesis that they predispose to or protect from DSS-induced colitis. P. falsenii, P. distasonis, and B. eggerthii all enhanced DSS-induced colitis in both WT mice with otherwise undisturbed intestinal microflora and in WT mice with antibiotic-depleted intestinal microflora. By contrast, A. finegoldii (which is the most abundant species in WT mice) attenuated DSS-induced colitis both in WT mice with otherwise undisturbed intestinal microflora and in WT mice with antibiotic-depleted intestinal microflora, similar to the colitis protective effect of the entire normal microflora. These results identify P. falsenii, P. distasonis, and B. eggerthii as colitis-promoting species and A. finegoldii as colitis-protective species."
https://openalex.org/W2236879788,"Influenza A virus is characterized by high genetic diversity. However, most of what is known about influenza evolution has come from consensus sequences sampled at the epidemiological scale that only represent the dominant virus lineage within each infected host. Less is known about the extent of within-host virus diversity and what proportion of this diversity is transmitted between individuals. To characterize virus variants that achieve sustainable transmission in new hosts, we examined within-host virus genetic diversity in household donor-recipient pairs from the first wave of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic when seasonal H3N2 was co-circulating. Although the same variants were found in multiple members of the community, the relative frequencies of variants fluctuated, with patterns of genetic variation more similar within than between households. We estimated the effective population size of influenza A virus across donor-recipient pairs to be approximately 100-200 contributing members, which enabled the transmission of multiple lineages, including antigenic variants."
https://openalex.org/W2231596722,"Non-invasive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) have demonstrated great promise for neuroprosthetics and assistive devices. Here we aim to investigate methods to combine Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) in an asynchronous Sensory Motor rhythm (SMR)-based BCI. We attempted to classify 4 different executed movements, namely, Right-Arm-Left-Arm-Right-Hand-Left-Hand tasks. Previous studies demonstrated the benefit of EEG-fNIRS combination. However, since normally fNIRS hemodynamic response shows a long delay, we investigated new features, involving slope indicators, in order to immediately detect changes in the signals. Moreover, Common Spatial Patterns (CSPs) have been applied to both EEG and fNIRS signals. 15 healthy subjects took part in the experiments and since 25 trials per class were available, CSPs have been regularized with information from the entire population of participants and optimized using genetic algorithms. The different features have been compared in terms of performance and the dynamic accuracy over trials shows that the introduced methods diminish the fNIRS delay in the detection of changes."

https://openalex.org/W2232595415,"Heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) is a significant and often fatal disease of cultured Atlantic salmon in Norway. The consistent presence of Piscine orthoreovirus (PRV) in HSMI diseased fish along with the correlation of viral load and antigen with development of lesions has supported the supposition that PRV is the etiologic agent of this condition; yet the absence of an in vitro culture system to demonstrate disease causation and the widespread prevalence of this virus in the absence of disease continues to obfuscate the etiological role of PRV with regard to HSMI. In this study, we explore the infectivity and disease causing potential of PRV from western North America—a region now considered endemic for PRV but without manifestation of HSMI—in challenge experiments modeled upon previous reports associating PRV with HSMI. We identified that western North American PRV is highly infective by intraperitoneal injection in Atlantic salmon as well as through cohabitation of both Atlantic and Sockeye salmon. High prevalence of viral RNA in peripheral blood of infected fish persisted for as long as 59 weeks post-challenge. Nevertheless, no microscopic lesions, disease, or mortality could be attributed to the presence of PRV, and only a minor transcriptional induction of the antiviral Mx gene occurred in blood and kidney samples during log-linear replication of viral RNA. Comparative analysis of the S1 segment of PRV identified high similarity between this North American sequence and previous sequences associated with HSMI, suggesting that factors such as viral co-infection, alternate PRV strains, host condition, or specific environmental circumstances may be required to cause this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2239190545,"Although juvenile hormone (JH) is known to prevent insect larval metamorphosis and stimulate adult reproduction, the molecular mechanisms of JH action in insect reproduction remain largely unknown. Earlier, we reported that the JH-receptor complex, composed of methoprene-tolerant and steroid receptor co-activator, acts on mini-chromosome maintenance (Mcm) genes Mcm4 and Mcm7 to promote DNA replication and polyploidy for the massive vitellogenin (Vg) synthesis required for egg production in the migratory locust (Guo, W., Wu, Z., Song, J., Jiang, F., Wang, Z., Deng, S., Walker, V. K., and Zhou, S. (2014) PLoS Genet. 10, e1004702). In this study we have investigated the involvement of cell-division-cycle 6 (Cdc6) in JH-dependent vitellogenesis and oogenesis, as Cdc6 is essential for the formation of prereplication complex. We demonstrate here that Cdc6 is expressed in response to JH and methoprene-tolerant, and Cdc6 transcription is directly regulated by the JH-receptor complex. Knockdown of Cdc6 inhibits polyploidization of fat body and follicle cells, resulting in the substantial reduction of Vg expression in the fat body as well as severely impaired oocyte maturation and ovarian growth. Our data indicate the involvement of Cdc6 in JH pathway and a pivotal role of Cdc6 in JH-mediated polyploidization, vitellogenesis, and oogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2227700557,"The G-quadruplex is a non-canonical DNA structure biologically significant in DNA replication, transcription and telomere stability. To date, only G4s with all guanines originating from the same strand of DNA have been considered in the context of the human nuclear genome. Here, I discuss interstrand topological configurations of G-quadruplex DNA, consisting of guanines from both strands of genomic DNA; an algorithm is presented for predicting such structures. I have identified over 550,000 non-overlapping interstrand G-quadruplex forming sequences in the human genome--significantly more than intrastrand configurations. Functional analysis of interstrand G-quadruplex sites shows strong association with transcription initiation, the results are consistent with the XPB and XPD transcriptional helicases binding only to G-quadruplex DNA with interstrand topology. Interstrand quadruplexes are also enriched in origin of replication sites. Several topology classes of interstrand quadruplex-forming sequences are possible, and different topologies are enriched in different types of structural elements. The list of interstrand quadruplex forming sequences, and the computer program used for their prediction are available at the web address http://moment.utmb.edu/allquads."
https://openalex.org/W2223419060,"Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) carries information on tumor burden. However, the mutation spectrum is different among tumors. This study was designed to examine the utility of ctDNA for monitoring tumor burden based on an individual mutation profile.DNA was extracted from a total of 176 samples, including pre- and post-operational plasma, primary tumors, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), from 44 individuals with colorectal tumor who underwent curative resection of colorectal tumors, as well as nine healthy individuals. Using a panel of 50 cancer-associated genes, tumor-unique mutations were identified by comparing the single nucleotide variants (SNVs) from tumors and PBMCs with an Ion PGM sequencer. A group of the tumor-unique mutations from individual tumors were designated as individual marker mutations (MMs) to trace tumor burden by ctDNA using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). From these experiments, three major objectives were assessed: (a) Tumor-unique mutations; (b) mutation spectrum of a tumor; and (c) changes in allele frequency of the MMs in ctDNA after curative resection of the tumor.A total of 128 gene point mutations were identified in 27 colorectal tumors. Twenty-six genes were mutated in at least 1 sample, while 14 genes were found to be mutated in only 1 sample, respectively. An average of 2.7 genes were mutated per tumor. Subsequently, 24 MMs were selected from SNVs for tumor burden monitoring. Among the MMs found by ddPCR with > 0.1% variant allele frequency in plasma DNA, 100% (8 out of 8) exhibited a decrease in post-operation ctDNA, whereas none of the 16 MMs found by ddPCR with < 0.1% variant allele frequency in plasma DNA showed a decrease.This panel of 50 cancer-associated genes appeared to be sufficient to identify individual, tumor-unique, mutated ctDNA markers in cancer patients. The MMs showed the clinical utility in monitoring curatively-treated colorectal tumor burden if the allele frequency of MMs in plasma DNA is above 0.1%."
https://openalex.org/W2232442412,"Brain entropy (BEN) mapping provides a novel approach to characterize brain temporal dynamics, a key feature of human brain. Using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI), reliable and spatially distributed BEN patterns have been identified in normal brain, suggesting a potential use in clinical populations since temporal brain dynamics and entropy may be altered in disease conditions. The purpose of this study was to characterize BEN in multiple sclerosis (MS), a neurodegenerative disease that affects millions of people. Since currently there is no cure for MS, developing treatment or medication that can slow down its progression represents a high research priority, for which validating a brain marker sensitive to disease and the related functional impairments is essential. Because MS can start long time before any measurable symptoms and structural deficits, assessing the dynamic brain activity and correspondingly BEN may provide a critical way to study MS and its progression. Because BEN is new to MS, we aimed to assess BEN alterations in the relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients using a patient versus control design, to examine the correlation of BEN to clinical measurements, and to check the correlation of BEN to structural brain measures which have been more often used in MS studies. As compared to controls, RRMS patients showed increased BEN in motor areas, executive control area, spatial coordinating area, and memory system. Increased BEN was related to greater disease severity as measured by the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and greater tissue damage as indicated by the mean diffusivity. Patients also showed decreased BEN in other places, which was associated with less disability or fatigue, indicating a disease-related BEN re-distribution. Our results suggest BEN as a novel and useful tool for characterizing RRMS."
https://openalex.org/W2228018620,"Objectives To determine whether fetuses that slow in growth but are then born appropriate for gestational age (AGA, birthweight >10th centile) demonstrate ultrasound and clinical evidence of placental insufficiency. Methods Prospective longitudinal study of 48 pregnancies reaching term and a birthweight >10th centile. We estimated fetal weight by ultrasound at 28 and 36 weeks, and recorded birthweight to determine the relative change in customised weight across two timepoints: 28–36 weeks and 28 weeks-birth. The relative change in weight centiles were correlated with fetoplacental Doppler findings performed at 36 weeks. We also examined whether a decline in growth trajectory in fetuses born AGA was associated with operative deliveries performed for suspected intrapartum compromise. Results The middle cerebral artery pulsatility index (MCA-PI) showed a linear association with fetal growth trajectory. Lower MCA-PI readings (reflecting greater diversion of blood supply to the brain) were significantly associated with a decline in fetal growth, both between 28–36 weeks (p = 0.02), and 28 weeks-birth (p = 0.0002). The MCA-PI at 36 weeks was significantly higher among those with a relative weight centile fall <20%, compared to those with a moderate centile fall of 20–30% (mean MCA-PI 1.94 vs 1.61; p<0.05), or severe centile fall of >30% (mean MCA-PI 1.94 vs 1.56; p<0.01). Of 43 who labored, operative delivery for suspected intrapartum fetal compromise was required in 12 cases; 9/18 (50%) cases where growth slowed, and 3/25 (12%) where growth trajectory was maintained (p = 0.01). Conclusions Slowing in growth across the third trimester among fetuses subsequently born AGA was associated with ultrasound and clinical features of placental insufficiency. Such fetuses may represent an under-recognised cohort at increased risk of stillbirth."
https://openalex.org/W2228804992,"Chlamydia trachomatis causes a predominantly asymptomatic, but generally inflammatory, genital infection that is associated with an increased risk for HIV acquisition. Endocervical epithelial cells provide the major niche for this obligate intracellular bacterium in women, and the endocervix is also a tissue in which HIV transmission can occur. The mechanism by which CT infection enhances HIV susceptibility at this site, however, is not well understood. Utilizing the A2EN immortalized endocervical epithelial cell line grown on cell culture inserts, we evaluated the direct role that CT-infected epithelial cells play in facilitating HIV transmission events. We determined that CT infection significantly enhanced the apical-to-basolateral migration of cell-associated, but not cell-free, HIVBaL, a CCR5-tropic strain of virus, across the endocervical epithelial barrier. We also established that basolateral supernatants from CT-infected A2EN cells significantly enhanced HIV replication in peripheral mononuclear cells and a CCR5+ T cell line. These results suggest that CT infection of endocervical epithelial cells could facilitate both HIV crossing the mucosal barrier and subsequent infection or replication in underlying target cells. Our studies provide a mechanism by which this common STI could potentially promote the establishment of founder virus populations and the maintenance of local HIV reservoirs in the endocervix. Development of an HIV/STI co-infection model also provides a tool to further explore the role of other sexually transmitted infections in enhancing HIV acquisition."
https://openalex.org/W2222912452,"Painful diabetic neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes mellitus which is poorly controlled by conventional analgesics. This study investigates if treatment with an heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) inducer, cobalt protoporphyrin IX (CoPP), could modulate the allodynia and hyperalgesia induced by diabetes and enhanced the antinociceptive effects of morphine. In a diabetic mice model induced by the injection of streptozotocin (STZ), we evaluated the antiallodynic and antihyperalgesic effects produced by the intraperitoneal administration of 5 and 10 mg/kg of CoPP at several days after its administration. The antinociceptive actions produced by the systemic administration of morphine alone or combined with CoPP were also evaluated. In addition, the effects of CoPP treatment on the expression of HO-1, the microglial activation marker (CD11b/c), the inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) and μ-opioid receptors (MOR), were also assessed. Our results showed that the administration of 10 mg/kg of CoPP during 5 consecutive days completely blocked the mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity induced by diabetes. These effects are accompanied by the increased spinal cord, dorsal root ganglia and sciatic nerve protein levels of HO-1. In addition, the STZ-induced activation of microglia and overexpression of NOS2 in the spinal cord were inhibited by CoPP treatment. Furthermore, the antinociceptive effects of morphine were enhanced by CoPP treatment and reversed by the administration of an HO-1 inhibitor, tin protoporphyrin IX (SnPP). The spinal cord expression of MOR was also increased by CoPP treatment in diabetic mice. In conclusion, our data provide the first evidence that the induction of HO-1 attenuated STZ-induced painful diabetic neuropathy and enhanced the antinociceptive effects of morphine via inhibition of microglia activation and NOS2 overexpression as well as by increasing the spinal cord levels of MOR. This study proposes the administration of CoPP alone or combined with morphine as an interesting therapeutic approach for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy."
https://openalex.org/W2233517494,"Purpose The aim of the current study is to describe the functionality of free software developed for energy system contributions and energy expenditure calculation during exercise, namely GEDAE-LaB. Methods Eleven participants performed the following tests: 1) a maximal cycling incremental test to measure the ventilatory threshold and maximal oxygen uptake (O2max); 2) a cycling workload constant test at moderate domain (90% ventilatory threshold); 3) a cycling workload constant test at severe domain (110% O2max). Oxygen uptake and plasma lactate were measured during the tests. The contributions of the aerobic (AMET), anaerobic lactic (LAMET), and anaerobic alactic (ALMET) systems were calculated based on the oxygen uptake during exercise, the oxygen energy equivalents provided by lactate accumulation, and the fast component of excess post-exercise oxygen consumption, respectively. In order to assess the intra-investigator variation, four different investigators performed the analyses independently using GEDAE-LaB. A direct comparison with commercial software was also provided. Results All subjects completed 10 min of exercise at moderate domain, while the time to exhaustion at severe domain was 144 ± 65 s. The AMET, LAMET, and ALMET contributions during moderate domain were about 93, 2, and 5%, respectively. The AMET, LAMET, and ALMET contributions during severe domain were about 66, 21, and 13%, respectively. No statistical differences were found between the energy system contributions and energy expenditure obtained by GEDAE-LaB and commercial software for both moderate and severe domains (P > 0.05). The ICC revealed that these estimates were highly reliable among the four investigators for both moderate and severe domains (all ICC ≥ 0.94). Conclusion These findings suggest that GEDAE-LaB is a free software easily comprehended by users minimally familiarized with adopted procedures for calculations of energetic profile using oxygen uptake and lactate accumulation during exercise. By providing availability of the software and its source code we hope to facilitate future related research."
https://openalex.org/W2238692935,"Identification of factors contributing to the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is crucial for developing new treatments. An increase in the levels of protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI), a multifaceted endoplasmic reticulum resident chaperone, has been demonstrated in human smokers, presumably as a protective adaptation to cigarette smoke (CS) exposure. We found a similar increase in the levels of PDI in the murine model of COPD. We also found abnormally high levels (4-6 times) of oxidized and sulfenilated forms of PDI in the lungs of murine smokers compared with non-smokers. PDI oxidation progressively increases with age. We begin to delineate the possible role of an increased ratio of oxidized PDI in the age-related onset of COPD by investigating the impact of exposure to CS radicals, such as acrolein (AC), hydroxyquinones (HQ), peroxynitrites (PN), and hydrogen peroxide, on their ability to induce unfolded protein response (UPR) and their effects on the structure and function of PDIs. Exposure to AC, HQ, PN, and CS resulted in cysteine and tyrosine nitrosylation leading to an altered three-dimensional structure of the PDI due to a decrease in helical content and formation of a more random coil structure, resulting in protein unfolding, inhibition of PDI reductase and isomerase activity in vitro and in vivo, and subsequent induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress response. Addition of glutathione prevented the induction of UPR, and AC and HQ induced structural changes in PDI. Exposure to PN and glutathione resulted in conjugation of PDI possibly at active site tyrosine residues. The findings presented here propose a new role of PDI in the pathogenesis of COPD and its age-dependent onset."
https://openalex.org/W2289081239,"Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 1 (ACSL1) plays a key role in fatty acid metabolism. To identify novel transcriptional modulators of ACSL1, we examined ACSL1 expression in liver tissues of hamsters fed a normal diet, a high fat diet, or a high cholesterol and high fat diet (HCHFD). Feeding hamsters HCHFD markedly reduced hepatic Acsl1 mRNA and protein levels as well as acyl-CoA synthetase activity. Decreases in Acsl1 expression strongly correlated with reductions in hepatic Srebp2 mRNA level and mature Srebp2 protein abundance. Conversely, administration of rosuvastatin (RSV) to hamsters increased hepatic Acsl1 expression. These new findings were reproduced in mice treated with RSV or fed the HCHFD. Furthermore, the RSV induction of acyl-CoA activity in mouse liver resulted in increases in plasma and hepatic cholesterol ester concentrations and reductions in free cholesterol amounts. Investigations on different ACSL1 transcript variants in HepG2 cells revealed that the mRNA expression of C-ACSL1 was specifically regulated by the sterol regulatory element (SRE)-binding protein (SREBP) pathway, and RSV treatment increased the C-ACSL1 abundance from a minor mRNA species to an abundant transcript. We analyzed 5′-flanking sequence of exon 1C of the human ACSL1 gene and identified one putative SRE site. By performing a promoter activity assay and DNA binding assays, we firmly demonstrated the key role of this SRE motif in SREBP2-mediated activation of C-ACSL1 gene transcription. Finally, we demonstrated that knockdown of endogenous SREBP2 in HepG2 cells lowered ACSL1 mRNA and protein levels.

https://openalex.org/W2229518952,"The ""gold standard"" for assessing mucosal immunity after vaccination with poliovirus vaccines consists in measuring virus excretion in stool after challenge with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). This testing is time and resource intensive, and development of alternative methods is a priority for accelerating polio eradication. We therefore evaluated circulating antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) as a potential means to evaluate mucosal immunity to poliovirus vaccine.199 subjects, aged 10 years, and previously immunized repeatedly with OPV, were selected. Subjects were assigned to receive either a booster dose of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), bivalent OPV (bOPV), or no vaccine. Using a micro-modified whole blood-based ELISPOT assay designed for field setting, circulating poliovirus type-specific IgA- and IgG-ASCs, including gut homing α4β7+ ASCs, were enumerated on days 0 and 7 after booster immunization. In addition, serum samples collected on days 0, 28 and 56 were tested for neutralizing antibody titers against poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3. Stool specimens were collected on day 28 (day of bOPV challenge), and on days 31, 35 and 42 and processed for poliovirus isolation.An IPV dose elicited blood IgA- and IgG-ASC responses in 84.8 to 94.9% of subjects, respectively. In comparison, a bOPV dose evoked corresponding blood ASC responses in 20.0 to 48.6% of subjects. A significant association was found between IgA- and IgG-ASC responses and serum neutralizing antibody titers for poliovirus type 1, 2, 3 (p<0.001). In the IPV group, α4β7+ ASCs accounted for a substantial proportion of IgA-ASCs and the proportion of subjects with a positive α4β7+ IgA-ASC response to poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 was 62.7%, 89.8% and 45.8%, respectively. A significant association was observed between virus excretion and α4β7+ IgA- and/or IgG-ASC responses to poliovirus type 3 among immunized children; however, only a weak association was found for type 1 poliovirus.Our results suggest that virus-specific blood ASCs, especially for type 3 poliovirus, can serve as surrogate of mucosal immunity after vaccination. Further studies are needed to evaluate the duration of such memory responses and to assess the programmatic utility of this whole blood-based mucosal ASC testing for the polio eradication program."
https://openalex.org/W2222729189,"Inappropriately activated mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is a risk factor for vascular remodeling with unclear molecular mechanism. Recent findings suggest that post-transcriptional regulation by micro-RNAs (miRs) may be involved. Our aim was to search for MR-dependent miRs in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and to explore the underlying molecular mechanism and the pathologic relevance. We detected that aldosterone via the MR reduces miR-29b in vivo in murine aorta and in human primary and cultured VSMCs (ED50 = 0.07 nM) but not in endothelial cells [quantitative PCR (qPCR), luciferase assays]. This effect was mediated by an increased decay of miR-29b in the cytoplasm with unchanged miR-29 family member or primary-miR levels. Decreased miR-29b led to an increase in extracellular matrix measured by ELISA and qPCR and enhanced VSMC migration in single cell-tracking experiments. Additionally, cell proliferation and the apoptosis/necrosis ratio (caspase/lactate dehydrogenase assay) was modulated by miR-29b. Enhanced VSMC migration by aldosterone required miR-29b regulation. Control experiments were performed with scrambled RNA and empty plasmids, by comparing aldosterone-stimulated with vehicle-incubated cells. Overall, our findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism of aldosterone-mediated vascular pathogenesis by identifying miR-29b as a pathophysiologic relevant target of activated MR in VSMCs and by highlighting the importance of miR processing for miR regulation.—Bretschneider, M., Busch, B., Mueller, D., Nolze, A., Schreier, B., Gekle, M., Grossmann, C.

https://openalex.org/W2225678843,"Lower maternal plasma volume expansion was found in idiopathic intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) but the link remains to be elucidated. An animal model of IUGR was developed by giving a low-sodium diet to rats over the last week of gestation. This treatment prevents full expansion of maternal circulating volume and the increase in uterine artery diameter, leading to reduced placental weight compared to normal gestation. We aimed to verify whether this is associated with reduced remodeling of uteroplacental circulation and placental hypoxia. Dams were divided into two groups: IUGR group and normal-fed controls. Blood velocity waveforms in the main uterine artery were obtained by Doppler sonography on days 14, 18 and 21 of pregnancy. On day 22 (term = 23 days), rats were sacrificed and placentas and uterine radial arteries were collected. Diameter and myogenic response of uterine arteries supplying placentas were determined while expression of hypoxia-modulated genes (HIF-1α, VEGFA and VEGFR2), apoptotic enzyme (Caspase -3 and -9) and glycogen cells clusters were measured in control and IUGR term-placentas. In the IUGR group, impaired blood velocity in the main uterine artery along with increased resistance index was observed without alteration in umbilical artery blood velocity. Radial uterine artery diameter was reduced while myogenic response was increased. IUGR placentas displayed increased expression of hypoxia markers without change in the caspases and increased glycogen cells in the junctional zone. The present data suggest that reduced placental and fetal growth in our IUGR model may be mediated, in part, through reduced maternal uteroplacental blood flow and increased placental hypoxia."

To date, a completely satisfactory corrective procedure has yet to be achieved. We hypothesize that a potential treatment option for this disease is to replace scarred vocal folds with organotypic mucosa. The purpose of this study is to regenerate vocal fold mucosa using a tissue-engineered structure with autologous oral mucosal cells.Animal experiment using eight beagles (including three controls).A 3 mm by 3 mm specimen of canine oral mucosa was surgically excised and divided into epithelial and subepithelial tissues. Epithelial cells and fibroblasts were isolated and cultured separately. The proliferated epithelial cells were co-cultured on oriented collagen gels containing the proliferated fibroblasts for an additional two weeks. The organotypic cultured tissues were transplanted to the mucosa-deficient vocal folds. Two months after transplantation, vocal fold vibrations and morphological characteristics were observed.A tissue-engineered vocal fold mucosa, consisting of stratified epithelium and lamina propria, was successfully fabricated to closely resemble the normal layered vocal fold mucosa. Laryngeal stroboscopy revealed regular but slightly small mucosal waves at the transplanted site. Immunohistochemically, stratified epithelium expressed cytokeratin, and the distributed cells in the lamina propria expressed vimentin. Elastic Van Gieson staining revealed a decreased number of elastic fibers in the lamina propria of the transplanted site.The fabricated mucosa with autologous oral mucosal cells successfully restored the vocal fold mucosa. This reconstruction technique could offer substantial clinical advantages for treating intractable diseases such as scarring of the vocal folds."
https://openalex.org/W2225135041,"Most studies that aim to understand the interactions between different types of photon radiation and cellular DNA assume homogeneous cell irradiation, with all cells receiving the same amount of energy. The level of DNA damage is therefore generally determined by averaging it over the entire population of exposed cells. However, evaluating the molecular consequences of a stochastic phenomenon such as energy deposition of ionizing radiation by measuring only an average effect may not be sufficient for understanding some aspects of the cellular response to this radiation. The variance among the cells associated with this average effect may also be important for the behaviour of irradiated tissue. In this study, we accurately estimated the distribution of the number of radiation-induced γH2AX foci (RIF) per cell nucleus in a large population of endothelial cells exposed to 3 macroscopic doses of gamma rays from 60Co. The number of RIF varied significantly and reproducibly from cell to cell, with its relative standard deviation ranging from 36% to 18% depending on the macroscopic dose delivered. Interestingly, this relative cell-to-cell variability increased as the dose decreased, contrary to the mean RIF count per cell. This result shows that the dose effect, in terms of the number of DNA lesions indicated by RIF is not as simple as a purely proportional relation in which relative SD is constant with dose. To analyse the origins of this observed variability, we calculated the spread of the specific energy distribution for the different target volumes and subvolumes in which RIF can be generated. Variances, standard deviations and relative standard deviations all changed similarly from dose to dose for biological and calculated microdosimetric values. This similarity is an important argument that supports the hypothesis of the conservation of the association between the number of RIF per nucleus and the specific energy per DNA molecule. This comparison allowed us to calculate a volume of 1.6 μm3 for which the spread of the specific energy distribution could explain the entire variability of RIF counts per cell in an exposed cell population. The definition of this volume may allow to use a microdosimetric quantity to predict heterogeneity in DNA damage. Moreover, this value is consistent with the order of magnitude of the volume occupied by the hydrated sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA molecule, which is the part of the DNA molecule responsible for strand breaks."
https://openalex.org/W2230396507,"The Ostracoda (Crustacea; Class Ostracoda) is a diverse, frequently abundant, and ecologically important component of the marine zooplankton assemblage. There are more than 200 described species of marine planktonic ostracods, many of which (especially conspecific species) can be identified only by microscopic examination and dissection of fragile morphological characters. Given the complexity of species identification and increasing lack of expert taxonomists, DNA barcodes (short DNA sequences for species discrimination and identification) are particularly useful and necessary. Results are reported from analysis of 210 specimens of 78 species of marine planktonic ostracods, including two novel species, and 51 species for which barcodes have not been previously published. Specimens were collected during 2006 to 2008 from the Atlantic, Indian, and Southern Oceans, Greenland Sea and Gulf of Alaska. Samples were collected from surface to 5,000 m using various collection devices. DNA sequence variation was analyzed for a 598 base-pair region of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. Kimura-2-Parameter (K2P) genetic distances within described species (mean = 0.010 ± 0.017 SD) were significantly smaller than between species (0.260 + 0.080), excluding eight taxa hypothesized to comprise cryptic species due to morphological variation (especially different size forms) and/or collection from different geographic regions. These taxa showed similar K2P distance values within (0.014 + 0.026) and between (0.221 ± 0.068) species. All K2P distances > 0.1 resulted from comparisons between identified or cryptic species, with no overlap between intra- and interspecific genetic distances. A Neighbor Joining tree resolved nearly all described species analyzed, with multiple sequences forming monophyletic clusters with high bootstrap values (typically 99%). Based on taxonomically and geographically extensive sampling and analysis (albeit with small sample sizes), the COI barcode region was shown to be a valuable character for discrimination, recognition, identification, and discovery of species of marine planktonic ostracods."
https://openalex.org/W2223614773,"Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), a tryptophan-catabolizing intracellular enzyme of the L-kynurenine pathway, causes preneoplastic cells and tumor cells to escape the immune system by inducing immune tolerance; this mechanism might be associated with the development and progression of human malignancies. In the present study, we investigated the role of IDO in diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced hepatocarcinogenesis by using IDO-knockout (KO) mice. To induce hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), hepatic adenoma, and preneoplastic hepatocellular lesions termed foci of cellular alteration (FCA), male IDO-wild-type (WT) and IDO-KO mice with a C57BL/6J background received a single intraperitoneal injection of DEN at 2 weeks of age. The mice were sacrificed to evaluate the development of FCA and hepatocellular neoplasms. HCC overexpressed IDO and L-kynurenine compared to surrounding normal tissue in the DEN-treated IDO-WT mice. The number and cell proliferative activity of FCAs, and the incidence and multiplicity of HCC were significantly greater in the IDO-WT than in the IDO-KO mice. The expression levels of the IDO protein, of L-kynurenine, and of IFN-γ, COX-2, TNF-α, and Foxp3 mRNA were also significantly increased in the DEN-induced hepatic tumors that developed in the IDO-WT mice. The mRNA expression levels of CD8, perforin and granzyme B were markedly increased in hepatic tumors developed in IDO-KO mice. Moreover, Foxp3-positive inflammatory cells had infiltrated into the livers of DEN-treated IDO-WT mice, whereas fewer cells had infiltrated into the livers of IDO-KO mice. Induction of IDO and elevation of L-kynurenine might play a critical role in both the early and late phase of liver carcinogenesis. Our findings suggest that inhibition of IDO might offer a promising strategy for the prevention of liver cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2233579919,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with an increase in serum retinol; however, the underlying mechanisms of this disorder are poorly characterized. Here, we found that the alteration of hepatic metabolism induced the accumulation of serum retinol in 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6Nx) mice. The liver is the major organ responsible for retinol metabolism; accordingly, microarray analysis revealed that the hepatic expression of most CYP genes was changed in 5/6Nx mice. In addition, D-box-binding protein (DBP), which controls the expression of several CYP genes, was significantly decreased in these mice. Cyp3a11 and Cyp26a1, encoding key proteins in retinol metabolism, showed the greatest decrease in expression in 5/6Nx mice, a process mediated by the decreased expression of DBP. Furthermore, an increase of plasma transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) in 5/6Nx mice led to the decreased expression of the Dbp gene. Consistent with these findings, the alterations of retinol metabolism and renal dysfunction in 5/6Nx mice were ameliorated by administration of an anti-TGF-β1 antibody. We also show that the accumulation of serum retinol induced renal apoptosis in 5/6Nx mice fed a normal diet, whereas renal dysfunction was reduced in mice fed a retinol-free diet. These findings indicate that constitutive Dbp expression plays an important role in mediating hepatic dysfunction under CKD. Thus, the aggravation of renal dysfunction in patients with CKD might be prevented by a recovery of hepatic function, potentially through therapies targeting DBP and retinol.

Impaired renal function inhibits the production of various metabolites in the body and aggravates renal fibrosis in CKD. The uremic toxins that accumulate during the early stages of CKD promote renal cell apoptosis via transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) (6Codreanu I. Perico N. Remuzzi G. Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system: the ultimate treatment for renal protection?.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: S34-S38Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Renal dysfunction in CKD is further promoted by signaling via the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (7Rüster C. Wolf G. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and progression of renal disease.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17: 2985-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Because inhibition of these signaling pathways is insufficient for renal protection, the development of novel therapies is needed for treating renal fibrosis and dysfunctions. Circadian rhythms have been observed in many biological systems and numerous physiological functions (8Vitaterna M.H. King D.P. Chang A.M. Kornhauser J.M. Lowrey P.L. McDonald J.D. Dove W.F.

In mammals, the master pacemaker controlling circadian rhythms is the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus. Recent molecular dissection of the circadian clock system has revealed that the core circadian oscillator consists of a transcription-translation feedback loop. CLOCK and BMAL1 form a heterodimer and activate transcription of the period (PER) and cryptochrome (CRY) genes. Once the PER and CRY proteins reach a critical concentration, they attenuate CLOCK/BMAL1 transactivation, thereby generating circadian oscillation through their own transcription (9Kume K. Zylka M.J.

Thus, the efficacies and toxicities of many drugs vary depending on dosing times associated with the 24-h rhythms of biochemical, physiological, and behavioral processes under the control of the circadian clock (14Ohdo S. Koyanagi S. Matsunaga N. Chronopharmacological strategies: intra- and inter-individual variability of molecular clock.Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2010; 62: 885-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recently, several clock genes have been found to control the circadian rhythms of cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes (14Ohdo S. Koyanagi S. Matsunaga N. Chronopharmacological strategies: intra- and inter-individual variability of molecular clock.Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2010; 62: 885-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We confirmed that expression of the CYP3A4 gene, encoding an important enzyme mediating xenobiotic metabolism in humans, exhibits a circadian rhythm in HepG2 cells (14Ohdo S. Koyanagi S. Matsunaga N. Chronopharmacological strategies: intra- and inter-individual variability of molecular clock.Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2010; 62: 885-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Disruption of these molecular clockworks has been linked to the onset of diseases such as cancer, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes in both humans and animal models (15Ohdo S. Koyanagi S. Matsunaga N.

Leblond F.A. Drug metabolism in chronic renal failure.Curr. Drug Metab. 2003; 4: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This is related, in part, to the fact that CKD affects not only the renal clearance of drugs but also the metabolism of xenobiotics and bioactive compounds by inhibiting key enzymatic systems within the liver. Indeed, several pharmacokinetics studies have demonstrated that the non-renal clearance of multiple drugs is reduced in patients with CKD (20Touchette M.A. Slaughter R.L. The effect of renal failure on hepatic drug clearance.DICP. 1991; 25: 1214-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 21Talbert R.L. Drug dosing in renal insufficiency.J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1994; 34: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition, the serum concentration of retinol, which in bioactive compounds is a fat-soluble vitamin A, is also elevated in patients with CKD (22Popper H. Steigmann F. Dyniewicz H.A.

Furthermore, almost all retinol is ingested via food and is metabolized primarily by the liver. Several CYPs are involved in retinol metabolism (25Ross A.C. Zolfaghari R.

However, the mechanisms and factors that decrease hepatic CYP gene expression under CKD remain to be elucidated. In this study, we aimed to identify the increase mechanisms of serum retinol and to provide evidence that the amelioration of hepatic dysfunction would be beneficial to reduce the symptoms of CKD. We utilized wild-type 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6Nx) CKD model mice to examine the expression and regulatory pathways of proteins involved in liver metabolism and their regulation by the local circadian clock. Four-week-old male ICR mice (Charles River Laboratories Japan, Inc., Yokohama, Japan) were housed in a light-controlled room (lights on from ZT0 to ZT12) at 24 ± 1 °C and 60 ± 10% humidity, with food and water available ad libitum. Mice were synchronized to the lighting conditions for 2 weeks before surgery. Male ICR mice (5 weeks old) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories Japan, Inc. This study was performed using Id2-knock-out mice of mixed genetic background (ICR) and wild-type ICR mice. We prepared mouse models of CKD by performing 5/6Nx operations in two stages under inhalation anesthesia (Baxter). In the first surgical procedure (at 7 weeks of age), two-thirds of the left kidney was removed by cutting off both poles. Seven days later, the right kidney was completely removed. After the second operation, mice were housed for 8 weeks (until they were 16 weeks old) in order to achieve CKD. Sham-operated mice were subjected to laparotomy on the same days as the procedure in the 5/6Nx mice. A mouse monoclonal anti-TGF-β1 antibody (1d11; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was reconstituted in PBS and administered to mice via intraperitoneal injection three times a week at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight. Treatment was initiated 6 weeks after the 5/6Nx operation and continued for 2 weeks. IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) was reconstituted in PBS and administered at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight as a control. All animals used in this study were treated in accordance with the guidelines stipulated by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Kyushu University. Hepatocytes were isolated from male mice using a collagenase perfusion method (32Uchida N. Kurata N. Shimada K. Nishimura Y. Yasuda K. Hashimoto M. Uchida E. Yasuhara H.

Pharmacol. 1995; 68: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in Williams' medium (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 5% FBS (SAFC Bioscience, Kansas City, MO), 0.1 μm insulin, 0.1 μm dexamethasone, and 2% penicillin/streptomycin and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified environment (5% CO2, 95% air). Following a 4-h attachment period, the culture medium was replaced with serum-free hepatocyte maintenance medium (Lonza, Walkersville, MD) containing 0.1 μm insulin, 0.1 μm dexamethasone, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 50 ng/ml amphotericin B. Serum samples were obtained from 5/6Nx mice. TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) was dissolved in DMSO. After preincubation, the medium was changed to DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 10% serum from 5/6Nx mice (0% FBS) or TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml; 10% FBS), and the mouse hepatocytes were grown for another 24 h. The mouse hepatocytes were exposed to 20 nm SD208 (R&D Systems; dissolved in DMSO) for 1 h before the 5/6Nx serum or TGF-β1 treatment began. Body weight was monitored at 8 weeks after operation using the Sartorius CPA22025 (Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany). Serum BUN levels were determined using a manufactured kit (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan). Kidneys were sliced into 10-μm sections using HM550-OMP (Thermo Scientific Microm). Sliced samples were labeled by TdT-mediated dUTP using an In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (TaKaRa, Otsu, Japan). Renal sections were observed by fluorescence microscopy. Apoptosis was determined using an Apo-One caspase-3/7 reagent kit (Promega). The mouse liver was collected at ZT6 in 8 weeks after the operation. Total RNA was isolated with RNAiso (TaKaRa). The quality of extracted RNA was analyzed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). The cRNA was amplified and labeled using a Low Input Quick Amp Labeling Kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Loveland, CO). Labeled cRNA was hybridized to a 44K Agilent 60-mer oligomicroarray (Whole Mouse Genome Microarray Kit version 2.0). To identify down-regulated or up-regulated genes, we calculated Z-scores and ratios (non-log-scaled -fold change) from the normalized signal intensities of each probe. We set criteria for down-regulated genes as follows: Z-score ≤ −2.0 and ratio ≤ 0.6. Functional analysis of the decreased gene expression was performed using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database on the DAVID system. Raw microarray data were submitted to Gene Expression Omnibus GEO in NCBI (accession numbers GSE35135 and GSE57799).

In addition, 0.5 ng/well phRL-TK vector (Promega, Tokyo, Japan) was co-transfected as an internal control reporter. At 24 h after transfection, cell extracts were prepared with passive lysis buffer (Promega), and the extracts were used for assays of firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase activity by luminometry. The ratio of firefly luciferase activity (expressed from reporter plasmids) to Renilla luciferase activity (expressed from phRL-TK) in each sample served as a measure of normalized luciferase activity. Serum retinol concentrations were measured by the Alliance HPLC system (Nihon Waters, Tokyo, Japan) (40Ali R. Campos B. Dyckhoff G. Haefeli W.E. Herold-Mende C. Burhenne J.

Serum was added to acetonitrile following acidification with 2 n acetic acid. After vortex mixing, water and an extraction mixture consisting of an n-hexane and 2-propanol (6.5:1.5, v/v) were added. The sample was extracted by vortex mixing for 2 min. After centrifugation (1000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), the organic layer was removed and evaporated in a solvent evaporator at 15 °C. The residue was dissolved in mobile phase solvent A by vortex mixing. Following centrifugation at 300 × g for 3 min, the supernatant was transferred into an autosampler vial and injected. The solvent system consisted of methanol-water (3:1, v/v) containing 10 mm ammonium acetate and 0.025% acetic acid (solvent A) and of methanol/dichloromethane (4:1, v/v) (solvent B). A linear gradient from 100% solvent A to 100% solvent B was applied over a period of 30 min, followed by isocratic elution with solvent B for an additional 15 min (Table 3). Between each run, the analytical column was equilibrated with 100% solvent A for 15 min (total run time 60 min). The flow rate was set at 0.4 ml/min, and the detection wavelength was set between 320 and 380 nm (from 18 to 40 min).

https://openalex.org/W1908792850,"This paper proposes a simple model to capture the complexity of multilayer systems where their constituent layers affect, and are affected by, each other. The physical layer is a circuit composed by a power source and resistors in parallel. Every individual agent aims at maximizing its own delivered power by adding, removing or keeping the resistors it has; the delivered power is in turn a non-linear function that depends on the other agents’ behavior, its own internal state, its global state perception, the information received from its neighbors via the communication network and a randomized selfishness. We develop an agent-based simulation to analyze the effects of number of agents (system size), communication network topology, communication errors and the minimum power gain that triggers a behavioral change on the system dynamic. Our results show that a wave-like behavior at macro-level (caused by individual changes in the decision layer) can only emerge for a specific system size. The ratio between cooperators and defectors depends on the minimum gain assumed—lower minimal gains lead to less cooperation, and vice-versa. Different communication network topologies imply different levels of power utilization and fairness at the physical layer, and a certain level of error in the communication layer induces more cooperation."

Abnormalities in FH are associated with the renal diseases atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and dense deposit disease and the ocular disease age-related macular degeneration. Although FH systemically controls complement activation, clinical phenotypes selectively manifest in kidneys and eyes, suggesting the presence of tissue-specific determinants of disease development. Recent results imply the importance of tissue-specifically expressed, sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), like HS, in determining FH binding to and activity on host tissues. Therefore, we investigated which GAGs mediate human FH and recombinant human FH complement control proteins domains 19 and 20 (FH19–20) binding to mouse glomerular endothelial cells (mGEnCs) in ELISA. Furthermore, we evaluated the functional defects of FH19–20 mutants during complement activation by measuring C3b deposition on mGEnCs using flow cytometry. FH and FH19–20 bound dose-dependently to mGEnCs and TNF-α treatment increased binding of both proteins, whereas heparinase digestion and competition with heparin/HS inhibited binding. Furthermore, 2-O-, and 6-O-, but not N-desulfation of heparin, significantly increased the inhibitory effect on FH19–20 binding to mGEnCs. Compared with wild type FH19–20, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome-associated mutants were less able to compete with FH in normal human serum during complement activation on mGEnCs, confirming their potential glomerular pathogenicity. In conclusion, our study shows that FH and FH19–20 binding to glomerular endothelial cells is differentially mediated by HS but not other GAGs.

HS are linear, negatively charged polysaccharides that can be extensively modified by sulfation and epimerization to yield highly heterogeneous structures (27Esko J.D. Selleck S.B.

Their observations are supported by earlier evidence from FH knock-out mouse models. FH-deficient mice display a phenotype reflecting human DDD, which is associated with systemic loss of complement control in the fluid phase (33Pickering M.C. Cook H.T. Warren J. Bygrave A.E. Moss J.

Recently, the model has been refined to a hepatocyte-specific FH knock-out, which results in a phenotype even closer to human C3 glomerulonephropathies that include DDD (34Vernon K.A. Ruseva M.M.

However, if mice instead express a FH construct lacking the five C-terminal CCPs, the resulting phenotype reflects aHUS, with glomerulospecific, complement-mediated damage despite normal plasma C3 concentrations (35Pickering M.C. de Jorge E.G.

The strong similarities between human and murine disease phenotypes led us to investigate the genotype-phenotype relation of FH19–20 mutants in the context of mouse glomerular endothelial cells. In a previous study we showed that aHUS-associated FH CCP19–20 (FH19–20) mutants exhibit impaired binding to C3b/C3d and impaired or enhanced binding to mouse glomerular endothelial cells (mGEnCs) and heparin (36Lehtinen M.J.

Our current study aimed to determine the functional effects of FH19–20 mutations and evaluate the role of GAGs in binding of FH to glomerular endothelium, the clinically affected tissue. We demonstrated that binding of FH to mGEnCs is partially mediated by HS, but not chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate or hyaluronan. Furthermore, several aHUS-associated FH19–20 mutants were less able to compete with full-length FH compared with wild type FH19–20 during alternative pathway activation on mGEnCs. The obtained results not only confirm the evaluated mutants' potential role in aHUS etiology but illustrate glomerular pathogenicity screening of FH mutants under highly controlled experimental conditions without requiring access to patient serum. Factor H (FH, Tyr-402 homozygous) was isolated from healthy donors as described (37Laine M. Jarva H. Seitsonen S. Haapasalo K. Lehtinen M.J. Lindeman N. Anderson D.H. Johnson P.T. Järvelä I.

GAG preparations included heparin, HS from bovine kidney, hyaluronic acid (Sigma), 2-O-desulfated heparin, 6-O-desulfated heparin, and N-desulfated heparin (Neoparin Inc., Alameda, CA). Conditionally immortalized mGEnCs with all features of primary glomerular endothelial cells were cultured as described (40Rops A.L. van der Vlag J. Jacobs C.W. Dijkman H.B. Lensen J.F.

Where indicated, cells were activated by incubation with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (10 ng/ml; Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) for 18 h. mGEnCs were grown in 96-well plates (Corning Life Sciences, Schiphol-Rijk, The Netherlands). The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with serial dilutions of FH and FH19–20 (0–80 μg/ml) in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin (2% PBA, w/v; Sigma) for 2 h at 37 °C. Binding was detected using polyclonal rabbit anti-human FH antiserum (a kind gift from Dr. J. Hellwage, Hans Knöll Institute, Jena, Germany). The cells were then washed twice with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS (PBS/Tween; v/v) and subsequently incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated F(ab′)2 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) in 2% PBA 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the cells were washed three times with PBS/Tween and incubated with tetramethylbenzidine substrate solution (Bio-Rad). The reaction was stopped after 15 min with an equal volume of 2 m H2SO4, and the absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a Bio-Rad Multiplate Reader (Bio-Rad). Full-length FH and wild type FH19–20 were used at their 50% effective concentrations (EC50) for the remaining binding assays. HS on TNF-α-activated mGEnCs was removed by treatment with 0.25 units/ml heparinase I, II, and III (Sigma) in 0.1 m sodium acetate, 0.2 mm calcium acetate (pH 7.0) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cell surface HS degradation was confirmed by measuring the expression of the HS epitope recognized by the antibody AO4B08 (41Kurup S. Wijnhoven T.J. Jenniskens G.J. Kimata K. Habuchi H. Li J.-P.

Chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate was removed by treating mGEnCs with 1 units/ml chondroitinase ABC (Sigma) in 25 mm Tris/HCl, 2 mm magnesium acetate (pH 8.0) for 1 h at 37 °C. The activity of chondroitinase ABC was checked with the anti-chondroitin sulfate antibody IO3H10 (42Smetsers T.F. van de Westerlo E.M. ten Dam G.B. Overes I.M.

Hyaluronic acid was removed by 0.1% hyaluronidase (w/v; from bovine testes, type I-S; Sigma) in 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 6.0) for 1 h at 37 °C, and its activity was confirmed using biotinylated hyaluronic acid-binding protein (Sigma). For the competition assays, FH/FH19–20 were preincubated with the different GAG preparations or the modified heparinoids (50 μg/ml) before being added to the cells. Binding of FH/FH19–20 was then determined using ELISA as described. TNF-α-activated mGEnCs were grown in 48-well plates (Corning Life Sciences). After washing twice with PBS, the cells were incubated with 20% pooled normal human serum (NHS; Complement Technology, Inc., Tyler, TX) in veronal-buffered saline (15 mm veronal, 145 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 0.025% NaN3 (pH 7.3)) at 37 °C. Twenty percent heat-inactivated NHS (30 min at 56 °C) in veronal-buffered saline was used as the negative control. Convertase formation was stopped after 60 min by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mm. The cells were then detached by vigorous pipetting, washed with 0.5% PBA, and incubated with rabbit anti-human C3/C3b (1 μg/ml; clone H-300; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) in 0.5% PBA for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing and incubating with a goat anti-rabbit IgG: Alexa488 (Life Technologies) for 30 min at 4 °C, C3b deposition on mGEnCs was detected using a Beckman Coulter FC500 flow cytometer and evaluated using CXP2.2 software. To evaluate the functional effects of aHUS-associated mutations, 10 μg/ml wild type or mutant FH19–20 were added to NHS to compete with full-length FH during the activation step. Titration data were fitted using non-linear regression with a “log(agonist) versus response” model using GraphPad Prism version 5.03 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Values are expressed as the means ± S.E., and significance was evaluated by Student's t test or analysis of variance using GraphPad Prism. Post hoc comparison of individual means was performed using Tukey's method. Binding experiments were performed four times in duplicate. Results of the activity assays represent data from three separate experiments. Complement FH binds endothelial cells (43Manuelian T. Hellwage J. Meri S. Caprioli J. Noris M. Heinen S. Jozsi M.

Invest. 2003; 111: 1181-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), and recently, we demonstrated the differential binding of FH19–20 and FH19–20 mutants to mGEnCs (36Lehtinen M.J. Rops A.L. Isenman D.E. van der Vlag J. Jokiranta T.S. Mutations of factor H impair regulation of surface-bound C3b by three mechanisms in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 15650-15658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the current study we investigated the ability of mGEnCs to bind FH and FH19–20 using ELISA and found that both FH and FH19–20 exhibited specific and dose-dependent binding to mGEnCs (Fig. 1a). Activation of mGEnCs with TNF-α to simulate the inflammatory conditions of aHUS significantly increased binding of both full-length FH and FH19–20 ∼1.5-fold and ∼1.3-fold, respectively (Fig. 1b). To take advantage of the observed increase in signal, we investigated binding of FH and FH19–20 using TNF-α-activated mGEnCs for the subsequent experiments. Because endothelial glycocalyx composition and modifications differ between different tissues, we investigated the role of different types of GAGs in regulating binding of FH and FH19–20 to glomerular endothelium. Therefore, mGEnCs were either treated with a mixture of glycosidases to degrade specific GAGs before measuring FH and FH19–20 binding, or the proteins were preincubated with soluble GAGs to compete for cell surface GAGs on mGEnCs. Although removal of chondroitin sulfate using chondroitinase ABC (CSase ABC) had no effect on binding of either full-length FH (Fig. 2a) or FH19–20 (Fig. 2b), digesting HS with heparinase I, II, and III (HepI-II-III) significantly reduced binding ∼1.7-fold and ∼1.2-fold, respectively. Treatment with hyaluronidase, which removes hyaluronic acid, decreased binding of FH19–20 to TNF-α-activated mGEnCs, whereas the binding of full-length FH was unaffected. However, binding of both proteins was significantly decreased after treating mGEnCs with both hyaluronidase and HepI-II-III, although not below the observed effect of HepI-II-III treatment alone. Accordingly, soluble hyaluronic acid did not effectively compete with mGEnC-associated hyaluronic acid for full-length FH and FH19–20 (Fig. 3). In contrast, preincubation with heparin or HS significantly inhibited the binding of full-length FH and FH19–20 to TNF-α-activated mGEnCs.FIGURE 3Competition with soluble heparin and HS reduces the binding of full-length FH and FH19–20 to mGEnCs. FH and FH19–20 were preincubated with 50 μg/ml hyaluronic acid, HS, heparin, or 2-O-, 6-O-, and N-desulfated (desulf.) heparin before adding the mixtures to monolayers of TNF-α-activated mGEnCs. The binding of full-length FH (a) and FH19–20 (b) to the cells was then evaluated by ELISA. Preincubation with heparin and HS significantly reduced binding of both proteins, whereas 2-O- and 6-O-desulfation selectively increased the inhibitory effect compared with heparin on FH19–20 but not FH binding to mGEnCs. The results were normalized on binding of full-length FH and FH19–20 to mGEnCs in the absence of competitors (Untreated). *, p < 0.05 versus untreated; **, p < 0.01 versus untreated; ***, p < 0.001 versus untreated; &, p < 0.05 versus heparin; &&, p < 0.01 versus heparin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because the interaction between HS and FH depends on the sulfation of the GAG backbone, we evaluated the effect of several selectively desulfated heparinoids in competition with HS in the glomerular endothelial glycocalyx. None of the modified heparinoids affected the binding of full-length FH when compared with heparin as the competitor (Fig. 3a). In contrast, preincubation with 2-O- and 6-O-desulfated heparin significantly reduced the binding of FH19–20 to mGEnCs compared with heparin (Fig. 3b), indicating that these modifications could be involved in the self-recognition of glomerular endothelium by FH19–20. N-Desulfated heparin in turn did not affect binding of FH19–20 to mGEnCs. Thus, 2-O- and 6-O-desulfated heparin showed differential inhibitory effects on the binding of full-length FH and FH19–20 to mGEnCs. Finally, GAG digestion appeared more effective in reducing full-length FH binding compared with FH19–20 (Fig. 2), whereas the opposite was observed during the competition experiments (Fig. 3).

Biomarkers prognosticating for the development of brain metastases in patients with non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) may improve personalized care. Six serum proteomic biomarkers were previously investigated at Memorial Sloan Kettering but their associations with brain metastases were unknown. Methods Serum NSE, CYFRA 21–1, ProGRP, SCC-Ag, TIMP1, and HE4 by ELISA-based proteomic assays were prospectively collected from consecutive patients with stage IV NSCLC. Pre-treatment serum biomarker levels as well as age, histology, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status were evaluated for association with the baseline presence of brain metastases using logistic regression and multivariable analysis. For patients without brain metastases at baseline, the cumulative incidence of subsequent brain metastases were compared according to baseline biomarkers and clinical factors using Gray’s test. Results A total of 118 patients were enrolled, 31 (26%; 95% CI 0.19–0.35) had brain metastases at baseline and a further 26 (22%; 95% CI 0.15–0.30) developed brain metastases subsequently. Pre-treatment serum biomarker levels were available in 104 patients. There was no significant association between the six serum biomarkers and the baseline presence or subsequent development of brain metastases. Age younger than 65 years was the only clinical factor significantly associated with brain metastasis at baseline (OR 3.00; 95% CI 1.22–7.34, P = 0.02) by multivariable analysis. A trend toward increased cumulative incidence of subsequent brain metastases was observed in patients with EGFR mutation (p = 0.2), but this was not statistically significant possibly due to small sample size. Conclusions Serum NSE, CYFRA 21–1, Pro-GRP, SCC-Ag, TIMP1, and HE4 are not significantly associated with brain metastases. Our methods taking into account follow-up time may be applied to independent datasets to identify a patient cohort with a higher biologic propensity for developing brain metastases. Such information may be useful for the study of agents targeting the development of brain metastases."

To investigate the variabilities and distributions of soil water and salt contents at various groundwater level (GL), soil columns with planting Tamarix chinensis Lour were established at six different GL. The results demonstrated the following: With increasing GL, the relative soil water content (RWC) declined significantly, whereas the salt content (SC) and absolute soil solution concentration (CS) decreased after the initial increase in the different soil profiles. A GL of 1.2 m was the turning point for variations in the soil water and salt contents, and it represented the highest GL that could maintain the soil surface moist within the soil columns. Both the SC and CS reached the maximum levels in these different soil profiles at a GL of 1.2 m. With the raise of soil depth, the RWC increased significantly, whereas the SC increased after an initial decrease. The mean SC values reached 0.96% in the top soil layer; however, the rates at which the CS and RWC decreased with the GL were significantly reduced. The RWC and SC presented the greatest variations at the medium (0.9-1.2 m) and shallow water levels (0.6 m) respectively, whereas the CS presented the greatest variation at the deep water level (1.5-1.8 m).The RWC, SC and CS in the soil columns were all closely related to the GL. However, the correlations among the parameters varied greatly within different soil profiles, and the most accurate predictions of the GL were derived from the RWC in the shallow soil layer or the SC in the top soil layer. A GL at 1.5-1.8 m was moderate for planting T. chinensis seedlings under saline groundwater conditions."

Periods of economic crisis are important social phenomena that are assumed to increase sickness absence due to mental disorders, although research on this topic remains scarce. The aim of this study was to gather data on long-term sickness absence (and relapse) due to mental disorders in Spain during a period of considerable socio-economic crisis.Relationships were analyzed (using chi-squared tests and multivariate modelling via binary logistic regression) between clinical, social/employment-related and demographic factors associated and long-term sickness absence (>60 consecutive days) due to mental disorders in a cohort of 7112 Spanish patients during the period 2008-2012.Older age, severe mental disorders, being self-employed, having a non-permanent contract, and working in the real estate and construction sector were associated with an increased probability of long-term sickness absence (gender had a mediating role with respect to some of these variables). Relapses were associated with short-term sick leave (return to work due to 'improvement') and with working in the transport sector and public administration.Aside from medical factors, other social/employment-related and demographic factors have a significant influence on the duration of sickness absence due to mental disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2231952962,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a global health threat. The search for novel anti-HCC agents is urgent. In the current study, we synthesized a liposomal C8 ceramide, and analyzed its anti-tumor activity in pre-clinical HCC models. The liposomal C8 (ceramide) potently inhibited HCC cell (HepG2, SMMC-7721 and Huh-7 lines) survival and proliferation, more efficiently than free C8 ceramide. Yet, non-cancerous HL7702 human hepatocytes were resistant to the liposomal C8 treatment. Liposomal C8 activated caspase-dependent apoptosis in HCC cells, and HCC cytotoxicity by liposomal C8 was significantly attenuated with co-treatment of caspase inhibitors. At the molecular level, we showed that liposomal C8 activated ASK1 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1)-JNK (Jun N-terminal protein kinase) signaling in HCC cells. On the other hand, JNK pharmacological inhibition or dominant negative mutation, as well as ASK1 shRNA-knockdown remarkably inhibited liposomal C8-induced apoptosis in HCC cells. Further studies showed that liposomal C8 inhibited AKT-mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) activation in HCC cells. Restoring AKT-mTOR activation by introducing a constitutively-active AKT alleviated HepG2 cytotoxicity by liposomal C8. In vivo, intravenous (i.v.) injection of liposomal C8 significantly inhibited HepG2 xenograft growth in severe combined immuno-deficient (SCID) mice, and mice survival was significantly improved. These preclinical results suggest that liposomal C8 could be further studied as a valuable anti-HCC agent."
https://openalex.org/W2229641887,"This study evaluated the working memory performance of 18 patients experiencing their first onset of mild depression without treatment and 18 healthy matched controls. The results demonstrated that working memory impairment in patients with mild depression occurred when memorizing the position of a picture but not when memorizing the pictures themselves. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the emotional impact on the working memory, indicating that the attenuation of spatial working memory was not affected by negative emotion; however, cognitive control selectively affected spatial working memory. In addition, the accuracy of spatial working memory in the depressed patients was not significantly reduced, but the reaction time was significantly extended compared with the healthy controls. This finding indicated that there was no damage to memory encoding and function maintenance in the patients but rather only impaired memory retrieval, suggesting that the extent of damage to the working memory system and cognitive control abilities was associated with the corresponding depressive symptoms. The development of mild to severe depressive symptoms may be accompanied by spatial working memory damage from the impaired memory retrieval function extending to memory encoding and memory retention impairments. In addition, the impaired cognitive control began with an inadequate capacity to automatically process internal negative emotions and further extended to impairment of the ability to regulate and suppress external emotions. The results of the mood-congruent study showed that the memory of patients with mild symptoms of depression was associated with a mood-congruent memory effect, demonstrating that mood-congruent memory was a typical feature of depression, regardless of the severity of depression. This study provided important information for understanding the development of cognitive dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2228752296,"A fundamental issue in the management and conservation of biodiversity is how to define a population. Spatially contiguous fish occupying a stream network have often been considered to represent a single, homogenous population. However, they may also represent multiple discrete populations, a single population with genetic isolation-by-distance, or a metapopulation. We used microsatellite DNA and a large-scale mark-recapture study to assess population structure in a spatially contiguous sample of Brook Trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), a species of conservation concern. We found evidence for limited genetic exchange across small spatial scales and in the absence of barriers to physical movement. Mark-recapture and stationary passive integrated transponder antenna records demonstrated that fish from two tributaries very seldom moved into the opposite tributary, but movements between the tributaries and mainstem were more common. Using Bayesian genetic clustering, we identified two genetic groups that exhibited significantly different growth rates over three years of study, yet survival rates were very similar. Our study highlights the importance of considering the possibility of multiple genetically distinct populations occurring within spatially contiguous habitats, and suggests the existence of a cryptic metapopulation: a spatially continuous distribution of organisms exhibiting metapopulation-like behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2222206255,"Autoantibodies against interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) can cause immunodeficiency and are associated with various opportunistic infections. In the present study, we investigated other cellular immune parameters for a better understanding of the immunodeficiency condition in the patients. The numbers of WBC, monocytes and NK cells were increased in patients with anti-IFN-γ autoantibodies (AAbs). Upon TCR activation, T cell proliferation and IL-2 receptor of the patients remained intact. Nonetheless, the Th1 cytokine (IFN-γ and TNF-α) production was up-regulated. The production of Th2 (IL-4) and Th17 (IL-17) cytokines was unchanged. We suggest that, in addition to the presence of anti-IFN-γ autoantibodies, alterations in the cellular immune functions may also contribute to this immunodeficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2224622385,"The identification of populations and spatial genetic patterns is important for ecological and conservation research, and spatially explicit individual-based methods have been recognised as powerful tools in this context. Mammalian carnivores are intrinsically vulnerable to habitat fragmentation but not much is known about the genetic consequences of fragmentation in common species. Stone martens (Martes foina) and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) share a widespread Palearctic distribution and are considered habitat generalists, but in the Iberian Peninsula stone martens tend to occur in higher quality habitats. We compared their genetic structure in Portugal to see if they are consistent with their differences in ecological plasticity, and also to illustrate an approach to explicitly delineate the spatial boundaries of consistently identified genetic units. We analysed microsatellite data using spatial Bayesian clustering methods (implemented in the software BAPS, GENELAND and TESS), a progressive partitioning approach and a multivariate technique (Spatial Principal Components Analysis-sPCA). Three consensus Bayesian clusters were identified for the stone marten. No consensus was achieved for the red fox, but one cluster was the most probable clustering solution. Progressive partitioning and sPCA suggested additional clusters in the stone marten but they were not consistent among methods and were geographically incoherent. The contrasting results between the two species are consistent with the literature reporting stricter ecological requirements of the stone marten in the Iberian Peninsula. The observed genetic structure in the stone marten may have been influenced by landscape features, particularly rivers, and fragmentation. We suggest that an approach based on a consensus clustering solution of multiple different algorithms may provide an objective and effective means to delineate potential boundaries of inferred subpopulations. sPCA and progressive partitioning offer further verification of possible population structure and may be useful for revealing cryptic spatial genetic patterns worth further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2226976717,"β-keto esters are used as precursors for the synthesis of β-amino acids, which are building blocks for some classes of pharmaceuticals. Here we describe the comparison of screening procedures for hydrolases to be used for the hydrolysis of β-keto esters, the first step in the preparation of β-amino acids. Two of the tested high throughput screening (HTS) assays depend on coupled enzymatic reactions which detect the alcohol released during ester hydrolysis by luminescence or absorption. The third assay detects the pH shift due to acid formation using an indicator dye. To choose the most efficient approach for screening, we assessed these assays with different statistical methods-namely, the classical Z'-factor, standardized mean difference (SSMD), the Kolmogorov-Smirnov-test, and t-statistics. This revealed that all three assays are suitable for HTS, the pH assay performing best. Based on our data we discuss the explanatory power of different statistical measures. Finally, we successfully employed the pH assay to identify a very fast hydrolase in an enzyme-substrate screening."
https://openalex.org/W2230914839,"Limited communication resources have gradually become a critical factor toward efficiency of decentralized large scale multi-agent coordination when both system scales up and tasks become more complex. In current researches, due to the agent's limited communication and observational capability, an agent in a decentralized setting can only choose a part of channels to access, but cannot perceive or share global information. Each agent's cooperative decision is based on the partial observation of the system state, and as such, uncertainty in the communication network is unavoidable. In this situation, it is a major challenge working out cooperative decision-making under uncertainty with only a partial observation of the environment. In this paper, we propose a decentralized approach that allows agents cooperatively search and independently choose channels. The key to our design is to build an up-to-date observation for each agent's view so that a local decision model is achievable in a large scale team coordination. We simplify the Dec-POMDP model problem, and each agent can jointly work out its communication policy in order to improve its local decision utilities for the choice of communication resources. Finally, we discuss an implicate resource competition game, and show that, there exists an approximate resources access tradeoff balance between agents. Based on this discovery, the tradeoff between real-time decision-making and the efficiency of cooperation using these channels can be well improved."

The complete genomes of two strains (V. mimicus 87, renamed as CAIM 1882, and V. mimicus 92, renamed as CAIM 1883) were sequenced. The sizes of the genomes were 3.9 Mb in both strains, with 2.8 Mb in ChI and 1.1 Mb in ChII. A 12.7% difference was found in the proteome content (BLAST matrix). Several virulence genes were detected (e.g. capsular polysaccharide, an accessory colonization factor and genes involved in quorum-sensing) which were classified in 16 categories. Variations in the gene content between these genomes were observed, mainly in proteins and virulence genes (e.g., hemagglutinin, mobile elements and membrane proteins). According to these results, both strains were different, even when they came from the same source, giving an insight of the diversity of V. mimicus. The identification of various virulence genes, including a not previously reported V. mimicus gene (acfD) in ChI in all sequenced strains, supports the pathogenic potential of this species. Further analysis will help to fully understand their potential virulence, environmental impact and evolution."

At least three ROMK isoforms have been identified in the kidney; however, unique functions of any of the isoforms in nephron segments are still poorly understood. We have generated a mouse deficient only in Romk1 by selective deletion of the Romk1-specific first exon using an ES cell Cre-LoxP strategy and examined the renal phenotypes, ion transporter expression, ROMK channel activity, and localization under normal and high K intake. Unlike Romk(-/-) mice, there was no Bartter phenotype with reduced NKCC2 activity and increased NCC expression in Romk1(-/-) mice. The small conductance K channel (SK) activity showed no difference of channel properties or gating in the collecting tubule between Romk1(+/+) and Romk1(-/-) mice. High K intake increased SK channel number per patch and increased the ROMK channel intensity in the apical membrane of the collecting tubule in Romk1(+/+), but such regulation by high K intake was diminished with significant hyperkalemia in Romk1(-/-) mice. We conclude that 1) animal knockouts of ROMK1 do not produce Bartter phenotype. 2) There is no functional linking of ROMK1 and NKCC2 in the TAL. 3) ROMK1 is critical in response to high K intake-stimulated K(+) secretion in the collecting tubule."
https://openalex.org/W2231973885,"The kidney displays specialized regions devoted to filtration, selective reabsorption, and electrolyte and metabolite trafficking. The polarized membrane pumps, channels, and transporters responsible for these functions have been exhaustively studied. Less examined are the contributions of spectrin and its adapter ankyrin to this exquisite functional topography, despite their established contributions in other tissues to cellular organization. We have examined in the rodent kidney the expression and distribution of all spectrins and ankyrins by qPCR, Western blotting, immunofluorescent and immuno electron microscopy. Four of the seven spectrins (αΙΙ, βΙ, βΙΙ, and βΙΙΙ) are expressed in the kidney, as are two of the three ankyrins (G and B). The levels and distribution of these proteins vary widely over the nephron. αΙΙ/βΙΙ is the most abundant spectrin, found in glomerular endothelial cells; on the basolateral membrane and cytoplasmic vesicles in proximal tubule cells and in the thick ascending loop of Henle; and less so in the distal nephron. βΙΙΙ spectrin largely replaces βΙΙ spectrin in podocytes, Bowman's capsule, and throughout the distal tubule and collecting ducts. βΙ spectrin is only marginally expressed; its low abundance hinders a reliable determination of its distribution. Ankyrin G is the most abundant ankyrin, found in capillary endothelial cells and all tubular segments. Ankyrin B populates Bowman's capsule, podocytes, the ascending thick loop of Henle, and the distal convoluted tubule. Comparison to the distribution of renal protein 4.1 isoforms and various membrane proteins indicates a complex relationship between the spectrin scaffold, its adapters, and various membrane proteins. While some proteins (e.g. ankyrin B, βΙΙΙ spectrin, and aquaporin 2) tend to share a similar distribution, there is no simple mapping of different spectrins or ankyrins to most membrane proteins. The implications of this data are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2236722183,"The available structural information on LeuT and structurally related transporters suggests that external loop 4 (eL4) and the outer end of transmembrane domain (TM) 10′ participate in the reversible occlusion of the outer pathway to the solute binding sites. Here, the functional significance of eL4 and the outer region of TM10′ are explored using the sodium/proline symporter PutP as a model. Glu-311 at the tip of eL4, and various amino acids around the outer end of TM10′ are identified as particularly crucial for function. Substitutions at these sites inhibit the transport cycle, and affect in part ligand binding. In addition, changes at selected sites induce a global structural alteration in the direction of an outward-open conformation. It is suggested that interactions between the tip of eL4 and the peptide backbone at the end of TM10′ participate in coordinating conformational alterations underlying the alternating access mechanism of transport. Together with the structural information on LeuT-like transporters, the results further specify the idea that common design and functional principles are maintained across different transport families."

The physiological functions of IαI are still mostly undefined; however, an involvement of IαI in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and stabilization and in inflammation has been recurring themes in the literature (9Zhuo L.

In the ECM, IαI interacts with a protein called tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene-6 protein (TSG-6) (10Rugg M.S. Willis A.C. Mukhopadhyay D. Hascall V.C. Fries E. Fülöp C. Milner C.M. Day A.J.

Patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis generate high amounts of the HC·HA complex in inflamed synovial fluid (19Yingsung W. Zhuo L. Morgelin M. Yoneda M. Kida D. Watanabe H.

Both bikunin- and TSG-6-deficient mice are unable to form a stable ECM around oocytes and ovulation consequently fails, thereby leading to infertility (21Zhuo L. Yoneda M. Zhao M. Yingsung W.

Other functions of IαI may relate to bikunin, which accounts for the protease inhibitory activity of IαI (9Zhuo L. Hascall V.C. Kimata K.

HC1 and HC2 contain a von Willebrand factor type A (vWA) domain in which one metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) motif is present (24Whittaker C.A. Hynes R.O. Distribution and evolution of von Willebrand/integrin A domains: widely dispersed domains with roles in cell adhesion and elsewhere.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3369-3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). However, the tertiary structures of the HCs have never been described in details, and to this date, the only IαI-related high-resolution structure available is the crystal structure of bikunin (25Xu Y. Carr P.D. Guss J.M. Ollis D.L. The crystal structure of bikunin from the inter-α-inhibitor complex: a serine protease inhibitor with two Kunitz domains.J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 955-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Additionally, the structure of the heterotrimeric IαI complex, including the CS, is not well described. An electron microscopy study has previously indicated that the overall structure of IαI is an extended and dumbbell-like shape (26Blom A.M. Mörgelin M. Oyen M. Jarvet J. Fries E. Structural characterization of inter-α-inhibitor: evidence for an extended shape.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 298-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In these electron microscopy-based analyses, the N-terminals of the HCs are observed as globular domains, with the C-terminals extending as flexible tails, and bikunin is observed as a small spherical structure (26Blom A.M. Mörgelin M. Oyen M. Jarvet J. Fries E. Structural characterization of inter-α-inhibitor: evidence for an extended shape.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 298-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to gain further insight into the structure and stability of IαI and investigate how the CS and divalent cations influenced both. We used a combination of biochemical and biophysical methods to show that IαI adopted a more compact conformation in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+, but not in the presence of Ca2+. This was evident by a faster migration during native electrophoresis, a decrease in the Stokes radius and an increase in the thermodynamic stability. Furthermore, cross-linking mass spectrometry revealed that the protein components of IαI interact directly and that these interactions depended on the presence of both the CS and/or Mg2+ or Mn2+ ions. It was further shown that the loose IαI structure was unable to form the HC·TSG-6 complex. Without the formation of the HC·TSG-6 complex, the ECM stabilizing HC·HA complex cannot be generated. The plasma concentration of Mg2+ is around 1 mm and it is thus likely that IαI in vivo is in the compact conformation. Conventional purification protocols results in slow IαI. Because this might not be the physiologically relevant conformation, it is important to consider this during the investigations of IαI biology and function.

The supernatant was made 16% in polyethylene glycol 8000, incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, and centrifuged to collect the precipitated protein that subsequently was dissolved in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.4 (buffer A1). The sample was applied to a 5-ml Hitrap Q HP (GE Healthcare) anion exchange column connected to an ÄKTA purifier HPLC system (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer A1. The column was eluted with a linear gradient of buffer B1 (buffer A1 containing 1 m NaCl) to 75% at 2% B/min with a flow rate of 3 ml/min. Fractions containing IαI according to SDS-PAGE were pooled and dialyzed into 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (Buffer A2). The sample was applied to a 5-ml Hitrap Blue HP (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in Buffer A2. The column was eluted using a linear gradient of buffer B2 (buffer A2 containing 2 m NaCl) to 90% at 0.5% B/min with a flow rate of 5 ml/min. Fractions containing IαI were pooled and dialyzed into 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (Buffer A3). The sample was applied to a 1-ml Hitrap Q HP (GE healthcare). The column was eluted with a linear gradient of buffer B3 (buffer A3 containing 1 m NaCl) to 75% at 2% B/min with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The purified protein was dialyzed into 20 mm Hepes, 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and frozen in aliquots. Purified IαI was treated with chondroitinase ABC (ChonABC) to partially or completely digest the CS chain. In the case of limited ChonABC digestion, IαI was incubated with 1 milliunit of ChonABC/10 μg of IαI in 20 mm Hepes, 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, at 37 °C for 2.5 h. In the case of extensive ChonABC digestion, IαI was incubated with 1 milliunit of ChonABC/0.15 μg of IαI at 37 °C for 18 h. Aliquots of the digests were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the digests were kept at −20 °C. IαI was titrated with BS3 at protein:cross-linker molar ratios of 1:50, 1:100, 1:500, 1:1000, 1:2500, and 1:5000. The titration was performed to find a low, but efficient cross-linker concentration. A ratio of 500 was used throughout the study. IαI was incubated with 1 mm BS3 in 20 mm Hepes, 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, for 30 min at 20 °C in the presence of 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, or 1 mm MnCl2, as indicated. IαI was incubated with EDTA or the specified cations for 30 min prior to cross-linking. BS3 solutions were prepared immediately before use to avoid hydrolysis. The reaction was quenched with 150 mm NH4HCO3 and left for 30 min. NaOH was added to 300 mm to dissociate the protein components and the samples were left on ice for 30 min (6Enghild J.J. Salvesen G.

The samples were separated by both SDS-PAGE and native-PAGE and visualized by either Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining or Western blotting. IαI was titrated with increasing amounts of sulfo-NHS-acetate at molar ratios from 1:65 to 1:2100 in 20 mm Hepes, 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, to block Lys residues. The samples were incubated for 60 min at 20 °C before the reaction was quenched with 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Sample buffer for native-PAGE was added after 30 min and the samples were analyzed by native-PAGE. IαI and ChonABC-treated IαI were applied to a Superdex 200 increase 10/300 GL column (GE healthcare) equilibrated in 20 mm Hepes, 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, or 1 mm MnCl2. The column was calibrated with a size exclusion chromatography markers kit (Sigma) containing carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa and Rs 2.01 nm,), albumin (66 kDa and Rs 3.6 nm), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa and Rs 4.6 nm), β-amylase (200 kDa and Rs 4.8 nm), apoferritin (443 kDa and Rs 6.1 nm), and thyroglobulin (669 kDa and Rs 8.5 nm). Blue dextran was used to obtain V0 (2000 kDa). The Stokes' radius of IαI and the protein components were calculated using the linear relationship between Ve/V0 and Stokes radius in a semi-logarithmic plot. Elution position of protein standards (repeated for each buffer condition) were used to generate a standard curve of Stokes radius versus (−log Kav)1/2 that was used to calculate the Stokes radii of the IαI species (31Laurent T.C. Killander J. Theory of gel filtration and its experimental verification.J. Chromatogr. A. 1964; 14: 317-330Crossref Google Scholar). IαI and ChonABC-treated IαI were diluted to a protein concentration of 0.2 mg/ml using 20 mm Hepes, 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, with 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, or 1 mm MnCl2 and stored at 5 °C. Circular dichroism (CD) was performed on a J-810 CD-spectrometer (Jasco) using a 1-mm quartz cuvette with lid (Hellma Analytics). Thermo scans were performed from 20 to 95 °C at a wavelength of 222 nm with a step size of 0.2 °C, bandwidth of 8 nm, response time of 8 s, and scan speed of 60 °C/h. The thermal scan data were fitted, as described previously, using the software KaleidaGraph (version 4.0 Synergy Software) (32Mogensen J.E. Ipsen H. Holm J. Otzen D.E. Elimination of a misfolded folding intermediate by a single point mutation.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3357-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The fitted parameters were used to calculate the fraction of folded protein at different temperatures. All samples were analyzed in triplicates. IαI with 1 mm MgCl2, IαI with 5 mm EDTA, or ChonABC-treated IαI with 1 mm MgCl2 were titrated with increasing amounts of sulfo-NHS-acetate at molar ratios from 0 to 1:1000 in 20 mm Hepes, 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. The reaction was quenched after 1 h by addition of 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. The sample was denatured and reduced in 6 m urea containing 5 mm DTT for 1 h, alkylated with 15 mm iodoacetamide for 1 h, and diluted to 0.8 m urea with 50 mm NH4HCO3. Samples were treated with either trypsin alone or endoproteinase GluC and subsequently trypsin. The proteases were added at a (w/w) ratio of 1:20 and the sample was incubated for 18 h at 37 °C. The sample was desalted using self-packed reverse phase microcolumns containing POROS R2 (33Kussmann M. Lässing U. Stürmer C.A. Przybylski M. Roepstorff P.

Following quenching of the cross-linking reaction, the sample was concentrated using a 30-kDa cutoff centrifugal filter (Amicon Ultra) and the buffer was exchanged to 20 mm Hepes, 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, to remove the cross-linker. The sample was reduced, alkylated, treated with trypsin, and desalted as described above. The desalted peptides were dissolved in 10 mm KH2PO4, 20% acetonitrile, pH 2.8 (Buffer A), and applied to a PolySULFOETHYL A column (PolyLC) equilibrated in buffer A. The peptides were eluted using a flow rate at 0.15 ml/min and a gradient of 0–60% buffer B (1 m KCl in buffer A) over 30 min and 60% Buffer B for 10 min. The tryptic peptides were collected and micro-purified using self-pack microcolumns containing POROS R2 and subsequently lyophilized. Samples enriched for cross-linked peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry in 3 replicate runs. Nano LC-MS/MS was performed using an EASY-nLC II system (Thermo Scientific) connected to a TripleTOF 5600+ mass spectrometer (AB Sciex) equipped with a NanoSpray III source (AB Sciex) operated under Analyst TF 1.5.1 control. Peptides were dissolved in 0.1% formic acid, injected, trapped, and desalted on a ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ trap column (2 cm × 100-μm inner diameter packed in-house with 3 μm resin;"
https://openalex.org/W2229390668,"Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is a model organism for understanding aging and studying animal behavior. Microfluidic assay techniques have brought widespread advances in C. elegans research; however, traditional microfluidic assays such as those based on soft lithography require time-consuming design and fabrication cycles and offer limited flexibility in changing the geometric environment during experimentation. We present a technique for maskless photopatterning of a biocompatible hydrogel on an NGM (Agar) substrate, enabling dynamic manipulation of the C. elegans culture environment in vitro. Maskless photopatterning is performed using a projector-based microscope system largely built from off-the-shelf components. We demonstrate the capabilities of this technique by building micropillar arrays during C. elegans observation, by fabricating free-floating mechanisms that can be actuated by C. elegans motion, by using freehand drawing to isolate individual C. elegans in real time, and by patterning arrays of mazes for isolation and fitness testing of C. elegans populations. In vitro photopatterning enables rapid and flexible design of experiment geometry as well as real-time interaction between the researcher and the assay such as by sequential isolation of individual organisms. Future adoption of image analysis and machine learning techniques could be used to acquire large datasets and automatically adapt the assay geometry."
https://openalex.org/W2223123867,"The asymptotic variance and distribution of Spearman's rank correlation have previously been known only under independence. For variables with finite support, the population version of Spearman's rank correlation has been derived. Using this result, we show convergence to a normal distribution irrespectively of dependence, and derive the asymptotic variance. A small simulation study indicates that the asymptotic properties are of practical importance."
https://openalex.org/W2224799750,"Academic achievement in adolescents is correlated with 1-carbon metabolism (1-CM), as folate intake is positively related and total plasma homocysteine (tHcy) negatively related to academic success. Because another 1-CM nutrient, choline is essential for fetal neurocognitive development, we hypothesized that choline and betaine could also be positively related to academic achievement in adolescents. In a sample of 15-yr-old children (n= 324), we measured plasma concentrations of homocysteine, choline, and betaine and genotyped them for 2 polymorphisms with effects on 1-CM, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C>T, rs1801133, and phosphatidylethanolamineN-methyltransferase (PEMT), rs12325817 (G>C). The sum of school grades in 17 major subjects was used as an outcome measure for academic achievement. Lifestyle and family socioeconomic status (SES) data were obtained from questionnaires. Plasma choline was significantly and positively associated with academic achievement independent of SES factors (paternal education and income, maternal education and income, smoking, school) and of folate intake (P= 0.009,R(2)= 0.285). With the addition of thePEMTrs12325817 polymorphism, the association value was only marginally changed. Plasma betaine concentration, tHcy, and theMTHFR677C>T polymorphism did not affect academic achievement in any tested model involving choline. Dietary intake of choline is marginal in many adolescents and may be a public health concern.-Nilsson, T. K., Hurtig-Wennlöf, A., Sjöström, M., Herrmann, W., Obeid, R., Owen, J. R., Zeisel, S.

https://openalex.org/W2235011276,"The DnaB-DnaC complex binds to the unwound DNA within the Escherichia coli replication origin in the helicase loading process, but the biochemical events that lead to its stable binding are uncertain. This study characterizes the function of specific C-terminal residues of DnaC. Genetic and biochemical characterization of proteins bearing F231S and W233L substitutions of DnaC reveals that their activity is thermolabile. Because the mutants remain able to form a complex with DnaB at 30 and 37 °C, their thermolability is not explained by an impaired interaction with DnaB. Photo-cross-linking experiments and biosensor analysis show an altered affinity of these mutants compared with wild type DnaC for single-stranded DNA, suggesting that the substitutions affect DNA binding. Despite this difference, their activity in DNA binding is not thermolabile. The substitutions also drastically reduce the affinity of DnaC for ATP as measured by the binding of a fluorescent ATP analogue (MANT-ATP) and by UV cross-linking of radiolabeled ATP. Experiments show that an elevated temperature substantially inhibits both mutants in their ability to load the DnaB-DnaC complex at a DnaA box. Because a decreased ATP concentration exacerbates their thermolabile behavior, we suggest that the F231S and W233L substitutions are thermolabile in ATP binding, which correlates with defective helicase loading at an elevated temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2229638571,"Purpose To create a standardized method for evaluating the video recordings of patients self-instilling eye drops and to determine the level of agreement of eye drop instillation efficacy, safety and efficiency ratings by three masked graders. Design Prospective cross-sectional study. Participants 78 patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension who had at least 6 months of experience with the use of eye drop medications. Methods Participants were video recorded while self-instilling artificial tears sequentially to both eyes. Three masked observers graded these video recordings on three criteria: efficacy (the determination of whether an eye drop was instilled on the ocular surface), safety (assessment of whether the tip of the medication bottle made contact with the ocular surface or eyelids), and efficiency (the number of eye drops expressed from the bottle). Main Outcome Measures After grading the video recordings based on efficacy, safety, and efficiency, kappa statistics were used to estimate inter-rater agreement. Results The mean kappa level of agreement for efficacy, safety, and efficiency was 0.64 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.42–0.87), 0.73 (95% CI, 0.58–0.88), and 0.62 (95% CI, 0.42–0.81), respectively. Conclusions We demonstrated good inter-rater reproducibility of the masked analysis of video recordings of patients self-instilling eye drops based on three criteria: efficiency, safety, and efficacy."
