https://openalex.org/W2990870977,"Accurate identification of tumor-derived somatic variants in plasma circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) requires understanding of the various biological compartments contributing to the cfDNA pool. We sought to define the technical feasibility of a high-intensity sequencing assay of cfDNA and matched white blood cell DNA covering a large genomic region (508 genes; 2 megabases; >60,000× raw depth) in a prospective study of 124 patients with metastatic cancer, with contemporaneous matched tumor tissue biopsies, and 47 controls without cancer. The assay displayed high sensitivity and specificity, allowing for de novo detection of tumor-derived mutations and inference of tumor mutational burden, microsatellite instability, mutational signatures and sources of somatic mutations identified in cfDNA. The vast majority of cfDNA mutations (81.6% in controls and 53.2% in patients with cancer) had features consistent with clonal hematopoiesis. This cfDNA sequencing approach revealed that clonal hematopoiesis constitutes a pervasive biological phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of matched cfDNA-white blood cell sequencing for accurate variant interpretation."
https://openalex.org/W2991212521,"The genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been widely used as an experimental design to detect associations between genetic variants and a phenotype. Two major confounding factors, population stratification and relatedness, could potentially lead to inflated GWAS test statistics and hence to spurious associations. Mixed linear model (MLM)-based approaches can be used to account for sample structure. However, genome-wide association (GWA) analyses in biobank samples such as the UK Biobank (UKB) often exceed the capability of most existing MLM-based tools especially if the number of traits is large. Here, we develop an MLM-based tool (fastGWA) that controls for population stratification by principal components and for relatedness by a sparse genetic relationship matrix for GWA analyses of biobank-scale data. We demonstrate by extensive simulations that fastGWA is reliable, robust and highly resource-efficient. We then apply fastGWA to 2,173 traits on array-genotyped and imputed samples from 456,422 individuals and to 2,048 traits on whole-exome-sequenced samples from 46,191 individuals in the UKB. fastGWA is a mixed linear model–based approach for performing genome-wide association analyses at biobank scale, while controlling for population stratification and relatedness."
https://openalex.org/W2990909677,"Childhood brain tumors have suspected prenatal origins. To identify vulnerable developmental states, we generated a single-cell transcriptome atlas of >65,000 cells from embryonal pons and forebrain, two major tumor locations. We derived signatures for 191 distinct cell populations and defined the regional cellular diversity and differentiation dynamics. Projection of bulk tumor transcriptomes onto this dataset shows that WNT medulloblastomas match the rhombic lip-derived mossy fiber neuronal lineage and embryonal tumors with multilayered rosettes fully recapitulate a neuronal lineage, while group 2a/b atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors may originate outside the neuroectoderm. Importantly, single-cell tumor profiles reveal highly defined cell hierarchies that mirror transcriptional programs of the corresponding normal lineages. Our findings identify impaired differentiation of specific neural progenitors as a common mechanism underlying these pediatric cancers and provide a rational framework for future modeling and therapeutic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2989688132,"Histiocytoses are clonal hematopoietic disorders frequently driven by mutations mapping to the BRAF and MEK1 and MEK2 kinases. Currently, however, the developmental origins of histiocytoses in patients are not well understood, and clinically meaningful therapeutic targets outside of BRAF and MEK are undefined. In this study, we uncovered activating mutations in CSF1R and rearrangements in RET and ALK that conferred dramatic responses to selective inhibition of RET (selpercatinib) and crizotinib, respectively, in patients with histiocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2989956209,"Somatic mutations can result in the formation of neoantigens, immunogenic peptides that are presented on the tumor cell surface by HLA molecules. These mutations are expected to be under negative selection pressure, but the extent of the resulting neoantigen depletion remains unclear. On the basis of HLA affinity predictions, we annotated the human genome for its translatability to HLA binding peptides and screened for reduced single nucleotide substitution rates in large genomic data sets from untreated cancers. Apparent neoantigen depletion signals become negligible when taking into consideration trinucleotide-based mutational signatures, owing to lack of power or to efficient immune evasion mechanisms that are active early during tumor evolution. Pan-cancer genomic analyses based on HLA affinity predictions show that apparent neoantigen depletion signals in untreated tumors become negligible after correction for trinucleotide-based mutational signatures."
https://openalex.org/W2991242412,"Background The addiction crisis is widespread, and unsafe injection practices among people who inject drugs (PWID) can lead to infective endocarditis. Methods A retrospective analysis of adult patients with definite or possible infective endocarditis admitted to a tertiary care center in Portland, Maine was performed over three-year period. Our primary objective was to examine differences in demographics, health characteristics, and health service utilization between injection drug use (IDU)-associated infective endocarditis and non-IDU infective endocarditis. The association between IDU and mortality, morbidity (defined as emergency department visits within 3 months of discharge), and cardiac surgery was examined. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed. A subgroup descriptive analysis of PWID was also performed to better examine substance use disorder (SUD) characteristics, treatment with medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and health service utilization. Results One-hundred and seven patients were included in the study, of which 39.2% (n = 42) had IDU-associated infective endocarditis. PWID were more likely to be homeless, uninsured, and lack a primary care provider. PWID were notably younger and had less documented comorbidities, however had similar in-hospital mortality rates (10% vs. 14%, p = 0.30), ED visits (50% vs. 54%, p = 0.70) and cardiac surgery (33% vs. 26%, p = 0.42) compared to those with non-IDU infective endocarditis. Ninety-day mortality was less among PWID (19.0% vs. 36.9%, p = 0.05). IDU was not associated with morbidity (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.73, 95% CI 0.18–3.36), 90-day mortality (AOR 0.72, 95% CI 0.17–3.01), or cardiac surgery (AOR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03–0.69). Ninety-day mortality among PWID who received MOUD was lower (3% vs 15%, p = 0.45), as were ED visits (10% vs. 41%, p = 0.42) compared to those who did not receive MOUD. Conclusions Our results highlight existing differences in health characteristics and social determinants of health in people with IDU-associated versus non-IDU infective endocarditis. PWID had less comorbidities and were significantly younger than those with non-IDU infective endocarditis and yet still had similar rates of cardiac surgery, ED visits, and in-hospital mortality. These findings emphasize the need to deliver comprehensive health services, particularly MOUD and other harm reduction services, to this marginalized population."
https://openalex.org/W2989680258,"Nosocomial infections have become a serious threat in our times and are getting more difficult to handle due to increasing development of resistances in bacteria. In this light, cold atmospheric plasma (CAP), which is known to effectively inactivate microorganisms, may be a promising alternative for application in the fields of dentistry and dermatology. CAPs are partly ionised gases, which operate at low temperature and are composed of electrons, ions, excited atoms and molecules, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. In this study, the effect of CAP generated from ambient air was investigated against Enterococcus faecalis, grown on agar plates or as biofilms cultured for up to 72 h. CAP reduced the colony forming units (CFU) on agar plates by > 7 log10 steps. Treatment of 24 h old biofilms of E. faecalis resulted in CFU-reductions by ≥ 3 log10 steps after CAP treatment for 5 min and by ≥ 5 log10 steps after CAP treatment for 10 min. In biofilm experiments, chlorhexidine (CHX) and UVC radiation served as positive controls and were only slightly more effective than CAP. There was no damage of cytoplasmic membranes upon CAP treatment as shown by spectrometric measurements for release of nucleic acids. Thus, membrane damage seems not to be the primary mechanism of action for CAP towards E. faecalis. Overall, CAP showed pronounced antimicrobial efficacy against E. faecalis on agar plates as well as in biofilms similar to positive controls CHX or UVC."

https://openalex.org/W2989957010,"Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that regulates cell-cell interactions through binding of Notch family receptors to their cognate ligands. Notch signaling has an essential role in vascular development and angiogenesis. Recent studies have reported that Notch may be implicated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathophysiology. We measured the levels of soluble Notch1 (sNotch1) in the plasma samples from 72 dementia patients (average age 75.1 y), 89 subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (average age 73.72 y), and 150 cognitively normal controls (average age 72.34 y). Plasma levels of sNotch1 were 25.27% lower in dementia patients as compared to healthy control subjects. However, the level of Notch1 protein was significantly increased in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) after amyloid-beta treatment. Also, Notch1 mRNA level was significantly increased in HBMECs and iPSC-derived neuronal cells from AD patient compared to normal control. These results indicate that altered expression of Notch1 might be associated with the risk of Alzheimer’s disease."
https://openalex.org/W2990116260,"To increase intramuscular fat accumulation, Japanese Black cattle are commonly fed a high-grain diet from 10 to 30 months of age although it can result in the abnormal accumulation of organic acids in the rumen. We explored the effect of long-term high-concentrate diet feeding on ruminal pH and fermentation, and its effect on the rumen bacterial community in Japanese Black beef cattle during a 20-month fattening period. Nine castrated and fistulated Japanese Black beef cattle were housed with free access to food and water throughout the study period (10–30 months of age). The fattening stages included Early, Middle, and Late stages (10–14, 15–22, and 23–30 months of age, respectively). Cattle were fed high-concentrate diets for the experimental cattle during fattening. The body weight of the cattle was 439 ± 7.6, 561 ± 11.6, and 712 ± 18.5 kg (mean ± SE) during the Early, Middle, and Late stages, respectively. Ruminal pH was measured continuously during the final 7 days of each stage, and rumen fluid and blood samples were collected on day 4 (fourth day during the final 7 days of the pH measurements). The 24-h mean ruminal pH during the Late stage was significantly lower than that during the Early stage. Total volatile fatty acid (VFA) during the Late stage was significantly lower than during the Early and Middle stages, but no changes were noted in individual VFA components. The lactic acid concentration during the Late stage was significantly higher than that during the Early and Middle stages. The bacterial richness indices decreased significantly during the Late stage in accordance with the 24-h mean ruminal pH. Among the 35 bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) shared by all samples, the relative abundances of OTU8 (Family Ruminococcaceae) and OTU26 (Genus Butyrivibrio) were positively correlated with the 24-h mean ruminal pH. Total VFA concentration was negatively correlated with OTU167 (Genus Intestinimonas), and lactic acid concentration was correlated positively with OTU167 and OTU238 (Family Lachnospiraceae). These results suggested that long-term high-grain diet feeding gradually lowers ruminal pH and total VFA production during the Late fattening stage. However, the ruminal bacterial community adapted to feeding management and the lower pH during the Late stage by preserving their diversity or altering their richness, composition, and function, to enhance lactic acid production in Japanese Black beef cattle."
https://openalex.org/W2990700974,"Non-publication and publication bias in animal research is a core topic in current debates on the ""reproducibility crisis"" and ""failure rates in clinical research"". To date, however, we lack reliable evidence on the extent of non-publication in animal research. We collected a random and stratified sample (n = 210) from all archived animal study protocols of two major German UMCs (university medical centres) and tracked their results publication. The overall publication rate was 67%. Excluding doctoral theses as results publications, the publication rate decreased to 58%. We did not find substantial differences in publication rates with regard to i) the year of animal study approval, ii) the two UMCs, iii) the animal type (rodents vs. non-rodents), iv) the scope of research (basic vs. preclinical), or v) the discipline of the applicant. Via the most reliable assessment strategy currently available, our study confirms that the non-publication of results from animal studies conducted at UMCs is relatively common. The non-publication of 33% of all animal studies is problematic for the following reasons: A) the primary legitimation of animal research, which is the intended knowledge gain for the wider scientific community, B) the waste of public resources, C) the unnecessary repetition of animal studies, and D) incomplete and potentially biased preclinical evidence for decision making on launching early human trials. Results dissemination should become a professional standard for animal research. Academic institutions and research funders should develop effective policies in this regard."
https://openalex.org/W2990752279,"High levels of suspended particulate matters (PMs) and bioaerosols are created by dental procedures. The present study aimed to evaluate the size and concentration of PMs produced by drilling and grinding teeth, and to assess the efficiency of central vacuum system and protective masks for the removal of PMs.A total of 20 extracted permanent teeth were collected. A novel experimental system and particle counter were used to evaluate the PMs produced by dental procedures and the PM removal efficiency of a central vacuum system and surgical/N95 masks.The number concentration of total PMs produced by drilling and grinding teeth was significantly higher than the indoor background concentration. The average aerodynamic diameter of particle was generally less than 1 μm. The average number concentration of ultrafine particles was 2.1x1011 particles/m3 during tooth drilling and grinding. The efficiency of the central vacuum system was 35.74% for PM≥0.5 and 35.41% for PM10. For PM≥0.5, the ratios of inside and outside masks were 0.8-1.34 without vacuum and 1.18-1.36 with vacuum. No difference was found with the use of surgical/N95 masks during dental therapy, with or without vacuum use.High levels of PMs were found during tooth drilling and grinding procedures, especially among PM1. The PM removal efficiency of a central vacuum system and surgical/N95 masks were limited."
https://openalex.org/W2989935374,"Objective To investigate age-associated changes in airway microbiome composition and their relationships with lung function and arterial stiffness among genetically matched young and elderly pairs. Methods Twenty-four genetically linked family pairs comprised of younger (≤40 years) and older (≥60 years) healthy participants were recruited (Total n = 48). Lung function and arterial stiffness (carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AIx)) were assessed. Sputum samples were collected for targeted 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and correlations between microbiome composition, lung function and arterial stiffness were investigated. Results Elderly participants exhibited reductions in lung function (FEV1 (p<0.001), FVC (p<0.001) and percentage FEV1/FVC (p = 0.003)) and a 1.3–3.9-fold increase in arterial stiffness (p<0.001) relative to genetically related younger adults. Elderly adults had a higher relative abundance of Firmicutes (p = 0.035) and lower relative abundance of Proteobacteria (p = 0.014), including specific genera Haemophilus (p = 0.024) and Lautropia (p = 0.020) which were enriched in the younger adults. Alpha diversity was comparable between young and elderly pairs (p>0.05) but was inversely associated with lung function (FEV1%Predicted and FVC %Predicted) in the young (p = 0.006 and p = 0.003) though not the elderly (p = 0.481 and p = 0.696). Conversely, alpha diversity was negatively associated with PWV in the elderly (p = 0.01) but not the young (p = 0.569). Specifically, phylum Firmicutes including the genus Gemella were correlated with lung function (FVC %Predicted) in the young group (p = 0.047 and p = 0.040), while Fusobacteria and Leptotrichia were associated with arterial stiffness (PWV) in the elderly (both p = 0.004). Conclusion Ageing is associated with increased Firmicutes and decreased Proteobacteria representation in the airway microbiome among a healthy Asian cohort. The diversity and composition of the airway microbiome is independently associated with lung function and arterial stiffness in the young and elderly groups respectively. This suggests differential microbial associations with these phenotypes at specific stages of life with potential prognostic implications."
https://openalex.org/W2990027720,"Disconnected urban street networks, which we call “street-network sprawl,” are strongly associated with increased vehicle travel, energy use and CO2 emissions, as shown by previous research in Europe and North America. In this paper, we provide the first systematic and globally commensurable measures of street-network sprawl based on graph-theoretic and geographic concepts. Using data on all 46 million km of mapped streets worldwide, we compute these measures for the entire Earth at the highest possible resolution. We generate a summary scalar measure for street-network sprawl, the Street-Network Disconnectedness index (SNDi), as well as a data-driven multidimensional classification that identifies eight empirical street-network types that span the spectrum of connectivity, from gridiron to dendritic (tree-like) and circuitous networks. Our qualitative validation shows that both the scalar and multidimensional measures are meaningfully comparable within and across countries, and successfully capture varied dimensions of walkability and urban development. We further show that in select high-income countries, our measures explain cross-sectional variation in household transportation decisions, and a one standard-deviation increase in SNDi is associated with an extra 0.25 standard deviations in cars owned per household. We aggregate our measures to the scale of countries, cities, and smaller geographies and describe patterns in street-network sprawl around the world. Latin America, Japan, South Korea, much of Europe, and North Africa stand out for their low levels of street-network sprawl, while the highest levels are found in south-east Asia, the United States, and the British Isles. Our calculations provide the foundation for future work to understand urban processes, predict future pathways of transportation energy consumption and emissions, and identify effective policy responses."
https://openalex.org/W2990618242,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a serious public health problem and a global concern. The inappropriate use of antibiotics has been identified by the World Health Organization as a major risk factor for AMR.The purpose of this research study is to assess the prevalence of inappropriate antibiotic use among Qatar University students and their family members, detect sociodemographic factors associated with inappropriate use, evaluate the knowledge and attitude towards antibiotic use, and assess respondents' opinions on healthcare providers' antibiotic prescription practices. Participants (N = 596) completed a self-administered questionnaire. Descriptive analysis, the Pearson chi-squared test, and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed.The major inappropriate antibiotic use practices followed by the respondents were using antibiotics without prescription (82%), not completing the antibiotic course (45%), and obtaining antibiotics from the pharmacy without prescription (23%). The chi-square test results showed that age (p = 0.031) and nationality (p = 0.041) were associated with using antibiotics without prescription. In addition, respondents less than 21 years of age (p<0.001), who had only a secondary education (p = 0.007), and who lived in one of the large and crowded cities in Qatar (p = 0.011) had higher odds of stopping the antibiotic before completing the course. Our study also revealed that almost 60% of the respondents had inadequate knowledge and a negative attitude towards antibiotic use. Nationality and municipality were the independent factors associated with having appropriate knowledge of antibiotic use. Univariate logistic regression analyses in our study demonstrated that older (>26 years), married and university-graduated participants were more likely to have a positive attitude towards antibiotic use than others. Respondents also reported that neither doctors nor pharmacists were providing adequate patient education about appropriate antibiotic use. The Socio-Ecological Model was applied to interpret the findings and frame implications.The findings shed light on various factors shaping antibiotic use practices and provide evidence to design multilevel behavioral interventions to improve public practices of antibiotic use."
https://openalex.org/W2990985577,"The biodistribution of AAVHSC7, AAVHSC15, and AAVHSC17 following systemic delivery was assessed in cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis). Animals received a single intravenous (IV) injection of a self-complementary AAVHSC-enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) vector and tissues were harvested at two weeks post-dose for anti-eGFP immunohistochemistry and vector genome analyses. IV delivery of AAVHSC vectors produced widespread distribution of eGFP staining in glial cells throughout the central nervous system, with the highest levels seen in the pons and lateral geniculate nuclei (LGN). eGFP-positive neurons were also observed throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems for all three AAVHSC vectors including brain, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) with staining evident in neuronal cell bodies, axons and dendritic arborizations. Co-labeling of sections from brain, spinal cord, and DRG with anti-eGFP antibodies and cell-specific markers confirmed eGFP-staining in neurons and glia, including protoplasmic and fibrous astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. For all capsids tested, 50 to 70% of glial cells (S100-β+) and on average 8% of neurons (NeuroTrace+) in the LGN were positive for eGFP expression. In the DRG, 45 to 62% of neurons and 8 to 12% of satellite cells were eGFP-positive for the capsids tested. eGFP staining was also observed in peripheral tissues with abundant staining in hepatocytes, skeletal- and cardio-myocytes and in acinar cells of the pancreas. Biodistribution of AAVHSC vector genomes in the central and peripheral organs generally correlated with eGFP staining and were highest in the liver for all AAVHSC vectors tested. These data demonstrate that AAVHSCs have broad tissue tropism and cross the blood-nerve and blood-brain-barriers following systemic delivery in nonhuman primates, making them suitable gene editing or gene transfer vectors for therapeutic application in human genetic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2990143274,"Background In acute kidney injury (AKI), medication dosing based on Cockcroft-Gault creatinine clearance (CrCl) or Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) are not valid when serum creatinine (SCr) is not in steady state. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of a kinetic estimating equation that incorporates fluctuations in SCrs on drug dosing in critically ill patients. Methods We used data from participants enrolled in the NIH Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network Fluid and Catheters Treatment Trial to simulate drug dosing category changes with the application of the kinetic estimating equation developed by Chen. We evaluated whether kinetic estimation of renal function would change medication dosing categories (≥60, 30–59, 15–29, and <15mL/min) compared with the use of CrCl or CKD-EPI eGFR. Results The use of kinetic CrCl and CKD-EPI eGFR resulted in a large enough change in estimated renal function to require medication dosing recategorization in 19.3% [95 CI 16.8%–21.9%] and 23.4% [95% CI 20.7%–26.1%] of participants, respectively. As expected, recategorization occurred more frequently in those with AKI. When we examined individual days for those with AKI, dosing discordance was observed in 8.5% of total days using the CG CrCl and 10.2% of total days using the CKD-EPI equation compared with the kinetic counterparts. Conclusion In a critically ill population, use of kinetic estimates of renal function impacted medication dosing in a substantial proportion of AKI participants. Use of kinetic estimates in clinical practice should lower the incidence of medication toxicity as well as avoid subtherapeutic dosing during renal recovery."

https://openalex.org/W2990987786,"Aims Patients with aortic stenosis (AS) may have concomitant heart failure (HF) that determines prognosis despite successful transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We compared outcomes of TAVI patients with low stroke volume index (SVI) ≤35 ml/m2 body surface area in different HF classes. Methods and results Patients treated by transfemoral TAVI at our center (n = 1822) were classified as 1) ‘HF with preserved ejection fraction (EF)’ (HFpEF, EF ≥50%), 2) ‘HF with mid-range EF’ (HFmrEF, EF 40–49%), or 3) ‘HF with reduced EF’ (HFrEF, EF <40%). Patients with SVI >35 ml/m2 served as controls. The prevalence of cardiovascular disease and symptoms increased stepwise from controls (n = 968) to patients with HFpEF (n = 591), HFmrEF (n = 97), and HFrEF (n = 166). Mortality tended to be highest in HFrEF patients 30 days post-procedure, and it became significant after one year: 10.2% (controls), 13.5% (HFpEF), 13.4% (HFmrEF), and 23.5% (HFrEF). However, symptomatic improvement in survivors of all groups was achieved in the majority of patients without differences among groups. Conclusions Patients with AS and HF benefit from TAVI with respect to symptom alleviation. TAVI in patients with HFpEF and HFmrEF led to an identical, favorable post-procedural prognosis that was significantly better than that of patients with HFrEF, which remains a high-risk population."
https://openalex.org/W2989944820,"Genetic lineage tracing is widely used to study organ development and tissue regeneration. Multicolor reporters are a powerful platform for simultaneously tracking discrete cell populations. Here, combining Dre-rox and Cre-loxP systems, we generated a new dual-recombinase reporter system, called Rosa26 traffic light reporter ( R26-TLR ), to monitor red, green, and yellow fluorescence. Using this new reporter system with the three distinct fluorescent reporters combined on one allele, we found that the readouts of the two recombinases Cre and Dre simultaneously reflect Cre + Dre − , Cre − Dre + , and Cre + Dre + cell lineages. As proof of principle, we show specific labeling in three distinct progenitor/stem cell populations, including club cells, AT2 cells, and bronchoalveolar stem cells, in Sftpc-DreER;Scgb1a1-CreER;R26-TLR mice. By using this new dual-recombinase reporter system, we simultaneously traced the cell fate of these three distinct cell populations during lung repair and regeneration, providing a more comprehensive picture of stem cell function in distal airway repair and regeneration. We propose that this new reporter system will advance developmental and regenerative research by facilitating a more sophisticated genetic approach to studying in vivo cell fate plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2989752477,"Introduction Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in the western world and is highly associated with multiple cardiometabolic complications. The Zhejiang University (ZJU) index was first developed to predict NAFLD in Chinese populations, where it was shown to have better predictive value than other currently used indices. The aims of the present study were to 1) determine the diagnostic accuracy of ZJU index in identifying NAFLD in a well-phenotyped cohort of obese middle-aged American women and 2) compare its performance with other non-invasive indices for NAFLD identification. Methods To achieve this goal, we performed a retrospective analysis of a prospectively-collected cohort of participants enrolled in a weight loss trial for severe obesity (RENEW, clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00712127). One hundred and seven women between the age of 30 and 55 with obesity class II (BMI 35–39.9 kg/m2) or class III (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2) were recruited for analyses. Hepatic steatosis was measured using liver/spleen attenuation ratio (L/S ratio) from unenhanced abdominal computed tomography. Beside ZJU index, hepatic steatosis index (HSI), lipid accumulation production index (LAPI), and visceral adiposity index (VAI) were also determined and to compare their performance in predicting NAFLD. Results Of 107 obese women in the study, 40 (37.4%) met imaging criteria for NAFLD using cut-off value of L/S ratio < 1.1. The ZJU index was positively correlated with HIS, LAPI, but not VAI. The area under the curve was highest for the ZJU index (AUC = 0.742, 95% CI:0.647–0.837), followed by HSI (AUC = 0.728, 95% CI:0.631–0.825), LAPI (AUC = 0.682, CI:0.583–0.781), and VAI (AUC = 0.621, 95% CI:0.518–0.725), respectively, using the Youden method. Conclusion The ZJU index is a powerful surrogate marker for NAFLD in severely obese western females and its predictive value was better than that of other commonly used indices for predicting NAFLD. Our study is the first to suggest that the ZJU index could be a promising model for use in western as well as Chinese populations."

The technique presented here using deadCas9 is easier to implement for gene silencing in Synechocystis PCC6803 than other existing techniques as it circumvents the genome integration and segregation steps thereby significantly shortens the construction of the mutant strains. We executed CRISPR interference against well characterized photosynthetic genes to get a clear phenotype to validate the potential of pCRPB1010 and presented the work as a ""proof of concept"". Targeting the non-template strand of psbO gene resulted in decreased amount of PsbO and 50% decrease in oxygen evolution rate. Targeting the template strand of psbA2 and psbA3 genes encoding the D1 subunit of photosystem II (PSII) using a single spacer against the common sequence span of the two genes, resulted in full inhibition of both genes, complete abolition of D1 protein synthesis, complete loss of oxygen evolution as well as photoautotrophic growth arrest.

We conducted a seroprevalence study to evaluate the antibodies to measles and rubella virus among Thais of all ages and to determine pre-existing immunity resulting from either vaccination and/or natural exposure. A total of 1,781 serum samples collected in 2014 was tested for IgG to measles and rubella virus by commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Percentages of individuals with protective antibody levels and the geometric mean concentrations (GMC) of IgG in each age group were analysed. The GMC of anti-measles IgG and anti-rubella IgG were 653.7 IU/L (95% confidence interval (CI); 555.9-751.4) and 39.5 IU/mL (95% CI;35.0-43.9), respectively. Thais between the ages of six months and 25 years did not demonstrate sufficient protective herd immunity for measles. This observation is consistent with the recent measles outbreaks in this age group. Lower prevalence of immunity against rubella was found among children ages 5-6 years who may not have completed vaccination as infants. Our findings identify gaps in rubella and measles immunity in specific age groups and support recommendations for catch-up MMR vaccination in individuals 30 years of age or younger."
https://openalex.org/W2990887256,"Interleukin (IL)-38 is a member of the IL-1 family of cytokines, which was proposed to exert anti-inflammatory effects. IL-38 is constitutively expressed in the skin, where keratinocytes are the main producing cells. Little information is currently available concerning IL-38 biology. Here, we investigated the subcellular localization and interaction partners of the IL-38 protein in human keratinocytes. IL-38 expression was reduced in primary keratinocytes grown in monolayer (2D) cultures. We thus used IL-38 overexpressing immortalized normal human keratinocytes (NHK/38) to study this cytokine in cell monolayers. In parallel, differentiation of primary human keratinocytes in an in vitro reconstructed human epidermis (RHE) 3D model allowed us to restore endogenous IL-38 expression. In NHK/38 cells and in RHE, IL-38 was mainly cell-associated, rather than released into culture supernatants. Intracellular IL-38 was preferentially, although not exclusively, cytoplasmic. Similarly, in normal human skin sections, IL-38 was predominantly cytoplasmic in the epidermis and essentially excluded from keratinocyte nuclei. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified destrin/actin-depolymerizing factor (DSTN) as a potential IL-38-interacting molecule. Co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assay confirmed this interaction. We further observed partial co-localization of IL-38 and DSTN in NHK/38 cells. Endogenous IL-38 and DSTN were also co-expressed in all epidermal layers in RHE and in normal human skin. Finally, IL-38 partially co-localized with F-actin in NHK/38 cells, in particular along the cortical actin network and in filopodia. In conclusion, IL-38 is found predominantly in the cytoplasm of human keratinocytes, where it interacts with DSTN. The functional relevance of this interaction remains to be investigated."
https://openalex.org/W2991140016,"Golgi reassembly and stacking protein 65 (GRASP65), which has been involved in cancer progression, is associated with tumor growth and cell apoptosis. Dihydromyricetin (DHM) has demonstrated antitumor activity in different types of human cancers. However, the pharmacological effects of DHM on ovarian cancer (OC) and the molecular mechanisms that underlie these effects are largely unknown. The present study showed that DHM reduced cell migration and invasion in a concentration- and time-dependent manner and induced cell apoptosis primarily through upregulation of Cleaved-caspase-3 and the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in OCs. To further clarify the cancer therapeutic target, we assessed the effect of DHM on the expression of GRASP65, which is overexpressed in human ovarian cancer tissues. DHM activated caspase-3 and decreased GRASP65 expression to promote cell apoptosis, implying that downregulation of GRASP65 was related to DHM-induced cell apoptosis. Additionally, the knockdown of GRASP65 by siRNA resulted in increased apoptosis after DHM treatment, while western blot and flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that overexpression of GRASP65 attenuated DHM-mediated apoptosis. In addition, the JNK/ERK pathway may be involved in DHM-mediated caspase-3 activation and GRASP65 downregulation. Taken together, these findings provide novel evidence of the anti-cancer properties of DHM in OCs, indicating that DHM is a potential therapeutic agent for ovarian cancer through the inhibition of GRASP65 expression and the regulation of JNK/ERK pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2991129647,"Background and objective Over recent decades, a progressive increase in the maternal age at childbirth has been observed in developed countries, posing a health risk for both women and infants. The aim of this study was to analyze the association between advanced maternal age (AMA) and maternal and neonatal morbidity. Material and methods A cross-sectional study of 3,315 births was conducted in the north of Spain in 2014. We compared childbirth between women aged 35 years or older, with a reference group of women aged between 24 and 27 years. AMA was categorized based on ordinal ranking into 35–38 years, 39–42 years, and >42 years to estimate a dose-response pattern (the older the age, the greater the risk). As an association measure, crude and adjusted Odds Ratios (OR) were estimated by non-conditional logistic regression and 95% Confidence Intervals (95%CI) were calculated. Results Repeated abortions were more common among women of AMA in comparison to pregnant women aged 24–27 years (reference group): adjusted OR = 2.68; 95%CI (1.52–4.73). A higher prevalence of gestational diabetes was also observed among women of AMA, reaching statistical significance when restricted to first time mothers: adjusted OR = 8.55; 95%CI (1.12–65.43). In addition, the possibility of an instrumental delivery was multiplied by 1.6 and the possibility of a cesarean by 1.5 among women of AMA, with these results reaching statistical significance, and observing a dose-response pattern. Lastly, there were associations between preeclampsia, preterm birth (<37 weeks) and low birthweight, however without reaching statistical significance. Conclusion Our results support the association between AMA and suffering repeated abortions. Likewise, being of AMA was associated with a greater risk of suffering from gestational diabetes, especially among primiparous women, as well as being associated with both instrumental deliveries and cesareans among both primiparous and multiparous women."
https://openalex.org/W2991284144,"Bacterial pneumonia causes significant economic loss to the beef industry and occurs at times of stress and viral infection. Administering antibiotics to at-risk calves is often used to prevent the disease, but alternatives to mass treatment with antibiotics are needed. Tracheal antimicrobial peptide (TAP), a β-defensin naturally produced by bovine airways, has bactericidal activity against the pathogens that cause pneumonia in cattle. However, TAP expression is suppressed by glucocorticoid (stress) and viral infection. We hypothesized that delivering TAP to the respiratory tract would prevent development of pneumonia in calves infected with Mannheimia haemolytica. Clean-catch calves (i.e. obtained prior to contact with the dam) were challenged by aerosol with M. haemolytica, and TAP or water was delivered to the respiratory tract at 0.3, 2 and 6 hours post-infection. TAP treatment did not protect against development of disease. Calves treated with TAP had similar bacterial loads in the nasal cavity and lung compared to calves treated with water. Similarly, TAP treatment did not affect the development of clinical signs, elevated rectal temperatures, or increased levels of blood neutrophils, haptoglobin and fibrinogen that occurred after bacterial challenge. Postmortem gross and histologic lung lesions were also similar in the two groups. To determine why there was a lack of protective effect, we tested the effect of substances in respiratory lining fluid on the bactericidal activity of TAP. Physiologic concentrations of sodium chloride inhibited TAP bactericidal activity in vitro, as did serum at concentrations of 0.62 to 2.5%, but concentrated bronchoalveolar lavage fluid had no consistent effect. These findings suggest that TAP does not have in vivo bactericidal activity against M. haemolytica because of interference by physiological sodium chloride levels and by serum. Thus, administration of TAP may not be effective for prevention of M. haemolytica pneumonia."
https://openalex.org/W2989789725,"The accurate detection of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, such as inattentiveness and behavioral disinhibition, is crucial for delivering timely assistance and treatment. ADHD is commonly diagnosed and studied with specialized questionnaires and behavioral tests such as the stop-signal task. However, in cases of late-onset or mild forms of ADHD, behavioral measures often fail to gauge the deficiencies well-highlighted by questionnaires. To improve the sensitivity of behavioral tests, we propose a novel version of the stop-signal task (SST), which integrates mouse cursor tracking. In two studies, we investigated whether introducing mouse movement measures to the stop-signal task improves associations with questionnaire-based measures, as compared to the traditional (keypress-based) version of SST. We also scrutinized the influence of different parameters of stop-signal tasks, such as the method of stop-signal delay setting or definition of response inhibition failure, on these associations. Our results show that a) SSRT has weak association with impulsivity, while mouse movement measures have strong and significant association with impulsivity; b) machine learning models trained on the mouse movement data from ""known"" participants using nested cross-validation procedure can accurately predict impulsivity ratings of ""unknown"" participants; c) mouse movement features such as maximum acceleration and maximum velocity are among the most important predictors for impulsivity; d) using preset stop-signal delays prompts behavior that is more indicative of impulsivity."
https://openalex.org/W2990400691,"Increasing prevalence of sedentary behavior (SB) combined with low levels of physical activity (PA) in children and adolescents has become a growing public health concern. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the daily behavioral pattern of adolescents and examine the isotemporal substitution effects of SB with light-intensity PA (LIPA) or moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) on cardiometabolic markers. In this cross-sectional study, the daily behavioral pattern of Brazilian male adolescents was objectively measured for 7 days. Vector magnitude activity counts were used to estimate SB, LIPA, and MVPA with cut-points specifically validated for youth. The isotemporal substitution model was used to assess the effects of replacing different SB bouts (5, 10, 30, and 60 min) with LIPA or MVPA on cardiometabolic markers [body mass index, waist circumference, body fat percentage (BF%), total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), non-HDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), glucose, insulin, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR), insulin sensitivity (HOMA2-S), beta cell function (HOMA2-β), systolic-blood pressure (SBP), diastolic-blood pressure, and cardiometabolic risk score]. Male adolescents (n = 84; age, 16.7 ± 0.9 years) wore the GT3X+ for 6.7 ± 0.6 days, during 15.2 ± 2.3 h, and spent 72.9% of the time in SB, 17.3% in LIPA, and 9.8% in MVPA. SB replacement with LIPA was associated with increased HDL-C, TG, HOMA2-IR, and HOMA2-S and decreased SBP. In contrast, SB replacement with MVPA was associated with decreased BF%. Therefore, our findings suggest that replacing SB with LIPA showed positive results on HDL-C, HOMA2-S and SBP, while replacing SB with MVPA was associated with only one obesity indicator (BF%). Moreover, participants met the daily MVPA recommendations, but they still had a daily behavioral pattern with high SB. In this context, LIPAs can be considered an effective alternative to reduce SB and improve the health indicators of this population."

We aimed to study the association of circulating iPTH with 25(OH)D concentrations and to determine a 25(OH)D threshold associated with a significant iPTH suppression. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 198 boys and 180 girls, aged 6-13 years with BMI ≥ 1SD (WHO criteria) recruited from primary schools. Adjusted iPTH for BMI z-score, pubertal status, and dietary calcium was used. Nonlinear regression was used to model the relationship between 25(OH)D and iPTH and identify a suppression point for 25(OH)D at which iPTH reached a plateau. Piecewise regression analysis with a single knot for all possible values of 25(OH)D were fitted. Furthermore, 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) for those point had been calculated. The mean age (SD) of girls and boys was 9.1 (1.6) and 9.4 (1.7) years, respectively. Median 25(OH)D and iPTH were 13.8 ng/mL and 33.9 pg/mL in boys and 9.9 ng/mL and 47.8 ng/mL in girls, respectively. The equation in girls was: log-iPTH = 3.598+0.868 exp[(-0.190×25(OH)D. The point for near maximal suppression of iPTH by 25(OH)D for girls occurred at a 25(OH)D concentration of 20 ng/mL (95% CI: 7.1 to 32.2). No point of maximal suppression was found for boys. We also found a 25(OH)D threshold of 10 ng/mL (95% CI: 4.6 to 22.5) for girls (f: 9.8) by linear piecewise regression modeling of adjusted iPTH. No significant inflection point for boys was observed. In overweight/obese girls, when the concentration of 25(OH)D was higher than 20 ng/mL, an iPTH mean plateau level is reached, and when its concentrations approach 10 ng/mL, the slope of iPTH concentration has been accelerated."
https://openalex.org/W2991366453,"Myanmar undergoes rapid urban expansion and experiences its negative impacts, often due to the loss of urban green spaces. National and local authorities lack sufficient knowledge, capacity and plans on how to preserve urban green spaces and benefit from their ecosystem services, with such gaps being particularly pronounced in the smaller secondary cities. This study focuses in such as secondary city, Pyin Oo Lwin, and analyzes land use and land cover (LULC) change, tree diversity and carbon stored in aboveground and belowground biomass, and soil. We focus on the main green spaces of the city, which contain different configurations of urban forest, grassland and agricultural land. Remote sensing analysis tracked LULC change between 1988 and 2018, and showed the extensive increase of built-up area, and the decline of urban forests and urban farms. Even though a substantial amount of green spaces has been converted to built-up land, the remaining urban green spaces are still serving as an important habitat for many different tree species, with a total of 82 species from 35 families observed in the different green spaces. Furthermore, these green spaces contain significant carbon stocks, which are, however, highly variable: botanical garden (383.67 t/ha), coffee farms (355.64 t/ha), monasteries (277.14 t/ha), golf course (208.45 t/ha), and seasonal farms (123.22 t/ha). Nevertheless, the extensive LULC change has reduced carbon stocks from 2.41 Mt (1988) to 1.65 Mt (2018). The findings of this study provide a better understanding of LULC change in secondary cities of Myanmar, and build an evidence base on how urban green spaces preservation and green infrastructure development can contribute to green economic transitions, and sustainable, resilient, and low-carbon cities in the country."
https://openalex.org/W2990116351,"The failure of mRNA translation machinery to recognize a stop codon as a termination signal and subsequent translation of the 3’ untranslated region (UTR) is referred to as stop codon readthrough, the frequency of which is related to the length, composition, and structure of mRNA sequences downstream of end-of-gene stop codons. Secondary in-frame stop codons within a few positions downstream of the primary stop codons, so-called tandem stop codons (TSCs), serve as backup termination signals, which limit the effects of readthrough: polypeptide product degradation, mislocalization, and aggregation. In this study, ciliate species with UAA and UAG stop codons reassigned to code for glutamine are found to possess statistical excesses of TSCs at the beginning of their 3’ UTRs. The overrepresentation of TSCs in these species is greater than that observed in standard code organisms. Though the overall numbers of TSCs are lower in most species with alternative stop codons because they use fewer than three unique stop codons, the relatively great overrepresentation of TSCs in alternative-code ciliate species suggests that there exist stronger selective pressures to maintain TSCs in these organisms compared to standard code organisms."

https://openalex.org/W2989974843,"As the life sciences have become more data intensive, the pressure to incorporate the requisite training into life-science education and training programs has increased. To facilitate curriculum development, various sets of (bio)informatics competencies have been articulated; however, these have proved difficult to implement in practice. Addressing this issue, we have created a curriculum-design and -evaluation tool to support the development of specific Knowledge, Skills and Abilities (KSAs) that reflect the scientific method and promote both bioinformatics practice and the achievement of competencies. Twelve KSAs were extracted via formal analysis, and stages along a developmental trajectory, from uninitiated student to independent practitioner, were identified. Demonstration of each KSA by a performer at each stage was initially described (Performance Level Descriptors, PLDs), evaluated, and revised at an international workshop. This work was subsequently extended and further refined to yield the Mastery Rubric for Bioinformatics (MR-Bi). The MR-Bi was validated by demonstrating alignment between the KSAs and competencies, and its consistency with principles of adult learning. The MR-Bi tool provides a formal framework to support curriculum building, training, and self-directed learning. It prioritizes the development of independence and scientific reasoning, and is structured to allow individuals (regardless of career stage, disciplinary background, or skill level) to locate themselves within the framework. The KSAs and their PLDs promote scientific problem formulation and problem solving, lending the MR-Bi durability and flexibility. With its explicit developmental trajectory, the tool can be used by developing or practicing scientists to direct their (and their team’s) acquisition of new, or to deepen existing, bioinformatics KSAs. The MR-Bi is a tool that can contribute to the cultivation of a next generation of bioinformaticians who are able to design reproducible and rigorous research, and to critically analyze results from their own, and others’, work."
https://openalex.org/W2990183979,"The diagnosis of celiac disease (CD) is currently based on serology and intestinal biopsy, with detection of anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) IgA antibodies recommended as the first-line test. Emphasizing the increasing importance of serological testing, new guidelines and evidence suggest basing the diagnosis solely on serology without confirmatory biopsy. Enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) are the established approach for anti-tTG antibody detection, with the existing point-of-care (POC) tests lacking sensitivity and/or specificity. Improved POC methods could help reduce the underdiagnosis and diagnostic delay of CD. We have previously developed rapid homogenous immunoassays based on time-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET), and demonstrated their suitability in serodiagnostics with hanta- and Zika virus infections as models. In this study, we set out to establish a protein L -based TR-FRET assay (LFRET) for the detection of anti-tTG antibodies. We studied 74 patients with biopsy-confirmed CD and 70 healthy controls, with 1) the new tTG-LFRET assay, and for reference 2) a well-established EIA and 3) an existing commercial POC test. IgG depletion was employed to differentiate between anti-tTG IgA and IgG positivity. The sensitivity and specificity of the first-generation tTG-LFRET POC assay in detection of CD were 87.8% and 94.3%, respectively, in line with those of the reference POC test. The sensitivity and specificity of EIA were 95.9% and 91.9%, respectively. This study demonstrates the applicability of LFRET to serological diagnosis of autoimmune diseases in general and of CD in particular."
https://openalex.org/W2991538981,"Many people report disliking taxes despite the fact that tax funds are used to provide essential services for the taxpayer and fellow citizens. In light of past research demonstrating that people are more likely to engage in prosocial action when they recognize how their assistance positively impacts the recipient, we examine whether recognition of how one’s tax contributions help other citizens–perceived prosocial taxation–predicts more supportive views of taxation and greater engagement. We conducted three correlational studies using North American samples (N = 902, including a nationally representative sample of over 500 US residents) in which we find that perceived prosocial taxation is associated with greater enjoyment paying taxes, willingness to continue paying taxes, and larger financial contributions in a tax-like payment. Findings hold when controlling for several demographic variables, participants’ general prosocial orientation, and the perception that tax dollars are being put to good use. In addition, we examined data from six waves of the World Values Survey (N > 474,000 across 107 countries). We find that people expressing trust in their government and civil service–thereby indicating some confidence that their taxes will be used in prosocial ways–are significantly more likely to state that it is never justifiable to cheat on taxes. Together, these studies offer a new and optimistic perspective on taxation; people may hold more positive views and be more willing to contribute if they believe their contribution benefits others."

AA gradually decreases with increasing age. However, details of age-related diurnal changes in AA are not well known. This study compared diurnal changes in AA in the adolescents, the twenties, and the forties age groups. Measurement of AA using the push-up method was performed in six sessions at two-hourly intervals for 154 subjects (48, 56, 50 subjects for the adolescents, twenties, and forties age groups, respectively); the first measurements were taken from 9:00–10:00 a.m. and the final measurements from 7:00–8:00 p.m. The mean AA was 14.67 D (highest: 16.15 D in the 3:00–4:00 p.m. session, lowest: 13.35 D in the 9:00–10:00 a.m. session) for the adolescent group; 11.13 D (highest: 11.69 D in the 3:00–4:00 p.m. session; lowest: 10.61 D in the 9:00–10:00 a.m. session) in the twenties group; and 5.53 D (highest: 5.80 D in the 1:00–2:00 p.m. session, lowest: 5.11 D in the 7:00–8:00 p.m. session) in the forties age group. The measured AA showed significant difference between sessions; however, diurnal variations were greater in the younger groups. The measured AA was low at the beginning of the day in the adolescents and twenties groups and low at the end of the day in the forties age group. All age groups showed a high AA during the afternoon hours of the day (1:00–4:00 p.m.). Since the difference between each session was larger in younger subjects, AA should be evaluated while taking the age-related diurnal variations into account."
https://openalex.org/W2991095594,"Background Liver ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) remains a challenge in liver transplantation. A number of compounds have previously demonstrated efficacy in mitigating IRI. Herein, we applied three specific additive strategies to a mouse IRI screening model to determine their relative potencies in reducing such injury, with a view to future testing in a large animal and clinical ex situ normothermic perfusion setting: 1) F573, a pan-caspase inhibitor, 2) anti-inflammatory anakinra and etanrecept and 3) BMX-001, a mimetic of superoxide dismutase. Methods A non-lethal liver ischemia model in mice was used. Additives in the treatment groups were given at fixed time points before induction of injury, compared to a vehicle group that received no therapeutic treatment. Mice were recovered for 6 hours following the ischemic insult, at which point blood and tissue samples were obtained. Plasma was processed for transaminase levels. Whole liver tissue samples were processed for histology, markers of apoptosis, oxidative stress, and cytokine levels. Results In an in vivo murine IRI model, the F573 treatment group demonstrated statistically lower alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (p = 0.01), less evidence of apoptosis (p = 0.03), and lower cytokine levels compared to vehicle. The etanercept with anakinra treatment group demonstrated significantly lower cytokine levels. The BMX-001 group demonstrated significantly decreased apoptosis (p = 0.01) evident on TUNEL staining. Conclusions The administration of pan-caspase inhibitor F573 in a murine in vivo model likely mitigates liver IRI based on decreased markers of cellular injury, decreased evidence of apoptosis, and improved cytokine profiles. Anakinra with etanercept, and BMX-001 did not demonstrate convincing efficacy at reducing IRI in this model, and likely need further optimization. The positive findings set rational groundwork for future translational studies of applying F573 during normothermic ex situ liver perfusion, with the aim of improving the quality of marginal grafts."

Here, we report HIV-1 genetic diversity and DRMs in blood samples from 42 HIV-positive pregnant women naive to antiretroviral therapy (ART), in Luanda. The samples were subjected to nested-PCR, followed by sequencing of HIV-1 pol gene, targeting the protease and reverse transcriptase fragments. HIV-1 diversity was analyzed using the REGA HIV-1 subtyping tool and DRMs were identified using the Calibrated Population Resistance tool. A total of 34 sequences were obtained. The data revealed wide HIV-1 subtypes heterogeneity, with subtype C (38%, 13/34) the most frequent, followed by the subtypes F1 (18%, 6/34), A1 (9%, 3/34), G (9%, 3/34), D (6%, 2/34) and H (3%, 1/34). In addition, recombinants strains were detected, with CRF02_AG (6%, 2/34) the most frequent, followed by CRF37_cpx, F1/C, A1/G and H/G, all with 3% (1/34). A total of 6/34 (18%) of the sequences presented DRMs. The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors presented 15% (5/34) of resistance. Moreover, 1/34 (3%) sequence presented resistance against both non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, simultaneously.

https://openalex.org/W2991441389,"Background There is a high level of interest in international experiences during United States (U.S.) ophthalmology residency training among both program directors and trainees. Methods An electronic invitation to a 26-question survey was sent to all 114 U.S. ophthalmology residency program directors. The invitation requested that the survey be completed by the one faculty member who was most involved in overseeing the international experiences for the residents. The survey consisted of multiple choice and Likert-type scale questions. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for analysis of demographic data and Friedman’s test and Wilcoxon-Signed Rank test were used to analyze ranked responses. Results Responses were obtained from 70 faculty mentors representing unique programs, yielding a response rate of 61.4%. The majority of programs that responded (88.6%, n = 62) either offered international ophthalmology experiences for residents or supported residents finding their own experiences to go abroad. International experience participation rate among residents correlated with the number of years the experiences had been offered by the programs (p = 0.001). More than half of the respondents (55.0%, n = 33) felt that the residents benefited more than the hosts during these international experiences. Approximately half of the respondents (51.6%, n = 32) believed that additional training beyond what is covered in the standard curriculum to practice ophthalmology in the U.S. is necessary for practicing ophthalmology in an international setting. Conclusions There is high interest and participation in international experiences within U.S. ophthalmology residency programs. This high participation warrants further investigation into the long-term impact of these international experiences and how U.S. residency programs can structure these experiences to maximize the benefits to both the residents and the international host communities."
https://openalex.org/W2990058491,"The Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signalling pathway plays multiple roles during embryonic development and under pathological conditions. Although the core components of the Shh pathway are conserved, the regulation of signal transduction varies significantly among species and cell types. Protein kinases Ulk3 and Pka are involved in the Shh pathway as modulators of the activities of Gli transcription factors, which are the nuclear mediators of the signal. Here, we investigate the regulation and activities of two GLI1 isoforms, full-length GLI1 (GLI1FL) and GLI1ΔN. The latter protein lacks the first 128 amino acids including the conserved phosphorylation cluster and the binding motif for SUFU, the key regulator of GLI activity. Both GLI1 isoforms are co-expressed in all human cell lines analysed and possess similar DNA binding activity. ULK3 potentiates the transcriptional activity of both GLI1 proteins, whereas PKA inhibits the activity of GLI1ΔN, but not GLI1FL. In addition to its well-established role as a transcriptional activator, GLI1FL acts as a repressor by inhibiting transcription from the early promoters of human papillomavirus type 18 (HPV18). Additionally, compared to GLI1ΔN, GLI1FL is a more potent suppressor of replication of several HPV types. Altogether, our data show that the N-terminal part of GLI1FL is crucial for the realization of its full potential as a transcriptional regulator."
https://openalex.org/W2990123276,"Background Methylprednisolone remains a commonly used ancillary therapy for paediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS), despite a lack of level 1 evidence to justify its use. When planning prospective trials it is useful to define response to therapy and to identify if there is differential response in certain patients, i.e. existence of ‘responders’ and ‘non responders’ to therapy. This retrospective, observational study carried out in 2 tertiary referral paediatric intensive care units aims to characterize the change in Oxygen Saturation Index, following the administration of low dose methylprednisolone in a cohort of patients with PARDS, to identify what proportion of children treated demonstrated response, whether any particular characteristics predict response to therapy, and to determine if a positive response to corticosteroids is associated with reduced Paediatric Intensive Care Unit mortality. Methods All patients who received prolonged, low dose, IV methylprednisolone for the specific indication of PARDS over a 5-year period (2011–2016) who met the PALICC criteria for PARDS at the time of commencement of steroid were included (n = 78).OSI was calculated four times per day from admission until discharge from PICU (or death). Patients with ≥20% improvement in their mean daily OSI within 72 hours of commencement of methylprednisolone were classified as ‘responders’. Primary outcome measure was survival to PICU discharge. Results Mean OSI of the cohort increased until the day of steroid commencement then improved thereafter. 59% of patients demonstrated a response to steroids. Baseline characteristics were similar between responders and non-responders. Survival to PICU discharge was significantly higher in ‘responders’ (74% vs 41% OR 4.14(1.57–10.87) p = 0.004). On multivariable analysis using likely confounders, response to steroid was an independent predictor of survival to PICU discharge (p = 0.002). Non-responders died earlier after steroid administration than responders (p = 0.003). Conclusions An improvement in OSI was observed in 60% of patients following initiation of low dose methylprednisolone therapy in this cohort of patients with PARDS. Baseline characteristics fail to demonstrate a difference between responders and non-responders. A 20% improvement in OSI after commencement of methylprednisolone was independently predictive of survival, Prospective trials are needed to establish if there is a benefit from this therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2990292394,"An upward trend is observed in the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes (T2D) in South-East Asian and Western Pacific regions. These patterns incur a costly health burden to developing nations around the world. A clear understanding of the mechanics behind self-management practices of T2D patients might help overcome this impasse. This information can help unlock specific problem areas that warrant specific intervention. We aim to uncover prevailing T2D self-management habits and its deviations from optimal behaviour.We adopted a Grounded Theory approach to guide in-depth interviews (IDI) with T2D patients and healthcare providers (HCP) at a regional primary care clinic in Malaysia. Twenty-four T2D patients and 10 HCPs were recruited through purposive sampling to examine their inner psychological narratives related to self-management practices. 2 focus group discussions (FGD) were conducted as a part of the data triangulation process.A functional framework for self-management practices in T2D patients was developed. Self-management behavior was characterized by 2 major processes- 1) helpful and, 2) unhelpful practices. Self-efficacy, taking responsibility and being rational define helpful behaviour in these patients. On the other hand, unhelpful traits (neglect, poor restraint, and experimentation) often trigger violations with regards to medication compliance and therapeutic lifestyle changes.We outlined a roadmap that navigates through the positive and negative mindset in relation to self-management practices of T2D patients. These results highlight the importance of devising individualized strategies by taking into account the personal challenges, emotions, and motivations that define the inner self of the patient."
https://openalex.org/W2990369591,"Documenting the different social and behavioural contexts that vocalisations are produced in remains an important step towards understanding the functional relevance of specific call types in a given species’ vocal repertoire. In this study we investigated whether seasonal differences and the presence or absence of male and female conspecifics influence the production of male giant panda vocal signals. To this end, captive male giant pandas were observed during and outside of the breeding season in three social contexts: only male conspecific neighbours, only female conspecific neighbours, and a context with no neighbours. We found that males were more likely to bleat, chirp, honk and moan during the breeding season, and showed a tendency to growl more outside of the reproductive period. The contextual analysis revealed that bleats were more likely to be produced by males when opposite-sexed conspecifics are in close attendance during the breeding season. Conversely, males were more likely to chirp when neighboured by males than females or no neighbours. In addition, males were more likely to honk in the absence of neighbouring conspecifics during the breeding season, raising the possibility that these calls function to signal location and gain the attention of potential mates. Moans were produced more often when male giant pandas had male than female neighbours during the breeding season, which may reflect mild aggression towards these same-sexed rivals, whereas the production of barks and growls did not vary according to season or the sex of conspecific neighbours. Our findings underscore the importance of male giant panda bleats for coordinating reproduction and promoting contact with potential mating partners in this non-gregarious species, and yield fresh insights into the function of male honks that warrant further investigation. They also provide a basis for comparison with free-ranging giant panda vocal behaviour that could potentially inform conservation efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2991493316,"As debate rumbles on about whether anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) nucleos(t)ide analogue treatments modulate host immune system during end-stage liver diseases, we studied effects of two potent anti-HBV agents, telbivudine or entecavir, on humoral immune activities including cytokine secretion, immunoglobulin production, and IgG-Fc agalactosylation, which is known to induce proinflammatory responses, in liver cirrhosis. Serum IgG-Fc N-glycan structures in patients with HBV-related liver cirrhosis, who had received either telbivudine treatment or entecavir treatment for at least 48 weeks were analyzed using liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry. Levels of cytokines and each immunoglobulin isotype were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results showed that 48 weeks of entecavir treatment caused HBV DNA loss, alanine aminotransferase normalization, and an amelioration of hypergammaglobulinemia in cirrhotic patients; however, telbivudine treatment, though possessing similar efficacies on HBV suppression and an improvement in liver inflammation to entecavir treatment, did not mitigate IgG-related hypergammaglobulinemia. Levels of IgG and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 in sera of the cirrhotic patients before and during treatment were positively correlated. In vitro assays revealed that telbivudine treatment induced TGF-β1 expression in human macrophagic cells. Moreover, recombinant TGF-β1 treatment stimulated cell proliferation and IgG overproduction in human IgG-producing B cell lines. Finally, we found that telbivudine treatment enhanced the proportion of serum IgG-Fc agalactosylation in cirrhotic patients, which was associated with enhanced levels of TGF-β1 and IgG. In conclusion, telbivudine therapy was associated with TGF-β1 hyperactivity, IgG-related hypergammaglobulinemia, and IgG-Fc agalactosylation in HBV-related liver cirrhosis."
https://openalex.org/W4239789084,"The Saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica) is a critically endangered species, and there has been limited success in restoring the population by captive breeding. This study assessed the biochemical and physiological parameters of newborn Saiga antelope to provide reference information that can be used to evaluate their health. Comparisons have been made with parameters for horses and closely related members of the Bovidae family but there are no reference values for the newborn Saiga antelope.Biochemical and physiological parameters were measured in 61 animals. An automatic analyzer (Hitachi Ltd. 7180 Serial, Tokyo, Japan) was used to analyze the biochemical parameters, while the Coulter counter (Model ZK) was used to analyze the physiological parameters.The results showed that the biochemical and physiological parameters differ considerably in range. The evaluation of parameters stratified by sex showed differences. Triglyceride and LDL cholesterol concentrations among male animals were significantly higher than those in female animals, while the creatine kinase concentrations were significantly higher in females than in males. Comparing this study's results with published data for horses showed many similarities and some differences. Cholesterol, magnesium and glucose levels were similar between Saiga antelope and horses, while albumin and hematocrit levels in Saiga antelope differed from the reference values in horses.The study has shown that horses and even closely related members of the Bovidae family are not suitable references when evaluating the biochemical and physiological properties of newborn Saiga antelope. These animals have unique stressors and warrant further study to inform efforts pertaining to their care and the future sustainability of the species."
https://openalex.org/W2990224868,"The risk for obesity-related disorders is proportional to the visceral region and had been observed to be highly related with impaired renal function. In the current study, we aimed to evaluate renal function impairment, according to sex, age, and different status of metabolic body composition.We retrospectively collected from the medical records the basic information and metabolic titers of Chinese adults (13,373 men and 10,175 women) who underwent health checkup from 2013 to 2016. The population was divided into four groups, according to metabolic body composition, including metabolic healthy norms-weight (MHNW), metabolic healthy obesity (MHO), metabolic unhealthy norms-weight (MUNW), and metabolic unhealthy obesity (MUO). The categorical data were compared among the groups and logistic regression analyses were conducted to investigate the association between metabolic body composition status and risk for renal function impairment.Across all ages in both sexes, the odds ratios (OR) for renal function impairment were higher in the MHO, MUNW, and MUO groups than in the MHNW group, except for women <45 years old in the MUNW group. However, after adjustment, the trend was no longer significant in all groups under 45 years old. For individuals >45 years old, the relatively high risk for renal function impairment remained significantly associated with the MUNW group (OR 2.95, 95% CI 2.02-4.30 in men and OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.35-2.82 in women) and MUO group (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.82-3.00 in men and OR 2.67, 95% CI 2.04-3.48 in women).Impaired renal function was independently associated with the status of metabolic obesity. However, the trend was only observed in individuals >45 years old, with significant sex difference."
https://openalex.org/W2991143857,"Cancer chemotherapy is frequently accompanied by adverse effects, such as diarrhoea and leukopenia, which lead to malnutrition and a decrease in the patients' quality of life. We previously demonstrated that an immune-modulating formula (IMF)-an enteral formula enriched with immunonutrients, whey-hydrolysed peptides, and fermented milk-had anti-inflammatory effects and protective effects on intestinal disorders in some experimental models. Here, we investigated whether nutritional treatment with the IMF could prevent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-induced adverse effects in rats. Rats were randomised into CTR and IMF groups, which received a control formula or the IMD supplemented formula ad libitum. Two weeks after starting the formula, rats were intraperitoneally injected with 5-FU (300 mg/kg) on day 0. The treatment with 5-FU decreased their body weights, food intake, and leukocyte counts, and worsened the diarrhoea score. However, the body weights, food intake, and leukocyte counts were significantly higher in the IMF rats than in the CTR rats on day 1. The IMF also delayed the incidence of diarrhoea and significantly preserved the villus heights in the jejunum on day 2. In conclusion, nutritional treatment with the IMF alleviated the adverse effects induced by 5-FU injection in rats."
