GFP is a stable protein; this property allows its accumulation and easy detection in cells. However, this stability also limits its application in studies that require rapid reporter turnover. We created a destabilized GFP for use in such studies by fusing amino acids 422–461 of the degradation domain of mouse ornithine decarboxylase (MODC) to the C-terminal end of an enhanced variant of GFP (EGFP). The fusion protein, unlike EGFP, was unstable in the presence of cycloheximide and had a fluorescence half-life of 2 h. Western blot analysis indicated that the fluorescence decay of EGFP-MODC-(422–461) was correlated with degradation of the fusion protein. We mutated key amino acids in the PEST sequence of EGFP-MODC-(422–461) and identified several mutants with variable half-lives. The suitability of destabilized EGFP as a transcription reporter was tested by linking it to NFκB binding sequences and monitoring tumor necrosis factor α-mediated NFκB activation. We obtained time course induction and dose response kinetics similar to secreted alkaline phosphatase obtained in transfected cells. This result did not occur when unmodified EGFP was used as the reporter. Because of its autofluorescence, destabilized EGFP can be used to directly correlate gene induction with biochemical change, such as NFκB translocation to the nucleus.

GFP fluorescence does not require any substrate or cofactor (5Heim R. Prasher D.C. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U . S . A. 1994; 91: 12501-12504Crossref PubMed Scopus (1476) Google Scholar); hence it is possible to use it in many species for live cell detection purposes. The fluorescence of GFPs is dependent on the key sequence Ser-Tyr-Gly (amino acids 65–67). This sequence undergoes spontaneous oxidation to form a cyclized chromophore (6Inouge S. Tsuji F.I. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Enhanced GFP (EGFP) contains mutations of Ser to Thr at amino acid 65 and Phe to Leu at position 64 and is encoded by a gene with human-optimized codons (7Cormack B.P. Valdivia R.H. Falkow S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 173: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (2489) Google Scholar, 8Haas J. Park E.C. Seed B. Curr.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4592-4593Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Crystallographic structures of wild-type GFP and the mutant S65T reveal that the GFP tertiary structure resembles a barrel (10Ormo M. Cubitt A.B. Kallio K. Gross L.A. Tsien R.Y. Remington S.J. Science. 1996; 273: 1392-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1902) Google Scholar,11Yang F. Moss L.G. Phillips Jr., G.N. Nature Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1246-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). GFP is a single chain polypeptide of 238 amino acids (12Prasher D.C. Eckenrode V.K. Ward W.W. Prendergast F.G. Cormier M.J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 111: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). Most of these amino acids form β sheets that are compacted through an antiparallel structure to form the barrel. An α-helix containing the chromophore is located inside the barrel, which shields it from the external environment. The compact structure makes GFP very stable under a variety of conditions, including treatment with protease (1Chalfie M. Euskirchen G. Ward W.W. Prasher D.C. Science. 1994; 263: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (5451) Google Scholar). The stability of GFP limits its application in some studies, including transcriptional induction studies.Cellular proteins differ widely in their stabilities. Rapid turnover in proteins is often caused by signals that induce protein degradation. In some cases, the signal is a primary sequence such as the PEST sequence, a sequence possibly correlated with protein degradation (13Rogers S.R. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar, 14Ghoda L. Van Daalen Wetters T. Macrase M. Ascherman D. Coffino P. Science. 1989; 243: 1493-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In other cases, the signal is a modification such as phosphorylation (15Papavassiliou A.G. Treier M. Chavrier C. Bohmann D. Science. 1992; 258: 1941-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) or a protein-protein interaction (16Scheffner M. Werness B.A. Huibregtse J.M. Levine A.J. Howley P.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 1129-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3429) Google Scholar, 17Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3556-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Prior to degradation, most short lived proteins need ubiquitin modification, which is catalyzed by a number of ubiquitin modification enzymes (18Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. Nature. 1992; 357: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 19Gottesman S. Maurizi M.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 592-621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu.

Only these ubiquitinated proteins are recognized and degraded by a 26 S proteasome.A few proteins do not require ubiquitin modification for degradation. One such protein is mouse ornithine decarboxylase (MODC) (22Bercovich Z. Rosenberg-Hasson Y. Ciechanover A. Kahana C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15949-15952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Rosenberg-Hasson Y. Bercovich Z. Ciechanover A. Kahana C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 24Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Kameji T. Hayashi S. Igarashi K. Tamura T. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Nature. 1992; 360: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). MODC is the key enzyme in the biosynthesis of polyamines. This protein is known to be one of the most short lived proteins in mammalian cells, and its half-life is approximately 30 min. In contrast, ornithine decarboxylase of Trypanosoma brucei is quite stable when expressed in mammalian cells (25Ghoda L. Phillips M.A. Bass K.E. Wang C.C. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11823-11826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of the primary sequences of these two proteins shows over 60% homology (26Phillips M.A. Coffino P. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8721-8727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, MODC has extra sequences at its C terminus that are not needed for ornithine decarboxylase activity (14Ghoda L. Van Daalen Wetters T. Macrase M. Ascherman D. Coffino P. Science. 1989; 243: 1493-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). This C terminus contains a PEST sequence, and its deletion from MODC prevents its rapid degradation (14Ghoda L. Van Daalen Wetters T. Macrase M. Ascherman D. Coffino P. Science. 1989; 243: 1493-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the C-terminal extension is also sufficient for inducing degradation of T. brucei ornithine decarboxylase in vivo, which becomes unstable after fusion with the region (25Ghoda L. Phillips M.A. Bass K.E. Wang C.C. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11823-11826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, this region functions as the “degradation domain” of MODC.The hypothesis that PEST sequences correlate with protein degradation is based on a computer search among short lived proteins (13Rogers S.R. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar, 27Rechsteiner M. Semin. Cell Biol. 1990; 1: 433-440PubMed Google Scholar). Most short lived proteins contain a region enriched with Pro, Glu, Ser, and Thr. This region is often flanked by basic amino acids, Lys, Arg, or His. The role of the PEST sequence in protein degradation has subsequently been demonstrated in several short lived proteins, such as that at the C terminus of mouse ornithine decarboxylase.In this study, we fused the degradation domain of mouse ornithine decarboxylase to the C terminus of EGFP. The degradation domain of MODC dramatically decreased the half-life of EGFP in mammalian cells to 2 h. We mutated key amino acids in the PEST sequence of the fusion protein and identified several mutants with different half-lives. Furthermore, linkage of the fusion protein to the binding sequences of the transcription factor NFκB allowed detection of TNFα-mediated NFκB induction in HEK293 cells. The use of destabilized EGFP (dEGFP) as a transcription reporter makes gene induction study possible in real time with living cells. The correlation of induction with the other biochemical changes such as nuclear translocation was also possible.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESThe cDNAs encoding EGFP and the C terminus of MODC were amplified with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, Inc., La Jolla, CA). EGFP was amplified with primers that incorporated aSacII recognition sequence at the 5′ end and aHindIII sequence at the 3′ end. The stop codon of EGFP was deleted to make a continuous open reading frame with the C terminus of MODC. The C terminus of MODC was amplified with primers that incorporated a HindIII recognition sequence at the 5′ end and an EcoRI sequence at the 3′ end. The amplified polymerase chain reaction products were ligated at theHindIII site, and the fusion was cloned into the pTRE expression vector for use in the tetracycline (Tc)-regulated expression system (28Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4227) Google Scholar). Using this strategy, we made EGFP-MODC-(422–461) and its mutants. Key amino acids of the PEST sequence in the fusion protein were mutated to Ala. The mutants were made using a homology extension procedure (33Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Peasse L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2629) Google Scholar). The mutations include P426A/P427A, P438A, E428A/E430A/E431A, E444A, S440A, S445A, T436A, D433A/D434A, D448A, P426A/P427A, and P438A.The construct DNAs were purified with Qiagen columns and transfected into CHO K1 Tet-off cells (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) for degradation studies. CHO K1 Tet-off cells stably express a fusion protein of the tet repressor and the herpes simplex virus VP16 (tetracycline-controlled transactivator) and thus can be used for Tc-regulated expression of genes cloned into the pTRE vector (28Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4227) Google Scholar) (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.). Tetracycline-controlled transactivator initiates transcription by binding to a modified cytomegalovirus promoter with Tet repressor binding elements in the pTRE vector. This binding can be blocked by Tc, and hence the expression can be controlled by the level of Tc in the medium. These DNAs were introduced into these cells using CLONfectin (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.). After 24 h, transfected cells were subject to functional analyses as described below.To examine the fluorescence intensity of EGFP or EGFP-MODC-(422–461), the cells were cultured on coverslips. After transfection, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. The coverslips were mounted on a glass slide and examined under a Zeiss Axioskop model 50 fluorescence microscope. To determine protein turnover, the cells were treated with cycloheximide (CHX) at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml for varying times before paraformaldehyde fixation.The transfected cells with or without CHX treatment were collected by EDTA treatment, and the cell pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS. The cell suspensions were then analyzed for fluorescence intensity using a FACS calibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Inc., San Jose, CA). EGFP was excited at 488 nm, and emission was detected using a 510/20 bandpass filter.The transfected cells with or without CHX treatment were collected in PBS, and cell lysates were prepared by sonication. Proteins were separated by SDS gel electrophoresis, transferred onto a membrane, and EGFP and EGFP-MODC fusion proteins were detected using a monoclonal antibody against GFP (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.). The detection was visualized with the Western Exposure chemiluminescent detection kit (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.).To make a TNFα-responding vector, 4 copies of NFκB binding sequence were cloned into the pSEAP2 vector with the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter, making pNFκB-SEAP. The SEAP gene was then replaced with the EGFP or dEGFP (EGFP-MODC-(422–461)) gene, making pNFκB-EGFP and pNFκB-dEGFP. These constructs were transfected into HEK293 cells. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were treated with 0.1 μg/ml recombinant human TNFα. The medium or the cells were collected for SEAP assaying (CLONTECHLaboratories, Inc.) or flow cytometric analysis.To examine both NFκB translocation and NFκB-mediated induction of dEGFP, 293 cells were transfected with pNFκB-dEGFP. After TNF treatment, the transfected cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) for 30 min at room temperature and rinsed with PBS three times. The fixed cells were then permeabilized with a blocking solution consisting of 4% bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h. The cells were incubated with 1:250 diluted polyclonal antibodies against NFκB p65 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) in blocking solution for 2 h. After washing with PBS three times, the cells were incubated with 1:250 diluted rhodamine-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Boehringer Mannheim) for 45 min in PBS containing 4% bovine serum albumin. After rinsing three times with PBS, the stained cells were mounted in Citifluor (Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA).RESULTSThe C terminus of MODC, containing amino acids 422–461, inducesT. brucei ornithine decarboxylase degradation in mammalian cells (31Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2377-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This fragment contains a PEST sequence at amino acids 423–449. To determine whether the PEST domain can also induce EGFP degradation, we appended it to the C-terminal end of EGFP to make EGFP-MODC-(422–461). This fusion construct was expressed from a Tc-regulated expression vector, pTRE. The fluorescence intensity of the fusion protein was examined under a fluorescence microscope after it was transiently expressed in CHO K1 Tet-off cells. Fig.1 shows that the fluorescence intensity of EGFP-MODC-(422–461) is similar to EGFP with no difference in the intracellular distribution.Next, we tested the ability of the C terminus of MODC to induce EGFP degradation in vivo. The construct was first transiently transfected into CHO K1 Tet-off cells. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were treated with 100 μg/ml CHX for 0, 1, 2, and 3 h, and the change in fluorescence intensity of the transfected cells was examined by fluorescence microscopy. The fluorescence intensity of the fusion protein in the cells gradually decreased as CHX treatment was extended (Fig. 1) indicating that the fusion protein is unstable. After a 3-h treatment with CHX, fluorescence intensity had decreased by more than 50%. The results suggest that the half-life of the fusion protein is less than 3 h. In contrast, we did not observe a significant change in the fluorescence intensity in the EGFP-transfected cells (Fig. 1). To determine the half-life of the EGFP-MODC fusion protein more accurately, we used flow cytometry to measure the change in fluorescence of cells expressing the fusion protein. Half of the untreated cells maintained fluorescence after a 2-h treatment (Fig.2). Therefore, we conclude that the half-life of the fusion protein is 2 h. EGFP-transfected cells still had more than 90% of fluorescence relative to untreated cells during the treatment.Figure 2A, flow cytometric analysis of the fluorescence stabilities of EGFP and EGFP-MODC-(422–461). CHO K1 Tet-off cells were transfected with the two constructs used in Fig. 1. After 24 h, the transfected cells were treated with 100 μg/ml CHX for 0, 1, 2, and 3 h. The treated cells were collected with EDTA, and 10,000 cells were subjected to FACS analysis. B, the percentage of the fluorescent cells was plotted. Solid circles, EGFP; open circles, EGFP-MODC-(422–461).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To examine the correlation between the half-life of the EGFP fusion protein and its fluorescence, the EGFP and EGFP-MODC-(422–461) transfected cells used for flow cytometry were also used for Western blot analysis with a monoclonal antibody against GFP. As shown in Fig.3, the antibody was able to detect EGFP and the fusion protein. No detectable change in the level of EGFP was found. However, the EGFP-MODC-(422–461) fusion protein at 31 kDa was unstable, as measured by a decline following CHX treatment. Half of the fusion protein was degraded within 2 h of CHX treatment. We conclude that the half-life of the EGFP-MODC-(422–461) fusion protein is approximately 1–2 h. Our results indicate that the fluorescence decay of the fusion protein correlates with its protein degradation. The fusion protein was designated dEGFP.Figure 3Western blot analysis of protein stabilities of EGFP and EGFP-MODC-(422–461). Cells collected during flow cytometry were used for preparing cell lysates. The cell lysates were subject to SDS gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a membrane. EGFP and the EGFP fusion protein were detected with a monoclonal antibody against GFP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To evaluate the contribution of PEST amino acids to protein degradation in dEGFP, we mutated Pro, Glu, Ser, and Thr residues of dEGFP, as well as the flanking basic amino acid residues, to Ala. Next, we monitored degradation by the change in fluorescence intensity (Fig.4). The data for these EGFP-MODC fusion mutants are shown in Table I. We found that the degradation rate was not proportional to the number of PEST residues but was determined by their positions, such as the Glu mutations. Mutation of the Glu residue at amino acid 444 stabilized the protein, but mutation of the Glu residues at amino acids 428, 430, and 431 shortened the half-life; only 20% of the cells fluoresced 2 h after treatment. These results suggested that the Pro, Glu, Ser, and Thr residues of the PEST sequence contribute to protein instability in varying ways.Figure 4Schematic map of the PEST sequence of EGFP-MODC-(422–461) and the position of the mutations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table IFACS analysis of EGFP, EGFP-MODC-(422–461), and mutations in transfected CHO K1 Tet-off cellsConstructs0 hInitial2 h4 h%%%EGFP100(63.6)10792EGFP-MODC-(422–461)100(12.6)5229P426A/P427A100(11.5)3911P438A100(34.1)7960E428A/E430A/E431A100(17.3)2015E444A100(12.6)6965S440A100(21.6)7866S445A100(23.5)2920T436A100(46.9)7047D433A/D434A100(11.31)226D448A100(32.6)3015H423A100(12.2)5025R449A/H450A100(27.9)9386Transfection was performed in CHO/tTA cells using the procedure as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After 24 h, cells were treated with CHX for 0, 2, and 4 h and analyzed for fluorescence intensity by FACS caliber (Becton Dickinson). The fluorescent cells at each time point are represented as a percentage of initial. Open table in a new tab To determine whether dEGFP can be used as a transcription reporter, we linked it to 4 copies of NFκB binding sequence and the constitutive thymidine kinase promoter. The construct was transiently transfected into HeLa cells for monitoring TNFα-mediated NFκB activation (Fig.5). The time course induction with kinetics is similar to SEAP, another commonly used genetic reporter. Induction of both SEAP and dEGFP occurred after 2 h, was maximized at 6 h, and declined after that. The results demonstrate that dEGFP can be used as a reporter to monitor transcription induction. In contrast, unmodified EGFP, when used as the reporter for induction, did not respond well to TNFα during the treatment. This result might be because of a higher basal level of the stable protein accumulating in the cells. Therefore, unlike dEGFP, which has a rapid turnover, stable EGFP cannot be used as a reporter for the study of transcriptional induction.Figure 5TNFα-mediated NFκB activation.HEK293 cells were transfected by the reporter constructs, pNFκB-SEAP, pNFκB-EGFP, or pNFκB-dEGFP. 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated either with 0.1 μg/ml human TNFα. The cells were collected for SEAP assay (A) or flow cytometry analysis (B) or with different doses of TNFα (C). Normalized fluorescence intensity was presented.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)dEGFP, like EGFP, is an autofluorescent protein whose emission does not require any cofactors or substrates. As a result, we were able to use it to examine the correlation between TNFα-mediated transcription induction and NFκB translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Sixteen hours after transfection with pNFκB-dEGFP, HEK293 cells were treated with TNFα for 0, 0.5, 2, and 6 h and stained with polyclonal antibodies against NFκB p65 and then with a rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody. As shown in Fig.6, transcriptional induction was monitored with dEGFP (green) and the translocation process of NFκB with rhodamine (red). NFκB was located in the cytoplasm of HEK293 cells before TNFα treatment. TNFα induced rapid translocation of NFκB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. This process was nearly complete after 30 min, but dEGFP was not detected during this period. After 2 h, NFκB had accumulated in the nucleus, and the induction of dEGFP lessened. NFκB relocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and the induction of dEGFP was highest after 6 h. The results demonstrate that the translocation of NFκB is transient in response to TNFα and that all of the translocated NFκB was recruited back to the cytoplasm after 6 h. This transient translocation of NFκB resulted in its transient activity in the mediation of transcription induction of dEGFP or SEAP.Figure 6Simultaneous detection of NFκB localization and NFκB-mediated induction of dEGFP. HEK293 cells were transfected by pNFκB-dEGFP. 16 h after transfection, the cells were treated with TNF for 0, 0.5, 2, and 6 h. NFκB translocation was examined with antibodies against p65 and rhodamine-labeled IgG (A). NFκB-mediated induction was determined by dEGFP (B). NFκB translocation and induction of dEGFP were detected simultaneously (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONWe destabilized EGFP by appending the degradation domain of MODC to the C terminus of EGFP. The fusion protein is unstable in the presence of CHX. Analysis with flow cytometry indicated that the half-life of dEGFP is approximately 2 h. Western blot analysis indicated that the half-life was 1–2 h. The difference in the half-life by two different methods may have been because of the presence of nonfluorescent premature and mature GFP. Maturation of the EGFP chromophore is post-translational and proceeds with a half-time of about 25 min (7Cormack B.P. Valdivia R.H. Falkow S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 173: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (2489) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurement detects solely mature GFP, but Western blotting detects both premature and mature GFP. Thus, the two methods will result in different half-life determinations. Because we wish to use GFP as a reporter at the fluorescence level rather than at the protein level, its fluorescence half-life is a more important quality. We conclude that the half-life of dEGFP is 2 h.The C terminus of MODC that induces EGFP degradation in vivocontains a PEST sequence from amino acids 423 to 449. Of these 26 amino acids, 10 are Pro, Glu, Ser, and Thr and 3 are Asp. Mutation analysis indicates at least 1 Pro, Glu, Ser, and Thr is required for protein degradation. However, we found that degradation does not correlate with the number of PEST residues. Some mutants were even more unstable, such as mutant S445A. This resulted in a conflict with those observed in the study of yeast uracil permease where instability is correlated to the total number of Ser residues in the PEST-like sequence (33Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Peasse L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2629) Google Scholar). Therefore, the PEST hypothesis needs more validation probably by determining the contributions of PEST sequences of different short lived proteins to protein degradation. Because it is easily detected, EGFP is an excellent reporter for studies of protein degradation.The rapid turnover of dEGFP provides at least three advantages over EGFP. First, the rapid turnover of dEGFP allows its application studies requiring destabilized GFP, such as circadian rhythms studies (32Abrams S.B. Circadian Rhythms Aren't All in the Head. Biophotonics International, Pittsfield, MA1998: 24-25Google Scholar). Second, its rapid turnover results in less accumulation in cells leading to lower toxicity in the cells when stably expressed. Thus, we believe that establishing a stable cell line using this genetic fusion in place of unmodified EGFP will be easier. Finally, the destabilized version of EGFP can be used as a transient reporter in the study of cis-acting regulatory elements or transcriptional induction.We compared the utility of dEGFP as a transcription reporter to that of EGFP. To do so, we monitored TNFα-mediated NFκB activation. The kinetics of time course induction of dEGFP and dose response were similar to those of SEAP; the kinetics of EGFP were not. The likely explanation for the phenomenon is that because of its slow turnover, EGFP is easily accumulated even under noninduced basal level expression, which narrows the range of induction. Therefore, the induction of EGFP is much slower than that of dEGFP. In contrast, the rapid turnover of dEGFP prevents its accumulation and, following TNFα treatment, results in time course induction similar to SEAP. dEGFP was also able to show the induction of other cis-acting elements stimulated by cAMP, dexamethasone, etc. (data not shown). These results indicate that dEGFP is of general utility as a transcription reporter. Because dEGFP fluorescence can be detected in real time without the addition of any substrates or cofactors, it has an obvious advantage in cell-based assays over the other reporters, such as SEAP, firefly luciferase, or β-galactosidase.

https://openalex.org/W2157817725,"Previous studies have shown that the rate of fatty acid synthesis is elevated by more than 20-fold in livers of transgenic mice that express truncated nuclear forms of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). This was explained in part by an increase in the levels of mRNA for the two major enzymes of fatty acid synthesis, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase, whose transcription is stimulated by SREBPs. Fatty acid synthesis also requires a source of acetyl-CoA and NADPH. In the current studies we show that the levels of mRNA for ATP citrate lyase, the enzyme that produces acetyl-CoA, are also elevated in the transgenic livers. In addition, we found marked elevations in the mRNAs for malic enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, all of which produce NADPH. Finally, we found that overexpressing two of the SREBPs (1a and 2) led to elevated mRNAs for stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), an isoform that is detectable in nontransgenic livers, and SCD2, an isoform that is not detected in nontransgenic livers. This stimulation led to an increase in total SCD activity in liver microsomes. Together, all of these changes would be expected to lead to a marked increase in the concentration of monounsaturated fatty acids in the transgenic livers, and this was confirmed chromatographically. We conclude that expression of nuclear SREBPs is capable of activating the entire coordinated program of unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis in mouse liver.

Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) 1The abbreviations used are: SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; FAS, fatty acid synthase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GPAT, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase; Glu-6-PD, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; HMG-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein; PGDH, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase; SCD, stearoyl-CoA desaturase. are a family of transcription factors that regulate the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and multiple enzymes required for the biosynthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids (see Ref. 1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar for review). SREBPs belong to the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper family of transcription factors. Unlike other members of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine-Zip family, SREBPs are synthesized as ∼1150 amino acid precursors bound to the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope. The membrane-bound precursor must undergo a sequential two-step cleavage process to release the transcriptionally active NH2-terminal portion of the protein (2Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Once cleaved, the ∼500 amino acid NH2-terminal nuclear form enters the nucleus and activates transcription by binding to promoter regions of genes containing non-palindromic sterol regulatory elements as well as palindromic sequences called E-boxes (1Brown M.S.

Genes involved in cholesterol metabolism that are directly activated by SREBPs include the LDL receptor, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) synthase, HMG-CoA reductase, farnesyl diphosphate synthase, squalene synthase, and SREBP-2 (1Brown M.S.

Genes involved in fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT), are also directly activated by SREBPs (9Magaña M.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7298-7305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). To date, three isoforms of SREBP have been identified and characterized (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar). The human versions of all three isoforms were originally discovered as transcription factors that bound non-palindromic sterol regulatory elements and regulated cholesterol metabolism. Two of these, designated SREBP-1a, and -1c, are derived from the same gene through use of alternative transcription start sites resulting in proteins that produce different first exons (12Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A. Wu J. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). The rat homologue of human SREBP-1c (adipocyte determination differentiation-dependent factor 1) was originally cloned as a transcription factor that bound to E-box sequences and promoted adipocyte differentiation (13Tontonoz P. Kim J.B. Graves R.A. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4753-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). The third isoform, SREBP-2, is derived from a second gene (14Hua X. Yokoyama C. Wu J. Briggs M.R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11603-11607Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). All actively growing cultured cells studied to date produce predominantly the SREBP-1a and SREBP-2 isoforms (15Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). However, in most organs from adult animals, SREBP-1c and SREBP-2 are predominant (15Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). When sterols build up in cells, the proteolytic release of SREBPs from membranes is inhibited and transcription of all target genes declines (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar). To gain insight into separate roles of each SREBP isoform in vivo, we previously produced and characterized transgenic mice that overexpress truncated, transcriptionally active nuclear forms of human SREBP-1a, -1c, or -2 in liver (16Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 17Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 18Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Shimano H. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2331-2339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transgenes encode versions of the proteins that terminate prior to the membrane attachment domain. Consequently, these proteins enter the nucleus directly without a requirement for proteolysis. Mice that overexpressed the truncated SREBP-1a isoform (TgSREBP-1a) had dramatically enlarged livers that were engorged with cholesterol as well as triglycerides. The rates of hepatic cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis were increased by 5- and 25-fold, respectively, as measured by the incorporation of [3H]water. Corresponding 5-fold increases were measured in the liver mRNAs for HMG-CoA synthase, squalene synthase, and the LDL receptor while 20–25-fold increases were measured in ACC and FAS (16Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). In contrast, mice that overexpressed the nuclear form of human SREBP-1c (TgSREBP-1c) had no increase in hepatic cholesterol synthesis, but had a 4-fold increase in fatty acid synthesis. In agreement with the synthesis studies, no increases were measured in mRNAs for cholesterol synthetic enzymes, but 2- and 4-fold increases were measured in ACC and FAS, respectively (17Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). SREBP-2 transgenic mice (TgSREBP-2) had elevated hepatic cholesterol accumulations like those measured in livers from TgSREBP-1a mice, but significantly less triglyceride accumulation. The livers from TgSREBP-2 mice had 28-fold higher rates of cholesterol synthesis, but only 4-fold higher rates of fatty acid synthesis. The mRNAs for the cholesterol synthetic enzymes, HMG-CoA synthase, farnesyl diphosphate synthase, and squalene synthase were increased by 10–12-fold. The mRNAs for the fatty acid synthetic enzymes ACC and FAS were increased 7- and 15-fold, respectively. Therefore, the SREBP-1 isoforms seem more selective in activating genes involved in fatty acid synthesis while SREBP-2 is more specific for activating genes involved in cholesterol synthesis (18Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Shimano H. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2331-2339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism for the relative specificity of each transcription factor is currently not known. All three lines of transgenic mice had 3–4-fold increases in the hepatic mRNA for the fatty acid modifying enzyme, stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD). SCD is a microsomal enzyme that introduces a cis-double bond in the Δ9 position of saturated fatty acids, resulting in the production of monounsaturated fatty acids (19Ntambi J.M. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The preferred substrates for SCD are palmitoyl (16:0) and stearoyl (18:0) CoA which are converted to palmitoleoyl (16:1) and oleoyl (18:1) CoA, respectively. Two isoforms of SCD, SCD1 and SCD2, are currently known (20Ntambi J.M. Buhrow S.A. Kaestner K.H. Christy R.J. Sibley E. Kelly Jr., T.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17291-17300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kaestner K.H. Ntambi J.M. Kelly Jr., T.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14755-14761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most organs produce both SCD1 and SCD2. The notable exception is liver, which expresses only the SCD1 isoform (21Kaestner K.H. Ntambi J.M. Kelly Jr., T.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14755-14761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of SCD is of considerable physiologic importance since this enzyme ultimately determines the ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fatty acids in the cell. Alterations in this ratio can change membrane fluidity. Such alterations have been implicated in various disease processes, including cancer, diabetes, obesity, and vascular disease (19Ntambi J.M. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Several crucial questions regarding the role of SREBPs in fatty acid metabolism remain unanswered: 1) SREBPs markedly enhance the utilization of acetyl-CoA for lipid synthesis, but do they activate transcription of genes encoding enzymes that synthesize acetyl-CoA? 2) Do SREBPs increase the mRNAs encoding enzymes that supply the other substrate for fatty acid synthesis, i.e. NADPH? 3) Which isoform of SCD is elevated by SREBP overexpression? 4) Does the contribution of fatty acid overproduction and SCD enhancement lead to a predominance of unsaturated fatty acids in the transgenic livers? 5) Are there relative differences among the SREBP isoforms in eliciting these effects? The current studies were designed to answer these questions. All restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) and DNA manipulations were performed using standard molecular biology techniques (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Redivue[α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Corp. Oleic acid [9,10-3H]- and [1-14C]stearoyl-CoA were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Stearic acid, oleic acid, and silica gel plates were purchased from Alltech (Deerfield, IL), stearoyl-CoA from Fluka (Ronkonkoma, NY), and silver nitrate from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). All other chemicals used were from Sigma. The content of cholesterol and triglycerides in plasma and liver was measured as described previously (16Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Transgene constructs encoding amino acids 1–460 of human SREBP-1a, 1–436 of human SREBP-1c, and 1–468 of human SREBP-2 under the control of the rat phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase promoter were described previously (16Shimano H.

In Experiment A, 6 male TgSREBP-1a (line B) (16Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar) and 6 male nontransgenic wild-type littermate mice were studied. Experiment B included 5 male TgSREBP-1c (17Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar), 5 male TgSREBP-2 (line B) (18Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Shimano H. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2331-2339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) mice, and 5 male wild-type control mice. The TgSREBP-2 mice studied were offspring of mice homozygous for the SREBP-2 transgene. Therefore, all of the wild-type mice in Experiment B were derived from TgSREBP-1c nontransgenic littermates. All mice were housed in colony cages in a 14-h light/10-h dark cycle and were maintained on Teklad 6% (w/w) Mouse/Rat Diet 7002 from Harlan Teklad Premier Laboratory Diets (Madison, WI). Four weeks prior to sacrifice, transgenic and littermate controls were placed on a low carbohydrate/high protein diet (number 5789C-3) from Purina Mills Inc. (St. Louis, MO) containing 71% (w/w) casein and 4.25% (w/w) sucrose. This diet induces the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase promoter resulting in maximal transgene expression. All mice were sacrificed at 34–36 weeks of age, during the early phase of the light cycle, and in the non-fasted state. Total RNA was prepared from mouse liver using RNeasyTM RNA kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). For Northern gel analysis, equal aliquots of total RNA were pooled (total, 15 μg), denatured with formaldehyde and formamide, subjected to electrophoresis in a 1% formaldehyde agarose gel, and transferred to Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham) for hybridization. cDNA probes for ATP citrate lyase, malic enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Glu-6-PD), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGDH), glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT), and S14 were prepared by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using mouse liver poly(A)+ RNA as a template as described previously (16Shimano H.

The bands detected by Northern analysis were quantified by exposing the filter to a BAS1000 Fuji PhosphorImager (Tokyo, Japan), and the results were normalized to the signal generated by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA. cRNA probes and protection assay conditions for comparison of transgene expression in livers of SREBP-1a, -1c, and -2 mice were prepared as described previously (18Horton J.D.

The specific activities of the cRNAs were 0.9–1.4 × 109 cpm/μg for SCD1 and SCD2 and 1.1–1.6 × 109 cpm/μg for β-actin. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity was measured in liver microsomes that were prepared by homogenizing ∼100 mg of liver in 0.5 ml of a 0.1 mpotassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min and the resultant supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The microsomal pellet was resuspended in a 0.1m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) (29Raju P.K. Reiser R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 280: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).

The reaction mixture for the stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity included the following: 60 μm [1-14C]stearoyl-CoA, 2 mm NADH in 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2), 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.2), and 100 μg of microsomal protein in a final volume of 100 μl (31St. John L.C.

Acta. 1966; 128: 13-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Radioactivity was determined using a liquid scintillation spectrometer. The enzyme activity is expressed as nanomole·min−1·mg protein−1. Total lipids were extracted from 300–350-mg aliquots of liver and esterified cholesterol, triglycerides, and total phospholipids were separated on 500-mg silica columns (Varian catalog number 1211-3036) exactly as described (35Hamilton J.G. Comai K. Lipids. 1988; 23: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). After saponification, the fatty acids in each of these samples were methyl esterified and the relative abundance of each fatty acid was quantified by gas-liquid chromatography (36Lepage G. Roy C.C.

Experiment A included mice overexpressing the nuclear form of human SREBP-1a and their wild-type littermates, while Experiment B included mice that overexpress the nuclear form of human SREBP-1c or SREBP-2. Wild-type littermates from the TgSREBP-1c mice were used as controls in Experiment B. The changes in plasma and liver lipid levels between wild-type and transgenic mice are consistent with previously published results (16Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S.

Both levels were ∼30-fold higher than those measured in control livers. SREBP-1c overexpression resulted in very little change in the cholesteryl ester concentration but it did increase the triglyceride concentration to 36 mg/g. TgSREBP-2 mouse livers had an elevated mean cholesteryl ester concentration of 3.1 mg/g and a triglyceride content of 38 mg/g.Table IPhenotypic comparison of wild-type and transgenic miceParameterGenotype of mice6 malesWild-typeTgSREBP-1aExperiment ABody weight (g)29.7 ± 0.832.7 ± 1.1Liver weight (g)1.44 ± 0.065.89 ± 0.33ap < 0.001 between wild-type and transgenic mice (Student's t test).Liver cholesterol content (mg/g)2.44 ± 0.112.0 ± 1.2ap < 0.001 between wild-type and transgenic mice (Student's t test).Liver esterified cholesterol content (mg/g)0.30 ± 0.049.9 ± 0.89ap < 0.001 between wild-type and transgenic mice (Student's t test).Liver triglyceride content (mg/g)6.22 ± 0.8183 ± 11ap < 0.001 between wild-type and transgenic mice (Student's t test).Total plasma cholesterol (mg/dl)95 ± 5.440 ± 4.6ap < 0.001 between wild-type and transgenic mice (Student's t test).Total plasma triglyceride (mg/dl)205 ± 1977 ± 12ap < 0.001 between wild-type and transgenic mice (Student's t test).5 malesWild-typeTgSREBP-1cTgSREBP-2Experiment BBody weight (g)30.0 ± 0.831.0 ± 0.928.4 ± 0.7Liver weight (g)1.52 ± 0.081.59 ± 0.081.66 ± 0.09Liver cholesterol content (mg/g)2.28 ± 0.12.96 ± 0.1ap < 0.001 between wild-type and transgenic mice (Student's t test).5.76 ± 0.3ap < 0.001 between wild-type and transgenic mice (Student's t test).Liver esterified cholesterol content (mg/g)0.1 ± 0.010.55 ± 0.09bp < 0.01 between wild-type and transgenic mice (Student's t test).3.1 ± 0.06ap < 0.001 between wild-type and transgenic mice (Student's t test).Liver triglyceride content (mg/g)5.17 ± 0.136.1 ± 6.3bp < 0.01 between wild-type and transgenic mice (Student's t test).37.9 ± 6.8bp < 0.01 between wild-type and transgenic mice (Student's t test).Total plasma cholesterol (mg/dl)100 ± 5.7123 ± 5.7105 ± 4.3Total plasma triglycerides (mg/dl)158 ± 11108 ± 1474.2 ± 7.7ap < 0.001 between wild-type and transgenic mice (Student's t test).Each value represents the mean ± S.E.

This mammalian enzyme is composed of a catalytic α subunit and noncatalytic β and γ subunits and is a member of a larger protein kinase family that includes the SNF1 kinase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the present study, we have identified by truncation and site-directed mutagenesis several functional domains of the α1 catalytic subunit, which modulate its activity, subunit association, and protein turnover. C-terminal truncation of the 548-amino acid (aa) wild-type α1 protein to aa 312 or 392 abolishes the binding of the β/γ subunits and dramatically increases protein expression. The full-length wild-type α1 subunit is only minimally active in the absence of co-expressed β/γ, and α1(1–392) likewise has little activity. Further truncation to aa 312, however, is associated with a large increase in enzyme specific activity, thus revealing an autoinhibitory sequence between aa 313 and 392. α-1(1–312) still requires the phosphorylation of the activation loop Thr-172 for enzyme activity, yet is now independent of the allosteric activator, AMP. The increased levels of protein expression on transient transfection of either truncated α subunit cDNA are because of a decrease in enzyme turnover by pulse-chase analysis. Taken together, these data indicate that the α1 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase contains several features that determine enzyme activity and stability. A constitutively active form of the kinase that does not require participation by the noncatalytic subunits provides a unique reagent for exploring the functions of AMP-activated protein kinase.

Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). Another important substrate of AMPK is acetyl-CoA carboxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid synthesis (1Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of either hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase or acetyl-CoA carboxylase by AMPK results in their inactivation. Other metabolic enzymes that are substrates of AMPK include hormone-sensitive lipase, glycogen synthase, and creatine kinase (1Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar, 2Poniticos M. Lu Q.L. Morgan J.E. Hardie D.G. Partridge T.A. Carling D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1688-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Recently, Raf-1 was shown to be an AMPK substrate, but the significance of this phosphorylation event has not been established (3Sprenkle A.B. Davies S.P. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Sturgill T.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Phylogenetically, members of the AMPK family are widely distributed with homologs found in such nonmammalian organisms as rye, barley, tobacco, cauliflower, yeast, Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis elegans.

AMPK is a metabolic sensor/effector and becomes activated under such conditions as nutrient starvation, hypoxia, exercise, and heat shock (1Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). Activation of AMPK is because of the rise in the cellular concentration of 5′-AMP, its allosteric activator, that accompanies these stressful conditions. The binding of AMP also facilitates the phosphorylation of AMPK by its upstream activator, AMPK kinase and inhibits its dephosphorylation and inactivation by protein phosphatase 2C (7Davies S.P. Helps N.R. Cohen P.T.W. Hardie D.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). AMPK is a heterotrimeric, serine/threonine protein kinase. Multiple isoforms of the catalytic (α (α1, α2)) and noncatalytic (β (β1, β2, β3); γ (γ1, γ2, γ3)) subunits have been identified (1Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J.

Snf1p, the Sip1p/Sip2p/Gal83p family, and Snf4p are the yeast homologs of the mammalian AMPK α, β, and γ subunits, respectively (6Gao G. Widmer J. Stapleton D. Teh T. Cox T. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A.

Comparison of AMPKα and Snf1p catalytic subunits shows that, within the kinase catalytic domain, the proteins are 67% identical (6Gao G. Widmer J. Stapleton D. Teh T. Cox T. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1266: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid analysis was used to localize regions in the Snf1p C terminus that bind Snf4p and Sip1p/Sip2p/Gal83p (14Jiang R. Carlson M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3105-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 15Jiang R. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2099-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 16Yang X. Jiang R. Carlson M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5878-5886Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The C terminus of the α subunit of AMPK has also been identified as the region responsible for binding β and γ subunits (13Dyck J.R.B. Gao G. Widmer J. Stapleton D. Fernandez C.S. Kemp B. Witters L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17798-17803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Regulation of the Snf1p protein kinase activity occurs through modulation of binding by Snf4p and is directed by varying nutrient availability. Under conditions of low glucose, a conformational change occurs in Snf4p, thereby releasing a Snf1p subunit regulatory domain from its tonic inhibition of the kinase catalytic domain (14Jiang R. Carlson M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3105-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In our current studies, we have examined the roles of β and γ subunit binding and of α1 subunit phosphorylation in the regulation of expressed AMPK activity, using truncation and point mutation of the α1 subunit. In doing so, we have identified a constitutively active and longer-lived form of the α1 subunit that no longer has a requirement for the binding of noncatalytic subunits to express activity, although it still requires phosphorylation at Thr-172 for enzyme activation. We have also identified domains in the α1 subunit that regulate the turnover of α1 subunit protein and act as auto-inhibitors of the catalytic domain. Mammalian expression vectors for AMPK subunits (α1, α2, β1, γ1) were the same as previously reported (13Dyck J.R.B. Gao G. Widmer J. Stapleton D. Fernandez C.S. Kemp B. Witters L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17798-17803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The AMPK α1 subunit in pEBG (containing a glutathione-S-transferase epitope tag at the N terminus) was truncated by insertion of a stop codon either after amino acid residue 312 or 392. In addition, a restriction site (AscI) was introduced following the stop codon for ease of diagnostic analysis. Deletion of the C terminus with these truncations renders the α1 subunit 88% identical in amino acid sequence to the same domain of the α2 subunit. Linkers used to create the α1 1–312 and α1 1–392 (termed α1(1–312) and α1(1–392), respectively) truncations were: 5′-GTACTAAGGCGCGCCTTA-3′ and 5′-GTACGATAAGGCGCGCCTTATC-3′, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to modify Thr-172, the site of activating phosphorylation by AMPK kinase(s) (11Mitchelhill K.I. Michell B.J. House C.M. Stapleton D. Dyck J. Gamble J. Ullrich C.

T172A mutation was accomplished using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) and the primer 5′-TTTAAGAGCTAGCTGTGGCTCGCCCA-3′. Methods were as according to manufacturer's instructions. The T172D mutant was created by site-directed PCR mutagenesis following the method of Chen and Przybla (18Chen B.B. Przybla A.E. Biotechniques. 1994; 17: 657-659PubMed Google Scholar). Primers for the first round of PCR were: 5′-TTTAAGAGACAGCTGTGGCTCGCCCA-3′ (upstream) and 5′-ACTGCCAGTGGGTCCTGGTTTC-3′ (downstream). An additional outer-nested upstream primer used for the second round of PCR was 5′-GACGTGGTCGGGAAAATCCG-3′. The product obtained from the second round was purified, digested with AatII and PmlI for cloning into the parent pEBG vector. A diagnostic PvuII site was introduced near the Thr-172 site at the same time. All mutated or truncated DNAs were sequenced over their full-length to verify the modification and that no additional regions contained mutations. COS7 cells were used in all reported experiments. Cells were cultured and transfected with cDNAs using lipofectAMINE reagent, as previously reported (13Dyck J.R.B. Gao G. Widmer J. Stapleton D. Fernandez C.S. Kemp B. Witters L.A. J. Biol.

At the end of the 5-h incubation with lipofectAMINE/DNA adducts, transfection media was replaced with normal Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for overnight recovery. To have the cells in log phase growth, in vivo labeling was performed at 24 h. At 24 h, transfected cells were washed 1× with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (room temperature) followed by 2× with 2 ml of pre-warmed, “cold” labeling media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium −Met, −Cys, no serum, no 35S). Cells were incubated in depleted media for 30 min. Preincubation media was aspirated off and replaced with 0.25 ml of prewarmed labeling media containing 150 μCi/ml Tran35S-label (ICN). Trans label is a mixture of 35S-labeled Met/Cys, 70%/20%, respectively. To prevent contamination of the tissue culture incubator, β-safe charcoal filter paper (Schleicher & Schüll) was cut and attached to the lids of the cell culture dishes. Cells were labeled for 1.5 h. During the label period, plates were rocked every 15 min to be sure the labeling media was evenly distributed. At the end of the pulse period, media was rapidly removed by aspiration, and the cells washed 2× each with 1 ml of chase media (5× excess Met/Cys, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum,). After the final wash, 2 ml of chase media was added to the wells, and incubation was continued for the desired amount of time (typically 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, or 24 h). At the desired time points, cells were washed 2× with 3 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped with a rubber policeman into 0.6 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and collected in a screw-capped Eppendorf tube. Cells were collected by centrifugation for 2 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Beckman Microfuge. The phosphate-buffered saline supernatant was aspirated off, and the cell pellet was snap-frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath. Cell pellets were then further processed by the Triton-X lysis method, pooling two wells of each condition at each time point (13Dyck J.R.B. Gao G. Widmer J. Stapleton D. Fernandez C.S. Kemp B. Witters L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17798-17803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein from each lysate (range 20–30 μg between experiments), as determined by the BCA assay (Pierce), were separately adsorbed to 20 μl of glutathione-agarose beads, as previously detailed (13Dyck J.R.B.

The adsorbed fractions, after extensive washing, were eluted into gel sample buffer by boiling for 5 min and were then subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by fluorography (Enhance, NEN Life Science Products) and PhosphorImager analysis of the dried gels on a Molecular Dynamics instrument. PhosphorImager data was analyzed with the program IPLabGel for pixel density quantification. The α synthetic rate was measured by quantitative immunoblotting of the newly synthesized epitope-tagged glutathione-S-transferase α proteins. COS7 cells were transiently transfected with the different α cDNAs with or without β- and γ-containing constructs. At 24 h, the media was changed, and cells were allowed to recover for 1 h. Cells were then harvested between 25 and 34 h post-transfection at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, or 9 h. Two wells for each condition were pooled at each time point taken. Cell pellets were subjected to Triton X-100 lysis, and equal amounts of total protein (∼30 μg), as determined by the Pierce BCA assay, were separately adsorbed to glutathione-agarose beads. The adsorbed fraction, eluted with sample buffer, was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis using an anti-α antibody able to recognize both full-length and truncated proteins (an antipeptide antibody raised against aa 266–280 of the α1 sequence). Blots were developed by chemiluminescence (Pierce Supersignal), and quantitative densitometry of the exposed film were performed with a scanning densitometer (Molecular Dynamics). Film exposure was kept within a linear range, by comparison to α standards. Pixel density was quantitated with IPLab Gel software. Total RNA was prepared from nontransfected and transfected cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). In this case, 3 wells of transfected cells were pooled for obtaining total RNA (10–30 μg). An equal amount of total RNA (1 μg) isolated from cells at each of the transfected conditions was reverse-transcribed using Ambion's RETROscript kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Products from the reverse transcription reactions were diluted either 1:10 or 1:100, and 1 μl of each dilution was used as the template in PCR reactions containing the following primers: 5′-CGTATTGAAGCTATCCCAC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CCGAAGTCGGCTATCTTTGC-3′ (reverse primer) as the AMPK-specific primer set and the 18 S primer set from Ambion as an internal control. A “hot start” of 94 °C for 5 min was included at the beginning of a general PCR program: 94 °C (1-min melt); 55 °C (1-min anneal); 72 °C (1-min extension); 20 cycles. The number of cycles were determined in separate control experiments using the same PCR reaction conditions. Twenty cycles was judged to give a measurable amount of product such that the accumulation of product was linear with respect to cycle number and input DNA. DNA products were separated and visualized in 2% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. Oligonucleotide primers were either obtained from Midland Certified Reagent Co. or from Life Technologies, Inc. All restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs. LipofectAMINE for transfections, cell culture-labeling media (Met/Cys-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium w/o glutamine), and stock amino acids for pulse-chase experiments (100× Met or Cys) were all from Life Technologies, Inc. Tran35S-label was from ICN, and β safe charcoal filter paper was from Schleicher & Schuell. The fluorophor was Enhance from DuPont and was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Glutathione-agarose was purchased from Sigma. The sources of all other reagents have been previously described (13Dyck J.R.B. Gao G. Widmer J. Stapleton D. Fernandez C.S. Kemp B. Witters L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17798-17803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we have shown that the mammalian AMPK α1 subunit binds the β and γ subunits to the C terminus between aa 392 and 548; this domain also serves as a dominant negative inhibitor of kinase activity (13Dyck J.R.B. Gao G. Widmer J. Stapleton D. Fernandez C.S. Kemp B. Witters L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17798-17803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The analysis of these subunit interactions is complicated by the observation that β and γ subunits bind to each other, as well as to the α subunit (13Dyck J.R.B. Gao G. Widmer J. Stapleton D. Fernandez C.S. Kemp B. Witters L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17798-17803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 21Cheung P.C.F. Carling D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: S668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To better understand any relationships between the N-terminal catalytic core of the α subunit and its C-terminal domains, a truncation analysis of the α-1 subunit was designed, in part, based on information derived from studies of the Snf1p protein kinase inS. cerevisiae (14Jiang R. Carlson M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3105-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 15Jiang R. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2099-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 16Yang X. Jiang R. Carlson M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5878-5886Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The yeast Snf1p kinase shares several regions of identity/homology to mammalian AMPK α-1 (Fig.1). Both contain an N-terminal catalytic kinase domain of approximately 270 aa and are 64% identical throughout this region, which extends to aa 281 in the α-1 sequence. There are at least three additional regions of homology in the C termini of these proteins, interspersed with deletions or insertions. One such region extending from aa 313–392 in the α-1 protein corresponds, in part, to a C-terminal regulatory domain region of Snf1p (aa 392–495), which is known to interact with the Snf4p, the AMPK γ subunit homolog (14Jiang R. Carlson M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3105-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar,15Jiang R. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2099-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The kinase domain of Snf1p also interacts with the Snf1p regulatory domain in a region that overlaps with the Snf4p binding site (Snf1p aa 392–518). Most importantly, studies of the Snf1p have shown that Snf4p reverses the autoinhibition of Snf1p kinase activity by the regulatory domain; deletion of the regulatory domain from the Snf1p polypeptide bypasses the requirement for Snf4p in Snf1p function, resulting in constitutive activation (14Jiang R. Carlson M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3105-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 15Jiang R. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2099-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). It was thus of interest to truncate the α-1 subunit to remove β/γ binding activity and to assess the impact of truncation on the activity of the kinase catalytic domain. Two C-terminal deletion constructs were created by inserting a stop codon into the open reading frame of the original pEBG-α1 construct engineered to truncate the mammalian AMPKα subunit at aa 312 or 392 (Fig. 1 A). The pEBG-α1 vector creates a fusion of the glutathione-S-transferase gene with rat liver AMPK α-1-coding region (13Dyck J.R.B. Gao G. Widmer J. Stapleton D. Fernandez C.S. Kemp B. Witters L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17798-17803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). These constructs were transfected into COS7 cells with or without hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged β and γ cDNAS in the pMT2 expression vector (13Dyck J.R.B. Gao G. Widmer J. Stapleton D. Fernandez C.S. Kemp B. Witters L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17798-17803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). After adsorption onto glutathione-agarose, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblot analysis using anti-α or anti-HA (for β/γ) specific antibodies, it was revealed that, whereas the wild-type α1 (548 aa; designated WTα548) binds co-expressed β and γ, only trace binding of β/γ to α1(1–392) (designated α392) and α1(1–312) (designated α312) was observed, despite higher levels of overall α expression (Fig.1 B). In other experiments (not shown), not only was AMPK heterotrimer formation totally absent with these truncations of α-1, but neither β or γ subunit alone was able to bind to truncated α to form enzyme heterodimers. Thus, the β/γ binding domain of α-1 maps entirely between aa 392 and 548 (Fig. 1 A). These experiments also revealed a large difference in the overall level of expression between the full-length and the C-terminal-truncated α protein, with much higher expression of the truncated fragments (Fig.1 B). These C-terminal truncations were overexpressed 5–10-fold as compared with the WTα548 protein (Fig.1 B; upper panel). As previously reported (13Dyck J.R.B. Gao G. Widmer J. Stapleton D. Fernandez C.S. Kemp B. Witters L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17798-17803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), a consistent 2–3-fold increase in the expression level of WTα548 subunit was observed on co-expression with the β and γ subunits (Fig. 1 B, compare lanes 1 and2). This increase in α expression was never observed for α312 or α392 proteins, when co-expressed with β and γ (Fig. 1 B; compare lanes 3 to4 and 5 to 6). The next question addressed was the effect on the catalytic activity of the α1 subunit upon removal of the regions responsible for binding β and γ subunits. Kinase activity between the different α subunits (with and without co-expressed β and γ subunits) was compared after transient transfection, cell harvest, and adsorption of α to glutathione-agarose followed by elution with reduced glutathione (13Dyck J.R.B.

The Dbl-like guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF) have been implicated in direct activation of these GTPases. Here we have identified a new member of the Dbl family, GEF-H1, by screening a human HeLa cell cDNA library. GEF-H1 encodes a 100-kDa protein containing the conserved structural array of a Dbl homology domain in tandem with a pleckstrin homology domain and is most closely related to thelfc oncogene, but additionally it contains a unique coiled-coil domain at the carboxyl terminus. Biochemical analysis reveals that GEF-H1 is capable of stimulating guanine nucleotide exchange of Rac and Rho but is inactive toward Cdc42, TC10, or Ras. Moreover, GEF-H1 binds to Rac and Rho proteins in both the GDP- and guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate-bound states without detectable affinity for Cdc42 or Ras. Immunofluorescence reveals that GEF-H1 colocalizes with microtubules through the carboxyl-terminal coiled-coil domain.

The Rho-related GTP-binding proteins of the Ras superfamily function as molecular switches in a variety of cellular signaling pathways, many of which influence the cell cytoskeletal organization and effect on physiological properties of cells such as cell polarity and motility (1Ridley A.J.

Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Rho family GTPases also play roles in transmission of growth factor and mitogen-initiated signals to the nucleus through kinase cascades (4Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N.

Members of this family of GTP-binding proteins include mammalian RhoA, RhoB, RhoC, RhoE, RhoG, Rac1, Rac2, Cdc42, and TC10. In fibroblast cells, RhoA has been shown to be involved in the regulation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesion formation (1Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3788) Google Scholar); Rac1 is required for membrane ruffling and lamellipodia formation induced by certain growth factors (2Ridey A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3041) Google Scholar), and Cdc42 appears to mediate the formation of filopodia and actin microspikes. In addition, Cdc42/Rac1/RhoA have been suggested to function in a hierarchical cascade to mediate these changes in the actin cytoskeleton in certain cells (15Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3682) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 all seem to be involved in the transcription regulation by serum response factor (6Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar) and in the regulation of cell cycle progression (7Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar) and are capable of regulating the activity of a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinases, the Jun amino-terminal kinase (4Coso O.A.

Similar to the cases for all members of the Ras superfamily proteins, the GTP-binding/GTP hydrolysis cycle of Rho-related proteins is tightly controlled (9Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar). The activation of Rho family proteins requires the exchange of bound GDP for GTP, a process catalyzed by the Dbl family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; DH, Dbl homology; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; ORF, open reading frame; PH, Pleckstrin homology; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; DH, Dbl homology; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; ORF, open reading frame; PH, Pleckstrin homology; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate.(8Cerione R. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Like the ligand-activated seven transmembrane receptors in activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins, the GEFs have high affinity for the guanine nucleotide free state of the GTPases and are thought to promote GDP release by stabilizing an intermediate transition state (12Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Mosteller R.D. Han J. Broek D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1104-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Most members of the Dbl family GEFs demonstrate tissue-specific distribution patterns and substrate (Rho proteins) specificity, whereas most of the Rho family GTPases are ubiquitous, suggesting that individual cell types and/or signaling pathways may employ a unique GEF/Rho family GTPase combination. Members of Dbl-like GEFs share a structural arrangement of an ∼200 amino acid motif, the Dbl homology (DH) domain, followed by a second signaling motif, the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (8Cerione R. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Previous studies of Dbl oncoprotein have established that the DH domain is responsible for the GEF catalytic activity for RhoA and Cdc42, whereas the PH domain in tandem serves to target the molecule to specific cytoskeleton locations (12Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Zheng Y. Zangrilli D. Cerione R.A. Eva A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19017-19020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Results obtained from the studies of several other Dbl-like molecules including Lfc and Lbc are also consistent with the model in which the DH domain and the PH domain modules are sufficient to account for their biological function: the DH domain provides Rho-specific catalytic activity and the PH domain dictates their cellular distribution patterns (11Olson M.F. Sterpetti P. Nagata K. Toksoz D. Hall A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2827-2832Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 13Whitehead I. Kirk H. Tognon C. Trigo-Gonzalez G. Kay R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18388-18395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, recent studies of the Dbl family members Vav and Tiam-1 revealed that regions outside the tandem DH and PH domains also have important roles in mediating their biological functions and, in particular, in regulating their patterns of cellular distribution (18Stam J.C. Sander E.E. Michiels F. van Leeuwen F.N. Kain H.E. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28447-28454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar,24Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that individual members of Dbl family may employ unique mechanisms in regulation of specific Rho proteins. A partial cDNA clone designated p40 was obtained previously in an effort to identify proliferation-regulatory genes from Hep-2 cells (32Reddy A.B. Chatterjee A. Rothblum L.I. Black A. Busch H. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 1763-1767PubMed Google Scholar). By screening a human HeLa cell cDNA library, we have now obtained a complete open reading frame (ORF) of p40. The predicted protein product of the ORF, GEF-H1, is a new member of Dbl family with a broad tissue distribution pattern. GEF-H1 functions as a GEF for Rac and Rho proteins in vitro and binds to Rac and Rho in both the GDP- and the GTP-bound states. Furthermore, GEF-H1 colocalizes with microtubules in cells mediated by its unique carboxyl-terminal coiled-coil domain instead of its PH domain, and its overexpression in COS-7 cells results in induction of membrane ruffles. Thus, GEF-H1 represents a novel Dbl-like GEF that may have a direct role in activating Rac and/or Rho and serve to bring the activated GTPase to cellular microtubules. A HeLa cell cDNA library was generated using a kit from CLONTECH following standard protocols (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 8.2-8.85Google Scholar). A double-stranded adaptor was ligated to both ends of the cDNA library by using T4 DNA ligase, and the adaptor-ligated cDNAs were then used to selectively amplify 5′ cDNA fragments by polymerase chain reaction with a combination of a p40-specific primer GSP4 (5′ GCAGTGACCCCAGGACTCGTGTTAC 3′) and an adaptor-specific primer. The polymerase chain reaction products were cloned into pBluescript vector and were sequenced by the dideoxy nucleotide method using Sequenase 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Data bank searches for sequence homology were performed using the BLAST program (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). A human multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) containing approximately 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA per lane from eight different human tissues was hybridized with either 5′ end (nucleotides 1–1624) or 3′ end (nucleotides 2251–2573) sequences labeled with [γ-32P]dATP. The hybridization and washing conditions were as described by the CLONTECH protocols. The glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion products of small GTP-binding proteins were expressed in Escherichia coliusing the pGEX vectors as described (29Pasteris N.G. Cadle A. Logie L.J. Porteous M.E.M. Schwartz C.E. Stevenson R.E. Glover T.W. Wilroy R.S. Gorski J.L. Cell. 1994; 79: 669-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Purification of the GST-fused G-proteins from E. coli was also carried out as described (29Pasteris N.G. Cadle A. Logie L.J. Porteous M.E.M. Schwartz C.E. Stevenson R.E. Glover T.W. Wilroy R.S. Gorski J.L. Cell. 1994; 79: 669-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The GST-Lbc protein was synthesized in the baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells and purified by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography (16Toksoz D. Williams D.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 621-628PubMed Google Scholar). The GEF-H1 baculovirus construct, pBacGEF-H1, was made by cloning anEcoRI/BglII fragment of GEF-H1 containing the complete ORF into the EcoRI/BglII sites of the transfer vector pVL1393 (PharMingen). Recombinant baculovirus was produced as described previously (33Ren Y. Busch R.K. Durban E. Taylor C. Gustafson W. Valdez B. Li Y.P. Smetana K. Busch H. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The virus-infected Sf9 cells were washed once with ice-cold buffer A containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, and aprotinin before lysing with 0.4% Triton X-100 in buffer A for 30 min at 4 °C. The resuspended cells were further homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C. The clarified supernatant was incubated with 3 μg of anti-GEF-H1 polyclonal antibody raised against a GST-GEF-H1 fusion protein (amino acid residues 691–891 of GEF-H1) in rabbits for 1 h, followed by a 2-h additional incubation with 5 μg of protein A-coupled agarose beads (Sigma). Duplicate samples from which the anti-GEF-H1 antibody was omitted were used as controls. The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with buffer A. The time courses for [3H]GDP/GTP exchange of Rho family GTPases in the presence or absence of GEF-H1, GST-Lbc, or GST were determined as described using the nitrocellulose filtration method (34Diekmann D. Brill S. Garrett M.D. Totty N. Hsuan J. Monfries C. Hall C. Lim L. Hall A. Nature. 1991; 351: 400-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The quantities of GTP-binding proteins and the amounts of GST, GST-Lbc, or GEF-H1 used for each experiment were determined by Coomassie Blue staining of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Complex formation of GEF-H1 with GST-fused small GTP-binding proteins was carried out essentially as described for the Dbl-G-protein interactions (29Pasteris N.G. Cadle A. Logie L.J. Porteous M.E.M.

Briefly, GEF-H1-expressing Sf9 cells were lysed at 4 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton 100, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. The lysates were precleaned by incubation with 20 μg of GST on agarose beads for 30 min at 4 °C. Approximately 5 μg of each GST-fused small G-proteins were immobilized on agarose-glutathione beads, washed three times in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA, and then mixed with the precleaned cell lysates (∼200 μg of total protein) for 1 h. The washed precipitates from the mixtures were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blot analysis using anti-GEF-H1 polyclonal antibody. The immune complexes were visualized by chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cDNAs encoding full-length GEF-H1 and Lbc or the amino-terminal residues encompassing the DH and PH domains (residues 1–604) of GEF-H1 were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pFLAG-CMV-2 (Eastman Kodak). COS-7 or NIH 3T3 cells were transfected by Lipofectin following the instructions from Life Technologies, Inc. Transfected COS-7 cells on chamber slides were fixed and permeabilized with 100% methanol at −20 °C for 10 min. After washing, the cells were incubated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (1:300 dilution) in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature, rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated for 1 h with fluorescein-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody. After rinsing with phosphate-buffered saline for three times, the cells were mounted in glycerol. The transfected NIH 3T3 cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PEM buffer (100 mmPipes, pH 6.8, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmMgCl2) for 5 min. They were then incubated with a 1:200 dilution of the rabbit anti-GEF-H1 antibody for 1 h. After washing with PEM buffer, the cells were incubated with a 1:5 dilution of the mouse anti-tubulin antibody (ICN) for 60 min, followed by incubation with 1:80 fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG together with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson) for an additional 45 min. The stained cells were viewed with a Nikon microscope equipped with a photographic camera. Previously a partial cDNA clone termed p40 was isolated from a Hep-2 cDNA library, and the protein product was thought to play a role in regulation of cell proliferation (32Reddy A.B. Chatterjee A. Rothblum L.I. Black A. Busch H. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 1763-1767PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain the complete ORF of this clone, a 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed by polymerase chain reaction in a HeLa cell cDNA library with the combination of a p40-specific primer GSP4 complementary to the p40 nucleotide residues 187–212 (32Reddy A.B. Chatterjee A. Rothblum L.I. Black A. Busch H. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 1763-1767PubMed Google Scholar) and an adaptor-specific primer in the linker region of the library. A cDNA clone containing 3630 bases with a single ORF starting with an ATG codon at nucleotide 103 was obtained during the screen (Fig.1). The ATG codon is in a moderately good context of Kozak sequences for translation initiation with a purine (A) at −3 and a pyrimidine (T) at +4 (31Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ORF predicts a protein of 894 amino acids in length with a calculated molecular mass of 100 kDa. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of this clone with protein sequences in the Swiss Protein Data Bank revealed no apparent identity, indicating that the cDNA is likely to represent a novel gene. Subsequent protein homology searches revealed that the predicted amino acid sequences contain a DH domain followed by a PH domain from amino acids 238–572 (Fig. 2); these sequences are 23, 48, 51, and 88% identical to the homologous regions of Dbl (10Quiliam L.A. Khosravi-Far R. Huff S.Y. Der C.J. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 309-404Google Scholar), Lbc (16Toksoz D. Williams D.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 621-628PubMed Google Scholar), RhoGEF (26Gebbink M.F.B.G. Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P.G. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and Lfc (13Whitehead I. Kirk H. Tognon C. Trigo-Gonzalez G. Kay R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18388-18395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), respectively. We therefore designated this protein as GEF-H1. In addition to the tandem DH and PH domains, GEF-H1 also contains a cysteine-rich zinc finger-like motif at its amino terminus, which is similar to that found in Lfc (13Whitehead I. Kirk H. Tognon C. Trigo-Gonzalez G. Kay R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18388-18395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Aside from the 12% differences over the amino-terminal 414 amino acids, GEF-H1 differs from Lfc by an extra region of 310 amino acid residues at the carboxyl-terminal half, which is weakly homologous to the cytoskeleton protein Plectin (21Wiche G. Becker K. Luber K. Weitzer G. Castanon M.J. Hauptmann R. Stratowa C. Stewart M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 83-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and RhoGEF (26Gebbink M.F.B.G. Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P.G. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 D). Further structural prediction by the COILS program suggests that this region of GEF-H1 may form an α-helical coiled-coil structure. These sequence analyses suggest that GEF-H1 is a novel member of the Dbl family GEFs. Northern blot analysis using the 5′-half of GEF-H1 cDNA as a probe detected a single 4.4-kilobase pair mRNA band in the total RNA samples from a wide range of human tissues including spleen, thymus, prostate, testis, uterus, small intestine, colon, and leukocytes, with higher staining intensity in the normalized samples from thymus, testis, and leukocytes (Fig. 3). Northern blot using a probe derived from the 3′-half of GEF-H1 yielded a similar pattern (Fig. 3). We conclude that the mRNA of GEF-H1 is broadly present in human tissues, with relatively higher levels in the thymus, testis, and leukocytes. Since GEF-H1 shares considerable sequence homology with Lbc and Lfc of the Dbl family small G-protein regulators which have been shown to be Rho-specific GEFs, we examined potential GEF activity of GEF-H1 toward RhoA. Fig.4 shows that GEF-H1 is capable of stimulating the dissociation of [3H]GDP from RhoA when immunopurified from recombinant GEF-H1 baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. In the absence of GEF-H1 protein, the half-time for dissociation of GDP from RhoA was relatively slow, i.e. >30 min at room temperature. However, GEF-H1 accelerated the rate of GDP dissociation by at least 10-fold; the half-time for GDP dissociation became 2–3 min. The purified GST-Lbc was used as a positive control, and the purified GST and anti-GEF-H1 immunoprecipitates of Dbl virus-infected Sf9 cell lysates were used as negative controls in similar assays (Fig. 4 and data not shown). When the activity of GEF-H1 to stimulate GDP/GTP exchange was examined for a panel of small G-proteins, it was found that GEF-H1 was active as a GEF for RhoA, RhoB, RhoC, and Rac1, but not for Ras, Cdc42, or TC10 under similar conditions (Fig. 5). Thus, GEF-H1 appears to be an effective GEF for Rho and Rac GTPases in vitro.Figure 5GEF-H1 stimulates GDP dissociation from Rac and Rho GTPases. GDP dissociation assays were carried out as in Fig. 4 using immunopurified GEF-H1 (1 μg) and 0.3 μg of recombinant GST fusion of Ras, Ran, RhoA, RhoB, RhoC, TC10, Rac1, or Cdc42. The reactions were terminated after 5 min incubation at 25 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Certain members of the Dbl family,e.g. Ect-2, bind to Rho-related GTP-binding proteins without detectable GEF activity (15Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3682) Google Scholar, 17Miki T. Smith C.L. Long J.E. Eva A. Fleming T.P. Nature. 1993; 362: 462-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). To determine whether GEF-H1 interacts solely with Rho and Rac and to examine the nucleotide dependence of the interaction, we carried out a complex formation assay using immobilized GST fusion RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42, or Ras and insect cell lysates overexpressing recombinant GEF-H1. The binding of GEF-H1 to the GTP-binding proteins was assayed when the G-proteins are in the guanine nucleotide-free state, GDP-bound state, or GTPγS-bound state. As shown in Fig. 6, GEF-H1 bound to RhoA and Rac1 with relatively high affinity, and this binding occurred approximately equally well when RhoA and Rac1 were at any one of the three states. In contrast, GEF-H1 was unable to bind to Ras or Cdc42 in any of the nucleotide-binding states in the similar assay (Fig. 6 and data not shown). Therefore, GEF-H1 is a Rho- and Rac-specific GEF capable of direct interaction with the G-proteins in both the GDP- and the GTP-bound state. To investigate the potential role of GEF-H1 in vivo, an epitope-tagged variant of GEF-H1 was constructed in pFLAG-CMV-2 vector, and the cDNA was transfected into COS-7 and NIH 3T3 cells. The transfected cells were stained with either monoclonal anti-Flag antibody M2 or a polyclonal anti-GEF-H1 antibody raised against the carboxyl-terminal region of the molecule for visualization of the expression pattern. As shown in Fig.7 A, staining with the M2 antibody revealed a filamentous distribution pattern of GEF-H1. This pattern does not correlate with that of actin structures of the cell, which was visualized by rhodamine-labeled phalloidin staining (data not shown). However, when the cells expressing GEF-H1 were stained with monoclonal anti-tubulin antibody, they displayed a similar filamentous fluorescent image as that by anti-GEF-H1 antibody staining (Fig.8). To determine the possible colocalization relationship of GEF-H1 with tubulin, the effect of the microtubule-disrupting agent colcemid was examined. The GEF-H1-transfected cells were pretreated with 0.06 μg/ml colcemid for 30 min before GEF-H1, and cellular microtubules were labeled with immunofluorescent probes. Fig. 7 B shows that colcemid caused an unwinding of the filamentous structure of GEF-H1. In some cases, the filamentous staining pattern of GEF-H1 was changed to a punctate form (Fig. 7 B). Since colcemid specifically disrupts microtubule structures (19Sherwood S.W. Sheridan J.P. Schimke R.T. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 215: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), these results indicate that GEF-H1 indeed colocalizes with microtubules of the cell.Figure 8Immunolocalization of GEF-H1 in NIH 3T3 cells. Double labeling immunofluorescence (fluorescein-labeled anti-rabbit IgG for rabbit polyclonal anti-GEF-H1 in A and rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for monoclonal anti-tubulin inB) were used to visualize GEF-H1 and tubulin in cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether the amino-terminal Lfc homology half of GEF-H1 might have a role in influencing its subcellular localization pattern, a mutant form of GEF-H1 (residues 1–604) was generated with deletion of the carboxyl-terminal coiled-coil domain. This truncation mutant was found to display a punctate distribution pattern throughout the cytoplasm and in dense irregular perinuclear aggregates (Fig.7 C), differing markedly from the filamentous pattern of the full-length protein (Fig. 7 A). Thus, the carboxyl-terminal coiled-coil domain appears to be essential for GEF-H1-microtubule colocalization. Moreover, this pattern of distribution seems unique for GEF-H1 since Lbc, which contains a few more amino acid sequences than the DH and PH domains, was found to be most diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm when overexpressed in COS-7 cells (Fig.7 D). To see whether GEF-H1 may act as a GEF for Rac or Rho proteins in vivo, the effect of its overexpression on the morphology of COS-7 cells was examined. The expression of GEF-H1 was determined by fluorescence microscopy 36 h post-transfection by anti-GEF-H1 antibody staining, and cell morphology was visualized by phase contrast microscopy. In cells showing positive staining with GEF-H1 antibody (Fig.9 A), large membrane ruffles at the edges of cells were present (Fig. 9 B). Further labeling of the cells with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin revealed that these ruffling membranes contained dense actin patches (Fig. 9 C), similar to the effect observed when a constitutively active form of Rac was present (15Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3682) Google Scholar). On the other hand, little change in morphology was detected in mock-transfected cells (data not shown). Given the previous observation that membrane ruffling and lamellipodia formation are through a Rac-mediated pathway (15Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3682) Google Scholar), these results are consistent with the possibility that GEF-H1 activates endogenous Rac in these cells resulting in actin reorganization. In the present study, we have identified a complete ORF from a human HeLa cell cDNA library, which encodes a novel Dbl family protein GEF-H1. Like all known Dbl family members, GEF-H1 contains a DH domain in tandem with a PH domain, which is highly homologous to that of Lfc, an exchange factor specific for Rho (13Whitehead I. Kirk H. Tognon C. Trigo-Gonzalez G. Kay R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18388-18395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 30Whitehead I.P. Khosravi-Far R. Kirk H. Trigo-Gonzalez G. Der C.J. Kay R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18643-18650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Yet differing from Lfc, GEF-H1 contains an extended coiled-coil carboxyl terminus that shows a weak homology to Plectin, an intermediate filament binding protein (28Wiche G. Becker B. Luber K. Weitzer G. Castanon M.J. Hauptmann R. Stratowa C. Stewart M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 83-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Further differing from Lfc, probing the mRNA of GEF-H1 revealed a single hybridization band of 4.4 kilobase pairs in size (comparing to 3.7-, 3.3-, and 4.5-kilobase pair mRNA bands seen for Lfc) which is broadly present in human tissues. Further biochemical and cell biological characterizations of GEF-H1 revealed a few additional unique properties of GEF-H1 as follows: 1) it shows guanine nucleotide exchange activity toward both Rho and Rac; 2) it binds to Rho and Rac in all three nucleotide-binding states; and 3) it colocalizes with microtubules in cells that are mediated through the carboxyl-terminal coiled-coil sequences. Although GEF-H1 is capable of stimulating GDP/GTP exchange on RhoA, this action does not appear to be catalytic since the stimulated GDP-release from RhoA can reach completion only when stoichiometric amounts of GEF-H1 (versus RhoA) were present (Fig.4). 2Y. Ren and Y. Zheng, unpublished observations. This observation can be rationalized by the fact that GEF-H1 binds to Rho and Rac independently of their nucleotide binding status (Fig. 6) and therefore remains bound to RhoA-GTP even after the GDP/GTP exchange is accomplished. This nucleotide-independent binding to small GTPases is similar to the Dbl family members Ect2 and RhoGEF and to the Rho family G-protein effectors IQGAP2 (36Brill S. Li S. Lyman C.W. Church D.M. Wasmuth J.J. Weissbach L. Bernards A. Snijders A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4869-4878Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and PRK2 (22Vincent S. Settleman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2247-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), suggesting that GEF-H1 recognizes the GTPase elements that do not make a major conformational change from the GDP- to GTP-bound state. If the classic GEF-G protein interaction mechanism in which the exchange of GDP by GTP has to undergo a nucleotide-depleted “transition state” can be applied to the GEF-H1-Rho interaction, it would be expected that the nucleotide-free state of Rho and Rac may have at least a slightly higher affinity toward GEF-H1. However, this effect of GEF-H1 binding to Rho and Rac was not detected, possibly due to the qualitative nature of the complex formation assay used to measure the binding interaction. Although recognition of the small G-proteins at the GTP-bound state may satisfy one criterion as a potential effector of G-protein function, a constitutively bound protein can also serve as a carrier to recruit binding partners to potential target sites in cells. In this sense, GEF-H1 may qualify both as a GEF activator and a shuttling/recruiting scaffold that brings the activated Rho proteins to microtubule structures. The unique carboxyl-terminal coiled-coil region of GEF-H1 is weakly homologous to Plectin, an intermediate filament binding protein. Results from the carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant of GEF-H1 indicate that this section of GEF-H1 is essential for the microtubule-associated distribution pattern in cells (Fig. 7 C). Interestingly, a fraction of Rac in cells was also found to colocalize with microtubules and to recognize tubulin in a GTP-dependent manner (25Best A. Ahmed S. Kozma R. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3756-3762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Together with the biochemical results here showing that GEF-H1 is capable of activating Rac and interacts with Rac at both the GDP- and GTP-bound states, one possible mode of action by GEF-H1 may be that it recognizes Rac in the inactive GDP-bound state, stimulates its GDP/GTP exchange, and brings the GTP-bound, active form of Rac to one of the target sites at the microtubule locations. Consistent with the possibility that Rac is the preferred substrate for GEF-H1 in cells, GEF-H1 induces membrane-ruffling formation, which is the characteristic change controlled by Rac in many cell types. Alternatively, GEF-H1 may activate Rho in certain cells and further serves to recruit the GTP-bound form of Rho to microtubules to execute Rho function there, since there is also evidence that Rho may be an important regulator of microtubule structures (20Cook T.A. Nagasaki T. Gundersen G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Joining Dbl, Lbc, Lfc, Lsc, p115, Trio, and RhoGEF of the Dbl family, GEF-H1 may provide another link to Rho activation. The reason that a surprisingly large number of Dbl family members can activate Rho may reside in their differences in tissue distribution, subcellular localization, substrate specificity, and mode of regulation by upstream and/or feedback signals. For example, localization of Lfc to the plasma membranes by the PH domain is important for its transforming function (13Whitehead I. Kirk H. Tognon C. Trigo-Gonzalez G. Kay R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18388-18395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), targeting of Lbc and Dbl to cytoskeleton by the PH domains is essential to their oncogenic activity (11Olson M.F. Sterpetti P. Nagata K. Toksoz D. Hall A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2827-2832Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 27Zheng Y. Zangrilli D. Cerione R.A. Eva A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19017-19020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and membrane translocation mediated by an amino-terminal unique PH domain of Tiam1 is required for its transforming potential (18Stam J.C. Sander E.E. Michiels F. van Leeuwen F.N. Kain H.E. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28447-28454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The recent findings that the amino-terminal coiled-coil domain of p115 contains an RGS motif and is subjected to regulation by the heterotrimeric G-protein Gα13 (23Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar) further suggest that each Dbl-like GEF may employ a unique mode of regulation and links a subpopulation of Rho GTPases to specific upstream signals via a distinct mechanism. Many Dbl family GEF members are oncogene products (8Cerione R. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Both the DH domain and PH domain are essential for their transforming activity, and in many cases an additional motif at the amino terminus or carboxyl terminus of the DH and PH module, particularly a coiled-coil domain, constitutes an inhibitory constraint on their oncogenic potentials (8Cerione R. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). In NIH 3T3 cells, GEF-H1 displayed a very weak foci-forming activity when compared with Lbc.2 Whether GEF-H1 belongs to the oncogene superfamily and its carboxyl-terminal coiled-coil domain causes an inhibition in its transforming capability are currently under investigation. The important questions on which signaling pathway involves GEF-H1/Rac or GEF-H1/Rho combination and how the exchange factor is turned on in response to upstream signaling events will have to be addressed in future studies to gain a full understanding of the cellular functions of GEF-H1."

These endosomes consist of tubular-vesicular membrane networks where EGF·EGFR complexes are seen co-localized with recycling receptors, for instance, transferrin receptors (10Miller K. Beardmore J.

Cell. 1990; 61: 623-634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Once incorporated into internal membranes of MVE, EGFRs are incapable of recycling. MVE can directly fuse with lysosomes (15Futter C.E. Pearse A. Hewlett L.J. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1011-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), which ultimately leads to the proteolytic degradation of EGFR. To date, visualization of EGFR endocytosis has been largely limited to immunocytochemical analyses on chemically fixed cells. Fixation and following sample preparation for light and electron microscopy analysis often lead to dramatic changes in the morphology of the endosomal compartments and may also cause the artifactual re-distribution of the proteins. Fluorescence microscopy and video recording of living cells using fluorescent conjugates of EGF or antibodies to EGFR have been used to follow the passage of the EGFR through the endosomal compartments (11Hopkins C.R. Gibson A. Shipman M. Miller K. Nature. 1990; 346: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 16Schlessinger J. Shechter Y. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2659-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). However, this approach has major limitations, including non-stoichiometric labeling of the receptors, possible modification of the receptor behavior, partial dissociation of ligand-receptor complexes in acidic organelles and sorting of ligand and receptors to different compartments, and an inability to label intracellular receptors in non-permeabilized cells. GFP from jellyfish Aequorea victoria has been utilized as a reporter molecule in the fluorescent localization of several proteins (17Chalfie M. Tu Y. Euskirchen G. Ward W.W. Prasher D.C. Science. 1994; 263: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (5508) Google Scholar, 18Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Martenson C. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Mol.

GFP stoichiometrically labels as a fusion protein when integrated into the cDNA and expressed, and it can be excited by blue light and efficiently registered as green fluorescence. However, its size, about 26 kDa, makes it an unlikely candidate for creating a normally functioning EGFR-GFP chimera. Interestingly, we report here the preparation and the characterization of biochemical properties of the functional EGFR chimera with GFP that is fused to the carboxyl terminus of the receptor. The observed behavior of the chimera suggests that EGFR-GFP and other similarly conjugated receptor tyrosine kinases should be important tools in vivo for optical measurement of biochemical and biophysical processes relevant to growth factor receptor signaling and trafficking. Human recombinant EGF was obtained from Collaborative Research Inc. Mouse receptor-grade EGF was iodinated using modified chloramine-T method as described previously (20Sorkin A. Waters C.M. Overholser K.A. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8355-8362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity of 125I-EGF was 1.5–19 × 105 cpm/ng. EGF conjugated with Texas Red (EGF-TR) was synthesized using Texas Red N-succinimidyl ester (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The conjugate (EGF-TR) was purified from free N-succinimidyl Texas Red by gel filtration. The binding of EGF-TR to the cells was completely blocked by an excess of unlabeled EGF and is therefore specific. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies 986 and 451 against EGFR (anti-EGFR) were a gift from Dr. G. Carpenter (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). Rabbit serum Ab2913 specific to the intracellular domain of EGFR was a gift of Dr. L. Beguinot (DIBIT Rafaele, Milan, Italy). Mouse monoclonal antibody 225 hybridoma cells were obtained from ATCC. Mouse monoclonal anti-EGFR (LA22) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Monoclonal antibody to Shc and the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (pY20-HRP) were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-active MAP kinase was from Promega. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to GFP were fromCLONTECH. A bright green mutant of GFP, enhanced GFP (CLONTECH), was attached to the carboxyl terminus of human EGFR by standard recombinant techniques. Briefly, the full-length cDNA of EGFR including 3′- and 5′-untranslated region sequences was excised from pXER (21Bertics P.J. Weber W. Cochet C. Gill G.N. J. Cell. Biochem. 1985; 29: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) by sequential digestion withBglII and HindIII and then ligated into theNheI and HindIII sites of pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH). This yielded a full-length EGFR expression construct that is not fused to GFP, termed pEGFR-wt. To create the EGFR-GFP fusion, this construct was digested withHincII and HindIII to remove a fragment containing the distal coding sequence (corresponding to residues 1099–1186 of the coding sequence and the 5′-untranslated region). Then a 492-base pair fragment corresponding to amino acids 1022 and 1186 was prepared by polymerase chain reaction; the back primer contained no stop codon and an engineered HindIII restriction site. This large fragment was digested with HincII andHindIII to yield a replacement fragment of 261 base pairs that was ligated into pEGFR-wt to yield pEGFR-GFP. HEK 293 obtained from Dr. D. Cooper (University of Colorado), NIH 3T3, and porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells (obtained from Dr. L. Claesson-Welsh, LICR, Uppsala, Sweden) were used for various experiments. HEK 293 and NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and PAE cells in Ham's F-12, each containing 10% newborn calf serum, antibiotics, and glutamine in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. For most experiments, unless otherwise mentioned, cells were serum-starved overnight in basal media (DMEM or Ham's F-12) supplemented with 5% (v/v) conditioned media. Cells were transfected with pEGFR-GFP or pEGFR-wt DNA using the LipofectAMINE method (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transient transfections were used for all experiments with HEK 293 cells. Stable transformants of NIH 3T3 cells were obtained by selection with G418, and then a pool of bright fluorescent cells was obtained by flow sorting. The sorted pool of EGFR-GFP-expressing cells was maintained and used for experiments as indicated. NIH 3T3 cells expressing wild-type EGFR (wt-1, wt-2, and wt-8) have been described previously (8Sorkin A. Mazzotti M. Sorkina T. Scotto L. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13377-13384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 22Tebar F. Sorkina T. Sorkin A. Ericsson M. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28727-28730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Individual clonal lines of NIH 3T3 expressing EGFR-GFP were established by single cell plating into 96-well dishes. PAE cells expressing either EGFR-wt or EGFR-GFP were selected with G418 and established by limited dilution and single cell plating. Cells were grown to 50% confluency in various sized culture dishes dictated by the scale of the experiment. The cells were serum-starved overnight. Cells were washed twice with binding media (DMEM or Ham's F-12, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and then treated or not with EGF in binding media for the times indicated at 37 °C and rinsed twice with ice-cold Ca2+,Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (CMF-PBS). Cells were lysed by scraping with a rubber policeman into 100–300 μl of freshly prepared TGH lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, with 1 mmorthovanadate, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml iodoacetamide, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1% Sigma protease mixture inhibitors). In some instances 1% sodium deoxycholate was added to TGH. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min and then mixed with 2× Laemmli buffer and heated at 80 °C for 5 min. Samples were electrophoresed through various concentrations of SDS-PAGE as indicated, and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were probed with various monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies which were detected with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies or protein-A and chemiluminescence (Pierce and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described in the figure legends. NIH 3T3 EGFR-GFP cells (clone 11) were grown in 35-mm dishes and metabolically labeled overnight with [35S]methionine (50 μCi per dish) in methionine-free media containing 1% dialyzed calf serum. Cells were washed twice on ice in binding media and then incubated for 30 min in binding media at 37 °C. Cells were rinsed once more in binding media and further incubated with or without 500 ng/ml EGF in binding media for the times indicated. After incubation cells were briefly rinsed in ice-cold CMF-PBS, and the plates were frozen at −80 °C. After all incubations were complete, all cells were thawed and simultaneously scraped into TGH lysis buffer and gently rotated for 10 min as described above. The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 10 min; the supernatants were recovered, and EGFR was immunoprecipitated with saturating amounts of Ab986 for 3 h at 4 °C, followed by protein-A Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted and washed twice with TGH supplemented with 100 mm NaCl and then once without NaCl. The immunoprecipitates were mixed with Laemmli buffer, heated to 80 °C, and then electrophoresed through an SDS-7.5% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was analyzed by a PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad) and exposed to x-ray film. Co-immunoprecipitation of EGFR interacting proteins was performed on NIH 3T3 clones stably expressing EGFR-wt (wt-8) and EGFR-GFP (GFP-11). Cells were plated at 25% confluency in appropriate media and grown overnight. They were then serum-starved overnight in basal media supplemented with 5% conditioned media. Cells were washed twice in binding medium and then incubated with or without 500 ng/ml EGF in binding medium for 8 min at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in TGH buffer as described above. The lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were split into two aliquots incubated with Ab451 or normal rabbit IgG for 3 h at 4 °C and then 1 h after addition of protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with cold TGH supplemented with 100 mm NaCl and then once without NaCl. The electrophoresis, transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, and Western blot analysis were carried out as described above. To monitor125I-EGF internalization, cells in 12-well dishes were incubated with 125I-EGF in binding medium at 37 °C for 1–6 min. The concentration of 125I-EGF was 0.2–1 ng/ml to occupy less than 15,000 receptors per cell and to avoid saturation of the internalization machinery. After the indicated times, the medium was aspirated, and the monolayers were rapidly washed three times with DMEM to remove unbound ligand. The cells were then incubated for 5 min with 0.2 m acetic acid, pH 2.8, containing 0.5m NaCl at 4 °C. The acid wash was combined with another short rinse in the same buffer and used to determine the amount of surface-bound 125I-EGF. Finally the cells were lysed in 1m NaOH to determine the internalized radioactivity. The ratio of internalized:surface radioactivity was plotted against time. The linear regression coefficient of the dependence of this ratio for time represents the specific rate constant for internalization. Nonspecific binding was measured for each time point in the presence of 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled EGF and was not more than 3–7% of the total counts. To monitor EGFR down-regulation, cells in 12-well dishes were incubated for various times with or without EGF (100 ng/ml) in binding medium at 37 °C and rinsed with cold DMEM, and surface-bound EGF was removed by successive incubations with ice-cold 0.2 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, containing 0.5 m NaCl for 2 min and 20 s followed by two rinses with DMEM. The acid wash procedure did not affect the binding properties of EGFR. The number of binding sites on the cell surface was then determined by incubating the cells with 100 ng/ml125I-EGF at 4 °C for 1 h. Cells grown on coverslips were washed twice in binding media and then treated with EGF. Cells were then washed in CMF-PBS and fixed with freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 12 min at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized with CMF-PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 3 min. Coverslips were then incubated in the same buffer, in which Triton X-100 was omitted, at room temperature for 1 h with the primary antibody (Ab225 for EGFR), washed intensively, and then incubated with secondary donkey anti-mouse IgG labeled with Texas Red (ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). The primary and secondary antibody solutions were precleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 10 min. The cells were then mounted in Fluoromount-G (Fisher) containing 1 mg/mlpara-phenylenediamine. A Nikon Diaphot 300 microscope equipped with × 100 1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion objective lens, and the single fluorochrome filter sets for either Texas Red, fluorescein (for GFP), or simultaneous Texas Red/fluorescein fluorescence (Chroma Inc.) were used for visualization and recording the images. PAE cells expressing EGFR-GFP (clone A11) were grown in glass chambers (Bioptechs, Inc.), and serum-starved overnight. For double-color time-lapse microscopy, cells were washed once with binding medium, and then the chamber was mounted onto the microscope stage, and the image acquisition through the narrow GFP (excitation 492/10 nm) or Texas Red (excitation 572/10) channels was started. EGF-TR (20 ng/ml) was added to the chamber and washed away after 5 min of incubation. The cells were further incubated in CO2 incubator at 37 °C and periodically mounted on a microscope stage for image acquisition. Typically, 15–25 serial two-dimensional images were recorded at 200-nm intervals using a thermoelectrically cooled charged-coupled device (CCD) Micromax camera (Princeton Instruments), Nikon Diaphot microscope equipped with z-step motor and dual filter wheel controlled by QED Imaging software. The intensity of light was decreased to 5% of maximum by neutral filters. Image deconvolution was performed on DeltaVision workstation (Applied Precision, Inc.). To observe rapid dynamics of EGFR-GFP endocytosis, EGF (100 ng/ml) was added to the cell chamber, and GFP images were acquired 2 times per s (0.3-s exposure) continuously during incubation at 37 °C on a microscope stage. To prepare fluorescent-labeled EGFR, the GFP was fused to the carboxyl terminus of full-length human EGFR (Fig. 1). Carboxyl terminus is a domain that undergoes serine and tyrosine phosphorylation in response to EGF and docks several molecules involved in receptor signaling and trafficking. Placing a 26-kDa protein near this regulatory domain may affect EGFR functioning. Therefore, the properties of the chimeric receptor must be characterized prior to its use in optical microscopy studies. EGFR-GFP has been expressed both transiently and stably in several cell lines that either possess low levels or lack any detectable endogenous EGFR. Fig. 2 shows Western blot analysis of the stable expression of EGFR-GFP in NIH 3T3 cells that have been previously used in several studies of transfected EGFR. Cells were treated or not treated with EGF, and the lysates were probed with antibodies specific for human EGFR or GFP (Fig. 2, A andB). Both antibodies reveal the predicted size for the chimera (∼203 kDa). Anti-EGFR does not identify free EGFR at 175 kDa, and anti-GFP do not detect free GFP at 26 kDa (data not shown). Together these data confirm the stability of EGFR-GFP. After prolonged incubation with EGF, three lower molecular weight fragments of EGFR-GFP migrating at approximate molecular mass of 160, 120, and 117 kDa (seen in longer exposures) appear (Fig. 2,A and B). To determine whether the low molecular weight fragments are the degradation products or newly synthesized immature receptors, NIH 3T3 cells expressing EGFR-GFP were treated with EGF in the presence or absence of chloroquine, a drug that specifically blocks the lysosomal degradation of EGFR. As shown in Fig.3 A, in the absence of chloroquine, EGF-dependent degradation of the receptor occurs with the accumulation of 160-, 120-, and 117-kDa bands. In contrast, chloroquine blocks degradation as demonstrated by the increase in levels of full-length receptor (includes newly synthesized receptor) and by the absence of degradation products. Since detection of EGFR-GFP with anti-GFP is dependent upon the intact carboxyl terminus, the initial degradation of EGFR-GFP involves the extracellular domain of the receptor. The inhibition of degradation by chloroquine implicates lysosomal enzymes. Activation of the EGFR occurs as a consequence of ligand binding leading to receptor dimerization and tyrosine autophosphorylation and is also accompanied by a characteristic gel shift of the receptor band to an apparent higher molecular weight species. As shown in Fig. 2, EGF binding results in appearance of slow-migrating forms of EGFR-GFP indicating normal receptor activation. The EGFR-GFP activation persists for at least 1 h, after which dephosphorylation, characterized by a return to the native molecular weight mobility, is observed. This dephosphorylation is accompanied by down-regulation of the receptor. Phosphotyrosine immunoblotting demonstrates rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR-GFP and a number of cellular proteins upon EGF stimulation (Fig. 2 C). The pattern of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of cellular proteins in response to EGF was similar to that in cells expressing wild-type EGFR (EGFR-wt), although small qualitative and quantitative differences were observed when various clones of NIH 3T3 cells expressing EGFR-GFP and EGFR-wt were compared. The level of EGFR-GFP and EGFR-wt phosphorylation is gradually decreased over the course of the 6-h experiment with the half-life of approximately 3 h. These data indicate the appropriate signaling capabilities of EGFR-GFP. Activation of MAP kinase (Erk1/2) is a trademark of EGF-induced signal transduction cascade (23Rossomando A.J. Payne D.M. Webber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6940-6943Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). To test whether EGFR-GFP is capable of mediating MAP kinase activation, lysates of NIH 3T3 cells expressing EGFR-GFP were probed with the antibodies specifically recognizing the activated MAP kinase. Fig. 3 B demonstrates substantial EGF-dependent activation of Erk1/2, which returns to a basal level within 2–6 h. The extent and time course of MAP kinase stimulation were essentially the same in cells expressing EGFR-GFP and wild-type EGFR (EGFR-wt) (data not shown). In cells treated with chloroquine MAP kinase remains maximally active during at least 6 h, which parallels the activity of EGFR-GFP (Fig. 3 B). Experiments presented in Figs. 2 and 3 suggest that the chimeric EGFR-GFP preserves functional activity. The initial EGF-induced events following receptor activation are mediated by interactions of the receptor carboxyl terminus with several proteins. For instance, the Shc adaptor protein (46- and 52 kDa forms) is a major receptor-binding partner in vivo involved in signaling of the EGFR (24Pelicci G. Lafrancone L. Grignane F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti N. Grignani F. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). The binding of Shc to EGFR requires phosphorylation of tyrosines 1148 and 1173 located near the fusion point in the EGFR-GFP chimera (25Soler C. Beguinot L. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12320-12324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of AP-2 to Tyr-974 is implicated in the regulation of receptor endocytosis (8Sorkin A. Mazzotti M. Sorkina T. Scotto L. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13377-13384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The ability of EGFR-GFP to interact with Shc and AP-2 was tested in NIH 3T3 cells using co-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig.4). Western blot analysis of receptor immunoprecipitates from EGFR-wt- and EGFR-GFP-expressing cells demonstrate similar levels of EGF-dependent association of α-adaptin, a marker of AP-2 complex, and both Shc p46 and p52 (p52 band obscured by IgG heavy chain, data not shown). These data strongly indicate the similar biochemical properties of the chimeric and native EGFR and together with Figs. 2 and 3 demonstrate that the GFP moiety does not affect the activity of EGFR. The decrease in the expression level of the receptor (down-regulation) is a characteristic feature of the effect of ligand activation of the EGFR and other receptor tyrosine kinases. Fig.5 A demonstrates EGF-dependent down-regulation of the receptor in NIH 3T3 cells expressing different levels of wt-EGFR or EGFR-GFP and in transiently transfected HEK 293 cells. In NIH 3T3 cells the number of EGF-binding sites at the surface in cells expressing EGFR-GFP or EGFR-wt is decreased at similar rates in the presence of EGF. Interestingly, when EGFR-GFP or EGFR-wt were transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells, EGF did not cause significant loss of the surface EGF-binding sites, whereas endogenous receptors in these cells are down-regulated very rapidly (Fig. 5 A). To measure specifically the degradation of the receptor protein, NIH 3T3 cells expressing EGFR-GFP were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and then treated for up to 4 h with EGF. Receptors were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with anti-EGFR. As shown in Fig. 5 B, EGF induces rapid degradation of EGFR-GFP with a half-life time of about 1.5 h. This value is in close agreement with the previously determined values for EGFR-wt expressed in NIH 3T3 cells (8Sorkin A. Mazzotti M. Sorkina T. Scotto L. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13377-13384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 20Sorkin A. Waters C.M. Overholser K.A. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8355-8362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The products of partial proteolysis of EGFR-GFP (Figs. 2 and 3) were not immunoprecipitated, probably due to a poor recognition of these truncated forms by the antibody 986 specific to the extracellular domain of native EGFR. The apparent rates of EGFR down-regulation and degradation are determined by the specific rates of several trafficking processes, including internalizatio"
https://openalex.org/W2061831711,"Bacterial lipopolysaccharide or endotoxin induces actin reorganization, increased paracellular permeability, and endothelial cell detachment from the underlying extracellular matrixin vitro. We studied the effect of endotoxin on transendothelial albumin flux and detachment of endothelial cells cultured on gelatin-impregnated filters. The endotoxin-induced changes in endothelial barrier function and detachment occurred at doses and times that were compatible with endotoxin-induced apoptosis. Since the actin cytoskeleton and cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion all participate in the regulation of the paracellular pathway and cell-matrix interactions, we studied whether protein components of the actin-linked adherens junctions were modified in response to endotoxin. Components of cell-cell (β- and γ-catenin) and cell-matrix (focal adhesion kinase and p130Cas) adherens junctions were cleaved by caspases activated during apoptosis with dose and time requirements that paralleled those seen for barrier dysfunction and detachment. Cleavage of focal adhesion kinase led to its dissociation from the focal adhesion-associated signaling protein, paxillin, resulting in reduced paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation. Inhibition of caspase-mediated cleavage of these proteins protected against detachment but not opening of the paracellular pathway. Therefore, endotoxin-induced disruption of endothelial monolayer integrity and survival signaling events is mediated, in part, through caspase cleavage of adherens junction proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1989846203,"Hallmarks of chronic inflammation and tissue fibrosis are increased influx of activated inflammatory cells, mediator release, and increased turnover and production of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Recent evidence has suggested that fragments of the ECM component hyaluronan play a role in chronic inflammation by inducing macrophage expression of chemokines. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ), an important regulator of macrophage functions, has been shown to induce the C-X-C chemokines Mig and IP-10. These chemokines affect T-cell recruitment and inhibit angiogenesis. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effect of hyaluronan (HA) on IFN-γ-induced Mig and IP-10 expression in mouse macrophages. We found a marked synergy between HA and IFN-γ on Mig and IP-10 mRNA and protein expression in mouse macrophages. This was most significant with Mig, which was not induced by HA alone. The synergy was specific for HA, was not dependent on new protein synthesis, was not mediated by tumor necrosis factor-α, was selective for Mig and IP-10, and occurred at the level of gene transcription.

In normal, healthy tissues, the ECM is composed of a complex array of proteins, proteoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans that play important roles in homeostasis (7Hidenori K. Raines E.W. Bornfeldt K.E.

During an inflammatory response, there is increased production and degradation of the ECM, resulting in the accumulation of breakdown products of ECM components such as fibronectin, collagen, and glycosaminoglycans (8Hance A.J. Crystal R.G. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1975; 112: 657-668PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, these lower molecular mass ECM components have been shown to have different biological activities compared with their larger, native precursors (9Clark R. Wikner N. Doherty D.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7147-7151Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Likewise, recent work from our laboratory and others has shown that low molecular weight fragments of the ECM glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA) may play a role in macrophage activation (13McKee C.

Invest. 1993; 91: 2368-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) HA is a ubiquitously distributed component of the ECM. In its native form, it exists as a high molecular weight nonsulfated glycosaminoglycan polymer (17Laurent T. Fraser J. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2070) Google Scholar, 18Lazaar A. Alvelda S. Pilewski J. Brennan B. Pure E. Panettieri R. J. Exp.

High molecular mass HA is believed to have many functions in healthy tissue, such as water homeostasis, plasma protein distribution, and matrix structuring (17Laurent T. Fraser J. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2070) Google Scholar). However, at sites of inflammation and tissue injury, there is an accumulation of lower molecular mass HA species (19Balazs E.A. Watson D. Duff I.F. Roseman S. Arthritis Rheum. 1967; 10: 357-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 20Bjermer L. Lundgren R. Hallgren R. Thorax. 1989; 44: 126-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 21Hallgren R.

Recent studies have suggested that these lower molecular weight forms of HA may stimulate macrophages recruited to sites of inflammation to produce important mediators of tissue injury and repair (13McKee C.

This effect is mediated, in part, by interaction with the HA receptor CD44 (13McKee C. Penno M. Cowman M. Burdick M. Strieter R. Bao C. Noble P. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2403-2413Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 14McKee C. Lowenstein C. Horton M. Wu J. Bao C. Chin B. Choi A. Noble P. J. Biol.

In the inflammatory milieu, there are numerous cytokines and chemokines that also influence macrophage expression of inflammatory genes. The cytokine IFN-γ is an important modulator of macrophage effector functions and regulator of the inflammatory response (22Gazzinielli R.T. Oswald I.P. James S.L. Shen A. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1752-1769Google Scholar). In addition to its antiviral activity, IFN-γ also enhances certain macrophage functions, such as microbicidal and tumoricidal activity, through the production of reactive oxygen intermediates and reactive nitrogen intermediates (23Flesch I. Hess J.H. Oswald I.P. Kaufmann S.H.E. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 24Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2204-2212PubMed Google Scholar). Yet despite its many proinflammatory roles, IFN-γ also inhibits macrophage expression of certain LPS-induced chemokines, such as monokine chemoattractive protein-1 and KC (24Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2204-2212PubMed Google Scholar). IFN-γ has recently been shown to induce macrophage expression of the novel chemokines monokine induced by interferon-γ (Mig) and interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) (25Vanguri P. Farber J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15049-15056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Farber J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5238-5242Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Both Mig and IP-10 are members of the C-X-C chemokine family and may play roles in chronic inflammation (27Narumi S. Tominaga Y. Tamaru M. Shimai S. Okmura H. Nishioji K. Itoh Y. Okanoue T. J.

In chronic infectious states, expression of Mig and IP-10 has been shown to correlate with IFN-γ expression (29Amichay D. Gazzinelli R. Karupiah G. Moench T. Sher A. Farber J. J. Immol. 1996; 157: 4511-4520PubMed Google Scholar). Mig and IP-10 have each been implicated in T-cell trafficking, chemotaxis, and activation (31Liao F. Rabin R.L. Yannelli J.R. Koniaris L.G.

IP-10 is induced in macrophages by α, β, and IFN-γ, as well as by LPS (25Vanguri P. Farber J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15049-15056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Luster A.D.

To date, Mig has only been shown to be induced in macrophages by IFN-γ (26Farber J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5238-5242Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 39Ebnet K. Simon M.M. Shaw S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 797: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recent investigations have described synergistic enhancement of IFN-γ-induced Mig and IP-10 expression by TNF-α in fibroblasts (40Ohmori Y. Hamilton T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6677-6688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Ohmori Y. Schreiber R. Hamilton T. J. Biol.

In this report, we examined the effect of low molecular mass HA fragments on IFN-γ-induced expression of Mig and IP-10. We observed a striking synergy between HA and IFN-γ on the expression of Mig and IP-10 mRNA and protein levels in murine macrophages that occurs at the level of gene transcription. These results identify a previously uncharacterized mechanism by which the ECM, acting in conjunction with IFN-γ, may regulate the immune response by influencing the expression of specific chemokines. The mouse alveolar macrophage cell line MH-S (42Mbawuike I. Herscowitz H. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1989; 46: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated low LPS fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin/1% glutamine (Biofluids, Rockville, MD) at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages were isolated, as described previously (16Noble P. Lake F. Henson P. Riches D. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2368-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), from female C3H/HeJ LPS hyporesponsive mice purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). After harvest, cells (11 × 106 cells/dish) were cultured for 5 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated low LPS fetal bovine serum, 15% l-cell media, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin/1% glutamine (Biofluids) at 37 °C under 8% CO2. Thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages were lavaged from female C3H/HeJ mice or TNF-α(−/−) mice (43Marino M. Dunn A. Grail D. Inglese M. Noguchi Y. Richards E. Jungbluth A. Wada H. Moore M. Williamson B. Basu S. Old L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8093-8098Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar) 4 days after injection of 2 ml of sterile thioglycollate (Sigma). The cells were allowed to adhere overnight in RMPI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated low LPS fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin/1% glutamine before use. To exclude effects of contaminating LPS on experimental conditions, cell stimulation was carried out in the presence of B 10 μg/ml polymixin (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). Purified HA fragments from human umbilical cords were purchased from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA). The HA-ICN preparation was free of protein (<2%) and other glycosaminoglycans with a peak molecular mass of 200,000 Da (44Lee T.H. Lee G.W. Ziff E.B. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1982-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Recombinant mouse IFN-γ (specific activity, 3.0 × 105 units/ml; endotoxin level less than 0.2 ng/mg) was from Genzyme Corporation (Cambridge, MA), the recombinant mouse TNF-α was purchased from R & D Systems, the anti-TNF-α was from Cappel (Aurora, OH), and the cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) was from Sigma. Polymixin B was purchased from Calbiochem. Stock solutions of reagents were tested for LPS contamination using the Limulus amebocyte assay (Sigma). RNA was extracted from confluent cell monolayers using 4 m guanidine isothiocyanate and purified by centrifugation through 5.7 mcesium chloride for 12–18 h at 35,000 rpm as described (16Noble P. Lake F. Henson P. Riches D. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2368-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Ten μg of total RNA was electrophoresed under denaturing conditions through a 1% formaldehyde-containing agarose gel and RNA was transferred to Nytran (Schleicher and Schuell) hybridization filters. Blots were briefly rinsed in 5× SSC, RNA was cross-linked to the filter by UV cross-linking (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and blots were hybridized overnight with 106 cpm/ml of 32P-labeled DNA labeled by the random prime method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Following hybridization, blots were washed once in 2× SSC/0.1% SDS at room temperature for 30 min with shaking, and then washed twice in 0.1× SSC/0.1% SDS at 50 °C with shaking for 20 min each wash. Blots were exposed at −70 °C against Kodak XAR diagnostic film. Differences in RNA loading were documented by hybridizing selected blots with 32P-labeled cDNA for aldolase (45Lokuta M. Maher J. Noe K. Pitha P. Shin M. Shin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13731-13738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Densitometric scanning was performed using a Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitometer SI (Sunnyvale, CA). Western blot analysis was performed as described (46Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1990; 347: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (2692) Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 μg of macrophage-conditioned media was fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10%), transferred to a nylon membrane, blocked and washed, incubated with the polyclonal anti-Mig antibody at a dilution of 1:2500 or polyclonal anti-crg-2 (murine IP-10 antibody from R & D Systems) at a dilution of 1:3000, and developed with a chemiluminescent system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The recombinant Mig protein was prepared as described previously (26Farber J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5238-5242Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), and the recombinant crg-2 (murine IP-10) was purchased from R & D Systems. Nuclei from confluent monolayers of MH-S cells were harvested by scraping in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently isolated by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion (47Greenberg M.E. Bender T.P. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Strull K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 4.10.1-4.10.11Google Scholar). Nuclei were then incubated for 30 min with 1 mdithiothreitol, 20 mm NTPs, and 100 μCi of [32P]UTP in transcription buffer. The nuclei received a cold UTP chase for 10 min before the reaction was stopped by the addition of termination buffer, DNase (Promega, Madison, WI) and RNase-Inhibitor (Boehringer Mannheim). The nuclei were then incubated with tRNA (Sigma) for 15 min before the addition of 10% SDS, 0.2m EDTA and proteinase K (Sigma). After 15 min of incubation, the RNA was extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol, precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid, washed with 5% trichloroacetic acid/5% PPi, dissolved in 0.1% SET, and precipitated for a second time with 4 m NaAc and 100% ETOH at −80 °C for 30 min. Purified radiolabeled RNA was washed once in 70% ETOH, dried with a speed vacuum concentrator (Savant), and resuspended in 100 μl of water. 5 μl of the radioactive RNA was counted, and all samples were normalized for counts using hybridization fluid. Normalized samples were hybridized with prehybridized Optitran-S membranes (Schleicher and Schuell) containing the cDNAs of interest. Blots were hybridized for 3–4 days and then washed once in 2× SSC/0.1% SDS at room temperature for 5 min with shaking, and then washed twice in 0.1× SSC/0.1% SDS at 50 °C with shaking (20 min each wash). The blots were then exposed and quantitated with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Transient transfections of the MH-S cells were performed using Lipofectin as described elsewhere (48Wright T.M. Farber J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2.5 × 106 cells were plated in 60-mm tissue culture dishes 1 day prior to transfection. The cells were washed twice with Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated with the DNA/Lipofectin solution (5 μg of DNA and 15 μg of Lipofectin) for 7 h. The DNA/Lipofectin solution was then aspirated, 3 ml of Opti-MEM was added, and the cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C. The contents of the dishes were scraped in 8 ml of fresh medium and divided between four 60-mm culture dishes. After incubation for 4 h to allow the cells to adhere, one dish from each transfection group received medium alone, one received HA (100 μg/ml), the third received IFN-γ alone (300 units/ml), and the last received HA + IFN-γ. The cells were harvested for analysis of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) expression after 18 h of stimulation. The −1117/+43 Mig/firefly luciferase, γRE-1 × 4 Mig/firefly luciferase, and −299/+7 IP-10/CAT construct were prepared as described previously (49Guyer N.B. Severns C.W. Wong P. Feghali C.A. Wright T.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3472-3480PubMed Google Scholar, 50Wong P. Severns C.W. Guyer N.B. Wright T.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 914-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). We investigated the effect of HA and IFN-γ on Mig and IP-10 mRNA expression by mouse macrophages. Mig and IP-10 were originally identified as being induced by IFN-γ stimulation of the mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 (25Vanguri P. Farber J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15049-15056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Farber J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5238-5242Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that HA fragments (200,000 Da) induce the expression of a number of inflammatory mediators, including several members of the chemokine family (MIP-1α, MIP-1β, IP-10, RANTES, monokine chemoattractive protein-1, IL-8, and KC), as well as the cytokines IL-1, TNF-α, IL-12, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (13McKee C. Penno M. Cowman M. Burdick M. Strieter R. Bao C. Noble P. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2403-2413Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 14McKee C. Lowenstein C. Horton M. Wu J. Bao C. Chin B. Choi A. Noble P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8013-8018Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 15Hodge-Dufour J. Noble P. Horton M.R. Bao C. Wysoka M. Burdick M.D. Strieter R.M. Trinchieri G. Puré E. J. Immunol. 1997; 15: 2492-2500Google Scholar, 16Noble P. Lake F. Henson P. Riches D. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2368-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent work from our laboratory has shown that IFN-γ selectively inhibits HA-induced MIP-1α and MIP-1β expression in primary mouse macrophages (51Horton M. Burdick M. Strieter R. Bao C. Noble P. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3023-3030PubMed Google Scholar). We were therefore interested in the possible role for low molecular mass HA in regulating Mig and IP-10 expression in the presence of IFN-γ. In order to assess the combined effect of HA and IFN-γ on Mig and IP-10 gene expression, macrophages were simultaneously stimulated with HA and IFN-γ for 6 h, mRNA was isolated, and Northern analysis was performed. As shown in Fig. 1 A, HA alone had virtually no effect on Mig or IP-10 mRNA expression in inflammatory thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages from C3H/HeJ-LPS hyporesponsive mice, whereas IFN-γ induced moderate expression of Mig and IP-10 mRNA. However, we unexpectedly found that HA dramatically influences the effect of IFN-γ on Mig and IP-10 mRNA expression (Fig. 1 A). Similar results were observed with MH-S cells, a murine alveolar macrophage cell line (Fig.1 B). In these alveolar macrophages, the synergy is most apparent for Mig where, in addition to no effect on Mig gene expression by HA alone, IFN-γ alone induced only a faint signal (Fig.1 B). However, the combination of HA and IFN-γ markedly induced Mig mRNA expression (Fig. 1 B). In this alveolar macrophage cell line, HA minimally induced IP-10 mRNA, and IFN-γ had a moderate effect on IP-10 mRNA, but there was still marked enhancement of IP-10 mRNA when cells were stimulated both with HA and IFN-γ (Fig. 1 B). To further delineate the effects of HA and IFN-γ on Mig and IP-10 mRNA expression, we stimulated MH-S cells simultaneously with HA and IFN-γ for varying time intervals and found that HA failed to independently induce Mig expression at any time point and only minimally induced IP-10 mRNA (data not shown). However, the synergistic effect of HA and IFN-γ on Mig and IP-10 mRNA expression was seen as early as 3 h after simultaneous stimulation of MH-S cells, peaked after 6–9 h, and decreased toward baseline after 24 h of stimulation (data not shown). We then determined the dose-response relationships for HA and IFN-γ to induce Mig and IP-10 gene expression in MH-S cells. The effect of varying concentrations of HA with a constant concentration of IFN-γ on Mig and IP-10 mRNA expression by the alveolar macrophage cell line MH-S is shown in Fig. 2 A. The synergy between HA and IFN-γ on Mig and IP-10 gene expression was observed with as little as 1 μg/ml HA and was maximal at 10 μg/ml HA in the presence of 300 units/ml IFN-γ. The converse is shown in Fig. 2 B using a concentration of 100 μg/ml HA. The synergy between HA and IFN-γ occurs with as little as 1 unit/ml IFN-γ and is maximal at 10 units/ml IFN-γ. In order to determine whether the synergy between HA and IFN-γ was specific to low molecular mass HA fragments, we stimulated MH-S cells in the presence of IFN-γ and numerous other glycosaminoglycans. Fig.3 shows that IFN-γ only synergizes with HA fragments and not high molecular mass HA, chondroitin sulfate A or B, or HA disaccharides to induce Mig or IP-10 mRNA expression. Thus, the synergy between HA and IFN-γ on Mig and IP-10 gene expression in MH-S cells appears to be specific to the low molecular mass HA fragments. Having identified the synergistic effect between HA and IFN-γ on Mig and IP-10 mRNA levels, we investigated Mig and IP-10 production at the protein level. MH-S cells were simultaneously stimulated with HA in the presence of IFN-γ for 20 h. Mig protein secretion was determined in the supernatants by Western blot analysis. Fig. 4 A shows that there was little Mig protein present in the conditioned media from unstimulated cells or cells stimulated with HA or IFN-γ alone. However, when the macrophages were stimulated with HA and IFN-γ together, there was marked induction of Mig protein production in the conditioned media. Fig. 4 B shows similar synergistic induction of IP-10 protein production by MH-S cells stimulated with both HA and IFN-γ. However, unlike Mig, there was some IP-10 protein induced by HA and IFN-γ alone. Thus, the synergy between HA and IFN-γ is also demonstrated at the protein level. In order to further dissect the mechanism for the observed synergy, we examined the role of new protein synthesis on the synergy between HA and IFN-γ on Mig and IP-10 mRNA expression in MH-S cells. We pretreated MH-S cells with cycloheximide (CHX) for 30 min before the addition of HA and IFN-γ for 6 h. As shown in Fig.5, CHX minimally inhibited the synergistic expression of Mig and IP-10 mRNA by HA and IFN-γ. Similarly, CHX had no effect on Mig or IP-10 gene expression from unstimulated cells or cells stimulated with HA alone, and it had little effect on cells stimulated with IFN-γ alone (Fig. 5). Thus, the synergistic induction of Mig and IP-10 gene expression by HA and IFN-γ does not appear to require new protein synthesis. Recently, Ohmori et al. (40Ohmori Y. Hamilton T. J. Biol.

Here we show that the phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain within the N-terminal transforming region of Cbl (Cbl-N) binds to phosphorylated Tyr323in the linker region between the Src homology 2 and kinase domains of Syk, confirming recent results by another laboratory using the yeast two-hybrid approach (Deckert, M., Elly, C., Altman, A., and Liu, Y. C. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 8867–8874). A PTB domain-inactivating point mutation (G306E), corresponding to a loss-of-function mutation in the Caenorhabditis elegans Cbl homologue SLI-1, severely compromised Cbl-N/Syk binding in vitro and Cbl/Syk association in transfected COS-7 cells. Using heterologous expression in COS-7 cells, we investigated the role of Cbl PTB domain binding to Syk Tyr323 in the negative regulation of Syk. Co-expression of Cbl with Syk in COS-7 cells led to a dose-dependent decrease in the autophosphorylated pool of Syk and in phosphorylation of an in vivo substrate, CD8-ζ. Unexpectedly, these effects were largely due to the loss of Syk protein. Both the decrease in Syk and CD8-ζ phosphorylation and reduction in Syk protein levels were blocked by either G306E mutation in Cbl or by Y323F mutation in Syk. These results demonstrate a critical role for the Cbl PTB domain in the recruitment of Cbl to Syk and in Cbl-mediated negative regulation of Syk.

Studies over the last 4 years have now firmly established that Cbl, the product of the c-cbl proto-oncogene, is a component of early tyrosine kinase signaling cascades in a variety of cell types (reviewed in Refs. 1Lupher Jr., M.L.

For example, Cbl is an early and prominent target of tyrosine phosphorylation in response to activation of a number of cell surface receptors coupled to tyrosine kinase activation, including the lymphocyte antigen receptors, cytokine receptors, and growth factor receptors (1Lupher Jr., M.L.

Finally, we showed that the transforming N-terminal region of Cbl (Cbl-N, equivalent to Cbl sequences present in the v-cbloncogene) harbors a phosphotyrosine-binding domain that selectively and directly interacts with the T cell tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 (6Lupher Jr., M.L.

Subsequently, this domain was also shown to mediate binding to receptor tyrosine kinases EGFR and PDGFRα (1Lupher Jr., M.L. Andoniou C.E. Bonita D.P. Miyake S. Band H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 2Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Andoniou C.E. Lill N.L. Ota S. Douillard P. Rao N. Band H. Crit. Rev.

While these associations have promoted the notion that Cbl functions as a complex adapter protein that couples tyrosine kinases to downstream signaling pathways, a number of recent biochemical and genetic studies have identified Cbl as a potential negative regulator of Syk/ZAP-70, as well as other PTKs (1Lupher Jr., M.L. Andoniou C.E. Bonita D.P. Miyake S. Band H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 2Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Andoniou C.E. Lill N.L. Ota S. Douillard P. Rao N. Band H. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1998; 8: 189-218Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The C. elegans homologue of Cbl, SLI-1, was identified through a genetic screen as a negative regulator of the LET-23 receptor tyrosine kinase, a homologue of the mammalian EGFR, which functions in the vulval development (11Yoon C.H. Lee J.H. Jongeward G.D. Sternberg P.W. Science. 1995; 269: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Notably, the loss of function mutations in SLI-1 were mapped to the evolutionarily conserved N-terminal region, corresponding to the PTB domain. One of these was a point mutation (G315E); the analogous mutation in mammalian Cbl-N abrogated its PTB domain activity (6Lupher Jr., M.L. Reedquist K.A. Miyake S. Langdon W.Y. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24063-24068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Recently, a Drosophila Cbl homologue (D-Cbl) was identified and also shown to function as a negative regulator of the Drosophila EGFR-mediated R7 photoreceptor development (12Meisner H. Daga A.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2709-2719Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Dominant oncogenic forms of mammalian Cbl introduced into NIH-3T3 cells induced an up-regulation of signaling downstream of the endogenous PDGFRα tyrosine kinase (8Bonita D.P. Miyake S. Lupher M.L. Langdon W.Y. Band H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4597-4610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and resulted in enhanced autophosphorylation of a transfected human EGFR (10Thien C.B.F. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2239-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Conversely, overexpression of wild type Cbl in NIH-3T3 cells reduced the autophosphorylation of a transfected human EGFR, while an antisense Cbl construct had the opposite effect (14Ueno H. Sasaki K. Miyagawa K. Honda H. Mitani K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8739-8743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Finally, co-expression of Cbl and Syk in RBL-2H3 mast cells led to a down-regulation of Syk autophosphorylation and kinase activity, and inhibition of histamine release following FcεR1 ligation (15Ota Y. Samelson L.E. Science. 1997; 276: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Consistent with the role of Cbl as a negative regulator of tyrosine kinases, ablation of the murine cblgene was recently shown to result in tissue hyperplasia and increased signaling through the ZAP-70 kinase (16Murphy M.A. Schnall R.G. Venter D.J. Barnett L. Bertoncello I. Thien C.F. Langdon W.Y. Bowtell D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4872-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The ability of Cbl to function as a tyrosine kinase regulator has heightened the need to determine the nature of its physical and functional interactions with this class of enzymes. Studies in our laboratory and others have focused on the interactions of Cbl with the Syk/ZAP-70 family of tyrosine kinases, critical elements in cellular activation through antigen receptors. Cbl was shown to associate with Syk and ZAP-70 in lymphocytes activated, respectively, through the B cell receptor or T cell receptor (17Fournel M. Davidson D. Weil R. Veillette A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 18Panchamoorthy G. Fukazawa T. Miyake S. Soltoff S. Reedquist K. Druker B. Shoelson S. Cantley L. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3187-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Notably, Cbl/Syk association was also observed in a myeloid leukemic cell line and in RBL-2H3 mast cells overexpressing Syk and Cbl; however, significant Cbl/Syk association was observed prior to FcγR or FcεR1 ligation (19Marcilla A. Rivero-Lezcano O.M. Agarwal A. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9115-9120Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 20Ota Y. Beitz L.O. Scharenberg A.M. Donovan J.A. Kinet J.P. Samelson L.E. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1713-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Cbl was shown to serve as a substrate for Syk or ZAP-70 when co-expressed with these proteins in COS cells (21Latour S. Chow L.M.L. Veillette A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22782-22790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) or when Syk was expressed as the cytoplasmic tail of an IgFv-Syk chimera in a T cell hybridoma (22Fitzer-Attas C.J. Schindler D.G. Waks T. Eshhar Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8551-8557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of physical interaction between Cbl and ZAP-70/Syk PTKs have begun to be addressed recently. We found that Tyr(P)292 in ZAP-70, a negative regulatory phosphorylation site, mediated binding to Cbl's PTB domain, and both an intact Cbl PTB domain and ZAP-70 Tyr292 were required for stable association in a COS cell system (7Lupher Jr., M.L. Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Cantley L.C. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33140-33144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, it is not known if Cbl negatively regulates ZAP-70 by binding to Tyr(P)292. While the association of Syk with Cbl has been observed in several distinct cell types, the mechanism of Cbl/Syk interaction is controversial. Using Cbl truncation mutants, Ota et al. (20Ota Y. Beitz L.O. Scharenberg A.M. Donovan J.A. Kinet J.P. Samelson L.E. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1713-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) suggested that Cbl/Syk association involves the proline-rich region on Cbl and the non-kinase regions of Syk. However, since Syk does not possess an obvious proline-rich peptide-binding domain (such as an SH3 domain) in its N-terminal regions, it became apparent that Cbl/Syk association either was mediated via an adapter molecule or involved other mechanisms. In view of the critical role of the Cbl PTB domain in binding to a linker region phosphotyrosine residue (Tyr(P)292) in ZAP-70 (7Lupher Jr., M.L. Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Cantley L.C. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33140-33144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and the apparently important role for the PTB domain in Cbl's direct association with other tyrosine kinases (1Lupher Jr., M.L. Andoniou C.E. Bonita D.P. Miyake S. Band H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 2Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Andoniou C.E. Lill N.L. Ota S. Douillard P. Rao N. Band H. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1998; 8: 189-218Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we investigated whether this mechanism also plays a role in the Cbl/Syk interaction. In this study, we demonstrate that the Cbl PTB domain plays a major role in mediating physical interaction between Syk and Cbl, and we identify Syk Tyr(P)323 as the major binding site for the Cbl PTB domain. These results confirm the recent conclusions of Deckertet al. (23Deckert M. Elly C. Altman A. Liu Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8867-8874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), which were based on yeast two-hybrid experiments. Importantly, we demonstrate that Cbl PTB domain interaction with the Syk Tyr(P)323 is critical for Cbl-induced negative regulation of Syk.

For this purpose, lysates were prepared from Ramos human B cells that were either left unstimulated or were stimulated with an anti-IgM antibody for 10 min. These lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads coated with GST, GST-Cbl-N, or GST-Cbl-N-G306E fusion protein. Bound polypeptides were resolved by SDS-PAGE along with control or anti-Syk immunoprecipitates prepared from the same lysates, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and immunoblotted with anti-Tyr(P) and anti-Syk antibodies (Fig. 1 A). A 72-kDa phosphotyrosyl polypeptide was the most prominent band observed in GST-Cbl-N binding reactions (Fig. 1 A,lanes 3 and 4, upper part), and this band comigrated with directly immunoprecipitated tyrosine-phosphorylated Syk (lanes 9 and 10, upper part). Reprobing of the blot identified the 72-kDa polypeptide as Syk (lanes 3 and 4, lower part). These analyses show that Syk specifically binds to GST-Cbl-N, as no signal was observed in GST binding reactions (lanes 1 and 2, upper andlower parts). Binding of Cbl-N to Syk in lysates of unstimulated cells was low, but it increased substantially upon anti-IgM stimulation of the cells (compare lanes 3 and 4). Importantly, a PTB domain-inactivating point mutation in Cbl-N (Cbl-N-G306E) completely abrogated binding to Syk (lanes 5 and 6, upperand lower parts). Notably, while the amount of Syk protein bound to Cbl-N was modest, the phosphotyrosine signal was substantial when compared with directly immunoprecipitated Syk (comparelanes 4 and 10, upper part). In addition, the amount of Syk bound to Cbl-N in lysates varied with the time of stimulation of cells prior to lysis (Fig. 1 B). This binding closely paralleled the level of Syk tyrosine phosphorylation observed in lysates and anti-Syk immunoprecipitations (data not shown). These results establish that Cbl-N interacts with Syk in a lysate-binding assay. However, it was possible that this interaction was indirectly mediated by an adapter molecule. To determine if the Cbl PTB domain directly bound to Syk, a far Western blot was performed. Anti-Syk immunoprecipitations were carried out using lysates of anti-IgM-activated Ramos cells; proteins were resolved by"

F., Pommier, Y., and Hogan, M. E. (1997)Biochemistry36, 12498–12505). To understand that observation and to rationalize the generally high thermal stability of oligonucleotide folding for these compounds, we have used NMR methods, coupled to molecular modeling, to obtain a high resolution structure model for T30695, which is the most potent of the integrase inhibitors that have been identified thus far. Modeling and NMR data obtained in the presence of Li+ ions show that T30695 assumes an intramolecular fold with a distorted G-octet core and a set of three open, partially disordered loops. This is referred to as Li+-form structure. The NMR-based model suggests that, upon coordination with three K+ equivalents, the central G-octet becomes more regular and that the loop domains become orderly and compact. This is referred to as K+-form structure. Based upon the assay of inhibition of HIV-1 integrase, T30695 demonstrated a strong inhibition of HIV-1 integrase activity as the K+-form structure, but a poor inhibition of HIV-1 integrase activity as the Li+-form structure. The structure/activity analysis suggests that the K+-induced conformation transition of the tetrad-forming oligonucleotides, such as T30695 andT30177, plays a key role in inhibition of HIV-1 integrase activity.

Skalka A.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 133-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). As the only enzyme required for HIV-1 integration, integrase catalyzes the insertion of HIV-1 viral DNA into the host genome in a two-step reaction. First, integrase cleaves two nucleotides from the 3′-end of the linear proviral DNA. Then, upon binding to the proviral duplex, integrase catalyzes the covalent coupling of the cleaved 3′-end to a site of the host chromosome, which had been nicked by the integrase (1Katz R.A.

Since it is critical to HIV-1 viral replication, integrase has become an attractive target for selective anti-HIV therapies. Pharmaceutical inhibition of HIV-1 integration has been reported for 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine (4Mazumder A. Cooney D. Agbaria R. Gupta M. Pommier Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 21635-21638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of the candidates mentioned above had an IC50 in the micromolar range for inhibition of the strand transfer or the terminal exonuclease activity, which is too high to be of general utility.Recently, a new class of oligonucleotides was developed to be an inhibitor of HIV-1 integrase (9Rando R.F. Ojwang J. Elbaggari A. Reyes G.R. Tinder R. McGrath M.S. Hogan M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1754-1760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The most potent anti-HIV-1 oligonucleotide in this oligomer family was reported to be a 17-mer (T30177), 5′-g*tggtgggtgggtggg*t, synthesized with two phosphorothioate linkages (one at each end). According to preliminary physical analysis, it was proposed that T30177 formed an intramolecular G-quartet structure (9Rando R.F. Ojwang J. Elbaggari A. Reyes G.R. Tinder R. McGrath M.S. Hogan M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1754-1760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Previously, it had been shown that T30177 can inhibit both the activity of HIV-1 integrase with IC50 values in the 50 nm range (10Mazumder A. Neamati N. Ojwang J.O. Sunder S. Rando R.F. Pommier Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13762-13771Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).Based upon T30177, a 16-residue oligonucleotide, T30695, 5′-g*ggtgggtgggtggg*t, was designed in order to improve both the structural stability and the inhibition of HIV-1 integrase activity (11Jing N. Rando R.F. Pommier Y. Hogan M.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12498-12505Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Thermal denaturation analysis demonstrated that T30695 folded into an extremely stable intramolecular G-quartet structure in the presence of K+. Compared with T30177, the melting temperature of T30695 was substantially increased. In the presence of K+, T30695 folded into a stable G-quartet structure as a two-step process as follows: the first being a fast, higher affinity ion binding process, apparently at the central pair of G-quartets; the second being localized to the loop domains to yield two additional lower affinity ion binding sites. Recent NMR results support the two-step binding model: the first step saturating at about a 1:1 ratio of T30695 to K+, and the second step saturating at about a ratio of 1:3 (12Jing N. Gao X. Rando R.F. Hogan M.E. J. Biomol. Struct. & Dyn. 1997; 15: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It was also proposed that K+ binding to the loop domains of T30695 induced a structural rearrangement, in which loop bases were oriented parallel to the bases of the G-quartet core (Fig. 1). By using a standard gel-based integrase assay, IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) values for inhibition of HIV-1 integrase by T30695 were determined. The values for the 3′-processing and strand transfer steps were 43 and 24 nm, respectively, and about 70 nm for inhibition of HIV-1 proliferation in culture (11Jing N. Rando R.F. Pommier Y. Hogan M.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12498-12505Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Compared with T30695 with three T-G loops and one T-G pseudo loop at its terminus, a closely related homologue, referred to as thrombin-binding aptamer (TBA), also forms an intramolecular G-quartet structure with two T-T loops and one T-G-T loop (13Wang K.Y. McCurdy S. Shea R.G. Swaminathan S. Bolton P.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1899-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 14Schultze P. Macaya R.F. Feigan J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1532-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). Based upon previous observations (11Jing N. Rando R.F. Pommier Y. Hogan M.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12498-12505Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), the subtle changes in the loop structure substantially decrease their thermal stability, ion binding interaction, and anti-HIV-1 activity.In order to explore the effect of loop structure on structure and activity, in the present report we have calculated an NMR-derived molecular structure for T30695 in the absence and presence of K+ and measured K+-induced folding kinetics ofT30695, T30177, and TBA. IC50 values for the anti-HIV-1 integrase activities of T30695, T30177, and TBA were obtained in open and closed structure states (Fig. 1 C), and the tests were performed commercially at the Southern Research Institute. Based upon the IC50 values of T30695, T30177, and TBA in the different structure states, it has been concluded that the K+-induced conformational transition mediated by orderly folding of the loops ofT30695 and T30177 plays a key role in inhibition of HIV-1 integrase activity.RESULTSBased on solution state NMR, we have obtained a structural model for T30695 in the absence and presence of K+ ions. This study is a direct extension of one- and two-dimensional NMR measurements described previously (12Jing N. Gao X. Rando R.F. Hogan M.E. J. Biomol. Struct. & Dyn. 1997; 15: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The assignments of non-exchangeable proton resonances and exchangeable proton resonances for T30695 were obtained from NOESY and 1H–31P COSY. In previous studies, we demonstrated that in the presence of Li+ ions, T30695 forms an unimolecular tetrad structure stabilized by a pair of G-quartets. Upon addition of K+ions up to 3 equivalents, K+ ions were found to coordinate tightly with T30695 and to induce a second conformational transition (Fig. 1 C) (12Jing N. Gao X. Rando R.F. Hogan M.E. J. Biomol. Struct. & Dyn. 1997; 15: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We also provided preliminary NMR data to suggest that the K+binding induced folding of the loop bases onto the planar face of the underlying G-quartets. In the present study, we have calculated NOE distance constraints from the NMR data, and we have used the NOE constraints to obtain a higher resolution structural model for T30695in the absence of K+ ion (open form) and in the presence of K+ ion (the closed form of the intramolecular fold).NMR ConstraintsFor NOESY measurements with T30695 in the absence of K+, 346 NOE cross-peaks were observed, including 37 inter-residue NOEs. The NOE cross-peaks between base H8 and H1′ protons play a key role in the determination of G-quartet structure since they can be used to establish χ angles for the bases. Strong H8–H1′ NOEs were observed for residues G2, G6, G10, and G14, from which we conclude that they assume the syn-conformation in the central G-octet (20Feigon J. Koshilap K.M. Smith F.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 261: 225-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Weak NOE peaks between G2H8-G3H1′, G6H8-G7H1′, G10H8-G11H1′, and G14H8-G15H1′ and medium NOEs between G11H8-G10H1′ and G15H8-G14H1′ are consistent with an anti-conformation for those bases. Thus, in the absence of K+, T30695 appears to assume a standard alternatingsyn-anti-syn-anti G-quartet conformation. This conformation has been observed for other intra- and inter-molecular G-quartets, most notably the analogous intra-molecular G-quartet that has been studied by Feigon and colleagues (20Feigon J. Koshilap K.M. Smith F.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 261: 225-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). According to the NOE-based analysis of G-quartet structure (20Feigon J. Koshilap K.M. Smith F.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 261: 225-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), the NOEs observed between GnH8 and GnH2′, H2“ (for all 8 G residues in the G-quartets) also match the syn-anti-syn-anti G-quartet structure for the central core.96 NOEs (27%) have been assigned to the 8-loop residues of the T30695fold. The 11 weak inter-residue NOE connections in the loops, T4H6-G13H1′, T12H6-G13H1′, T8H6-G1H1′, and TnH6-Gn+1H2′, H2“ (n = 4, 8, 12, 16), have been used in modeling to constrain the orientation of the loop residues of T30695 in the absence of K+ ions.After adding K+ to T30695 in 20 mmLi3PO4, a conformational transition can be detected by NMR in the loop domains (Fig.2 and Ref. 12Jing N. Gao X. Rando R.F. Hogan M.E. J. Biomol. Struct. & Dyn. 1997; 15: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Sixteen new NOE cross-peaks of the amino and imino protons were observed between a loop and neighboring quartet residues. These cross-peaks were not found in the spectra without K+. This suggests that in the absence of K+, the loop residues are open and more dynamic; the separation of the imino and amino protons between a loop and neighbor quartet residues is greater than the maximum NOE-detectable distance. As seen in Fig. 2, the NOE peaks of the imino protons, GnH1-Gn+1H1 (n = 1, 5, 9, 13), and TmH1-Gm−1H1 (m = 4, 8, 12, 16), provide evidence that the bases of the loop residues, upon binding K+, fold into an alignment that is parallel to the G-quartet bases. In the presence of K+ ions, new NOEs between T methyl and G H8 protons were also observed in loop residues in the spectra of T30695 (Fig. 3). These additional constraints suggest a nearly planar fold for the loops (Fig.1 E). Comparison of the NOESY spectrum of T30695 in the presence of K+ with that in the absence of K+suggests that the G-quartet and backbone conformation remains unchanged upon binding the 3 eq of the K+ ion (Ref. 12Jing N. Gao X. Rando R.F. Hogan M.E. J. Biomol. Struct. & Dyn. 1997; 15: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar and data not shown). Upon binding K+ ions, the formation of imino proton H bonds between loop T and G residues (Fig. 1 E) is supported by the large increase in the T1 relaxation times and downfield chemical shifts for exchangeable loop protons (12Jing N. Gao X. Rando R.F. Hogan M.E. J. Biomol. Struct. & Dyn. 1997; 15: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The longer T1 values may result from residues in a more rigid orientation, which are constrained by hydrogen binding, base-base stacking, and K+ ion concentration. These additional H bond constraints were included in the calculation of the molecular structure of T30695 in the presence of K+ ions.Figure 2NOESY (τm = 200 ms) spectrum ofT30695 in 10 mm KCl and H2O (90%), D2O (10%) using jump and return water suppression.Data are presented for the exchangeable protons in the H-bonding domain of the NOESY spectrum. NOEs between loop T imino and Gqimino protons, T mH1-Gm−1H1 (m = 4, 8, 12, 16), and between loop G imino and Gq imino protons GnH1-Gn+1H1 (n = 1, 5, 9, 13) were only observed in the presence of K+ ions, all of which gives significant evidence for the K+-induced loop folding.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3The NOESY (τm = 200 ms) spectrum ofT30695 between loop residues from T methyl to G H8 protons observed in the presence of K + ions.

The details of the protocol for processing NOE data and the calculation of the molecular structures are described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig.4 shows stereo views of superimposed structures obtained in the refinement of the T30695 structure in the absence of K+ (Li+ form, Fig. 1 C). This family of equivalent structure models reveals a pair of distended G-quartets in the central core flanked by unfolded loops. Convergence was verified by examining the constraint energy and violation list. As seen in Fig. 5 A, the plot of r.m.s.d. (root mean square deviation) for this structure set shows a reasonable convergence for the G-quartets and a larger deviation for the loop residues. The average r.m.s.d. values of the residues in the pair of G-quartets and in the loops are 1.09 ± 0.28 and 1.44 ± 0.56 Å, respectively. Therefore, the positions of the bases within the G-quartets are well determined. However, the bases of the loop residues appear to be more variable (in the absence of K+ions), matching a suggestion made previously (11Jing N. Rando R.F. Pommier Y. Hogan M.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12498-12505Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 12Jing N. Gao X. Rando R.F. Hogan M.E. J. Biomol. Struct. & Dyn. 1997; 15: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). TheR-factor per residue for the refined structure of T30695 in the absence of K+ was calculated by Equation 1. R=[∑​(AX6−AT6)2]1/2/∑​(AX6),Equation 1 where AX6 = ‖A exp‖1/6 and AT6 = ‖A theo‖1/6. The value of theR-factor per residue is about 0.028 ± 0.014 as shown in Fig. 5 B.Figure 4A superimposed stereo view of five refined structures of T30695 in the absence of K + (Li + -form structure).

After binding three K+ ions, the structure of T30695 is composed of a central-most pair of G-quartets, and the loop bases are aligned so that they lie roughly parallel to the G-quartet bases (Fig. 6 and7). This structure is more compact and symmetrical than the structure of T30695 in the absence of K+. The distance between the two central G-quartet planes is calculated to be 3.9 ± 0.2 Å, which is in agreement with values seen for G-quartet in crystals (21Kang C. Zhang X. Ratliff R. Moyzis R. Rich A. Nature. 1992; 356: 126-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). The average distance of the bases between the residues of Gn to T,+3(n = 1, 5, 9, 13) is approximately 13–15 Å. Since the loops of T30695 fold into symmetrical and nearly identical positions, the width of two ends of the octet is about the same in this calculated structure and is approximately 14–16 Å apart. The bases of the t-g loop domains fold into an irregular planar configuration at the top and bottom of the pair of G-quartets and are calculated to be in direct coordination with two additional K+ ions. Each of the T methyl groups is pointed out of the folded plane, which is required by the measured NOEs between T methyl and G H8 protons of the loop residues (Fig. 1 E). The convergence of a set of molecular structures of T30695 in the presence of K+ ions becomes more homogeneous. The average r.m.s.d. values of the residues in the pair of G-quartets and in the loops are 0.71 ± 0.18 and 0.87 ± 0.29 Å, respectively.Figure 6The molecular structure of T30695 in the presence of K + (K + -form structure).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 7The molecular structure of T30695 in the presence of K+ (K+-form structure) displaying the position of the three bound K+ equivalents (see text for details).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Inhibition of HIV-1 IntegrasePrevious work has shown thatT30695 and T30177 are both potent HIV-1 inhibitors, but TBA has a poor ability to inhibit HIV-1 integrase (11Jing N. Rando R.F. Pommier Y. Hogan M.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12498-12505Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In a gel-based assay, IC50 values of T30695, T30177, and TBA reported by our collaborators (11Jing N. Rando R.F. Pommier Y. Hogan M.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12498-12505Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) are about 43, 79, and 870 nm for inhibition of HIV-1 integrase 3′-processing and about 24, 49, and 750 nm for inhibition of HIV-1 integrase strand-transfer, respectively. Here we measured IC50 values of T30695,T30177, and TBA in two different sample conditions as follows: (i) the oligomers in 20 mm Li3PO4, pH 7, were prepared in 10 mm KCl, then diluted into 1 mm KCl as a test concentration, and (ii) the oligomers in 20 mm Li3PO4, pH 7, were prepared in H2O and test IC50 values without adding KCl. The measurements of the IC50 values of T30695, T30177, and TBA with and without K+ in the final reaction buffer were carried out in the same assay process, which was performed commercially by Southern Research Institute.As seen in Fig. 8, we found that 50% inhibition of HIV-1 integrase activity by T30695 delivered in a buffer without K+ corresponds to about 530 nm strand concentration (Fig. 8 A, line b). The inhibition by T30695delivered in 10 mm KCl is about 31 nm strand concentration (Fig. 8 A, line a), 17 times lower than the data obtained in the absence of K+ ion. The same phenomenon was also observed for T30177 (Fig. 8 B, lines a andb). The IC50 value of T30177 delivered in 10 mm KCl is about 18 times lower than that in H2O (Table I). However, IC50values of TBA with and without K+ are found to be similar as 470 and 790 nm, respectively (Fig. 8 C, lines a and b), in agreement with a generally K+-independent aptamer folder (14Schultze P. Macaya R.F. Feigan J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1532-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). As demonstrated above,T30695 forms different molecular structures (K+ form and Li+ form) in the presence and absence of K+(Figs. 4 and 7). Thus the data in Fig. 8 suggest that the two structures differ greatly in the ability to inhibit HIV-1 integrase.Figure 8The IC50 values of T30695(A), T30177 (B), and TBA (C) obtained from the SPA anti-HIV assay were presented as percentage of activity of HIV-1 integrase versusconcentration of these oligomers. Each oligomer was tested in two sample conditions as follows: 1) oligomer in 20 mmLi3PO4 in 10 mm KCl (line a), and 2) oligomer in 20 mmLi3PO4 in H2O (line b), by the same assay process. IC50 values of T30695, T30177, and TBA in 10 mm KCl are 31, 26, and 470 nm, and IC50 values of T30695, T30177, and TBA in H2O are 530, 480, and 790 nm, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table IThe inhibition of HIV-1 integrase activityOligomers5′-Sequence-3′IC50 (nm) 10 mm KClIC50 (nm) H2O (with Li+T30695GGGTGGGTGGGTGGGT31530T30177GTGGTGGGTGGGTGGGT26480TBAGGTTGGTGTGGTTGG470790 Open table in a new tab Kinetics of K+-induced Structural TransitionIn order to further investigate the relation between molecular structure and anti-HIV activity, we measured the kinetics of oligomer folding forT30695, T30177, and TBA using 7 μm strand concentration in 20 mm Li3PO4 buffer at 25 °C. Folding kinetics were obtained by manual addition of K+ at time 0 and measured with UV absorbance at 264 nm in the 0–300-s time range. Since the plots of UV absorption versus time forT30695 and T30177 showed a two-step process (Fig.9, A and B), the data were analyzed by a simple two-step transitional model:A (t) =A o[exp(−t/τ2) −f·exp(−t/τ1)], whereA o = Cεl, C is total concentration of oligomer, ε is the extinction coefficient of oligomer sequence, l is path length, and f is fitting constant.Figure 9K + ions were added to oligomers in 20 mm Li3PO4 assay buffer at time 0. Plots were presented by absorbanceversus time after addition of K+ ions. Kinetics were measured at added KCl concentrations for T30695: 0.02 mm (A) and 10.0 mm (D), at added KCl concentrations for T30177; 1.0 mm(B) and 10.0 mm (E), and added KCl concentration for TBA; 1.0 mm (C) and 10.0 mm (E). The data have been fitted by a sum of two exponentials: A (t) = A o[exp(−t/τ2) −f·exp(−t/τ1)], and the folding time constants, τ1 and τ2, were obtained from these curve fittings.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)After adding K+ ions in T30695 and T30177 to 0.02 and 1.0 mm, respectively, the intensity of the UV absorption was found to vary with time. As seen in Fig. 9, A andB, the folding process as a function of time has two components. The time constant of the first component (τ1) of T30695 is 8.0 s and that of T30177 is 20.2 s. This component is fast and hyperchromic, and based upon conclusions drawn previously from NMR-based titration (12Jing N. Gao X. Rando R.F. Hogan M.E. J. Biomol. Struct. & Dyn. 1997; 15: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), it is induced by a K+ ion competing with a Li+ ion for binding between the two G-quartets. It appears that in this step, the bases of the two central G-quartets are rearranged into two more regular parallel plates. The second component (τ2) is slow and hypochromic, indicating a net increase in base stacking, consistent with NMR data that suggests that the loop bases become folded parallel to the bases of the underlying G-quartet by binding two additional K+ between the loops and G-quartets (12Jing N. Gao X. Rando R.F. Hogan M.E. J. Biomol. Struct. & Dyn. 1997; 15: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7). When K+ was increased to 10 mm, τ1 was almost too fast to be detected by the apparatus, and τ2becomes much faster (Fig. 9, D and E). τ2 of T30695 decreased from 2.4 × 104 s (Fig. 9 A) to 30 s (Fig. 9 D) and of T30177decreased from 2.4 × 104 s (Fig. 9 B) to 50 s (Fig. 9 E). Thus, the overall folding process ofT30695 and T30177 is mainly determined by the time constant (τ2) of second component, loop rearrangement. The folding process of TBA in 1.0 mm KCl was observed to be a one-step process (τ1 = 101 s) (Fig. 9 C). When K+ concentration was increased to 10 mm, the first step becomes too fast to detect, and no second step was observed (Fig. 9, C and F). It is clear that there is only one step in the K+-driven folding process for TBA since only one K+ is bound into the G-quartet of TBA.DISCUSSIONIn an earlier study (9Rando R.F. Ojwang J. Elbaggari A. Reyes G.R. Tinder R. McGrath M.S. Hogan M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1754-1760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) we provided evidence to suggest that the 17-mer oligonucleotide T30177 folded intramolecularly to form a structure stabilized by a pair of G-quartets (Fig. 1). We previously noticed that the T30177 fold is significantly more stable with respect to thermal denaturation (9Rando R.F. Ojwang J. Elbaggari A. Reyes G.R. Tinder R. McGrath M.S. Hogan M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1754-1760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) than the folded structure of a closely related oligonucleotide, the so-called thrombin binding aptamer (TBA), which had also been shown to form an intramolecular fold stabilized by a single pair of G-tetrads (13Wang K.Y. McCurdy S. Shea R.G. Swaminathan S. Bolton P.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1899-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 14Schultze P. Macaya R.F. Feigan J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1532-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). To explain that striking difference (the T m for T30177 is about 30 ° higher), we proposed that the loop domains of T30177 bind with metal ions, especially K+, to yield two additional quartet-like base pairings within the loops (Fig. 1 C). Based upon that low resolution model, we had concluded that the quality of those additional loop interactions and, consequently, the thermodynamic stability of the fold might be additionally improved by elimination of a single base to yield the 16-mer T30695 (11Jing N. Rando R.F. Pommier Y. Hogan M.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12498-12505Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). That predicted stability increase was shown to be correct, which conferred general credibili"

Mice lacking Nkx2–5 still form a beating linear heart tube, in which most myogenic genes are expressed, but the mice die due to defective heart looping (9Lyons I. Parsons L.M. Hartley L. Li R.

Ectopic expression of Nkx2–5 in frog and zebrafish embryos results in an enlarged myocardium, suggesting that Nkx2–5 recruits additional cells into the heart from the heart morphogenetic field (12Chen J.N.

The MEF2 family of transcription factors has been shown to play a critical role in the cell type-specific transcription of genes in cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle cells (14Molkentin J.D.

A. 1996; 93: 9366-9373Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). They contain a conserved MADS box/MEF2 domain at their N termini, which is both necessary and sufficient for dimerization and DNA binding to an AT-rich MEF2 binding site. Drosophila lacking the single D-mef2gene are deficient in cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle development, indicating an essential role for D-MEF2 in the development of these tissues (22Lilly B.

However, mice lacking MEF2B showed no phenotype, whereas mice lacking MEF2C were deficient in cardiac looping, dying around embryonic day 10 (25Lin Q. Schwarz J. Bucana C. Olson E.N. Science. 1997; 276: 1404-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Consequently, the role of MEF2 family members in murine muscle development is more difficult to assess due to possible functional redundancy. Promoter analysis has shown that MEF2 sites mediate the expression of several muscle-specific genes in cardiac muscle, including cardiac myosin light chain 2, cardiac troponin T, muscle creatine kinase, and α-myosin heavy chain (26Iannello R.C.

The first MEF2 family member to be expressed during mouse development is MEF2C, which is found on embryonic day 7.5 in cells of the cardiac mesoderm (30Edmondson D.G. Lyons G.E. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Development. 1994; 120: 1251-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice lacking MEF2C were deficient in the expression of a subset of cardiac specific genes, including atrial natriuretic factor, cardiac α-actin, α-myosin heavy chain, and the basic helix-loop-helix factor dHAND. However, other cardiac muscle genes such as MLC2v andMLC2a were expressed normally (25Lin Q. Schwarz J. Bucana C. Olson E.N. Science. 1997; 276: 1404-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Since MEF2B was up-regulated in MEF2C mutant mice, it is likely that MEF2B may partially substitute for MEF2C activity. The ability of MEF2 family members to induce muscle development in tissue culture is controversial. One study documented that MEF2A initiates skeletal myogenesis in fibroblasts (31Kaushal S. Schneider J.W. Nadal-Ginard B. Mahdavi V. Science. 1994; 266: 1236-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), but these results were not confirmed by others (32Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). The zinc finger transcription factor GATA-4 also plays a key role in cardiac muscle development (3Mohun T. Sparrow D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 628-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 33Fishman M.C. Chien K.R. Development. 1997; 124: 2099-2117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Evans T. Trends Cardiovasc.

GATA-4 is expressed in the precardiac mesoderm at 7.5 days postcoitum and in the endocardial and myocardial layers of the heart tube (35Heikinheimo M. Scandrett J.M. Wilson D.B. Dev. Biol. 1994; 164: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). GATA-4 can regulate a number of cardiac structural genes, such as α-myosin heavy chain, cardiac troponin-C, atrial natriuretic factor, and brain natriuretic peptide (36Grepin C. Dagnino L.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5687-5696Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Mice lacking GATA-4 develop cardiomyocytes, which express cardiac muscle-specific genes. However, these mice die early due to defective morphogenetic movements required for the formation of the linear cardiac tube (41Molkentin J.D. Lin Q. Duncan S.A. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1061-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar, 42Kuo C.T. Morrisey E.E. Anandappa R. Sigrist K. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Soudais C. Leiden J.M.

We have analyzed the ability of both Nkx2–5 and MEF2C to activate endogenous cardiac muscle-specific gene expression in murine P19 embryonal carcinoma cells. The differentiation of these pluripotent stem cells is initiated by cellular aggregation in the presence of differentiating agents and emulates the biochemical and morphological processes that occur during early embryonic development (43McBurney M.W. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1993; 37: 135-140PubMed Google Scholar, 44Rudnicki M.A. McBurney M.W. Robertson E.J. Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach.

McBurney M.W. Development. 1994; 120: 115-122PubMed Google Scholar), but few of the cells continue to differentiate. P19 cells treated with retinoic acid differentiate into various neuroectodermal derivatives, including neurons, astrocytes, and glia (44Rudnicki M.A. McBurney M.W. Robertson E.J. Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 19-49Google Scholar, 46Jones-Villeneuve E.M. McBurney M.W. Rogers K.A. Kalnins V.I. J.

Saito T. Anderson D.J. Development. 1992; 114: 75-87PubMed Google Scholar) and MEF2C (16Black B.L. Ligon K.L. Zhang Y. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26659-26663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), which can physically interact to synergistically activate transcription. P19 cells aggregated in the presence of Me2SO may differentiate into cardiac and skeletal muscle along with other mesodermal and endodermal cell types (48Edwards M.K. Harris J.F. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 2280-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The resulting cardiomyocytes are embryonic in nature and first appear at day 6 following Me2SO treatment. Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis has shown that GATA-4 is first expressed on day 3 of differentiation and is followed by Nkx2–5 on day 4 of differentiation (49Grepin C. Nemer G. Nemer M. Development. 1997; 124: 2387-2395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MEF2C appears to be expressed constitutively but is up-regulated at day 6. The rationale for examining the ability of stem cells to differentiate in the presence of exogenous transcription factors is to provide the factor of interest with an environment similar to that of the developing embryo. Therefore, the presence or absence of tissue-restricted components within the host cells does not limit the function of the transcription factor. In addition, sufficient material can be obtained for subsequent analysis. For example, P19 cells overexpressing either GATA-4 (49Grepin C. Nemer G. Nemer M. Development. 1997; 124: 2387-2395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or MyoD (50Skerjanc I.S. Slack R.S. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 1464: 8451-8459Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar) differentiate into cardiac muscle or skeletal muscle, respectively, when aggregated in the absence of Me2SO. Using this model system, we report that both Nkx2–5 and MEF2C initiated the development of cardiac muscle when overexpressed in cells aggregated in the absence of Me2SO. The DNA construct PGK-MEF2C contains the phosphoglycerate kinase (pgk-1) promoter (51Adra C.N. Boer P.H. McBurney M.W. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 60: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) driving the coding region of human MEF2C (20Leifer D. Krainc D. Yu Y.T. McDermott J. Breitbart R.E. Heng J. Neve R.L.

The construct PGK-Nkx2–5 contains thepgk-1 promoter driving a 1.6-kb EcoRI fragment containing the complete open reading frame of mouse Nkx2–5 cDNA (5Lints T.J. Parsons L.M. Hartley L. Lyons I. Harvey R.P. Development. 1993; 119: 419-431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The construct PGK-Puro contains the pgk-1 promoter driving the gene encoding puromycin resistance, as described (50Skerjanc I.S. Slack R.S. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 1464: 8451-8459Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The construct PGK-LacZ contains the pgk-1 promoter driving the gene encoding β-galactosidase. PGK-vector DNA is a plasmid containing the pgk-1 promoter alone. P19 embryonal carcinoma cells were cultured as described (44Rudnicki M.A. McBurney M.W. Robertson E.J. Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 19-49Google Scholar) with the modification that 5% Cosmic calf serum (HyClone, Logan, Utah) and 5% fetal bovine serum (CanSera, Rexdale, Ontario, Canada) were used to supplement the α-minimal essential medium. Stable cell lines expressing Nkx2–5 (5Lints T.J. Parsons L.M. Hartley L. Lyons I. Harvey R.P. Development. 1993; 119: 419-431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were isolated following transfection of P19 cells with 8 μg of PGK-Nkx2–5, 2.5 μg of B17 (52McBurney M.W. Fournier S. Schmidt-Kastner P.K. Jardine K. Craig J. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1994; 20: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), 1 μg of PGK-LacZ, and 1 μg of PGK-Puro, as described previously (50Skerjanc I.S. Slack R.S. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 1464: 8451-8459Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Control P19 cells were isolated by transfection with the same complement of plasmids except that the 8 μg of PGK-Nkx2–5 plasmid was replaced by PGK-vector DNA. Cells were selected for 1 week in 2 μg/ml puromycin. Three cell lines that expressed high levels of Nkx2–5 were termed P19(Nkx2–5) cells. Transfected cells expressing low levels of Nkx2–5 behaved similarly to P19 cells and were not pursued further. Stable cell lines expressing MEF2C were isolated in a similar fashion to P19(Nkx2–5) cells. P19 cells were transfected with 6.5 μg of a plasmid containing PGK-MEF2C or 6.5 μg of PGK-vector alone, 2.5 μg of B17, 1 μg of PGK-LacZ, and 1 μg of PGK-Puro. All experiments reported were performed at least twice with at least two cell lines, with similar results.

P19, P19(Nkx2–5), and P19(MEF2C) cells were plated on day 4 of differentiation onto gelatin coated coverslips. For identifying myosin heavy chain (53Bader D. Masaki T. Fischman D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar), cells were fixed in methanol at −20 °C and reacted with antibody as described (50Skerjanc I.S. Slack R.S. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 1464: 8451-8459Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence was visualized with a Zeiss Axioskop microscope. Images were captured with a Sony 3CCD color video camera; processed using Northern Exposure, Adobe photoshop, and Corel Draw software; and printed with a dye sublimation phaser 450 Tektronic printer. Total RNA was isolated by the lithium chloride/urea extraction method, and 6 μg were examined by Northern blot analysis as described previously (50Skerjanc I.S. Slack R.S. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell.

Averages and S.E. values were calculated and reported. Total cellular RNA was extracted with TRIzol Reagent according to the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) and treated with DNase I, amplification grade, at a concentration of 1 unit/μg RNA. The first strand cDNA synthesis was performed using Superscript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer (Life Technologies) with 1 μg of total RNA. PlatinumTaq DNA Polymerase (Life Technologies) was used to perform the PCR with 25 cycles: 94 °C for 1 min, 55–72 °C for 2 min, depending on the melting temperature of the primers, and 72 °C for 2 min. The amount of first strand reaction added to the PCR was titrated for each set of primers, and the quantity used was chosen in the middle of the linear range. Products were detected by Southern blot analysis with a probe from the corresponding cDNA. Negative controls performed with all RT-PCR experiments included a water control for the PCR and a water control for the complete RT-PCR. RNA was examined for genomic contamination after the DNase treatment by performing the RT-PCR in the absence of Superscript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase. The following pairs of primers were used: 5′-tccatccacgtcggccaggct-3′ and 5′-gtagggctcaaccacagcagt-3′ for tubulin, with an annealing temperature of 61 °C; 5′-actctggaggcgagatggg-3′ and 5′-ctcggcattacgacgccacag-3′ for GATA-4 (41Molkentin J.D.

In order to examine the activity of Nkx2–5 in the context of differentiating stem cells, three P19 cell lines that stably express high levels of Nkx2–5 were isolated and termed P19(Nkx2–5) cells. These cells continued to express the stem cell marker Oct-3 (60Okamoto K. Okazawa H. Okuda A. Sakai M. Muramatsu M. Hamada H. Cell. 1990; 60: 461-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar) when grown as monolayer cultures, indicating that they retain a stem cell phenotype (data not shown) similar to that observed for P19(MyoD) cells (50Skerjanc I.S. Slack R.S. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 1464: 8451-8459Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To examine whether expression of Nkx2–5 in P19 cells can induce differentiation into cardiac muscle, P19 and P19(Nkx2–5) cells were aggregated for 4 days without Me2SO and fixed on day 6. The amount of cardiac muscle was quantitated by counting cardiomyocytes in cultures that were stained by immunofluorescence with the anti-myosin heavy chain antibody, MF20 (53Bader D. Masaki T. Fischman D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Aggregation of P19(Nkx2–5) cells in the absence of Me2SO resulted in the differentiation of abundant cardiac muscle (30–60% of total cells, Table I). This is demonstrated by the presence of cardiomyocytes expressing myosin heavy chain in P19(Nkx2–5) cells (Fig. 1 D), compared with control cell cultures (Fig. 1 B).Table IComparison of the cell types produced after aggregation of various P19 cell linesCell line and sourceDifferentiated cell types producedDrug requirementExtent of differentiated cell typeTime required for differentiation%daysP19(MEF2C) (this report)CardiacNone1.5–3aThe percentage of differentiated cells was calculated by dividing the total number of cardiomyocytes counted in 15 representative fields by the total number of cells, estimated from counting Hoechst-stained nuclei, for at least two cell lines in at least two experiments.6P19(Nkx2–5) (this report)CardiacNone30–60aThe percentage of differentiated cells was calculated by dividing the total number of cardiomyocytes counted in 15 representative fields by the total number of cells, estimated from counting Hoechst-stained nuclei, for at least two cell lines in at least two experiments.6P19(MyoD) (50Skerjanc I.S.

Open table in a new tab Total mRNA was isolated from P19 and P19(Nkx2–5) cultures on days 0 and 6 of differentiation in the absence of Me2SO and subjected to Northern blot analysis. High levels of Nkx2–5 were expressed on both day 0 and day 6 in P19(Nkx2–5) cultures (Fig.2 A, lanes 3–8) but not in P19 control cultures (Fig. 2 A,lanes 1 and 2). The formation of abundant Nkx2–5-induced cardiac muscle is indicated by high levels of cardiac α-actin expression present on day 6 of differentiation in P19(Nkx2–5) cultures (Fig. 2 B, lanes 4, 6, 8) but not in P19 control cultures (Fig. 2 B, lane 2). The MEF2 family of transcription factors has been shown to bind MEF2 sites present in muscle-specific genes and activate their expression (14Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9366-9373Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The expression patterns of the four MEF2 family members were examined in P19 and P19(Nkx2–5) cultures aggregated in the absence of Me2SO. Of the four factors, only MEF2C demonstrated a 9 ± 3-fold increase in expression (n = 3) in P19(Nkx2–5) cultures on day 6 (Fig. 2 E, lanes 4, 6, and 8), compared with P19 control cultures (Fig. 2 E, lane 2). MEF2A showed a slight 0.32 ± 0.07-fold increase (n = 3) in the expression of the upper transcript on day 6 compared with day 0 in P19(Nkx2–5) cultures (Fig. 2 C,lanes 4,"

Previously we have shown that a mutant p47PHOX containing a single alanine mutation at Ser-379 is unable to translocate to the membrane, resulting in a loss of enzyme activity. This serine has been shown to be phosphorylated in wild type p47PHOX, albeit to a very low level (11Faust L.P. El Benna J. Babior B.M. Chanock S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Its phosphorylation, however, is not necessary for the remaining serines to be phosphorylated either in vivo orin vitro (12El Benna J. Faust L.P. Johnson J.L. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6374-6378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). During earlier studies using several p47PHOX mutants containing an alanine instead of a serine at a single potential phosphorylation site, we showed that no individual serine phosphate was required for the phosphorylation of the remaining serines to take place, although, as discussed above, Ser-379 is necessary for enzyme activity (11Faust L.P. El Benna J. Babior B.M. Chanock S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In this study we investigate the effect of double mutations involving serines 359 and 370 on the phosphorylation of p47PHOX and the activity of the leukocyte NADPH oxidase. Cloning of the plasmid constructs used in the transfection experiments was performed by standard techniques (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The mutant constructs S359A/S370A, S359D/S370D, and S359E/S370E were generated by a two-step polymerase chain reaction method using an appropriate mutant oligonucleotide to make the desired mutation (Table I). The polymerase chain reaction-generated fragments were subsequently substituted into the EBOpLPP-based expression vector containing the wild type p47PHOX cDNA. The mutant construct S310–348A was created by single strand mutagenesis of the EBOpLPP-based expression vector as described previously using primers listed in Table I (11Faust L.P. El Benna J. Babior B.M. Chanock S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The mutant construct S359K/S370K was generated from the EBOpLPP wild type vector using the Chameleon mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions and using the mutant oligonucleotides listed in Table I. The sequence of all mutant constructs was confirmed by dideoxynucleotide-based sequencing (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

El Benna J. Scott K.E. Christensen B.L. Chanock S.J. Babior B.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2907-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose as described elsewhere (15Park J.-W. El Benna J. Scott K.E. Christensen B.L. Chanock S.J. Babior B.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2907-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Excess glutathione was removed from the solution of purified recombinant protein by dialysis against relaxation buffer (100 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 3.5 mmMgCl2, and 10 mm Pipes, pH 8.0), and the protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad assay kit with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Leukocyte NADPH oxidase activity was measured by chemiluminescence. Assays using whole cells were carried out as described elsewhere (16Thrasher A. Chetty M. Casimir C. Segal A.W. Blood. 1992; 80: 1125-1129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that 3 × 106 cells and 5 IU horseradish peroxidase were used in a final volume of 0.35 ml. The cell suspensions were placed in a 96-well microtiter plate, warmed to 37 °C, then activated at the same temperature with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, 1 μg/ml). Chemiluminescence was then measured at 45-s intervals using a Luminoskan luminometer (Labsystems Research, Finland) at 37 °C. For measuring leukocyte NADPH oxidase activity in a cell-free system, reaction mixtures contained 1.6 × 106 cell eq of neutrophil membranes, 106 cell eq of lymphoblast cytosol (prepared by sonicating a suspension of lymphoblasts in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline for three 10-s intervals at 4° C and then removing particles by centrifugation for 15 min at the same temperature in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge), 160 μm NADPH, 1 mm luminol, 5 IU horseradish peroxidase, and relaxation buffer in a final volume of 0.35 ml. The enzyme was activated by the addition of 90 μm SDS, and chemiluminescence was measured at 10-s intervals using a Luminoskan luminometer at room temperature. Recombinant p47PHOX was prepared and labeled as described previously (17Park J.-W. Babior B.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8484Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In brief, WT or mutant recombinant p47PHOX (2 μg) was labeled at room temperature for 20 min with 2 μCi of [3H]NEM in the presence or absence of 100 μm arachidonate. The samples were then placed on ice for 5 min before precipitating the labeled protein by the addition of 50% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 10%. Transfer RNA (250 μg) was added as a carrier. The samples were incubated on ice for 10 min and then centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pelleted proteins were suspended in 100 μl of H2O and were assayed in a liquid scintillation counter after the addition of water-compatible scintillation fluid. Transfected lymphoblasts were treated for 15 min at 4 °C with diisopropylfluorophosphate as described elsewhere (18Crowley C.A. Curnutte J.T. Rosin R.E. Andre-Schwartz J. Gallin J.I. Klempner M. Snyderman R. Southwick F.S. Stossel T.P. Babior B.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1980; 302: 1163-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The cells were then washed, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (108 cells/ml), and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. PMA (1 μg/ml) was then added to half the cells, and the incubation was continued for a further 12 min. The cells were then resuspended in 2 ml of ice-cold relaxation buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mm ATP, 1.5 mm EGTA containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml pepstatin, and 25 μg/ml aprotinin. Further procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The cells were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation (400 pounds/square inch for 5 min) and centrifuged (400 ×g, 10 min) to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was further centrifuged (100,000 × g, 45 min) to separate membranes from cytosol. The membrane pellet was washed once in the antiproteinase-fortified relaxation buffer and then suspended in Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 3 min. Transfected lymphoblasts and control cells were suspended at 2.5 × 107 cells/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, sonicated for three 10-s intervals, and centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge. An equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer was then added to the supernatant, and the proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. The separated proteins were then electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose, and the p47PHOX bands were visualized using a 1:20,000 dilution of a partially purified rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a C-terminal decapeptide from p47PHOX as described elsewhere (19Park J.-W. Ma M. Ruedi J.M. Smith R.M. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17327-17332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression was measured by densitometry with a Zeinieh laser scanner, determining quantities of p47PHOX from peak heights. Transfected p47PHOX—deficient B lymphoblasts expressing wild type or mutant p47PHOX were incubated overnight at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mm glutamine, 0.1% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) (106 cells/ml). The cells were then transferred to fresh medium containing 32Pi (0.2 mCi/ml) and incubated for an additional 4 h at 37 °C. The cells were activated for 20 min with PMA (1 μg/ml), after which their p47PHOX was isolated and purified by immunoaffinity chromatography as described previously (7El Benna J. Faust L.P. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23431-23436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Labeling of p47PHOX with rat brain protein kinase C (Calbiochem) was performed by incubating a reaction mixture containing 1 μg of recombinant p47PHOX, 0.1 μg of protein kinase C, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mmATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 0.5 mmCaCl2, 50 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, and 5 μg/ml diolein in a total volume of 30 μl for 30 min at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 4× SDS sample buffer, and the proteins were then resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel according to the method of Laemmli (20Cleveland D.W. Fischer S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography, and the32P was quantified by excising the bands from the dried gel and measuring their radioactivity using Čerenkov counting. A piece of gel of similar size was also excised from a32P-free portion of the gel and counted. This background value was subtracted from the other measurements. Previously it has been shown that a p47PHOX double replacement of serine with alanine at Ser-303 and Ser-304 of p47PHOX abolished the activation of the leukocyte NADPH oxidase, but this activity was restored by replacing the alanines with glutamate or lysine (21Inanami O. Johnson J.L. McAdara J.K. El Benna J. Faust L.P. Newburger P.E. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9539-9543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The negatively charged glutamate residues are postulated to mimic the effect of serine phosphorylation (22Hurley J.H. Dean A.M. Sohl J.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. Stroud R.M. Science. 1990; 249: 1012-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, the fact that the double mutant S303K/S304K was also active suggests either that the effect of phosphorylation is related to the increase in hydrophilicity around serines 303 and 304 or that activation involves the formation of a metal bridge between the phosphorylated serines and another region of the protein. Here we report a similar loss in oxidase activation in p47PHOX-deficient B cells expressing the double mutant p47PHOX S359A/S370A (Fig. 1). In this case, however, oxidase activity was not restored by replacing the alanines with negatively charged glutamate or aspartate or the positively charged lysine (see Fig. 1, p47PHOX S359E/S370E, p47PHOX S359D/S370D, p47PHOX S359K/S370K, respectively). Also reported here is the activity of the quintuple mutant p47PHOX S310A/S348A, in which serines Ser-310, Ser-315, Ser-320, Ser-345, and Ser-348 were changed to alanines. Upon stimulation with PMA, p47PHOX-deficient B lymphocytes expressing this mutant demonstrated >60% of the oxidase activity of cells expressing WT p47PHOX, suggesting that these serines are not essential for oxidase activity. This result concurs with the previously reported observations that the double mutants p47PHOX S345A/S348A (11Faust L.P. El Benna J. Babior B.M. Chanock S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and p47PHOX S320A/S315A (21Inanami O. Johnson J.L. McAdara J.K. El Benna J. Faust L.P. Newburger P.E. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9539-9543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) have no effect on oxidase activation. The failure of oxidase activation in p47PHOX-deficient B cells expressing the 359,370 double mutants was not due to a deficiency in the expression of these mutants, as their levels of expression were found to be approximately equal to that of the wild type protein (Fig.2 and Table II). Furthermore, this loss of activity did not appear to be due to an inability of the mutant proteins to fold into a functional conformation during biosynthesis. First, cytosols from lymphocytes expressing the 359,370 double mutants were tested in a cell-free oxidase system activated with SDS and were found to support oxidase activity to the same extent as wild type p47PHOX (Fig.3). Second, a covalent labeling method developed recently to assess changes in conformation of p47PHOXduring activation (17Park J.-W. Babior B.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8484Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) also confirmed that the mutant protein S359A/S370A achieved normal conformation (Table III). This method exploits the fact that a conformational change that occurs during oxidase activation alters the accessibility of cysteine 378 to [3H]NEM labeling. Wild type and mutant S359A/S370A recombinant protein were found to label to the same extent with [3H]NEM, and activation with arachidonate resulted in similarly reduced levels of labeling. We therefore suggest that the mutant proteins can achieve active conformations despite the changes in their amino acid sequences.Table IIExpression of p47PHOX in p47PHOX-deficient B cells transfected with plasmids expressing WT and mutant recombinant p47PHOXp47PHOXWT control%WT100S359A/S370A88.6 ± 8.0S359D/S370D94.9 ± 9.4S359E/S370E75.3 ± 15.1S359K/S370K101.2 ± 5.2S310A/S348A93.4 ± 7.8These densitometry measurements represent the mean ± S.D. of three separate experiments.

The results shown are from three separate experiments, each conducted in duplicate. The WT controls contained 14,500 ± 3,210 S.D. cpm of tritium. It is well established that the activation of the leukocyte NADPH oxidase is accompanied by the transfer of p47PHOX (and thus p67PHOX) to the plasma membrane, where it associates with cytochrome b 558 (2Heyworth P.G. Curnutte J.T. Nauseef W.M. Volpp B.D. Pearson D.W. Rosen H. Clark R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 23Rotrosen D. Kleinberg M.E. Nunoi H. Leto T. Gallin J.I. Malech H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8745-8750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether serine residues 359 and 370 are important for this translocation, we prepared plasma membranes from p47PHOX-deficient B cells expressing wild type or 359,370 double mutant forms of p47PHOXbefore and after activation with PMA. Immunoblot analysis of these membranes showed that mutant p47PHOX S359A/S370A and p47PHOX S359K/S370K were unable to translocate to the membrane, although the transfer of p47PHOX S359D/S370D and p47PHOX S359E/S370E appeared to be normal (Fig.4 and Table IV). These results suggest that the introduction of a negative charge (achieved here by the substitution of the alanines with aspartate or glutamate residues) may be required for the translocation of p47PHOX. It has previously been suggested that the membrane-binding site of p47PHOX may be concealed in resting cells, at least in part by an interaction involving the protein's highly basic C-terminal tail, whose positive charges could associate with a concentration of negative charge elsewhere on the surface of the molecule (11Faust L.P. El Benna J. Babior B.M. Chanock S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Introduction of a negative charge, by either serine phosphorylation or the replacement of serine by a negatively charged residue such as the glutamate or aspartate substitutions described here, could neutralize the positive charge, thus releasing the tail and exposing the membrane-binding site to allow assembly of the oxidase. The translocation results described here do appear to concur with this hypothesis, as the negatively charged residues allow translocation whereas the positively charged lysine residue does not facilitate the transfer of p47PHOX to the membraneTable IVTranslocation of p47PHOX to the membrane in PMA-activated p47PHOX-deficient B cells expressing WT and mutant recombinant p47PHOXp47PHOXWT control%WT100S359A/S370A0.0 ± 0.1S359D/S370D90.7 ± 3.8S359E/S370E103.8 ± 6.0S359K/S370K0.0 ± 0.1These densitometry measurements represent the mean ± S.D. of three separate experiments.

To ascertain the importance of serines 359 and 370 for the phosphorylation of p47PHOX, we phosphorylated GST fusion proteins of wild type and mutant p47PHOX. The results (Fig.5 and Table V) showed that there was a dramatic reduction in the level of phosphorylation of p47PHOXS359A/S370A as compared with the wild type and the other mutant forms of p47PHOX. It appears that the presence of the negatively charged residues at positions 359 and 370 allows extensive phosphorylation of p47PHOX, in contrast to the greatly reduced level of phosphorylation in the alanine mutant p47PHOXS359A/S370A. As with translocation, the negatively charged amino acids mimic the effect of the wild type with respect to phosphorylation.Table VIn vitro phosphorlyation of WT and mutant forms of recombinant GST-p47PHOXp47PHOXWT control%WT100S359A/S370A17.1 ± 3.3S359D/S370D63.1 ± 3.4S359E/S370E63.3 ± 4.7S303A/S304A67.4 ± 0.6S303D/S304D62.0 ± 0.4S303E/S304E67.0 ± 1.6The labeled bands were excised from the gel, and the radioactivity was measured by Čerenkov counting.

Direct evidence that the phosphorylation of p47PHOX is required for oxidase activity has been obtained using cell-free systems, the most recent showing activation with phosphorylated p47PHOX(30Cox J.A. Jeng A.Y. Sharkey N.A. Blumberg P.M. Tauber A.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 31El Benna J. Park J.-W. Ruedi J.M. Babior B.M. Blood Cells Mol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11035-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As discussed earlier, Ser-379 is known to be essential for oxidase activation. However, since the level of phosphorylation of this serine is very low (11Faust L.P. El Benna J. Babior B.M. Chanock S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), the role played by its phosphorylation in oxidase activation is inconclusive. The present study has further demonstrated a direct correlation between the phosphorylation of p47PHOX and oxidase activation. The Ser → Ala and Ser → Lys mutations of residues 359 and 370 in p47PHOX S359A/S370A and p47PHOX S359K/S370K, respectively, essentially abolish the phosphorylation of p47PHOX and prevent its translocation to the membrane, thereby blocking oxidase activity after PMA stimulation. Both translocation and phosphorylation of p47PHOX were restored by replacing the alanine residues with the negatively charged residues glutamate or aspartate, but oxidase activation in the S359D/S370D and S359E/S370E mutants still failed. It appears that there are two separate requirements for the serine at 359 or 370. First, a serine phosphate at one of these positions is absolutely required for oxidase activation to take place. A simple negative charge will not fulfill this requirement, as Asp and Glu mutations did not reconstitute activity. Second, a serine phosphate at one of these positions is required for translocation and for phosphorylation of the remaining serines. This requirement may reflect the need for a negative charge, as the substitution of the serine with glutamate or aspartate was able to return phosphorylation and translocation to wild type levels. As discussed earlier, the mutation of the p47PHOX serines 303 and 304 to alanines had no effect on the phosphorylation of the remaining serines but abolished oxidase activity. The activity was reconstituted, however, with glutamate or lysine substitutions in positions 303 and 304 (21Inanami O. Johnson J.L. McAdara J.K. El Benna J. Faust L.P. Newburger P.E. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9539-9543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Conversely, although glutamate or aspartate substitutions in positions 359 and 370 allowed partial functioning of p47PHOX, since further phosphorylation and translocation of the mutants p47PHOX S359D/S370D and S359E/S370E were normal, it is not easy to explain the failure of the Ala → Asp or Ala → Glu mutations at positions 359 or 370 to support oxidase activation. The results for the double mutant p47PHOX S359K/S370K, however, suggest that the partial function of mutants S359D/S370D and S359E/S370E is not due to a change in polarity or the formation of a metal bridge, as in the case of S303E/S304E, but, in fact, is due to neutralization of the positive charge of the highly basic C terminus tail as previously suggested. In either case, we propose that a membrane-binding site is exposed allowing assembly of the active oxidase. In summary, our observations suggest that p47PHOX requires at least three serines for oxidase activation as follows: a serine at position 379 that is essential for oxidase activity and translocation but not for phosphorylation of the remaining serines (11Faust L.P.

We conclude that with respect to p47PHOX, the activation of the leukocyte NADPH oxidase involves the following steps: 1) phosphorylation of Ser-359 and/or Ser-370; 2a) translocation of the partly phosphorylated subunit to the membrane; 2b) phosphorylation of Ser-303 and/or Ser-304, completing the activation of p47PHOX. The order of steps 2a and 2b can be reversed, but the phosphorylation of Ser-359 or Ser-370 is an obligatory first step for the participation of p47PHOX in the activation of the oxidase. Whether phosphorylation of Ser-379 is required for oxidase activity remains under investigation."

Using differential display, we identified the cDNA of a novel gene, designated retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RAIG1), which was induced by ATRA in the squamous carcinoma cell line UMSCC-22B. Two RAIG1 transcripts of 2.4 and 6.8 kilobase pairs, respectively, have the same ORF that encodes a 357-amino acid polypeptide. RAIG1 mRNA is expressed at high level in fetal and adult lung tissues. Induction of RAIG1 expression by ATRA is rapid (within 2 h) and dose-dependent in the range between 1 nm to 1 μm. The constitutive RAIG1 mRNA levels, which were low in three of five head and neck and four of six lung cancer cell lines, increased after ATRA treatment in most cell lines. The deduced RAIG1 protein sequence contains seven transmembrane domains, characteristic of G protein-coupled receptors. A fusion protein of RAIG1 and the green fluorescent protein was localized in the cell surface membrane and perinuclear vesicles in transiently transfected cells.

A number of co-factors have been found to interact with nuclear receptors and modulate their transcriptional activity. Co-activators are thought to serve as bridging molecules between the receptors and components of the basic transcriptional machinery, thus mediating activation of transcription (11Onate S.A.

Only a few of these genes can potentially mediate retinoid signaling for modulation of cell growth (1Love J.M. Gudas L.J. Curr. Opin.

Raven Press, New York, NY1994Google Scholar).The mechanisms through which retinoids suppress carcinogenesis are not well understood. However, it is thought that nuclear receptors play an important role in this mechanism (1Love J.M. Gudas L.J. Curr. Opin.

In vitrostudies have shown that retinoids inhibit cell proliferation and suppress squamous cell differentiation in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines (18Zou C-P. Clifford J.L. Xu X-C. Sacks P.G. Chambon P. Hong W.K. Lotan R. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5479-5487PubMed Google Scholar). Human oral squamous carcinoma cell UMSCC-22B is sensitive to ATRA in a clonogenic assay (19Jetten A.M. Kim J.S. Sacks P.G. Rearick J.I. Lotan D. Hong W.K. Lotan R. Int. J.

To better understand molecular events in retinoid-induced cell growth inhibition and differentiation, we use the differential display technique (21Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4688) Google Scholar) to identify retinoic acid-regulated genes in UMSCC-22B cells. Here, we present the cDNA of a novel retinoic acid-responsive gene, retinoic acid-induced gene 1 (RAIG1), which encodes a putative guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptor. Our results suggest that retinoids may exert biological function through interaction with a yet to be defined G-protein signaling pathway.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we cloned and characterized the cDNA of a novel retinoic acid-responsive gene, RAIG1, from UMSCC-22B cells. A unique feature of RAIG1 is the presence of two mRNA species, which presumably results from alternative utilization of different polyadenylation signals. There are four potential poly(A) signals in the primary transcript unit of RAIG1, of which only the first and the last are used in 3′ end RNA polyadenylation/cleavage reaction. In many occasions, RNA processing involves a selection among multiple polyadenylation sites (33Wahle E. Kuhn U. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 57: 41-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Polyadenylation signals can be strong or weak relative to one another, depending on their surrounding sequence context (34Edwalds-Gilbert G. Veraldi K.L. Milcarek C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2547-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The relative stable ratios between the two RAIG1 mRNA species in different cell and tissue types suggested that the competition between the upstream and downstream polyadenylation sites is well balanced regardless of the cell type and the level of transcription. Because both RAIG1 transcripts encode the same protein, it would be interesting to analyze the effects of 3′-end untranslated region on translation and stability of RAIG1 mRNA.The deduced RAIG1 amino acid sequence contains a characteristic secondary structure of seven transmembrane α-helical domains. The presence of this characteristic motif and the plasma membrane localization of the RAIG1-GFP chimeric protein support the conclusion that RAIG1 is a member of GPCRs superfamily. GPCRs represent an increasingly large and functionally diverse superfamily of receptors that mediate their intracellular actions by signaling pathways involving G proteins and downstream secondary messengers (27Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar, 35Baldwin J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 36Wess J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Receptors of this class respond to a variety of extracellular signals including light, lipid-derived messengers, neurotransmitters, and peptide hormones. Because the seven transmembrane domains are common to all members of GPCRs, most GPCRs bear sequence similarity with one another, primarily in the transmembrane regions (37Probst W.C. Snyder L.A. Schuster D.I. Brosius J. Sealfon S.C. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Among known members of GPCRs, RAIG1 protein shares a low sequence homology (25%) in the transmembrane domains only with mGluR2 and 3, which indicates that RAIG1 protein may be a novel GPCR rather than a member of the mGluR subfamily. Because GPCRs are targets for many types of therapeutics, studies on orphan receptors have become a seminal point for drug discovery using reverse molecular pharmacology strategy (38Stadel J.M. Wilson S. Bergsma D.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 430-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Therefore, it will be of interest to elucidate the function of RAIG1 protein and determine whether it too is a potential target for therapeutics.The lack of a sequence homology between RAIG1 protein and known GPCRs makes it difficult to predict the specific ligand for RAIG1 protein and the identity of its coupled G protein and secondary messengers. However, RAIG1's expression pattern provides some hints about its physiological functions. In normal tissues, RAIG1 mRNA was detected in various epithelial tissues but not in mesoderm-derived tissues. The expression of RAIG1 in epithelial tissues, notably the earodigestive tract, indicates its possible function in modulating differentiation and maintaining homeostasis of epithelial cells. The comparable messenger level of RAIG1 in fetal lung and kidney with adult tissues suggests a possible role in embryonic development and maturation of these organs. Retinoids are required for the proper embryonic development and epithelial cell differentiation (2Morriss-Kay G.M. Sokolova N. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 39Morriss-Kay G. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 40Lotan R. Cancer Res. 1994; 54 (suppl.): 1987-1990Google Scholar). Such actions are carried out by regulating the expression of downstream effectors, and RAIG1 could be one such target gene.RAIG1 mRNA level increased 3-fold within 2 h of ATRA (1 μm) treatment and almost reached a plateau by 4 h of treatment. The rapid response to ATRA suggests that RAIG1 is a primary target gene. Indeed, preliminary analysis of the upstream regulatory sequence of RAIG1 demonstrated that it confers transcriptional activation by ATRA in a promoter-luciferase construct (41Wang Y. Cheng Y. Lotan R. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1998; 39 (Abstr. 1881): 275Google Scholar). 9-cis-RA, a ligand for both RARs and retinoid X receptors, can up-regulate RAIG1 expression, whereas another natural retinoic acid, 13-cis-RA shows little effect. 13-cis-RA does not bind to retinoic acid receptors and is thought to act through its metabolites including ATRA (3Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York, NY1994Google Scholar). Therefore, treatment with 13-cis-RA may not result in sufficiently high levels of biological active retinoids to stimulate RAIG1 expression.Several previous reports linked effects of ATRA on cell differentiation to G-protein signaling pathways. ATRA induces F9 mouse teratocarcinoma cells to differentiate into primitive endoderm-like cells and decreases the steady-state level of the Gαi2 subunit (42Galvin-Parton P.A. Watkins D.C. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17771-17779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reduction of the Gαi2 protein by antisense RNA has ATRA-like effects on F9 cell differentiation. Overexpression of constitutively active mutant Gαi2 blocks the ATRA-induced F9 cell differentiation (43Watkins D.C. Johnson G.L. Malbon C.C. Science. 1992; 258: 1373-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These results indicate that suppression of Gαi2 expression is required for ATRA-induced F9 differentiation. In contrast, ATRA induces P19 mouse embryonic carcinoma cells to differentiate to endoderm by up-regulating expression of Gα12 and Gα13, which in turn activate c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (44Jho E.H. Davis R.J. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24468-24474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In ATRA-induced human TC teratocarcinoma cells differentiation, protein kinase A-associated Gαs and Gαi2 expression level increased (45Kurie J.M. Allopena J. Dmitrovsky E. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1222: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Exposure to ATRA induced HL-60 human leukemia cells to differentiate into granulocyte-like cells with increased expression of receptors for the chemoattractants interleukin-8, C5a (46Zahn S. Zwirner J. Spengler H.P. Gotze O. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 935-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and leukotriene B4 (47Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Those receptors are members of the GPCR superfamily and are required for normal leukocyte function in inflammatory response and host defense against infection. The ability of ATRA to modulate the expression of G proteins and GPCRs suggests that at least some aspects of ATRA-induced cell differentiation are mediated by G protein signaling pathways. Therefore, modulation of RAIG1 expression could contribute to the effects of retinoids on epithelial cell differentiation.RAIG1 expression in HNSCC and NSCLC cells varies from high abundance to undetectable levels. Because of the high level of RAIG1 mRNA in normal lung tissue, it is notable that RAIG1 was expressed at a low level in three of five HNSCC and four of six NSCLC cell lines tested. This finding raises the hypothesis that the decrease in RAIG1 expression is associated with the malignant transformation of some airway epithelial tissues. The observation that ATRA treatment can increase RAIG1 expression in cancer cells with low constitutive expression level indicates that retinoids can restore aberrant target gene expression in cancer cells and suggests that this may play a role in suppression of carcinogenesis. Further, RAIG1 induction may serve as a marker for ATRA-induced epithelial cell differentiation. Malignant transformation is often associated with abrogation of signaling pathways that are essential for maintaining normal development, differentiation, and homeostasis. One of the approaches to cancer prevention and therapy is to restore aberrant pathways to normalcy. In this regard, retinoids have been shown to affect many fundamental cellular processes including embryogenesis, differentiation, and tumorigenesis (1Love J.M. Gudas L.J. Curr. Opin.

Ligand-dependent activation of nuclear receptors may involve dissociation of co-repressor and recruitment of co-activator by the receptor (14Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B.

Only a few of these genes can potentially mediate retinoid signaling for modulation of cell growth (1Love J.M. Gudas L.J. Curr. Opin.

Raven Press, New York, NY1994Google Scholar). The mechanisms through which retinoids suppress carcinogenesis are not well understood. However, it is thought that nuclear receptors play an important role in this mechanism (1Love J.M. Gudas L.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 4Lotan R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 17Lotan R. Environ.

In vitrostudies have shown that retinoids inhibit cell proliferation and suppress squamous cell differentiation in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines (18Zou C-P. Clifford J.L. Xu X-C. Sacks P.G. Chambon P. Hong W.K. Lotan R. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5479-5487PubMed Google Scholar). Human oral squamous carcinoma cell UMSCC-22B is sensitive to ATRA in a clonogenic assay (19Jetten A.M. Kim J.S. Sacks P.G. Rearick J.I. Lotan D. Hong W.K. Lotan R. Int. J. Cancer. 1990; 45: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and exhibits diminished growth as xeno-transplants in nude mice treated with RAR-selective retinoid ALRT1150 (20Shalinsky D.R.

To better understand molecular events in retinoid-induced cell growth inhibition and differentiation, we use the differential display technique (21Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4688) Google Scholar) to identify retinoic acid-regulated genes in UMSCC-22B cells. Here, we present the cDNA of a novel retinoic acid-responsive gene, retinoic acid-induced gene 1 (RAIG1), which encodes a putative guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptor. Our results suggest that retinoids may exert biological function through interaction with a yet to be defined G-protein signaling pathway. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we cloned and characterized the cDNA of a novel retinoic acid-responsive gene, RAIG1, from UMSCC-22B cells. A unique feature of RAIG1 is the presence of two mRNA species, which presumably results from alternative utilization of different polyadenylation signals. There are four potential poly(A) signals in the primary transcript unit of RAIG1, of which only the first and the last are used in 3′ end RNA polyadenylation/cleavage reaction. In many occasions, RNA processing involves a selection among multiple polyadenylation sites (33Wahle E. Kuhn U. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 57: 41-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Polyadenylation signals can be strong or weak relative to one another, depending on their surrounding sequence context (34Edwalds-Gilbert G. Veraldi K.L. Milcarek C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2547-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The relative stable ratios between the two RAIG1 mRNA species in different cell and tissue types suggested that the competition between the upstream and downstream polyadenylation sites is well balanced regardless of the cell type and the level of transcription. Because both RAIG1 transcripts encode the same protein, it would be interesting to analyze the effects of 3′-end untranslated region on translation and stability of RAIG1 mRNA.The deduced RAIG1 amino acid sequence contains a characteristic secondary structure of seven transmembrane α-helical domains. The presence of this characteristic motif and the plasma membrane localization of the RAIG1-GFP chimeric protein support the conclusion that RAIG1 is a member of GPCRs superfamily. GPCRs represent an increasingly large and functionally diverse superfamily of receptors that mediate their intracellular actions by signaling pathways involving G proteins and downstream secondary messengers (27Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar, 35Baldwin J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 36Wess J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Receptors of this class respond to a variety of extracellular signals including light, lipid-derived messengers, neurotransmitters, and peptide hormones. Because the seven transmembrane domains are common to all members of GPCRs, most GPCRs bear sequence similarity with one another, primarily in the transmembrane regions (37Probst W.C. Snyder L.A. Schuster D.I. Brosius J. Sealfon S.C. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Among known members of GPCRs, RAIG1 protein shares a low sequence homology (25%) in the transmembrane domains only with mGluR2 and 3, which indicates that RAIG1 protein may be a novel GPCR rather than a member of the mGluR subfamily. Because GPCRs are targets for many types of therapeutics, studies on orphan receptors have become a seminal point for drug discovery using reverse molecular pharmacology strategy (38Stadel J.M. Wilson S. Bergsma D.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 430-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Therefore, it will be of interest to elucidate the function of RAIG1 protein and determine whether it too is a potential target for therapeutics.The lack of a sequence homology between RAIG1 protein and known GPCRs makes it difficult to predict the specific ligand for RAIG1 protein and the identity of its coupled G protein and secondary messengers. However, RAIG1's expression pattern provides some hints about its physiological functions. In normal tissues, RAIG1 mRNA was detected in various epithelial tissues but not in mesoderm-derived tissues. The expression of RAIG1 in epithelial tissues, notably the earodigestive tract, indicates its possible function in modulating differentiation and maintaining homeostasis of epithelial cells. The comparable messenger level of RAIG1 in fetal lung and kidney with adult tissues suggests a possible role in embryonic development and maturation of these organs. Retinoids are required for the proper embryonic development and epithelial cell differentiation (2Morriss-Kay G.M. Sokolova N. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 39Morriss-Kay G. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 40Lotan R. Cancer Res. 1994; 54 (suppl.): 1987-1990Google Scholar). Such actions are carried out by regulating the expression of downstream effectors, and RAIG1 could be one such target gene.RAIG1 mRNA level increased 3-fold within 2 h of ATRA (1 μm) treatment and almost reached a plateau by 4 h of treatment. The rapid response to ATRA suggests that RAIG1 is a primary target gene. Indeed, preliminary analysis of the upstream regulatory sequence of RAIG1 demonstrated that it confers transcriptional activation by ATRA in a promoter-luciferase construct (41Wang Y. Cheng Y. Lotan R. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1998; 39 (Abstr. 1881): 275Google Scholar). 9-cis-RA, a ligand for both RARs and retinoid X receptors, can up-regulate RAIG1 expression, whereas another natural retinoic acid, 13-cis-RA shows little effect. 13-cis-RA does not bind to retinoic acid receptors and is thought to act through its metabolites including ATRA (3Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York, NY1994Google Scholar). Therefore, treatment with 13-cis-RA may not result in sufficiently high levels of biological active retinoids to stimulate RAIG1 expression.Several previous reports linked effects of ATRA on cell differentiation to G-protein signaling pathways. ATRA induces F9 mouse teratocarcinoma cells to differentiate into primitive endoderm-like cells and decreases the steady-state level of the Gαi2 subunit (42Galvin-Parton P.A. Watkins D.C. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17771-17779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reduction of the Gαi2 protein by antisense RNA has ATRA-like effects on F9 cell differentiation. Overexpression of constitutively active mutant Gαi2 blocks the ATRA-induced F9 cell differentiation (43Watkins D.C. Johnson G.L. Malbon C.C. Science. 1992; 258: 1373-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These results indicate that suppression of Gαi2 expression is required for ATRA-induced F9 differentiation. In contrast, ATRA induces P19 mouse embryonic carcinoma cells to differentiate to endoderm by up-regulating expression of Gα12 and Gα13, which in turn activate c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (44Jho E.H. Davis R.J. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24468-24474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In ATRA-induced human TC teratocarcinoma cells differentiation, protein kinase A-associated Gαs and Gαi2 expression level increased (45Kurie J.M. Allopena J. Dmitrovsky E. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1222: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Exposure to ATRA induced HL-60 human leukemia cells to differentiate into granulocyte-like cells with increased expression of receptors for the chemoattractants interleukin-8, C5a (46Zahn S. Zwirner J. Spengler H.P. Gotze O. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 935-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and leukotriene B4 (47Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Those receptors are members of the GPCR superfamily and are required for normal leukocyte function in inflammatory response and host defense against infection. The ability of ATRA to modulate the expression of G proteins and GPCRs suggests that at least some aspects of ATRA-induced cell differentiation are mediated by G protein signaling pathways. Therefore, modulation of RAIG1 expression could contribute to the effects of retinoids on epithelial cell differentiation.RAIG1 expression in HNSCC and NSCLC cells varies from high abundance to undetectable levels. Because of the high level of RAIG1 mRNA in normal lung tissue, it is notable that RAIG1 was expressed at a low level in three of five HNSCC and four of six NSCLC cell lines tested. This finding raises the hypothesis that the decrease in RAIG1 expression is associated with the malignant transformation of some airway epithelial tissues. The observation that ATRA treatment can increase RAIG1 expression in cancer cells with low constitutive expression level indicates that retinoids can restore aberrant target gene expression in cancer cells and suggests that this may play a role in suppression of carcinogenesis. Further, RAIG1 induction may serve as a marker for ATRA-induced epithelial cell differentiation. In this study, we cloned and characterized the cDNA of a novel retinoic acid-responsive gene, RAIG1, from UMSCC-22B cells.

The homozygous knock-out mice show markedly reduced ACAT activity and reduced amounts of cholesteryl esters in adrenal glands and in macrophages but not in the liver, suggesting the presence of at least one additional ACAT gene. Two different ACAT genes are present in yeast (15Yang H. Bard M. Bruner D.A. Gleeson A. Deckelbaum R.J. Alijinovic G. Pohl T.M. Rothstein R. Sturley S.L.

This and other evidence led to the recent cloning of a second ACAT gene, designated as ACAT-2 (17Cases S. Zheng Y.W. Novak S. Meiner V. Myers H. Erickson S.K. Farese Jr., R.V.

The predicted ACAT-2 protein sequence shares significant homology with that of the ACAT-1 protein, particularly near the C-terminal halves of the polypeptides. Specific polyclonal anti-ACAT-1 IgGs have been produced (19Chang C.C.Y. Chen J. Thomas M.A. Cheng D. Del Priore V.A. Newton R.S. Pape M.E. Chang T.Y. J. Biol.

Immunoblot and immunodepletion analyses show that the ACAT-1 protein is present in homogenates from various human cells and tissues as a single 50-kDa protein band in SDS-PAGE (19Chang C.C.Y. Chen J. Thomas M.A. Cheng D. Del Priore V.A. Newton R.S. Pape M.E. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29532-29540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) Furthermore, immunodepletion experiments using anti-ACAT-1 IgGs suggest that the ACAT-1 protein plays a major role in ACAT catalysis in human fibroblasts, HepG2 cells, human hepatocytes, macrophages, adrenal glands, and kidneys (22Lee O. Chang C.C.Y. Lee W. Chang T.Y. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1722-1727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, in human intestines, approximately 80% of total measurable ACAT activity is resistant to immunodepletion, suggesting that ACAT activity in this particular tissue may be largely due to the presence of a different ACAT protein (22Lee O. Chang C.C.Y. Lee W. Chang T.Y. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1722-1727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Judging from results currently available, it is possible that the physiological functions ofACAT-1 and ACAT-2 are different in different species. Whether ACAT-2 is responsible for most of the observed ACAT activity in human intestines is not clear at present. The ACAT protein has never before been purified to homogeneity. The difficulty in doing so was largely due to its minute quantity and the lack of a suitable detergent for solubilizing the protein from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane with retention of enzyme activity (reviewed in Ref. 5Chang T.Y. Doolittle G.M. Enzymes. 1983; 16: 523-539Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As described in this article, we have isolated a CHO cell line (HisACAT-1 cells) that stably expresses the human ACAT-1 (hACAT-1) protein bearing a hexahistidine tag at its N terminus. We report the use of this cell line as the starting material to develop a purification scheme that enables us to purify the enzyme to essential homogeneity. We also present some kinetic properties of the purified enzyme in mixed micelles made of bile salt, cholesterol, and phosphatidylcholine (PC), or in cholesterol/PC vesicles. Collectively, our results support the hypothesis that the sigmoidal dependence of ACAT activity upon cholesterol concentration (1Chang T.Y. Chang C.C.Y. Cheng D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 613-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 5Chang T.Y. Doolittle G.M. Enzymes. 1983; 16: 523-539Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) is an intrinsic property of the enzyme. A fragment was generated containing an ATG translation initiation codon, a 6-histidine tag that functions as a metal-binding domain, a T7 tag that serves as a transcript stabilizing sequence from gene 10 of phage T7, and an enterokinase cleavage recognition sequence (a total of 40 amino acids). This construct (originally designed by Invitrogen for baculovirus transfer vector pBlueBacHis) was ligated to the N terminus of hACAT-1 cDNA (nucleotide residues 1397–3046, a total of 550 amino acids, with the first methionine (ATG) converted to leucine (CTA) by site-specific mutagenesis). This entire fragment was then ligated into the expression vector pcDNA3 (from Invitrogen). Using a modified calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitation method (23Hasan M.T. Subbaroyan R. Chang T.Y. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1991; 17: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the plasmid was transfected into an ACAT-deficient cell line, AC29, that lacks endogenous ACAT message and protein (19Chang C.C.Y. Chen J. Thomas M.A. Cheng D. Del Priore V.A. Newton R.S. Pape M.E. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29532-29540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). One day after transfection, cells were selected for G-418 resistance by including 500 μg/ml G-418 in growth medium for 1 week. The G-418 resistant colonies were examined for their cytoplasmic cholesteryl ester lipid droplet content by microscopic examination according to procedures described earlier (13Chang C.C.Y. Huh H.Y. Cadigan K.M. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20747-20755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The clones that scored positive for cytoplasmic lipid droplets were approximately 5% of the total G-418 resistant clones; they were isolated with cloning rings and recloned by dilution. In this manner, a stable clone expressing high ACAT activity in vitro and in hACAT protein content was isolated and named HisACAT-1. To maintain clonal purity, cloned HisACAT-1 cells were stored at 5 × 106 cells/ml in 90% fetal bovine serum and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide in a −80 °C freezer. Upon thawing, each clone was kept in continuous culture for about 2 weeks, then discarded. The HisACAT-1 cells were grown as monolayers according to the procedure for growing CHO cells described earlier (19Chang C.C.Y. Chen J. Thomas M.A. Cheng D. Del Priore V.A. Newton R.S. Pape M.E. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29532-29540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested at 80–90% confluency (approximately 0.2 × 106 cells/cm2surface area). Cells were harvested by hypotonic shock and scraping (24Chang T.Y. Limanek J.S. Chang C.C.Y. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 116: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); the protein concentration of the cell homogenates was kept at 2–4 mg/ml in Buffer A (50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA at pH 7.8 with protease inhibitors included at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 20 μg/ml chymostatin, and 40 μg/ml pefabloc). In order to prepare the subcellular components from tissue culture cells, whole cell extract was homogenized with a stainless steel tissue grinder (from Wheaton: Dura-Grind). To solubilize the enzyme, KCl and CHAPS were added to the cell homogenates to obtain a final concentration of 1 m KCl and 2.5% CHAPS. To assay the enzyme in reconstituted vesicles, the procedure described earlier (19Chang C.C.Y. Chen J. Thomas M.A. Cheng D. Del Priore V.A. Newton R.S. Pape M.E. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29532-29540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) was used with the following slight modification: unless otherwise stated, the molar ratio of cholesterol and PC in the vesicle was kept at 0.2 instead of 0.3 used previously (19Chang C.C.Y.

To assay the enzyme in bile salt/cholesterol/PC mixed micelles, purified enzyme (20 μl) was diluted into 100 μl of bile salt/cholesterol/PC mixed micelles. The bile salt/cholesterol/PC mixed micelles were prepared as follows: the cholesterol/PC mixture was prepared as described previously (25Ventimiglia J.B. Levesque M.C. Chang T.Y. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 26Shi S.P. Chang C.C.Y. Gould G.W. Chang T.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 982: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and lyophilized to remove residual organic solvents. After lyophilization, sodium taurocholate (or other detergents as indicated) in Buffer A was added to reach a final concentration of 10 mg/ml (or other concentrations as indicated). The mixture was purged with nitrogen, followed by sonication until this mixture was clear. ACAT assay was initiated by adding 20 μl of solution containing 10 nmol of [3H]oleoyl-CoA and 10 nmol of fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, to the enzyme-vesicle mixture or the enzyme-mixed micelle mixture prepared on ice. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for up to 30 min, during which the activity was found to be linear. The recombinant fusion protein GST-ACAT-1 (amino acid residues 1–131) (19Chang C.C.Y. Chen J. Thomas M.A. Cheng D. Del Priore V.A. Newton R.S. Pape M.E. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29532-29540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) was used to immunize three male BALB/c mice. Each mouse was injected subcutaneously with 20 μg of GST-ACAT-1 emulsified in the presence of complete Freund's adjuvant and phosphate-buffered saline (50/50, v/v). Two and four weeks later, the mice were injected with the same amount of antigen emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. The mouse with the highest antibody titers, determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using detergent-free GST-ACAT-1 coated on microwells, was selected for cell fusion. Three days later, the designated mouse was boosted with 40 μg of detergent-free GST-ACAT-1 in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline through the tail vein. The NS-1 cells were fused with spleen cells of the immunized mouse in the presence of 50% polyethylene glycol (M r = 1, 500). Following cell fusion, the hybrid cells were cultured in a semi-solid Isocove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 1.25% methylcellulose, 25% fetal calf serum, HAT (hypoxanthine, aminopterine, thymidine), 50 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide, and 5 × 105/ml thymocytes (27Davis J.M. Pennington J.E. Kubler A.M. Consceince J.F. J. Immunol. Methods. 1982; 50: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Seven days after cell fusion, a total of about 900 hybrid clones were removed and cultured in an RPMI complete medium containing HT and penicillin-streptomycin. Two to three days later, the cultured supernatants were removed for screening of antibody secretion with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using GST-ACAT-1 or GST protein alone coated microwells. Only two hybrid cell lines, designated as ACAT-1a and ACAT-1c, were found to secrete antibodies to ACAT-1 protein. Additional results showed that ACAT-1a IgG and ACAT-1c IgG recognized the same epitope within hACAT-1 amino acid residues 1–40. Antibody-containing ascites fluid of each cell line was generated by intraperitoneally injecting pristane-primed BALB/c mice with about 1–3 × 105/ml hybridoma cells. The antibody was purified by protein A-Sepharose column. Monoclonal ACAT-1a IgG was coupled with Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) according to instructions given in the manufacturer's manual. All protein determinations were made using Peterson's modifications (28Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7142) Google Scholar) of the Lowry method. Trichloroacetic acid precipitation was performed when samples contained interfering substances. Salt and detergent were removed from samples by chloroform/methanol extraction (29Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar). All samples were then resuspended in loading buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 9% SDS, 50 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min before loading onto SDS-PAGE. DM10, the affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit IgGs against GST-ACAT-1 (amino acid residues 1–131), was used as the primary antibody for immunoblotting (19Chang C.C.Y. Chen J. Thomas M.A. Cheng D.

For silver stain gels, Bio-Rad's Silver Plus Kit was used according to instructions. CHAPS, taurocholate, oleoyl-coenzyme A, egg PC, cholesteryl oleate, cholesterol, fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin were all obtained from Sigma. The software program PRISM was purchased from Sigma. All reagent-grade solvents were obtained from Fisher. Triton X-100 was from CalBiochem. Charcoal-purified cholic acid and deoxycholate were generous gifts from Dr. Bernard Trumpower (Dartmouth Medical School). [1,2-(N)3H]Cholesterol was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, 50 Ci/mmol. [3H]Oleoyl-coenzyme A was synthesized as described (30Bishop J.E. Hajra A.K. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibodies against hACAT-1 are available through Vancouver Biotech Ltd. Through various insertional and deletion mutagenesis experiments with cloned human ACAT-1cDNA, we found that the region comprising the first 63 amino acids of hACAT-1 protein is not essential for enzyme catalysis (results not shown). We therefore placed a 40-amino acid sequence tag as the N-terminal extension of the hACAT-1 cDNA. This tag contains a methionine codon followed by hexahistidine and T7-antigenic sequences. The fragment was ligated with an expression vector pcDNA3 and then transfected with ACAT-deficient CHO cell mutant AC29, which lacks endogenous ACAT message and protein (19Chang C.C.Y. Chen J. Thomas M.A. Cheng D. Del Priore V.A. Newton R.S. Pape M.E. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29532-29540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). A stable transfectant clone designated as HisACAT-1, expressing ample human ACAT activity in intact cells and in vitro, was isolated (see “Experimental Procedures”). According to SDS-PAGE analyses, the HisACAT-1 protein expressed in this cell line is a single 54-kDa protein without detectable intracellular degradation (results not shown). This cell line was chosen as the starting material to develop a scheme for purifying the enzyme to homogeneity. We prepared cell homogenates from HisACAT-1 cells and isolated the membrane fraction by sequential centrifugation. The subcellular fractionation procedure provided an average of 3-fold purification as measured by comparing ACAT specific activity between whole cell extract and microsome. The activity recovery averaged approximately 50% (Fig.1, panel A). Immunoblotting analysis showed a similar degree of enrichment in the HisACAT-1 protein; a typical result is shown in Fig. 1, panel B. We next searched for an appropriate detergent to solubilize the HisACAT-1 protein, yet leave the solubilized enzyme amenable to various purification procedures. We found that the zwitterionic detergent CHAPS at 2–2.5% could effectively solubilize the HisACAT-1 protein with retention of enzyme activity; a typical result is shown in Fig.2. We also found that the inclusion of 1m KCl during the solubilization procedure helped increase the ACAT activity recovery in the 100,000 × gsupernatant fraction. Immunoblotting analysis showed that CHAPS along with 1 m KCl could solubilize at least 70% of total detectable hACAT-1 protein present in either whole cell extracts or in the microsome fraction (results not shown). The hACAT-1 protein solubilized by this procedure is not entirely stable. At 4 °C, the solubilized enzyme loses 30–50% of its original activity within 4–10 h. The loss of enzyme activity can be partially prevented by including certain protease inhibitors in the buffer solutions (results not shown). For this reason, we have routinely added various protease inhibitors (see “Experimental Procedures”) up to the solubilization step of the purification scheme (Fig. 1).Figure 2Solubilization of HisACAT-1 enzyme by detergents. HisACAT-1 cells (or AC29 cells, as control) were seeded at a density of 2 × 106 cells per 25-cm2 flask for 48 h in Ham's F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Fresh medium was replaced 2 h before harvesting. Cells were subjected to hypotonic shock for 3 min, then thoroughly homogenized in Buffer A at a protein concentration of ∼3 mg/ml (see “Experimental Procedures”). Cell extract (15 μl) was solubilized by either deoxycholate (DOC) or CHAPS (with or without 1 m KCl) at the indicated detergent concentrations, with a final volume of 40 μl. Cholesterol/PC vesicles were added to dilute the detergent and reach a final detergent/PC molar ratio of 0.4. ACAT assay was carried out at 37 °C for 5 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next attempted to purify the solubilized enzyme using ACAT monoclonal antibody affinity column chromatography. The column was pre-equilibrated at 4 °C with 50 mmKH2PO4 at pH 7.4 containing 1 m KCl and 0.5% CHAPS (Buffer B). Upon loading the solubilized enzyme solution through the column four times by gravity flow, we found that around 10–15% of the enzyme did not bind to the column. After extensively washing the column with 12 column volumes of 10 mm KH2PO4 at pH 7.0 containing 1m KCl and 0.5% CHAPS, the bound enzyme was then detached from the column by eluting with 50 mm citrate buffer at pH 3.5 containing 1 m KCl and 0.5% CHAPS. A typical result is shown in Fig. 3. The pH of the eluted protein fractions was immediately neutralized by including 2m KH2PO4 at pH 9.0 in the collection vessels. The eluted enzyme was found to remain enzymologically active. In three separate experiments, the recovery of ACAT activity in the pH 3.5 eluant averaged 10–30% of the applied activity. Due to the low protein concentration in the pH 3.5 eluant, we could only roughly estimate that the fold purification provided by the monoclonal antibody column was around 100. Still, this method did not provide us with a homogeneous enzyme. This is demonstrated inPanel C (silver stain) of Fig. 3, which shows the ACAT protein band (located at 54 kDa) sandwiched between two major impurity bands in SDS-PAGE. As evaluated by silver staining after SDS-PAGE, the purity of the enzyme at this stage varied from 5 to 10%. We next used nickel column chromatography for the final purification step. After the ACAT monoclonal antibody column purification step, the purified HisACAT-1 protein firmly bound to the nickel beads. With extensive buffer washes, HisACAT-1 was able to be eluted off the column with buffer containing 250–500 mm imidazole in Buffer B. In several experiments, we found that nickel column chromatography consistently provided a very good recovery of both ACAT activity and protein (averaging around 60% of total ACAT activity and HisACAT-1 protein loaded onto the column). It also serves the purpose of concentrating the enzyme solution. A typical result is shown in Fig.4. Nickel column chromatography used alone with the solubilized enzyme could not provide us with a homogeneous pure HisACAT-1 protein. However, when it was added after the monoclonal antibody column step, the resultant enzyme eluted off the column at high imidazole concentration (500 mm) exhibited essentially a single protein band at 54 kDa as analyzed by SDS-PAGE with silver staining (Fig. 4, panel C, lanes 13–15). A parallel set of samples were analyzed by immuoblot using the specific anti-ACAT-1 antibodies; the results indicate a single immunoreactive band at the same molecular weight (54 kDa) (Fig. 4, panel B, lanes 13–15). Furthermore, the variation in intensity of the immunoreactive band correlated well with the variation in intensity of the silver staining band, indicating that the single 54-kDa protein band demonstrated inpanel B is ACAT-1.Figure 4Nickel column chromatography after the hACAT-1 monoclonal antibody affinity column. 9.5 ml of active fractions (from lanes 7–16 shown in Fig. 3, Panel B) was loaded onto a 3-ml nickel column (Novagen's HisBond Resin). 36 ml of buffer (see text) was used to wash off unbound proteins. The column was then eluted with increasing concentrations of imidazole in the buffer as indicated. Panel A, ACAT assay by cholesterol/PC vesicle method; Panel B, immunoblot;Panel C, silver stain. The numbers inparentheses shown in Panel A correspond to the fraction numbers in Panels B and C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As shown in lanes 13–15 of panel C, Fig. 4, in addition to the 54-kDa HisACAT-1 protein band, there are zonal material(s) present at a higher molecular weight range (90–120 kDa) that can be stained positively with silver. We do not know the nature of this material, but we have noted that similar material can sometimes be detected even in empty lanes that contain no protein samples. Also, this material was not always found in the final ACAT preparations. We repeated the purification procedure four times, then assessed the purities of the final preparations by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. In each of these four preparations, we found that only a single protein band at 54 kDa was detectable (lanes 10–13in Fig. 5; designated as HisACAT-1). Based on this criterion, we judge that the ACAT-1 protein after the nickel column chromatography has been purified to essential homogeneity. It has been difficult to estimate the quantity of HisACAT-1 protein present in the last two steps, mainly due to its low concentration. To semi-quantitate the protein at low levels, we first extracted ACAT-1 samples and various protein standards prepared in parallel with chloroform/methanol (29Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar) (to remove the detergents and salts and to concentrate the protein samples), then used silver staining after SDS-PAGE to compare the intensity of HisACAT-1 protein with intensities of protein standards.

Rhodobacter sphaeroides is a facultative photoheterotrophic proteobacterium of the α3 subdivision and is known for its remarkable metabolic versatility. Under aerobic conditions,R. sphaeroides derives energy by aerobic respiration. When oxygen tensions decrease below certain threshold levels, dramatic changes in the cellular physiology occur. An intracytoplasmic membrane system develops that houses various components of the photosystem whose function is to capture photons and to convert light energy into electron flow (1Cohen-Bazire G. Sistrom W.R. Stanier R.Y. J. Cell. Comp. Physiol. 1957; 49: 25-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar, 2Kiley P.J. Kaplan S. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 50-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transition from aerobic to an anaerobic light environment requires, among other things, a significant increase in expression of the photosystem genes, i.e. genes encoding structural and assembly proteins of the light harvesting and reaction center complexes as well as genes encoding enzymes for bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoid biosynthesis. Under highly aerobic conditions, these genes are expressed at low basal levels. Several transcription factors coordinate the regulation of photosystem gene expression (reviewed in Refs. 3Pemberton J.M. Horne I.M. McEwan A.G. Microbiology (Reading). 1998; 144: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar and 4Zeilstra-Ryalls J. Gomelsky M. Eraso J.M. Yeliseev A. O'Gara J. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2801-2809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some of these factors are specific to photosystem gene expression, e.g. a redox-sensitive transcriptional repressor PpsR (5Gomelsky M.

Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 32-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Eraso J.M. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2695-2706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the anaerobic activator, FnrL (10Zeilstra-Ryalls J.H. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6422-6431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The AppA protein has been identified as yet another critical component required for activation of photosystem gene expression (11Gomelsky M. Kaplan S. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1805-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 12Gomelsky M. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4609-4618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AnR. sphaeroides 2.4.1 AppA null mutant is impaired in its transition from aerobic to anaerobic photosynthetic growth because of defects in the production of both photopigments and structural protein components of the photosystem. In contrast to the transcriptional factors mentioned above, the primary sequence of AppA gives no clue as to its possible role in photosystem gene expression. AppA contains no DNA binding motif(s) and shows no obvious similarity to proteins with known function. Using a variety of molecular genetic approaches, we have established that AppA exerts its regulatory effect independently of the FnrL and PrrBA regulatory pathways, but it does appear to affect PpsR repressor activity (7Gomelsky M. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 128-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At present, neither the nature of the redox sensitivity of PpsR (13Ponnampalam S.N. Bauer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18391-18396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 14Gomelsky M. Lee H.-J. Kaplan S. Peschek G.A. Loffelhardt W. Schmetterer G. The Phototrophic Prokaryotes. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1998Google Scholar) nor the mechanism of the AppA-PpsR interactions is known. AppA could function as a hypothetical redox-sensing partner directly interacting with PpsR. Alternatively, it could be involved in modulation of a critical redox carrier, which in turn interacts with or is a cofactor of the PpsR repressor. Until now, we have remained unaware of what features, if any, allow AppA to participate in redox-dependent processes. In this work, we present the first biochemical characterization of AppA, which has revealed that this protein is likely to contain several redox-responsive cofactors. We have identified one of these compounds as FAD. We have located the FAD binding domain within AppA and tested the significance of this domain for protein function. We have also uncovered, as a result of this study, a small group of bacterial flavoproteins showing similarity to the FAD binding domain of AppA. Escherichia coli strains were grown at 37 °C (unless specified otherwise) in LB medium (15Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) supplemented, when required, with the following antibiotics: ampicillin, 100 μg/ml; tetracycline, 10 μg/ml. R. sphaeroides strains were grown at 30 °C in Sistrom's medium A (1Cohen-Bazire G. Sistrom W.R. Stanier R.Y. J. Cell. Comp. Physiol. 1957; 49: 25-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar), supplemented, when required, with tetracycline, 1 μg/ml. An aerobic-to-anaerobic transition was performed as follows. Liquid cultures (5 ml) of the AppA null strain, APP11 (12Gomelsky M. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4609-4618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), carrying the appropriate plasmid(s) in trans, were grown aerobically in culture tubes until late exponential phase and placed at 4 °C overnight. These cultures were then diluted 1:50 with fresh medium to approximately the same optical density at 660 nm, placed into fully filled screw-cap tubes, and grown anaerobically under incandescent illumination at a light intensity of approximately 10 W/m2. Plasmids were introduced into E. coli strains by either electroporation (Gene Pulser, Bio-Rad) or CaCl2transformation (15Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) and into R. sphaeroides by conjugation as described (16Davis J. Donohue T.J. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 320-329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Standard recombinant DNA techniques (15Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) and molecular biological enzymes and reagents were used according to specifications provided by the manufacturers. DNA sequencing with either the universal or sequence-specific primers was performed on an ABI377 automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems) at the DNA Core Facility of the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics. All recombinant DNA constructs described here were verified by DNA sequencing. Sequence analyses were performed using BLAST+BEAUTY, WU-BLAST+BEAUTY, ClustalW 1.7 (multiple alignment) programs, available at the Baylor College of Medicine Search Launcher. 1http://gc.bcm.tmc.edu:8088/search-launcher/launcher.html. Analysis of protein secondary structures was performed using the consensus secondary structure prediction developed by James Cuff and available as a part of the Jpred package. 2http://circinus.ebi.ac.uk:8081// The 1.6-kilobase pair XhoI-AgeI fragment from plasmid p484Nco1 (12Gomelsky M. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4609-4618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), carrying the appA gene, was first cloned into the multiple cloning site of vector LITMUS28 (NEB Biolabs), digested with XhoI and AgeI, to produce plasmid pLapp. TheXhoI [513] site is positioned 4 codons downstream of the translational start of AppA; the AgeI site is positioned 270 base pairs downstream of the appA stop codon. The number in brackets corresponds to the sequence coordinates deposited in GenBankL42555. To construct a translational fusion of AppA to the amino terminus of LacZα (LacZ′::AppA) expressed from LITMUS28, pLapp was digested with SpeI and NsiI, treated with T4 polymerase and religated. The resulting plasmid, pLappA, expresses 19 residues of LacZα fused in-frame with the AppA protein under control of Plac (see Fig. 1). The deletion derivatives of pLappA, expressing the amino-terminal portions of AppA, were constructed by removing the 3′-terminal portions ofappA using the Ecl136II site of the vector positioned downstream of appA and the following internal sites: plasmid pLapNae-NaeI [868]; pLapNar-NarI [748] (see Fig. 1). To construct the glutathione-S-transferase (GST) 3The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathione-S-transferase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; Plac, lac promoter; Ptac, tac promoter; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. fusion with AppA (GST-AppA), the 1.6-kilobase pair BglII-Ecl136II fragment from pLapp containing the appA gene was first cloned into vector pGEX-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) digested withBamHI and SmaI to produce plasmid pGapp5. The translational frame was reconstructed by digesting pGapp5 withNsiI, making ends blunt with T4 polymerase and religation. The resulting plasmid, pGappN, expressed GST fused to the fifth codon of AppA under control of Ptac (see Fig. 1). The carboxyl-terminal deletion derivatives based on pGappN were constructed by removing the 3′-terminal portions of appA using theEcoRI site of the vector (positioned downstream ofappA) and the following internal sites: plasmid pGapR-EcoRI [1776]; pGapRs-RsrII [1558]; pGapS-SalI [1406]; pGapB-BamHI [1285]; pGapStu-StuI [1188]; pGapSty-StyI [1066]; pGapNa-NaeI [868]; pGapSm-SmaI [640]. Plasmid pGapΔSm, expressing an AppA amino-terminal deletion derivative, was constructed based on pGapp5 digested with NsiI andXmaI [640], treated with T4 polymerase, and religated (see Fig. 1). All plasmids used for expression in R. sphaeroides were based on vector pRK415 (17Keen N.T. Tamaki S. Kobayashi D. Trollinger D. Gene. 1988; 70: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). Plasmid p484-Nco5 contains the full-lengthappA gene with its own promoter (12Gomelsky M. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4609-4618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To construct theappA gene derivative lacking the flavin binding domain, plasmid p484Nco5 (12Gomelsky M. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4609-4618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was digested with XhoI (partial digest) and StyI; the derivative containing the desired deletion of the XhoI [513]-StyI [1066] fragment located within the appA gene was gel-purified, blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase, and religated, resulting in plasmid p484Nco5Δ. The 2.1-kilobase pair HindIII-SacI fragment from p484Nco5Δ was cloned into vector pRK415 digested withHindIII and SacI, resulting in plasmid p484-Nco5Δ. The latter plasmid differs from p484-Nco5 only by deletion of the XhoI [513]-StyI [1066] fragment, resulting in an in-frame deletion of amino acid residues 5–190 of the AppA protein. The gene encoding the E. coli F403 protein was PCR-amplified using synthetic primers: F403-S, 5′-ttgttaggcCTTACCACCCTTATTTATCGTAGCC-3′, and F403-R, 5′-ACTGAAtTCATGTGAAAGAATGTGCTG-3′, whose design was based upon the sequence deposited in GenBank under the accession number AE000215. The nucleotides shown in lower case represent deviations from the GenBank file sequence. These were introduced to create theStuI restriction site (F403-S) positioned at the translational start codon and EcoRI downstream off403 (F403-R). Chromosomal DNA isolated (15Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) from E. coli DH5α was used as a PCR template. PCR was performed withPfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) as follows: 97 °C, 5 min; 30 × (95 °C, 45 s; 55 °C, 45 s; 68 °C, 3 min); 72 °C, 6 min. The 1.3-kilobase pair PCR fragment corresponding tof403 was gel-purified, digested with StuI, and cloned into the SmaI site of vector pGEX-2TK to produce plasmid pGORF403. The latter plasmid expresses the GST-F403 translational fusion under control of Ptac. The plasmids overexpressing various portions of AppA were routinely maintained in E. coli DH5α. Standard protocols for induction of expression were used according to recommendations of the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). Because full-length AppA, expressed from either pGappN (as a GST-AppA fusion) or pLappA, was always found in the insoluble fraction, various modifications of the standard protocol were attempted to achieve production of AppA in soluble form. These modifications included lower growth temperatures (12 to 37 °C), lower IPTG concentration (0.05 to 1.0 mm), variable times of induction (1 to 20 h (for low temperature-growing cultures)), alternative E. coli hosts in place of DH5α, e.g. JM109, HB101, solubilization of cell extracts with 0.1% Triton X-100 or sodium lauryl sarcosyl, addition of 1–5 mm dithiothreitol, etc. These modifications did not result in an increased production of soluble AppA. The AppA containing inclusion bodies from 1 liter of DH5α(pLappA) culture were partially purified by multiple rounds of washing (PBS buffer containing 0.05% Triton X-100) followed by low speed centrifugation (45 min, 3,500 × g) of the insoluble portion of crude cell extract. Strains DH5α(pGapNae) and DH5α(pGORF403), overexpressing the GST fusions to the 120-residue amino-terminal fragment of AppA and F403, respectively, produced significant amounts of soluble proteins when grown at room temperature and induced by 0.4 mm IPTG (final concentration) for 8 h. These proteins were purified by affinity chromatography according to recommendations of the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). AppA-enriched inclusion bodies were originally extracted with acetone/concentrated HCl (1000: 1.3 v/v) and pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was subjected to spectral analysis. Flavins were extracted from the yellow-pigmented protein preparations by heating at 95 °C for 15 min in PBS buffer. The released flavins were separated from the insoluble fraction by centrifugation followed by ultrafiltration through Microcon-3 (cut-off size, approximately 3 kDa) columns (Amicon). The flavins present in the filtrate were either further purified by extraction into phenol and returned to the aqueous phase by adding ether as described (19Koziol J. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 18: 253-285Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar) or analyzed without phenol extraction. The flavin solution was dried with a Speed-Vac concentrator, dissolved in 50% methanol, and analyzed by TLC on a silica gel 60 plate (Selecto Scientific) using 5% Na2HPO4 as a developing solvent (20Fazekas A.G. Kokai K. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 18: 385-398Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). 50% methanol solutions of FAD, FMN, and riboflavin (Sigma) were used as reference compounds. Flavin spots were detected by UV illumination. Spectral analyses were performed using a Shimadzu UV-1601PC diode array spectrophotometer and 1-cm quartz cuvettes. A Klett-Summerson photoelectric colorimeter (Klett Manufacturing Co.) with red filter was used to measure the absorbance of anaerobically grown R. sphaeroides cultures. The amounts of protein-bound FAD were determined based upon the assumption that absorptivity of 11.3 mm−1 cm−1 at 450 nm, which is characteristic of free FAD (19Koziol J. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 18: 253-285Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar), is equal to that of the protein-bound FAD. The protein concentration was measured with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The protein purity was estimated based on SDS-PAGE. The stoichiometry of binding of FAD to purified AppA was estimated as follows. Exogenous FAD was incubated with the equimolar amount (38.4 μm) of the purified amino-terminal fragment of AppA (150-μl reaction volume) for 30 min at room temperature. The mixture was diluted with 250 μl of PBS, loaded into a Microcon-3 concentrator and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 25 min. The concentrations of FAD were determined in the filtrate and retentate, based upon absorption at 450 nm. The amount of bound FAD (first estimate) was calculated based upon the amounts of FAD in the original protein sample, filtrate, and retentate. The retentate (200 μl) was further diluted with 4 volumes of PBS and concentrated as above-described, and the amount of bound FAD was calculated (second estimate). The average of the first and the second estimates from each experiment was taken. To gain insight into the biochemical properties of AppA, we intended to purify this protein by using an E. coli overexpression system. For this purpose, the appA gene was cloned into the overexpression vector pGEX-2TK to produce plasmid pGappN (Fig.1). The latter construct encodes the GST fused to the fifth amino acid residue of the AppA protein, expression of the fusion being controlled by Ptac . The GST::AppA fusion protein was overproduced in E. coli strain DH5α following induction by IPTG (Fig.2, lane 1). Employing the standard protocol resulted in the production of insoluble protein (not shown). Numerous attempts to obtain the protein in a soluble form were undertaken (see “Materials and Methods”); however the GST::AppA fusion was always produced in insoluble form,i.e. as inclusion bodies. To test whether the GST tag adversely affected solubility, the AppA protein was translationally fused to the amino-terminal residues of LacZα and overexpressed under the control of Plac (Fig. 1, plasmid pLappA). The LacZ′::AppA protein was overproduced in strain DH5α (pLappA) and found only as inclusion bodies (Fig.3 A). Several attempts to renature AppA from the denatured inclusion bodies were undertaken (21Rainer R. Hauke L. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). However, none of the various protocols produced satisfactory results (data not shown), possibly because proper refolding of denatured AppA required the simultaneous presence of associated cofactors, should they exist. We therefore set about to identify these possible cofactors.Figure 3A, AppA-enriched inclusion bodies.Lane 1, partially purified inclusion bodies from DH5α(pLappA), separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coumassie Blue;lane 2, molecular mass standards. Numbers at the right correspond to the molecular mass (in kDa). B, spectrum of the acidic acetone extract of AppA-enriched inclusion bodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We observed that E. coli cells overproducing AppA turned yellow upon induction. To investigate the basis of this phenomenon, we partially purified the AppA-containing inclusion bodies from strain DH5α(pLappA) to 80–85% purity as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig.3 A). These inclusion bodies retained their yellow coloration, suggesting the presence of a cofactor(s) associated with AppA. The inclusion bodies were extracted with acidic acetone solution, and the spectrum of the extract consisted of multiple, apparently overlapping peaks, indicative of the presence of several potential cofactors associated with AppA (Fig. 3 B). The major absorption peaks observed were at 365, 412, 440, and 466 nm. We anticipated that some of these peaks could belong to a flavin(s),e.g. the absorption peaks of FMN dissolved in acidic acetone are at approximately 362, 442, and a shoulder at 466 nm (data not shown). To test for the presence of noncovalently bound flavin, the AppA-enriched inclusion bodies were resuspended in PBS buffer and boiled. The yellow pigment was released and subjected to spectroscopic analysis. The absorption peaks characteristic of a flavin were observed, thus confirming the presence of a noncovalently bound flavin (see below). Additional compounds were present in the extract of the AppA-enriched inclusion bodies, and their analysis will be presented elsewhere. Below we focus on the characterization of the flavin associated with AppA. No significant similarity between AppA and known flavoproteins present in the data bases was detected by primary sequence comparisons. We therefore set about to identify the flavin binding domain(s) of AppA by constructing a series of carboxyl-terminal deletion derivatives differing in length by approximately 25–65 amino acids (Fig. 1). These derivatives were overexpressed as GST fusion proteins, GST::AppA′ (Fig. 2), and their coloration was noted. The proteins, progressively shortened from the AppA carboxyl terminus, were all yellow up to residue 124 (Fig. 1, plasmid pGapNae). Deletion of the 46 amino-terminal residues of AppA from the GST::AppA fusion (Fig. 1, plasmid pGapΔSm) resulted in a colorless protein. We therefore concluded that the flavin binding domain of AppA is confined to residues 5–124. To rule out the possible involvement of the GST moiety in flavin binding or in the stabilization of an AppA-flavin complex, we constructed and overproduced the 120-residue AppA derivative lacking the GST-tag (Fig. 1, plasmid pLapNae). This derivative retained the yellow coloration, suggesting that GST was not involved in flavin association and that the AppA domain between residues 5 and 124 was sufficient for flavin binding. To further define the boundary of this domain, we constructed an AppA derivative truncated at residue 84 (Fig.1, plasmid pLapNar). This protein was found to be colorless, which suggested that the boundary of the flavin binding domain lies between residues 84 and 124. The GST::AppA fusion protein containing the minimal flavin binding domain was overproduced in strain DH5α(pGapNae) grown at room temperature under moderate induction (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1–2). Under these conditions, the fusion protein was produced predominantly in the soluble form (Fig. 4 A, lane 3). It was purified by one-step affinity chromatography with glutathione-Sepharose. The amino-terminal derivative of AppA was released from the resin by thrombin, whose cleavage site is positioned at the junction of GST and AppA. The resulting amino-terminal derivative appeared as two closely positioned bands after separation by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4 A, lane 4). The band sizes are in the range of 15–17 kDa, i.e. slightly larger than the 14 kDa, which was anticipated, relying on the amino acid sequence. The reason for the double band was not investigated. We estimated that the amino-terminal domain of AppA was purified to at least 90% purity. The spectrum of this protein preparation appeared to be typical of a flavoprotein, with absorption maxima at 266, 280, 290, 356, 380, 412, and 452 nm. The minor absorption peak at 412 nm suggested that some portion of the flavin is present in the partially reduced, semiquinone form, despite the presence of an aerobic environment and the absence of exogenously added reductants (Fig. 4 B). The nature of the flavin cofactor was determined by TLC of the flavin extracted from the heat-denatured protein. The extracted flavin had a mobility identical to that of FAD (data not shown). FAD content in the purified amino-terminal fragment of AppA was 0.58 ± 0.09 mol/mol of protein. Because repetitive resin washes resulted in visible loss of yellow pigment, we determined the stoichiometry of FAD binding using exogenously added FAD. At saturating concentration of FAD, 1 mol of the amino-terminal domain of AppA was found to bind 0.89 ± 0.10 mol of FAD, suggesting that 1 mol of the amino-terminal fragment of AppA is capable of binding 1 mol of FAD. To gain insight into the role of the FAD binding on AppA function, we constructed an in-frame deletion (residues 5 to 190) derivative of AppA, which lacked the entire FAD binding domain (Fig. 5 A, plasmid p484-Nco5Δ). The truncated protein was expressed from the intact upstream regulatory region of appA to enable a direct comparison with the plasmid containing the full-lengthappA. Plasmid p484-Nco5Δ was introduced into the AppA null mutant, APP11. The resulting strain as well as strains carrying in trans the full-length appA gene in plasmid p484-Nco5 or the vector pRK415 alone (Fig. 5 A) were tested for their ability to transit from aerobic to anaerobic photosynthetic conditions. Strain APP11(pRK415) has an extensive lag phase before resuming growth under anaerobic photosynthetic conditions, and its subsequent growth is very slow (Fig. 5 B, trace 3), in line with our earlier observations (7Gomelsky M. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 128-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, strain APP11(p484-Nco5) performed the aerobic-to-anaerobic transition at least as efficiently as the wild type 2.4.1 (Fig. 5 B, trace 1). Surprisingly, the transition of strain APP11(p484-Nco5Δ) was only slightly impaired as compared with that of APP11(p484-Nco5) (Fig. 5 B, trace2). This suggested that the function of AppA in the transition of R. sphaeroides from aerobic to anaerobic photosynthetic conditions is generally preserved despite the absence of the entire FAD binding domain. Therefore FAD binding does not appear to be essential for AppA function, at least under these experimental conditions. It should be mentioned that the appA gene derivatives were present in 4 to 6 copies/cell. Therefore, an increased abundance of these derivatives over the physiological concentration of AppA could serve to have masked the extent of the impairment resulting from the absence of the FAD binding domain in the deletion derivative (see also “Discussion”). Searching the data bases for proteins similar to the FAD binding domain of AppA, i.e.residues 5–124, revealed two entries present in the sequences of the genomes of E. coli and Synechocystis sp.,i.e. F403 and Srl1694, respectively (Fig.6).

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Recently, the importin-β-like protein CAS (cellularapoptosis susceptibility protein) fromXenopus and HeLa cells has been identified as a recycling factor for importin-α that mediates export of the protein from the nucleus to allow its participation in further rounds of import (13Kutay U. Bischoff F. Kostka S. Kraft R. Görlich D. Cell. 1997; 90: 1061-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The high degree of conservation of nuclear transport pathways between yeast and higher eukaryotes, combined with the genetic tractability of yeast, has made Saccharomyces cerevisiae a valuable tool for the identification of new transport factors as well as the elucidation of functional interactions between known factors (reviewed in Ref. 14Corbett A.H. Silver P.A. Microbiol. Revs. 1997; 61: 193-211Google Scholar). A search of the completed S. cerevisiae genome identifiedCSE1 as the potential yeast homologue of the CAS gene. The predicted protein products of the two genes are 40% identical (13Kutay U. Bischoff F. Kostka S. Kraft R. Görlich D. Cell. 1997; 90: 1061-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar).CSE1 is an essential gene that was originally recovered in a screen for mutations that affect chromosome segregation (15Xiao Z.

Fitzgerald-Hayes M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4691-4702Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Here we show that Cse1p is required for export of Srp1p from the nucleus and that the two proteins interact in a GTP-dependent manner, as expected for a receptor-substrate export complex. The cse1-1 strain was a gift from M. Fitzgerald-Hayes (University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA), and the rat3-1 strain was from C. Cole (Dartmouth Medical School). The srp1-31 andsrp1-49 strains have been previously published (17Yano R. Oakes M.L. Tabb M.M. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6880-6884Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), as haveprp20-1 and rna1-1 (47Atkinson N.S. Dunst R.W. Hopper A.K. Mol. Cell.

To integrateCSE1 tagged with GFP at the C terminus, a 2.7-kilobase pairPstI/KpnI fragment of pPS1536 (CEN TRP CSE1-GFP (18Taura T. Krebber H. Silver P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7427-7432Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar)) lacking the promoter and first 954 coding base pairs ofCSE1 was cloned into pRS304, generating pPS1610. This plasmid was then linearized by BstEII digestion and was transformed into PSY580 (MATa, ura3-52, leu2Δ1, trp1-63). Trp+ transformants were selected, and integration at theCSE1 locus was verified by PCR analysis of the genomic DNA of the integrated strain (PSY1262). The integratedcse1-1-GFP strain (PSY1263) was constructed by transformingBstEII linearized pPS1610 into cse1-1(MATα, ura3-52, ade2-101, his3-11, 15, trp1Δ901). The continued cold sensitivity of the resulting strain was demonstrated by its inability to grow at 15 °C, and proper integration was checked by PCR. CSE1-GFP was similarly integrated intosrp1-31 (MATα, ura3-52, leu2-3, ade2-101, his3-11, 15, trp1Δ901) and srp1-49 (MATα, ura3-52, leu2-3, ade2-101, his3-11, 15, trp1Δ901) strains, creating PSY1264 and PSY1265, respectively. Integrated Crm1/Xpo1-GFP (PSY1266) and Sxm1-GFP (PSY1267) were constructed by T. Taura and M. Damelin, respectively, using similar strategies as for the Cse1-GFP strain. The galactose-induced GFP-β-galactosidase fusion protein was produced from pPS1612. Srp1p was localized in CSE1and cse1-1 strains at 30 and 15 °C (12-h shift) using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 30 min, washed in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, and resuspended in P solution (0.1m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 1.2 msorbitol). Cell walls were digested by incubation at 30 °C with 0.3 mg/ml zymolyase, 25 mm dithiothreitol, and cells were applied to slides precoated with 0.3% polylysine. Cells were permeabilized by treatment with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in P solution and blocked with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in PBS. Rabbit polyclonal anti-importin-α antibodies (gift from D. Görlich, Zentrum für Molekulare Biologie der Universität Heidelberg, Germany) were used at a dilution of 1:1000 overnight. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used at 1:1000; 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenyl-inadole (1 μg/ml) was used to stain DNA. To make a GST-Cse1p expression plasmid, the CSE1 open reading frame was PCR amplified, andBamHI and XhoI sites were introduced at the ends using Vent polymerase with primers JKH38 (5′-CGGGATCCATGTCCGATTTGGAAACCGTAGC-3′) and JKH31 (5′-CCGCTCGAGTTAATTACCAACTAATAATTG-3′). The PCR product was digested with BamHI and AvaI and was cloned into theBamHI/XhoI sites of pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to generate pPS1611. GST-Cse1p was expressed from pPS1611 inompT − Escherichia coli by 3 h isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.1 mm) induction at 30 °C and was purified by binding to glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and elution with 50 mm Tris·Cl, pH 8.0, 5 mm reduced glutathione. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against full-length GST-Cse1p (Covance Research Products, Inc.). The antibody was used at a 1:5000 dilution for immunoblotting. 100-ml cultures of Cse1-GFP or cse1-1-GFP strains were grown in rich medium to approximately 2 × 107 cells/ml and then were pelleted and washed once with water. Cells were lysed in 250 μl of ice-cold PBSMT (2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS) plus protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 μg/ml each pepstatin A, leupeptin, aprotinin, and chymostatin) using glass beads in a FastPrep bead beater (Savant). After lysis, 500 μl more of PBSMT were added, and lysates were clarified by two 10-min microcentrifuge spins at 4 °C. Anti-GFP beads were prepared by incubating 300 μl of IgG-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 50% slurry in PBS) with 100 μl 1 mg/ml rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibodies (gift of J. Kahana) for 15 min on a room temperature rocker. Beads were washed three times with PBS, ending with a 50% slurry. 10 μl of anti-GFP beads were used to immunoprecipitate GFP-tagged proteins from 250 μl of lysate (approximately 1 mg/ml total protein concentration by Bio-Rad protein assay) by rocking at 4 °C for 1 h. The GTP analogue GMPPNP (Sigma) was added to some lysates along with the beads (1 mm GMPPNP/2 mmMgCl2). Beads were washed four times with 500 μl of ice-cold PBSMT and once with 500 μl of ice-cold PBSM (2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA in PBS). Samples were prepared for gel analysis by adding 50 μl of 1× SDS sample buffer and boiling for 2 min. Anti-GFP immunoprecipitates were resolved in 8 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar), and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using standard techniques (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Chanda V.B. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998Google Scholar). Anti-GFP antibodies were used at a 1:4000 dilution, and anti-importin-α antibodies were used at a 1:2000 dilution. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used at a 1:5000 dilution, and immunoreactive bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Renaissance kit, NEN Life Science Products). CSE1-GFP andcse1-1-GFP strains were grown in rich medium to 1 × 107 cells/ml. For testing cold sensitivity, strains were shifted to 15 °C for 6 h; for temperature sensitivity, strains were shifted to 37 °C for 1 or 2 h. 1-ml culture aliquots were spun down; cells were washed once with water and examined immediately under a fluorescence microscope (Nikon) using a GFP-specific filter. Images were captured using Metamorph imaging software on the autoscale setting. By amino acid sequence similarity, Cse1p is the closest CAS protein homologue in S. cerevisiae. We sought to determine whether it is also a functional homologue, that is, whether Cse1p is the recycling factor that returns Srp1p to the cytoplasm after it enters the nucleus along with a classical NLS-containing substrate. To address this question, we first examined the localization of Srp1p in the cold-sensitive cse1-1 strain by indirect immunofluorescence. In wild type cells at 30 °C, anti-Srp1p staining shows a diffuse pattern throughout the cell (Fig.1 A), indicative of its continued movement in and out of the nucleus. At 15 °C, some wild type cells show a partial accumulation of Srp1p in the nucleus, suggesting that export is slowed in the cold. However, they still retain significant cytoplasmic Srp1p signal (Fig. 1 G). In contrast, even at 30 °C, cse1-1 cells show significant accumulation of Srp1p in the nucleus (Fig. 1 D); at the nonpermissive temperature of 15 °C, anti-Srp1p signal is restricted to the nucleus in virtually 100% of the cells (Fig. 1 J). This result implies that Cse1p plays a role in the nuclear export of Srp1p. Although cse1-1 cells show nuclear accumulation of Srp1p even at the permissive temperature, they do not grow significantly slower than wild type cells at 30 °C (data not shown). This apparent contradiction may be explained by the fact that Srp1p appears to be a very highly expressed protein. Thus, even if a majority of the Srp1p in a cell is nuclear at the permissive temperature, its rate of recycling to the cytoplasm may be sufficient to allow nearly normal rates of nuclear import and population doubling. To gain further evidence that Cse1p is the export receptor for Srp1p, we localized Cse1p in strains in which the endogenous CSE1or cse1-1 locus was replaced with sequence encoding Cse1p with GFP fused to its C terminus. The integration strategy was such that the fusion protein is the sole form of Cse1p expressed in these strains (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig.2 shows the endogenous Cse1 and cse1-1 proteins detected by immunoblotting with anti-Cse1p antibodies (lanes 1 and 3) and their respective GFP fusion proteins visualized by blotting with anti-Cse1p (lanes 2 and4) or anti-GFP (lanes 6 and 8) antibodies. The predicted molecular masses of endogenous Cse1p/cse1-1p and the GFP fusion proteins are 109 and 135 kDa, respectively. Cse1p migrates slightly faster than expected on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, running closer to the 100-kDa marker than the 110-kDa marker (Fig.2, lanes 1 and 3). There is an approximately 115-kDa protein that also reacts with the anti-Cse1p antibody in all lysates (Fig. 2, lanes 1–4). We do not know the identity of this band, but it is a formal possibility that it could be another importin-β-like protein. The sequenced yeast genome predicts at least two potential homologues, Lph2p and YGL241W, which would migrate at this approximate molecular size. The integrated Cse1-GFP strain showed no growth defects compared with its parental strain (data not shown), indicating that the fusion protein was completely functional. Furthermore, when Cse1-GFP was integrated into cse1-1, the resulting strain retained its cold sensitivity (data not shown), confirming that the integration strategy did not eliminate the originalcse1-1 mutation. The wild type and mutant fusion proteins were localized by fluorescence microscopy. Cse1-GFP shows a strong punctate nuclear envelope localization (Fig. 3 A,top panels), similar to that normally observed for NPC proteins (e.g. see Ref. 21Davis L.I. Fink G.R. Cell. 1990; 61: 965-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The association of Cse1-GFP with nuclear pores was confirmed by localizing the fusion protein in arat3-1 strain. This strain has a defect in mRNA export at high temperatures and exhibits clustering of NPCs at one or a few regions of the nuclear envelope at all temperatures (22Li O. Heath C.V. Amberg D.C. Dockendorff T.C. Copeland C.S. Snyder M. Cole C.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 401-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 B, Cse1-GFP also shows a clustering pattern inrat3-1 cells, indicating that the localization seen in wild type cells represents authentic NPC association. Most of the yeast importin-β-like proteins examined thus far show a similar concentration at nuclear pores but with varying degrees of background cytoplasmic and nuclear localization (23Aitchison J.D.

For Cse1-GFP, the non-pore-associated signal was essentially undetectable. The mutant cse1-1-GFP protein also localized to the nuclear envelope but showed higher intranuclear signal than the wild type fusion protein (Fig.3 A, lower panels) at both 30 and 15 °C, suggesting that the mutant protein cannot exit the nucleus as well as wild type Cse1p. Similar intranuclear accumulation of Cse1-GFP was seen in aprp20-1 strain shifted to the nonpermissive temperature of 37 °C (Fig. 3 C, middle panels). ThePRP20 gene product is the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Gsp1p (30Aebi M. Clark M.W. Vijayraghavan U. Abelson J. Mol. Gen.

The accumulation of Cse1-GFP inside the nucleus of prp20-1 cells is indicative of a requirement for Gsp1p-GTP for translocation of Cse1p through the NPC. We also localized Cse1-GFP in rna1-1 cells. RNA1 encodes the GTPase-activating protein for Gsp1p (37Becker J. Melchior F. Gerke V. Bischoff F.R. Ponstigl H. Wittinghoffer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11860-11865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 38Bischoff F.R. Krebber H. Kempf T. Hermes I. Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The mutant rna1-1 protein fails to stimulate Gsp1p-GTP hydrolysis, and thereforerna1-1 cells have elevated levels of Gsp1p-GTP (39Corbett A.H. Koepp D.M. Lee M.S. Schlenstedt G. Hopper A.K. Silver P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In therna1-1 strain, the NPC localization of Cse1-GFP was diminished, and the protein was localized throughout the cell (Fig.3 C, right panels). Because Srp1p shows a similar diffuse localization, this result may indicate that, in the presence of Gsp1p-GTP, Cse1p constitutively associates with its transport substrate. We next looked for a biochemical interaction between Cse1p and Srp1p, which would be expected if the two form a genuine receptor-substrate export complex. Rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibodies bound to IgG-Sepharose beads were used to immunoprecipitate Cse1-GFP from lysates prepared from the integrated Cse1-GFP and cse1-1-GFP strains (Fig. 4 A, top panel, lanes 4–9). Co-immunoprecipitation of Srp1p was assayed by immunoblotting with anti-importin-α antibodies (Fig. 4 A,bottom panel, lanes 4–9). In the absence of any nucleotide analogue, Cse1-GFP immunoprecipitates contained only background levels of Srp1p, similar to a control in which beads were incubated with lysate that did not contain any GFP fusion protein (Fig. 4 A, compare lanes 4 and 6). However, when the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue GMPPNP (1 mm) was added to the Cse1-GFP lysate, co-immunoprecipitation of Srp1p was vastly stimulated (Fig. 4 A, compare lanes 5 and 7). Srp1p did not co-immunoprecipitate with two other importin-β-like proteins expressed as C-terminal GFP fusions (Xpo1-GFP and Sxm1-GFP) or with a fusion of GFP to the N terminus of β-galactosidase (Fig.4 B, lanes 4–9). Therefore, the interaction between Cse1-GFP and Srp1p is specific; it does not reflect an affinity of Srp1p either for GFP or for multiple members of the importin-β family. The failure of Srp1p to interact with Crm1/Xpo1-GFP is especially significant because Crm1p/Xpo1p is also an export receptor, known to mediate export of proteins that contain leucine-rich nuclear export signals (40Stade K. Ford C. Guthrie C. Weis K. Cell. 1997; 90: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar, 41Neville M. Stutz F. Lee L. Davis L.I. Rosbash M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 767-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The CAS protein has been shown to bind cooperatively to importin-α and RanGTP (13Kutay U. Bischoff F. Kostka S. Kraft R. Görlich D. Cell. 1997; 90: 1061-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Yeast cell lysates prepared under normal conditions would be expected to contain Gsp1p primarily in the GDP-bound state due to the GTPase activating activity of Rna1p. The addition of the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue GMPPNP to these lysates should restore the GTP-bound population of Gsp1p. The fact that the Cse1-GFP/Srp1p interaction only occurs in the presence of GMPPNP implies that it represents a Gsp1p-GTP-dependent export complex. Srp1p did not co-immunoprecipitate from lysates from cse1-1-GFP expressing cells even in the presence of GMPPNP (Fig. 4 A,lane 9). This result suggests that the cse1-1mutation affects the formation of the Cse1p-Srp1p export complex and provides an explanation for the previously observed suppression ofcse1-1 by high copy SRP1 (15Xiao Z. McGrew J.T. Schroeder A.J. Fitzgerald-Hayes M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4691-4702Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thecse1-1 strain contains a mutation that changes amino acid residue 220 from aspartate to asparagine (D220N). 2A. Schroeder, personal communication. This residue lies outside the conserved N-terminal Ran binding motif that is shared by importin-β family members; However, the experimentally determined Ran binding domain of importin-β extends beyond this conserved region (42Chi N.C. Adam E.J.H. Adam S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6818-6822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 43Kutay U. Izzaurralde E. Bischoff F.R. Mattaj I.W. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1153-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the cse1-1 mutation disrupts Gsp1p-GTP binding and thus interferes with the formation of a cooperative Cse1p-Srp1p-Gsp1p-GTP complex. Alternatively, the D220N mutation may identify a region of Cse1p that is directly involved in binding to Srp1p. Cse1-GFP was also integrated into two strains containing mutations inSRP1, srp1-31, and srp1-49, and similar immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out using lysates from these strains. Like wild type Srp1p, the mutant srp1-49 protein co-immunoprecipitated with Cse1-GFP in the presence of GMPPNP, but the srp1-31 protein did not (Fig. 4 B, compare lanes 7and 9). Note that the level of Cse1-GFP expression in thesrp1-31 strain was decreased relative to the wild type andsrp1-49 strains but that longer exposures of the immunoblot still did not visualize any co-precipitating srp1-31 protein. Srp1p contains a central domain consisting of eight 42-amino acid tandem repeats of the armadillo (arm) motif found in a family of proteins that includes the Drosophila armadillo protein and the vertebrate β-catenin and plakoglobin proteins (17Yano R. Oakes M.L. Tabb M.M. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6880-6884Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). X-ray crystal structures have recently been determined for the arm repeats of β-catenin (44Huber A.H. Nelson W.J. Weis W.I. Cell. 1997; 90: 871-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) and importin/karyopherin-α (45Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar); both structures exhibit an extensive shallow surface groove that seems to function as a specific protein-protein interaction module. In the case of importin/karyopherin-α, the surface groove constitutes the binding site for positively charged NLS peptides (45Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). A conserved 41-amino acid domain not present in the crystallized protein has been identified as the importin-β binding domain (46Görlich D. Henklein P. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1810-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The srp1-49 mutation lies within the first arm repeat (17Yano R. Oakes M.L. Tabb M.M. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6880-6884Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), whereas the srp1-31 mutation falls just N-terminal to the start of the arm domain (17Yano R. Oakes M.L. Tabb M.M. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6880-6884Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and C-terminal to the importin-β binding domain. The different interaction properties of the two mutant Srp1 proteins may indicate that the srp1-31 mutation lies within a region of the protein that is required for binding to Cse1p, but further studies will be required to elucidate the precise domain in Srp1p that interacts with Cse1p. srp1-31 cells exhibit a strong nuclear import defect for classical NLS-containing substrates, whereas srp1-49 cells show a much weaker defect (16Loeb J.D.L. Schlenstedt G. Pellman D. Kornitzer D. Silver P.A. Fink G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7647-7651Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This observation is consistent with the failure of the srp1-31 protein to bind to Cse1p, but paradoxically, the mutant protein does not mislocalize to the nucleus. 3J. K. Hood and P. A. Silver, unpublished results. This contradiction may be explained if the srp1-31 mutation abrogates binding to both Cse1p and importin-β. In this case, the mutant protein would never enter the nucleus and thus could not be trapped by a lack of interaction with its recycling factor. The CAS protein has been shown to export importin-α in metazoan cells. Here we present evidence that Cse1p, the S. cerevisiae CAS homologue, is the export receptor for Srp1p, which is the yeast importin-α protein. We have demonstrated a biochemical interaction between Cse1p and Srp1p that requires the presence of GTP and have identified mutations in both Cse1p and Srp1p that abolish this interaction. The facility of genetic and biochemical analysis in yeast will make it an excellent system for further study of the importin-α recycling pathway.

Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1047-1052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). GRK2 is the most ubiquitous member of this kinase family and has been shown to play a key regulatory physiological role in the heart and other tissues (3Chuang T.T. Iacovelli L. Sallese M. DeBlasi A.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). GRK2 may also play a role in facilitating the transient agonist-induced GPCR internalization allowing receptor dephosphorylation and recycling (5Ruiz-Gómez A. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol.

This fact, together with the recently suggested participation of GRKs and arrestins in the GPCR-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (8Daaka Y. Luttrell L.H. Ahn S. Della Roca G.J.

Changes in GRK2 expression may therefore alter the efficacy of GPCR signal transduction systems. In this regard, GRK2 expression levels have been reported to increase in human heart failure (10Ungerer M. Böhm M. Elce J.S. Erdmann E. Lohse M.J.

Despite recent advances in the understanding of the mechanisms regulating the activity and subcellular distribution of GRK2 (1Böhm S.K. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W.

In this study, we sought to characterize the degradation process of GRK2 protein and its potential modulation. Our results clearly show that GRK2 is rapidly degraded by the proteasome pathway and that kinase degradation is modulated by activation of β2-adrenergic receptors (β2AR). Regulation of GRK2 stability may provide an important mechanism for modulating the cellular levels of this kinase and contribute to the regulation of desensitization/resensitization patterns of GPCR, as suggested by the fact that blockade of GRK2 degradation alters β2AR signaling as well as receptor internalization. HEK-293 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were transfected with pCDNA3-GRK2, pCDNA3-GRK2-K220R, and/or pws636-SF β2AR by the calcium phosphate precipitation method and selected for stable expression as described (5Ruiz-Gómez A. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9601-9604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In some experiments, cells were transiently transfected as reported (14Murga C. Esteban N. Ruiz-Gómez A. Mayor F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 24-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) with different combinations of GRK2 and β2AR, as well as constitutively active β2AR (15Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or a COOH-terminal truncated mutant (amino acids 1–354) of the mouse β2AR. 3A. Ruiz-Gómez, unpublished data. For metabolic labeling, cells were kept for 2 h in methionine and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and then incubated for 15–30 min in DMEM supplemented with 250 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine labeling mixture (NEN Life Science Products).The plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and chased for the indicated times in DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum. The proteolysis inhibitors lactacystin (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), ALLN (Sigma), and leupeptin (Boehringer Mannheim) were added 90 min before metabolic labeling and maintained during the chase periods (16Krappmann D. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6716-6726Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Pulse-labeled cells expressing β2AR were challenged with isoproterenol (Sigma) or vehicle during chase periods in DMEM supplemented with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and 1 mm ascorbic acid (Sigma). Cells were washed and lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% deoxycholate, with protease inhibitors) for 120 min at 4 °C with continuous rocking and then centrifuged (15,000 × g, 15 min). Protein extracts were immunoprecipitated with the specific GRK2 polyclonal antibody AbFP1 (12Murga C. Ruiz-Gómez A. Garcı́a-Higuera I. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE. After fluorography (Amplify, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), the gel was dried and exposed at −70 °C. Band density was quantitated by laser densitometric analysis. Cells lysates were obtained exactly as described (12Murga C. Ruiz-Gómez A. Garcı́a-Higuera I. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and resolved in 7% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with GRK2 Ab9 polyclonal antibody raised against recombinant GRK2 as described (5Ruiz-Gómez A. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9601-9604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 12Murga C. Ruiz-Gómez A. Garcı́a-Higuera I. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and the blot was developed using a chemiluminiscent method (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In other experiments, blots were analyzed using the GRK2 polyclonal antibodies AbFP2 or affinity-purified Ab1 (17Chuang T.T. Pompili E. Paolucci L. Sallese M. De Gioia L. Salmona M. De Blasi A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 533-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), raised against different regions of bovine GRK2 (see “Results”). Densitometric analysis of the blots was performed as above. Bovine GRK2 was overexpressed in Sf9 cells using the baculovirus expression system and purified as described previously (12Murga C. Ruiz-Gómez A. Garcı́a-Higuera I. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Purification of a 20 S proteasome (MCP) from rat liver was as described (18Arribas J. Castaño J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21165-21171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Arribas J. Castaño J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13969-13973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thein vitro proteolytic assay was performed by incubating 2 μg of purified MCP with 1.25 μg of GRK2 exactly as reported (18Arribas J. Castaño J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21165-21171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,19Arribas J. Castaño J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13969-13973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining. Alternatively, GRK2 samples (10 μg) undigested or following digestion with proteasome for 60 min were injected on a gel filtration HPLC column (TSK 5000, Beckman, Palo Alto, CA) (18Arribas J. Castaño J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21165-21171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions in the ∼80-kDa range were tested for either the presence of GRK2 and proteolytic fragments in Western blot or for GRK2 activity as detailed below. GRK2 samples obtained by gel filtration on an HPLC column (see above) were diluted 1:10, and GRK2 activity was assessed by the rhodopsin phosphorylation assay as described (12Murga C. Ruiz-Gómez A. Garcı́a-Higuera I. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Relative GRK2 activity was estimated by densitometric analysis of the autoradiography. HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method with different combinations of expression vectors for GRK2, β2AR, and HA-ubiquitin (20Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with isoproterenol or vehicle for 30 min, and ubiquitin conjugates were purified by immunoprecipitation with a specific monoclonal antibody against the HA epitope (Boehringer Mannheim). The presence of ubiquitinated GRK2 was subsequently analyzed by Western blotting with Ab9 antibody as described above. Similar GRK2 and ubiquitin expression levels were confirmed in cell lysates by dot blot and Western blot analysis using their specific antibodies. β2AR levels were determined by radioligand binding as described (5Ruiz-Gómez A. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9601-9604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). HEK-293 cells stably expressing GRK2 and β2AR or transiently transfected with GRK2 and wild-type β2AR or COOH-terminal truncated β2AR were subcultured (6 × 105 cells) for 12 h before preincubation with 30 μm lactacystin or vehicle (90 min, 37 °C) and maintained in its presence through the following steps. Subsequently, cells were incubated with 10 μm isoproterenol or vehicle (30 min, first challenge). Afterward, cells were extensively washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with DMEM for 30 min (resensitization period) before adding 10 μmisoproterenol (10 min, second challenge). Lysates were obtained and assessed in triplicate for cAMP levels as described (21Hough C. Fukamauchi F. Chuang D.M. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Data were corrected according to the total protein amount in each sample and compared with values obtained in control conditions (not treated with lactacystin and not undergoing the first challenge with agonist). Following preincubation with 30 μm lactacystin or vehicle (control) in DMEM for 3 h, cells were challenged with 0.1 or 1 μm isoproterenol for 2 min at 37 °C, washed by centrifugation, and labeled at 4 °C with M1 FLAG antibody. Receptor sequestration was then quantitated by flow cytometry essentially as described (5Ruiz-Gómez A. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9601-9604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The fraction of sequestered receptors was calculated by comparing the signal obtained in the absence or presence of agonist. The GRK2 degradation rate was measured by pulse and chase analysis using HEK-293 cells that stably express GRK2. In such cells, neither the subcellular localization pattern of the kinase nor the ratio between subcellular compartments was altered when compared with endogenous GRK2 (14Murga C. Esteban N. Ruiz-Gómez A. Mayor F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 24-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). A rapid decay in the 35S-labeled GRK2 immunoprecipitated by a specific kinase antibody is shown in Fig.1 A, indicating that GRK2 is a short-lived protein with a half-life estimated at ∼60 min. A similar value was obtained for the endogenous GRK2 in identical experiments performed in Jurkat cells (data not shown), ruling out the possibility that overexpression might alter the normal rate of kinase proteolysis. To ascertain which mechanism was responsible for the rapid GRK2 degradation, pulse and chase experiments were performed with specific inhibitors of different proteolytic pathways (Fig. 1 B). Treatment with the cysteine protease inhibitor ALLN clearly prevents GRK2 degradation after 4 h of chase when compared with control conditions, at concentrations (50 μm) in which it inhibits the proteasome pathway but not at doses (1 μm) in which only nonproteasomal proteases are blocked (22Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2169) Google Scholar), thus excluding the involvement of the latter. The presence of leupeptin, an inhibitor of protein degradation in lysosomes, did not alter GRK2 degradation. These results suggested that the proteasome pathway was involved in the rapid GRK2 proteolysis. Consistently, the addition of the highly specific proteasome inhibitor lactacystin fully blocks kinase degradation in intact cells (Fig. 1 B). To further address the role of the proteasome in regulating GRK2 stability, in vitro degradation experiments were conducted with recombinant GRK2 and purified 20 S proteasome from rat liver (18Arribas J. Castaño J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21165-21171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified MCP preparations were judged homogeneous by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 2 A). Under the conditions tested, recombinant GRK2 (indicated as the 80-kDa protein in Fig. 2 A) is indeed rapidly degraded, whereas GRK2 incubated for 2 h without MCP remains unaltered. To exclude the possibility that a minor contaminant protease present in the incubation could contribute to GRK2 proteolysis, we tested different MCP preparations for their ability to degrade GRK2, obtaining essentially the same results (data not shown). Moreover, different doses of the specific proteasome inhibitor lactacystin clearly prevent GRK2 cleavage as compared with control (Fig. 2 B). Altogether, our data indicate that the kinase is a target for the proteasome, in vivo as well as in vitro. Interestingly, our in vitro GRK2 degradation experiments reveal the presence of a ∼74-kDa band that appears as GRK2 decays (Fig. 2, A andC). This protein appears to represent an intermediate proteolytic product (also degraded by MCP following longer incubation times), whose formation is blunted in the presence of lactacystin (Fig.2 C). In a first attempt to determine whether the MCP initially digests the NH2- or the COOH-terminal region of GRK2 to yield the 74-kDa protein, we performed immunoblot analysis of GRK2 preparations incubated with or without MCP, using different GRK2 antibodies. Both intact GRK2 and the 74-kDa band are detected efficiently by the polyclonal antibody Ab9 raised against recombinant GRK2 and AbFP2, a polyclonal antibody against the COOH terminus (residues 436–689) (Fig. 2 C). Moreover, antibody Ab1, which recognizes a more restricted epitope (GRK2 residues 648–655) that would be eliminated in an initial COOH-terminal cleavage, yields the same results (Fig. 2 C, right panel), strongly suggesting that GRK2 is initially digested at its NH2terminus. The generation of the 74-kDa band as a result of GRK2 degradationin vitro raised the question of whether this cleavage product could be also observed in vivo. Fig.3 A indicates that the 74-kDa band is indeed immunodetected when measuring steady-state protein levels in cellular lysates from HEK-293 cells stably overexpressing GRK2 alone or with β2AR (Fig. 3 A, lanes 4 and 5), whereas it is undetectable in untransfected cells (Fig. 3 A, lane 1). Notably, the 74-kDa fragment seems to be more abundant in cells coexpressing GRK2 and a constitutively activated β2AR mutant (15Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (lane 2 versus lane 3 in Fig. 3 A). Moreover, we are able to immunoprecipitate the 74-kDa protein with a GRK2-specific antibody (Fig. 3 B) but not with a preimmune serum (data not shown), when cells are metabolically labeled for periods longer than those used in pulse and chase experiments. These data indicate that the partial digestion of GRK2 by the proteasome takes place in situ and suggest that receptor activation might play some role in the process to render this product. We next determined the functional activity of the 74-kDa fragment by testing its ability to phosphorylate rhodopsin, a well known GRK2 substrate (12Murga C. Ruiz-Gómez A. Garcı́a-Higuera I. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For this purpose, kinase samples, undigested or digested with MCP, were purified by HPLC chromatography to remove MCP prior to the phosphorylation assay. The eluted fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed in Western blot (Fig. 3 C). Most GRK2 was cleaved by MCP to yield the 74-kDa fragment. As can be seen in Fig. 3 D, MCP-digested fractions (open circles) have less capacity to phosphorylate rhodopsin than undigested fractions (filled circles). Samples treated with MCP still display undigested GRK2 (∼27%), which may account for the remaining activity. The decrease in activity (a 44% reduction) is lower, however, than that expected in such a case (a 73% reduction) indicating that the 74-kDa fragment can indeed phosphorylate rhodopsin, although with less efficiency than GRK2. To explore whether receptor activation can modulate kinase turnover, we treated HEK-293 cells stably coexpressing GRK2 and β2AR with the β-agonist isoproterenol (10 μm) or vehicle during different chase periods after35S metabolic labeling (Fig.4 A). Under control conditions (Fig. 4 A, −ISO), the levels of GRK2 decay essentially as described in cells expressing the kinase alone (see also Fig. 1 A). Agonist stimulation (Fig. 4 A,+ISO) clearly enhances the GRK2 degradation rate as compared with control (27% GRK2 remaining after 1 h of ISO treatmentversus 54% in untreated cells; p < 0.05, data indicate the means ± S.E. of three to five independent experiments). GRK2 half-life thus decreases from 60 min (basal conditions) to ∼30 min (stimulated turnover). The presence of lactacystin or ALLN completely abrogates GRK2 degradation in isoproterenol-treated cells (Fig. 4 B), as they do in unstimulated cells. This ruled out the possibility that the increase in kinase processing triggered by receptor stimulation might arise from the activation of an additional proteolytic pathway other than proteasome-dependent degradation. Most proteins targeted to the proteasome pathway undergo polyubiquitination (23Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2213) Google Scholar, 24Varshavsky A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). To investigate the possible role of ubiquitination in basal and induced degradation of GRK2 in intact cells, we transiently transfected HEK-293 cells with different combinations of a tagged ubiquitin construct, GRK2, and β2AR. In cells in which ubiquitin was overexpressed with the kinase and the receptor, a band smear corresponding to multi-ubiquitinated GRK2 (marked with a line in theright side of the upper panel in Fig.4 C) was clearly detected upon receptor stimulation with isoproterenol, whereas GRK2 ubiquitination was much lower in untreated cells (Fig. 4 C, upper panel). Taken together, our data suggest that the extent of GRK2 ubiquitination is stimulation-dependent and probably accounts for the enhanced agonist-induced kinase degradation by the proteasome pathway. Given that β2AR occupancy by agonist promotes very rapid translocation of GRK2 to the plasma membrane and kinase activation (1Böhm S.K. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. Biochem J. 1997; 322: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar,2Lohse M. Krasel C. Winstel R. Mayor Jr F. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1047-1052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 6Mayor F. Penela P. Ruiz-Gómez A. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1998; 8: 235-241Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 13DebBurman S.K. Ptasienski J. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22552-22562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we tested whether the activity of the kinase might also affect its turnover. To this end, HEK-293 cells stably expressing β2AR and a dominant-negative GRK2 mutant (GRK2-K220R) (25Kong G. Penn R. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13084-13087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were metabolically labeled and chased in the presense (Fig.4 D, lanes I) or absence (Fig. 4 D,lanes C) of isoproterenol. Agonist stimulation promotes no change in mutant kinase levels (Fig. 4 D). More surprisingly, the amount of GRK2-K220R does not appear to decay even after 8 h of chase in the absence of agonist (Fig. 4 D, upper panel), indicating that the mutant protein is far more stable than the wild type. The rapid and agonist-modulated degradation of GRK2 by the proteasome would provide a mechanism to regulate the cellular complement of GRK2 and, therefore, GPCR desensitization patterns. In this regard, we used HEK-293 cells stably expressing both β2AR and GRK2 to test the effects of blocking GRK2 degradation with the specific proteasome inhibitor lactacystin on the subsequent cell response to the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol and on the β2AR desensitization process. In control cells, agonist challenge promotes a 1.8 ± 0.1-fold increase in cAMP levels over basal values. Pretreatment with isoproterenol for 30 min induces the typical decrease in responsiveness to a subsequent agonist challenge (23 ± 7% decrease) (Fig.5, left panel) and also a decrease in GRK2 levels (45 ± 9% of control), consistent with our previous data. Interestingly, inhibition of GRK2 degradation with lactacystin results in a clear increase in GRK2 protein levels both in control and isoproterenol-pretreated cells (Fig. 5, inset,lanes 2 and 4) and reduces β2-adrenergic receptor signaling by 33 ± 2 and 44 ± 1%, respectively (Fig. 5, left panel). Because cellular β2AR levels remain unchanged with lactacystin treatments (see legend to Fig. 5), these data suggest that alteration of the kinase/receptor ratio clearly affects signal transduction. Other factors may also contribute to the reduction in β2AR signaling in the presence of lactacystin, because regulatory subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (26Lee H.-W. Smith L. Pettit G.R. Vinitsky A. Smith J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20973-20976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 27Lee H.-W. Smith L. Pettit G.R. Bingham-Smith J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 439-447PubMed Google Scholar) and other components of the transduction cascade could be degraded by the proteasome pathway. However, adenylyl cyclase activation by forskolin is not modified in the presence of lactacystin, and the same results were obtained in the presence of cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitors (data not shown). Moreover, lactacystin treatment does not affect cAMP production by a transiently transfected truncated β2AR, which lacks phosphorylation sites for GRK2 but retains those for cAMP-dependent protein kinase and its ability to modulate adenylyl cyclase (Fig. 5, left panel), indicating that changes in GRK2 levels have a direct and crucial effect in the observed alteration in β2AR responsiveness. Previous reports have provided evidence that GRK2 plays a facilitatory role in receptor internalization (5Ruiz-Gómez A. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9601-9604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 6Mayor F. Penela P. Ruiz-Gómez A. Trends Cardiovasc.

Consistently, the blocking of kinase degradation with lactacystin markedly enhanced (up to 2.6-fold) receptor sequestration after a short term (2 min) challenge with isoproterenol (Fig. 5, right panel). These results are in agreement with our previous report (5Ruiz-Gómez A. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9601-9604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and further indicate that the impairment of the normal kinase turnover has important functional consequences on receptor desensitization and internalization processes. Changes in the cellular complement of GRK2 can modulate the desensitization/resensitization processes of a variety of GPCR (7Ménard L. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Lin F.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4606-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that GRK2 displays a rapid turnover through the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway. This proteolytic pathway is responsible for the rapid degradation of an increasing number of cell cycle regulators and key signaling proteins (see Ref. 31Weissman A.M. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar for a recent review). Changes in the stability of proteins as a consequence of dysregulated proteasome complex activity can lead to an impairment in the cellular functions mediated by these proteins (31Weissman A.M. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In this line, our data indicate that GRK2 degradation is modulated by GPCR activation and that blocking of kinase degradation strongly affects its role as regulator of GPCR function. Proteins targeted to the proteasome pathway usually undergo polyubiquitination (23Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2213) Google Scholar, 24Varshavsky A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), although this is not an absolute requirement (16Krappmann D. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6716-6726Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 32Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Kameji T. Hayashi S. Igarashi K. Tamura T. Tanaka K. Ichichara A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 11623-11627Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We show that GRK2 ubiquitination and proteolysis by the proteasome pathway is increased upon agonist activation of GPCR, although the kinase also exhibits weak ubiquitination under unstimulated conditions, suggesting that common mechanisms can regulate signal-dependent and basal GRK2 degradation in contrast to Iκβα degradation (16Krappmann D. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6716-6726Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the ability of purified 20 S proteasome to digest GRK2 indicates that a direct interaction between the kinase and proteasome subunit(s) can occur. It is feasible that an undetermined structural motif in GRK2 contributes to target the protein to this degradation machinery, in addition to ubiquitination. In contrast to most proteasome substrates that undergo a complete and processive degradation, proteolytic processing of GRK2 by the proteasome yields a 74-kDa fragment that transiently accumulatesin vivo as well as in vitro. The generation of this product could only be a “marker” of the initial steps of GRK2 degradation, like the 42-kDa fragment of cyclin B (34Tokumoto T. Yamashita M. Tokumoto M. Katsu Y. Horiguchi R. Kajiura H. Nagahama Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and/or have an unknown physiological role. Consistent with the latter possibility, the 74-kDa fragment indeed displays kinase activity toward a G protein-coupled receptor substrate. Interestingly, its ability to phosphorylate rhodopsin is clearly lower than that of the full-length kinase. In this regard, it has been recently reported that GRK2 is also able to phosphorylate other proteins different from G protein-coupled receptors, such as tubulin (9Pitcher J.A. Hall R.A. Daaka Y. Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Hester S. Miller S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12316-12324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that the proteolytic removal of a NH2-terminal domain of GRK2 by the proteasome both alters the kinase efficacy toward GPCR and modifies kinase activity toward other cellular substrates. We provide evidence that β2AR activation promotes an increase in GRK2 ubiquitination and degradation. Several hypotheses can be considered to explain this observation. First, GRK2-mediated phosphorylation promotes arrestin binding to the agonist-activated receptor, leading to receptor uncoupling and internalization (1Böhm S.K. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. Biochem J. 1997; 322: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 5Ruiz-Gómez A. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24782-24789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Data suggest the formation of a multimolecular complex (receptor/GRK2/β-arrestin) at specialized locations of the plasma membrane (5Ruiz-Gómez A. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9601-9604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 35Aragay AM. Mellado M. Frade J.M.R. Martin A.M. Jimenez-Sainz M.C. Martinez A.C. Mayor Jr., F. Proc.

Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar) that will be internalized after recruitment of different proteins of the endocytic machinery. It is possible that interaction of GRK2 with molecules of this multimolecular complex plays a role in its signal-dependent degradation by locating the kinase in close proximity with the molecules responsible for its ubiquitination and/or allowing conformational changes that unmask kinase domains directly targeted for ubiquitination. In this regard, it is worth noting that the yeast G protein-coupled receptor Ste2p is ubiquitinated at the plasma membrane even if endocytosis is blocked (38Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 39Terrell J. Shih S. Dunn R. Hicke L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 193-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the higher level of GRK2 ubiquitination due to agonist receptor activation might result from second messenger-mediated mechanisms or as a consequence of stimulated GRK2 activity leading to phosphorylation of unknown factors different from GPCR or to transient increases in kinase autophosphorylation, improving GRK2 modification by ubiquitination. Data obtained with the GRK2-K220R mutant are consistent with a strong relationship between the stability of GRK2 and its cellular function; the slow turnover of GRK2-K220R as compared with wild-type GRK2 is largely unaffected by receptor activation, the mutant is deficient in kinase activity, and it strongly impairs β-arrestin binding and the subsequent internalization (1Böhm S.K. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. Biochem J. 1997; 322: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 28Ferguson S.S.G. Ménard L. Barak L.S. Koch W.J. Colapietro A.-M. Caron M.G. J. Biol.

Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Several recent reports suggest that both the extent and rate of receptor internalization as well as the pattern of desensitization/resensitization processes may vary depending on the cellular content of GRK2 and β-arrestin (7Ménard L. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Lin F.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 800-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 30Aramori I. Zhang J. Fergusson S.S.G.

Mayor Jr., F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2985-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Our data are consistent with these reports and, further, suggest that a tight regulation of GRK2 cellular levels by agonists is needed for normal receptor function and modulation. Indeed, the rise in GRK2 complement by blockade of its normal degradation pathway clearly enhanced the initial rate of receptor sequestration, according to the facilitatory role of GRK2 previously reported in this process (5Ruiz-Gómez A. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9601-9604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 28Ferguson S.S.G. Ménard L. Barak L.S. Koch W.J. Colapietro A.-M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24782-24789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). More interestingly, receptor response to agonists is markedly affected in these conditions, indicating that in our cellular system a moderate increase of GRK2 over its steady-state levels is enough to evoke a strong change in GPCR signaling, putting forward the relevance of an adequate ratio between the receptor and its regulatory proteins. In this context, it is tempting to suggest that the increased down-regulation of kinase levels observed after sustained GPCR stimulation would help to preserve some degree of response to additional activation by agonists. In this regard, it is worth noting that GRK2 levels rapidly decrease in several tissues during the rat perinatal period,2 a physiological situation characterized by a dramatic and prolonged surge in plasma catecholamines. On the other hand, the impaired protein degradation by the proteasome pathway described in pathological conditions such as hypothyroidism (41Mitch W.E. Goldberg A.L. New Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar) could explain the increased GRK2 levels detected by our laboratory in several rat hypothyroid tissues 4P. Penela, A. Muñoz, and F. Mayor, Jr., manuscript in preparation. and contribute to the reported attenuation of adrenergic responses in this situation. In summary, our results indicate that receptor activation leads not only to changes in GRK2 activity and subcellular localization but also promotes enhanced GRK2 proteolysis through a ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway. Activity-dependent regulation of GRK2 stability may provide an important mechanism for modulating its expression levels, contributing to the regulation of desensitization/resensitization patterns of GPCR. Changes in GRK2 levels promoted by the activation of a given receptor may also modify the efficacy of the cellular response to subsequent challenges by other agonists acting through different GPCR. This new pathway of receptor-dependent modulation of the stability of a regulatory protein may therefore have important physiological consequences.

This process has historically been thought to require nucleotide hydrolysis as a source of energy. We found, using hydrolysis-resistant GTP analogs and a mutant Ran unable to hydrolyze GTP, that transport of classical nuclear localization sequence containing substrate through the NPC and release of the substrate into the nucleus did not require hydrolysis of GTP by Ran. In fact, for movement of this type of import substrate into the nuclear interior we did not observe a requirement for hydrolysis of any nucleotide triphosphate. We did, however, find that a pool of free GTP (or its structural equivalent) must be added, probably because the GDP Ran that is added must be converted to GTP Ran during the import process. We found that a requirement for GTP hydrolysis can be restored to an import mixture consisting of recombinant import factors by the addition of RCC1, the Ran guanine nucleotide exchange factor.

Many nuclear proteins contain a nuclear localization sequence (NLS), 1The abbreviations used are: NLS, nuclear localization signal; NPC, nuclear pore complex; NTP, nucleoside 5′-triphosphate; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; NE, nuclear envelope; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DTT, dithiothreitol; AMP-PNP, adenylyl imidodiphosphate; GMP-PNP, guanylyl imidodiphosphate; GTPγS, guanosine-5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate); GDPβS, guanosine-5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate); wt, wild type. the classical type of which consists of either a single or bipartite stretch of primarily basic amino acids. The presence of an NLS on a reporter results in its rapid transport from the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and into the nuclear interior. This process can be reconstitutedin vitro using cells that have been treated with a low concentration of digitonin, which permeabilizes the plasma membrane to the passage of macromolecules but leaves the nuclear membrane intact (1Adam S.A. Sterne Marr R. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). Addition of cytosol as a source of import factors, a nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) as a source of energy, and import substrate to these permeabilized cells results in import of the substrate into the nucleus. From this cytosol, four import factors have been identified that together efficiently support nuclear import of a basic NLS-containing substrate in permeabilized cells in the absence of cytosol. The receptor for the classical or basic NLS (karyopherin/importin α), together with karyopherin/importin β1, targets the import substrate to the NPC (2Adam S.A. Gerace L.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Thus the addition of these two import factors alone to an in vitro import assay results in binding of import substrate at the nuclear envelope in a characteristic rim pattern. Subsequent passage of import substrate from the NPC into the nuclear interior requires the addition of two other import factors: p10/NTF2 (9Moore M.S. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10212-10216Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 10Paschal B.M. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) and the small GTPase Ran (11Moore M.S. Blobel G. Nature. 1993; 365: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 12Melchior F. Paschal B. Evans J. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1649-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The exact role of the nuclear import factor p10, which preferentially binds GDP-Ran rather than GTP-Ran, has yet to be defined. Ran, however, has been shown to be a key player not only for the nuclear import of a variety of substrates bearing different types of NLSs, but also for the nuclear export of most RNAs and a number of proteins containing different types of nuclear export signals (13Ren M. Villamarin A. Shih A. Coutavas E. Moore M.S. LoCurcio M. Clarke V. Oppenheim J. Dı́Eustachio P. Rush M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2117-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar,14Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). Two additional proteins, which are among those retained in large amounts in permeabilized cells, are considered vital to regulation of nuclear import. RCC1, the Ran guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), contains a basic NLS and is localized primarily inside the nucleus bound to chromatin (15Seino H. Hisamoto N. Uzawa S. Sekiguchi T. Nishimoto T. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 393-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Nature. 1991; 354: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). In contrast, the majority of RanGAP1, the Ran GTPase-activating protein (GAP), is found both free in the cytoplasm and bound on the cytoplasmic filaments of the NPC (17Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar, 18Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F.

A. 1994; 91: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The differential localization of these two proteins is predicted to play a role in controlling the direction of nuclear transport by controlling the assembly and disassembly of transport complexes in response to the relative predicted concentrations of GDP-Ran (predominantly cytoplasmic) and GTP-Ran (predominantly nuclear) (20Izaurralde E. Kutay U. von Kobbe C. Mattaj I.W. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6535-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Significantly, the addition of GTP-Ran (instead of GDP-Ran) to the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear envelope is known to inhibit nuclear import, probably due to the ability of GTP-Ran (but not GDP-Ran) to disrupt the karyopherin α-β1 complex and to release karyopherin β1 from docking sites on the NPC (21Görlich D. Panté N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 22Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Other proteins, for example RanBP1 and components of the NPC, are thought to play a critical role in nuclear import, but do not have to be added to permeabilized cells to achieve efficient import (see below). The role of nucleotide hydrolysis in nuclear transport is unknown. It has been reported recently that certain types of Ran-dependent nuclear export require the presence of GTP Ran (based on microinjection) but do not appear to require GTP hydrolysis by Ran (23Richards S.A. Carey K.L. Macara I.G. Science. 1997; 286: 1842-1844Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to studies of nuclear import, in which there have been a number of reports, using both hydrolysis-resistant GTP analogs and Ran mutants incapable of GTP hydrolysis (for example, Q69L Ran) (19Bischoff F.R. Klebe C. Kretschmer J. Wittinghofer A. Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), that GTP hydrolysis by Ran is required for import (11Moore M.S. Blobel G. Nature. 1993; 365: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 12Melchior F. Paschal B. Evans J. Gerace L. J.

To understand the role of GTP hydrolysis by Ran in nuclear import, we attempted to identify the critical step(s) that required GTP hydrolysis. We verified that hydrolysis-resistant GTP analogs or Q69L Ran inhibited nuclear import in the presence of cytosol as observed previously. However, we found that GTP hydrolysis was not necessary in assays employing purified recombinant factors instead of cytosol. We found that nuclear import could occur in the presence of both poorly hydrolyzable GTP analogs and Q69L Ran. We hypothesize that earlier results were due to the presence of RCC1 outside of the nucleus during import assays, resulting in the inappropriate generation of GTP Ran in the cytoplasm. Accordingly, we confirmed the existence of RCC1 in cytosolic extracts utilized in many earlier studies. Furthermore, we demonstrate that an apparent hydrolysis requirement can be introduced into recombinant import assays by the addition of recombinant RCC1. The hSRP1ah expression vector was obtained from A. Lamond and the human karyopherin β expression vector was obtained from D. Görlich. Human Ran and Q69L Ran expression plasmids were obtained from M. Rush and E. Fanning, respectively. The human RCC1 expression vector was from T. Nishimoto. The human p10 was produced from anEscherichia coli expression vector obtained from U. Grundmann. When possible, nucleotides were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Xanthosine 5′-triphosphate was purchased from Sigma. All recombinant proteins were snap-frozen in the indicated buffer in single use aliquots and stored at −80 °C. The human recombinant karyopherin α2 was expressed in bacteria, purified as described, (5Weis K. Mattaj I.W. Lamond A.I. Scienc e. 1995; 268: 1049-1053Google Scholar) and dialyzed against Buffer A (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.3, 100 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm DTT). The human karyopherin β1 expression vector was obtained from D. Gàrlich and the protein was purified according to his suggested method (26Görlich D. Vogel F. Mills A.D. Hartmann E. Laskey R.A.

The cells were French-pressed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 15 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the lysate was centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 90 min. Karyopherin β was purified by passage of the supernatant over a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated in the same buffer followed by elution with a 200–800 mm NaCl gradient, then fractionated on a Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration column equilibrated in transport buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.3, 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT). Ran (13Ren M. Villamarin A. Shih A. Coutavas E. Moore M.S. LoCurcio M. Clarke V. Oppenheim J. Dı́Eustachio P. Rush M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2117-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and Q69L Ran (19Bischoff F.R. Klebe C. Kretschmer J. Wittinghofer A. Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) were purified identically. Transformed BL21 (DE3) cells were induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h at 25 °C and then French-pressed in homogenization buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.3, 80 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm DTT) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 100 μmGDP. After centrifugation as above, Ran was isolated from the supernatant by a 35–55% ammonium sulfate precipitation. The pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer containing 250 μm GDP, and Ran was isolated by gel filtration chromatography on a Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration column equilibrated in homogenization buffer. Fractions containing Ran were diluted with an equal volume of 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.3, 2 mmmagnesium acetate, 1 mm DTT and were loaded onto a heparin-Sepharose column equilibrated in the same buffer containing 40 mm potassium acetate and eluted with the same buffer containing 0.5 m potassium acetate. Ran-containing fractions were dialyzed against Buffer A containing 2 mmmagnesium acetate. The human recombinant p10 (27Lehmeier B. Amann E. J. Biotechnol. 1992; 23: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) was expressed in BL21(DE3) cells, which were grown to an A 595 of 0.6–0.8 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3–4 h at 37 °C. The cells were disrupted by French-pressing in 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.3, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and centrifuged as above. The supernatant was diluted 1:5 with 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.3, 2 mm DTT, applied to a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated in the same buffer plus 10 mm NaCl, and eluted in a 0–300 mm NaCl gradient. p10-containing fractions were subjected to 50% ammonium sulfate precipitation of the p10-containing fractions. The pellet was resuspended in Buffer B (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.3, 100 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm DTT) and loaded on a Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration column equilibrated in the same buffer to further purify the p10. Recombinant human RCC1 was purified as described (28Dasso M. Sedki T. Azuma Y. Ohba T. Nishimoto T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5732-5744Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and dialyzed against Buffer B + 50 mm sucrose. An anti-RCC1 antibody was produced by immunizing rabbits with recombinant RCC1 followed by affinity purification of the serum against the same protein. RCC1 was incubated with 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) for 15 min on ice prior to stopping the reaction by the addition of DTT to 20 mm. For mock-treated samples, the DTT was added to 20 mm final concentration prior to the addition of NEM (10 mm final concentration). The concentration of DTT in the RCC1 samples during NEM treatment was 0.5 mm. NEM stock (0.5 m in Me2SO) was prepared fresh daily. The nuclear import assay was performed essentially as described (29Moore M.S. Blobel G. Cell. 1992; 69: 939-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) using a reporter import construct consisting of rhodamine-labeled BSA coupled to peptides containing the NLS of the SV40 T antigen. Many of these experiments were also repeated using Texas Red-labeled nucleoplasmin as an import substrate with identical results. 2I. Cushman and M. S. Moore, unpublished observations. The import assay was performed in HeLa cells permeabilized with 70 μg/ml digitonin. Except where noted, the standard import reaction contained 5–10 μg/ml tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-NLS-BSA (74–148 nm), 20 μg/ml (0.33 μm) karyopherin α2, 25 μg/ml (0.25 μm) karyopherin β1, 30–50 μg/ml (1.3–2.0 μm) Ran, 3 μg/ml (0.21 μm) p10, 2 mg/ml BSA, and 1 mmfinal concentration of the indicated nucleotide in transport buffer. Where included, the following concentrations were used: RCC1 at 0.1 μg/ml (2 nm); GTP, ATP, GMP-PNP, GDP, GDPβS, or AMP-PNP at 1 mm. All reaction mixtures were preincubated at room temperature for 15 min prior to starting the import assay. The import assay was carried out in the permeabilized cells for 20 min at room temperature prior to washing and fixation. The samples were observed with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu charge-coupled device camera (no. C2400) and intensifier (no. C2400–68), and quantitation of the fluorescent images was performed with Optimas 4.1 imaging and quantitation software, including custom macro software written by Matthew M. Batchelor of Meyer Instruments Inc. (Houston, TX). The mean nuclear fluorescence of 30–50 nuclei per sample was determined essentially as described (29Moore M.S. Blobel G. Cell. 1992; 69: 939-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Samples were photographed at identical exposures on T-MAX 400 film and printed identically except where noted. Xenopus ovarian cytosol was prepared as described (29Moore M.S. Blobel G. Cell. 1992; 69: 939-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Total HeLa lysate was prepared by resuspending washed, pelleted HeLa cells in SDS-polyacrylamde gel electrophoresis sample buffer. HeLa cytosol was prepared as described in Ref. 30Adam S.A. Spector D.L. Goldman R.D. Leinwand L.A. Cells: A Laboratory Manual. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 45.5Google Scholar. 125 μCi (42 pmol) of [α-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) was converted to GDP (31Ferguson K.M. Higashijima T. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7393-7399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a reaction containing 280 mmTris, pH 7.0, 1 mm glucose, 10 mmMgCl2, and 3 μl (6.3 units) of hexokinase (Sigma catalog no. H-5625) and incubated 4 h at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by heating to 65 °C for 3 min. Conversion was verified by thin layer chromatography. 25 μg (1 nmol) of Ran was loaded with 3.2 pmol of 3000 Ci/mmol [α-32P]GDP in Buffer B plus 2 mg/ml BSA and 5 mm EDTA, for 15 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 mmMgCl2 and then passed over a Nap5 column equilibrated with buffer C (Buffer B + 5 mm MgCl2). For each reaction 10 pmol of Ran was incubated in Buffer C with 1 mmcold GTP and the indicated amounts of RCC1 for 15 min at 30 °C. This reaction was stopped by adding 900 μl of cold Buffer C. Samples were immediately run over 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell, catalog no. 20340), washed twice with 4 ml of cold Buffer C, and the filters were placed in scintillation fluid and counted. As expected, purified recombinant transport factors (karyopherins α2 and β1, Ran, and p10) supported nuclear import of NLS-BSA in permeabilized cells in the presence of GTP, but not in the presence of GDP, GDPβS, AMP-PNP, or in the absence of nucleotide (Fig. 1, A andB) (29Moore M.S. Blobel G. Cell. 1992; 69: 939-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). ATP also supported nuclear import (Fig.1 A), as did all other nucleoside triphosphates tested (CTP, UTP, and xanthine 5′-triphosphate; data not shown). The lack of a specific NTP requirement in this assay is probably due to the presence of nucleoside diphosphokinase-like activity, which is retained in permeabilized cells and capable of generating GTP from an added NTP. 3M. S. Moore and E. D. Schwoebel, unpublished observations. Contrary to previous reports, we found that the hydrolysis-resistant GTP analogs GMP-PNP and GTPγS would also stimulate the movement of NLS-BSA into the nucleus, indicating that GTP hydrolysis may, in fact, not be necessary for import of this type of substrate through the NPC and release into the nucleus (Fig. 1, A and B). To verify that nuclear import could occur in the absence of GTP hydrolysis by Ran, a mutant Ran that is unable to hydrolyze GTP (Q69L Ran) (19Bischoff F.R. Klebe C. Kretschmer J. Wittinghofer A. Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) was substituted for the wt Ran in the in vitroassay. Both the Q69L Ran and the wt Ran were exclusively in the GDP-bound form prior to addition to the assay as determined by fast protein liquid chromatography analysis (data not shown). When added with either GDP, GDPβS, or AMP-PNP, Q69L Ran (like wt Ran) was unable to support nuclear import (Fig. 1, A and B). However, when added with either GTP, GMP-PNP, or GTPγS, Q69L Ran was capable of supporting nuclear import (Fig. 1, A andB). These results indicated that free GTP (or its structural equivalent) was required for transport, but that GTP hydrolysis by Ran was not required for passage of import substrate through the NPC and into the nuclear interior. The rates of import supported by Q69L Ran, however, were lower than that supported by wt Ran (Fig. 1 C) (see below). Thus, we observed that import supported by cytosol requires nucleotide hydrolysis (data not shown), while import supported by purified recombinant import factors does not (Fig. 1). Clearly, some component(s) present in cytosol, and not required for import, mediated the observed difference in nucleotide hydrolysis requirements between the two samples. We postulated that RCC1 (the Ran GEF), while predominantly nuclear in vivo, would be present in cytosol (at least in low amounts) and might be responsible for loading Ran with GTP or its structural equivalent (GMP-PNP or GTPγS), thus inhibiting import. Immunoblotting revealed that RCC1 was, in fact, present in two different cytosol preparations commonly used to support nuclear importin vitro (Fig. 2 A,lanes 1 and 3), although, as expected, it was much more abundant in a total cell lysate (Fig. 2 A,lane 2) (11, 12,). We next tested whether the addition of recombinant RCC1 to recombinant import factors could restore the inhibition of nuclear import by hydrolysis-resistant GTP analogs. Since RCC1 itself contains an NLS, it was necessary to inactivate the RCC1 exchange activity such that it would be possible to distinguish inhibition of nuclear import caused by RCC1's GEF activity on Ran from inhibition caused by competition for import between the two NLS-containing proteins (RCC1 and NLS-BSA). RCC1's exchange activity was found to be abolished by treatment with the alkylating agent NEM (Fig. 2 B). RCC1 was then added to import assays to determine whether it would affect apparent hydrolysis requirements in a manner similar to cytosol. NEM-treated (inactivated) RCC1 was added as a control at the same concentration as mock treated (active) RCC1 (0.1 μg/ml, 2.2 nm). The addition of hydrolysis-resistant GTP analogs (GMP-PNP or GTPγS) and mock-treated RCC1 to recombinant import factors inhibited nuclear import, while the addition of NEM-treated RCC1 (which lacked exchange activity) had no effect (Fig. 3 A). Similarly, the addition of active RCC1 to Q69L Ran and GTP also inhibited nuclear import. Quantitation of these samples (Fig. 3 B) clearly demonstrated the inhibition of import mediated by addition of active RCC1. Thus, a requirement for GTP hydrolysis by Ran during this type of nuclear import was not observed unless active RCC1 was added to the cytosolic side of the nuclear envelope. All previous reports of classical NLS-mediated Ran-dependent nuclear import have either demonstrated a GTP hydrolysis requirement or implied an hydrolysis requirement by including a hydrolyzable NTP in the import assay mixture (32Moore M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22857-22860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This is the first report that this type of NLS-mediated import can occur in the absence of NTP hydrolysis in general and GTP hydrolysis by Ran in particular. The decreased level of nuclear import in the presence of hydrolysis-resistant GTP analogs or Q69L Ran as compared with that seen with wt Ran and GTP indicates that GTP hydrolysis by Ran, while not being required for import, may be required for the recycling of some constituent of the transport machinery (see below). We also cannot rule out the possibility that the minor structural differences between Q69L Ran and wt Ran, and between GTPγS, GMP-PNP, and GTP may have also been slowing the rate of nuclear import for reasons unrelated to GTP hydrolysis. Because in the presence of cytosol we observed a requirement for GTP hydrolysis in nuclear import (data not shown), but not when purified transport factors were added (Fig. 1), it was critical to determine which component(s) present in cytosol mediates inhibition of nuclear import by GTP analogs. It has been demonstrated that the addition of GTP Ran to the cytoplasmic side of the NE inhibits nuclear import, probably because GTP Ran disrupts the karyopherin α-β1complex and releases karyopherin β1 from docking sites on the NPC (21Görlich D. Panté N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 22Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Either Q69L Ran (in the GTP-bound form) or wt Ran bound to either GMP-PNP or GTPγS are unable to hydrolyze bound nucleotide in response to RanGAP1 and would thus presumably accumulate upon generation. We hypothesized that the RCC1 present in cytosol could generate sufficient quantities of GAP-unresponsive GTPγS Ran or GMP-PNP Ran on the cytoplasmic side of the NE and thus could be responsible for the import inhibition observed in the presence of cytosol containing hydrolysis-resistant GTP analogs. The similarity in hydrolysis requirements between import supported by purified, recombinant factors plus RCC1 and import supported by cytosol strongly reinforces this conclusion. We also find a correlation between the requirement for GTP hydrolysis and the presence of RCC1 in earlier studies (9Moore M.S. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10212-10216Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 11Moore M.S. Blobel G. Nature. 1993; 365: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Fraction A (29Moore M.S. Blobel G. Cell. 1992; 69: 939-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), which contains import factors partially purified from Xenopus cytosol, also contains RCC1. 4M. S. Moore, unpublished observations. Accordingly, like cytosol, hydrolyzable NTP is required for nuclear import in the presence of Fraction A (9Moore M.S. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10212-10216Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 11Moore M.S. Blobel G. Nature. 1993; 365: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). While the presence of RCC1 would explain the ability of GTP analogs to inhibit import in vitro in the presence of cytosol, in certain previous studies these analogs were also reported to inhibit import in the presence of just recombinant import factors (25Weis K. Dingwall C. Lamond A.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7120-7128Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). It is possible that differences in techniques may result in different amounts of RCC1 on the cytoplasmic side of the NE. The original protocol (1Adam S.A. Sterne Marr R. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar) for import assays started with cells bound to coverslips that were permeabilized, washed, and tested for import. The modified technique in the cited study utilized cells that were permeabilized and assayed in suspension. Differences in handling between the two techniques, in particular the presumed need to wash by centrifugation and resuspension, could be responsible for lysis and release of RCC1 from nuclei. In addition, although not stated in the cited study, many investigators using this modified technique freeze permeabilized cells for future use (3Görlich D. Prehn S. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E. Cell. 1994; 79: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). This could also be expected to increase the release of RCC1 from the nuclei. As shown in these experiments, increases in the extranuclear concentration of RCC1 have profound effects on apparent nucleotide requirements. Notably, when ATP was added instead of GTP, the ability of RCC1 to inhibit import was reduced (Fig. 3 B). Under these conditions we believe that there are three reactions occurring (i) production of GTP from added ATP and endogenous GDP by nucleoside diphosphokinase, (ii) loading of Ran by RCC1 with GDP or GTP, and (iii) hydrolysis of GTP by Ran catalyzed by RanGAP1. Inhibition of nuclear import has been reported upon the addition of Ran in the GTP-bound form on the cytoplasmic side of the NE, but the percentage of the total Ran in the GTP-bound form required to cause this inhibition has not been determined (20Izaurralde E. Kutay U. von Kobbe C. Mattaj I.W. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6535-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 21Görlich D. Panté N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 22Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Presumably, this accumulation of GTP Ran occurs at a slower rate when GTP has to be produced from added ATP as opposed to when 1 mm GTP is added directly to the import mixture, which would mean that more nuclear import can be obtained before the GTP Ran percentage rises to inhibitory levels. Moreover, samples treated with RCC1 and hydrolysis-resistant GTP analogs lacked the typical rim staining pattern seen in samples containing GDP, GDPβS, or AMP-PNP, indicating that the GTP Ran generated under these conditions disrupts the docking of substrate at the cytoplasmic face of the NPC. Our data showing that the addition of RCC1 and hydrolysis-resistant GTP analog (which together would produce GTP Ran) to the cytoplasmic side of the NE abolishes nuclear import is consistent with previous results showing that high levels of GTP Ran on the cytoplasmic side of the NE inhibit nuclear import (20Izaurralde E. Kutay U. von Kobbe C. Mattaj I.W. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6535-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 21Görlich D. Panté N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Because import requires both GDP Ran and free GTP (or its structural equivalent), GTP Ran must be formed at some point during substrate transport through the NPC or release into the nucleoplasm. This has been predicted to occur when an import complex reaches the nuclear interior, where it encounters RCC1-generated GTP Ran, which releases the import substrate from the NPC. Our data also indicate that this release of the NLS substrate does not require hydrolysis, although this experiment does not demonstrate that the NLS substrate has dissociated from all of the components of the import complex. These data would suggest that the Ran-dependent movement of transport complexes through the NPC itself occurs by facilitated diffusion mechanisms rather than by GTP hydrolysis supplying the energy for movement through the NPC or release into the nucleoplasm. Since Ran mutants unable to hydrolyze GTP are lethal in vivo, we believe a requirement for GTP hydrolysis by Ran does exist. In vivo, import factors have to be recycled back to their original location and condition before they can support another round of import, and interruption of the GTPase cycle could prevent proper recycling. For example, GTP hydrolysis by Ran may be required for the separation of karyopherin β from Ran. In the presence of hydrolysis-resistant analog, this complex may move back to the cytoplasmic face of the NPC, but be unable to dissociate in response to GTP hydrolysis stimulated by RanGAP1. However, we have been unable to demonstrate changes in the distribution of known import factors in response to different nucleotide analogs by immunofluorescence microscopy in permeabilized cells. A more detailed biochemical examination of these distributions is in progress. Nuclear import of an NLS-containing substrate requires movement of protein against its concentration gradient. The overall effect of one transport cycle (including recycling of nuclear import factors) is to increase the compartmentalization of the NLS-containing substrate, which must require energy. However, we propose that nucleotide hydrolysis by Ran during the import portion of the cycle is not the source of this energy. Instead, these data indicate that energy may be required either during recycling of import factors or in maintenance of the GDP Ran-GTP Ran gradient. Thus the energy requirements for nuclear transport cannot be fully understood without a more clear understanding of the mechanism of nuclear import. We thank T. Nishimoto, A. Lamond, M. Rush, E.

The microbial degradation of aromatic compounds constitutes an essential link in the global carbon cycle. The aerobic degradation of aromatic compounds such as toluene, naphthalene, and biphenyl generally proceeds via a catecholic catabolite with hydroxyl substituents on two adjacent carbon atoms. This catecholic compound is cleaved by a dioxygenase from one of two very different classes. Intradiol dioxygenases utilize non-heme ferric iron to cleave the aromatic nucleus ortho to (between) the hydroxyl substituents whereas extradiol dioxygenases utilize non-heme ferrous iron to cleave the aromatic nucleus meta (adjacent) to the hydroxyl substituents. The mechanism of intradiol dioxygenases is better understood due to their greater stability, favorable properties for spectroscopic examination, and the accessibility of catalytic intermediates (1Que L.

Interest in extradiol dioxygenases is nonetheless considerable, not only because of their general metabolic significance and catalytic properties, but also because of the potential exploitation of these enzymes in the degradation of environmental pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls. 2,3-Dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenase (DHBD) 1The abbreviations used are: DHBD, 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenase; HEPPS, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid; DHB, 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl. 1The abbreviations used are: DHBD, 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenase; HEPPS, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid; DHB, 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl.is a component of the aerobic biphenyl degradation pathway of a number of microorganisms and cleaves 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl (DHB) in an extradiol fashion as shown in Scheme FS1.

Subsequent O2 binding to the Fe(II) with charge transfer from the bound catecholic monoanion results in the generation of an iron-bound superoxide-like moiety and an iron-bound, activated catechol. It has been proposed that reaction of these two species forms a bridged peroxy intermediate, which undergoes Criegee rearrangement to give an unsaturated lactone intermediate. This lactone is finally hydrolyzed to yield the reaction product. Several steps in this mechanism have yet to be substantiated, and the catalytic roles of conserved active site residues remain to be fully elucidated. With the development of structural data, DHBD has become an attractive system for experiments that will further our understanding of extradiol dioxygenase function. Such studies depend upon the availability of homogeneous, active preparations of the enzyme. The stability of a number of extradiol dioxygenase preparations has been improved through the inclusion of organic additives in solutions of the enzymes. While this strategy has been in use for at least 30 years (12Nozaki M. Kagamiyama H. Hayaishi O. Biochem. Z. 1963; 338: 582-590PubMed Google Scholar), the mechanism of stabilization has yet to be reported. Even with this precaution, the best reported preparations of DHBD contain at most 50% of their complement of active site Fe(II) (13Eltis L.D. Hofmann B. Hecht H.-J. Lünsdorf H. Timmis K.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2727-2732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This variability in preparations of extradiol dioxygenases complicates spectroscopic studies and the determination of steady-state kinetic parameters. For example, thek cat of the xylE-encoded catechol 2,3-dioxygenase of Pseudomonas putida MT-2 has been variously reported as 930 s−1 (100 mmphosphate, pH 7.5, 25 °C; Ref. 14Cerdan P. Rekik M. Harayama S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and 278 s−1 (50 mm phosphate, pH 7.5, 25 °C; Ref. 15Kobayashi T. Ishida T. Horiike K. Takahara Y. Numao N. Nakazawa A. Nakazawa T. Nozaki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 614-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We report improved techniques for purifying and manipulating DHBD ofB. cepacia LB400. Steady-state kinetic studies were conducted to determine the specificity of the enzyme for different aromatic substrates and O2. In addition, the inhibition of the enzyme by different organic solvents was investigated. The results of the specificity and inhibition studies were evaluated in terms of crystallographically determined structures of catechol, 3-methylcatechol, and DHB complexes. DHBD was hyperexpressed inP. putida KT2442 freshly transformed with pLEBD4, a broad host range expression plasmid containing the structural gene encoding the dioxygenase, as described previously (16de Lorenzo V. Eltis L.D. Kessler B. Timmis K.N. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). For DHBD expression, the strain was grown in Luria broth containing a potassium phosphate buffer described for Terrific Broth (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. J. Wiley & Sons Inc., New York1997Google Scholar) and supplemented (10 ml per liter) with an HCl-solubilized solution of minerals containing 14.1 mm MgCl2·6H2O, 2.5 mmCaCO3, 4.27 mmFeSO4·7H2O, 0.625 mmZnSO4·7H2O, 0.625 mmMnSO4·H2O, 0.125 mmCuSO4·5H2O, 0.125 mmCoCl2·5H2O, 0.125 mmH3BO3, 262.5 mm MgSO4, 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.1 mm thiamine. Cultures were grown at 30 °C and 250 rpm. One liter of media in a 2-liter flask was inoculated with 4 ml of an overnight culture. When the O.D. at 600 nm of the culture reached 0.5, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.25 mm and the culture was incubated for an additional 18 h before harvesting. Catechol, 3-methylcatechol, and protocatechuate were purchased from Aldrich (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). DHB and 3-ethylcatechol were a kind gift from Victor Snieckus. For crystallographic experiments, DHB was obtained from Wako. Ferene-S was purchased from ICN Biomedicals Inc. (Aurora, OH). All other chemicals were of analytical grade. The protein was purified following a modified protocol (13Eltis L.D. Hofmann B. Hecht H.-J. Lünsdorf H. Timmis K.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2727-2732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After disruption of the cells, all procedures were performed under an inert atmosphere unless otherwise specified. Chromatography was performed on an ÄKTA Explorer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Baie d'Urfé, P.Q., Canada). This instrument was installed next to a Labmaster Model 100 glovebox (MBraun, Peabody, MA) equipped with 1/16 and 3/8 inch Swagelok feed-throughs as well as a potted RS232 feed-through. In this configuration, anaerobic buffers could be delivered to the ÄKTA Explorer and the column eluate could be directed to a fraction collector in the glovebox. Buffers were made from water purified on a Barnstead NANOpure UV apparatus to a resistivity of greater than 17.5 MΩcm. Buffer A was 10 mmTris, pH 7.5, containing 10% t-butanol, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.25 mm ferrous ammonium sulfate. Buffer B was buffer A containing 1.0 m NaCl. Buffer C was 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 10% t-butanol, 33 mm ammonium sulfate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.25 mm ferrous ammonium sulfate. Buffers were sparged with N2 and equilibrated in the glovebox for at least 24 h prior to the addition of t-butanol, dithiothreitol, and ferrous ammonium sulfate. Cells from 3 liters of culture were harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in 15 ml of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 20% t-butanol, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.1 mg/ml DNase I. The cells were disrupted by two successive passages through a French Press (Spectronic Instruments Inc., Rochester, NY) using an operating pressure of 20,000 p.s.i. The cell debris was removed by ultracentrifugation in gas-tight tubes at 50,000 rpm for 60 min in a T1250 rotor (DuPont Instruments, Wilmington, DE). The clear supernatant fluid was carefully decanted and referred to as the raw extract. The raw extract (approximately 20 ml) was divided into four equal portions, each of which was loaded onto a HR10/10 Mono Q anion exchange column equilibrated with buffer A. The column was operated at a flow rate of 3.0 ml/min. The enzyme activity was eluted with a 66-ml linear gradient of 8–19% buffer B. Fractions of 2.5 ml were collected. Fractions containing activity from the four runs were concentrated to 4 ml with a stirred cell concentrator equipped with a YM10 membrane (Amicon, Oakville, Ontario, Canada) and loaded onto a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 column equilibrated with buffer C. The column was eluted with buffer C at a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min. Fractions (5 ml) exhibiting activities of more than 1500 units/ml were combined, concentrated to 25–35 mg/ml protein, and flash frozen as beads in liquid N2. Purified DHBD was stored in buffer C at −80 °C for several months without significant loss of activity. Exogenous iron was anaerobically removed from small samples of DHBD prior to kinetic experiments by gel filtration chromatography. Typically, 100–200 μl of purified DHBD was thawed in the glovebox and applied to a 0.7 × 5-cm column of Bio-Gel P6 DG (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, Ont., Canada) equilibrated with stabilization buffer lacking bovine serum albumin (see below). The sample of DHBD was further diluted with stabilization buffer as appropriate. The ability of different anaerobic buffers to stabilize the DHB cleaving activity of DHBD was investigated by monitoring the activity of a 25–50 μg/ml solution of the enzyme over 24 h. Parameters that were varied include pH and the concentrations of ferrous ammonium sulfate, dithiothreitol, and bovine serum albumin. Acetone, ethanol, glycerol, isopropyl alcohol, and t-butanol were tested for their ability to stabilize the activity of DHBD. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on a Bio-Rad MiniPROTEAN II apparatus and stained with Coomassie Blue according to established procedures (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. J. Wiley & Sons Inc., New York1997Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar). Iron concentrations were determined colorimetrically using Ferene S (19Haigler B.E. Gibson D.T. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 457-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymatic activity was measured by following the consumption of dioxygen using a Clark-type polarographic O2 electrode (Yellow Springs Instruments Model 5301 (Yellow Springs, OH)). Reactions were performed in a thermojacketted Cameron Instrument Co. model RC1 respiration chamber (Port Aransas, TX) equipped with a Lauda Model RM6 circulating water bath. The electrode signal was amplified using a Cameron Instrument model OM200 O2 meter and recorded on a microcomputer equipped with a PC-LPM-16 multifunction board and Virtual Bench Data Logger (National Instruments, Austin, TX). Data were recorded every 0.1 s. Initial velocities were determined from progress curves by analyzing the data using Microsoft Excel (Redmond, WA). The slope of the progress curve and the correlation coefficient of the slope were calculated for all consecutive 6-s intervals using the full set of 61 data points. The calculated slopes had correlation coefficients of at least 0.998. Reaction buffers containing different concentrations of dissolved O2 were prepared by vigorously bubbling them with humidified mixtures of O2 and N2 gases for at least 15 min prior to the experiment. The equilibrated buffer was transferred to the reaction chamber using a gas-tight syringe and the stopper was inserted into the reaction chamber. During this operation, the reaction chamber was flushed continuously with the humidified gas mixture. Ultra high purity O2 (100% O2 or 10% O2 in N2) and prepurified N2 were mixed in the desired proportions with a stainless steel Concoa Model 561 gas proportioner. This mixture was humidified by bubbling it through a 5 × 10-cm column of water. The concentration of dissolved O2 in the reaction mixture was verified using the O2 electrode. The standard activity assay was performed in a total volume of 1.45 ml of air-saturated 20 mm HEPPS, 80 mm NaCl (I = 0.1 m), pH 8.0, 25.0 ± 0.1 °C containing 80 μm DHB. The reaction was initiated by injecting between 2 and 10 μl of an appropiate dilution of enzyme preparation into the reaction chamber. Buffers were used within 24 h of preparation. Stock solutions were prepared fresh daily and stored under argon on ice. On each day kinetic assays were performed, the zero of the O2 electrode was established by adding an excess of sodium hydrosulfite to the buffer in the reaction chamber. The O2 electrode was calibrated using standard concentrations of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase and protocatechuate (20Whittaker J.W. Orville A.M. Lipscomb J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 188: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) or DHB and an excess of DHBD. The amount of active DHBD in the assay was defined by the iron content of the injected purified enzyme solution. This quantity was used in the calculation of the specificity and catalytic constants. One unit of enzymatic activity was defined as the quantity of enzyme required to consume 1 μmol of O2/min. Specificity, coupling, inactivation and inhibition experiments were carried out in 20 mm HEPPS, 80 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, 25.0 ± 0.1 °C. The coupling of catecholic substrate and O2 consumption was investigated by monitoring the amount of O2 consumed upon the addition of weighed amounts of catecholic substrate to the reaction mixture. An excess of DHBD was used in these experiments, whereas a limiting amount of DHBD was used in experiments designed to determine the partition ratio for a given catecholic substrate. The amount was chosen such that the enzyme was completely inactivated before the catecholic substrate or O2 was completely consumed in the reaction mixture. The partition ratio was calculated from the ratio of the amount of O2 consumed to the amount of active DHBD added to the assay. In specificity experiments with catechol, 3-methylcatechol, 3-ethylcatechol, and DHB, concentrations of the aromatic substrates were varied from 0.2 times the determined K m to the maximum concentration possible without suicide inhibition affecting the initial velocities. Dissolved O2 concentrations were varied from approximately 60 to 1300 μm. Inhibition experiments with t-butanol, isopropyl alcohol, acetone, ethanol, and glycerol were performed in air-saturated buffer (290 μm dissolved O2) using concentrations of the inhibitor up to 3 m unless otherwise noted. In these experiments, the catecholic substrate was used at concentrations below those at which substrate inhibition or suicide inhibition were observed. Catechol 2,3-dioxygenase utilizes a compulsory order ternary complex mechanism in which the binding of catecholic substrate, A, precedes that of dioxygen (9Hori K. Hashimoto T. Nozaki M. J. Biochem. 1973; 74: 375-384PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, DHBD of B. cepacia LB400 is subject to substrate inhibition at high concentrations of catecholic substrate (13Eltis L.D. Hofmann B. Hecht H.-J. Lünsdorf H. Timmis K.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2727-2732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A mechanism accounting for these observations is shown in Scheme FS2 The steady-state rate equation derived from this mechanism using the King-Altman method (21King E.L. Altman C. J. Phys. Chem. 1956; 60: 1375-1378Crossref Scopus (749) Google Scholar) is given in Equation 1. v=V[A][O2]KdAKmO2+KmA[O2]+KmO2[A]+[A][O2]+KmO2[A]2/KiAEquation 1 In Equation 1, K mA represents theK m for the catecholic substrate;K mO2, the K m for O2; K dA, the dissociation constant for the catecholic substrate; andK iA, the inhibition constant for the catecholic substrate. K mA andK mO2 are not classically defined Michaelis constants as the effect of substrate inhibition ([A]2) is to make the rate approach zero at high concentrations of A. However, K mA andK mO2 are derived from the same first-order rate constants as the equivalent steady-state constants for a compulsory order ternary complex mechanism in which substrate inhibition does not occur (e.g. K mO2 = (k -2 +k 3)/k 2). Furthermore,K mA andK mO2 are the ratios betweenk cat and the specificity constantsk A andk O2, respectively (i.e. k A =k cat/K mA andk O2 =k cat/K mO2). For specificity experiments in which the concentrations of substrates A and O2 were varied, the initial velocities were fit to Equation 1 or to the equivalent steady-state rate equation describing a compulsory order ternary complex mechanism without substrate inhibition. For specificity experiments in which the concentration of only one substrate was varied, the initial velocities obtained were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation or to the equivalent equation describing a mechanism in which substrate inhibition occurs (Equation2). v=V[A]KmAapp+[A]+[A]2/KiAappEquation 2 In this equation, KmAappand KiAapp are the apparentK mA andK iA in air-saturated buffer. Steady-state kinetic data obtained from experiments using organic additives as inhibitors, I, were fit to competitive, uncompetitive, and mixed inhibition equations (Equation 3). v=V[A]Kmapp(1+[I]/Kic)+[A](1+[I]/Kiuapp)Equation 3 In Equation 3, K ic represents the competitive inhibition constant and Kiuapp, the apparent uncompetitive inhibition constant. The latter is related to the trueK iu by Equation 4. Kiuapp=Kiu(KmO2+[O2])KmO2Equation 4 Data were fit to steady-state rate equations using the least squares and dynamic weighting options of LEONORA (22Cornish-Bowden A. Analysis of Enzyme Kinetic Data. Oxford University Press, New York1995Google Scholar). All crystals were prepared and mounted under anaerobic conditions within a N2 atmosphere glove box (Innovative Technology, Newburyport, MA) maintained at 2 ppm O2 or less. Crystals of DHBD were grown in the presence oft-butanol and absence of substrates as described previously (3Han S. Eltis L.D. Timmis K.N. Muchmore S.W. Bolin J.T. Science. 1995; 270: 976-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Binary complexes were prepared by incubating crystals in small volumes (about 1 ml) of anaerobic solutions containing the substrate, 22% (w/v) PEG-4000, 15% (v/v) t-butanol, and 100 mm HEPES buffer at pH 7.5; for some experiments, 1 mmFe(II)(NH4)2(SO4)2 and 0.5 mm Na2S2O4 were also present. For catechol, 3-methylcatechol, and DHB, the concentrations used were 16, 10, and 1 mm, respectively. Crystals were incubated for 12–24 h and mounted in quartz capillaries sealed with epoxy cement. By these procedures, the enzyme was maintained in the active, ferrous form. Diffraction patterns were measured at room temperature (∼20 °C) by the rotation method with the use of an RAXIS IIc imaging plate diffractometer. X-rays were provided by a Rigaku RU200 x-ray generator equipped with a copper anode and focusing mirror optics (Molecular Structure Corp.) and operated at 50 kV and 80–100 mA. The rotation angle and exposure time per image were typically 1° and 10 min, and the crystal-to-detector distance was 110 mm. The diffraction data were analyzed with the HKL package (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38440) Google Scholar). The CCP4 package (24Collaborative Computing Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19728) Google Scholar) was used for general crystallographic calculations, whereas the XPLOR system (25Brünger A.T. X-PLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) was used for restrained (26Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 24-36Crossref Scopus (2539) Google Scholar) crystallographic refinement. Electron density analysis and model building were accomplished with the program O (27Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). Refinement of the 3-methylcatechol complex was initiated with a model derived from the refined structure of the substrate-free protein (3Han S. Eltis L.D. Timmis K.N. Muchmore S.W. Bolin J.T. Science. 1995; 270: 976-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) by deleting the active site iron atom and its two water ligands as well as one additional water and a t-butanol molecule located within 6 Å of the iron. Following one cycle of XPLOR refinement (coordinates and individual B factors), F o −F c and 2F o −F c maps were analyzed, and the active site iron was added to the model. Protein-associated solvent atoms with Bfactors larger than 60 Å2 were deleted, and a single solvent atom was added to account for a strong, positive feature ∼9 Å from the iron. Following a second cycle of XPLOR refinement and map evaluation, 3-methylcatechol and two waters adjacent to the iron atom were added, and the previously added solvent atom was replaced with at-butanol molecule. Four additional rounds of computational refinement and model building completed the refinement. Whenever the active site iron atom was included in the model, the iron-ligand bond distances were restrained to a target value of 2.2 Å with a weak force constant of 10 kcal·mol−1·Å−2. During the refinement, residual positive difference peaks in the vicinity of the active site were recognized as features representing the active site structure of the substrate-free state. That is, it was apparent that the crystal contained active sites in two states: the substrate-free form and the ES complex. The structure at the active site was therefore modeled by two sets of atoms at partial occupancy (50% each). Refinement of the enzyme-catechol complex followed a similar course and required similar modeling of the active site. The refinement of the enzyme-DHB complex is described elsewhere. 2S. Han, L. D. Eltis, and J. T. Bolin, manuscript in preparation. The procedures were similar, but the substrate-binding site was fully occupied by DHB so that the use of two models of the active site was not necessary. Relevant details of the purification are shown in Table I. The enzyme was estimated to be greater than 99% pure as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Blue staining (results not shown). This is comparable to the purity obtained previously (13Eltis L.D. Hofmann B. Hecht H.-J. Lünsdorf H. Timmis K.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2727-2732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anaerobically purified DHBD had a specific activity of 430 units/mg, which was over twice that reported previously (13Eltis L.D. Hofmann B. Hecht H.-J. Lünsdorf H. Timmis K.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2727-2732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Table IPurification details of DHBD from B. cepacia LB400Purification stepTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityYieldmgunitsunits/mg%Raw extract1,150116,900101100MonoQ12552,80042245S2009039,00043133Activity units are defined under “Materials and Methods.” Open table in a new tab Activity units are defined under “Materials and Methods.” The activity of a 25–50 μg/ml solution of DHBD was stabilized by the presence of dithiothreitol and bovine serum albumin, but not ferrous ammonium sulfate. The activity was most stable at pH 8.0; deviations of 0.25 pH units decreased this stability. In the presence of 1m t-butanol or isopropyl alcohol, approximately 24% of the activity remained after 24 h, as compared with 19% in the presence of 1 m ethanol or glycerol and 13% in the absence of organic compounds (see data on inhibition below). For steady-state kinetic assays, DHBD was diluted in 20 mm HEPPS, 80 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, 10%t-butanol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and stored on ice under an inert atmosphere. Under these conditions, more than 90% of the initial activity of the diluted preparation remained after 6 h. The coupling of catecholic substrate and O2 utilization by DHBD was investigated in 20 mm HEPPS, 80 mmNaCl, pH 8.0 (25 °C), using an O2 electrode that had been calibrated with protocatechuate and protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (20Whittaker J.W. Orville A.M. Lipscomb J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 188: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Within experimental error, the amount of O2 consumed corresponded to the amount of catechol or DHB added to the reaction mixture (results not shown). It was concluded th"

We report that the 72-kDa signal recognition particle (SRP) protein, a rare target of autoantibodies found in the serum of patients with dermatomyositis and systemic lupus erythematosus, is rapidly cleaved in Jurkat T cells treated with apoptotic (i.e. Fas ligation, treatment with γ or ultraviolet radiation, or co-culture with anisomycin or staurosporine) but not proliferative (CD3 cross-linking) stimuli. Cleavage of SRP 72 produces a 66-kDa amino-terminal fragment and a 6-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment that is selectively phosphorylated on serine residues. Cleavage of SRP 72 is prevented by chemical and peptide caspase inhibitors, and by overexpression of bcl-2, an inhibitor of apoptotic cell death. Analysis of the carboxyl terminus of SRP 72 has identified a putative cleavage site (SELD/A) for group III caspases, and carboxyl-terminal serine residues that are highly conserved in phylogeny. Both serine phosphorylation and caspase cleavage of SRP 72 are observed in cells derived from human, dog, rat, and mouse. Canine SRP 72 is cleaved in vitro by recombinant caspase 3 but retains the ability to mediate transport of a signal peptide-containing protein into the endoplasmic reticulum lumen.

In addition, phosphorylated serine/arginine splicing factors have recently been shown to specifically associate with the U1-small nuclear RNP autoantigen complex during apoptosis (11Utz P.J.

These observations have led to the hypothesis that proteins modified during apoptosis can be presented to the immune system in a way that bypasses tolerance to self proteins. Although the molecular mechanisms by which this occurs are not known, the data suggests that patient-derived autoantisera may be useful in the identification of proteins that contribute to the execution phase of apoptosis.While screening a panel of human autoantisera for their ability to precipitate new phosphoproteins from apoptotic Jurkat cell lysates, we serendipitously identified several sera that precipitated phosphoproteins from extracts prepared from untreated Jurkat cells that were no longer observed when extracts were prepared from apoptotic Jurkat cells. One of these phosphorylated autoantigens has been identified as the 72-kDa component of the signal recognition particle (SRP). 1The abbreviations used are: SRP, signal recognition particle; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HI-FCS, heat-inactivated fetal calf serum; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SAP, shrimp alkaline phosphatase. 1The abbreviations used are: SRP, signal recognition particle; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HI-FCS, heat-inactivated fetal calf serum; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SAP, shrimp alkaline phosphatase.SRP is a ribonucleoprotein complex comprising the 7 S RNA in association with six distinct polypeptides. SRP functions to recognize the signal peptide of nascent transcripts, attach the translating ribosome to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and facilitate translocation into the ER lumen. The 72-kDa SRP protein is essential for protein translocation. In this report we demonstrate that SRP 72 is constitutively phosphorylated on serine residues. In Jurkat cells subject to apoptotic stimuli, SRP 72 is cleaved by caspases to liberate a 6-kDa carboxyl-terminal phosphopeptide. Our results suggest that phosphorylation and caspase cleavage might regulate translocation of secretory proteins into the ER lumen during apoptosis.DISCUSSIONSRP, a highly conserved cytoplasmic complex composed of a 7 S structural RNA molecule and 6 polypeptides, mediates the targeting of secretory proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (26Walter P. Blobel G. Nature. 1982; 299: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 27Walter P. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7112-7116Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The intact particle has at least three separable activities: (i) binding to newly synthesized proteins bearing signal sequence as they emerge from the ribosome; (ii) elongation arrest during translation; and (iii) binding to the SRP receptor, leading to release from elongation arrest and translocation of the targeted protein into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Biochemical mutagenesis experiments have implicated individual domains of the SRP complex in each of these three functions (28Siegel V. Walter P. Cell. 1988; 52: 39-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 29Walter P. Blobel G. Cell. 1983; 34: 525-533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Thus, the 54-kDa polypeptide is required for binding to the signal sequence, the 14- and 9-kDa polypeptides are involved in elongation arrest, and the 68- and 72-kDa proteins have been implicated in binding to the SRP receptor and promoting the directional translocation of newly translated proteins bearing a signal sequence into the lumen of the ER (28Siegel V. Walter P. Cell. 1988; 52: 39-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The role played by the 7 S RNA molecule is currently unknown.Deletion analysis of canine SRP 68 and SRP 72 has demonstrated that these proteins associate with each other through their carboxyl termini, forming a stable complex with the 7 S RNA (14Lütcke H. Prehn S. Ashford A. Remus M. Rainer F. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 977-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A 57-kDa fragment that includes the amino terminus of canine SRP 72 (i.e. a smaller fragment than that generated by caspase cleavage of SRP 72) generated by elastase digestion is still capable of interacting in vitro with SRP 68, while a 42-kDa fragment is not (14Lütcke H. Prehn S. Ashford A. Remus M. Rainer F. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 977-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Interestingly, an elastase-generated carboxyl fragment of ∼4 kDa was observed in this analysis, suggesting that a portion of the carboxyl terminus of SRP 72 is exposed when associated with other components of the SRP particle (14Lütcke H. Prehn S. Ashford A. Remus M. Rainer F. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 977-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with those of Lütcke et al. (14Lütcke H. Prehn S. Ashford A. Remus M. Rainer F. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 977-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) since caspase-cleaved SRP 72 remains associated with the SRP complex in immunoprecipitates (Fig.1 B), and migrates at ∼11 S by sucrose gradient centrifugation when comparing complexes prepared from untreated and apoptotic Jurkat cells (data not shown). SRP has been observed to migrate in a larger complex of ∼40 S (14Lütcke H. Prehn S. Ashford A. Remus M. Rainer F. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 977-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and it remains possible that cleavage of SRP 72 may disrupt the formation of the larger complex.Based on biological and chemical mutagenesis experiments (14Lütcke H. Prehn S. Ashford A. Remus M. Rainer F. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 977-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 28Siegel V. Walter P. Cell. 1988; 52: 39-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), we predict that cleavage of SRP 72 during apoptosis may inhibit binding of the complex to the SRP receptor on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. This would result in (i) globally preventing the localization of secretory proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum; and (ii) irreversible elongation arrest of newly translated proteins bearing a signal sequence. While this is unlikely to play an important role in the execution phase of most types of cell death, cleavage of SRP 72 may play a critical role when apoptosis is induced by enveloped viruses, since many viral proteins pass through the ER. This would be thwarted if SRP 72 was no longer capable of targeting nascent peptides to its receptor on the outer lumen of the ER. While the in vitroresults shown in Fig. 8 argue against this model, it remains possible that removal of the carboxyl terminus of SRP 72 during apoptosis may have a more subtle effect on ER transport in vivo, particularly since the cleaved carboxyl-terminal peptide is likely to harbor the serine phosphorylation site(s).Targeting of secretory proteins to the ER occurs by a strongly conserved, and presumably highly regulated, mechanism. However, little is known about how this process is governed in eukaryotic cells. Protein translation is regulated in response to exogenous stress at an early step (initiation) by several kinases, including: mitogen-activated protein kinases, which repress translation by phosphorylating the mRNA cap-binding protein eIF4E (30Sonenberg N. Gingras A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar); the interferon-inducible, double stranded RNA-regulated protein kinase, which inhibits translation by phosphorylating the eIF2 initiation factor (31de Haro C. Mendez R. Santoyo J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1378-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 32Clemens M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar); the target of rapamycin which phosphorylates PHAS-1, a regulator of eIF4E; and the rapamycin-sensitive p70 S6 kinase, which modulates translation through phosphorylation of the S6 component of ribosomes (33Proud C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 181-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Our observation that SRP 72 is phosphorylated on serine residue(s) in all cell types tested suggests that a serine kinase and/or phosphatase may regulate gene expression at a later step than the translation initiation checkpoint that is regulated by the above kinases.Our results are most consistent with caspase-mediated cleavage of the carboxyl terminus of SRP 72, generating a 6-kDa peptide containing the serine phosphorylation site(s). The fate of the 6-kDa fragment is unknown. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that SRP 72 is a target for both a phosphatase and a caspase during apoptosis. It is also possible that a comigrating serine kinase (e.g. p70 S6 kinase) is coprecipitated with the SRP complex, and that the carboxyl terminus of SRP 72 is required for the interaction between the kinase and SRP. We have not consistently observed a serine kinase activity in these immunoprecipitates in in vitro kinase assays, however, arguing against the later possibility (data not shown).Comparison of the carboxyl terminus of SRP 72 from different organisms (Table I) shows striking conservation of eight serine residues (labeled with an asterisk, *) that are distal to the proposed caspase cleavage site (bold letters). Three of these serine residues are conserved from homo sapiens to Schistosoma mansoni (underlined). Although SRP 72 from Caenorhabditis elegans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacks these conserved serine residues, both proteins have carboxyl-terminal serines (i.e. amino acids 660, 663, and 693, C. elegans; aa 620 and 627, S. cerevisiae) that are potential phosphorylation sites. We have not yet determined whether SRP 72 derived from yeast, C. elegans, and S. mansoniare similarly phosphorylated in vivo.The results shown in Fig. 8 demonstrate cleavage of SRP 72 in vitro by caspase 3; however, the caspase(s) responsible for cleaving SRP 72 in vivo remain unidentified. Based on published data, it is most likely that SRP 72 is cleaved in vivo by a group III caspase such as caspase-6 (Mch 2), caspase-8 (MACH, FLICE, Mch 5), or caspase-9 (ICE-LAP6, Mch 6), reviewed in Ref.21Nicholson D. Thornberry N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2176) Google Scholar. Group III caspases cleave non-DXXD motifs characteristically found in other caspases or in components of the nuclear or cytosolic skeleton (e.g. actin, Gas2, and nuclear lamins (21Nicholson D. Thornberry N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2176) Google Scholar)). The SELD/A motif of SRP 72 most resembles the SELD/A cleavage site of SREBP-2, a transcription factor involved in regulation of cholesterol metabolism that is also associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (34Wang X. Pai J-T. Wiedenfeld E.A. Medina J.C. Slaughter C.A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18044-18050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In support of the hypothesis that SRP 72 is also a substrate for group III caspases, we have observed cleavage of SRP 72 (generated in an in vitro translation reaction) by several group III caspases in vitro, including caspases 8 and 9. 4P. J. Utz, T. M. Le, S. J. Kim, M. E. Geiger, and P. Anderson, unpublished data. It will also be of great interest to determine if SRP 72 from C. elegans and S. cerevisiae (both of which lack a conserved caspase cleavage site), and SRP 72 from S. mansoni (which possesses such a site at665SEWD/A669) can be cleaved in vivoor in vitro.Autoantibodies directed against the 54-kDa polypeptide of SRP were first described independently in 3 patients with dermatomyositis (17Reeves W. Nigam S. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9507-9511Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar,35Okada N. Mimori T. Mukai R. Kashiwagi H. Hardin J. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3219-3223PubMed Google Scholar). It is currently unknown whether phosphorylation or caspase-mediated cleavage of SRP 72 contributes to the production of autoantibodies reactive with components of the SRP complex. Several studies have identified autoantigens as constituents of membrane-bound blebs on the surface of apoptotic cells, where it has been proposed that they are ideally situated for presentation to the immune system (1Utz P.J. Anderson P. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 1152-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 36Casciola-Rosen L.A. Anhalt G. Rosen A. J. Exp.

Consistent with this hypothesis, we have observed SRP components as prominent constituents of apoptotic blebs by immunofluorescence.4 Like SRP 72, several proteins that are modified by caspases, or become associated with highly phosphorylated proteins during apoptosis are targets for autoantibody production in patients with autoimmune disease. The presence of autoantibodies reactive with components of the SRP is associated with a particularly aggressive form of dermatomyositis (39Targoff I. Johnson A. Miller F. Arthritis Rheum. 1990; 33: 1361-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Whether this is a reflection of increased levels of apoptosis in affected tissues remains to be determined. Proteins modified by the proteases and kinases that are activated during apoptosis are often involved in both the execution phase of cell death and in the development of autoantibodies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and mixed connective tissue disease (reviewed in Ref. 1Utz P.J. Anderson P. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 1152-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). For example, at least 17 proteins that are known to be cleaved by caspases during apoptosis are autoantigens, including the 70-kDa component of the U1-small nuclear ribonuclear protein complex (U1–70 kDa) (2Casciola-Rosen L.A.

Our results suggest that phosphorylation and caspase cleavage might regulate translocation of secretory proteins into the ER lumen during apoptosis. DISCUSSIONSRP, a highly conserved cytoplasmic complex composed of a 7 S structural RNA molecule and 6 polypeptides, mediates the targeting of secretory proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (26Walter P. Blobel G. Nature. 1982; 299: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 27Walter P. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7112-7116Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The intact particle has at least three separable activities: (i) binding to newly synthesized proteins bearing signal sequence as they emerge from the ribosome; (ii) elongation arrest during translation; and (iii) binding to the SRP receptor, leading to release from elongation arrest and translocation of the targeted protein into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Biochemical mutagenesis experiments have implicated individual domains of the SRP complex in each of these three functions (28Siegel V. Walter P.

Thus, the 54-kDa polypeptide is required for binding to the signal sequence, the 14- and 9-kDa polypeptides are involved in elongation arrest, and the 68- and 72-kDa proteins have been implicated in binding to the SRP receptor and promoting the directional translocation of newly translated proteins bearing a signal sequence into the lumen of the ER (28Siegel V. Walter P. Cell. 1988; 52: 39-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The role played by the 7 S RNA molecule is currently unknown.Deletion analysis of canine SRP 68 and SRP 72 has demonstrated that these proteins associate with each other through their carboxyl termini, forming a stable complex with the 7 S RNA (14Lütcke H. Prehn S. Ashford A. Remus M. Rainer F. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 977-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A 57-kDa fragment that includes the amino terminus of canine SRP 72 (i.e. a smaller fragment than that generated by caspase cleavage of SRP 72) generated by elastase digestion is still capable of interacting in vitro with SRP 68, while a 42-kDa fragment is not (14Lütcke H. Prehn S. Ashford A. Remus M. Rainer F. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 977-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Interestingly, an elastase-generated carboxyl fragment of ∼4 kDa was observed in this analysis, suggesting that a portion of the carboxyl terminus of SRP 72 is exposed when associated with other components of the SRP particle (14Lütcke H.

(14Lütcke H. Prehn S. Ashford A. Remus M. Rainer F. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 977-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) since caspase-cleaved SRP 72 remains associated with the SRP complex in immunoprecipitates (Fig.1 B), and migrates at ∼11 S by sucrose gradient centrifugation when comparing complexes prepared from untreated and apoptotic Jurkat cells (data not shown). SRP has been observed to migrate in a larger complex of ∼40 S (14Lütcke H. Prehn S. Ashford A. Remus M. Rainer F. Dobberstein B. J.

Cell. 1988; 52: 39-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), we predict that cleavage of SRP 72 during apoptosis may inhibit binding of the complex to the SRP receptor on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. This would result in (i) globally preventing the localization of secretory proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum; and (ii) irreversible elongation arrest of newly translated proteins bearing a signal sequence. While this is unlikely to play an important role in the execution phase of most types of cell death, cleavage of SRP 72 may play a critical role when apoptosis is induced by enveloped viruses, since many viral proteins pass through the ER. This would be thwarted if SRP 72 was no longer capable of targeting nascent peptides to its receptor on the outer lumen of the ER. While the in vitroresults shown in Fig. 8 argue against this model, it remains possible that removal of the carboxyl terminus of SRP 72 during apoptosis may have a more subtle effect on ER transport in vivo, particularly since the cleaved carboxyl-terminal peptide is likely to harbor the serine phosphorylation site(s).Targeting of secretory proteins to the ER occurs by a strongly conserved, and presumably highly regulated, mechanism.

It is also possible that a comigrating serine kinase (e.g. p70 S6 kinase) is coprecipitated with the SRP complex, and that the carboxyl terminus of SRP 72 is required for the interaction between the kinase and SRP. We have not consistently observed a serine kinase activity in these immunoprecipitates in in vitro kinase assays, however, arguing against the later possibility (data not shown).Comparison of the carboxyl terminus of SRP 72 from different organisms (Table I) shows striking conservation of eight serine residues (labeled with an asterisk, *) that are distal to the proposed caspase cleavage site (bold letters). Three of these serine residues are conserved from homo sapiens to Schistosoma mansoni (underlined). Although SRP 72 from Caenorhabditis elegans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacks these conserved serine residues, both proteins have carboxyl-terminal serines (i.e. amino acids 660, 663, and 693, C. elegans; aa 620 and 627, S. cerevisiae) that are potential phosphorylation sites. We have not yet determined whether SRP 72 derived from yeast, C. elegans, and S. mansoniare similarly phosphorylated in vivo.The results shown in Fig. 8 demonstrate cleavage of SRP 72 in vitro by caspase 3; however, the caspase(s) responsible for cleaving SRP 72 in vivo remain unidentified. Based on published data, it is most likely that SRP 72 is cleaved in vivo by a group III caspase such as caspase-6 (Mch 2), caspase-8 (MACH, FLICE, Mch 5), or caspase-9 (ICE-LAP6, Mch 6), reviewed in Ref.21Nicholson D. Thornberry N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2176) Google Scholar. Group III caspases cleave non-DXXD motifs characteristically found in other caspases or in components of the nuclear or cytosolic skeleton (e.g. actin, Gas2, and nuclear lamins (21Nicholson D.

The SELD/A motif of SRP 72 most resembles the SELD/A cleavage site of SREBP-2, a transcription factor involved in regulation of cholesterol metabolism that is also associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (34Wang X.

In support of the hypothesis that SRP 72 is also a substrate for group III caspases, we have observed cleavage of SRP 72 (generated in an in vitro translation reaction) by several group III caspases in vitro, including caspases 8 and 9. 4P. J. Utz, T. M. Le, S. J. Kim, M. E. Geiger, and P. Anderson, unpublished data. It will also be of great interest to determine if SRP 72 from C. elegans and S. cerevisiae (both of which lack a conserved caspase cleavage site), and SRP 72 from S. mansoni (which possesses such a site at665SEWD/A669) can be cleaved in vivoor in vitro.Autoantibodies directed against the 54-kDa polypeptide of SRP were first described independently in 3 patients with dermatomyositis (17Reeves W. Nigam S. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9507-9511Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar,35Okada N. Mimori T. Mukai R. Kashiwagi H. Hardin J. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3219-3223PubMed Google Scholar). It is currently unknown whether phosphorylation or caspase-mediated cleavage of SRP 72 contributes to the production of autoantibodies reactive with components of the SRP complex. Several studies have identified autoantigens as constituents of membrane-bound blebs on the surface of apoptotic cells, where it has been proposed that they are ideally situated for presentation to the immune system (1Utz P.J. Anderson P. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 1152-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 36Casciola-Rosen L.A. Anhalt G. Rosen A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1317-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1527) Google Scholar, 37LeFeber W.P. Norris D.A. Ryan S.R. Huff J.C. Lee L.A. Kubo M. Boyce S.T. Kotzin B.L. Weston W.L. J. Clin.

Consistent with this hypothesis, we have observed SRP components as prominent constituents of apoptotic blebs by immunofluorescence.4 Like SRP 72, several proteins that are modified by caspases, or become associated with highly phosphorylated proteins during apoptosis are targets for autoantibody production in patients with autoimmune disease. The presence of autoantibodies reactive with components of the SRP is associated with a particularly aggressive form of dermatomyositis (39Targoff I. Johnson A. Miller F. Arthritis Rheum. 1990; 33: 1361-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Whether this is a reflection of increased levels of apoptosis in affected tissues remains to be determined. SRP, a highly conserved cytoplasmic complex composed of a 7 S structural RNA molecule and 6 polypeptides, mediates the targeting of secretory proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (26Walter P. Blobel G. Nature. 1982; 299: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 27Walter P. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7112-7116Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The intact particle has at least three separable activities: (i) binding to newly synthesized proteins bearing signal sequence as they emerge from the ribosome; (ii) elongation arrest during translation; and (iii) binding to the SRP receptor, leading to release from elongation arrest and translocation of the targeted protein into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Biochemical mutagenesis experiments have implicated individual domains of the SRP complex in each of these three functions (28Siegel V. Walter P. Cell. 1988; 52: 39-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 29Walter P. Blobel G. Cell. 1983; 34: 525-533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Thus, the 54-kDa polypeptide is required for binding to the signal sequence, the 14- and 9-kDa polypeptides are involved in elongation arrest, and the 68- and 72-kDa proteins have been implicated in binding to the SRP receptor and promoting the directional translocation of newly translated proteins bearing a signal sequence into the lumen of the ER (28Siegel V. Walter P. Cell. 1988; 52: 39-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The role played by the 7 S RNA molecule is currently unknown. Deletion analysis of canine SRP 68 and SRP 72 has demonstrated that these proteins associate with each other through their carboxyl termini, forming a stable complex with the 7 S RNA (14Lütcke H. Prehn S. Ashford A. Remus M. Rainer F. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 977-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A 57-kDa fragment that includes the amino terminus of canine SRP 72 (i.e. a smaller fragment than that generated by caspase cleavage of SRP 72) generated by elastase digestion is still capable of interacting in vitro with SRP 68, while a 42-kDa fragment is not (14Lütcke H. Prehn S. Ashford A. Remus M. Rainer F. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 977-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Interestingly, an elastase-generated carboxyl fragment of ∼4 kDa was observed in this analysis, suggesting that a portion of the carboxyl terminus of SRP 72 is exposed when associated with other components of the SRP particle (14Lütcke H. Prehn S. Ashford A. Remus M. Rainer F. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 977-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with those of Lütcke et al. (14Lütcke H. Prehn S. Ashford A. Remus M. Rainer F. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 977-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) since caspase-cleaved SRP 72 remains associated with the SRP complex in immunoprecipitates (Fig.1 B), and migrates at ∼11 S by sucrose gradient centrifugation when comparing complexes prepared from untreated and apoptotic Jurkat cells (data not shown). SRP has been observed to migrate in a larger complex of ∼40 S (14Lütcke H. Prehn S. Ashford A. Remus M. Rainer F. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 977-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and it remains possible that cleavage of SRP 72 may disrupt the formation of the larger complex. Based on biological and chemical mutagenesis experiments (14Lütcke H. Prehn S. Ashford A. Remus M. Rainer F. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 977-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 28Siegel V. Walter P. Cell. 1988; 52: 39-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), we predict that cleavage of SRP 72 during apoptosis may inhibit binding of the complex to the SRP receptor on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. This would result in (i) globally preventing the localization of secretory proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum; and (ii) irreversible elongation arrest of newly translated proteins bearing a signal sequence. While this is unlikely to play an important role in the execution phase of most types of cell death, cleavage of SRP 72 may play a critical role when apoptosis is induced by enveloped viruses, since many viral proteins pass through the ER. This would be thwarted if SRP 72 was no longer capable of targeting nascent peptides to its receptor on the outer lumen of the ER. While the in vitroresults shown in Fig. 8 argue against this model, it remains possible that removal of the carboxyl terminus of SRP 72 during apoptosis may have a more subtle effect on ER transport in vivo, particularly since the cleaved carboxyl-terminal peptide is likely to harbor the serine phosphorylation site(s). Targeting of secretory proteins to the ER occurs by a strongly conserved, and presumably highly regulated, mechanism. However, little is known about how this process is governed in eukaryotic cells. Protein translation is regulated in response to exogenous stress at an early step (initiation) by several kinases, including: mitogen-activated protein kinases, which repress translation by phosphorylating the mRNA cap-binding protein eIF4E (30Sonenberg N. Gingras A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar); the interferon-inducible, double stranded RNA-regulated protein kinase, which inhibits translation by phosphorylating the eIF2 initiation factor (31de Haro C. Mendez R. Santoyo J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1378-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 32Clemens M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar); the target of rapamycin which phosphorylates PHAS-1, a regulator of eIF4E; and the rapamycin-sensitive p70 S6 kinase, which modulates translation through phosphorylation of the S6 component of ribosomes (33Proud C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 181-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Our observation that SRP 72 is phosphorylated on serine residue(s) in all cell types tested suggests that a serine kinase and/or phosphatase may regulate gene expression at a later step than the translation initiation checkpoint that is regulated by the above kinases. Our results are most consistent with caspase-mediated cleavage of the carboxyl terminus of SRP 72, generating a 6-kDa peptide containing the serine phosphorylation site(s). The fate of the 6-kDa fragment is unknown. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that SRP 72 is a target for both a phosphatase and a caspase during apoptosis. It is also possible that a comigrating serine kinase (e.g. p70 S6 kinase) is coprecipitated with the SRP complex, and that the carboxyl terminus of SRP 72 is required for the interaction between the kinase and SRP. We have not consistently observed a serine kinase activity in these immunoprecipitates in in vitro kinase assays, however, arguing against the later possibility (data not shown). Comparison of the carboxyl terminus of SRP 72 from different organisms (Table I) shows striking conservation of eight serine residues (labeled with an asterisk, *) that are distal to the proposed caspase cleavage site (bold letters). Three of these serine residues are conserved from homo sapiens to Schistosoma mansoni (underlined). Although SRP 72 from Caenorhabditis elegans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacks these conserved serine residues, both proteins have carboxyl-terminal serines (i.e. amino acids 660, 663, and 693, C. elegans; aa 620 and 627, S. cerevisiae) that are potential phosphorylation sites. We have not yet determined whether SRP 72 derived from yeast, C. elegans, and S. mansoniare similarly phosphorylated in vivo. The results shown in Fig. 8 demonstrate cleavage of SRP 72 in vitro by caspase 3; however, the caspase(s) responsible for cleaving SRP 72 in vivo remain unidentified. Based on published data, it is most likely that SRP 72 is cleaved in vivo by a group III caspase such as caspase-6 (Mch 2), caspase-8 (MACH, FLICE, Mch 5), or caspase-9 (ICE-LAP6, Mch 6), reviewed in Ref.21Nicholson D. Thornberry N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2176) Google Scholar. Group III caspases cleave non-DXXD motifs characteristically found in other caspases or in components of the nuclear or cytosolic skeleton (e.g. actin, Gas2, and nuclear lamins (21Nicholson D. Thornberry N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2176) Google Scholar)). The SELD/A motif of SRP 72 most resembles the SELD/A cleavage site of SREBP-2, a transcription factor involved in regulation of cholesterol metabolism that is also associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (34Wang X.

https://openalex.org/W1537399302,"Activation of the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) gene is regarded as one of the earliest and most reliable markers of hypertrophy in the ventricular cardiac myocyte. We have examined the role of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinases in the signaling mechanism(s) leading to hypertrophy using human ANP gene promoter activity as a marker. Endothelin (ET), a well known hypertrophic agonist, increased activity of c-Src, c-Yes, and Fyn within minutes and promoted a selective redistribution of each of these kinases within the cell. Overexpression of c-Src effected a significant increase in activity of a cotransfected human ANP promoter-driven chloramphenicol acetyl transferase reporter, while expression of either c-Yes or Fyn was considerably less effective in this regard. ET-dependent stimulation of the human ANP gene promoter was partially inhibited by co-transfection with dominant negative Ras or dominant negative Src or Csk or by treatment with the potent Src family-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP1, suggesting that the Src family kinases are involved in signaling ET-dependent activation of this promoter. Both ET- and Src-dependent activation of the ANP promoter required the presence of a CArG motif in a serum response element-like structure between −422 and −413 but did not appear to require assembly of a ternary complex for full activity. These findings support a role for Src in the activation of ANP gene expression and suggest that this kinase may contribute in an important way to the signaling mechanisms that activate hypertrophy in the cardiac myocyte.

Lewicki J. Gardner D.G. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 529-546Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, the ANP gene is expressed almost exclusively in the cardiac atria, although modest levels of expression are also detected in the cardiac ventricle, hypothalamus, aortic arch, and lung (2Gardner D.G. Deschepper C.F. Ganong W.F. Hane S. Fiddes J. Baxter J.D. Lewicki J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6697-6701Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 3Gardner D.G. Vlasuk G.P.

Ventricular ANP gene expression is elevated during embryonic and early neonatal life but remains low throughout adulthood unless the ventricle is subjected to hemodynamic stress (e.g. volume or pressure overload). In this context, the ventricular myocyte undergoes characteristic biochemical and morphological changes that signal the initiation of hypertrophy. At the level of gene expression, this includes activation of the immediate early genes (proto-oncogenes like c-fos, c-jun, c-myc, and egr-1) followed by reactivation of a fetal gene program (e.g. ANP, β-myosin heavy chain, and α-skeletal actin) and subsequent up-regulation of sarcomeric contractile proteins (e.g. myosin light chain-2 and cardiac actin) (4Chien K.R.

The high degree of fidelity with which ANP gene expression is activated in this process has led to its identification as one of the earliest and most reliable markers of hypertrophy. While noin vitro system has been shown to mimic hypertrophy in vivo with absolute fidelity, the neonatal rat cardiac myocyte responds to a number of mechanical (e.g. passive stretch) (5Sadoshima J.

The latter is of particular interest in that MAP kinase has classically been associated with activation of receptors associated with tyrosine kinase activity. Several recent studies indicate that G protein-coupled receptors employ a very unique mechanism to effect this stimulation. This involves a Gβγ subunit-mediated increase in Src-tyrosine kinase activity, which in turn leads to phosphorylation of the Shc adapter protein, activation of the Shc-Grb2-Sos-Ras pathway, and increased MAP kinase activity (15Luttrell L.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 33592-33597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), which question the dependence of the hypertrophic response on tyrosine kinase activation, suggesting instead that stimulation of MAP kinase by AII is strongly linked to activation of protein kinase C. Thus, at present, there is no consensus as to the role of the tyrosine kinases in the signaling cascades traditionally associated with the development of hypertrophy. Given the controversy surrounding this issue, we have investigated the role of c-Src and Src-related tyrosine kinases in initiating the signaling cascade linking the liganded ET receptor to activation of the ANP gene promoter and, by inference, to the development of hypertrophy in the neonatal cardiac myocyte. We have determined that ET does activate c-Src in the myocyte and that this activation is closely tied to the subsequent activation of ANP gene transcription. The hANPCAT constructs contain the 5′-flanking sequence of the human ANP gene linked to coding sequence for bacterial chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT); the accompanying numerical designation defines the 5′ limit of the included genomic sequence relative to its native transcription start site. The −1150 hANP promoter fragment was cloned into pSVoLCAT vector, as described previously (29LaPointe M.C. Wu J. Greenberg B. Gardner D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9075-9078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Wu J.P. Kovačič-Milivojevic B. Lapointe M.C. Nakamura K. Gardner D.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1311-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). −466 hANPCAT was constructed from −1150 hANPCAT by polymerase chain reaction (Perkin-Elmer) using an upstream sense oligonucleotide (5′-GGTCTAGAATTTGTCTCGGGCTGCTGG-3′), which incorporated anXbaI site at its 5′ terminus and downstream antisense oligonucleotide (5′-CCAGTACTAGACCAGGCTAGAGTGCAGTGGTGC-3′) derived from CAT coding sequence. Mutants in the serum response element (SRE)-like element of the hANP gene were generated using the TransformerTM site-directed mutagenesis kit fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Mutagenic primers for the Ets motif, CArG box, and AP-1 sites were GGCTGCCTGCCATTTCCGTTGCTCCACCCTTAT, TCCTCTCCACCCTTATGGTTAGGCCCTGACAGCTGA, and GGCCCTGACTGAGATCCAAACAAACCAGGGG (reading 5′ to 3′ on the sense strand, and where boldface type represent mutated nucleotides), respectively. The TKCAT hybrid gene, containing 109 base pairs of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) promoter (positions −109 to +47) fused to CAT, has been described previously (31McKnight S.L.K.R. Science. 1982; 217: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). The following restriction enzyme fragments of the hANP gene were subcloned into pTKCAT and tested for regulatory activity:BamHI/PvuII (positions −472/−400),PvuII/KpnI (positions −400/−332),KpnI/PvuII (positions −332/−208), andPvuI/HaeI (positions −208/+16). Wild type −472/−372 TKCAT and its CArG mutant were generated by polymerase chain reaction using wild type −466 hANPCAT and its homologous CArG mutant as templates; an upstream sense oligonucleotide (5′-CTGCAGAAGCTTGGATCCATTTGTCTTCGGGCTGCTGGCT-3′), which incorporatesPstI and HindIII sites at the 5′-end, and a downstream antisense oligonucleotide (5′-GTCGACAAGCTTCCAGCTCCCCTGGTTTGTTTG-3′), which incorporatesSalI and HindIII sites at the 3′-end, were used to amplify the relevant fragments, which were then cloned into theHindIII site of pTKCAT. All mutants and polymerase chain reaction-generated fragments were sequenced. Dominant negative Ras (N17Ras) was provided by W. J. Fantl. pGK Csk was obtained from Dr. Shigeyuki Nada. c-Src and v-Src came from Dr. J. A. Cooper, and the Y529F and K297M mutants of c-Src were from Dr. Tony Hunter. pMIK Neo Yes was from Dr. Marius Sudol, and SRα Fyn and SRα Lck were provided by Dr. Tadashi Yamamoto. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against c-Src (SRC2), c-Yes (c-Yes3) and Fyn (FYN3)-G were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). A monoclonal antibody (clone 28) that specifically recognizes the region adjacent to Tyr530 in the C-terminal regulatory domain of c-Src was generously provided by Dr. Hisaaki Kawakatsu. This region is recognized by the antibody only when Tyr530 is in the unphosphorylated state, i.e. when the kinase is in an activated form (32Kawakatsu H. Sakai T. Takagaki Y. Shinoda Y. Saito M. Owada M.K. Yano J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5680-5685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Clone 28 antibody was raised against the peptide sequence LEDYFTSTPQYQPGENL, which occurs in the C termini of Src, Fyn, and Yes; consequently, the antibody recognizes all three proteins. Src-specific monoclonal antibody (mAB327) was a gift from Dr. Joan Brugge, and monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (clone 4G10) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Monoclonal antibodies that specifically recognize c-Yes (c-Yes3H9) and Fyn (Fyn301) were obtained from WAKO Chemicals USA (Richmond, VA). Anti-α-actinin (sarcomeric) monoclonal antibody (EA-53) was purchased from Sigma. All secondary antibodies used for immunofluorescence were from Jackson Laboratories (West Grove, PA); those used for Western blots were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Streptavidin conjugates were from Vector Laboratories, Inc. (Burlingame, CA). Dynabeads M-280 (sheep anti-rabbit IgG) were from Dynal A.S. (Oslo, Norway). Primary cultures of rat ventricular myocytes from 1-day-old rats were prepared as described (33Kovačič-Milivojevic B. Gardner D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 292-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and plated on 0.1% gelatin-coated plates in DME-H21/10% enriched calf serum (Gemini Bioproducts Inc., Calabasas, CA). After cell attachment (∼18 h), the culture medium was changed to a defined DME-H21/10% serum substitute medium (34Bauer R.F. Arthur L.O. Fine D.L. In Vitro. 1976; 12: 558-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed after 24–48-h incubation in serum substitute medium. For the transient transfections, 10 million cells/group were resuspended in 400 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 0.1% glucose containing 25 μg of reporter plasmid together with varying concentrations of different expression vectors, as described in the figure legends. DNA concentration for all samples was adjusted to 40 μg with inert DNA (pUC 18). Cells were electroporated using the Bio-Rad Gene Pulsar at 280 V/250 microfarads. Independent measurements of transfection efficiency, using pRSV β-galactosidase, typically show less than 15% variation within a given experiment. After transfection, each group was plated onto 6-cm dishes (15 × 104 cells/cm2) in DME-H21/10% EC. After the initial 24 h, medium was changed to DME-H21/10% serum substitute medium. Endothelin (10−7m) was added at different intervals thereafter. The cells were harvested at 66–72 h post-transfection, and the cell lysates were assayed for CAT activity and β-galactosidase activity as described (33Kovačič-Milivojevic B. Gardner D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 292-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from ventricular cardiocytes using the RNeasy kit (QIAGEN, Inc.). 5 μg of ventricular RNA was size-fractionated on 1% agarose containing 2.2 m formaldehyde, transferred by capillary action to GeneScreen Plus hybridization Transfer Membrane (NEN Life Science Products) in 10× standard saline citrate (SSC, 1.5m sodium chloride, and 0.15 m sodium citrate) for 8–16 h and fixed to the membrane by UV irradiation (DNA transfer lamp, Fotodyne Inc., New Berlin, WI). Membranes were then baked at 80 °C for 1 h and probed with a full-length rat ANP cDNA labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the random primer technique. Hybridizations were performed in Rapid-Hyb buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to instructions of the manufacturer. Blots were later stripped and reprobed with radiolabeled glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA to control for differences in loading and transfer of RNA among samples. To quantitate mRNA levels, autoradiograms were scanned by laser densitometry. Incubations with ET were terminated by aspiration of medium and two rapid washes with ice-cold PBS. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C using ice-cold buffers. Cells were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.25 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (35Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5623-5633Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). After brief sonification, lysates were incubated on ice for 15 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (15 min at 1500 rpm). Lysates were precleared by 30-min incubation with 5 μl of agarose conjugated to mouse, goat, and rabbit IgG, followed by 5-min centrifugation at 7000 × g. Equal concentrations of cellular lysates (250 μg) were then incubated with specific antibodies at concentrations of 1–2 μg/250 μg of protein for 60 min at 4 °C. The immune complexes were collected after the addition of 25 μl of Dynabeads and incubation for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellets were washed once with lysis buffer and two times with buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) and subjected to immunoblotting or the in vitro kinase reaction. Lysates, normalized for protein content, or immunoprecipitates were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer, electrophoretically separated on 12% polyacrylamide gel containing 1% SDS, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Filters were blocked in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20)/5% skim milk buffer, except on those occasions when anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were used, when 5% bovine serum albumin was exchanged for skim milk. Following treatment with a blocking kit (Vector Laboratories), as recommended by the manufacturer, filters were immunoblotted with the appropriate antibody in 0.5–1 × TBST buffer for 60 min. Following a 30-min incubation with biotinylated donkey anti-mouse (1:1000) and a 15-min incubation with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:1000), immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). When necessary, membranes were stripped with 2% SDS in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, in the presence of 200 mm β-mercaptoethanol (freshly added) for 60 min at 50–60 °C. Following overnight blocking in TBST/1% skim milk and treatment with a commercial blocking kit (Vector Laboratories), membranes were reblotted with appropriate antibody, and the protocol described above was repeated. To measure c-Src kinase activity, endogenous c-Src was isolated by immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibody mAB327. The immunoprecipitates from ∼500 μg of total ventricular cell protein were washed three times with Src kinase reaction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 125 mmMg(C2H3O2)2, 25 mm MnCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.25 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol), and reactions were carried out using components of a commercially available Src kinase assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). The assay is based on Src-dependent phosphorylation of a substrate peptide (KVEKIGEGTYGVVYK) derived from p34cdc2 (36Cheng H.-C. Nishio H. Hatase O. Ralph S. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9248-9256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the autophosphorylation assays, immunoprecipitates were washed twice with kinase buffer (10 mm MnCl2, 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.4) and incubated with kinase buffer plus 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 1 μm unlabeled ATP for 15 min. Reactions were terminated by boiling in sample buffer. Samples were resuspended in buffer and electrophoresed on 12% polyacrylamide gels containing 1% SDS. Cells were plated on round 12-mm coverslips (Esco, Germany) coated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml) at a density of 104 cells/cm2, treated with ET as described above, and washed with ice-cold PBS three times. For staining of Src, Yes, and Fyn, cells were fixed either in acetone at −20 °C for 5 min or in 3.7% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min and washed three times with PBS. When fixation was performed in paraformaldehyde, cells were permeabilized for 2 min in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS. Fixed/permeabilized cells were then washed in PBS, blocked with blocking kit (Vector Laboratories), and incubated in wet chambers with primary antibody (1:100 dilution in PBS) overnight at 4 °C. Following three successive 10-min washes in PBS, cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with biotinylated donkey anti-rabbit or rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody diluted 1:100 in PBS. Cells were then washed three times in PBS for 10 min and incubated for 15 min at room temperature with a 1:100 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-streptavidin. After sequential PBS washes (three times, 10 min each), the cells were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Controls performed with only secondary antibodies resulted in negligible signals. Conventional epifluorescence microscopy was carried out using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. Photography was performed with Kodak TMAX 400 black and white film. Treatment of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes with 100 nm ET resulted in a time-dependent increment in whole lysate tyrosine kinase activity, assessed by immunoblotting with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) (Fig.1). Accumulation of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins in the lysates was maximal at 1 min and began to fall after 5 min of exposure to the peptide. Phosphotyrosine content of at least 10 cellular proteins, ranging from ∼20 to 110 kDa was increased by treatment with ET. Prolonged exposure of the film revealed fainter signals corresponding to higher molecular mass, phosphotyrosine-containing proteins (∼120–200 kDa) (data not shown). Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitates of Src in these lysates revealed no change in the levels of Src protein following treatment with ET (Fig. 2 A). However, when the same blot was probed with an antibody that selectively recognizes the activated form of Src (clone 28), an ET-dependent increase in signal intensity was detected. Pooled results from three independent experiments indicated a 2.95 ± 1.32-fold induction of activated Src following ET treatment (data not shown). The ET-dependent activation of Src implies stimulation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity associated with this protein. To confirm this, we carried out an autophosphorylation assay (Fig.2 B) as well as a conventional Src kinase assay using a synthetic peptide sequence derived from p34cdc2 (36Cheng H.-C. Nishio H. Hatase O. Ralph S. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9248-9256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as the target substrate (Fig. 2 C). In both cases, ET provoked an almost 7-fold increase in Src kinase activity, which peaked around 1 min and returned to near basal levels after 15 min of incubation. This induction was largely blocked by inclusion of the nonselective tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein during ET stimulation (Fig.2 C). To explore the possibility that other members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases might be stimulated by ET, we examined extracts from ET-treated cells for the presence of activated Fyn and Yes. As shown in Fig. 3, Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitates generated with anti-Fyn or anti-Yes antibodies showed no change in the absolute levels of these two proteins following ET treatment. However, when the same blots were reprobed with antibody that selectively recognizes the activated forms of Yes or Fyn, a time-dependent increase in levels of the individual activated kinases was observed. These increases were present at 30 s and peaked at 2–15 min of ET exposure. Activation of the Src family tyrosine kinases was accompanied by changes in their topographical distribution within the cell. Primary cultures of neonatal rat ventriculocytes were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence with polyclonal antibodies directed against c-Src. In quiescent myocytes, two patterns of c-Src distribution were apparent: a fine punctate staining throughout the cytoplasm and a concentrated staining adjacent to the membrane (Fig.4 A). Treatment of cells with ET for 120 s produced a striking redistribution of c-Src into large nonuniform aggregates in a perinuclear distribution. The ET-induced redistribution was reversible. After exposure to ET for 15 min, the original diffuse pattern of immunostaining returned (data not shown). Staining with a monoclonal antibody (mAB 327) directed against c-Src revealed a similar distribution pattern (data not shown). The levels of Src immunoreactivity detected in mesenchymal cells (i.e. primarily cardiac fibroblasts) present in these cultures were considerably lower than those seen in cardiac myocytes. A similar approach using antibody directed against Fyn (Fig.4 C) demonstrated an ET-dependent redistribution of the kinase from a diffuse punctate pattern to spherical cytoplasmic vesicles clustered in a perinuclear distribution. In the case of Yes (Fig. 4 B), ET promoted a redistribution from the diffuse pattern seen in the quiescent myocyte to a pattern suggesting a linear array of Yes molecules along the myofilaments of the cell, a distribution that may imply an effect on the assembly and/or function of the contractile apparatus. As in the case of c-Src, Fyn and Yes were detectable in quiescent mesenchymal cells but at much lower levels than those seen in myocytes. Given the evidence linking ET, independently, to activation of Src (22Herman W.H. Simonson M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11654-11661Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and myocyte hypertrophy (7Shubeita H.E. McDonough P.M. Harris A.N. Knowlton K.U. Glembotski C.C. Brown J.H. Ch"

In intact etioplasts, the reduction proceeds to chlorophyllide a and zinc pheophorbide a or, if incubated together with phytyldiphosphate, to chlorophyll a and zinc pheophytina, respectively. In lysed etioplasts supplied with NADPH, the reduction stops at the intermediate step of 71-OH-chlorophyll(ide) and Zn-71-OH-pheophorbide or Zn-71-OH-pheophytin. However, the final reduction is achieved when reduced ferredoxin is added to the lysed etioplasts, suggesting that ferredoxin is the natural cofactor for reduction of chlorophyll b to chlorophyll a.

The appearance and disappearance of Chls (their synthesis and degradation), can be detected by remote sensing from satellites (1Gierloff-Emden H.G. Fernerkundungskartographie mit Satelliten-Aufnahmen. Deutike, Vienna, 1989: 1-588Google Scholar, 2Pérez-Ruzafa A. Gilabert J. Bel-Lan A. Moreno V. Gutiérrez J.M. Sci. Mar. 1996; 60 Suppl. 1: 19-27Google Scholar) and are the only biochemical processes on earth that can currently be observed from outer space. The biosynthesis of Chl a, the most widely occurring Chl, is well known and has been treated in several recent reviews (3Reinbothe S. Reinbothe C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 323-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 4Jahn D. Hungerer C. Troup B. Naturwissenschaften. 1996; 83: 389-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Porra R.J. Photochem.

Photochem. Photobiol. B. Biol. 1997; 41: 201-221Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of Chl b, typical in addition to Chl a for green algae, mosses, ferns and seed plants, is not yet known in detail. The only difference in these chlorophyll structures is located at C-7; the substituent is a formyl group in Chl b but a methyl group in Chla (see Fig. 1). The formyl oxygen is derived from molecular oxygen (8Schneegurt M.A. Beale S.I. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11677-11683Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 9Porra R.J. Schäfer W. Cmiel E. Katheder I. Scheer H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It is generally assumed that the early steps of biosynthesis of Chls a and b are identical and that oxygen is introduced during one of the final steps of the Chlb biosynthesis; however, the exact location in the biosynthetic chain where the oxygenation occurs, before or after phytylation, is not precisely known.The reverse reaction, formation of Chl a from Chlb, has been repeatedly discussed as a process involved in reorganization of the photosynthetic apparatus during acclimation to various light environments (10Tanaka A.Y. Tsuji H. Plant Physiol. 1981; 68: 567-570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Tanaka A.Y. Yamamoto Y. Tsuji H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1991; 32: 195-204Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 12Ohtsuka T. Ito H. Tanaka A. Plant. Physiol. 1997; 113: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Acclimation implies redistribution of Chls between the different chlorophyll-protein complexes (12Ohtsuka T. Ito H. Tanaka A. Plant. Physiol. 1997; 113: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 13Argyroudi-Akoyunoglou J.H. Akoyunoglou A. Kalosakas K. Akoyunoglou G. Plant Physiol. 1982; 70: 1242-1248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reduction of Chl b to Chl a must also play a role in the process of Chl degradation, because during the senescence of higher plants, Chl b disappears together with Chla, but the degradation products are entirely derived from Chl a (14Matile P. Kräutler B. Chemie. 1995; 29: 298-306Google Scholar). Further, the key enzyme of Chl degradation, pheophorbide oxygenase, accepts only Pheide a, whereas Pheide b is a competitive inhibitor (15Hörtensteiner S. Vicentini F. Matile P. New Phytol. 1995; 129: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).The Tanaka group detected the in vitro reduction of the formyl group to the methyl group of Chl derivatives when they investigated the esterification of chlorophyllide (Chlide) bwith etioplasts from cucumber and barley (16Ito H. Tanaka Y. Tsuji H. Tanaka A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 17Ito H. Takaichi S. Tsuji H. Tanaka A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1475-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The esterified products were Chl b, Chl a, and in barley the intermediate 71-OH-Chl a (Ref. 18Ito H. Ohtsuka T. Tanaka A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1475-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar; see Fig.1). The yield of products, especially of Chl a, was increased by adding ATP. The reduction of pyro-Chlide b, lacking the methoxycarbonyl substituent at C-132, to pyro-Chl a in greening etioplasts of cucumber extended this finding and showed that reductase activity increased slightly during greening in the light (19Ito H. Tanaka A. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1996; 34: 35-40Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that the same reduction can be performed with zinc rather than magnesium complexes. Thus, the formyl group of zinc pheophorbide (ZnPheide) b can be chemically reduced with cyanoborohydride to a methyl group producing ZnPheide a (20Scheumann V. Helfrich M. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. Z. Naturforsch. Teil C Biochem. Biophys. Biol. Virol. 1996; 51: 185-194Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Zn-71-OH-Pheide a and Zn-71-OCH3-Pheide a are intermediates in this chemical reduction. Earlier, Vezitzkii and Shcherbakov (21Vezitskii A.Y. Shcherbakov R.A. Photosynthetica. 1988; 22: 184-189Google Scholar) infiltrated etiolated rye leaves with Chlideb and ZnPheide b and demonstrated the reduction to Chl a and ZnPhe a, respectively. Likewise, infiltration of ZnPheide b or Zn-71-OH-Pheidea into primary leaves of etiolated oat seedlings yielded ZnPhe a (20Scheumann V. Helfrich M. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. Z. Naturforsch. Teil C Biochem. Biophys. Biol. Virol. 1996; 51: 185-194Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In cooperation with Tanaka′s group, we showed that the first step, reduction of ZnPheide b to Zn-71-OH-Phe(ide) a, proceeds before or after esterification in purified, broken etioplasts of barley (22Scheumann V. Ito H. Tanaka A. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This step required NADPH or NADH but no ATP.In this paper, we describe the second step, the formation of Chla and ZnPhe(ide) a, in more detail; we compare this reduction in both intact and broken etioplasts and describe the effect of ATP. The comparison led to the discovery that the second step of reduction requires reduced ferredoxin.RESULTSAt first, we addressed the question of why only the first step of Chl b reduction to 71-OH-Chl a was catalyzed by purified, lysed etioplasts (22Scheumann V. Ito H. Tanaka A. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) but varying amounts of Chla, the product of the second reduction step, were found if the reaction was carried out with freshly prepared, crude etioplast preparations (17Ito H.

The following two possibilities for this finding were considered. 1) During the lengthy purification procedure, a sensitive compound of the second reductase system could be inactivated by oxidation, but the addition of the antioxidant, dithiothreitol, did not restore this second reductase to form Chl a (data not shown). 2) Crude etioplast preparations always involve partial lysis of etioplasts. The crude etioplast preparation contained intact and lysed etioplasts in variable amounts. For that reason Scheumann et al. (22Scheumann V. Ito H. Tanaka A. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) used purified etioplasts that were lysed osmotically. To test whether intactness of the etioplasts enhanced the second reduction step, we performed the assay with intact etioplasts in isotonic medium.The method of preparation was essentially that of Eichacker et al. (23Eichacker L.A. Edhofer I. Wanner G. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The crude etioplast preparation was further purified by density gradient centrifugation (Fig.2 A). The fraction on top of the 35% Percoll, “lysed etioplasts” (Fig. 2 A) consisted mainly of broken etioplasts. The fraction at the boundary layer 35%/65% Percoll contained intact etioplasts according to Eichackeret al. (23Eichacker L.A. Edhofer I. Wanner G. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We confirmed the intactness by the presence of stromal proteins in this fraction, e.g. the large subunit of ribulose 1,5-diphosphate carboxylase (LSU, Fig.2 B, lane 4) and ferredoxin (see Fig.4 A). Stromal proteins were absent in the fraction of lysed etioplasts as expected (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). Membrane fractions of both intact and lysed etioplasts contain the NADPH-protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR) as the main protein band (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2 and 5).Figure 2Demonstration of the intactness of the purified etioplasts. Etioplasts were isolated from primary leaves of barley as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After centrifugation, lysed etioplasts (m) and intact etioplasts (e) were removed from the Percoll gradient (A), washed with isotonic buffer, and lysed osmotically and by freezing and thawing. Both fractions were adjusted to equal protochlorophyllide concentrations. After centrifugation, the supernatants of mand e were removed, and the membranes were washed twice and collected by centrifugation. The proteins were separated on a 17% polyacrylamide gel and silver-stained (B). The lanes correspond to the following fractions: molecular marker (lane 1), membranes of m(lane 2), supernatant of m(lane 3), supernatant of e (lane 4), membranes of e (lane 5). The main protein bands of the fractions are marked byarrows: large subunit of ribulose 1,5-diphosphate carboxylase (LSU) and NADPH-protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 4Immunoblot analysis of ferredoxin and ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase in etioplasts. The stroma (lanes 3) and membranes (lanes 4), corresponding to about 5×106 etioplasts, were loaded on a 17% polyacrylamide gel. Ferredoxin (0.5 μg,lane 1) and ferredoxin-NADP+oxidoreductase (0.005 units, lane 5) from spinach were used as standard proteins. Chloroplasts of barley (lanes 2), which contain both ferredoxin and the enzyme, were used for comparison between spinach and barley. The gel was blotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and incubated with antibodies against ferredoxin (A) and ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase (B). The antibodies were visualized by the ECL technique. The positions of ferredoxin (A) and of ferredoxin-NADP+oxidoreductase (B) are indicated by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)These intact etioplasts were incubated in isotonic medium at 24 °C for 90 min with phytyl-POP and ZnPheide b. It is necessary to perform etioplast preparation and the assay in darkness or under very dim green safe light, because light causes phototransformation of endogenous protochlorophyllide a to Chlide a, which will be esterified with phytyl-POP to Chl a. We used ZnPheide b rather than Chlide b as a substrate for reduction in most experiments. Thus, we were able to distinguish between Chl a produced by the undesired light effect upon endogenous substrate and ZnPhe a, the product of reduction of the exogenous substrate. Furthermore, the zinc compounds are more stable against demetallation than the magnesium compounds.The etioplasts contain protochlorophyllide a and traces of esterified protochlorophyll a (Fig.3 a). We obtained significant amounts of ZnPhe a and Zn-71-OH-Phe afrom ZnPheide b (Fig. 3 b). ZnPhe a had never been obtained before with lysed etioplasts. Because some etioplasts may be lysed in the course of the assay, we reisolated the intact etioplasts after the assay and analyzed their pigment content. The yield of ZnPhe a relative to Zn-71-OH-Phea was significantly higher in the reisolated organelles (Fig. 3, compare c with b), clearly showing that the second step of reduction is restricted to intact etioplasts under our experimental conditions. Only the first reduction occurs in lysed etioplasts when NADPH is supplied. Thus, lysis leads to the loss of a factor different from NADPH that is necessary for the second but not for the first reduction step. The most probable explanation is loss of a soluble factor by dilution of the stroma during lysis.A possible candidate for a stromal factor necessary for the second reduction of 71-OH-Chl a to Chl amight be ferredoxin. Ferredoxin is not only involved in electron transfer to NADP+ in photosynthesis or to dinitrogen in nitrogen fixation, but is also an essential cofactor of plastid-located fatty acid desaturases (36Schmidt H. Heinz E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9477-9480Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), of pheophorbide oxygenase (15Hörtensteiner S. Vicentini F. Matile P. New Phytol. 1995; 129: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and of plant heme oxygenase (37Beale S.I. Cornejo C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22328-22332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is notable that animal heme oxygenase uses NADPH rather than ferredoxin. Ferredoxin and the enzyme ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase are present in etioplasts as was shown by immunoblotting (Fig. 4,A and B); we loaded a gel with the stroma and membranes of barley etioplasts and barley chloroplasts together with authentic ferredoxin and ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase from spinach. The proteins were blotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and we incubated the membrane with antibodies against ferredoxin and ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase. After visualizing by the ECL technique, we detected ferredoxin in the stroma of etioplasts and ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase in the stroma and membranes of etioplasts and in chloroplasts. The molecular weight of spinach ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase is slightly smaller, and that of spinach ferredoxin is slightly larger, than that of the barley proteins. The specificity of the reaction was demonstrated by immunodecoration after preincubation of the antibody with an excess of ferredoxin. The signals corresponding to ferredoxin disappeared, whereas two other bands appearing in the stroma of chloroplasts were still visible, due to nonspecific reaction of the antiserum (data not shown).Because ferredoxin was detected in etioplasts, the observed results might be explained as follows. The concentration of reduced ferredoxin could be high enough for Chl a production in intact plastids, but lysis of the plastids would dilute ferredoxin so that Chla was no longer formed. To test this hypothesis, ferredoxin was added together with ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase, NADPH, glucose 6-phosphate, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase to the sample with lysed etioplasts. A peak at the position of ZnPhea (peak 3, Fig. 5 A) was observed with this reduced ferredoxin (Fig. 5 A). A similar reduction was achieved when Chlide b was used instead of ZnPheide b; a peak at the position of Chla (peak 7, Fig. 5 B) appeared under the same conditions (Fig. 5 B). Besides the retention times, the absorption spectra of the peaks proved that peak 5 (Fig. 5 B) was 71-OH-Chl a (Fig. 5 C), peak 6 was the esterified substrate Chl b (Fig. 5 D), and peak 7 was Chl a (Fig. 5 E). However, ferredoxin alone without its reducing system caused no reduction (data not shown). Whereas the product 71-OHChl a also appeared with NADPH alone or together with glucose 6-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, Chl a was not formed under these conditions (Fig. 5 B). This agrees with the previous finding (18Ito H. Ohtsuka T. Tanaka A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1475-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 20Scheumann V. Helfrich M. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. Z. Naturforsch. Teil C Biochem. Biophys. Biol. Virol. 1996; 51: 185-194Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) that 71-OH-Chl a is the intermediate in the reduction of the formyl group to the methyl group. Although the fluorescence excitation and emission wavelengths were adjusted for Zn-71-OH-Phe a and 71-OH-Chl a, respectively, the amount of the esterified b-type pigments was high enough to observe them as a small peak (peaks 2 and 6) in this experiment.The results in Fig. 5 show that either Chlide b or ZnPheideb can be used as substrate to study the reduction of the formyl group. In standard assays, we always used the zinc compounds to distinguish between exogenous and endogenous pigments.To compare different substrates and cofactors, we standardized the reaction conditions. Fig. 6 shows the time course of the second reduction step, namely of Zn-71-OH-Pheide a to ZnPheide a with reduced ferredoxin. We used the 71-OH intermediate of the Chl b reductase reaction and omitted the esterification reaction so that the second reduction step alone was measured. The amount of product was determined by HPLC (not shown). Linear reaction kinetics were observed up to 90 min. This reaction period was used in all further experiments. Without the addition of ferredoxin, no ZnPheide a was formed.Figure 6Time course of the reduction of zinc 71-OH-pheophorbide ato zinc pheophorbideaby reduced ferredoxin in lysed etioplasts (8.5 × 107/sample). The percentage of formed reduced pigment added Zn-71-OH-Pheid a (about 450 pmol) was calculated on the basis of NADPH, glucose 6-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were added without (▴) or with ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase and ferredoxin (♦). The reaction proceeded linearly for 90 min under the conditions used. Because all solutions are stored on ice, they require a short time to reach the reaction temperature of 28 °C. This explains the delay occurring in the first 15 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We then studied the effect of ferredoxin for both substrates, ZnPheideb and Zn-71-OH-Pheide a, with or without esterification using lysed etioplasts (Table I). Formation of ZnPhe a in incubations with phytyl-POP or of ZnPheide a incubated without phytyl-POP was detected only when reduced ferredoxin was present. This series of experiments confirmed the reduction of ZnPhe(ide) b to Zn-71-OH-Phe(ide) awithout ferredoxin, i.e. with NADPH alone. However, the second reduction step required ferredoxin irrespective of the esterification status of the substrate pigment. It is notable that incubation with Zn-71OH-Pheide a never resulted in formation of ZnPheide b or ZnPhe b, indicating that the first step of the Chl b to Chla conversion is not reversible under our experimental conditions.Table IReduction of zinc pheophorbide b and zinc 71-OH-pheophorbide a, respectively, in lysed etioplasts of barley with or without esterification and with or without reduced ferredoxinSubstrate (Zn-Pheide)ProductFdphytyl-POPZn-71-OH-Phe(ide)aZn-Phe(ide) a%%b−+820b++7411b+−77771-OH−+071-OH++2071-OH+−15ZnPheide b (700 pmol) or Zn-71-OH-Pheidea (400 pmol) was added to 8.5 × 107 purified, lysed etioplasts with or without phytyl-POP and with or without ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase and ferredoxin (Fd). The NADPH-regenerating system consisting of NADPH, glucose 6-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was added to all samples. The incubation time was 90 min at 28 °C. The values of the products are expressed as percentages of the total extracted (nonesterified) and of the total esterified pigment, respectively. The reduction of Zn-71-OH-Pheide a to ZnPhe a or ZnPheidea in lysed etioplasts is only possible if reduced ferredoxin is present. Open table in a new tab Ito et al. (17Ito H. Takaichi S. Tsuji H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1475-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) showed that ATP was required for formation of Chl a. Because these authors worked with a mixture of intact and lysed etioplasts, we tested the effect of ATP separately with intact and lysed etioplasts (Fig.7). We confirmed the enhancement effect of ATP on the second reduction step when intact etioplasts were used. This was true for both substrates, ZnPheide b (Fig.7 A) and Zn-71-OH-Pheide a (Fig.7 B). The same enhancement was found when dihydroxyacetone phosphate was added to intact etioplasts instead of or together with ATP (data not shown). ATP, however, did not stimulate the second step of reduction in lysed etioplasts when reduced ferredoxin was present (Fig. 7, A and B); in this case, ATP had a slight inhibitory effect on reduction. The yield of the first step, reduction of ZnPhe(ide) b to Zn-71-OH-Phe(ide)a, was slightly increased by ATP in both intact and lysed etioplasts (Fig. 7 A).Figure 7Effect of ATP upon the reduction of zinc pheophorbide b(A) and zinc 71-OH-pheophorbide a(B) in intact and lysed etioplasts. Intact etioplasts (8.5×107/sample) were incubated for 90 min at 28 °C with NADPH and phytyldiphosphate. Lysed etioplasts were incubated, in addition, with the ferredoxin-reducing system as in Fig. 5. The values are the means of 4–10 experiments. The amount of the total esterified pigment (sum of ZnPhe b, Zn-71-OH-Phea, and ZnPhe a) varied between 400 and 600 pmol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Preliminary experiments were carried out to test the localization of Chl b reductase activity. For this purpose, the etioplast membranes were washed twice to completely remove the stroma. As shown in Fig. 8, the first and second reduction steps were shown to be present in the etioplast membranes. Freezing and thawing reduced total activity and mainly the activity of the first enzymatic step; however, this procedure did not destroy the activity completely. When the sample was incubated with reduced ferredoxin, the presence of stroma had only little additional stimulatory effect on Chlb reduction. No reduction was observed with the stroma alone (data not shown).Figure 8Activity of chlorophyll breductase in washed etioplast membranes. Aliquots of 8.5 × 107 lysed etioplasts were used directly (1), or aliquots of twice-washed membranes prepared from identical aliquots (2) or washed membranes prepared from etioplasts after a freeze-thaw cycle (3) were used. Incubation with ZnPheide b and the ferredoxin-reducing system was as in Fig. 5. The values of Zn-71-OH-Phea and ZnPhe a are expressed as the percentage of the total esterified pigment (about 350 pmol) and are the means of two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONWe previously showed that barley etioplasts, purified via a Percoll gradient and lysed before the enzyme assay, catalyzed only the first step of the Chl b reductase reaction, namely the reduction of ZnPheide b to Zn-71-OH-Pheidea or (with phytyl-POP) to Zn-71-OH-Phea (22Scheumann V. Ito H. Tanaka A. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). By way of contrast, crude etioplasts, prepared by a rapid centrifugation procedure, also catalyzed (at least in part) the second step to ZnPhe a. We have demonstrated in the present paper that this difference was caused by the presence of intact etioplasts in the crude preparation. When we purified intact etioplasts after conducting the reduction reaction, the ratio ZnPhea/Zn-71-OH-Phe a was even higher than observed with the crude preparation, which consisted of a mixture of intact and lysed etioplasts. Reactions occurring inside intact organelles require substrate penetration through the envelope when these compounds are added exogenously. Penetration of phytyl-POP and geranylgeranyl-POP through the envelope of etioplasts and chloroplasts has been demonstrated (38Benz J. Hampp R. Rüdiger W. Planta. 1981; 152: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 39Benz J. Lempert U. Rüdiger W. Planta. 1984; 162: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and penetration of Chlide aand Pheide a through the etioplast envelope into prothylakoids and prolamellar bodies that contain the chlorophyll synthase activity (40Lütz C. Benz J. Rüdiger W. Z. Naturforsch. Teil C Biochem. Biophys. Biol. Virol. 1981; 36: 58-61Google Scholar, 41Lindsten A. Welch C.J. Schoch S. Ryberg M. Rüdiger W. Sundqvist C. Physiol. Plant. 1990; 80: 277-285Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) has also been shown (42Pöpperl G. Oster U. Blos I. Rüdiger W. Z. Naturforsch. Teil C Biochem. Biophys. Biol. Virol. 1997; 52: 144-152Google Scholar). Penetration of ZnPheide b into intact etioplasts, previously assumed to be due to stabilization of Chl a-binding apoproteins (43Eichacker L.A. Helfrich M. Rüdiger W. Müller B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32174-32179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), can be deduced by its esterification when it was added together with phytyl-POP; the phytylated pigment was detected after extraction from reisolated intact etioplasts (Fig. 3 c). Furthermore, the results of reduction discussed below can only be understood with the assumption that these substrates penetrate into intact etioplasts. The penetration of several tetrapyrroles through the plastid envelope has been reported; formation of esterified Chl after infiltration of etiolated leaves with Chlide (20Scheumann V. Helfrich M. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. Z. Naturforsch. Teil C Biochem. Biophys. Biol. Virol. 1996; 51: 185-194Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 21Vezitskii A.Y. Shcherbakov R.A. Photosynthetica. 1988; 22: 184-189Google Scholar) requires penetration of the substrates not only through the plasmalemma but also through the etioplast envelope, since esterification occurs inside the etioplast. Exogenous protoporphyrin passes into plastids for the magnesium chelatase reaction (42Pöpperl G. Oster U. Blos I. Rüdiger W. Z. Naturforsch. Teil C Biochem. Biophys. Biol. Virol. 1997; 52: 144-152Google Scholar), and endogenous protoporphyrinogen, produced in plastids, passes through the plastid membrane for further metabolism in mitochondria or to diffuse throughout the cell after overproduction in plastids (for a review, see Ref. 6Rüdiger W. Phytochemistry. 1997; 46: 1151-1167Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Further, phytochromobilin, produced in plastids, passes through the plastid membrane for incorporation into phytochrome apoprotein in the cytoplasm (44Terry M.J. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22215-22221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and magnesium protoporphyrin, produced in the plastids, also passes into the cytosol, forming a signal for transcription of nuclear genes (45Kropat J. Oster U. Rüdiger W. Beck C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14168-14172Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We do not yet know whether the tetrapyrroles penetrate the plastid membrane by passive diffusion or whether a specific transport system is present. The possibility of a light-activated transport of magnesium protoporphyrin from chloroplasts to the cytosol inChlamydomonas cells has been discussed by Kropat"

(hydroxyapatite, octacalcium phosphate, and tricalcium phosphate) crystals are common in osteoarthritis (OA) and are associated with severe degenerative arthropathies (1Halverson P.B. McCarty D.J. Koopman W.J. Arthritis and Allied Conditions: A Textbook of Rheumatology. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1997: 2127-2146Google Scholar). The prevalence of BCP crystals in synovial fluid from patients with knee OA is between 30 and 60%, and their presence correlates strongly with radiographic evidence of cartilage degeneration (2Halverson P.B. McCarty D.J. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1986; 45: 603-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Larger joint effusions are seen in affected joints when compared with joint fluid from OA knees without BCP crystals (3Carroll G.J. Stuart R.A. Armstrong J.A. Breidahl P.D. Laing B.A. J . Rheumatol. 1991; 18: 861-866PubMed Google Scholar). Clinical and pathological studies have demonstrated that synovial lining proliferation of varying degrees is associated with BCP crystals in osteoarthritis (4McCarty D.J. Halverson P.B. Carrera G.F. Brewer B.J. Kozin F.K. Arthritis & Rheum. 1981; 24: 464-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). BCP crystals themselves are at least partly responsible for such proliferation since they stimulate cell replication in vitro (5Cheung H.S. Story M.T. McCarty D.J. Arthritis & Rheum. 1984; 27: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Increased cellularity in the synovial lining enhances the capacity for secretion of cytokines, which may promote chondrolysis. Non-inflammatory destruction of matrix-rich articular structures including cartilage, ligament, and tendon is also characteristic of BCP crystal deposition (1Halverson P.B. McCarty D.J. Koopman W.J. Arthritis and Allied Conditions: A Textbook of Rheumatology. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1997: 2127-2146Google Scholar). BCP crystals promote tissue damage by induction of matrix metalloprotease (MMP) synthesis and secretion. Since there are no available drugs to inhibit deposition or affect reabsorption of these crystals, prevention of the biological consequences of the destructive processes initiated by BCP crystals is an attractive therapeutic strategy. The in vitro effects of BCP crystals emphasize their pathogenic potential. BCP crystals induce mitogenesis in cultured fibroblasts (5Cheung H.S. Story M.T. McCarty D.J. Arthritis & Rheum. 1984; 27: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 6Mitchell P.G. Pledger W.J. Cheung H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14071-14077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, mechanisms by which BCP crystals induce mitogenesis have been incompletely studied. Endocytosis and intracellular dissolution of the crystals, producing an elevated cytoplasmic calcium concentration, are important (7Cheung H.S. McCarty D.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1985; 157: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). BCP crystals activate a protein kinase signal transduction pathway involving p42 and p44 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases (8Nair D. Misra R.P. Sallis J.D. Cheung H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18920-18925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Current data suggest that BCP crystals enhance phospholipase C activity in synovial fibroblasts (9Rothenberg R. Cheung H. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: C554-C559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If BCP crystals increase phospholipase C activity, resultant diacylglycerol accumulation followed by increased protein kinase C (PKC) activity should ensue. This postulate is supported in a study by Mitchell et al. (6Mitchell P.G. Pledger W.J. Cheung H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14071-14077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who found that BCP crystal-induced mitogenesis in Balb/c/3T3 fibroblasts was inhibited when PKC was down-regulated using the tumor-promoting phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol 13-acetate (TPA), an analogue of diacylglycerol. Another index of PKC activation is translocation of the enzyme from the cytosolic compartment to the membrane compartment of the cell, and we have shown increased membrane-associated PKC activity in porcine chondrocytes treated with BCP crystals (10Mitchell P.G. Struve J.A. McCarthy G.M. Cheung H.S. Arthritis & Rheum. 1992; 35: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the mitogenic response to BCP crystals involves activation of PKC. However, BCP crystal-induced activation of PKC in human cultures has not been reported. A potentially important pathway of crystal-induced cell activation involves transcription factor, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). Present in the cytoplasm of most cell types, NF-κB is critical to many signal transduction pathways, including those leading to cell replication and oncogenesis, and is induced during the G0 to G1transition of mitogenesis in murine fibroblasts (11Baldwin A. Clifford Azizkahn J. Jensen D. Beg A. Coodly L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4943-4951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The best characterized form of NF-κB consists of a heterodimer composed of a 50-kDa (p50) and a 65-kDa (p65) (also called RelA) subunit (12Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5578) Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells, NF-κB is found in the cytoplasm bound to IκB (inhibitor κB), a member of a family of inhibitor proteins that prevents it from entering the nucleus. When cells are exposed to inducers of NF-κB, two serine residues of IκB are phosphorylated by specific IκB kinases causing its rapid degradation by the 26 S proteasome and loss of NF-κB inhibitory activity (13Chen Z.J. Parent L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1996; 84: 853-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). NF-κB is thus released to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription of target genes. BCP crystals induce mitogenesis, but their ability to activate NF-κB has not previously been studied. Alternatively, crystal-induced mitogenesis may derive from other pathways. The cellular effects of many growth-promoting agents are mediated by high affinity receptor protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) (14Fantl W.J. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 453-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the binding of ligand to the extracellular domain induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain. This leads to recruitment and downstream activation of a number of common signaling molecules including PTK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3 kinase) (15Kapeller R. Cantley L.C. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Phosphoinositides play a key role in signal transduction, and the 3-phosphoinositide pathway has been implicated in growth factor-dependent mitogenesis (16Roche S. Koegl M. Courtneidge S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9185-9189Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Production of 3-phosphoinositides requires PTK-mediated recruitment and activation of PI3 kinase (15Kapeller R. Cantley L.C. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) and monosodium urate crystals induce protein tyrosine phosphorylation in human neutrophils (17Gaudry M. Roberge C.J. de Medicis R. Lussier A. Poubelle P.E. Naccache P.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1649-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). PI3 kinase is also involved in CPPD and monosodium urate crystal-induced neutrophil activation (18Jackson J.K. Lauener R. Duronio V. Burt H.M. J. Rheumatol. 1997; 24: 341-348PubMed Google Scholar), but the role of either in BCP crystal-induced activation of neutrophils, fibroblasts, or chondrocytes has not been reported. Transduction pathways resulting in protease synthesis and secretion are likely active in BCP crystal-induced arthritis. Probable effectors of tissue damage from BCP crystals are MMPs, including collagenase-1 (MMP-1), stromelysin (MMP-3), 92-kDa gelatinase (gelatinase B/MMP-9), and collagenase-3 (MMP-13) (19McCarthy G.M. Mitchell P.G. Struve J.S. Cheung H.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 153: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 20McCarthy G. Macius A. Christopherson P. Ryan L. Pourmotabbed T. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1998; 57: 56-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 21McCarthy G. Christopherson P. Mitchell P. Arthritis & Rheum. 1997; 40 (abstr.): 127Google Scholar). The collagenase promotor contains a cis element termed the TPA response element (TRE), which is involved in increased transcription in response to agonists including tumor necrosis factor α and phorbol esters (22Brenner D. O'Hara M. Angel P. Chojkier M. Karin M. Nature. 1989; 337: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 23Angel P. Baumann I. Stein B. Delius H. Rahmsdorf H. Herrich P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2256-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Increased transcription through the TRE depends on the transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1), a heterodimer composed of the protein products of c-fos and c-jun, both primary response genes, which interact to stimulate transcription of AP-1-responsive genes. BCP crystals induce c-fos and c-jun mRNA accumulation in human fibroblasts (HF) and inhibitors of protein synthesis such as cycloheximide block BCP crystal induction of MMP mRNA (19McCarthy G.M. Mitchell P.G. Struve J.S. Cheung H.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 153: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 24Cheung H. Sallis J. Struve J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1315: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This suggests that synthesis of a transactivating complex containing Fos and Jun proteins, such as AP-1, is necessary for BCP crystal induction of MMPs. In the present study, we demonstrate that the mitogenic response to BCP crystals is associated with PKC activation in HF and NF-κB induction in Balb/c/3T3 and HF. We confirm that BCP crystals induce the transcription factor AP-1, and we show that the PKC inhibitor, staurosporine, inhibits BCP crystal induction of c-fos, but not c-jun, mRNA in HF. In contrast, we show that BCP crystals do not activate PI3 kinase or tyrosine kinases confirming that cell activation by BCP crystals is selective in mechanism.

The c-fos probe was a 1.3-kilobase pairPstI v-fos fragment from the pfos-1/plasmid supplied by I. Verma (Salk Institute, San Diego, CA) (25Curran T. Peters G. van Beveren C. Teich N. Verma I. J. Virol. 1982; 44: 674-682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The c-jun probe was a 0.9-kilobase pairBamHI/PstI insert from the RSV-cJ plasmid, supplied by Dr. Michael Karin (University of California, San Diego) (26Angel P. Allegretto E. Okino S. Hattori K. Boyle W. Hunter T. Karin M. Nature. 1988; 332: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). The pHcGAP plasmid containing glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA (27Tso J.Y. Sun X.H. Kao T.H. Reece K.S. Wu R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2485-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar) was from the American Type Culture Collection (27Tso J.Y. Sun X.H. Kao T.H. Reece K.S.

Recombinant human interleukin-1β (IL-1β) was from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) and phosphatidylserine were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). PtdIns, PtdIns(4)P, and PtdIns(4,5)P2 were from Calbiochem. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) and latex beads (particles 0.46 μm in diameter) were from Sigma. Diamond dust (particles 1–5 μm long) was obtained from A. Landau Co. (Philadelphia, PA). Colorado calf serum was from the Colorado Serum Co (Denver, CO). Bovine calf serum, fetal bovine serum (FBS), Hanks' buffered saline solution, and DMEM were from Life Technologies, Inc. A model system of human foreskin fibroblast (HF) cultures was used for these experiments since HF responses to BCP crystals have been shown to be similar to those of synovial fibroblasts (5Cheung H.S. Story M.T. McCarty D.J. Arthritis & Rheum. 1984; 27: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). HF cultures were established from explants and transferred as described previously (28McCarthy G.M. Mitchell P.G. Cheung H.S. Arthritis & Rheum. 1991; 34: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). They were grown and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS containing 1% penicillin, streptomycin, and Fungizone (PSF). All experiments were performed on confluent cell monolayers that had been rendered quiescent by removing the media, washing with DMEM alone, and subsequently incubating in DMEM containing 0.5% FBS and 1% PSF for 24 h. All cultures used were 3rd or 4th passage cells. Balb/c/3T3 (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) cultures were grown and maintained in DMEM with 10% Colorado calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. When approximately 70% confluent, cultures were rendered quiescent by incubating in DMEM containing 0.5% Colorado calf serum for 24 h prior to experiments. NIH 3T3 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were grown to confluence in 24-well plates and rendered quiescent by incubation in 0.5% FBS for 24 h. [3H]Thymidine (1 μCi/ml) was added to the wells 23 h after the addition of 10% FBS, TPA (200 nm), or BCP crystals (18 μg/cm2) in the presence or absence of varying concentrations of staurosporine and pulse-labeled for 1 h. Control cultures were in 0.5% FBS with or without varying concentrations of staurosporine. The cells were then washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and macromolecules were precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid solution. The precipitate was washed again with PBS and dissolved in 1 ml 0.1 n NaOH, 1% SDS. Levels of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable3H were determined in triplicate, using a liquid scintillation counter (Packard Instruments, Downers Grove, IL). BCP crystals were synthesized by a modification of published methods (29Evans R.W. Cheung H.S. McCarty D.J. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1984; 36: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Mineral prepared by this method has a calcium/phosphate molar ratio of 1.59 and contains partially carbonate-substituted hydroxyapatite with admixed octacalcium phosphate shown by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The crystals were crushed and sieved to yield 10–20-μm aggregates, which were sterilized and rendered pyrogen-free by heating at 200 °C for 90 min. Heating to 200 °C did not alter the crystal character or the relationship of hydroxyapatite and octacalcium phosphate, as confirmed by x-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Crystals were weighed and suspended by sonication in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). The crystal suspension was sonicated again just prior to use. The amounts of crystals used were determined based on our previous studies of dose-response relationships between BCP crystals and the mitogenic response (5Cheung H.S. Story M.T. McCarty D.J. Arthritis & Rheum. 1984; 27: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In those studies, maximal mitogenic responses were achieved with BCP levels of 50–100 μg/ml. These levels are equivalent to concentrations of BCP crystals found in pathologic joint fluids. Cells were washed in PBS and lysed in E buffer (0.3% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 60 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)) by 5 min of incubation on ice. Nuclei were pelleted by spinning for 5 min at 2,500 rpm at 4 °C in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge, and the supernatant was saved as the cytoplasmic extract prior to SDS-PAGE through 10% polyacrylamide gels (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar). Glycerol was added to cytoplasmic extracts to a final concentration of 20%, after which the extracts were stored at −80 °C until use. Nuclear extracts were washed in buffer E without Nonidet P-40 and resuspended in 40 μl of C buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 0.75 mm spermidine, 0.15 mmspermine, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF). NaCl was added to a concentration of 0.4 m, and the nuclei were gently shaken for 10 min at 4 °C. The nuclei were then pelleted by spinning for 10 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge, and the nuclear extract supernatant was stored at −70 °C until use. The protein content of cell extracts was determined using the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad) (31Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216377) Google Scholar). EMSA was performed using a radiolabeled probe, UV 21, designed for cross-linking studies. This probe is derived from a template oligonucleotide UV1 (CAGGGCTGGGGATTCCCCATCTCCACAGTTTCACTTC) corresponding to bases −178 to −141 of the region 1 enhancer of the H-2K b gene which contains a strong κB motif. UV1 was annealed to primer UV2 (GAAGTGAAAC-TGTGG) and extended with Klenow fragment in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP as described previously (32Scheinmann R.I. Beg A. Baldwin A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6089-6101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The AP-1 probe is described under “Materials.” Binding reactions were performed by first incubating 2 μg of nuclear extract with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) in binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.7, 50 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA) for 10 min at room temperature. Approximately 10,000 cpm of probe was then added and allowed to bind for approximately 30 min. Some nuclear extracts were treated with IκB (recombinant IκBα expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using histidine tags) prior to addition of the UV 21 probe. The reaction mix was then loaded onto native 5% acrylamide gels, prepared with 0.25× TBE (22.3 mm Tris, 22.3 mm borate, 0.5 mm EDTA). Supershift experiments were performed by incubating binding reaction mixes with 1 μl of antiserum for 15 min at room temperature. The polyclonal antibody against p50 (Ab1141) is generated in rabbits and is raised against a peptide fragment made from amino acids 2–15 of human p105. The anti-p65 antibody (Ab5192) is polyclonal antisera against the C terminus of human p65. Gels were analyzed either by autoradiography or with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Northern blot analysis of total cellular RNA was used to study the expression of c-fos and c-jun mRNA in HF after stimulation with BCP crystals in the presence or absence of the PKC inhibitor staurosporine. Confluent, quiescent monolayer cultures of HF in 100-mm plates were washed twice with cold PBS 24 h after treatment. Total RNA was recovered by precipitation with 4m LiCl as described by Cathala et al. (33Cathala G. Savouret J. Mendez B. West B.L. Karin M. Martial J.A. Baxter J.D. DNA (N. Y.). 1983; 2: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). Five micrograms of total cellular RNA was fractionated on a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel; ribosomal RNA was visualized with ethidium bromide, and the fractionated RNA was transferred to nitrocellulose filters (34Davis L.G. Dibner M.D. Battey J.F. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1986: 143-146Crossref Google Scholar). Hybridization of the filters with DNA probes was performed overnight at 42 °C. Probes were labeled using the random primer method, and [α-32P]dATP, to a specific activity of >5 × 108 cpm/μg (35Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar). The filters were washed at a maximal stringency of 0.25× standard saline citrate (SSC, 1× SSC = 0.15 m sodium chloride, 0.015 msodium citrate, pH 7.0) at 60 °C for 30 min. Autoradiography was performed with Kodak XAR-5 film (Eastman Kodak Co.), and signal intensity was quantified by scanning laser densitometry (LKB Instruments, Stockholm, Sweden). Confluent cultures of HF grown in 100-mm plates were washed twice in cold PBS and then harvested in 1.5 ml of translocation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.33 m sucrose) (36Gusovsky F. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 124-129PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were sonicated on ice for 15 s and then centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 45 min. The supernatant was used as the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was then dissolved in 0.5 ml of translocation buffer containing Triton X-100 (0.1% w/v), shaken at 4 °C overnight, and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant was used as the membrane fraction. Samples (20 μl) of cytosolic and membrane fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE in 10% polyacrylamide gels. Plates were washed 2 times in cold PBS and then scraped into 1 ml of buffer A (0.3 m sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 0.3% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10 mg/ml pepstatin, 10 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor) and sonicated for 30 s. The cell lysate was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min, and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100 and then applied to 200 ml of DEAE-Sepharose minicolumns equilibrated in buffer B (buffer A without sucrose). The columns were then washed with 1 ml of buffer B and eluted with 1 ml of buffer C (buffer B + 0.15 m NaCl). Prior experiments determined that 0.15 m NaCl eluted the majority of the PKC activity. 25 ml samples were then assayed for PKC activity using a PKC assay kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). This assay is a modification of the mixed micelle assay and utilizes a peptide that is specifically phosphorylated on threonine by PKC (37Mitchell P. Cheung H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1133-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 38Hannun Y. Loomis C. Bell R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10039-10043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assay conditions and separation of the phosphorylated peptide were as described in the instructions supplied with the kit. After electrophoresis, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes overnight at 4 °C. After transfer, the membranes were blocked in 2.5% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (20 mm Tris, 500 mmNaCl, pH 7.5). The membranes were washed twice with Tween 20 wash solution (20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) (TTBS). The membranes were then incubated for 1 h with antibody buffer (0.1% non-fat dry milk-TTBS) containing a 1:500 or 1:1000 dilution of primary antibodies. The blots were then washed with TTBS and incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h. The blots were washed with TTBS and incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase/streptavidin for 1 h. Membranes were washed twice with TTBS and once with TBS. Immunoreactive bands were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (ECL) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Adherent fibroblasts in 100-mm plates were solubilized in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaF, 20 mm NaP2O7, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 1 mm PMSF. The Triton-insoluble fraction was pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 4 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated with equal amounts of the appropriate antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C, and the antibody immunoprecipitates were collected on protein G-agarose for an additional hour. Immune complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer, twice with 100 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 500 mm LiCl, and twice with TNE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). All washes were supplemented with 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mmPMSF. For PI3 kinase assay, immune complexes were analyzed as described below. For gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting, immune complexes were solubilized in 2× concentrated SDS-containing sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Immunoreactive proteins were detected by ECL as above. Washed anti-PI3K immunoprecipitates were incubated on ice for 10 min in 20 μl of a sonicated substrate mixture containing PtdIns(4,5)P2 and phosphatidylserine (1:1) at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Reactions were initiated by addition of 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm MgCl2, 50 μm ATP, 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 6000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products). After 10 min at 37 °C, the reactions were terminated with 200 μl of 1 n HCl. Next, CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1) (400 μl) was added, and the phospholipids were extracted. The aqueous layer was aspirated, and the CHCl3 layer was washed once with 160 μl of CH3OH/1 n HCl (1:1). The resulting CHCl3 layer was dried with nitrogen gas, and the phospholipid residues were solubilized in CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1). Radiolabeled PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was separated from PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(4)P standards by thin layer chromatography (TLC"

Phagocytosis of latex beads by human macrophages was allowed in the presence or absence of purified porin. Isolation of latex bead-containing phagosomes and subsequent two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed substantial differences in the phagosomal protein composition. Immunoblotting detected higher amounts of annexin II and the early endocytic markers Rab5 and transferrin receptor and decreased levels of the late endocytic markers Rab7 and cathepsin D in phagosomes obtained in the presence of porin compared with those obtained in its absence. Furthermore, association of Rab4 with the latex bead-containing phagosomes was revealed by flow cytometry. The amount of this small GTPase was markedly higher in the phagosomes isolated in the presence of porin.

Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the causative agent of the sexually transmitted disease gonorrhea, colonizes the mucosae of the urethra, endocervix, conjunctiva, fallopian tube, rectum, and pharynx. Occasionally, however, gonococci disseminate to cause severe diseases including bacteremia, which may lead to clinical complications such as purulent arthritis, pelvic inflammatory disease, endocarditis, and meningitis (1Ryan K.J. Sherris J.C. Champoux J.J. Frederick L.C. Neidhardt C. Plorde J.J. Ray C.G. Ryan K.J. Medical Microbiology: An Introduction to Infectious Diseases. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1990: 343-356Google Scholar). Phagocytic cells, such as monocytes, may play a role in the dissemination of gonococci. Gonococci may encounter and survive the intracellular processing of phagocytic cells (2Shafer W.M. Rest R.F. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1989; 43: 121-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 3Casey S.G. Shafer W.M. Spitznagel J.K. Infect. Immun. 1986; 52: 384-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An important determinant thought to contribute to survival of these gonococci in host cells is porin (PorB). PorB, the most abundant outer membrane protein in N. gonorrhoeae (4Johnston K.H. Holmes K.K. Gotschlich E.J. J. Exp. Med. 1976; 143: 741-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), functions as a classical porin, serving as an ion and nutrient transport channel in the outer membrane (5Benz R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 359-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the porin of pathogenic Neisseriareportedly translocates from the outer membrane of the gonococci into artificial membranes (6Lynch E.C. Blake M.S. Gotschlich E.C. Mauro A. Biophys. J. 1984; 45: 104-107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) as well as into that of the host cell (7Blake M.S. Gotschlich E.C. Inouye M. Bacterial Outer Membranes as Model Systems.

The notion that PorB plays an important role in virulence comes from epidemiological observations indicating a strong association of certain variant forms of PorB, i.e.PorBIA, 1The abbreviations used are: PorBIA and PorBIB, proteins IA and IB (structurally related forms of gonococcal porins, i.e. P.IA and P.IB), respectively; LP, latex bead phagosome; LP+, latex bead phagosome(s) prepared in the presence of PorB; LP−, latex bead phagosome(s) prepared in the absence of PorB; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; TfR, transferrin receptor; HLA-DR, human leukocyte antigen DR-α. with disseminated gonococcal infections, whereas PorBIB-expressing strains have mostly been isolated from patients with local infections (10Sandstrom E.G. Knapp J.S. Reller L.B. Thompson S.E. Hook III, E.W. Holmes K.K. Sex. Transm. Dis. 1984; 11: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This linkage has been supported by in vitroobservations showing that meningococcal porin transfers into the lipid bilayer at a higher rate (1500 pores/h) compared with the PorBIA (100 pores/h) and PorBIB (5–10 pores/h) porins of N. gonorrhoeae. The nonpathogenic Neisseria sicca did not transfer porin function to the bilayer (6Lynch E.C. Blake M.S. Gotschlich E.C. Mauro A. Biophys.

Translocation of purified PorB into the host cell membrane affects the antibactericidal activity of the activated polymorphonuclear cells and initiates a series of events that include a transient change in the membrane potential (11Haines K.A.

Solberg C.O. Wetzler L.M. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 160-167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations have led to the speculation that PorB may play a role in the modification of the maturation of the phagocytic vacuole, thus facilitating bacterial intracellular survival. Recently, we described an intriguing similarity of PorB to eukaryotic or mitochondrial porins with regard to both structural and physicochemical features and their binding of nucleotide triphosphates (15Rudel T. Schmid A. Benz R. Kolb H.-L. Lang F. Meyer T.F. Cell. 1996; 85: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Interestingly, purified PorB induces a calcium influx, and its channel activity in the eukaryotic membrane appears to be regulated by ATP/GTP. 2A. Müller, D. Günther, F. Düx, M. Naumann, T. F. Meyer, and T. Rudel, submitted for publication. Phagosome maturation is a complex process and involves a dynamic exchange of phagosomal components with several intracellular compartments (17Beron W. Alvarez-Dominguez C. Mayorga L. Stahl P.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 100-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Soon after ingestion of a particle or a microorganism, a series of sequential membrane fusion and budding takes place, which leads to maturation of the phagosome, and delivery of lysosomal markers and enzymes causes destruction of the ingested material. Recent reports have suggested that, during maturation, phagosomes fuse with early (18Hart P.D. Young M.R. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 19Mayorga L.S.

Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). The level of soluble contents of maturating phagosomes, including the lysosomal hydrolases cathepsin D and β-glucuronidase, increases markedly over a period of time after internalization (22Pitt A. Mayorga L.S. Stahl P.D. Schwartz A.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1978-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Maturating phagosomes were shown to acquire the late endosomal small GTP-binding protein marker Rab7 and to lose the early endosomal marker Rab5 (24Desjardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Members of the Rab subfamily are believed to govern vesicular transport (vesicle docking/fusion) in the exocytic and endocytic vesicles in mammalian cells (25Goud B. McCaffrey M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 26Pfeffer S.R. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 41-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 27Hall A. Zerial M. Zerial M. Huber L.A. Guidebook to the Small GTPases.

Huber L.A. Guidebook to the Small GTPases. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 3-11Google Scholar). Several studies have suggested that fusion and budding in the phagocytic pathway are regulated by the Rab subfamily since proteins such as Rab5 and Rab7 and other small GTPases were found to be localized on phagosomes isolated at different time points during maturation of phagosomes to phagolysosomes (24Desjardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 28Pizon V. Desjardins M. Bucci C. Parton R.G. Zerial M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1661-1670PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether PorB modifies intracellular processing of the phagosome, we reconstituted the process of gonococcal phagocytosis with latex beads after treatment of primary human macrophages with purified PorB. Latex bead phagosomes (LPs) were recovered from cells at various time points, and their protein composition and the distribution of cellular markers were analyzed. These were compared with phagosomes formed in the absence of PorB. Significant differences in the phagosomal protein composition were found. Furthermore, we detected higher amounts of annexin II and early endocytic markers and decreased levels of late endocytic markers in phagosomes obtained in the presence of porin compared with those obtained in its absence. These data show that association of PorB with the plasma membrane and LPs modifies the phagosomal processing. Monocytes were isolated from “buffy coat” blood of healthy human blood donors by density gradient centrifugation over Ficoll-Isopaque (Biochrom KG Seromed, Berlin, Germany). Buffy coat blood bags (8–10 bags/experiment, 50–120 ml/bag; obtained from the Blood Transfusion Section of the University Clinic in Tübingen, Germany) were diluted in PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+(PBS−), layered over Ficoll, and centrifuged (277 ×g, 25 °C, 30 min). The mononuclear cells at the interfaces between the plasma and Ficoll were collected and washed twice with PBS−. The pellets of different buffy coat blood fractions were resuspended together in 40 ml of McCoy's medium supplemented with 20% human AB serum (29Hanifin J.M. Cline M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1970; 46: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and monocytes were allowed to adhere to tissue culture Petri dishes for 2–3 h. Non-adherent cells (lymphocytes) were washed with PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ (PBS+), and the remaining adherent cells (predominantly monocytes) were supplemented with new fresh medium containing 20% human AB serum. During the next 3–5 days, the medium was changed daily. Macrophages started to arise on the third or fourth day of cultivation. Macrophage maturation was judged morphologically using phase-contrast microscopy according to criteria adopted by Hanifin and Cline (29Hanifin J.M. Cline M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1970; 46: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Porin was purified from the disseminatingN. gonorrhoeae isolate VP1, producing a PorBIA type of porin, and reconstituted in detergent as described previously (15Rudel T. Schmid A. Benz R. Kolb H.-L. Lang F. Meyer T.F. Cell. 1996; 85: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Purity of purified porin was checked by SDS-PAGE. To isolate PorB+ and PorB− LPs (referred to here as LP+ and LP−), one batch of macrophages was prepared as described above. One-half of the recovered cells was treated with 6 μg/ml PorB for 5 min, whereas the other half was treated with the same buffer excluding porin. Latex beads (0.8-μm diameter, 10% suspension, blue-dyed; Sigma) were then added to the cells at a dilution of 1:100 in McCoy's medium supplemented with 20% human AB serum. After a 55-min pulse (internalization), the cells were washed and homogenized (0 chase) or washed, warmed to 37 °C, and incubated (chased) for 1.5 and 7 h before homogenization. LPs were then isolated by centrifugation on a discontinuous sucrose gradient as described by Desjardins et al. (24Desjardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Human macrophages and isolated LPs were fixed in 2.5% cacodylate-buffered glutaraldehyde (pH 7.2) containing 5 mm CaCl2 for 1 h, washed with cacodylate buffer, embedded in 2% agar, and post-fixed in the same fixative. After washing, agar blocks containing the pellets of cells or phagosomes were immersed in 1% OsO4, dehydrated stepwise in ethanol (50–100%), and embedded in Durcupan (Fluka). Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with a Zeiss EM109 electron microscope. Macrophages were incubated for 5 min with purified PorB at a concentration of 6 μg/ml in McCoy's medium plus 20% human AB serum. The cells were then washed three times with PBS+, scraped with a rubber policeman, and washed three times by centrifugation (277 × g) with 3% bovine serum albumin-containing PBS− to dissociate any nonspecific interaction between PorB and the plasma membrane. Total integral proteins from the plasma membrane were first extracted by Triton X-114 (30Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and precipitated by methanol/chloroform (31Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar). LPs were isolated in the presence and absence of porin as described above. All samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and analyzed by Western blotting using the PorBIA-specific monoclonal antibody (9Weel J.F.L. Hopman C.T.P. van Putten J.P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Proteins from the same number of LP+ and LP− (100 × 106, estimated using a counting chamber with a 10× objective lens and correction of the phase-contrast disc that illuminates the blue-dyed beads on a dark background) isolated at two time points (55-min pulse + 0-min chase and 55-min pulse + 7-h chase) were separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and checked for association of cellular markers with the appropriate primary antibodies, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:3000) or goat anti-mouse IgG (1:5000). Blots were developed by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Different cellular markers were analyzed using affinity-purified anti-Rab4, anti-Rab5, and anti-Rab7 antibodies prepared as described by Zerial et al. (32Zerial M. Parton R. Chavrier P. Frank R. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 398-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); a rabbit polyclonal anti-cathepsin D antibody (a kind gift of Dr. K. Figura, Institut für Biochemie II, Göttingen, Germany); a monoclonal antibody against the C-terminal end of the HLA-DR-α chain (a generous gift of Dr. J. Trowsdale, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, United Kingdom); and monoclonal antibodies against the transferrin receptor (TfR) and annexin II purchased from Calbiochem and Transduction Laboratories, respectively. Flow cytometry was employed as an alternative method to check for association of Rab4 with LP+ and LP−. Analysis of single organelles after disruption of cells using flow cytometry is now known as single organelle fluorescence analysis (for review, see Ref. 33Böck G. Stenlein P. Huber L.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 499-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Single organelle fluorescence analysis was performed as follows. LP fractions (2 × 106 phagosomes/fraction) were incubated for 30 min on ice with the above-described rabbit polyclonal anti-Rab4 antibody at a final concentration of 7 μg/ml. Rabbit IgG (7 μg/ml; Sigma) was used as a negative control. The LPs were then incubated for 30 min on ice with goat anti-rabbit Ig conjugated with phycoerythrin (Dianova) as a second antibody at a dilution of 1:100. LP+and LP− were separated from the rest of the solution by floating on a sucrose step gradient (62, 40, 35, 25, and 10%). The gradients were centrifuged using a Beckman TL-100 centrifuge at 4 °C in a Beckman TLS-55 swinging bucket rotor for 10 min at 35,000 rpm. The LP bands were collected from the interface between the 10 and 25% sucrose concentrations and analyzed using a FACS Vantage (Becton Dickinson) equipped with a Coherent Enterprise laser turned to 120 milliwatts of output at 488 nm. Fluorescence was measured using a 575 ± 26-nm filter. Phagosomes (2 × 104) of each sample were analyzed. The same numbers of LP+and LP− isolated at 0, 1.5, and 7 h after phagocytosis were solubilized in lysis buffer, and the proteins were separated on the basis of their molecular properties in each dimension as described by Bjellqvist et al. (34Bjellqvist B. Pasquali C. Ravier F. Sanchez J.-C. Hochstrasser D.F. Electrophoresis. 1993; 14: 1357-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). In the first dimension, nonlinear immobilized pH gradient strips ranging from pH 4 to 9 were used, and the running conditions were as described previously (35Pasquali C. Fialka I. Huber L.A. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2573-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In the second dimension, SDS-PAGE was performed with 1.5-mm thick gradient gels (9–16%). Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels were stained with ammoniacal silver (36Hochstrasser D.F. Patchornik A. Merril C.R. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 173: 424-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) and scanned using a laser densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) connected to a workshop station power point (Macintosh). The amount of a polypeptide spot was estimated by the relative volume and the relative density in the two-dimensional gel images using Melanie II analysis software (Bio-Rad). The two parameters reflect the amount of each spot in LP+ and LP− polypeptide patterns computed after correction of the differences in gel staining. Maturation of macrophages from primary human monocytes isolated from buffy coat blood required only the addition of serum factors provided by the human AB serum. No antibiotics were needed to obtain contamination-free cultures. In each experiment, cells from 8–10 bags of buffy coat blood were necessary to prepare several hundreds of millions of LP+ and LP− at a certain time point. Three to five days after monocyte adhesion, monolayers of macrophages were obtained (Fig.1 A). Macrophages obtained by this method showed a high potential in internalizing latex beads, as determined by TEM (Fig. 1 B). LPs isolated as described above were surrounded by a continuous and distinct membrane (Fig.1 C) similar to that seen in an intact cell (Fig.1 D). Morphological investigation by TEM of different LP+ and LP− fractions showed that these fractions were devoid of contamination by other organelles (Fig.1 C). Since morphological investigation may not reveal contamination with fragments of broken organelles, we used high resolution two-dimensional PAGE to detect protein markers of unrelated organelles in our fractions. The presence or absence of these protein markers was revealed by matching with the image of the two-dimensional gel of human liver available in the SWISS-2DPAGE Program data base. 3http://expasy.hcuge.ch/ch2d/ch2d-top.html. The following markers were investigated: cytochrome c oxidase for mitochondria; vesicular integral membrane protein (VP36) for the Golgi complex; and protein-disulfide isomerase, calreticulin, and immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein (BiP) for the endoplasmic reticulum. This approach revealed the presence of traces of the tested mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticular markers and the absence of the Golgi marker (data not shown), consistent with the results of Desjardins et al. (23Desjardins M. Celis J.E. van Meer G. Dieplinger H. Jahraus A. Griffiths G. Huber L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32194-32200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who characterized LPs isolated from human myeloid leukemia U937 cells. In contrast to phagosomal proteins, these unrelated markers were not enriched in our LP fractions and were equally distributed in LP+ compared with LP−(data not shown). The isolated porin used in this study was highly pure. As previously shown (15Rudel T. Schmid A. Benz R. Kolb H.-L. Lang F. Meyer T.F. Cell. 1996; 85: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), an additional band became visible in some preparations of native trimeric porin after boiling (Fig.2 A, lane 2). This additional band represents the outer membrane protein P.III, which appears to be complexed with PorB. In our experiments, we used porin preparations devoid of this additional P.III and other proteins and with a low content of lipopolysaccharide (e.g. Fig.2 A, lanes 3–8). Association of purified PorB with the plasma membrane of human macrophages of the culture system and with LPs isolated from these cells was examined by Western blotting using a PorBIAtype-specific monoclonal antibody. Integral proteins isolated from membranes of cells treated with PorB contained a protein that reacted with the antibody (Fig. 2 B, lane 3), whereas the integral proteins from cells treated with the buffer did not (lane 4). Similarly, LPs isolated from cells treated with PorB (LP+) contained a reacting protein (Fig.2 B, lane 5), whereas LP− did not (lane 6). Whole macrophages incubated with the buffer as well as the last wash collected after incubation of the cells with PorB contained no protein detectable with the antibody (Fig. 2 B,lanes 2 and 7, respectively), whereas cells incubated with PorB and collected in the last pellet contained a protein that reacted with the antibody (lane 1). To address the question of whether PorB affects the maturation process of LPs, the association of cellular markers that have been localized to endosomes and phagosomes, such as Rab4, Rab5, Rab7, annexin II, cathepsin D, TfR, and HLA-DR, was analyzed. The association of these markers was followed up in LP+ and LP− isolated at two time points (55-min pulse + 0-min chase and 55-min pulse + 7-h chase). At each time point, an equal number of phagosomes from LP+ and LP− were resolved by one-dimensional gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blotting using specific antibodies. All markers, except Rab4, were detected on both LP+ and LP− using this technique; however, significant differences in the association pattern of some markers were revealed (Fig. 3). At 0 chase, the amount of annexin II and TfR present in LP+clearly exceeded that of LP−, in contrast to cathepsin D, which was reduced in LP+ (Fig. 3). After 7 h, the difference in the amount of these proteins in LP+ and LP− decreased to a minimum (Fig. 3). HLA-DR associated equally with LP+ and LP− at the two time points tested (Fig. 3). Marked differences in the amounts of Rab5 and Rab7 associated with LP+ and LP− were revealed. The amount of Rab5 was significantly higher in LP+ compared with LP− at 0 chase and decreased at a higher rate in LP− compared with LP+after 7 h (Fig. 3). Rab7 showed a pattern opposite to that of Rab5 at 0 chase (Fig. 3). After 7 h, Rab7 was equally enriched in LP+ and LP− (Fig. 3). Using Western blotting, we failed to detect Rab4 in LPs (consistent with the results of Desjardins et al. (24Desjardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) and Via et al. (37Via L.A. Deretic D. Ulmer R.J. Hibler N.S. Huber L.A. Deretic V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13326-13331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), who used the same technique); therefore, we further investigated its association with LP+ and LP− by flow cytometry (single organelle fluorescence analysis). Using this technique, we were able to detect a differential association of this small GTPase with LP+ and LP− early after internalization (Fig.4). The amount of protein associated with LP+ isolated at 0 chase was markedly higher in comparison with that associated with LP−, and 7 h after incubation, Rab4 was no longer detectable in both phagosome fractions (LP+ and LP−) (Fig. 4). Next we asked whether the differences in the rate of acquisition and loss of the regulatory small GTPases in LP+ and LP− were accompanied by differences in the protein composition of phagosomes. The same numbers of LP+ and LP− isolated at 0, 1.5, and 7 h after phagocytosis were separated by two-dimensional PAGE. The gels of a set of LP+ and LP− isolated at the same time point showed distinct patterns, and these patterns changed over time. Although the intensities of a large number of protein spots remained constant, the amounts of several other proteins either decreased or increased with time (data not shown). Comparison between the images of two counterpart silver-stained gels of LP+ and LP− isolated at a given time point revealed significant differences in the association of many proteins with LP+compared with LP−. The counterpart spots that differed by at least 4-fold in their amount, as estimated by densitometry (see “Experimental Procedures”), are presented in Fig.5 (A and B). In an attempt to identify the proteins that were present in different amounts in LP+ compared with LP−, images of two-dimensional gels loaded with LP+ and LP−isolated at 0, 1.5, and 7 h after internalization were compared with images of master two-dimensional gels of human macrophage-like U937 cells, human lymphoma cells, and human liver. These master gels are available in the SWISS-2DPAGE Program data base.3 By matching with the SWISS-2DPAGE data base, spots 1 and 2 (Fig.5 B) were identified as the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin D heavy chain. Using a polyclonal anti-cathepsin D antibody, spot 2 was confirmed by immunoblotting after separation of the proteins of the entire human macrophage by two-dimensional PAGE (data not shown). The antibody did not react with spot 1. The other unknown spots are candidates for protein identification, and mass spectrometry is a feasible approach. At later time points (1.5 and 7 h), the amount of cathepsin D in LP+ and LP− was found to be equal (data not shown), similar to our finding in Western blotting at 7 h after internalization. Previous reports demonstrated that insertion of neisserial porins into eukaryotic cells selectively affects several cellular functionsin vitro (11Haines K.A. Yeh L. Blake M.S. Cristello P.

https://openalex.org/W1972225104,"An uncoupling protein was recently discovered in plant mitochondria and demonstrated to function similarly to the uncoupling protein of brown adipose tissue. In this work, green tomato fruit mitochondria were purified on a self-generating Percoll gradient in the presence of 0.5% bovine serum albumin to deplete mitochondria of endogenous free fatty acids. The uncoupling protein activity was induced by the addition of linoleic acid during the resting state, and in the progressively uncoupled state, as well as during phosphorylating respiration in the presence of benzohydroxamic acid, an inhibitor of the alternative oxidase and with succinate (+ rotenone) as oxidizable substrate. Linoleic acid strongly stimulated the resting respiration in fatty acid-depleted mitochondria but had no effect on phosphorylating respiration, suggesting no activity of the uncoupling protein in this respiratory state. Progressive uncoupling of state 4 respiration decreased the stimulation by linoleic acid. The similar respiratory rates in phosphorylating and fully uncoupled respiration in the presence and absence of linoleic acid suggested that a rate-limiting step on the dehydrogenase side of the respiratory chain was responsible for the insensitivity of phosphorylating respiration to linoleic acid. Indeed, the ADP/O ratio determined by ADP/O pulse method was decreased by linoleic acid, indicating that uncoupling protein was active during phosphorylating respiration and was able to divert energy from oxidative phosphorylation. Moreover, the respiration rates appeared to be determined by membrane potential independently of the presence of linoleic acid, indicating that linoleic acid-induced stimulation of respiration is due to a pure protonophoric activity without any direct effect on the electron transport chain.

Rep. 1997; 17: 319-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar); and a proton electrochemical potential dissipating system, the plant uncoupling mitochondrial protein (PUMP) (8Vercesi A.E. Martins I.S. Silva M.A.P. Leite H.M.F. Cuccovia I.M. Chaimovich H. Nature. 1995; 375: 24Crossref Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 9Vercesi A.E. Chaimovich H. Cuccovia I.M. Recent Res. Dev. Plant Physiol. 1997; 1: 85-91Google Scholar). PUMP functions similarly to the uncoupling protein of mammalian brown adipose tissue which exports anionic free fatty acids (FFA) from the mitochondria, which can subsequently return in a protonated form across the membrane phospholipid bilayer through a “flip-flop” mechanism (10Skulachev V.P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Because for each cycle of FFA transport one H+remains in the matrix (11Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modriansky M. Vassanelli S. Jezek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2615-2620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), there is an increase in proton conductance through the mitochondrial inner membrane, thereby decreasing ΔμH+ and energy availability for energy-consuming processes. AOX catalyzes quinol-oxygen oxyreduction that is not linked to proton pumping outside the matrix. As a result, no ΔμH+ is built and redox free energy is not conserved. AOX is not sensitive to cytochrome pathway inhibitors such as cyanide, antimycin, or myxothiazol but is inhibited by hydroxamic acids such benzohydroxamate (BHAM). Both the PUMP and AOX activities dissipate free energy into heat at the expense of a H+ gradient potential and of a redox potential, respectively, thereby potentially decreasing the yield of ATP production.The two energy-dissipating systems could play a role in thermogenesis, as is obvious for AOX activity in plant thermogenetic tissues (spadices of Araceae) which leads to temperature rise involved in reproductive processes (12Meese B.J.D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1975; 26: 117-126Crossref Google Scholar). An increase in temperature is also observed during the ripening of climacteric fruits and is attributed to the stimulation of AOX activity (13Day D.A. Arron G.P. Laties G.G. Davies D.D. Biochemistry of Plants. 2. Academic Press, Inc., New York1980: 197-241Google Scholar, 14Cruz-Hernández A. Gómez-Lim M.A. Planta. 1995; 197: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, in nonthermogenic tissues or cells, PUMP and AOX must play a more fundamental role at the level of energy balance of the cell. Indeed, the supply of reducing substrates and the energy and carbon demand for biosynthesis are coupled by respiration. Metabolic conditions that lead to a high reducing power or a high phosphate potential reflect an imbalance between the supply and demand processes and result in a decrease in electron flux through the cytochrome pathway. The modification of AOX activity, which is not controlled by the energy status of the cell and is finely tuned (allosteric and redox status of the protein and expression) (6Vanlerberghe G.C. McIntosh L. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 703-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), could counteract these imbalances. On the other hand, PUMP control through allosteric inhibition by purine nucleotides and the FFA availability is well recognized (9Vercesi A.E. Chaimovich H. Cuccovia I.M. Recent Res. Dev. Plant Physiol. 1997; 1: 85-91Google Scholar). The uniport of FFA (e.g. linoleic acid, LA) through PUMP is driven by the mitochondrial transmembrane electrical potential (ΔΨ). Therefore, PUMP activity could also counteract the imbalances described above mainly by decreasing ΔΨ. The possible connection between the regulation of the AOX and PUMP energy-dissipating systems and their possible complementarity could be of utmost importance for the organelle oxidative phosphorylation efficiency and for the energy status of the cell.In this work, we have used FFA-depleted mitochondria of green mature tomato fruits, Lycopersicon esculentum, a climacteric fruit known to express the PUMP and AOX 2A.

Sluse, unpublished data. proteins. We have investigated whether LA-induced stimulation of respiration reflects pure uncoupling and whether LA-induced PUMP activity is able to divert energy from oxidative phosphorylation, i.e. if PUMP is actually active during state 3 respiration.DISCUSSIONThe demonstration by Garlid et al. (11Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modriansky M. Vassanelli S. Jezek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2615-2620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) that anionic fatty acids are the transported substrates of uncoupling protein and that this electrophoretic efflux of univalent amphiphilic anions coupled with a fast return of protonated fatty acids across the phospholipid bilayer results in mitochondrial uncoupling has provided the mechanistic basis for understanding of the carrier-mediated uncoupling by the H+ circuit through uncoupling protein. Such fatty acid cycling can increase the mitochondrial respiration in the absence of energy-requiring processes. Since PUMP possesses transport properties similar to those of the uncoupling protein of brown adipose tissue mitochondria, linoleic acid, a naturally abundant plant FFA, strongly activates the H+ transport and induces a membrane potential drop in potato tuber mitochondria respiring with succinate in state 4 (19Ježek P. Costa A.D.T. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32743-32748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The dependence of FFA-induced H+transport on ΔΨ has been documented in proteoliposomes containing PUMP in which there is an exponential increase in H+transport with increasing applied voltage (K+ diffusion potential) (20Ježek P. Costa A.D.T. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24272-24278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).We have shown here that the addition of 10 μm LA to FFA-depleted green tomato mitochondria in the resting state (+ olig, + BHAM) stimulated respiration (+172%) and caused a drop of 25 mV (−12.5%) in the ΔΨ (Fig. 1). This increase in respiration linked to PUMP activation by 10 μm LA (2.7×) is comparable to the increase in 10 μm LA-induced H+ transport detected by passive osmotic swelling in the presence of 2 mm Mg2+ in potato tuber mitochondria and is close to the half-maximum effect of LA in these mitochondria (19Ježek P. Costa A.D.T. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32743-32748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).At concentrations above 40 μm, LA by itself caused swelling of potato tuber mitochondria in suspension containing 0.2 mg of protein/ml of incubation medium (19Ježek P. Costa A.D.T. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32743-32748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Respiratory experiments in green tomato mitochondria showed that already 20 μm LA decreased both state 3 and LA-induced state 4 respiration with 0.3 mg of protein mitochondrial/ml of incubation medium (data not shown). It seems that the concentration of LA causing a half-maximum effect on respiration in intact mitochondria was much lower than the apparentK m determined in reconstituted systems (83 μm) (20Ježek P. Costa A.D.T. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24272-24278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In tomato mitochondria, the small drop in ΔΨ (from 200 mV to 175 mV) (Fig. 1) caused by 10 μmLA in state 4 respiration, with both ATPase and AOX activities blocked, resulted in a respiration rate equal to 80% of the fully uncoupled state with FCCP. This drop in ΔΨ cannot be compared with membrane potential changes during LA-induced uncoupling of potato tuber mitochondria respiring with succinate since the latter were not quantified (19Ježek P. Costa A.D.T. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32743-32748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).A striking observation was the absence of LA stimulation of state 3 respiration (Fig. 2). The presence of ADP was not responsible for the lack of LA-induced respiration since stimulation by LA was also seen when state 3 was inhibited by olig (Fig. 2). State 3 respiration (±10 μm LA) was found to be equal to state 4 + 0.7 μm FCCP (±10 μm LA) and to state 3 + 0.7 μm FCCP (Fig. 2). This suggests that the respiratory chain was saturated (i.e. working at maximal rate), with the limiting step likely being the succinate dehydrogenase (complex II). Such a situation would not permit LA-induced acceleration of state 3 respiration. This does not mean that PUMP activity was not induced in state 3 respiration. Indeed, maximal electron flux in respiratory chain building ΔμH+, which is used for ATP synthesis in the absence of LA, could be shared between oxidative phosphorylation and PUMP activity in the presence of LA. Measurements of ADP/O ratio have been used successfully to determine the contribution of a dissipating pathway (AOX) in amoeba mitochondria during state 3 respiration (21Jarmuszkiewicz W. Sluse-Goffart C.M. Hryniewiecka L. Michejda J. Sluse F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10174-10180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This approach could provide information about a possible participation of PUMP in state 3 respiration in green tomato mitochondria. The LA concentration-dependent decrease in the ADP/O ratio in the presence of BHAM (Table 1) clearly indicates a significant participation of PUMP activity in phosphorylating respiration leading to a strong decrease in the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation: −18 and −44% at 3.9 and 8 μm LA, respectively.ADP/O ratios have been used to estimate the contribution of PUMP activity (i.e. that part of the cytochrome pathway activity, Vcyt diss, that is finally dissipated into heat) at a given state 3 respiration rate, and to assess the contribution of ATP synthase activity (i.e. part of the cytochrome pathway activity, Vcyt cons, that is finally conserved into ATP) at the above two LA concentrations. Thus, Vcyt cons=V3×(ADP/O)+LA(ADP/O)−LAEquation 1 is the conserving part sustained by ATP synthesis, and Vcyt diss=V3−Vcyt consEquation 2 is the dissipating part sustained by PUMP activity. Therefore, if V3 is 500 nmol of oxygen atom/min/mg of protein, Vcyt cons are 412 and 282 nmol of oxygen atom/min/mg of protein, and Vcyt diss are 88 and 218 nmol of oxygen atom/min/mg of protein at 3.9 and 8 μm LA, respectively. These calculations are valid only if several requirements (currently under study) are fulfilled. Nevertheless, the above calculations already show how effective PUMP activity is on energy dissipation and how small variations in the cellular FFA concentration can have a significant influence on oxidative phosphorylation.A single force-flow relationship has been observed for state 4, state 4+olig, state 4+ LA, and state 3± LA (Fig. 3) with succinate (+ rotenone) as oxidizable substrate. This means that modulation of the force (ΔΨ) either by phosphorylation potential or by LA addition leads to the same modification of the flow (respiratory rate). Thus, it can be concluded that the presence of LA gives rise to a proton recycling only, as proposed by Garlid et al. (11Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modriansky M. Vassanelli S. Jezek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2615-2620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), and does not interact with the electron transport system in purified tomato fruit mitochondria depleted of endogenous FFA.In conclusion, we have demonstrated that LA-induced stimulation of respiration is a pure protonophoric effect and that PUMP activity can efficiently divert energy from oxidative phosphorylation in state 3. Since the advent of Mitchell's chemiosmotic theory for energy conservation in 1961 (1Mitchell P. Nature. 1961; 191: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2882) Google Scholar), it has been recognized that the proton electrochemical gradient (ΔμH+) 1The abbreviations used are: ΔμH+, proton electrochemical gradient; AOX, alternative oxidase; PUMP, plant uncoupling mitochondrial protein; FFA, free fatty acids; BHAM, benzohydroxamic acid; LA, linoleic acid; ΔΨ, mitochondrial transmembrane electrical potential; BSA, bovine serum albumin; TPP+, tetraphenyl phosphonium; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; olig, oligomycin; V, respiratory rate; V4, state 4 respiration; V3, state 3 respiration. 1The abbreviations used are: ΔμH+, proton electrochemical gradient; AOX, alternative oxidase; PUMP, plant uncoupling mitochondrial protein; FFA, free fatty acids; BHAM, benzohydroxamic acid; LA, linoleic acid; ΔΨ, mitochondrial transmembrane electrical potential; BSA, bovine serum albumin; TPP+, tetraphenyl phosphonium; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; olig, oligomycin; V, respiratory rate; V4, state 4 respiration; V3, state 3 respiration.generated across the inner mitochondrial membrane by the respiratory chain is used not only to phosphorylate ADP but also to support other processes such as the transport of inorganic cations (2Vercesi A.E.

Energy dissipation in plant mitochondria can be mediated by two processes: a redox potential dissipating system, the quinol alternative oxidase (AOX) branched from the main respiratory chain at the level of ubiquinone (6Vanlerberghe G.C.

It seems that the concentration of LA causing a half-maximum effect on respiration in intact mitochondria was much lower than the apparentK m determined in reconstituted systems (83 μm) (20Ježek P. Costa A.D.T. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24272-24278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In tomato mitochondria, the small drop in ΔΨ (from 200 mV to 175 mV) (Fig. 1) caused by 10 μmLA in state 4 respiration, with both ATPase and AOX activities blocked, resulted in a respiration rate equal to 80% of the fully uncoupled state with FCCP. This drop in ΔΨ cannot be compared with membrane potential changes during LA-induced uncoupling of potato tuber mitochondria respiring with succinate since the latter were not quantified (19Ježek P. Costa A.D.T. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32743-32748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A striking observation was the absence of LA stimulation of state 3 respiration (Fig. 2). The presence of ADP was not responsible for the lack of LA-induced respiration since stimulation by LA was also seen when state 3 was inhibited by olig (Fig. 2). State 3 respiration (±10 μm LA) was found to be equal to state 4 + 0.7 μm FCCP (±10 μm LA) and to state 3 + 0.7 μm FCCP (Fig. 2). This suggests that the respiratory chain was saturated (i.e. working at maximal rate), with the limiting step likely being the succinate dehydrogenase (complex II). Such a situation would not permit LA-induced acceleration of state 3 respiration. This does not mean that PUMP activity was not induced in state 3 respiration. Indeed, maximal electron flux in respiratory chain building ΔμH+, which is used for ATP synthesis in the absence of LA, could be shared between oxidative phosphorylation and PUMP activity in the presence of LA. Measurements of ADP/O ratio have been used successfully to determine the contribution of a dissipating pathway (AOX) in amoeba mitochondria during state 3 respiration (21Jarmuszkiewicz W. Sluse-Goffart C.M. Hryniewiecka L. Michejda J. Sluse F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10174-10180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This approach could provide information about a possible participation of PUMP in state 3 respiration in green tomato mitochondria. The LA concentration-dependent decrease in the ADP/O ratio in the presence of BHAM (Table 1) clearly indicates a significant participation of PUMP activity in phosphorylating respiration leading to a strong decrease in the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation: −18 and −44% at 3.9 and 8 μm LA, respectively. ADP/O ratios have been used to estimate the contribution of PUMP activity (i.e. that part of the cytochrome pathway activity, Vcyt diss, that is finally dissipated into heat) at a given state 3 respiration rate, and to assess the contribution of ATP synthase activity (i.e. part of the cytochrome pathway activity, Vcyt cons, that is finally conserved into ATP) at the above two LA concentrations. Thus, Vcyt cons=V3×(ADP/O)+LA(ADP/O)−LAEquation 1 is the conserving part sustained by ATP synthesis, and Vcyt diss=V3−Vcyt consEquation 2 is the dissipating part sustained by PUMP activity. Therefore, if V3 is 500 nmol of oxygen atom/min/mg of protein, Vcyt cons are 412 and 282 nmol of oxygen atom/min/mg of protein, and Vcyt diss are 88 and 218 nmol of oxygen atom/min/mg of protein at 3.9 and 8 μm LA, respectively. These calculations are valid only if several requirements (currently under study) are fulfilled. Nevertheless, the above calculations already show how effective PUMP activity is on energy dissipation and how small variations in the cellular FFA concentration can have a significant influence on oxidative phosphorylation. A single force-flow relationship has been observed for state 4, state 4+olig, state 4+ LA, and state 3± LA (Fig. 3) with succinate (+ rotenone) as oxidizable substrate. This means that modulation of the force (ΔΨ) either by phosphorylation potential or by LA addition leads to the same modification of the flow (respiratory rate). Thus, it can be concluded that the presence of LA gives rise to a proton recycling only, as proposed by Garlid et al. (11Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modriansky M. Vassanelli S. Jezek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2615-2620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), and does not interact with the electron transport system in purified tomato fruit mitochondria depleted of endogenous FFA. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that LA-induced stimulation of respiration is a pure protonophoric effect and that PUMP activity can efficiently divert energy from oxidative phosphorylation in state 3.

The syndecan cytoplasmic domains contain four conserved tyrosine residues, two of which are located within favorable sequences for phosphorylation. Endogenous tyrosine phosphorylation of syndecans-1 and -4 is detected in adherent B82 fibroblasts.

Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2683-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). These interactions suggest a role for the syndecans in transducing signals from the extracellular environment to the cell interior. Protein phosphorylation plays a critical role in a variety of cellular processes, including the generation of intracellular signals in response to external stimuli (12Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar). The syndecans do not display intrinsic enzymatic activity; however, they are postulated to assemble protein complexes at the plasma membrane that contain structural and/or signaling proteins capable of initiating downstream signals (13Grunwald G.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 14Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2811) Google Scholar). The best characterized example of adhesion receptors that function in this manner are the integrins, which initiate the assembly of focal adhesions in response to cell adhesion to extracellular matrix (14Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2811) Google Scholar). These specialized sites of adhesion contain structural proteins such as talin, vinculin, and paxillin, and a variety of kinases such as FAK, Src, and protein kinase C. Integrin engagement results in enhanced kinase activity, phosphorylation of numerous focal adhesion components, the recruitment of proteins containing SH2 domains, and the activation of downstream signaling pathways resulting in changes in gene expression, cell cycle progression, and cell morphology (15Cobb B.S. Schaller M.D. Leu T.H. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 16Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). Cell surface proteoglycans have been implicated in initiating downstream signaling events in response to cell adhesion to extracellular matrix. Engagement of the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan NG2 is required along with α4β1 integrin to initiate cell spreading and focal adhesion formation in melanoma cells (17Iida J. Meijne A.M. Spiro R.C. Roos E. Furcht L.T. McCarthy J.B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2177-2185PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, fibroblast spreading and focal adhesion formation in response to fibronectin requires the engagement of both integrins and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (18Woods A. Couchman J.R. Johansson S. Hook M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 19Woods A. McCarthy J.B. Furcht L.T. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In this system, engagement of proteoglycans can be replaced by activation of protein kinase C (20Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 277-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Syndecan-4 has been shown to localize to focal adhesions containing β1 or β3 integrins (21Woods A. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-3 binds a protein complex containing c-Src and Fyn, along with the cytoskeleton associated proteins cortactin and tubulin, and ligation of syndecan-3 results in the phosphorylation of c-Src and cortactin (24Kinnunen T.

In contrast to their extracellular domains, the cytoplasmic domains of the syndecans are highly conserved (4Rapraeger A.C. Ott V.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 620-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This domain contains two regions that are 100% conserved among all vertebrate syndecans (Fig.1). One is a conserved juxtamembrane region consisting of 11 amino acids (YRMR/KKKDEGSY), and the second (EFYA) is located at the extreme carboxyl terminus of the cytoplasmic domain, and has recently been shown to bind to the PDZ domains of syntenin (25Grootjans J.J.

Weinberg R.J. Sheng M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The syndecan cytoplasmic domains also contain four conserved tyrosine residues, two of which are in favorable sequences for phosphorylation (28Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 342-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 29Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 477-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of syndecan-3 has been demonstrated in vitro (30Asundi V.K. Carey D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate the endogenous tyrosine phosphorylation of syndecans-1 and -4, but not syndecan-2, in B82 fibroblasts. Phosphorylation is tightly regulated and is not readily detected in other cell types tested except following treatment with tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors. This is consistent with our previous report of syndecan-1 phosphorylation in mammary epithelial (NMuMG) cells in response to pervanadate (31Reiland J. Ott V.L. Lebakken C.S. Yeaman C. McCarthy J. Rapraeger A.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and demonstrates that syndecan phosphorylation is regulated differently depending on cell type. Using a variety of kinase inhibitors, Src family kinases are implicated in regulating the tyrosine phosphorylation of both syndecan-1 and -4; although data also suggest that the two proteins may be phosphorylated on different tyrosine residues. This work suggests an important function for tyrosine phosphorylation of the syndecans, which may vary in different cell types and among the different syndecan family members. B82 fibroblasts were obtained from Dr. Paul Bertics (University of Wisconsin-Madison) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories), 4 mml-glutamine (Sigma), and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). L-M(TK)−and L929 fibroblasts were obtained from Dr. James Nelson (Stanford University) and Dr. Curtis Brandt (University of Wisconsin-Madison), respectively, and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum (HyClone Laboratories),l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Syndecan-1 expressing human Raji lymphoblastoid (Raji-S1) cells were grown as described previously (32Lebakken C.S. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1209-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% calf serum, l-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and hygromycin-B (300 μg/ml) (Boehringer-Mannheim). Low passage NMuMG normal mammary epithelial cells were grown as described previously (33David G. Bernfield M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sodium orthovanadate, hydrogen peroxide, staurosporine, and genistein were purchased from Sigma. Herbimycin A was purchased from Calbiochem. Stock solutions of genistein (10 mg/ml), herbimycin A (1 mg/ml), and staurosporine (1 mm) were prepared in Me2SO or methanol and diluted to the indicated concentrations in cell culture medium. Inhibitors were incubated with cells at 37 °C for the indicated lengths of time. Control samples were treated with matching concentrations of vehicle, and in all cases showed no significant effect on syndecan phosphorylation. Cells were washed with ice-cold TES (20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 165 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) and incubated with 20 μg/ml l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma) in TES on ice for 10 min. Cells were washed with PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and residual trypsin was inactivated with 118 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). Cells were washed with biotinylation buffer (10 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2) and 0.2 mg/ml EZ-LinkTMSulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) in biotinylation buffer was added to the cells for 30 min at 4 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 m glycine to a final concentration of 40 mm. Antibodies used to isolate syndecans include: (a) an affinity-purified pan-syndecan antibody generated in rabbits against the carboxyl-terminal 10 amino acids of syndecan-1 (31Reiland J. Ott V.L.

Cells (3–5 × 106/ml) were lysed in extraction buffer (PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin) for 10 min on ice. Insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with either 10 μg/ml pan-syndecan antibody, 20 μl/ml S4CD, 30 μg/ml mAb 2E9 or 6G12, or 10 μg/ml mAb 281.2. Immune complexes were precipitated with 25 μl of protein A-agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.) or protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech), washed with TBS (1 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.15 m NaCl) containing 5 mm EDTA (TBS/EDTA), and extracted in sample buffer. Immune complexes were washed and resuspended in heparitinase buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 6.5), 50 mm NaOAc, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2) and incubated with 2.4 × 10−3 IU/ml heparitinase (ICN Biochemicals) and 0.1 conventional units/ml chondroitin ABC lyase (ICN Biochemicals) for 4 h at 37 °C; fresh enzymes were added after 2 h. Cells were lysed in extraction buffer and syndecans immunoprecipitated as described above. The precipitates were washed and resuspended in 25 mm MES (pH 6.0) containing 30 units/ml potato acid phosphatase (Calbiochem). Samples were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C, with fresh enzyme addition after each hour. Precipitates were washed again with TBS/EDTA and resuspended in sample buffer. Samples were resolved on a 7.5/15% Laemmli step gel and transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidine difluoride membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore). The membrane was fixed with 0.05% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated in blocking solution (TBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.02% NaN3) for at least 2 h. Tyrosine phosphorylation was detected using a 1:1000 dilution of anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20, Transduction Laboratories) in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20. Blots were washed in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and further incubated with biotin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at 1:5000 in TBST followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at 1:2000 in TBST. Blots were washed twice with alkaline phosphatase buffer (100 mm Tris (pH 9.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2), developed with Vistra ECF reagent (Amersham) and scanned on a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Blots were stripped by treatment with erasing buffer (62.5 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min at 70 °C and re-blocked as described above. Syndecans were detected by immunoblotting with the pan-syndecan antibody. Briefly, blots were incubated with 0.1 μg/ml antibody in Blotto+ (PBS containing 5% non-fat dry milk, 25 μg/ml heparin (Sigma), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.3% Tween 20) for 2 h, washed, and then incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h at 1:10,000 in Blotto+ and developed as described above. Most adherent cells express multiple syndecans at the cell surface. To determine which syndecan family members are expressed in B82 fibroblasts, cell surface proteins were biotinylated and syndecans were immunoprecipitated with a panel of syndecan antibodies specific for the cytoplasmic domains of different syndecan family members (Fig. 2 A). Using a pan-syndecan antibody (Pan) that recognizes the conserved C2 region in the cytoplasmic domains of all the syndecan family members (4Rapraeger A.C. Ott V.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 620-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), three distinct syndecan core proteins migrating at about 75, 48, and 35 kDa are detected following digestion of extracellular GAG chains with heparitinase and chondroitin ABC lyase. In some experiments, the three core proteins appear to migrate as doublets. The reason for this is not clear, but may be the result of incomplete digestion of the heparan sulfate GAG chains. Without enzymatic digestion of the GAG chains, the syndecans migrate in a diffuse, high molecular weight distribution on SDS-PAGE and are difficult to identify by immunostaining. The sizes of the core proteins suggest that they represent syndecans-1, -2, and -4. This is confirmed by detection with specific antibodies. The 75-kDa core protein is identified as syndecan-1 by precipitation with mAb 281.2, which is specific for the mouse syndecan-1 extracellular domain (data not shown). Syndecan-1 is also the predominant core protein isolated by immunoprecipitation with mAb 2E9, although this antibody also precipitates a very minor amount of the 35-kDa protein identified as syndecan-4. The 35-kDa syndecan-4 protein is precipitated with antiserum raised against a syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain peptide (S4CD). In addition, S4CD precipitates a minor amount of syndecan-1. The final antibody used in this study, mAb 6G12, is the only antibody, other than the pan-syndecan antibody, that precipitates the 48-kDa protein which is predicted to be syndecan-2 based on its molecular mass. However, this antibody also precipitates syndecan-4, and, to a lesser extent, syndecan-1. Tyrosine phosphorylation of intact syndecan core proteins is not easily detected. The core proteins remain somewhat diffuse even after digestion of the GAG chains, which makes it extremely difficult to detect the low level of endogenous syndecan phosphorylation that occurs in these cells (see Fig. 6). In the best of cases, endogenous phosphorylation can be detected by immunostaining with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20), as shown for syndecan-1 in Fig. 2 B (left panel), although the detection is very weak. The phosphotyrosine band is confirmed to be syndecan-1 by subsequent immunostaining with the pan-syndecan antibody (data not shown). In this particular assay, no phosphotyrosine was detected on the syndecan-2 and -4 core proteins. To facilitate the detection of syndecan phosphorylation, cells were treated with mild trypsin, which specifically cleaves the syndecan extracellular domains, leaving cell-associated fragments consisting of the syndecan transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (COOH-terminal fragments) (31Reiland J. Ott V.L. Lebakken C.S. Yeaman C. McCarthy J. Rapraeger A.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Because of the extreme sensitivity of the syndecans to trypsin, this cleavage can be conducted rapidly on ice (37Rapraeger A. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4103-4109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the full-length syndecan core proteins, the COOH-terminal fragments migrate as discrete reproducible bands on SDS-PAGE, and tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple COOH-terminal fragments is readily detected (Fig. 3). Four trypsin-generated COOH-terminal fragments migrating between 12 and 18 kDa are precipitated using the pan-syndecan antibody, and are referred to as bands a through d (Fig. 3 A). Without trypsin treatment, the pan-syndecan antibody precipitates smaller COOH-terminal fragments (see Fig. 3 A, no trypsin) that migrate between 8 and 12 kDa. These fragments are generated by endogenous shedding of the syndecan extracellular domains, which is characteristic of the syndecans and has been described previously (38Jalkanen M. Rapraeger A. Saunders S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 3087-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Immunostaining with PY20 demonstrates endogenous tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple COOH-terminal fragments, with the majority of phosphotyrosine detected on bands a and d, and a minor amount on band c (Fig. 3 B). To determine which syndecans are phosphorylated, syndecan COOH-terminal fragments were isolated using the specific syndecan antibodies characterized in Fig. 2, followed by immunostaining with PY20. Syndecan-1 COOH-terminal fragments are precipitated with mAb 2E9 and account for three of the four trypsin-generated fragments (bandsa-c). Immunostaining with PY20 demonstrates that two of the syndecan-1 COOH-terminal fragments (bands a andc) are phosphorylated on tyrosine. The majority of phosphotyrosine is detected in band a, with a minor amount in band c. Band b does not appear phosphorylated. Endogenous tyrosine phosphorylation of syndecan-4 is also detected. A single syndecan-4 COOH-terminal fragment is isolated by immunoprecipitation with S4CD (band d), and subsequent immunostaining with PY20 demonstrates that this fragment is phosphorylated. Together, the two major tyrosine phosphorylated fragments represent syndecan-1 (band a) and syndecan-4 (bandd). To identify the syndecan-2 fragment(s), syndecan COOH-terminal fragments were precipitated with mAb 6G12, which recognizes equal amounts syndecans-2 and -4, and a lesser amount of syndecan-1 (Fig.2 A). Bands c and d are the predominant fragments precipitated with mAb 6G12 and are present in approximately equal amounts. Since band d has been identified as syndecan-4, band c is likely to represent syndecan-2 (Fig.3 A). However, a minor amount of syndecan-1 precipitated with this antibody may also contribute to band c. To confirm that band c represents syndecan-2, cell lysates were depleted of syndecan-1 by multiple rounds of immunoprecipitation with mAb 2E9. Following immunodepletion of syndecan-1, bands c andd are still the predominant fragments precipitated with mAb 6G12, confirming that band c represents syndecan-2 (data not shown). Using mAb 6G12, tyrosine phosphorylation of syndecan-2 (bandc) is not detected, whereas tyrosine phosphorylation of syndecan-4 (band d) is readily observed (Fig.3 B). Tyrosine phosphorylation of syndecans-1 and -4 is also detected in L-M(TK)− and L929 fibroblasts, demonstrating that endogenous phosphorylation of syndecans is not restricted to the B82 cell line (Fig. 4 A). However, B82 cells consistently show the highest level of endogenous phosphorylation and were therefore chosen for further characterization. Treatment of syndecan COOH-terminal fragments with potato acid phosphatase results in the loss of detectable tyrosine phosphorylation, confirming that PY20 immunoreactivity is specific for phosphorylated syndecan (Fig. 4 B, compare lanes 7 and8). Interestingly, band a (syndecan-1) is no longer detected following phosphatase treatment (Fig. 4 B, compare lanes 2 and 3), demonstrating that banda represents a syndecan-1 COOH-terminal fragment that migrates at a higher molecular weight when phosphorylated. This shift in migration may be due to hyperphosphorylation of the syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain, or phosphorylation at a site that alters its migration on SDS-PAGE. Treatment with heat-inactivated potato acid phosphatase does not result in the loss of tyrosine phosphorylation, nor does it affect the migration of band a. Interestingly, a comparison of the phosphorylated syndecan-1 (e.g. banda) to the syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain (e.g.band d) demonstrates that the majority of the syndecan-1 shifts when phosphorylated, while the majority of the syndecan-4 does not (Fig. 3 B). This suggests that syndecans-1 and -4 may be phosphorylated on different residues. As expected, when cells are pretreated with pervanadate, syndecan phosphorylation is dramatically enhanced (Fig. 4 B). Pervanadate treatment also leads to enhanced shedding of syndecans, and tyrosine phosphorylation of the shed fragments is also detected. These results are consistent with previous studies demonstrating the tyrosine phosphorylation and shedding of syndecan-1 following pervanadate treatment (31Reiland J. Ott V.L. Lebakken C.S. Yeaman C. McCarthy J. Rapraeger A.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Syndecan COOH-terminal fragments isolated from B82 cells were further characterized by comparing them to syndecan-1 COOH-terminal fragments isolated from Raji-S1 cells before and after treatment with pervanadate. Raji-S1 cells were generated by transfecting syndecan-1 cDNA into syndecan-negative Raji lymphoblastoid cells as described elsewhere (32Lebakken C.S. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1209-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Treatment with trypsin generates two syndecan-1 COOH-terminal fragments that correspond to bands b andc precipitated from B82 cells (Fig. 4 C, comparelanes 2 and 4). Without trypsin treatment, a single shed fragment is detected that migrates below bandsa-d. Syndecan-4 (band d) is not detected in Raji-S1 cells as expected. In contrast to the endogenous phosphorylation of syndecans seen in B82 cells, syndecan-1 phosphorylation in Raji-S1 cells is only detected following treatment with pervanadate. Furthermore, band a is not endogenously detected in Raji-S1 cells, but appears when syndecan-1 is phosphorylated in response to pervanadate. This is consistent with the results obtained using B82 cells which demonstrates that banda represents a syndecan-1 fragment that migrates at a higher molecular weight only when phosphorylated (Fig. 4 B). Treatment of B82 and mammary epithelial (NMuMG) cells with vanadate over a 3-h time course has different effects on syndecan phosphorylation, demonstrating that phosphorylation is regulated differently in the two cell types (Fig.5). Treatment of B82 cells with vanadate results in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of bandsa–d. Phosphorylation of syndecan-4 (bandd) is enhanced within 15 min but is then diminished. However, at these time points, syndecan-4 protein is no longer detected. This loss of protein is likely the result of vanadate-induced shedding and subsequent internalization or degradation of the protein. In support of this, full-length syndecan-4 core protein is not detected by surface biotinylation in B82 cells following treatment with pervanadate, whereas a significant amount of syndecans-1 and -2"

Mutation of Ikaros or AP-1 binding sites in the context of the granzyme B promoter demonstrated that both sites participate in dexamethasone-mediated inhibition of the granzyme B promoter activity. Electromobility shift assay revealed that dexamethasone abolished the binding of nuclear transcription factors to the Ikaros binding site and reduced AP-1 binding activity.

Graft rejection remains a significant obstacle to successful allogeneic transplantation. Understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for allograft rejection is essential in developing new therapeutic approaches that will lead to successful allogeneic transplantation. The immune effector cells responsible for this clinical syndrome are cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Antigen-triggered T-cell activation induces a variety of molecular transduction signals that lead to the acquisition of a killing potential by these cells. Two major pathways lead to the cell death of target cells by cytotoxic T lymphocyte/granule-mediated exocytosis and the Fas/FasL interaction system. The granule exocytosis pathway is a major apoptotic mechanism used by cytotoxic T lymphocyte and natural killer cells. Upon specific recognition and T-cell activation by foreign antigens present on target cells, cytotoxic T lymphocyte and natural killer cells accumulate granules in their cytoplasm. These granules contain the pore-forming protein perforin, which undergoes calcium-dependent polymerization on the target cell membrane, thereby forming a complement-like lesion (1Podack E. Young J. Cohn Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8629-8633Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) that facilitates delivery of the granule constituents, including granzymes, to the target cell cytoplasm. Delivery of granule component proteins is required for the induction of apoptosis (2Shi L. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. Aebersold R. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp.

Disease states in which T-cell and cytokine-mediated tissue damage predominate, including allograft rejection, autoimmune disease, and many cases of chronic inflammation and delayed hypersensitivity, are effectively treated with glucocorticoids.

In a previous study, we observed that granzyme B expression could be down-regulated at the protein level in graft-infiltrating lymphocytes in heart-transplanted patients with severe and mild rejection under corticoid treatment (32Legros-Maı̈da S.

This effect, which could be reversible, coincided with graft stabilization and preceded the complete disappearance of cellular infiltration (32Legros-Maı̈da S. Soulié A. Benvenuti C. Wargnier A.

In this study we have examined the molecular basis of the previously mentioned down-regulation of lytic protein expression by glucocorticoids. In both humans and mice, the granzyme B gene is not expressed in resting T-cells but is induced at the transcription level 24 to 72 h after T-cell activation (33Caputo A. Fahey D. Lloyd C. Vozab R.

The DNA regulatory element that controls the level of granzyme B gene transcription in activated T-cells resides between nucleotides −148 and + 60 (relative to the transcriptional start point +1) of the human granzyme B gene promoter (35Haddad P.

In this report, we examine the effects of the glucocorticoid hormone dexamethasone on the transcriptional activity and DNA binding pattern of the human granzyme B gene promoter in PHA-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We present evidence that dexamethasone significantly decreases the activation of granzyme B transcription in these PHA-activated cells. The −148 to +60 region of the granzyme B promoter is identified as a target for this suppression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that dexamethasone abolished the binding of nuclear transcription factors to the Ikaros and AP-1 sites of the promoter, whereas CBF binding remained unaffected. We show here for the first time that dexamethasone has an inhibitory effect on the binding of nuclear factors to the Ikaros and AP-1 regulatory elements of the human granzyme B promoter in PHA-activated PBMCs. A buffy coat of human PBMCs was purified by Ficoll-Hypaque density centrifugation. PBMCs were cultured in complete RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% inactivated human serum and activated with PHA at a final concentration of 15 μg/ml, 2 h before the addition of dexamethasone at various concentrations (1 μm, 100 nm, and 10 nm). Total cellular RNA was extracted by immediate solubilization of PBMCs in guanidium isothiocyanate according to the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (39Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis of 10 μg of each RNA through a 1% agarose formaldehyde gel, transfer to a Hybond N nitrocellulose membrane was carried out (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A granzyme B32P-labeled RNA probe was prepared using the sp6 RNA polymerase as described previously (40Clement V. Haddad P. Soulie A. Legros-Maı̈da S. Guillet J. Cesar E. Sasportes M. Res. Immunol. 1990; 141: 477-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Hybridization was carried out with this probe and visualized by autoradiography. To verify equal loading of RNA, the membrane was also hybridized with32P-labeled human β-actin cDNA (CLONTECH). The plasmid PBLCAT3, which contains the CAT gene but no promoter, and the plasmid PBLCAT2, which contains the CAT gene under the control of the thymidine kinase promoter, were kindly provided by G. Schütz, Heidelberg (41Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). The CAT3A construct containing the −148 to +60 human granzyme B promoter has been previously described (35Haddad P. Wargnier A. Bourge J.F. Sasportes M. Paul P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The wild type CAT2A(77) or mutated −148 to −77 granzyme B region CAT2AM1(77), CAT2AM2(77), corresponding to mutations in the Ikaros binding site and the AP-1/CBF binding site, respectively, were inserted upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter in the PBLCAT2 plasmid. These granzyme B promoter fragments were obtained by restriction enzyme digestion or polymerase chain reaction amplification from the CAT3A, CAT3AM1, CAT3AM2 vectors previously described (36Wargnier A. Legros-Maı̈da S. Bosselut R. Bourge J.F. Lafaurie C. Ghysdael J. Sasportes M. Paul P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6930-6934Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The mutations were confirmed by dideoxy-DNA sequencing of the constructs. CAT assays were performed as described (35Haddad P. Wargnier A. Bourge J.F. Sasportes M. Paul P. Eur. J.

After 48 h of culture, 107 cells were transfected by electroporation using the Bio-Rad gene pulser set at 960 microfarads and 250 V with 10 μg of plasmid. CAT activity was determined 24 h later as described (35Haddad P. Wargnier A. Bourge J.F. Sasportes M. Paul P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and quantified by liquid scintillation of spots cut from chromatography plates. The CDM8-Ikaros1 and CDM8-Ikaros2 and simian virus c-Jun expression vectors were kindly provided by Dr. K. Georgopoulos (Boston, MA) and Dr. J. M. Blanchard (Montpellier, France), respectively. Ten μg of expression vectors were co-transfected by electroporation as described above. Three or four independent experiments were performed in duplicate on PBMCs obtained from four healthy blood donors. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems automatic DNA synthesizer and purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The sequences synthesized (5′ to 3′) were: GB1 (−143 to −114), TCAGGCAGAGGCAGTGGGGGTGGGCAGCAT; IK, CATGAATGGGGGTGGCAGAGA; GB2 (−103 to −77), TCTGTGATGAGACACCACAAAACCAGA; and AP-1, CGTGACTCAGCGCGG. All have been previously described (36Wargnier A. Legros-Maı̈da S. Bosselut R. Bourge J.F. Lafaurie C. Ghysdael J. Sasportes M. Paul P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Single-stranded oligonucleotides were 5′ end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and annealed with a 2-fold excess of the unlabeled complementary strand. The probe was incubated in a 20-μl reaction mix containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 2 μg of nuclear extract in electrophoretic mobility shift assay buffer (40 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7. 5, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 4% Ficoll). DNA-protein complexes were separated by 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and revealed by autoradiography. Granzyme B promoter fragments were obtained by restriction enzyme digestions or polymerase chain reaction amplification from CAT3A, CAT3AM1, CAT3AM2 vectors previously described (36Wargnier A. Legros-Maı̈da S. Bosselut R. Bourge J.F. Lafaurie C. Ghysdael J. Sasportes M. Paul P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6930-6934Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The A construct containing −148 to +60 human granzyme B promoter and the AM1, AM2, and AM2A (mutation within the GB2A region (−103 to −84): TCTTTTATTATACACCACAA) corresponding to mutations in the Ikaros binding site, AP-1/CBF binding sites, and the AP-1 binding site, respectively, were inserted upstream of the promoterless luciferase reporter gene of the basic pGL3 vector (Promega). The wild type or mutated −148 to −77 granzyme B promoter region was also inserted upstream of the SV40 promoter in the pGL3 promoter vector (Promega). The mutations were confirmed by dideoxy-DNA sequencing of the constructs. After 48 h of culture, 5 × 106 PHA-activated cells were transfected by electroporation using 4 μg of plasmid. Ten-ml aliquots were measured for 10 s following the injection of luciferase reagent as recommended by the manufacturer (luciferase assay, Promega) using a luminometer (Berthold Systems, Inc.). Three independent experiments were performed in duplicate on PBMCs obtained from three healthy blood donors. Twenty μg of nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (36Wargnier A. Legros-Maı̈da S. Bosselut R. Bourge J.F. Lafaurie C. Ghysdael J. Sasportes M. Paul P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6930-6934Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and whole extracts were prepared by the Sambrook method (44Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.66-16.67Google Scholar) from PHA-activated PBMCs after 48 h of culture either without or with various concentrations of dexamethasone (1 μm, 100 nm) and loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (BA83, Sera Labo) and blocked overnight with 5% nonfat milk/phosphate-buffered saline, 3% Tween 20. Membranes were incubated for 1 h with a 1/1000 dilution of a purified anti-Ikaros serum (45Hahm K. Ernst P. Lo K. Kim G. Turck C. Smale S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7111-7123Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), then washed and revealed using goat anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugate (1/5000, 1 h). Peroxidase was revealed with an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL kit. Proteins were quantified before being loaded onto the gel, and equal loading of extracts with and without dexamethasone was verified by Ponceau coloration. Anti-Ikaros serum was kindly provided by Dr. Smale. Fos proteins were detected with an anti-Fos monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) revealed by an anti-mouse peroxidase conjugate (1/2000, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Granzyme B mRNAs expression was studied by Northern blot analysis of total RNA samples extracted from unstimulated and PHA-stimulated PBMCs. As expected (34Heusel J.W. Hanson R.D. Silverman G.A. Ley T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6152-6158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), no expression was found in resting cells, whereas granzyme B transcripts were detected in PHA-stimulated cells (Fig.1). The addition of dexamethasone abrogated the induction of human granzyme B messenger RNA expression, which was observed after PHA stimulation of PBMCs (Fig. 1). CD8+ T lymphocytes, which expressed a higher granzyme B level than CD4+ T lymphocytes, are highly sensitive to dexamethasone-induced apoptosis (46Lanza L. Scudeletti M. Puppo F. Bosco O. Peirano L. Filaci G. Fecarotta E. Vidali G. Indiveri F. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1996; 103: 482-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To eliminate the possibility of dexamethasone-induced down-regulation of granzyme B transcription because of apoptosis of CD8+ cells, the CD4+/CD8+ ratio before and after dexamethasone treatment was analyzed by cytofluorometry. No difference in this ratio could be demonstrated (data not shown). To determine whether one of the possible mechanisms of dexamethasone inhibition of granzyme B mRNA induction involved a change in the transcriptional activity of the human granzyme B promoter, we transiently transfected PHA-activated PBMCs with a vector in which the CAT reporter gene transcription was under the control of the human granzyme B gene proximal promoter (−148 to + 60) (35Haddad P. Wargnier A. Bourge J.F. Sasportes M. Paul P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 36Wargnier A. Legros-Maı̈da S. Bosselut R. Bourge J.F. Lafaurie C. Ghysdael J. Sasportes M. Paul P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6930-6934Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The CAT activity driven by the reporter fragment was significantly inhibited by treatment with three different concentrations of dexamethasone (1 μm, 100 nm, and 10 nm) (Fig.2). Dexamethasone was thus found to inhibit granzyme B promoter activation in a dose-dependent manner. We investigated whether dexamethasone inhibited granzyme B gene transcription by interfering with nuclear proteins that bind to the human granzyme B promoter. We have previously shown that the Ikaros binding site GB1 (−143 to −114) and the AP-1/CBF binding site GB2 (−103 to −77) were essential for the activation of transcription in PHA-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes (36Wargnier A. Legros-Maı̈da S. Bosselut R. Bourge J.F. Lafaurie C. Ghysdael J. Sasportes M. Paul P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6930-6934Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts from PHA-stimulated PBMCs were analyzed by mobility shift assays with GB1 and GB2 probes, and the consensus Ikaros binding site was derived from the mouse CD3 δ-chain gene enhancer (42Georgopoulos K. Moore D.D. Derfler B. Science. 1992; 258: 808-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). These results revealed that dexamethasone inhibited the binding of nuclear transcription factors to the Ikaros GB1 site (Fig. 3 A) as well as to the consensus Ikaros binding site (Fig. 3 B, IK) and reduced AP-1 binding activity, whereas CBF binding activity to the GB2 site remained unaffected (Fig. 4).Figure 4Dexamethasone inhibits AP-1 binding activity but does not affect CBF binding activity to the AP-1/CBF GB2 site of the human granzyme B promoter in nuclear extracts from PHA-stimulated PBMCs. A 32P-end-labeled GB2 probe that includes the AP-1/CBF binding site of the human granzyme B promoter was incubated with nuclear extracts prepared from PHA-stimulated PBMCs in the presence or absence of Dex (see “Experimental Procedures”). AP-1-and CBF-related complexes are indicated and have been previously described (36Wargnier A. Legros-Maı̈da S. Bosselut R. Bourge J.F. Lafaurie C. Ghysdael J. Sasportes M. Paul P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 18564-18571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To further evaluate the contribution of these sites to the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on the granzyme B promoter, we introduced mutations able to selectively abolish binding of complexes to the Ikaros, AP-1, or AP-1/CBF sites in the context of the granzyme B promoter (36Wargnier A. Legros-Maı̈da S. Bosselut R. Bourge J.F. Lafaurie C. Ghysdael J. Sasportes M. Paul P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6930-6934Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To gain sensibility in this analysis, these granzyme B promoter constructs were introduced in a luciferase promoterless reporter construct. As shown in Fig.5 A, the transcriptional activity of the granzyme B promoter in PHA-stimulated PBMCs was significantly inhibited by dexamethasone. Mutations that abolished the binding of the nuclear factors on the Ikaros binding site partially reduced the granzyme B promoter activity in PHA-activated cells, but treatment with dexamethasone was still able to modulate the residual luciferase activity driven by the Ikaros-mutated promoter fragment. This result is in favor of a role for the AP-1 binding site in dexamethasone-mediated inhibition. Mutations of the AP-1/CBF binding site or selective mutations of the AP-1 binding site also reduced the level of granzyme B promoter activity in PHA-activated cells. An inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on the mutated promoter containing an intact Ikaros binding site was still observed, confirming the role of the Ikaros regulatory element in dexamethasone-mediated inhibition. Similar results were obtained by insertion of a limited region of the granzyme B promoter (−148 to −77), which only contains wild type or mutated Ikaros and AP-1/CBF binding sites upstream of the SV40 promoter in the pGL3 vector (data not shown). Altogether these data show that the two DNA binding sites, Ikaros and AP-1, both represent critical regulatory targets for dexamethasone-induced down-regulation of the granzyme B promoter. Considering the critical role of the AP-1 binding site, we tested the effect of cotransfection of a c-Jun expression vector on the dexamethasone-mediated inhibition of the granzyme B promoter. As shown in Fig. 5 B, cotransfection of c-Jun expression vector partially restores PHA activation of the granzyme B promoter in presence of dexamethasone. In addition, the cotransfection experiment with c-Jun cannot reverse glucocorticoid-mediated repression of CAT2AM2(77), corresponding to mutation on the AP-1/CBF binding site with an intact Ikaros binding site but is very potent at reversing repression of CAT2AM1(77), corresponding to the mutation in the Ikaros binding site with an intact AP-1/CBF binding site (Fig. 5 C). These results show that c-Jun cotransfection has no effect on the Ikaros binding site activity. The Dex treatment and the c-Jun cotransfection have no effect on the PBLCAT2 vector activity (data not shown). As potential candidate proteins that could interact with the granzyme B Ikaros regulatory element, we studied the effect of dexamethasone on Ikaros protein expression in PHA-activated PBMCs. Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts revealed that dexamethasone treatment is associated with a moderate decrease of the bands whose size correspond to Ik1 and Ik2/3 isoforms (45Hahm K. Ernst P. Lo K. Kim G. Turck C. Smale S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7111-7123Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 47Molnar A. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell.

Immunol. 1996; 156: 585-592PubMed Google Scholar) and apparition of a band with a smaller size (Fig. 6). In contrast, the expression of Ikaros proteins was unchanged by the dexamethasone treatment in whole extracts (data not shown). These results suggested that dexamethasone modulates protein nuclear expression of Ikaros isoforms. However, cotransfection experiments with Ik1 and Ik2 expression vectors (47Molnar A. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8292-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) did not restore activity of the granzyme B promoter in dexamethasone-treated PHA PBMCs (data not shown), suggesting that overexpression of these isoforms per se is not able to counterbalance the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone. Although glucocorticoids are among the most potent and widely used immunosuppressive agents, the mechanisms by which they suppress the immune response have not yet been clearly defined. Glucocorticoids have been shown to be able to affect monocyte and T lymphocyte proliferation and function (49Boumpas D.T. Paliogianni F. Anastassiou E.D. Balow J.E. Clin. Exp. Rheumatol. 1991; 9: 413-423PubMed Google Scholar, 50Gillis S. Crabtree G.R. Smith K.A. J. Immunol. 1979; 123: 1624-1631PubMed Google Scholar, 51Gillis S. Crabtree G.R. Smith K.A. J. Immunol. 1979; 123: 1632-1638PubMed Google Scholar). The main mechanism by which they exert their powerful effects is modulation of the expression of specific sets of genes (49Boumpas D.T. Paliogianni F. Anastassiou E.D. Balow J.E. Clin. Exp. Rheumatol. 1991; 9: 413-423PubMed Google Scholar). Glucocorticoids have been shown to inhibit cytokine expression at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Recently, in addition to its distal effect on gene expression, dexamethasone has been described as down-regulating T-cell activation by inhibiting the transduction of activation signals initiated upon T-cell receptor occupancy (52Baus E. Andris F. Dubois P.M. Urbain J. Leo O. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4555-4561PubMed Google Scholar) and IL-2 receptor (53Paliogianni F. Ahuja S.S. Ballow J.P. Balow J.E. Boumpas D.T. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4081-4089PubMed Google Scholar, 54Paliogianni F. Hama N. Balow J.E. Valentine M.A. Boumpas D.T. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1809-1817PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to IL-2 and interferon γ gene expression, which are early events in T-cell activation, induction of granzyme B gene transcription is a late-phase event that characterizes the acquisition of the cytotoxic function by T lymphocytes. The results of this study demonstrated that inhibition of late-phase granzyme B gene expression by glucocorticoids occurred at the transcriptional level, resulting in a concentration-dependent inhibition of granzyme B gene promoter activity. Glucocorticoids exert their effects after diffusing into target cells, where they bind to their cytoplasmic receptor. This complex then translocates to the nucleus, where it inhibits the transcription of target genes. This inhibition can occur through direct binding to the glucocorticoid response elements, located within the promoter region of the genes (55Drouin J. Parker M.G. Frontiers in Molecular Biology: Steroid Action. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 118-140Google Scholar). No differential DNA binding activity to putative glucocorticoid receptor element sites identified within the granzyme B promoter by sequence homologies to glucocorticoid receptor element consensus sequences could be detected (data not shown). Other mechanisms of glucocorticoid suppressive effects that involve antagonism of the action of transcription factors required for transcriptional activation have been described (55Drouin J. Parker M.G. Frontiers in Molecular Biology: Steroid Action. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 118-140Google Scholar). Inhibition of IL-2 gene transcription is thought to be the consequence of negative interference with AP-1 and NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) nuclear transcriptional factors, which have been previously demonstrated to be of crucial importance for the activity of this cytokine promoter (18Paliogianni F. Raptis A. Ahuja S. Najjar S. Boumpas D. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1481-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 19Vacca A. Felli M. Farina A. Martinotti S. Maroder M. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 637-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Although AP-1 is involved in lymphokine gene induction, interference with AP-1 activity cannot account for the full spectrum of immunoregulatory genes affected by glucocorticoids. More recently, glucocorticoids have been shown to inhibit the activity of the NF-κB transcription factor by increasing transcription and protein synthesis of its cytoplasmic inhibitor IκBα (27Scheinman R.I. Cogswell P.C. Lofquist A.K. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1995; 270: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar, 29Auphan N. DiDonato J.A. Rosette C. Helmberg A. Karin M. Science. 1995; 270: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2134) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that dexamethasone represses the DNA binding activity of nuclear NF-κB (28Scheinman R.I. Gualberto A. Jewell C.M. Cidlowski J.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 943-953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Ray A. Prefontaine K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Glucocorticoid suppression of a member of the rat IL-8 family is also mediated by impairment of NF-κB activation (24Ohtsuka T. Kubota A. Hirano T. Watanabe K. Yoshida H. Tsurufuji M. Iizuka Y. Konishi K. Tsurufuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1651-1659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that dexamethasone inhibits granzyme B gene promoter activity induction by interfering with the binding of nuclear transcription factors to the Ikaros GB1 site and by reducing the amount of AP-1 binding activity while not affecting CBF binding activity to the GB2 site. The mechanism by which AP-1 is inhibited by glucocorticoids is well documented and implicates interaction between the glucocorticoid receptor and Jun and Fos, the two proteins that transactivate transcription when binding to the AP-1 site (26Jonat C.

The role of an Ikaros binding site in the dexamethasone-mediated inhibition of gene transcription has not yet been described. Candidate proteins that could bind the granzyme B Ikaros site are the different isoforms (Ik1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) encoded by the Ikaros gene (45Hahm K. Ernst P. Lo K. Kim G. Turck C. Smale S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7111-7123Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 47Molnar A. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8292-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 48Molnar A. Wu P.

Science. 1992; 258: 808-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 60Georgopoulos K. Bigby M. Wang J.H. Molnar A. Wu P. Winandy S. Sharpe A. Cell. 1994; 79: 143-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Ikaros activity is controlled by the nature of the complexes formed between its expressed isoforms (61Sun L. Liu A. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Homo- and heterodimer formation between the DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms (Ik1, 2, and 3) greatly increases their affinity for DNA and their consequent ability to activate transcription. Heterodimers formed between isoforms Ik1, 2, and 3 with Ik4, 5, and 6 lead to transcriptionally inactive forms (61Sun L. Liu A. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Hence, heterodimers that include one Ikaros isoform that lacks a DNA binding domain are transcriptionally inert. The observation of a new band detected by Western blot using the anti-Ikaros antibody with nuclear extracts upon dexamethasone treatment is compatible with the expression of such an isoform lacking the DNA binding domain. As recently suggested, such isoforms could interfere with the activity of Ikaros or Ikaros-like binding factors such as Aiolos, Helios, p30 (62Morgan B. Sun L. Avitahl N. Andrikopoulos K. Ikeda T. Gonzales H. Wu P. Neben S. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2004-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 63Hahm K. Cobb B. McCarty A. Brown K. Klug C. Lee R. Akashi K. Weissman I. Fisher A.

Dexamethasone treatment could generate the presence in the nucleus of a dominant negative isoform. This interpretation is compatible with the absence of retarded bound complexes in bandshift assay. Morever, our preliminary results are not in favor of an enhancement of granzyme B promoter activity consecutive to independent cotransfection of recombinant Ik1 and Ik2 isoforms. This suggests that other lineage-specific partners may interact with the granzyme B Ikaros regulatory element. Further analyses are necessary to elucidate dexamethasone inhibition mechanisms involving the Ikaros regulatory element. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that Ikaros and AP-1 binding sites of the human granzyme B promoter are both critical for the dexamethasone-induced down-regulation of the granzyme B gene expression.

https://openalex.org/W1976555242,"Sialomucin complex (SMC, Rat Muc4) is a heterodimeric glycoprotein complex consisting of a mucin subunit ASGP-1 (ascitessialoglycoprotein-1) and a transmembrane subunit ASGP-2, which can act as a ligand for the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2. SMC is highly expressed on the surface of ascites 13762 rat mammary adenocarcinoma cells, approximately 100 times the level in lactating mammary gland and 104times that in virgin mammary gland. SMC is sharply increased at mid-pregnancy in a manner similar to β-casein. Unlike β-casein, SMC appears to be regulated post-transcriptionally. Its transcript is present in both virgin and pregnant mammary tissue, and SMC synthesis is induced rapidly in cultured primary mammary epithelial cells from either normal pregnant or virgin rats. SMC protein, but not transcript, levels are significantly reduced when mammary cells are cultured in Matrigel, a reconstituted basement membrane which stimulates casein expression. SMC precursor is synthesized in Matrigel at a 10-fold lower rate. Matrigel has no effect on either the level of SMC or its transcript in cultured 13762 mammary tumor cells. The Matrigel effect on primary mammary and 13762 cells is mimicked by transforming growth factor β, a component associated with this complex matrix. These results indicate that SMC is a novel product of normal mammary gland and milk, which is post-transcriptionally regulated by transforming growth factor β in normal mammary gland, but not in 13762 mammary adenocarcinoma cells.

For example, β-casein, an “early” milk protein which is detectable around day 6 of pregnancy in the mouse, is transcriptionally regulated by laminin through β1 integrins (6Lin C.Q. Bissell M.J. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 7Streuli C.H. Schmidhauser C. Bailey N. Yurchenco P. Skubitz A.P.N. Roskelley C. Bissell M.J. J.

Whey acidic protein (WAP), a “late” milk protein whose message becomes detectable around day 14 of pregnancy in the mouse, is dependent on an ECM-induced three-dimensional alveolar structure (6Lin C.Q.

J. 1990; 265: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). SMC is transcribed from a single gene as a 9-kilobase transcript (14Sheng Z. Wu K. Carraway K.L. Fregien N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16341-16346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wu K. Fregien N. Carraway K.L. J. Biol.

Hull S.R. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8505-8510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mature glycosylated ASGP-1 has a molecular mass of >500 kDa (9Sherblom A.P. Buck R.L. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 783-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with a polypeptide molecular mass of ≈220 kDa (15Wu K. Fregien N. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11950-11955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and comprises three domains: an N-terminal unique sequence, a large tandem repeat region rich in serine and threonine residues similar to that of other mucins, and a C-terminal unique sequence (15Wu K. Fregien N. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11950-11955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ASGP-2 is a 120–140-kDa protein that consists of seven domains: two hydrophilic N-glycosylated regions, two EGF-like domains, a cysteine-rich domain, a transmembrane domain, and a small cytoplasmic domain (14Sheng Z. Wu K. Carraway K.L. Fregien N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16341-16346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In tumor cells sialomucin complex may have dual functions. 1) ASGP-1 can provide anti-recognition and anti-adhesive properties to tumor cells (11Carraway K.L. Spielman J. Mol. Cell.

In A375 melanoma cells stably transfected with SMC DNA linked to a tetracycline-regulated promoter, expression of SMC abolishes cell-matrix adhesion and cell-cell interactions (18Komatsu M.

Furthermore, SMC expression in these cells reduces their killing by natural killer cells. 2M. Komatsu, C. A. C. Carraway, N. Fregien, and K. L. Carraway, manuscript in preparation. This anti-recognition property may be important to the high metastatic capacity of the 13762 ascites cells (9Sherblom A.P. Buck R.L. Carraway K.L. J. Biol.

Carraway K.L. Fregien N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16341-16346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and SMC has been shown to bind to the receptor ErbB2. Thus, the transmembrane subunit ASGP-2 is proposed to modulate signaling through the EGF family of receptors via its interaction with ErbB2, 3K. L. Carraway III, E. A. Rossi, S. A. Price-Schiavi, M.

Cell. 1994; 78: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), for which no ligand has been described to date. This interaction may play a role in the constitutive phosphorylation of ErbB2 in the 13762 ascites cells (21Juang S.-H. Carvajal M.E. Whitney M. Liu Y. Carraway C.A.C. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1033-1042PubMed Google Scholar) and the high proliferative activity of these cells. Sialomucin complex is not mammary specific. It is expressed in a number of normal secretory epithelial tissues in the adult rat, including small and large intestine, trachea, and uterus (8Rossi E.A. McNeer R. Price-Schiavi S.A. Van den Brande J.M.H. Komatsu M. Thompson J.F. Carraway C.A.C. Fregien N.L. Carraway K.L. J. Biol.

Biosci. 1997; 2: 449-459Crossref Google Scholar). In the trachea it is constitutively expressed on the apical surface of the cells lining the lumen (17McNeer R.R. Price-Schiavi S.A. Komatsu M. Fregien N. Carraway C.A.C. Carraway K.L. Front. Biosci. 1997; 2: 449-459Crossref Google Scholar). SMC is also constitutively expressed in the normal adult rat intestine. In the adult small intestine SMC is observed only in Paneth cells at the bases of the crypts of Lieberkuhn, while in the colon it is found specifically in goblet cells (8Rossi E.A. McNeer R. Price-Schiavi S.A. Van den Brande J.M.H. Komatsu M. Thompson J.F. Carraway C.A.C. Fregien N.L. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33476-33485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In the uterus, SMC is observed on the luminal surface of the endometrium and in glandular cells. Its expression is regulated at the mRNA level by the ovarian hormones estrogen and progesterone (22McNeer R.R. Carraway C.A.C. Fregien N. Carraway K.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These results suggest that SMC has multiple and complex regulatory mechanisms in the normal adult rat. SMC is abundant in milk (ASGP-2 concentration, ∼10 μg/ml) and lactating mammary gland, but its level is very low in the virgin gland. In lactating mammary tissue it is localized at the apical surface of secretory epithelial cells lining the alveoli. It appears to be located within the cytoplasm, not limited to the plasma membrane or milk fat globule membrane, suggesting that its location is in the mammary secretory granules (8Rossi E.A. McNeer R. Price-Schiavi S.A. Van den Brande J.M.H. Komatsu M. Thompson J.F. Carraway C.A.C. Fregien N.L. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33476-33485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In this tissue SMC is expressed as both membrane and soluble forms, the soluble form lacking the transmembrane and C-terminal domains. Interestingly, the level of SMC in the 13762 ascites cells is about 100-fold greater than that in the lactating mammary gland (8Rossi E.A. McNeer R. Price-Schiavi S.A. Van den Brande J.M.H.

These results suggest that SMC is developmentally regulated in normal mammary gland, but that this regulation is lost in the rat mammary ascites tumor. Recent studies have helped to define the place of SMC among the hierarchy of known mucins. Cloning and sequencing of full-length human MUC4 show substantial similarities between the MUC4 and rat SMC at the N– and C-terminal portions of the molecules (23Nollet S. Moniaux N. Maury J. Petitprezk D. Degand P. Laine A. Porchet N. Aubert J.-P. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 739-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). 4J.-P. Aubert, results presented at the Fifth Workshop on Tumor Mucins, Cambridge, United Kingdom. They differ in their repeat domains. In particular, SMC does not have the 16-amino acid repeat cloned and sequenced in the original description of MUC4 (24Porchet N. Nguyen V.C. Dufosse J. Audie J.P. Guyonnet Duperat V. Gross M.S. Denis C. Degand P. Bernheim A. Aubert J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Thus, the similarity between the molecules was not observed previously. However, the 70% identity between the human MUC4 analog of ASGP-2 and rat ASGP-2 provides strong evidence that they are homologous proteins. In an effort to understand the regulation of SMC in normal mammary gland, we have examined both mammary tissue and cultures of primary mammary epithelial cells. In vivo SMC expression is superficially similar to that of β-casein and is clearly developmentally regulated. In vitro, however, in contrast to β-casein, which requires ECM for expression, SMC levels are significantly reduced in the presence of Matrigel, a reconstituted ECM preparation. Unlike β-casein, high levels of SMC can be induced within hours in cultured virgin mammary epithelial cells. Furthermore, SMC message is expressed at all times in the normal developing mammary gland, unlike the protein, which is not present in virgin gland and increases as pregnancy proceeds. In addition, TGFβ can reduce the level of SMC protein without affecting the level of SMC transcript, suggesting that it is the factor responsible for post-transcriptional regulation of SMC in normal MEC. These data suggest that SMC is a novel post-transcriptionally regulated product of the mammary gland and milk. The MAT-B1 ascites subline of the 13762 rat mammary adenocarcinoma was maintained by weekly passage, as described previously (25Carraway K.L. Doss R.C. Huggins J.W. Chesnut R.W. Carraway C.A.C. J.

Anti-β-casein mouse monoclonal antibody used for immunoblots was kindly provided by Dr. Charlotte Kaetzel (University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY). TGFβ was purchased from R & D Systems, Inc. Cell culture materials were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc., unless otherwise noted. For Northern blots total RNA was isolated from whole normal mammary tissue, mammary epithelial cells, or 13762 MAT-B1 cells using TRI REAGENT™ (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH), and 25 μg were electrophoresed on 1% formaldehyde/agarose gels. Resolved RNAs were transferred to ZetaProbe positively charged nylon membranes (Bio-Rad), followed by cross-linking using a Stratalinker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The membranes were prehybridized for at least 2 h at 42 °C in prehybridization solution (50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's reagent, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA). The probe, A2G2–9, a 1.7-kilobase probe which spans the 5′ unique region and four tandem repeats of SMC cDNA, was random primed labeled with [32P]dCTP using a Random Primed Labeling kit (Boehringer-Mannheim). The membranes were hybridized overnight at 42 °C in prehybridization solution containing 0.1 g/ml dextran sulfate and the labeled probe. Following hybridization, membranes were washed once at room temperature in 2 × SSC with 0.1% SDS for 15 min, twice at 50 °C in 2 × SSC with 0.1% SDS for 20 min each, and once at 50 °C in 0.1X SSC with 0.1% SDS for 15 min. Signals were detected by exposure with Kodak XAR-5 x-ray film. For Western blots, SDS-PAGE was performed under reducing conditions using 6% polyacrylamide gels and the mini-Protean II system (Bio-Rad). Resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes which were subsequently blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.5% Tween 20. After a 1-h incubation in primary antibody diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin/Tris-buffered saline with 0.5% Tween 20, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG Fc-specific (Pierce, Rockford, IL) diluted 1:20,000 in 1% bovine serum albumin/Tris-buffered saline with 0.5% Tween 20. Signals were detected with the RenaissanceTM Enhanced Chemiluminescence kit (NEN Life Science Products Inc., Boston, MA). Mammary tissue dissected from female Fischer 344 rats was pulverized with a mortar and pestle in liquid N2 and stored as a powder at −80 °C. For immunoblotting, tissue powders were solubilized directly into SDS-PAGE sample buffer at a concentration of 10 mg/ml wet weight. For quantitation of total protein, powders were solubilized in 1% SDS in water, boiled, and clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g. Protein concentrations were determined by Lowry assay of the cleared SDS lysates. Primary mammary epithelial cell cultures were established using previously described protocols (26Emerman J.T.

Briefly, mammary glands excised from virgin or pregnant female Fischer 344 rats were minced, resuspended in digestion media comprised of 1 mg/ml collagenase type II (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Freehold, NJ), and 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin in Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated at 37 °C with shaking for 45 min. Fully and partially digested epithelial cell clusters were pelleted and incubated a second time in digestion buffer at 37 °C with shaking for 45 min. Digested epithelial cell clusters were pelleted, resuspended in PBS, and passed through a 520-μm cell sieve to remove undigested material. Mammary epithelial cell clusters in the resulting filtrate were captured on a 70-μm nylon membrane. Cell clusters were collected by rinsing the membrane with PBS and were subsequently washed three times in PBS prior to plating. Incubating freshly isolated cells on a plastic tissue culture plate for 1 h permitted attachment and removal of fibroblasts. Mammary epithelial cell clusters were resuspended and plated in equal aliquots in Ham's F-12 medium containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and either 10% FCS and 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin or 5 μg/ml insulin, 10 μg/ml transferrin, 0.3 μg/ml sodium selenite, and 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Where indicated, media were supplemented with 5 μg/ml insulin, 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 3 μg/ml prolactin, and/or various concentrations (2.5–20 ng/ml) of TGFβ. For plating with embedding in ECM (Matrigel, Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford MA), cells were resuspended in 1.5 ml of ice-cold Matrigel diluted 1:3 with serum-free Ham's F-12 medium, plated at 1.5 μl/mm2 of tissue culture plastic, and allowed to solidify at 37 °C for 30 min. The solidified Matrigel was then overlaid with 2 ml of either serum-free or serum-containing medium. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 48 h prior to harvest. Cells were collected from culture on plastic dishes by scraping cells off the dish. Cells were harvested from Matrigel cultures using the recommended protocol for Matrisperse (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA), an enzyme-free Matrigel dissociation buffer. For all samples, harvested cells were pelleted, washed with PBS, and lysed in 100 μl of 1% SDS in water. Protein concentration of the cell lysates was determined by Lowry assay, and 5 μg of total protein was loaded for immunoblot analysis. Mammary epithelial cells were isolated from virgin rats and cultured either on plastic or embedded in Matrigel in serum-free medium. After 24 h cells were washed twice with PBS, starved for 30 min in Cys/Met free Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 10 mmHepes, and incubated in 1 ml of labeling medium (starvation medium + 230 μCi of [35S]Cys + [35S]Met per ml) (EXPRE35S35S Protein Labeling Mix, NEN Life Science Products) for times ranging from 5 to 180 min. Labeled cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in 400 μl of 2% SDS in H2O. Lysed cells were boiled for 1 min, sonicated for 10 min in a bath sonicator, and diluted in 2 ml of Triton immunoprecipitation buffer (2.5% Triton X-100, 190 mmNaCl, 60 mm Tris-HCl, 6 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). Diluted cell lysates were centrifuged at 175,000 × gfor 40 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-ASGP-2 antiserum and protein A-agarose beads (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C with rotation. Immunoprecipitates were washed with RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris base, pH 8.0) six times for 15 min each at 4 °C with rotation. A fraction of immunoprecipitation supernatant was collected for analysis of total labeled protein. Washed immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 20 μl of SDS sample buffer and immunoprecipitate supernatant was diluted 1:1 in SDS sample buffer. Diluted samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography with Fluoro-Hance autoradiography enhancer (Research Products International Corp., Mount Prospect, IL). Mammary homogenates from virgin, pregnant, lactating, and involuting rats were analyzed by anti-ASGP-2 and anti-β-casein immunoblots to study the expression pattern of SMC in normal developing mammary gland and to compare its expression pattern to that of β-casein. In all tissues studied to date, including mammary gland (8Rossi E.A. McNeer R. Price-Schiavi S.A. Van den Brande J.M.H. Komatsu M. Thompson J.F. Carraway C.A.C. Fregien N.L. Carraway K.L. J. Biol.

Biosci. 1997; 2: 449-459Crossref Google Scholar), ASGP-1 and ASGP-2 are present as a complex, allowing us to use immunoblotting of ASGP-2 for the analysis of SMC. Moreover, our antibodies to ASGP-2 are more sensitive and more specific than those for ASGP-1. As previously reported (8Rossi E.A. McNeer R. Price-Schiavi S.A. Van den Brande J.M.H. Komatsu M. Thompson J.F. Carraway C.A.C. Fregien N.L. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33476-33485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), SMC is minimal in virgin mammary gland. Its level increases sharply (approximately 40-fold) during mid-pregnancy, reaches a maximum in late pregnancy and during lactation, and decreases during involution (Figs.1, A and B). The expression pattern of β-casein is similar, but it reaches maximal levels about 1 to 2 days earlier than SMC. β-Casein is maintained throughout lactation and decreases more rapidly than SMC during involution. These data suggest that, like β-casein, SMC is developmentally regulated in normal mammary gland, but that it may have a different regulatory mechanism. The mammary gland is made up of several cell types. SMC is expressed in the secretory luminal epithelial cells (8Rossi E.A. McNeer R. Price-Schiavi S.A. Van den Brande J.M.H. Komatsu M. Thompson J.F. Carraway C.A.C. Fregien N.L. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33476-33485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, it is necessary to study the level of SMC in isolated MEC to determine if the apparent increase in SMC in developing mammary gland is a consequence of a real increase in SMC production or an increase in the proportion of epithelial cells relative to other cell types during pregnancy. For this reason mammary epithelial cells were isolated by collagenase digestion from virgin and pregnant rats, and anti-ASGP-2 and anti-β-casein immunoblots were performed. To test whether cell surface SMC is degraded by collagenase, MAT-B1 ascites cells were treated with collagenase under the same conditions. Immunoblots of collagenase-treated ascites cells showed no difference in the level of SMC compared with that of untreated cells (data not shown). As seen in whole tissue, SMC is low in virgin mammary epithelial cells and increases sharply in MEC from mid- and late-pregnant animals (Fig.1 C). β-Casein expression is also minimal in virgin MEC and is detectable at maximum levels in MEC from both mid- and late-pregnant animals. As seen in whole tissue, β-casein reaches maximum levels earlier than SMC. Thus, the expression of these proteins in the isolated cells reflects that in the mammary tissue and thus can be used as a model for the study of regulatory mechanisms. To determine whether the expression pattern of the SMC transcript is similar to that for the protein, total RNA was prepared from mammary epithelial cells freshly isolated from virgin and pregnant rats, and Northern blot analysis was performed using probe A2G2-9, which was generated from the 5′ 1.7-kilobases of SMC cDNA. Surprisingly, SMC transcript is present at equivalent levels in MEC at all time points tested (Fig. 2). This expression pattern for SMC transcript is different from that for the protein, which is low in virgin gland and increases sharply as pregnancy proceeds (Fig. 1). Furthermore, this pattern also differs from that of β-casein message, which is undetectable in MEC until mid-pregnancy (6Lin C.Q. Bissell M.J. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). These results suggest that, unlike β-casein, regulation of SMC in normal rat mammary epithelial cells in vivo occurs post-transcriptionally. Primary culture of mammary epithelial cells has been used to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of several milk proteins, including β-casein. These systems are useful because the level of differentiation/functionality can be maintained and manipulated. In the presence of ECM and lactogenic hormones (insulin, hydrocortisone, and prolactin), isolated mammary epithelial cells will form round alveolar structures with closed lumens and will vectorially secrete milk proteins. On plastic these cells form squamous epithelial monolayers and are considered undifferentiated because milk proteins are not synthesized. Thein vivo expression patterns of SMC and β-casein are different, suggesting that SMC may be regulated differently than β-casein or other early milk protein genes. Expression of β-casein in isolated mammary epithelial cells is dependent on the presence of extracellular matrix components (or basement membrane). In the presence of a reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel), mammary epithelial cells from pregnant mice and virgin rats can be induced t"
https://openalex.org/W2085133713,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase (IN) undergoes a reversible metal-induced conformational change that activates the enzyme (Asante-Appiah, E., and Skalka, A. M. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 16196–16205). In this report, key structural features that mediate this conformational change have been identified by site-directed mutagenesis, limited proteolysis, and mass spectrometry studies. The results reveal two separable metal-induced effects. One depends on residues in the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–50) and a C-terminal tail (amino acids 274–288) and is detected by increased resistance of the full-length protein to proteolytic digestion. This effect appears to depend on metal binding at an undefined location distinct from the known sites in the N-terminal and catalytic core domains. The second conformational change depends on metal binding at the active site in the catalytic core domain. Substitution of acidic residues Asp64 or Glu152 in the catalytic core D,D(35)E motif or truncation of the Src homology 3 (SH3)-like domain in the C-terminal region of the enzyme abolishes this metal-induced change. Comparison of tryptic digests of an HIV-1 IN derivative competent for metal-induced conformational change and a conformation-defective D64N derivative identified specific regions in HIV-1 IN that are affected by this second change. A region in the N terminus that spans Lys14, an extended loop and the adjacent region in the core domain (including lysines 136, 156, and 160 and Arg173), and residues at the C terminus beyond the SH3-like domain all become less accessible to proteolysis in the conformation-competent protein. In contrast, a region that encompasses Lys258 in the putative DNA binding groove of the SH3-like domain becomes more sensitive to proteolysis in the presence of Mn2+. The results are consistent with a model in which the binding of the metal ion by residues of the D,D(35)E motif elicits specific changes in all three domains of HIV-1 IN, inducing the restructuring of the enzyme for catalytic competence. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase (IN) undergoes a reversible metal-induced conformational change that activates the enzyme (Asante-Appiah, E., and Skalka, A. M. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 16196–16205). In this report, key structural features that mediate this conformational change have been identified by site-directed mutagenesis, limited proteolysis, and mass spectrometry studies. The results reveal two separable metal-induced effects. One depends on residues in the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–50) and a C-terminal tail (amino acids 274–288) and is detected by increased resistance of the full-length protein to proteolytic digestion. This effect appears to depend on metal binding at an undefined location distinct from the known sites in the N-terminal and catalytic core domains. The second conformational change depends on metal binding at the active site in the catalytic core domain. Substitution of acidic residues Asp64 or Glu152 in the catalytic core D,D(35)E motif or truncation of the Src homology 3 (SH3)-like domain in the C-terminal region of the enzyme abolishes this metal-induced change. Comparison of tryptic digests of an HIV-1 IN derivative competent for metal-induced conformational change and a conformation-defective D64N derivative identified specific regions in HIV-1 IN that are affected by this second change. A region in the N terminus that spans Lys14, an extended loop and the adjacent region in the core domain (including lysines 136, 156, and 160 and Arg173), and residues at the C terminus beyond the SH3-like domain all become less accessible to proteolysis in the conformation-competent protein. In contrast, a region that encompasses Lys258 in the putative DNA binding groove of the SH3-like domain becomes more sensitive to proteolysis in the presence of Mn2+. The results are consistent with a model in which the binding of the metal ion by residues of the D,D(35)E motif elicits specific changes in all three domains of HIV-1 IN, inducing the restructuring of the enzyme for catalytic competence.

These acidic residues are essential for catalysis and are evolutionarily conserved; even conservative substitutions severely impair enzymatic activity (14Kulkosky J. Jones K.S. Katz R.A. Mack J.P.G.

It resembles the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, and analysis of a solution dimer by NMR revealed a saddle-shaped feature that may play a role in nonspecific DNA binding. The structure and contribution of the C-terminal tail (residues 271–288), however, remains unknown (Fig.1). Although the structures of all of the independently folding domains of HIV-1 integrase have been determined and models of how they may fit together have also been presented (8Cai M. Zheng R. Caffrey M. Craigie R. Clore M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar,24Heuer T.S. Brown P.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6667-6678Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), very little is known about the structural basis of catalysis. Previously, we reported that the metal cofactor induces a change in the conformation of HIV-1 IN that involves a reorganization of the core and C-terminal domains and leads to an activated competent enzyme (25Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16196-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To obtain further insight into this metal-dependent structural change, we have introduced specific deletions and amino acid substitutions into HIV-1 IN and assessed their influence on this property.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsHiTrap heparin and HiTrap chelating columns were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Goat anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase conjugate was bought from Fisher. Proteinase K was procured from Boehringer Mannheim. TPCK-treated trypsin was obtained from Pierce. Silver stain plus kit was from Bio-Rad.MethodsConstruction of HIV-1 IN Mutant Plasmid ClonesA plasmid that expresses the soluble derivative of HIV-1 IN, pET29bNY5IN F185K,C280S, has been described previously (25Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16196-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Codons specifying the active site D,D(35)E motif substitutions (D64A, D64N, E152A, and D64A,E152A) were introduced into HIV-1 IN coding sequences by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis following established methods (26Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short protocols in Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. Green Publishing Associates/John Wiley & Sons., Inc., New York1992: 8.3-8.5Google Scholar). DNA from positive clones was subsequently introduced intoE. coli BL21(DE3) cells for protein expression. All positive clones were verified by DNA sequencing.Construction of HIV-1 IN Deletion MutantsTwo primers complementary to the initiating and terminating sequences and in opposite orientations were used in a polymerase chain reaction to amplify the sequences that encode residues 1–285, 1–274, 1–253, and 22–288 of HIV-1 IN by established protocols (26Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short protocols in Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. Green Publishing Associates/John Wiley & Sons., Inc., New York1992: 8.3-8.5Google Scholar). pET29bNY5IN F185K,C280S was used as the template DNA in order to include the solubility-promoting F185K and C280S substitutions into these constructs. Construction of the isolated catalytic core domain IN-(50–212) and the core plus the C terminus, IN-(50–288), has been reported (25Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16196-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).Construction of pET29bHMK-HIV-1 INThe sequence that encodes the kinase site, RRASV (the underlined serine residue is phosphorylated), recognized by the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase from heart muscle (HMK) was introduced by polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis (26Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short protocols in Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. Green Publishing Associates/John Wiley & Sons., Inc., New York1992: 8.3-8.5Google Scholar). The cloning strategy ensured that the kinase-specific sequences preceded those that specify the N-terminal residues of HIV-1 IN. The restriction site for KpnI was also introduced between the sequences that encode the kinase site and HIV-1 IN in order to facilitate future subcloning of other IN derivatives into the vector backbone. The introduction of the KpnI restriction site leads to the expression of a Gly-Thr dipeptidyl linker between the kinase site and the N-terminal residue of integrase, Phe-1. Thus, a total of 8 amino acids (including the initiating methionine) precede the authentic 288 amino acids of HIV-1 IN when the protein is expressed. The correct construction of the clone was confirmed by DNA sequencing.Protein PurificationHIV-1 IN proteins were expressed in, and purified from, Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) as reported recently (25Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16196-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 27Asante-Appiah E. Merkel G. Skalka A.M. Protein Expr. Purif. 1998; 12: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).Limited ProteolysisThe protocol for assessing the effect of the metal cofactor on limited proteolysis of HIV-1 IN has been described previously (25Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16196-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These assays were performed in a 75-μl reaction containing 20 mm HEPES·KOH at a pH of 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol and 310 pmol of IN. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 10 mm MnCl2. Proteinase K or TPCK-treated trypsin at a final concentration of 4 ng/μl, was used in all experiments. At the times indicated in the figures, a 15-μl aliquot was removed and quenched by boiling at 95 °C for 5 min with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer (15 μl). The protein samples were subjected to electrophoresis in a 15% polyacrylamide gel and then silver-stained (Bio-Rad).The extent of limited proteolysis of 32P-end-labeled HMK-HIV-1 IN was quantitated following the separation of the proteolysis products (by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis), by exposing the gel to a Fuji imaging plate that was read on a Fuji MacBas 2000 imaging system.Protein samples earmarked for mass spectrometric analysis were quenched by adding trifluoroacetic acid to a final pH of 2. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) MS was performed on a PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager DE mass spectrometer in linear mode at an accelerating voltage of 20,000 V. The tryptic peptides were analyzed on a matrix of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. Melittin and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix dimer were used as internal mass standards. Several assigned integrase tryptic peptides in each mass spectrum were used subsequently for mass calibrations in the final reported results. Data from 128 scans were averaged.ImmunoblottingFollowing the separation of proteolysis products by electrophoresis in a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, the protein bands were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The SuperSignal chemiluminescent immunoblot kit (Pierce) was used for protein detection following the manufacturer's suggested protocol. Anti-HIV-1 IN monoclonal antibodies, mAbs 17 and 33, were used at a final concentration of 0.04 μg/ml, while mAb 4 was used at a final concentration 2 μg/ml.DISCUSSIONThe catalytic activity of HIV-1 IN is dependent upon the presence of a metal cofactor usually Mn2+ or Mg2+. It is now evident that in addition to acting as electrophiles, metal ions also play a structural role for the enzyme (25Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16196-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 31Vink C. Gronenger A.A.M.O. Plasterk R.H.A.

Virol. 1996; 70: 1424-1432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that includes induction of conformational changes in the protein (25Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16196-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Our studies of the influence of metal ions on the sensitivity of HIV-1 IN to proteinase K digestion reveal two distinct effects that can be dissociated from each other.One effect is increased resistance of the full-length protein and slightly shorter fragments (denoted band I) to proteinase K digestion. Site-directed mutagenesis studies, summarized in Fig. 4, show that this effect depends on sequences in the N- and C-terminal domains of the protein; it is lost when truncations extend to amino acids 50 and 274 from either end of the protein. However, the effect is independent of metal binding to the N-terminal zinc-binding HHCC motif because a protein in which the motif is disrupted (IN-(22–288)) remains resistant. The effect is also independent of metal binding to the D,D(53)E motif in the catalytic core domain; substitution of the metal-chelating residues in this motif does not reduce metal-induced resistance of the full-length protein. One other potential metal-binding locus that would include the last three acidic residues at the very C terminus of HIV-1 IN, Asp286, Glu287, and Asp288 (see Fig. 9), can also be eliminated, as these amino acids can be deleted (Fig. 4), and nearby Asp279 can be substituted with alanine 2E. Asante-Appiah, S. H. Seeholzer, and A. M. Skalka, unpublished data. without affecting this metal-induced change. Thus, binding of metal ions to a still undefined locus is postulated to explain this resistance to proteolysis. We are currently introducing single and multi-amino acid substitutions into HIV-1 IN in an attempt to uncover this putative new metal-binding site. The metal-bound conformation that gives rise to this resistance apparently results from defined interactions within the protein, as these can be specifically blocked by the C-terminal domain-specific anti HIV-1 IN monoclonal antibody, mAb 33. It is interesting to note that the ability of the metal cofactors, Mn2+ and Mg2+, to induce resistance of HIV-1 IN to proteolysis coincides with their ability to support catalysis. A 10-fold increase in half-life of HIV-1 IN contributed by Mn2+ binding (Fig. 6) translates to a change in free energy of ∼1.6 kcal/mol available for catalysis.The second effect that we have observed is the metal-induced appearance of new proteolytic digestion products (denoted band II) that include the catalytic core domain. Binding of metal ions to the D,D(35)E motif is required for the appearance of these products that migrate at the position of ∼18–21 kDa (band II). Site-directed mutagenesis experiments show that the appearance of band II products also requires the presence of the SH3-like domain in the C-terminal region. We hypothesize that the SH3-like domain may interact with the core domain to stabilize the changes that ensue as a consequence of metal binding at the active site.Because substitution of the metal-coordinating residues of the D,D(35)E motif in HIV-1 IN abolishes the conformational change that gives rise to new proteolytic products with both proteinase K and trypsin, we used the conservative D64N derivative and trypsin digestion to identify the regions of the protein that are affected by this change. This approach had the advantage that it allowed the addition of metal ions to both the D64N and the conformation-competent parental proteins and thus excluded nonspecific cation effects and the changes that result in increased resistance of full-length and slightly shorter fragments described above. By comparing products of the D64N and parental proteins using mass spectrometry, we identified the following specific metal-induced changes in the conformation of HIV-1 IN.The addition of metal ions rendered a trypsin cleavage site at Lys14 in the N terminus of HIV-1 IN less accessible to digestion. In the solution structure of an isolated N-terminal fragment of HIV-1 IN (residues 1–55) determined by NMR, two conformations of the domain, denoted D and E, are observed (8Cai M. Zheng R. Caffrey M. Craigie R. Clore M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In conformation E, α-helix 1 comprises residues 2–14, whereas in the conformation D, the helix comprises residues 2–8. Conformation E is the more stable below 300 K while D is more stable above this temperature. Amino acid Lys14 is located at the end of α-helix 1 in the E conformation and at a helical turn between α-helices 1 and 2 in the D conformation. Lys7, Arg20, and Lys34, all three of which remain accessible to proteolysis in the absence or presence of metal ions, are found on α-helices 1, 2, and 3, respectively (see Fig. 9). Helices 2 and 3 are maintained in the D and E conformations of the N terminus (8Cai M. Zheng R. Caffrey M. Craigie R. Clore M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Similarly, the first 8 residues of α-helix 1 do not undergo appreciable structural changes in either conformation. On the basis of the NMR structures, residues Gln9 to Asn18 are most susceptible to conformational changes. Therefore, it may not be surprising that the region of the N terminus, which includes Lys14 is affected by the conformational change induced in HIV-1 IN by binding of the metal cofactor to the D,D(35)E motif. We hypothesize that the metal-induced conformational change in the protein may contribute to the induction of the more stable E conformation of the N-terminal domain for catalysis.The regions encompassed by peptides j and c(residues 137–156 and 161–173, respectively) in the catalytic core domain become less accessible in the more catalytically active metal-induced conformation of HIV-1 IN. The fact that peptidej spans the extended loop that includes the active site residue Glu152 and that peptide c is also in proximity to the active site reflects a general flexibility in this region of the apoprotein (Fig. 10). This result is consistent with the high temperature factors observed for this region in the crystal structure of the apocore domain of HIV-1 IN (19Dyda F. Hickman A.B. Jenkins T.M. Engelman A. Craigie R. Davies D.R. Science. 1994; 266: 1981-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 20Goldgur Y. Dyda F. Hickman A.B. Jenkins T.J. Craigie R. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1998; 95: 9150-9154Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the coordination of metal ion(s) by the residues of the D,D(35)E motif reorganizes and stabilizes this region. Additional support for this view is provided by our previous findings, which showed that the epitope of a monoclonal antibody, mAb 4, which includes this flexible region in the core domain, is not recognized in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays at Mn2+ ion concentrations used in these studies (25Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16196-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).In the C terminus, Lys258 in the SH3-like domain becomes sensitive to trypsin digestion upon metal binding to the active site at the same time that Lys273 becomes resistant (Fig. 9). This suggests that the tail region (residues 274–288) becomes shielded from proteolysis as a consequence of the conformational change. Using cross-linking methodology, Heuer and Brown (34Heuer T.S. Brown P.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10655-10665Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) have identified regions in the C terminus, including the tail, that interact with the substrate DNA. Thus, the metal-induced change that affects the C-terminal tail seems likely to have a role in catalysis. 4E. Asante-Appiah and A. M. Skalka, submitted for publication. The location of Lys258 on the presumed DNA binding surface of the SH3-like domain (22Lodi P.J. Ernst J.A. Kuszewski J. Hickman A.B. Engelman A. Craigie R. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9826-9833Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 23Eijkelenboom A.P.A.M. Puras-Lutzke R. Boelens R. Plasterk R.H.A. Kaptien R. Hürd K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) allows us to speculate that changes in this region may lead to reorganization of the DNA binding domain and that this may also be important for catalysis.What do these observed metal-induced conformational changes reveal about the mechanism of catalysis? The results reported here indicate that the conserved residues of the D,D(35)E motif mediate both catalytic activity and conformational change. Amino acids Lys156 and Lys159 in the core domain of HIV-1 IN have recently been implicated in specific binding of substrate DNA (36Jenkins T.M. Esposito D. Engelman A. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6849-6859Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The region that includes Lys258 has also been implicated in sequence-independent DNA interactions that may involve the target host DNA (37Puras-Lutzke R.A. Vink C. Plasterk R.H.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4125-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that a metal-induced conformational change activates HIV-1 IN and that blocking the structural change abolishes catalytic activity (25Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16196-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Results reported here indicate that the structures of regions that include both the metal-binding and substrate-binding residues are altered upon binding of the required metal cofactor. It seems likely that the restructuring of these regions produces a conformation that can interact more productively with the substrate DNA. We suggest that the stabilization of the N-terminal α-helix 1, the organization of the substrate-binding basic residues in the C-terminal SH3-like domain, and ordering of the metal-coordinating residues of the D,D(35)E motif and the extended loop (Fig. 10) may all contribute to the enhanced specific activity associated with the preincubation of HIV-1 IN with metal ions (25Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16196-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 31Vink C. Gronenger A.A.M.O. Plasterk R.H.A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3320-3326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).

Stable transfectants in rat PC12 cells showed distinct differences in the two classes of mutations. The cells containing TM mutants displayed normal expression and activation but higher responsiveness to lower doses of ligand. The KD mutants showed significantly altered expression patterns. Normal amounts of a lowerM r receptor (p130) reflecting incomplete glycosylation, but only greatly decreased amounts of the mature (p170) form, were observed. However, the latter material showed normal ligand-dependent activation. In contrast, the p130 form, which is regularly observed in the expression of both native and chimeric receptors, exhibits strong ligand-independent tyrosine phosphorylation, particularly with the K650E mutation. Expression of two of the KD mutants (K650M and K650E), under control of an inducible metallothionein promoter, indicated that this receptor was sufficiently autoactivated to produce at least partial differentiation and, in the case of the K650E mutation, to induce ligand-independent neurite outgrowth. A model is presented that suggests that the lowM r (p130) KD mutants can, under the right conditions, signal intracellularly, but when they are fully glycosylated and move to the cell surface they adopt a normal, inhibited conformation, in the form of ligand-independent dimers, that neutralizes the effects of the mutations. When ligands bind, these dimeric receptors are activated in a normal manner. This model suggests that unliganded dimers may be a common intermediate in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling.

One of these, Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans, is caused by a TM domain mutation in FGFR3 (A391E) in close proximity to the common ACH mutation (G380R) (25Meyers G.A. Orlow S.J. Munro I.R.

Recent studies suggest that FGFR3 is a negative regulator of bone growth (29Colvin J.S. Bohne B.A. Harding G.W. McEwen D.G. Ornitz D.M. Nat.

Consistent with this view, a gradient of ligand-independent activity of chimeric and full-length FGFR2 and FGFR3, corresponding to the severity of the mutation, has been observed (31Galvin B.D.

Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), alternatively, support a dosage-dependent dominant-negative effect from specific mutant FGFR3 alleles resulting in a disruption of FGFR signaling. Inherent in several of these studies are complications arising from potential interactions with endogenous FGFR receptors that may alter subsequent signaling. To clarify further the signaling properties of receptors with these mutations, we have recently described a chimeric receptor (PFR3), consisting of the five immunoglobulin (Ig)-loop extracellular domain of hPDGFR and the TM and intracellular domains of hFGFR3 (40Thompson L.M. Raffioni S. Wasmuth J.J. Bradshaw R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4169-4177Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). When stably transfected into PC12 cells, which contain no endogenous PDGFRβ, this chimera can be specifically activated by PDGF to signal through the altered FGFR3 intracellular domain. A mutation that causes ACH, G375C, was introduced by in vitro mutagenesis into the coding region of PFR3, and the biological effects of this mutation on signal transduction in PC12 cells were determined. In this report, we extend these studies to examine the differences in two classes of FGFR3 skeletal dysplasia mutations, those within the TM domain and those within the KD domain. Construction of hPFR3 (human PDGFRβ-FGFR3) and of PFR3G375C has been described previously (40Thompson L.M. Raffioni S. Wasmuth J.J. Bradshaw R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4169-4177Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). hPFR3 cloned into pCMV-1 was used as a template for in vitro mutagenesis (CLONTECH Transformer Mutagenesis Kit) following the manufacturer's instructions. Mutagenic primers to create the relevant mutations are as follows: G380R, 5′-AGCTACAGGGTGGGCTTCTTCCTGTTC-3′; N540K, 5′-CATCATCAAGCTGCTGGGCGCCTGC-3′; K650E, 5′-CTACTACAAGGAGAC- AACCAACGGC-3′; K650M, 5′-CTACTACAAGATGACAACCAACGGC-3′; and A391E, 5′-TTCATCCTGGTGGTGGAGGCTGTGAC-3′. Each mutation generated within PFR3 was verified by double-stranded DNA sequencing using Sequenase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with gene-specific primers. The cDNA constructs were transiently transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells (ATCC CRL 1573) by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique to check the size and activity of the expressed chimera (41Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). PFR3 constructs were subsequently subcloned into the EcoRI site of the retroviral vector pLEN (7Obermeier A. Bradshaw R.A. Seedorf K. Choidas A. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) for constitutive expression or into the NotI site of pMTCB6+ (kindly provided by F. Rauscher) usingNotI linkers for inducible expression. Chimeric receptors in pLEN, containing each of the FGFR3 mutations (Fig. 1), were stably transfected into PC12 cells by retroviral infection as described previously (40Thompson L.M. Raffioni S. Wasmuth J.J. Bradshaw R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4169-4177Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Chimeric receptors in pMTCB6+ containing either the K650E, K650M, or no mutation were stably transfected into PC12 cells using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) per manufacturer's instructions. Transfectants were selected using G418 (Omega Scientific) beginning 24 h after transfection. PC12 cells were maintained in culture in 150-cm2 tissue culture flasks (Costar) in complete medium (DMEM containing 5% horse serum, 2.5% fetal calf serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution) at 37 oC in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. 293 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For neurite outgrowth assays, PC12 cells were plated in collagen-coated six-well plates (Falcon) in plasma-derived complete medium at a density of 105cells/well. After 16–24 h, the cells were rinsed and cultured in 1% plasma-derived horse serum in the presence of various concentrations of PDGF-BB (Austral Biologicals). Cells were examined for the presence of neurites at 24 and 48 h. Responsive cells were defined as those bearing neurites at least 2 cell diameters in length. Expression of chimeric receptors stably transfected in PC12 cells under the control of the ovine metallothionein (MT) promoter in pMTCB6+ were induced by the addition of 80 μm ZnSO4 for 24 h. Expression was monitored by Western blot analysis. PC12 clonal cell lines expressing chimeras or mock-infected cells were grown in plasma-derived complete medium in either 100- or 150 mm2collagen-coated culture dishes until 60–70% confluency was reached. The cells were starved for at least 24 h in DMEM containing 0.2% plasma-derived horse serum and then treated with different concentrations of PDGF-BB at 37 °C. Cells were lysed as described previously (40Thompson L.M. Raffioni S. Wasmuth J.J. Bradshaw R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4169-4177Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and protein concentration was determined with the Bradford colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad). For PLCγ coprecipitation experiments, a Nonidet P-40 association buffer was used for cell lysis (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)). Immunoprecipitates were washed 1 time in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm PMSF, once in the same buffer containing 0.25% Nonidet P-40, and twice in the same buffer with 0.1% Nonidet P-40. All other immunoprecipitations and Western blot analysis have been described previously (40Thompson L.M. Raffioni S. Wasmuth J.J. Bradshaw R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4169-4177Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used throughout these studies: mouse monoclonal anti-hPDGFRβ for immunoprecipitations (Genzyme) and for immunoblotting (Austral Biologicals); rabbit polyclonal anti-FGFR3, anti-PLCγ, and anti-SOS (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rabbit polyclonal anti-Shc and mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.); mouse monoclonal anti-Grb2 (Transduction Laboratories); and rabbit anti-phospho-MAPK antiserum (Promega). For precipitation studies to detect FRS2 and FRS2-binding proteins, P13suc agarose (Oncogene Science) was used. PC12 cells were plated in 100-mm dishes and stimulated for 5 min with PDGF-BB. Cells were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 20 min in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (1% w/v), 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 40 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 200 mm sodium orthovanadate with 1 mm PMSF, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and to the supernatant was added 10 μl of agarose-conjugated anti-Erk1 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and incubated with gentle rocking at 4 °C for 3 h. Agarose beads were washed 3 times in lysis buffer and once in kinase buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate). Agarose beads were washed 3 times in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 2 mg/ml myelin basic protein as substrate, 50 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P{rsqb]ATP. Kinase reactions were performed for 10 min at 30 °C and stopped by adding 40 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min and separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and exposed overnight with intensifying screens. Bands were excised from the gel, and radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation. Mutations corresponding to the amino acid substitutions in FGFR3, which cause ACH (G375C, G380R), HCH (N540K), TD types I (K650M) and II (K650E), and Crouzon syndrome (A391E), as well as a kinase-inactive control (K508M), were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into the PFR3 chimera (Fig. 1). Expression of these mutant receptors was initially monitored by transiently transfecting each construct into human embryonic kidney 293 cells and analyzing receptor protein levels on Western blots. As is normally observed in RTK expression, each PFR3 construct was present as two immunoreactive bands of the expected sizes of 170 (mature) and 130 (immature) kDa, when immunoprecipitated with anti-PDGFR and detected with anti-FGFR3 antibodies (data not shown). The same PFR3 constructs were also stably transfected into PC12 cells, and individual clones were selected and frozen for future analysis. The experiments described herein utilized pools of transfected cell lines in order to provide a range of receptor expression. To determine autophosphorylation levels of the stably transfected receptors in PC12 cells, protein lysates from pools of different transfected lines were immunoprecipitated with anti-hPDGFR and analyzed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. As shown in Fig.2 A, the chimeric receptors displayed increased levels of autophosphorylation upon stimulation with ligand, the amount of phosphorylation being dependent upon receptor levels and mutation type (Fig. 2, B and C). PFR3, PFR3G375C, PFR3G380R, and PFR3A391Eeach showed comparable levels of ligand-responsive tyrosine phosphorylation when normalized for the amount of receptor expressed (Fig. 2, B and C). It has been demonstrated previously for both PFR1 and PFR3 (40Thompson L.M. Raffioni S. Wasmuth J.J. Bradshaw R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4169-4177Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 42Foehr E.D. Raffioni S. Fujii R. Bradshaw R.A. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1998; (in press): 76Google Scholar) that overexpression of receptor protein leads to some ligand-independent phosphorylation with the degree of independence correlating with the level of receptor expression. This phenomenon was consistently observed with these mutants as well. In contrast to the TM mutants, all three of the KD mutants, PFR3N540K, PFR3K650E and PFR3K650M, show low levels of mature receptor expression. For both the chimeric PFR3 constructs, as well as full-length FGFR3 clones (data not shown), there are two immunoreactive receptor bands observed. The upper band (approximately 170 kDa for PFR3), normally the more abundant of the two, represents the species that becomes phosphorylated, whereas the lower band (approximately 130 kDa) is normally not phosphorylated.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13007-13014Google Scholar), the upper band likely represents the mature, glycosylated form, and the lower is a less glycosylated precursor species. Mutations within the tyrosine kinase domain of the chimeric receptors, N540K, K650E, and K650M, result in a severe reduction of the 170-kDa immunoreactive protein, as judged by anti-PDGFR (Fig. 2 B) or anti-FGFR3 (Fig. 2 C) Western blotting. In addition, the lower 130-kDa band of PFR3K650E and to a lesser extent PFR3N540K(Fig. 4 A shows a darker exposure of Fig. 2 A) were autophosphorylated in a ligand-independent manner, a novel modification that may represent a new active form of the receptor. Nonetheless, the low levels of p170 expressed for the KD mutants were clearly ligand activable and produced, relative to the amount of receptor protein present, a strong autophosphorylation response. Specifically, expression levels of PFR3 with N540K and K650E mutations are decreased by approximately 2-fold that of wild type, and expression of K650M is barely visible by Western blot analysis. In contrast, the N540K, K650E, and K650M mutations produce approximately a 1.5-, 2-, and 3-fold reduction, respectively, in ligand-dependent phosphorylation of the p170 form when compared with wild type. It is important to note that only those cell lines that express these low levels of receptor could be selected; those expressing high levels were apparently terminally differentiated, a condition that precludes their selection with the G418 screen (see below). Ligand-dependent or -independent phosphorylation was not observed in cells containing inactive PFR3K508M. PC12 cell lines, stably transfected with the various mutant PFR3 constructs, were stimulated with various concentrations of PDGF, and biological responses were monitored at 24 or 48 h following addition of ligand. As shown previously, PDGFR chimeras of TrkA, the nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor (7Obermeier A. Bradshaw R.A. Seedorf K. Choidas A. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), 2E. D. Foehr, A. Tatavos, E. Tanabe, S. Raffioni, S. Goetz, E. DiMarco, M. DeLuca, and R. A. Bradshaw, submitted for publication. and FGFR1 (42Foehr E.D. Raffioni S. Fujii R. Bradshaw R.A. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1998; (in press): 76Google Scholar), when stably transfected into PC12 cells, produced the same ligand (PDGF)-dependent differentiation, characterized by the growth of neuronal processes, as induced in native PC12 cells by NGF and FGF (45Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Adv. Cell Neurobiol. 1982; 3: 373-415Crossref Google Scholar). Neurite outgrowth was observed for all PFR3-containing cell lines, albeit to varying degrees (Fig.3). At 24 h (data not shown), both ACH mutant-containing lines, PFR3G380R and PFR3G375C, are the most rapidly responsive, with over 70% of the cells producing neurites at 30 ng/ml PDGF. PFR3 (wild type) and the A391E mutant show comparable levels of response with 50–60% neurite outgrowth, respectively. With PFR3N540K- and PFR3K650M-containing cells, 40 and 30% of the cells, respectively, produced neurites at the same time point. PC12 cells containing PFR3K650E showed very little neurite outgrowth (10%) by 24 h. By 48 h, a larger proportion of all cell lines produced neurites (Fig. 3). At this point, the two ACH mutant-containing cells, PFR3G375C and PFR3G380R, are almost completely differentiated (90 and 80%, respectively), and PFR3- and PFR3A391E-containing cells show very similar responsiveness to 30 ng/ml ligand (approximately 70%). PFR3N540K (50%) and PFR3K650M (45%), both KD mutants, have decreased maximal ligand responsiveness compared with control and TM domain mutants, whereas PFR3K650E showed the least amount of responsiveness for any of the mutant chimeras (less than 20%). In addition, both PFR3G375C and PFR3G380R, and to some degree PFR3A391E, require less ligand to produce neurites. At 1 ng/ml PDGF, a proportion of both ACH mutant-containing (10%) and, to a lesser extent, the Crouzon mutant-containing (5%) cell lines, are responsive compared with wild type or KD mutant-containing cell lines. It should be noted that the PFR3G375C-containing cell line (40Thompson L.M. Raffioni S. Wasmuth J.J. Bradshaw R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4169-4177Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) is clonal, i.e. it was derived from a single PC12 cell, which may explain the slightly higher maximum responsiveness than the pooled cell lines. No neurites were formed by cells containing the kinase-inactive receptor (PFR3K508M). Activation of PFR3, like other receptor tyrosine kinases, leads to phosphorylation and stimulation of downstream target proteins/effectors (40Thompson L.M. Raffioni S. Wasmuth J.J. Bradshaw R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4169-4177Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 44Kunai M. Goke M. Tsunekawa S. Podolsky D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13007-13014Google Scholar).

These mutations were introduced into the rat LHR (rLHR) and are designated L435R and D556Y. Cells expressing rLHR-D556Y bind human choriogonadotropin (hCG) with normal affinity, exhibit a 25-fold increase in basal cAMP and respond to hCG with a normal increase in cAMP accumulation. This mutation does not affect the internalization of the free receptor, but it enhances the internalization of the agonist-occupied receptors ∼3-fold. Cells expressing rLHR-L435R also bind hCG with normal affinity, exhibit a 47-fold increase in basal cAMP, and do not respond to hCG with a further increase in cAMP accumulation. This mutation enhances the internalization of the free and agonist-occupied receptors ∼2- and ∼17-fold, respectively. We conclude that the state of activation of the rLHR can modulate its basal and/or agonist-stimulated internalization.Since the internalization of hCG is involved in the termination of hCG actions, we suggest that the lack of responsiveness detected in cells expressing rLHR-L435R is due to the fast rate of internalization of the bound hCG. The finding that membranes expressing rLHR-L435R (a system where internalization does not occur) respond to hCG with an increase in adenylyl cyclase activity supports this suggestion.

The lutropin/choriogonadotropin receptor (LHR) 1The abbreviations used are: LHR, lutropin/choriogonadotropin receptor; rLHR, rat LHR; hLHR, human LHR; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; CG, choriogonadotropin; hCG, human CG; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. is a member of the rhodopsin-like subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (reviewed in Ref. 1Segaloff D.L. Ascoli M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 324-347PubMed Google Scholar) that has been shown to mediate the internalization of its two naturally occurring agonists, lutropin and choriogonadotropin (CG). These studies, which have been conducted in target or transfected cells, have shown that the free LHR is randomly distributed in the plasma membrane, but that it clusters in clathrin-coated pits upon agonist activation (2Ghinea N. Vuhai M.T. Groyer-Picard M.-T. Houllier A. Schoëvaërt D. Milgrom E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1347-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The clustered agonist-receptor complex is internalized by a dynamin-dependent pathway and traverses the endosomal compartment without agonist dissociation (3Lazari M.de F.M. Bertrand J.E. Nakamura K.

Dissociation of the agonist-receptor complex occurs in the lysosomes, where both the agonist and the receptor are degraded (2Ghinea N. Vuhai M.T. Groyer-Picard M.-T. Houllier A. Schoëvaërt D. Milgrom E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1347-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 4Ascoli M. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1242-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 5Ascoli M.

The receptor-mediated endocytosis of lutropin and CG serves two important functions in regulating cellular responsiveness. First, the internalization of the receptor-bound agonist effectively stops activation of downstream effectors such as adenylyl cyclase (7Segaloff D.L. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11420-11423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the accumulation of the agonist-receptor complex in the lysosomes promotes receptor degradation and is ultimately responsible for the agonist-induced down-regulation of the cell surface LHR, an outcome that prevents further activation of the cells (4Ascoli M. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1242-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 8Lloyd C.E. Ascoli M. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 9Wang H. Segaloff D.L. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 780-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lysosomal accumulation of the rLHR-agonist complex and the involvement of rLHR internalization in the termination of hormone action (i.e. desensitization) place the LHR in an unusual subgroup of GPCRs. Thus, the majority of internalized GPCRs recycle back to the plasma membrane instead of being routed to the lysosomes, and internalization is thought to play an important role in receptor resensitization rather than desensitization (10Zhang J. Barak L.S. Winkler K.E. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27005-27014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 11Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev.

Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Another notable difference between the LHR and other GPCRs is on the rate of internalization. The t 12 of internalization of most GPCRs that are internalized by a nonvisual arrestin/clathrin/dynamin-dependent pathway is 10–15 min (11Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar, 12Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Sairam M.R. Ascoli M. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2837-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and 100–140 min in 293 cells expressing the recombinant rLHR (3Lazari M.de F.M. Bertrand J.E.

It is not known if this slower rate of internalization of the rLHR-agonist complex is a reflection of a weak interaction of the rLHR with the nonvisual arrestins or if it is due to the involvement of other adapter proteins (see Ref. 3Lazari M.de F.M.

Recent studies conducted with several members of the rhodopsin-like subfamily of GPCRs, including the LHR, have led to the suggestion that the same active conformation of GPCRs is involved in the stimulation of G proteins and the endocytosis of the receptor. For example, when occupied by weak partial agonists or antagonists, the mouse LHR (13Hoelscher S.R. Sairam M.R. Ascoli M. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2837-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and the β2-adrenergic receptor (16von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18448-18452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are internalized at much slower rates than when occupied by agonists. It is also known that the slower internalization of the LHR induced by a weak partial agonist is not due to the reduced levels of cAMP, because the addition of cAMP analogs does not increase the rate of internalization of the weak partial agonist (13Hoelscher S.R. Sairam M.R. Ascoli M. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2837-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Moreover, the LHR-mediated internalization of hCG is normal in a cell line that expresses a cAMP-resistant phenotype (13Hoelscher S.R. Sairam M.R. Ascoli M. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2837-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). More recent experiments conducted with several agonists of the m3 muscarinic receptor have shown that there is a linear correlation between their intrinsic agonistic activity and their rate of endocytosis (17Szekers P.G. Koenig J.A. Edwardson J.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 759-765Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Likewise, point mutations of the rat LHR (rLHR) (14Dhanwada K.R. Vijapurkar U. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 544-554PubMed Google Scholar) or the β2-adrenergic receptor (18Barak L.S. Menard L. Ferguson S.S.G. Colaprieto A.-M. Caron M.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15407-15414Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) that impair signal transduction also impair endocytosis of their respective agonists. Universal statements about agonist-induced activation and endocytosis of GPCRs cannot be made, however, because there are point mutations of some GPCRs such as the β2-adrenergic receptor (19Cheung A.H. Dixon R.A.F. Hill W.S. Sigal I.S. Strader C.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 775-779PubMed Google Scholar) and the AT1A receptor (20Hunyady L. Baukal A.J. Balla T. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24798-24804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that impair signal transduction without affecting endocytosis. Last, three potent agonists of the μ-opioid receptor (enkephalin, etorphine, and morphine) can readily stimulate signal transduction, but only two of them (enkephalin and etorphine) stimulate receptor internalization (21Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Kang L. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19021-19024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Since the use of a weak partial agonist and signaling-impairing mutations of the LHR have established that impairments in signal transduction slow down the endocytosis of this receptor (13Hoelscher S.R. Sairam M.R. Ascoli M. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2837-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 14Dhanwada K.R. Vijapurkar U. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 544-554PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that mutations of the LHR that make it constitutively active should enhance endocytosis. The experiments described herein take advantage of two activating mutations of the LHR associated with human disease (22Laue L. Chan W.-Y. Hsueh A.J.W. Kudo M. Hsu S.Y. Wu S.-M. Blomberg L.

Bilerbeck A.E. Segaloff D.L. Mendonica B.B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 2435-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) to examine this hypothesis. The cloning of the rat luteal lutropin/CG receptor cDNA and the template plasmid containing the full-length coding region plus portions of the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of the wild-type rLHR cDNA have been previously described (24McFarland K.C. Sprengel R. Phillips H.S. Kohler M. Rosemblit N. Nikolics K. Segaloff D.L. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1989; 245: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). The preparation and characterization of myc-rLHR-wt, a modified form of the rLHR containing the myc epitope at the N terminus has also been described (25Fabritz J. Ryan S. Ascoli M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 664-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Point mutations were introduced using PCR strategies, and the sequence of the entire region of each mutant cDNA generated by PCR was verified by automated DNA sequencing. The mutant and wild-type rLHR cDNAs were subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNAI/Neo (Invitrogen) for transfection. Transfections of human embryonic kidney (293) cells were done using calcium phosphate as described by Chen and Okayama (26Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). Cells plated in 100-mm dishes were transfected when 70–80% confluent using 10 μg of each plasmid. After an overnight incubation, the cells were washed and they were placed back in culture medium for 24 h. The cells were then trypsinized, plated at low densities in 100-mm dishes, and selected using 700 μg/ml G418. Stably transfected cell lines were obtained following G418 selection and cloning as described elsewhere (14Dhanwada K.R. Vijapurkar U. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 544-554PubMed Google Scholar, 27Hipkin R.W. Wang Z. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 151-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The establishment and properties of a clonal cell lines expressing rLHR-wt (designated 293L(wt-12)) and a clonal cell line expressingmyc-rLHR-wt (designated 293Lmyc(wt-11)) have been described (15Wang Z. Liu X. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 25Fabritz J. Ryan S. Ascoli M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 664-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 28Wang Z. Hipkin R.W. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 748-759PubMed Google Scholar). Equilibrium binding parameters for hCG were measured during an overnight incubation (4 °C) of intact cells with seven different concentrations of125I-hCG (27Hipkin R.W. Wang Z. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 151-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Wang Z. Hipkin R.W. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 748-759PubMed Google Scholar). Concentration-response curves for the hCG-induced increases in cAMP accumulation were obtained by measuring total cAMP levels in cells that had been incubated with at least five different concentrations of hCG for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. The different parameters that describe the binding or concentration response curves were calculated as described elsewhere (27Hipkin R.W. Wang Z. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 151-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Wang Z. Hipkin R.W. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 748-759PubMed Google Scholar). The methods used for the isolation of membranes and adenylyl cyclase assays have also been described (29Abell A.M. Segaloff D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14586-14591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The endocytosis of125I-hCG was measured as follows (5Ascoli M. Segaloff D.L. Endocrinology. 1987; 120: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 8Lloyd C.E. Ascoli M. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Cells, plated in 35-mm wells, were preincubated in 1 ml of Waymouth's MB752/1 containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, for 60 min. at 37 °C. Each well then received 40 ng/ml125I-hCG, and the incubation was continued at 37 °C. Groups of cells were placed on ice at 5–10-min intervals and washed twice with 2-ml aliquots of cold Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The surface-bound hormone was then released by incubating the cells in 1 ml of cold 50 mmglycine, 150 mm NaCl, pH 3 for 2–4 min (6Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13306-13311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The acidic buffer was removed, and the cells were washed once more with another aliquot of the same buffer. The acid buffer washes were combined and counted, and the cells were solubilized with 100 μl of 0.5n NaOH, collected with a cotton swab, and counted to determine the amount of internalized hormone. At least five different data points collected at 5–10-min intervals were used in each experiment, and the endocytotic rate constant (k e) was calculated from the slope of the line obtained by plotting the internalized radioactivity against the integral of the surface-bound radioactivity (30Wiley H.S. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4222-4229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The half-life of internalization (t 12) is defined as 0.693/k e. Since proteolysis of intact cells under mild conditions has been shown to destroy the cell surface rLHR (25Fabritz J. Ryan S. Ascoli M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 664-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the rate constant for internalization of the free rLHR can be measured by following the time course of recovery of 125I-hCG binding to the cell surface as a function of time after removal of the protease (31Berlin C.M. Schimke R.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1965; 1: 149-156PubMed Google Scholar). Cells (plated in 100-mm dishes) were placed on ice and washed twice with 4-ml portions of cold Hanks' balanced salt solution. The cell surface rLHR was then proteolyzed by incubating the cells on ice for 30–45 min in cold Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 250 μg/ml Protease type XIV (25Fabritz J. Ryan S. Ascoli M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 664-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Protease activity was quenched by the addition of 4 ml of Waymouth's MB752/1 medium supplemented with 20 mm Hepes, 15% horse serum, 1 mm phenylmethyl sulfonylfluoride, 2 mm EDTA, and 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide. The cells were then scraped from the plate and collected by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in the same medium, and the cells were collected by centrifugation again and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% new born calf serum, 20 mm Hepes, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, pH 7.4. The cells were then distributed into 35-mm wells and placed in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C to allow the cell surface rLHR to recover. At predetermined times (see Fig. 4), the cells were used for 125I-hCG binding assays (see above). The rate constant for internalization (k int) was calculated by a nonlinear fit of plots of 125I-hCG binding to intact cells versus time (cf. Fig. 4 and Equation 2). Nonlinear regressions were performed using the Delta Graph® software package. Cells were metabolically labeled in at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium modified to contain 20% of the normal amount of methionine and cysteine and supplemented with 1% newborn calf serum, 20 mm Hepes, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 100–200 μCi/ml Tran35S-label. Cell lysates were prepared at different times and, depending on the cell type used, the35S-labeled receptor was immunoprecipitated using antibodies raised against synthetic peptides derived from the rLHR-wt or an antibody (designated 9E10) directed against the mycepitope (25Fabritz J.

The rate constants for degradation (k deg) were calculated by a nonlinear fit of plots of the amount of radioactivity incorporated into the rLHR precursor versus time (cf. Equation 4). Nonlinear regressions were performed using the Delta Graph® software package. Purified hCG (CR-127) was obtained from the National Hormone and Pituitary Agency of the NIDDK, National Institutes of Health. 125I-hCG was prepared as described previously (35Ascoli M. Puett D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) to give a specific radioactivity of 25,000–30,000 cpm/ng. Nonidet P-40, sodium deoxycholate, protease inhibitors,N,N′,N“-triacetylchitotriose, protein A-agarose, bovine serum albumin, and protease type XIV were from Sigma. Wheat germ agglutinin agarose was from Vector Laboratories. Cell culture supplies and reagents were obtained from Corning and Life Technologies, Inc., respectively. Tran35S-label was from ICN. Human kidney 293 cells and the 9E10 hybridoma cell line were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. All other materials were obtained from commonly used suppliers. There are now a large number of activating mutations of the human LHR (hLHR) that have been found to be associated with gonadotropin-independent, male-limited precocious puberty (reviewed in Ref. 36Shenker A.

These two residues are fully conserved in the rLHR, and the corresponding mutants are designated rLRH-D556Y and rLHR-L435R. 2The equivalent mutations described in the hLHR are D578Y and L457R (22Laue L.

For comparative purposes, we also constructed and analyzed a Tyr to Phe mutation in TM5 (designated rLHR-Y524F), which is predicted to impair signaling of the rLHR. This prediction is based on the high degree of conservation of this residue among the rhodopsin-like subfamily of GPCRs (37Probst W.C. Snyder L.A. Schuster D.I. Brosius J. Sealfon S.C.

Rat LHR-Y524F and -D556Y were constructed in the context of the native rLHR sequence, while rLHR-435R was constructed in the context of the myc-tagged rLHR. Clonal lines of human kidney 293 cells stably expressing each of these constructs were established and tested for 125I-hCG binding. All mutant receptors bound hCG with an affinity comparable with that detected in cells expressing rLHR-wt (Table I). Cell lines expressing a density of about 100,000 cell surface receptors/cell were matched with previously established cell lines designated 293L(wt-12) and 293Lmyc(wt-11) expressing a comparable density of the native or myc-tagged rLHR-wt (15Wang Z.

The data presented in Table I and Fig. 1 also show a comparison of the basal and hCG-stimulated cAMP levels in the clonal lines expressing the wild type and mutant receptors.

We have pursued equilibrium binding experiments to examine the affinity of Ncd for microtubules in the presence of the ATP nonhydrolyzable analog 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP), ADP, or ADP + Pi using both dimeric (MC1) and monomeric (MC6) Ncd constructs expressed in Escherichia coli. Both MC1 and MC6 sediment with microtubules in the absence of added nucleotide as well as in the presence of either ADP or AMP-PNP. Yet, in the presence of ADP + Pi, there is a decrease in the affinity of both MC1 and MC6 for microtubules. The data for dimeric MC1 show that release of the dimer to the supernatant is sigmoidal with the apparentK d(Pi) for the two phosphate sites at 23.3 and 1.9 mm, respectively. The results indicate that binding at the first phosphate site enhances binding at the second site, thus cooperatively stimulating release. Stopped-flow kinetics indicate that MgATP promotes dissociation of the Mt·MC1 complex at 14 s−1, yet AMP-PNP has no effect on the Mt·MC1 complex. These results are consistent with a model for the ATPase cycle in which ATP hydrolysis occurs on the microtubule followed by detachment as the Ncd·ADP·Pi intermediate.

Cell. 1990; 61: 991-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Conventional kinesin, the founding member of this family, moves toward the plus end of neuronal microtubules, transporting membranous organelles from the cell body toward the synapse (3Bloom G.S. Endow S.A. Protein Profile. 1994; 1: 1059-1116PubMed Google Scholar, 4Vale R.D. Fletterick R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 745-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Ncd, on the other hand, is responsible for the microtubule movements required for spindle organization and maintenance during oogenesis and the early cleavages of the Drosophila melanogaster embryo (5Endow S.A.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, Ncd exhibits motility behavior that is quite different from that of kinesin even though the motor domains of kinesin and Ncd (∼320 amino acids) are remarkably similar both in amino acid sequence (∼40% identity) and three-dimensional structure (7Kull F.J.

For example, Ncd drives movement to the minus end of microtubules, yet kinesin promotes plus end-directed movement (10Walker R.A. Salmon E.D. Endow S.A.

In addition, the velocity of Ncd movement in microtubule gliding assays (100–230 nm/s) is slower than the movement reported for kinesin (500–800 nm/s) (12Vale R.D. Reese T.S. Sheetz M.P.

Although the motility of Ncd and kinesin appear to be quite different, recent kinetic studies to compare Ncd and kinesin have indicated there are similarities in the ATPase mechanism. For both Ncd and kinesin, ADP release is the rate-limiting step in the absence of microtubules, and microtubules directly and dramatically activate the dissociation of ADP from both kinesin and Ncd (21Shimizu T.

These preliminary studies have also shown that kinesin is a much faster ATPase than Ncd. Structural studies have also been pursued to compare the complexes produced by the interaction of either kinesin or Ncd with microtubules. These high resolution electron microscopic reconstructions have revealed important differences in the microtubule-motor complex that may provide insight into the mechanism of movement (24Arnal I.

For dimeric Ncd, both motor domains are clearly visible and are in direct contact with each other. However, one motor domain is bound to the microtubule with the second partner motor domain detached from the microtubule lattice and pointing toward the microtubule minus end (25Hirose K. Lockhart A.

Mandelkow E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In contrast, dimeric kinesin under similar experimental conditions shows a different three-dimensional image reconstruction and diffraction pattern (24Arnal I. Metoz F. DeBonis S. Wade R.H. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1265-1270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 25Hirose K. Lockhart A. Cross R.A. Amos L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The published data to date indicate that one motor domain is bound directly to the microtubule surface. However, the results for the partner motor domain are not as straightforward. It was originally proposed that the second head of kinesin was detached and only partially visible because of disorder (24Arnal I. Metoz F. DeBonis S. Wade R.H. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1265-1270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 25Hirose K. Lockhart A. Cross R.A. Amos L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9539-9544Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the authors proposed that the differences observed in the orientation of the second head of kinesin and Ncd reflected the difference in the mechanism of motility. Although Hoengeret al. (27Hoenger A. Sack S. Thormählen M. Marx A. Müller J. Gross H. Mandelkow E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) recently reported similar experimental results, they argued quite convincingly that the second motor domain was also bound to the microtubule requiring separation of the motor domains at the neck helices. Regardless of the interpretation of the diffraction patterns or image reconstructions, the position of the second motor domain of kinesin is very different from the second motor domain of Ncd, illustrating by another criterion a fundamental difference in these two motors. Therefore, comparative studies of kinesin and Ncd are important in determining mechanistic and structural features that are both common and different for unidirectional motor proteins such as actomyosin, kinesin, dynein, DNA helicases, and RNA and DNA polymerases. We have pursued kinetic and equilibrium binding experiments using both monomeric and dimeric constructs of Ncd in the presence of various nucleotides and nucleotide analogs. These studies examine the microtubule affinity of the different Ncd-nucleotide intermediates. From these data we can infer which Ncd intermediates are bound to the microtubule and which intermediates are dissociated from the microtubule during the ATPase cycle. Such studies have been undertaken for kinesin and Ncd in the past, and it has been well established that the analogs resembling the ATP intermediate, such as AMP-PNP, are tightly bound to the microtubule and that the ADP intermediate is more weakly bound (23Pechatnikova E. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30735-30740Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 29Crevel I.M.T.C. Lockhart A. Cross R.A. J. Mol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 9473-9482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, it has not been clearly established for Ncd which intermediate actually detaches from the microtubule during the ATPase cycle. We report here that in the absence of added nucleotide, in the presence of AMP-PNP, or in the presence of ADP, Ncd sediments with microtubules. Yet, in the presence of ADP plus phosphate, Ncd dissociates from microtubules as reported for kinesin (30Rosenfeld S.S. Rener B. Correia J.J. Mayo M.S. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9473-9482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and the dissociation from microtubules is cooperative for dimeric MC1. The kinetic and equilibrium binding results described below indicate that the formation of the N·ADP·Piintermediate weakens the affinity of the Ncd motor domain for the microtubule. We propose that it is this intermediate that detaches from the microtubule during the ATPase cycle.

MC1 protein expressed from the plasmid contains the N terminus 11 amino acids from bacteriophage T7 S10 protein (MASMTGGQQMG) followed by 2 linker residues (RD), and Leu209–Lys700 from MC1 as originally described (18Chandra R. Salmon E.D. Erickson H.P. Lockhart A. Endow S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9005-9013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The MC6 protein expressed from the plasmid contains no T7 S10 protein amino acids and is composed of Ncd amino acids Met333–Lys700 with amino acid residue 699 changed from aspartic acid to glycine as originally described (18Chandra R. Salmon E.D. Erickson H.P. Lockhart A. Endow S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9005-9013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both constructs were sequenced to confirm that the Ncd insertions were unaltered. MC1 and MC6 were expressed separately in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified as described with minor modifications (18Chandra R. Salmon E.D. Erickson H.P. Lockhart A. Endow S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9005-9013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration of purified Ncd was determined using the Bradford method (IgG or ovalbumin as standard), by measuring absorbance at 280 nm, and by measuring absorbance at 259 nm to determine the concentration of the stoichiometrically bound ADP (εADP = 15,400 m−1cm−1). The calculated extinction coefficient of MC1 is 29,240 m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm, based on 26,740 m−1 cm−1 contributed by 2 tryptophans (εTrp = 5,690 m−1cm−1) and 12 tyrosines (εTyr = 1,280m−1 cm−1) plus one ADP bound per active site (εADP at A 280 nm = 2,500 m−1 cm−1). The extinction coefficient for MC6 is 27,960 m−1cm−1 at 280 nm, based on 25,460m−1 cm−1 contributed by 2 tryptophans and 11 tyrosines plus one ADP bound per active site. For dimeric MC1, there is good agreement of the Ncd motor domain concentration based on the A 259 determination, the Bradford determination, and the active site concentration (31Moyer M.L. Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). TheA 280 measurement is significantly lower even when determined in the presence of 8 m urea to unfold the protein. In contrast, for monomeric MC6 the A 280measurement, the Bradford assay, and the active site determination are comparable, yet the A 259 measuring ADP concentration is significantly higher. Ncd concentrations reported are based on active site concentration. Microtubules were assembled from soluble tubulin (cold depolymerized and clarified by centrifugation) and stabilized with 20 μm taxol as described previously (32Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Steady state ATPase measurements were determined by following the hydrolysis of [α-32P]ATP to form [α-32P]ADP·Pi as described previously (32Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). All experiments were conducted on a Beckman Optima XLA analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with absorbance optics and an An60Ti rotor. Temperature was calibrated as described previously (33Correia J.J. Gilbert S.P. Moyer M.L. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4898-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. All experiments were conducted in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, with KOH, 5 mm Mgacetate, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Kacetate, 0.1 mmDTT, 5% sucrose including 50–100 μm MgATP, MgADP, or MgAMP-PNP as noted. The density of each buffer was measured in either a Mettler Paar DMA 02D or an Anton Parr DMA 5000 precision density meter and used accordingly. The average density value was 1.0199 at 24.7 °C. Buffer viscosity (average value 1.0858 at 24.7 °C) was measured in a Cannon-Manning semi-micro viscometer. The partial specific volume, υ, of each construct (MC1 = 0.7255; MC6 = 0.7266) was calculated by the method of Cohen and Edsall and included the effect of a single bound nucleotide molecule (34Perkins S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 35Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge1992: 90-125Google Scholar). Velocity data were analyzed using DCDT (36Stafford III, W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) as described (33Correia J.J. Gilbert S.P. Moyer M.L. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4898-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Velocity data were also analyzed with the newest version of SVEDBERG (version 5.01) which utilizes a modified Fujita-MacCosham function and allows direct fitting of the data to molecular weight (37Philo J.S. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 435-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). It had previously been shown that the molecular weight of samples that aggregate during sedimentation equilibrium can be reasonably estimated by these methods (30Rosenfeld S.S. Rener B. Correia J.J. Mayo M.S. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9473-9482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Equilibrium experiments were performed at 16,000 rpm for MC1 and 22,000, 30,000 and 32,000 rpm for MC6 in charcoal-filled epon six channel centerpieces. Data sets were fit individually or jointly with NONLIN (38Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar) to an appropriate association scheme. The sequence-derived molecular weights, including one bound nucleotide, correspond to the monomer, M1, in an association scheme. For fits to an association scheme, M1 was held at the correct value. For MC1 the molecular weight of an MC1·ADP complex is 57,789 or 115,578 for a dimer, and for MC6 the molecular weight of the MC6·ADP complex is 42,025. The best fit of sedimentation equilibrium data for MC6 is a singular monomeric species. For MC1 at room temperature, the continuous loss of material from the gradient and the presence of irreversible aggregates in the presence of AMP-PNP complicated estimates of aK d for dimerization (see “Results”). At 3.6 °C, the best fit of sedimentation equilibrium data is either a single dimeric species or a monomer-dimer model with aK d < 1.5 nm. Equilibrium binding experiments were performed at 25 °C in ATPase buffer at 25 mm Kacetate with all concentrations reported as final values after mixing. In the binding stoichiometry experiment (Fig. 6), 2 μm MC1 was incubated with taxol-stabilized microtubules (0–8 μm tubulin; 40 μm taxol) in a 220-μl reaction. For the experiments performed at constant tubulin concentration (Figs. 7 and 10), 2 μm MC1 or MC6 were incubated with taxol-stabilized microtubules (4 μmtubulin) for 15 min to preform the M·N complex. This complex was then incubated with one of the following nucleotides for an additional 30 min to allow the system to reach equilibrium: MgAMP-PNP, MgADP, or MgADP + potassium phosphate, pH 7.2. The 220-μl reaction mixture was then added to Ultra-Clear centrifuge tubes (Beckman Instruments, Palo, Alto, CA) and centrifuged in a Beckman Airfuge at 30 pounds/square inch (100,000 × g) for 30 min to separate free Ncd in the supernatant from Ncd which sediments with the microtubules. 110 μl of the supernatant were removed and combined with 28 μl of 5× Laemmli sample buffer. The remaining supernatant was removed and discarded. ATPase buffer (100 μl) was added to the tube without disturbing the pellet and then gently removed to wash away any residual supernatant. Subsequently, the pellet was resuspended in 55 μl of 5× sample buffer plus 220 μl of ATPase buffer (the original sample volume). The supernatant and pellet from each sample were boiled for 5 min, loaded at equal volume on an 8% acrylamide, 2 m urea SDS gel, and electrophoresed. To determine the concentrations of Ncd and tubulin in the supernatant and pellet, the Coomassie Blue-stained gels were analyzed using an Envisions ENV24Pro digital scanner (Envisions Solutions Technology, Burlingame, CA) and quantified using NIH Image version 1.60. MC1 and MC6 showed a linear increase in Coomassie Blue-staining intensity as a function of protein concentration loaded in the range of 0.025 to 12 μm protein.Figure 7Binding of MC1 dimer to microtubules in the presence of either AMP-PNP, ADP, ADP + Pi, and ADP + Kacetate. The figure shows images of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gels following sedimentation of Mt·MC1 (2 μm MC1; 4 μm tubulin) complex. The supernatant (S) and pellet (P) for each reaction were loaded consecutively with the concentration of nucleotide added indicated above each supernatant/pellet pair.

The binding stoichiometry of MC1 and microtubules (Fig. 6 B) was determined by plotting the data as the MC1 dimer concentration sedimenting with microtubules as a function of total microtubules (expressed as α,β-tubulin heterodimer concentration). The analysis assumes a single binding site on the microtubule for each MC1 dimer consistent with the image reconstruction data on the mode of interaction between Ncd and microtubules (25Hirose K.

The microtubule pelleting experiments cannot differentiate between both motor domains bound to the microtubule or a single motor domain bound with the partner domain detached; however, both motor domains bound to the microtubule is considered to be unlikely. Therefore, the data were fit to the quadratic Equation 1. [Mt·N]=((N0+Mt0+Kd)−((N0+Mt0+Kd)2−4N0Mt0)1/2)/2Equation 1 where Mt·Nis the concentration of MC1 dimer bound to the microtubule; N 0 is the total MC1 dimer concentration; Mt 0 is total tubulin concentration, and K d is the dissociation constant. The Mt·Ncomplex was also plotted as a function of free microtubules not in complex with MC1 and fit to a hyperbola shown in Equation 2. [Mt·N]=[N][Mf]/(Kd+Mf)Equation 2 where N is the maximum concentration of MC1 dimer that sediments with microtubules; M f is the concentration of free tubulin not in complex with Ncd, andK d is the the apparent dissociation constant. Both methods of fitting the data provide approximately equivalent constants for K d and binding stoichiometry although Equation 1provides a better fit to the data. The MC1·ADP·Pi equilibrium binding results shown in Fig. 8 A were initially fit to the Hill equation to estimate the degree of cooperativity in ligand (Pi) binding (see Equation 3). Ys=[Pi]n/(Kh+[Pi]n)Equation 3 where Y s is the fraction of MC1 partitioning to the supernatant; Pi is the concentration of potassium phosphate; K h is the product of theK d values of the cooperative sites; and nis the Hill coefficient which provides an estimate of the number of cooperative sites. The data were also fit to a model assuming two stepwise binding reactions for phosphate with the association constantsK 1 and K 2. The reactions have been simplified showing only the binding of ligand Pi, although it is assumed that phosphate binds the N·ADP intermediate rather than free N (see Equations 4 and 5). N+Pi⇄N·PiK1=[N·Pi]/[N][Pi]Equation 4 N·Pi+Pi⇄Pi·N·PiK2=[Pi·N·Pi]/[N·Pi][Pi]Equation 5 Fractional partitioning (Y s) to the supernatant assumes that both motor domains are detached from the microtubule as N·ADP·Pi intermediate and can be defined as shown in Equation 6. Ys=[Pi·N·Pi]/[N]+[N·Pi]+[Pi·N·Pi]Equation 6 and using Equations Equation 4, Equation 5, Equation 6, fractional partitioning to the supernatant is as shown in Equation 7. Ys=K1K2[Pi]2/(1+K1[Pi]+K1K2[Pi]2)Equation 7 Data in Fig. 8 B were plotted as the fraction of MC1 partitioning to the supernatant as a function of MgADP concentration and fit to the function shown in Equation 8.

https://openalex.org/W2035251713,"Apolipoprotein (apo) B100 is an atypical secretory protein in that its translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane is inefficient, resulting in the partial translocation and exposure of apoB100 on the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum. Cytosolic exposure leads to the association of nascent apoB with heat shock protein 70 and to its predisposition to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. The basis for the inefficient translocation of apoB100 remains unclear and controversial. To test the hypothesis that β sheet domains present in apoB100 contribute to its inefficient translocation, we created human apoB chimeric constructs apoB13,16 and apoB13,13,16, which contain amino-terminal α globular domains but no β sheet domains, and apoB13,16,β, which has an amphipathic β sheet domain of apoB100 inserted into apoB13,16. These constructs, along with carboxyl-terminal truncations of apoB100, apoB34 and apoB42, were used to transfect HepG2 and Chinese hamster ovary cells. In contrast to the lack of effect of proteinase K on apoB13,16 and apoB13,13,16, the levels of apoB34, apoB42, and apoB13,16,β were decreased by 70–85% after proteinase K-induced proteolysis in both HepG2 and Chinese hamster ovary cells. Either oleic acid or proteasomal inhibitors (N-acetyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-norleucinal and lactacystin) significantly increased the cell levels of apoB13,16,β, apoB34, apoB42, and full-length apoB100 but had no effect on the cell levels of apoB13,16 and apoB13,13,16. When HepG2 cells were incubated with a microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor, the cellular levels of apoB13,16,β, apoB34, and apoB42 were decreased by 70–80%, whereas the levels of apoB13,16 and apoB13,13,16 were unaffected. The effects of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibition were reversed by lactacystin. Our results clearly demonstrate that the translocation efficiency, susceptibility to proteasomal degradation, and lipid responsiveness of apoB were determined by the presence of a lipid binding β sheet domain. It is possible that β sheet domains may at least transiently facilitate the interaction of apoB with the lipid bilayer surrounding the translocation channel.

B100 is the major protein of atherogenic very low density and low density lipoproteins (1Steinberg D. Carew T.E. Fielding C. Fogelman A.M. Mahley R.W. Sniderman A.D. Zilversmit D.B.

There is a wide range of apoB100 secretion from the liver in humans, and overproduction of very low density lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein is a common feature of human dyslipidemia (2Ginsberg H.N. Diabetes Care. 1991; 14: 839-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). ApoB100 is a constitutively synthesized protein (3Pullinger C.R. North J.D. Teng B.B. Rifici V.A. Ronhild de Brito A.E.

ApoB100 contains 4536 amino acids and is predicted to be comprised of three amphipathic α helix domains and two amphipathic β sheet domains (22Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Mishra V.K. Anantharamaiah G.M.

One of the β sheet domains is located between amino acids at about 18 and 43% of full-length apoB100 and may participate in apoB100 translocation arrest by a hydrophobic interaction with the ER membrane (23Thrift R.N.

To directly test the hypothesis that β sheet domains determine apoB100 translocation efficiency, we created human apoB chimeric constructs containing repeats of the first 13–16% of full-length apoB100. These constructs, apoB13,16 and apoB13,13,16, contain the amino-terminal α globular domains of apoB100, but no β sheet domains. These constructs were equal in length to the first 29 and 42% of apoB100, respectively. We also constructed apoB13,16,β in which the amphipathic β sheet domain situated between 28 and 34% of full-length apoB100 was inserted into apoB13,16 at either 9.5% of the construct or at 22.5% of the construct. The length of the apoB13,16,β constructs was equal to 35% of full-length apoB100. The efficiency of translocation, susceptibility to proteasomal degradation, responsiveness to oleic acid (OA) treatment, and sensitivity to the inhibition of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) activity of these chimeric proteins were compared with the same properties for full-length apoB100 and for the carboxyl-terminal truncations apoB34 and apoB42 in HepG2 and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Our results demonstrate that the presence of a β sheet domain near the amino-terminal of apoB100 is necessary and sufficient to cause the inefficient translocation of at least the first 42% of this atypical secretory protein. N-Acetyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN), OA, Triton X-100 and protein A-Sepharose CL 4B were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. ALLN was used at a concentration of 100 μm, OA was used at a concentration of 0.4 mm, Triton X-100 was used at 0.5%, and protein A-Sepharose CL 4B was used at 0.2%. Synthetic lactacystin and rabbit anti-human apoB polyclonal antibody were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem International. Lactacystin was used at a concentration of 10 μm. Sheep anti-human apoB polyclonal antibody was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Transfectam was purchased from Promega; LipofectAMINE was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. MTP inhibitor CP-10447 was provided by Pfizer Inc. (27Haghpassand M. Wilder D. Moberly J.B. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1468-1480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). l-[4,5-3H]leucine was purchased from Amersham with a specific activity of 147 Ci/mmol and used at a concentration of 150 μCi/ml. HepG2 cells and CHO cells obtained from the American Type Culture Collection were grown as described previously (5Dixon J.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 167-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. The medium was changed every 3 days, and experiments were started after the cells reached 70–90% confluence. During the experiments, cells were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in serum-free minimum Eagle's medium containing 1.5% bovine serum albumin with the indicated additions or treatments. In transfection experiments, HepG2 or CHO cells were treated with Transfectam or LipofectAMINE with or without apoB cDNAs. After 36 h, cells were labeled withl-[4,5-3H]leucine for 2 h in the presence or absence of the indicated additions or treatments. Cell lysates and conditioned medium were analyzed by immunoprecipitation with either rabbit anti-human apoB polyclonal antibodies or sheep anti-human apoB polyclonal antibodies. Both antibodies gave similar immunoprecipitation results. The apoB16 expression plasmid pB515 (15Zhou M. Wu X. Huang L.-S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25220-25224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) was digested with EheI and BsrFI and subsequentlySalI to liberate a 2308-base pairEheI-SalI fragment initiating at nucleotide 211 of the apoB cDNA (residue −5 relative to mature apoB) and terminating within the plasmid polylinker. The gel-purified fragment representing the amino-terminal 16% of apoB was ligated back into pB515 that had been digested with EcoRV (corresponding to nucleotide 1960 or residue 606 of apoB, which is approximately 13% from the amino-terminal) and SalI to produce an in-frame fusion of apoB13 and apoB16. This plasmid, pB13,16, was again digested with EcoRV and SalI and ligated to theEheI-SalI fragment of pB515 to produce the plasmid pB13,13,16, in which apoB13, apoB13, and apoB16 were linked consecutively. A comparison of these apoB constructs with a schematic representation of apoB100 is shown in Fig.1. A 718-base pair fragment of the apoB cDNA corresponding to the first β sheet domain (apoB28–34; nucleotides 4137–4855; residues 1270–1542) was synthesized in a polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotides B28–34-5′ (GAAGATCTTCACTGGAGAGTTCCAAGTCCCTACT) and B28–34-3′ (GAAGATCTTCAGCTCGTAGTTCTCATACTTTAGGGA). This produced a cDNA corresponding to the β sheet domain flanked byBglII sites (underlined sequences). This PCR fragment was digested with BglII and ligated to the linear form of pB13,16 partially digested with BglII. The products of this reaction comprise in-frame insertions of the β sheet domain sequence at each of the three BglII sites within apoB13,16. Insertion of the β sheet domain at the first BglII site corresponding to 9.5% of apoB13,16 was confirmed at the nucleotide level by sequencing. Similarly, insertion of the β sheet domain into the second BglII site corresponding to 22.5% of apoB13,16 was confirmed by sequencing. A comparison of this apoB construct with apoB100 is shown in Fig. 1. ApoB34 and apoB42 are carboxyl-terminal truncations of apoB100 that have β sheet domains. An apoB48 cDNA clone with a heterologous promoter derived from cytomegalovirus was constructed as described previously (28Heinemann T. Metzger S. Fisher E.A. Breslow J.L. Huang L.-S. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 2200-2211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An oligonucleotide (CTAGTCTAGACTAG) containing a translation termination codon and a XbaI site was inserted into the PmlI site (nucleotide 4663) of the apoB48 cDNA clone that terminates translation at amino acid 1483 and therefore expresses ApoB34. ApoB42 was kindly provided by Dr. Zemin Yao of the Ottowa Heart Institute (ON, Canada). Microsomes were prepared according to methods described previously (12Furukawa S. Sakata N. Ginsberg H.N. Dixon J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22630-22638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected cells from two 100-mm dishes were combined and disrupted by 20 passes through a ball-bearing homogenizer. Intact cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 9,000 × g, and the microsomes were isolated after centrifugation for 1 h at 105,000 × g. The microsomes were incubated with or without proteinase K (PK) (50 μg/ml) or Triton X-100 (0.5%) for 30 min on ice. After digestion, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (3 mm) was added, and the samples were incubated for another 5 min on ice. The samples were then recentrifuged, and the microsome pellets were dissolved in lysis buffer and analyzed by immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation of apoB in medium and cell lysates was carried out according to the methods of Wuet al. (29Wu X. Zhou M. Huang L.S. Wetterau J. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10277-10281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, after the samples were incubated on a shaker for 10 h at 4 °C with an excess amount of anti-apoB antiserum, the immune complex was precipitated by an additional 3-h incubation with protein A-Sepharose CL 4B. The samples were analyzed on either 3–15 or 4% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and further analyzed by densitometry using a Molecular Dynamics densitometer. Data were expressed as relative densitometric units. In our initial experiments, we wished to determine whether the translocation of nascent apoB was affected by the presence or absence of β sheet domains. We isolated microsomes and used the sensitivity of nascent apoB to exogenous protease digestion as a measure of translocation (9Davis R.A. Prewett A.B. Chan D.C. Thompson J.J. Borchardt R.A.

Under the conditions of this assay, apoB100 and apoB constructs that are fully protected from exogenously added PK should be those that have been completely translocated, whereas any apoB species that are sensitive to proteolysis should be in a partially translocated, bitopic orientation. Based on our previous studies (12Furukawa S. Sakata N. Ginsberg H.N. Dixon J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22630-22638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and those of others (9Davis R.A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7328-7337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we expected that the majority of nascent apoB100 molecules would be partially translocated and susceptible to PK; endogenous apoB100 could therefore serve as a positive control against which to compare the sensitivity to proteolysis of other transfected apoB species in each experiment. Thirty-six h after HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with apoB cDNAs, cells were labeled for 2 h with [3H]leucine. Microsomes were then isolated and subjected to PK digestion in vitro to provide an estimate of translocation efficiency. After PK digestion, immunoreactive bands of full-length apoB100 and apoB42, two β sheet domain-containing species, were significantly decreased, but there was no detectable change in the immunoreactive band for apoB13,13,16, which contains α globular domains, but no β sheet domains (Fig.2). All of the protein bands disappeared when both Triton X-100, which disrupts microsomes, and PK were in the incubation media, indicating that the resistance of apoB13,13,16 to PK digestion was not due to insufficient PK activity or an inherent resistance to PK. Because apoB13,13,16 is equal in length to apoB42, the difference in sensitivity to PK digestion between apoB13,13,16 and apoB42 could not be due to differences in length between these constructs. Similar experiments were carried out using the chimeric construct apoB13,16,β, into which the amphipathic β sheet domain situated between apoB28 and B34 had been inserted into the first-third of apoB13,16. HepG2 cells were transfected with either apoB13,16 or apoB13,16,β, and 36 h later, they were labeled for 2 h with [3H]leucine. Microsomes were then isolated and subjected to PK digestion in vitro. In contrast to the lack of effect of PK on apoB13,16 (0.94 ± 0.25 relative densitometric units compared with undigested control; n = 4), apoB13,16,β was decreased by 75% (0.25 ± 0.09 relative densitometric units;n = 4) after PK digestion (Fig.3). Again, apoB100 was significantly reduced by PK in all transfected cells, and all bands disappeared when Triton X-100 was present together with PK in the media. Inefficient translocation of β sheet domain-containing constructs was further examined in CHO cells, which lack MTP activity. When CHO cells were co-transfected with apoB13,16 and apoB13,16,β or with apoB13,16 and apoB34, the β sheet domain-containing constructs, apoB13,16,β and apoB34, were reduced by 85% (0.15 ± 0.04 relative densitometric units; n = 3) and 79% (0.21 ± 0.03 relative densitometric units; n = 3), respectively, after the PK digestion of isolated microsomes, whereas apoB13,16 was unaffected (0.92 ± 0.23 relative densitometric units;n = 3) (Fig. 4). The same results were obtained with the apoB13,16,β construct into which the β sheet had been inserted in the second-third of apoB13,16 (data not shown; see “Experimental Procedures”). The results described above indicated that the addition of a β sheet domain to an apoB construct otherwise containing only α globular domains (apoB13,16,β versus apoB13,16) was sufficient to cause translocation to become inefficient. If this is true, then the simple addition of a β sheet domain should convert apoB constructs with only α globular domains to ones that are dependent on the availability of core lipids and are sensitive to proteasomal degradation. To directly assess the involvement of the β sheet domain in determining the responsiveness to lipid availability and sensitivity to proteasomal degradation, HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with apoB cDNAs. Thirty-six h after transfection, the cells were preincubated for 2 h with and without OA (0.4 mm) to stimulate lipid synthesis or with and without ALLN (100 μm) to inhibit proteasomal degradation. The cells were then labeled with [3H]leucine for 2 h. OA significantly increased both the cell and medium levels of full-length apoB100 and apoB42 but not apoB13,13,16 (Fig.5). OA and ALLN both increased the cell levels of full-length apoB100 and apoB13,16,β but had no effect on the cell levels of apoB13,16 (Fig. 6). apoB100 and apoB13,16,β were increased approximately 3× by OA (apoB100, 2.82 ± 0.23 relative densitometric units compared with control; apoB13,16,β, 3.01 ± 0.65 relative densitometric units,n = 4) and 2× by ALLN (apoB100, 2.02 ± 0.40 relative densitometric units; apoB13,16,β, 2.13 ± 0.32 relative densitometric units, n = 4) (Fig. 6).Figure 6ApoB13,16,β was significantly increased by OA or ALLN treatment, but apoB13,16 was not affected. HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with apoB13,16 (left three lanes) or apoB13,16,β (right three lanes) cDNAs as indicated at the bottom of the figure. Thirty-six h after transfection, the cells were preincubated with or without either OA (0.4 mm) or ALLN (100 μm) for 2 h and labeled with [3H]leucine for 2 h in the absence or presence of OA or ALLN. After labeling, cell lysates were analyzed by immunoprecipitation and densitometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further test the sensitivity of β sheet domain-containing species to proteasomal degradation, similar experiments were carried out in CHO cells using another proteasomal inhibitor, lactacystin. Thirty-six h after CHO cells were transiently transfected with apoB cDNAs, the cells were preincubated for 2 h and labeled with [3H]leucine for 2 h in the presence or absence of lactacystin (10 μm) to inhibit proteasomal degradation. Cell levels of apoB42 and apoB13,16,β were increased approximately 2.5× by lactacystin treatment (apoB42, 2.32 ± 0.32 relative densitometric units; apoB13,16,β, 2.53 ± 0.33 relative densitometric units, n = 3), whereas apoB13,16 and apoB13,13,16 levels were unchanged (Fig.7). These data suggest that the amphipathic β sheet domain plays a critical role in the response of apoB to OA and to either ALLN or lactacystin treatment. Furthermore, these results provide compelling evidence to support the hypothesis that β sheet domains determine translocation efficiency, lipid binding, and sensitivity to proteasomal degradation of apoB100. The role of MTP in the translocation of apoB100 and its assembly with lipids has been demonstrated in both hepatic cells and in nonhepatic cells expressing truncated apoB100 fragments (6Wang S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18686-18694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and this interaction requires only the amino-terminal 13% of apoB100 (32Patel S.B. Grundy S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18686-18694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Recent studies by Bakillah et al. (33Bakillah A. Jamil H. Hussain M.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3727-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and Hussain et al. (34Hussain M.M. Bakillah A. Jamil H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13060-13067Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) have identified specific binding sites within the first 16% of apoB100. Despite the fact that the interaction of MTP with apoB100 seems to occur within the α globular region of apoB100, the presence of β sheet domains seems to make MTP essential for secretion. We therefore sought to determine whether the simple addition of a β sheet domain would make apoB constructs dependent on MTP. HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with apoB cDNAs and labeled with [3H]leucine for 2 h in the presence or absence of MTP inhibitor. When HepG2 cells were incubated with 100 μm of the MTP inhibitor CP-10447, the cell levels of apoB42, apoB13,16,β, and full-length apoB100 decreased more than 80% (apoB100, 0.19 ± 0.07 relative densitometric units compared with control; apoB42, 0.18 ± 0.08 relative densitometric units,n = 4; apoB13,16,β, 0.17 ± 0.07 relative densitometric units, n = 5). Increased apoB degradation associated with MTP inhibition was significantly blocked by the co-incubation of cells with lactacystin (Fig.8). By contrast, the levels of apoB13,16 and apoB13,13,16 were unaffected by the inhibition of MTP. Secretion of apoB species containing β sheet domains (i.e. full-length apoB100, apoB42, and apoB13,16,β) was also significantly decreased by the inhibition of MTP (data not shown). These results indicate that the presence of β sheet domains makes MTP activity essential for the efficient translocation of apoB across the ER membrane, and that the increased degradation of β sheet domain-containing apoB species that occurs when MTP is inhibited is mediated by the proteasomal degradation pathway. Efficient co-translational insertion into the translocon and translocation across the ER membrane have been a well-accepted model for the initial processing of secretory proteins (35Simon S.M. Blobel G. Cell. 1991; 65: 371-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 36Corsi A.K. Schekman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30299-30302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Evidence accumulated during the past 10 years, however, has indicated that the initial intracellular transport of apoB100 does not fit this paradigm (5Dixon J.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 167-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Yao Z. Tran K. McLeod R.S. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1937-1953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, it appears that after normal insertion of the amino-terminal of nascent apoB into the translocon, further translocation is either relatively slow or actually stops, resulting in a breakdown of the typical segregation of secretory proteins from the cytosol. In the present studies, we have attempted to gain insight into the molecular basis for the inefficient translocation across the ER membrane of the secretory protein apoB100. The importance of this “aberrant” processing of apoB100 is that inefficient translocation is likely to be a major regulatory step that determines how many apoB100-containing lipoproteins are assembled and secreted by the liver (5Dixon J.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 167-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Yao Z. Tran K. McLeod R.S. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1937-1953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our present results strongly indicate that hydrophobic β sheet domains present in apoB100 play a crucial role in determining the translocation efficiency of this important lipid carrier molecule. The results from PK digestion experiments in isolated microsomes indicated that the difference in sensitivity to PK-induced degradation between apoB42, apoB34, and apoB13,16,β, which contain β sheet domains, and apoB13,16 or apoB13,13,16, which have no β sheet domains, derives directly from the effects of the β sheet on translocation efficiency (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). Thus, apoB13,16 and apoB13,13,16 were intralumenal and were not accessible to PK, whereas apoB34, apoB42, apoB13,16,β, and full-length apoB100 were incompletely translocated and were accessible to exogenously added protease in isolated microsome preparations. Our demonstration that the simple addition of a β sheet domain to apoB13,16 significantly reduced translocation efficiency clearly indicates that the β sheet domain between 28 and 34% of full-length apoB is directly involved in the translocation process. Incomplete translocation of apoB100 across the ER membrane results in a bitopic orientation of apoB100 in which some domains are exposed to the cytosol, and some are exposed to the ER lumen (9Davis R.A.

Using the human apoB chimeric constructs (apoB13,16, apoB13,13,16, and apoB13,16,β) and the carboxyl-terminal truncations (apoB34 and apoB42), we have demonstrated that the amphipathic β sheet domain plays a critical role in the response of apoB to OA and either ALLN or lactacystin treatment (Figs.

We previously showed that both posttranslational and co-translational ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of apoB100 are significantly increased when apoB translocation is arrested by an inhibition of MTP (7Fisher E.A.

Our present studies addressed the question of whether MTP inhibition affects apoB β sheet domain-containing constructs and apoB constructs lacking β-sheet domains differently. Treatment of HepG2 cells with a MTP inhibitor significantly decreased the intracellular levels of newly synthesized apoB42, apoB34, and apoB13,16,β, whereas levels of apoB13,16 and apoB13,13,16 were unaffected (Fig. 8), indicating that the presence of β sheet domains makes MTP activity essential for the efficient translocation of apoB100 across the ER membrane. Our demonstration that lactacystin prevents the degradation of β sheet domain-containing constructs during MTP inhibition is consistent with prior data indicating that the degradation of inefficiently translocated apoB100 is mediated by the proteasomal degradation pathway. Although MTP is required for the translocation of β sheet domain-containing apoB species, recent unpublished data from our laboratory suggest that the binding of MTP to apoB100 is not dependent on the presence of β sheet domains, and that β sheet domains do not bind to MTP in the absence of the amino terminus of apoB. 2J. Liang, H. Jiang, L.-S. Huang, S. L. Sturley, and H. Ginsberg, unpublished data. Our unpublished work is consistent with recent studies by Bakillah et al. (33Bakillah A. Jamil H. Hussain M.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3727-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and Hussain et al. (34Hussain M.M. Bakillah A. Jamil H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13060-13067Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) demonstrating binding sites for MTP in the first 16% of apoB100. Although the possibility that the putative topogenic “pause transfer sequences” (18Chuck S.L. Yao Z. Blachhart B.D. McCarthy B.J. Lingappa V.R. Nature. 1990; 346: 382-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 19Chuck S.L. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 9-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) may lead to a transmembrane topology is not excluded by these studies, our results have demonstrated clearly that the translocation efficiency of apoB100 can be determined by the presence of hydrophobic β sheet domains. Indeed, because apoB13,16 and apoB13,13,16 contain numerous pause transfer sequences (40Rusinol A.E. Hegde R.S. Chuck S.L. Lingappa V.R. Vance J.E. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1287-1294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Kivlen M.H. Dorsey C.A. Lingappa V.R. Hegde R.S. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1149-1162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it seems unlikely that those sequences play independent roles in the translocation of apoB100 in cultured cells. Our direct comparison of apoB13,16 and apoB13,16,β, which contain similar numbers of disulfide bonds and glycosylation sites, also indicates that the inefficient translocation of apoB100 is not linked exclusively to either amino-terminal disfulfide bond formation or glycosylation. Support for the importance of β sheet domains for the assembly of triglyceride-enriched lipoproteins comes from the recent studies by Mcleod et al. (26Mcleod R.S. Wang Y. Wang S. Rusinol A. Links P. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18445-18455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), who found that the addition of the a β sheet domain to apoA-I was associated with the secretion of the chimeric protein on a triglyceride-enriched lipoprotein. Of note, those authors found that the addition of the same β sheet domain that we used to the carboxyl-terminal of apoA-I did not cause significant sensitivity of the chimeric protein to exogenous protease digestion of isolated microsomes. They concluded, therefore, that the initial translocation of apoB100 was not determined by β sheet domains. It is likely that because they placed the β sheet domain at the very carboxyl-terminal end of their chimeric construct, the translocation of their apoA-I/apoB chimera was nearly complete before the β sheet domain could interact with the translocation channel. In our constructs, the β sheet domain was positioned either in the first or second third of the chimeric protein; therefore, translocation arrest would have resulted in the exposure of a significant portion of apoB to the cytosol. In conclusion, our results from experiments with both carboxyl-terminal truncations of full-length apoB100 and chimeric apoB constructs with or without a β sheet domain demonstrate clearly that the translocation efficiency, susceptibility to proteasomal degradation, responsiveness to OA treatment, and sensitivity to MTP inhibition of apoB are mediated by the presence of hydrophobic, lipid binding β sheet domains. We and others have recently demonstrated that apoB100 is associated with the translocon proteins, Sec 61α (39Chen Y. Le Caherec F. Chuck S.L. J. Biol.

Rappoport T.A. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1998; 92: 621-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We speculate that such an interaction could result in the significant slowing or cessation of translocation and the exposure of more carboxyl-terminal regions of apoB100 to the cytosol. Studies to test this hypothesis are the focus of our current experiments."

However, using microscopic methods with higher resolution, in numerous reports, it is now well accepted that most AM dyes will accumulate to a variable extent in intracellular organelles such as endoplasmic reticulum (2Hofer A.M.

Similarly, the low luminescence signals of aequorin did not allow for resolving signals from single mitochondria. We have recently established confocal fura-2 ratio imaging (20Nitschke R. Wilhelm S. Borlinghaus R. Bindels R.J.M. Leipziger J. Greger R. Pflügers Arch. 1997; 433: 653-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and further improved FDIM by using a high sensitivity, high resolution, intensified CCD camera, which allows simultaneous measurement of cytosolic, nuclear, and mitochondrial Ca2+ signals in response to agonist stimulation in the epithelial cell line HT29. Furthermore, we present data showing high resolution two-photon fura-2 imaging using a prototype microscope with a new turn-key pulsed IR laser source.DISCUSSIONThe present experiments were performed to evaluate the role of mitochondrial Ca2+ in response to agonist stimulation. By using confocal fura-2 imaging, two-photon microscopy, and high resolution FDIM, simultaneous measurement of the Ca2+signals in at least three cellular compartments (cytosol, nucleus, and mitochondria) was possible.Mitochondrial Localization of Fura-2Mitochondrial localization of a substantial amount of fura-2 after AM loading was evaluated by correlating the fura-2 distribution with the UV autofluorescence and the pattern of mitochondrial markers. Our results are comparable with reports on the fura-2 or fluo-3 distribution in myocytes (12Chacon E. Ulrich R. Acosta D. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 14Chacon E. Ohata H. Harper I.S. Trollinger D.R. Herman B. Lemasters J.J.

Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). In addition, the bleaching experiments using confocal microscopy indicate that fura-2 enters the mitochondria in the AM form, where it is trapped or bound after cleavage. In addition, the bleaching of single mitochondrial structures reveals that in HT29 cells mitochondria do not form a continuous network throughout the cytosol. This is in contrast to recent findings in HeLa cells, where recombinant green fluorescent protein was used to label mitochondria (32Rizzuto R. Pinton P. Carrington W. Fay F.S. Fogarty K.E. Lifshitz L.M. Tuft R.A. Pozzan T. Science. 1998; 280: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar). However, measurements made in our laboratory on primary cultures of hepatocytes also support the idea that mitochondria in these cells indeed can form a network extending over 10–20 μm. 2S. Ricken, R. Greger, and R. Nitschke, unpublished data. Are the Properties of Intramitochondrial Fura-2 Comparable to Those of Cytosolic Fura-2?The spectroscopic measurements, the experiments with FCCP, and the bleaching experiments presented in this paper strongly indicate that fura-2 inside the mitochondria is in a Ca2+-sensing form. This has already been shown for fura-2 and indo-1 in isolated mitochondria (6Gunter T.E. Restrepo D. Gunter K.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: 304-310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Reers M. Kelly R.A. Smith T.W. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 33Lukacs G.L. Kapus A. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, in these publications, no consensus was reached about how much fura-2 properties are changed within the mitochondrial environment. We tried to calibrate the fura-2 Ca2+ signal in vivo inside the mitochondrion using the usual calibration procedure of the fura-2 signal with ionomycin, as has been used for HT29 cells from our laboratory extensively over the last years (22Nitschke R. Leipziger J. Greger R. Pflügers Arch. 1993; 423: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 30Leipziger J. Nitschke R. Greger R. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 1991; 1: 273-285Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 34Nitschke R. Benning N. Ricken S. Leipziger J. Fischer K.-G. Greger R. Pflügers Arch. 1997; 434: 466-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Ionomycin treatment gave almost equal fura-2 ratio values in the cytosol and the nucleus, but the R max value in the mitochondria was always slightly lower. In many cells, ionomycin is known to increase [Ca2+]i, not directly by acting as a Ca2+ ionophore in the outer cell membrane, but by first emptying inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive intracellular stores via an unknown mechanism and by the subsequent maximal opening of the Ca2+ influx pathways usually named capacitative Ca2+ entry (35Purkiss J.R. Willars G.B. Cell Calcium. 1996; 20: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 36Putney J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). This action of ionomycin can be unmasked in HT29 cells by lowering the extracellular Ca2+ to 10−5 mol/liter after ionomycin application, which results in a drop of [Ca2+]ito or below the resting level of the cell (data not shown). From thein vitro fura-2 calibration curve, this is unexpected, as the fura-2 signal still should be nearly saturated at 10−5mol/liter Ca2+. However, taking into the account the described Ca2+ sensitivity of the capacitative Ca2+ entry mechanism in HT29 cells (22Nitschke R. Leipziger J. Greger R. Pflügers Arch. 1993; 423: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 37Kerst G. Fischer K.G. Normann C. Kramer A. Leipziger J. Greger R. Pflügers Arch. 1995; 430: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), our data fit very well with the concept of an ionomycin-induced opening of the capacitative Ca2+ entry-influx pathway (35Purkiss J.R. Willars G.B. Cell Calcium. 1996; 20: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Raising the ionomycin concentration to also enhance mitochondrial Ca2+ permeability resulted in a fast loss of the dye from the whole cell, including all cellular compartments. Other permeabilizing nonspecific agents, such as Triton and digitonin, gave similar results (data not shown; n = 5). Therefore, a direct permeabilization of mitochondria for Ca2+ was not possible in intact HT29 cells. Even the calibration of the cytosolic and the nuclear fura-2 signal with ionomycin has to be questioned in future studies, despite the fact that it is a well accepted and frequently employed method. From our spectroscopic measurements and the results of others (6Gunter T.E. Restrepo D. Gunter K.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: 304-310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Reers M. Kelly R.A. Smith T.W. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 33Lukacs G.L. Kapus A. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we propose that the fura-2 properties inside mitochondria are comparable to the cytosolic form. In addition, the results of our measurements could hardly be explained alone on the basis of changed fura-2 properties inside mitochondria. Due to the problems with an adequate calibration of [Ca2+]m, we preferred to use, throughout this report, ratio values for [Ca2+]m, except for some mean values, where we used the ionomycin calibration values from the cytosol despite the observed limitations of the procedure.Mitochondrial Ca2+ Response Is Dependent on Agonist ConcentrationA number of other laboratories have described changes of [Ca2+]m in response to agonist stimulation in living cells using aequorin targeted to mitochondria (17Hajnóczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 18Rutter G.A. Burnett P. Rizzuto R. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Tavaré J.M. Denton R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5489-5494Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), fluo-3 (31Donnadieu E. Bourguignon L.Y.W. Cell Calcium. 1996; 20: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), or dihydro-rhod-2 (17Hajnóczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 18Rutter G.A. Burnett P. Rizzuto R. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Tavaré J.M. Denton R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5489-5494Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). However, none of these studies reported the concentration response curve of [Ca2+]c and [Ca2+]m to agonists measured simultaneously and on the single cell level. This was due to limitations in sensitivity, limited optical resolution, and/or the dyes used.With the higher concentrations of the agonists CCH, neurotensin, and ATP (for ATP no data were shown), the response in [Ca2+]m to [Ca2+]c was biphasic. The initial rapid rise was only slightly slower than the cytosolic response, followed by a slower rise in [Ca2+]m when a threshold in [Ca2+]c was exceeded. Surprisingly, the response of [Ca2+]m to thapsigargin showed a similar [Ca2+]c dependence. The [Ca2+]c, corresponding to the threshold value for agonists and thapsigargin, was estimated from the experiments shown in Fig. 10, A and B. A ratio of around 5 was obtained, corresponding to around 1200 nmol/liter. Around this cytosolic Ca2+ activity, a strong increase of [Ca2+]m could be observed. A similar, biphasic [Ca2+]m response has been described recently in endothelial cells after stimulation with bradykinin (31Donnadieu E. Bourguignon L.Y.W. Cell Calcium. 1996; 20: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and in cardiac myocytes after electrical stimulation (5Miyata H. Silverman H.S. Sollott S.J. Lakatta E.G. Stern M.D. Hansford R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: 1123-1134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to the results of these studies, we could also not rule out the possibility that the initial, small and fast Ca2+ rise is the result of a spill-over from the cytosolic signal due to a limited zresolution in conventional confocal microscopy and/or the movement of mitochondria. However, even when we used two-photon excitation of fura-2 (the method currently giving the highest possible zresolution for fast dynamic measurements) the results of the Ca2+ measurements were very similar. Therefore, it seems unlikely that the initial [Ca2+]m response is an artifact, even if FCCP did not influence it. In addition, in some of our experiments (for example, Figs. 9 and 11), we measured a discrepancy in the time course for this early phase of the [Ca2+]c and [Ca2+]mincrease. This would indicate that, indeed, different compartments were contributing to the signal. It should also be pointed out that a biphasic [Ca2+]m rise was described in an isolated mitochondria preparation in response to Ca2+pulses (38Sparagna G.C. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.-S. Gunter T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27510-27515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), which speaks against an optical artifact. The initial, fast Ca2+ increase could be caused by the large Ca2+ gradients postulated to exist at the beginning of a Ca2+ signal at sites of close contact to Ca2+-release stores and mitochondria (39Rizzuto R. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Science. 1993; 262: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). In these so-called microdomains, very high Ca2+ activities of 10−4 mol/liter were postulated.All agonists could induce the biphasic increase of [Ca2+]m. The time course of the [Ca2+]m increase, as well as the observed differences between the cytosolic/nuclear and the mitochondrial concentration response curves (Figs. 3, 6, and 7), can be very well explained by the characteristics of the mitochondrial Ca2+uptake mechanisms. The major uptake mechanism for Ca2+ in mitochondria is the Ca2+ uniporter (40Denton R.M. McCormack J.G. Annu. Rev.

These values fit quite nicely with our results (Fig. 8, A andB) and with described relations of [Ca2+]i and [Ca2+]m in cardiac myocytes after electrical stimulation (5Miyata H. Silverman H.S.

Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). The results of our measurement of autofluorescence (Fig. 10) are in good agreement with the measurements cited above. A number of mitochondria-specific enzymes, such as the three dehydrogenases for pyruvate, 2-oxyglutarate, and NAD+-isocitrate (18Rutter G.A. Burnett P. Rizzuto R. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T.

Biochem. 1995; 149/150: 203-212Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar), are known to be stimulated by an increased [Ca2+]m. These enzymes increase ATP production when cytosolic ATP consumption is increased (40Denton R.M. McCormack J.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 451-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), and this helps the cell to keep pace with the higher energy demand.In conclusion, we have shown, 1) using fura-2AM loading, that fura-2 accumulates in the mitochondria of HT29 cells in a Ca2+-sensitive form; 2) that intramitochondrial fura-2 can be used to estimate the Ca2+ activity of mitochondria; 3) that inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-coupled agonists (CCH, neurotensin, and ATP) induce, in addition to their effect on [Ca2+]c and [Ca2+]n, a dose-dependent increase in the mitochondrial Ca2+ signal (the differentiated mitochondrial Ca2+ response may allow the cells to fine-tune their energetic response to hormone stimulation); and 4) that mitochondria in addition might serve as a sink or a modulator for [Ca2+]c and [Ca2+]n. Initial observations with the AM form of the Ca2+-sensitive dye quin-2 indicated that the free acid form of the dye does not accumulate within intracellular compartments (1Rink T.J. Pozzan T. Cell Calcium. 1985; 6: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, using microscopic methods with higher resolution, in numerous reports, it is now well accepted that most AM dyes will accumulate to a variable extent in intracellular organelles such as endoplasmic reticulum (2Hofer A.M. Machen T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2598-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), endocytotic vesicles (3Malgaroli A. Milani D. Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. J.

For isolated mitochondria, it has been shown that they can convert the AM form of fura-2 or indo-1 to the Ca2+-sensitive forms (6Gunter T.E. Restrepo D. Gunter K.K. Am. J.

Due to limited optical resolution in the x–y direction and to an even greater extent in the z direction, further attempts were made using confocal microscopy (13Nathanson M.H. Burgstahler A.D.

Similarly, the low luminescence signals of aequorin did not allow for resolving signals from single mitochondria. We have recently established confocal fura-2 ratio imaging (20Nitschke R. Wilhelm S. Borlinghaus R. Bindels R.J.M. Leipziger J. Greger R. Pflügers Arch. 1997; 433: 653-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and further improved FDIM by using a high sensitivity, high resolution, intensified CCD camera, which allows simultaneous measurement of cytosolic, nuclear, and mitochondrial Ca2+ signals in response to agonist stimulation in the epithelial cell line HT29. Furthermore, we present data showing high resolution two-photon fura-2 imaging using a prototype microscope with a new turn-key pulsed IR laser source. DISCUSSIONThe present experiments were performed to evaluate the role of mitochondrial Ca2+ in response to agonist stimulation. By using confocal fura-2 imaging, two-photon microscopy, and high resolution FDIM, simultaneous measurement of the Ca2+signals in at least three cellular compartments (cytosol, nucleus, and mitochondria) was possible.Mitochondrial Localization of Fura-2Mitochondrial localization of a substantial amount of fura-2 after AM loading was evaluated by correlating the fura-2 distribution with the UV autofluorescence and the pattern of mitochondrial markers. Our results are comparable with reports on the fura-2 or fluo-3 distribution in myocytes (12Chacon E. Ulrich R. Acosta D. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 14Chacon E. Ohata H. Harper I.S. Trollinger D.R. Herman B. Lemasters J.J.

Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). In addition, the bleaching experiments using confocal microscopy indicate that fura-2 enters the mitochondria in the AM form, where it is trapped or bound after cleavage. In addition, the bleaching of single mitochondrial structures reveals that in HT29 cells mitochondria do not form a continuous network throughout the cytosol. This is in contrast to recent findings in HeLa cells, where recombinant green fluorescent protein was used to label mitochondria (32Rizzuto R. Pinton P. Carrington W. Fay F.S. Fogarty K.E. Lifshitz L.M. Tuft R.A. Pozzan T. Science. 1998; 280: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar). However, measurements made in our laboratory on primary cultures of hepatocytes also support the idea that mitochondria in these cells indeed can form a network extending over 10–20 μm. 2S."

In human skin, keratinocytes of the basal layer of epidermis and the outer root sheath of hair follicles express K5 and K14 as their main keratins. A small subpopulation of basal cells exhibiting stem-cell like characteristics express, in addition, K19. At 40 kDa, this keratin is the smallest IF protein due to an exceptionally short carboxyl-terminal domain. We examined the assembly properties of K19 and contrasted them to K14 in vitro and in vivo. Relative to K5–K14, we find that K5–K19 form less stable tetramers that polymerize into shorter and narrower IFs in vitro. When transiently co-expressed in cultured baby hamster kidney cells, the K5 and K19 combination fails to form a filamentous array, whereas the K5–K14 and K8–K19 ones readily do so. Transient expression of K19 in the epithelial cell lines T51B-Ni and A431 results in its integration into the endogenous keratin network with minimal if any perturbation. Collectively, these results indicate that K19 possesses assembly properties that are distinct from those of K14 and suggest that it may impart unique properties to the basal cells expressing it in skin epithelia.

The >30 known keratins (40–70 kDa) expressed in soft epithelia have been subdivided into type I (acidic, K9–K20) and type II (basic, K1–K8) based on DNA sequence homology and gene structure (1Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). Keratin filament assembly is a multistep process that begins with the formation of a type I–type II heterodimer (2Coulombe P.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), distinguishing them from most other IF proteins, which form homodimers. As a result, an epithelial cell must coordinately express at least one type I and type II keratin genes in order to assemble an IF network in its cytoplasm. Many keratin genes are in fact regulated in a pairwise, differentiation-specific manner, creating patterns that have been well conserved among mammalian species (1Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar, 3O'Guin W.M. Schermer A. Lynch M. Sun T.T. Goldman R.D. Steinert P.M. Cellular and Molecular Biology of Intermediate Filaments. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1990: 301-334Crossref Google Scholar). In stratified epithelia, for instance, the type II gene K5 and the type I genes K14 and K15 are expressed in the basal layer, whereas distinct combinations of type I and type II keratin genes are expressed in the differentiating suprabasal layers. A major function of keratin IFs in stratified epithelia is to contribute to the physical strength that is necessary to maintain their integrity in response to normal load of mechanical stress. This is particularly obvious in the epidermis and oral mucosa, as mutations affecting specific keratin proteins underlie several inherited blistering disorders such as epidermolysis bullosa simplex, epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, oral white sponge nevus, and others (2Coulombe P.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 4McLean W.H.I. Lane E.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 5Fuchs E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 189-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). One of the most intriguing keratin is K19. At 40 kDa, this type I keratin is the smallest known IF protein (6Wu Y.-J. Rheinwald J.G. Cell. 1981; 25: 627-635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 7Moll R. von Bassewitz D.B. Schultz U. Franke W.W. Differentiation. 1982; 22: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The primary structure of human, bovine, and mouse K19 is highly conserved and made unique by virtue of an exceptionally short (13-residue long) tail domain at the carboxyl terminus (8Bader B.L. Magin T.M. Matzfeld M. Franke W.W. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1865-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 9Eckert R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gene (Amst.). 1989; 85: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Otherwise, the length of the central rod domain (312 residues), a major determinant of IF polymerization (1Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar, 2Coulombe P.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), is highly conserved, whereas the size of the non-helical, amino-terminal head domain (72 residues) is within the range observed for type I keratins (8Bader B.L. Magin T.M. Matzfeld M. Franke W.W. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1865-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 9Eckert R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The primary structure of K19 is better related to the type I epidermal keratins than to K18, which predominates in simple epithelia (10Stasiak P.C. Purkis P.E. Leigh I.M. Lane B. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1989; 92: 707-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Still, the K19 gene is expressed in a variety of unrelated cell types in both simple and complex epithelia, such that there is no obvious relationship between the presence of K19 protein and the structure or function of an epithelial cell (10Stasiak P.C. Purkis P.E. Leigh I.M. Lane B. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1989; 92: 707-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Moll R. Franke W.W. Schiller D.L. Geiger B. Krepler R.

Although this combination of an unusual primary structure and heterogeneous distribution renders K19 particularly interesting, the function that it may perform remains unclear. In adult human skin epithelia, K19 is found in a relatively small subset of keratinocytes in the basal layer and in Merkel cells, a minor population (<1%) of mechanosensory cells (Refs. 16Moll I. Cell Tissue Res. 1994; 277: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar and 17Lacour J.P. Dubois D. Pisani A. Ortonne J.P. Br. J. Dermatol. 1991; 125: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar and references therein). These two cell types are functionally distinct and can be discriminated based on the specific reactivity of Merkel cells with antibodies directed against K18 and K20 (16Moll I. Cell Tissue Res. 1994; 277: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 18Moll R. Moll I. Franke W.W.

Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 635-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In human trunk skin, the K19-containing keratinocytes were found to localize to a distinct region of hair follicles known as the bulge, where they are confined to the basal layer of the outer root sheath. In the thicker glabrous epidermis of palms and soles, K19-containing keratinocytes are restricted to the deep portion of the rete ridges and are again confined to the basal layer (20Michel M. Török N. Godbout M.-J. Lussier M. Gaudreau P. Royal A. Germain L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1017-1028PubMed Google Scholar). Such a distribution is intriguing, as both the bulge area of hair follicles and the deep portion of the epidermis in glabrous skin were shown to contain the reservoir of stem cells in adult skin (21Lavker R.M. Sun T.-T. Science. 1982; 215: 1239-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 22Cotsarelis G. Sun T.T. Lavker R.M. Cell. 1990; 61: 1329-1337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar). Michel et al. (20Michel M. Török N. Godbout M.-J. Lussier M. Gaudreau P. Royal A. Germain L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1017-1028PubMed Google Scholar) reported that many of the [3H]thymidine label-retaining cells in these areas of mouse skin actually express K19, raising the possibility that a sizable fraction of the K19-expressing skin keratinocytes may be stem cells. Here we examine the assembly properties of K19 at the subunit, 10-nm filament, and cytoplasmic organization levels. The results of our studies suggest that K19 possesses distinct assembly properties that are likely to impact on the organization of keratin filaments in the progenitor cells of the skin. Frozen sections of human skin samples, cultured newborn foreskin keratinocytes (23Germain L. Rouabhia M. Guignard R. Carrier L. Bouvard V. Auger F.A.

Western blots were revealed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma).

Purified recombinant type I and type II keratins were mixed in a ∼45:55 molar ratio at ≈250 μg·ml−1, incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and fractionated by anion-exchange chromatography on a Pharmacia Mono Q column (31Paladini R.D.

Fractions containing type I-type II heterotypic complexes were pooled, dialyzed, and subjected to chemical cross-linking using BS3 (bis-(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate; Pierce) as described (31Paladini R.D.

Cross-linked products were resolved on a 4–16% gradient SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. Densitometry was performed using the public domain NIH Image 1.59 software 2Available on-line at the following address:http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ nih-image. to estimate the relative yield of each major product of the reaction. For the competition assays, ≈300–435 μg of K14, K19, and K5 were mixed in a molar ratio of ≈1:1:1 to generate a final mixture having a 280 μg·ml−1 protein concentration. The mixture was analyzed by chromatography and SDS-PAGE as described above. Calculations and densitometric analyses were performed using NIH Image. Mono Q fractions containing heterotypic keratin complexes were used for in vitro polymerization assays (32Coulombe P. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 153-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Polymerization was achieved by dialysis of samples at 300 μg·ml−1 against 9 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm β-ME, pH 7.6, at room temperature and then against 3 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm β-ME, pH 7.2, at 4 °C, for 16–24 h. In some experiments, the ionic strength of the final buffer was 50 mm Tris-HCl. Polymerized keratins were visualized by negative staining (1% uranyl acetate) on a Zeiss EM10A electron microscope (31Paladini R.D. Takahashi K. Bravo N.S. Coulombe P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 381-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). For filament length determination, negatives (magnification, × 20,000) were scanned and analyzed using the NIH image software. Measurements were made on a random sample of 74–117 filaments from two independent experiments. For filament width determination, 50 filaments were randomly selected from photographic prints (magnification, × 61,250) collated from three independent experiments. Statistical analyses were done using Student'st test. Polymerization efficiency was determined via a pelleting assay on the final assemblies as described (31Paladini R.D. Takahashi K. Bravo N.S.

Bravo N.S. Coulombe P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 381-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). pMK8 and pMK18 (kindly provided by B. Omary) are derivatives of the CMV promoter-based pMRB101 expression plasmid (34Ku N.O. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For transient transfection assays, all cell lines were cultivated in media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics unless otherwise indicated. BHK-21 cells and NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, PtK2 (35Franke W.W. Schmid E. Osborn M. Weber K. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 17: 392-411Google Scholar), and A431 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:Ham's F12 (3:1) medium and T51B cells, an established cell line derived from adult rat liver as well as T51B-Ni, a subclone selected by prolonged exposure of the parental cell line to nickel subsulfide (Ref. 36Blouin R. Swierenga S.H.H. Marceau N. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1992; 70: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar; a gift from N. Marceau, Quebec, Canada) were cultivated in α- minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Immunocorp.). Transfections were done on subconfluent cells grown on 22-mm2 glass coverslips using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (31Paladini R.D. Takahashi K. Bravo N.S. Coulombe P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 381-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) or a polycation-mediated gene transfer using polyethylenenimine (Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI) (37Boussif O. Lezoualc'h F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (5675) Google Scholar). At 24–72 h post-transfection, cells were fixed with absolute methanol for 20 min at −20 °C and processed for indirect double immunofluorescence as described above. As routine controls, CMV-GW1 or mock-transfected cells were processed in parallel with the relevant antibodies. For the epithelial cell lines that already express endogenous keratins, we cotransfected vectors containing keratins cDNAs with limiting amount (1:9 ratio GFP:total DNA) of pEGFP-N1 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and relied on the intrinsic fluorescence of the green fluorescence protein to identify transfected cells after fixation with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min and cold methanol for 20 min. For quantitation of transfected keratins, BHK, PtK2, and A431 cells were seeded on 100-mm plates that contained one 22-mm2 glass coverslip. BHK cells were cotransfected with the following CMV plasmid combinations: K5 and K14, K5 and K19, K14 and K19, or CMV vector alone. PtK2 and A431 cells were transfected with each of control CMV, CMV-K14 cDNA, and CMV-K19 cDNA plasmids. The amounts of DNA and the volume of precipitates were scaled up on a per surface area basis to maintain conditions similar to those prevailing in 35-mm culture dishes. At 26–30 h post-transfection, the glass coverslips were processed for staining to determine transfection efficiency. The remaining cells were recovered by scraping directly in gel loading buffer (total protein extracts). For SDS-PAGE/immunoblot analyses, known amounts of purified recombinant K14 or K19 (10, 20, 40, and 60 ng) were co-electrophoresed along with extracts prepared from transfected cells and blotted onto nitrocellulose. Blots were double-stained for the endogenous K8–18 (PtK2 cells) or vimentin (BHK cells) to ensure that equal amount of proteins were loaded in each lane. At each step, blots were scanned and densitometric analyses done using NIH image. Double immunofluorescence microscopy was performed to identify the type II keratins that occur in the subset of K19-positive basal keratinocytes. Our studies focused on the type II keratins K5, K6, K7 and K8, as these are known to occur in glabrous and hairy skin (3O'Guin W.M. Schermer A. Lynch M. Sun T.T. Goldman R.D. Steinert P.M.

We did not attempt to localize either K1 and K2e, as these are restricted to the suprabasal differentiating layers in epidermis and in the uppermost segment of the hair follicle outer root sheath (see Refs. 40Rothnagel J.A. Dominey A.M. Dempsety L.D. Longley M.A. Greenhalgh D.A. Gagne T.A. Huber M. Frenk E. Hohl D. Roop D.R. Science. 1992; 257: 1128-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar and 41Collin C. Moll R. Kubicka S. Ouhayoun J.P. Franke W.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 202: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar and references therein). As expected (data not shown), we found that K19 co-localizes with K5 and K14 in the outermost (basal) cells of the bulge region of hair follicles (10Stasiak P.C. Purkis P.E. Leigh I.M. Lane B. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1989; 92: 707-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Lane E.B. Wilson C.A. Hughes B.R. M. L.I. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 642: 197-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and in the basal layer of newborn foreskin epidermis. We did not find evidence of co-expression of K19 with either K6 or K7 (data not shown), whereas a very scarce signal for K8 was detected in the hair bulge area, consistent with the relative paucity of Merkel cells in this region (16Moll I. Cell Tissue Res. 1994; 277: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In primary cultures of human foreskin keratinocytes, we find that K19 is expressed in a subset of cells (20Michel M. Török N. Godbout M.-J. Lussier M. Gaudreau P. Royal A. Germain L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1017-1028PubMed Google Scholar) and co-localizes with K5, K6, and K14 (not shown). Under our culture conditions, only a proportion of K19-containing cells also express K8, and we do not detect immunoreactivity for K7 (data not shown). From these studies, we conclude that K5 is likely to be the major type II keratin partner for pairing and co-assembly with K19 in the relevant subset of human skin keratinocytes and that the type I K14 is also present in this cell population. We applied reverse transcriptase-PCR on total RNA from human MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cells to clone the coding sequence of K19. We identified a subclone whose nucleotide sequence is in complete agreement with that previously published by Eckert (9Eckert R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1114-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) with one exception. The PCR-mediated creation of a NcoI restriction site (CCATGG) at the start codon resulted in a Thr (ACT) → Ala (GCC) substitution at the first amino acid. When induced, BL21 (DE3) E. coli transformed with plasmid pET-K19 (see “Materials and Methods”) express a ≈40-kDa protein that is retrieved in the inclusion body fraction and which co-purifies with acidic keratins on a Mono Q anion exchange column (31Paladini R.D.

Chem. 1997; 272: 32557-32565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Purified K19 reacts with a monoclonal antibody to K19 by Western blotting, and the positive recombinant antigen co-migrates with native K19 extracted from cultured human MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1). These data establish the validity of our cDNA clone as well as of the recombinant protein derived from it. To compare the formation of heterotypic complexes involving K5–K19 and K5–K14, these purified keratins were mixed in a predetermined ratio and subjected to established chromatography and chemical cross-linking assays (32Coulombe P. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 153-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 33Wawersik M. Paladini R.D. Noensie E. Coulombe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32557-32565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). When subjected to Mono Q chromatography at pH 8.1 in the presence of 6.5 m urea, purified type II epidermal keratins exist as monomers and elute at ∼70–80 mm Gdn-HCl, designated as “peak 1,” whereas purified type I epidermal keratins (also monomeric) elute at a higher salt concentration (∼100–130 mm Gdn-HCl), designated as “peak 2.” The sequential elution of type II and type I keratins under basic buffer conditions is consistent with their known surface charge (12Moll R. Franke W.W. Schiller D.L. Geiger B. Krepler R. Cell. 1982; 31: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4544) Google Scholar). Mixtures of type I and type II keratins show a different elution profile as follows: heterotetramers elute at a yet higher salt concentration (∼150–175 mm Gdn-HCl),designated as “peak 3”, whereas heterodimers co-elute with type I monomers in peak 2 fractions (Ref. 33Wawersik M. Paladini R.D. Noensie E. Coulombe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32557-32565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar and references therein). When tested individually in the Mono Q chromatography assay, K19 elutes at the position characteristic for monomeric type I keratins (peak 2; data not shown). As expected, no dimer or tetramer is seen when purified K19 is subjected to cross-linking (data not shown). When mixed with K5 prior to chromatography, on the other hand, K19 shows an elution profile consistent with its recruitment in heterotypic complexes. Indeed, the majority of the K5 and K19 proteins elute as a 1:1 complex at a higher Gdn-HCl than either keratin alone, indicating efficient heterotypic complex formation (Fig.2 A). Consistent with the slightly less acidic character of K19 monomer compared with K14 (data not shown), the bulk of K5–K19 heterotypic complexes elute at ≈145–150 mm Gdn-HCl, whereas the peak of K5–K14 complex occurs at ≈155–160 mm Gdn-HCl (Fig. 2 A). In addition, we find that relative to K5–K14, a small fraction of the K5 and K19 proteins co-elute significantly earlier in the Gdn-HCl gradient, in the so-called peak 2 fractions (Fig. 2 A). This suggests that K5–K19 may not form heterotetramers with the same efficiency as K5–K14. Chemical cross-linking using BS3 establishes that the major K5–K19 species formed under 6 m urea buffer conditions is a ≈240-kDa product, with a lesser amount of a ≈130-kDa product (Fig.2 B)."

Inhibition of the GM3-induced CD4 down-modulation was observed in the presence of specific protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors. Scanning confocal microscopy revealed the translocation and clustering on the cell surface of PKC isozymes δ and θ (more evidently than α and β) after GM3 treatment, suggesting the involvement of these isozymes in the ganglioside-induced CD4 down-modulation. Exogenous GM3 induced phosphorylation of CD4 molecule, which then dissociated from p56lck, as early as after 5 min. Moreover, addition of GM3 resulted in a rapid (1 min) cytosolic phospholipase A2 activation with consequent arachidonic acid release, whereas no phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C activity was observed. Both PKC translocation and CD4 down-modulation were blocked by the trifluoromethylketone analog of arachidonic acid, a selective inhibitor of cytosolic phospholipase A2 and by mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor PD98059. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that GM3 may trigger a novel mechanism of modulation of the CD4 surface expression through the activation of enzyme(s) involved in the regulation of cellular functions.

Gangliosides, sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids, are ubiquitous constituents of cell membranes and have been implicated in a variety of biological events occurring at the cell surface (1Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. Science. 1989; 243: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). Cellular gangliosides have been shown to function as receptors for several different molecules and for bacterial toxins (2Fishman P.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1982; 69: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) and are involved in the binding or release of transmitters (3Cumar F.A. Maggio B. Caputto R. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Gangliosides show cell type- and cell differentiation-specific expression patterns. In T lymphocytes, monosialoganglioside GM3 1The abbreviated designations of glycolipids are according to Svennerholm's nomenclature for ganglio series glycopeptides (33Svennerholm L. Biochim.

Henning-Chubb B.C. Huberman E. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 107: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In a previous investigation, we identified GM3-enriched domains on lymphocyte plasma membrane associated with the integral membrane glycoprotein CD4 and its noncovalently linked Src family tyrosine kinase p56lck, suggesting a functional role for GM3-enriched domains in cell-cell interactions, antigen recognition, cell activation and signal transduction (8Sorice M. Parolini I. Sansolini T. Garofalo T. Dolo V. Sargiacomo M. Tai T. Peschle C. Torrisi M.R. Pavan A. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 98-109Google Scholar).Exogenous gangliosides rapidly and significantly bind to biological membranes, modulating the expression and/or the activity of specific surface receptors. Indeed, GM3 is able to down-regulate fibroblast growth factor and epidermal growth factor receptor activities, through the inhibition of tyrosine-kinase activity (9Bremer E.G. Hakomori S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 106: 711-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 10Bremer E.G. Schlessinger J. Hakomori S. J. Biol.

Hakomori S. Bowen-Pope D.F. Raines E. Ross R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6818-6825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and enhances the action of nerve growth factor by binding to Trk, the tyrosine kinase-type receptor for nerve growth factor (12Mutoh T.

Furthermore, exogenous GM1 or binding and cross-linking of endogenous GM1 with B subunit of cholera toxin induces early tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ-1 (13Gouy H. Deterre P. Debré P.

Rampersaud A.A. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 116-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).In human T lymphocytes, exogenous GM1 induced a selective dose-dependent down-modulation of CD4 molecules on the plasma membrane (17Offner H. Thieme T. Vanderbark A.A. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 3295-3305PubMed Google Scholar), reducing in vitro HIV-1 infectivity (18Chieco-Bianchi L. Calabrò M.L. Panozzo M. AIDS. 1989; 3: 501-507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CD4 down-regulation on T cell plasma membrane is a well known molecular event triggered by different stimuli, which, through activation of PKC, induce the phosphorylation of serine residues in the cytoplasmic tail of CD4 molecule and, consequently, the dissociation of the CD4·p56lck complex (19Marsh M. Pelchen-Matthews A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 205: 107-135PubMed Google Scholar). The most effective triggers for CD4 down-regulation are PKC-activating phorbol esters (20Hurley T.R. Luo K. Sefton B.M. Science. 1989; 245: 407-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The GM1-induced CD4 down-modulation, although involving dissociation of CD4·p56lck complex, has been reported to be independent of both CD4 serine phosphorylation and PKC activation (21Repke H. Barber E. Ulbricht S. Buchner K. Hucho F. Kopp R. Scholz H. Rudd C.E. Haseltine W.A. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2585-2591PubMed Google Scholar). We previously reported that also addition of exogenous GM3 induces down-modulation of CD4 molecules in human T lymphocytes, with a CD4 redistribution on the cell surface, and clustering and internalization via endocytic pits and vesicles, followed by intracellular degradation (22Sorice M. Pavan A. Misasi R. Sansolini T. Garofalo T. Lenti L. Pontieri G.M. Frati L. Torrisi M.T. Scand. J. Immunol. 1995; 41: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the CD4 endocytosis due to GM3 was more rapid (5–15 min) than that reported for GM1 (2 h) (23Saggioro D. Sorio C. Calderazzo F. Callegaro L. Panozzo M. Berton G. Chieco-Bianchi L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1368-1375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the specific molecular mechanism(s) triggered by GM3 await(s) further investigation. This work has been undertaken to characterize the early biochemical pathways upstream to the GM3-induced CD4 endocytosis in human T lymphocytes. We presented evidence of PKC involvement, CD4 phosphorylation, and CD4·p56lck dissociation. The possible mechanisms underlying these events have been also analyzed.DISCUSSIONThe aim of this study was to further elucidate our previous observation that the treatment of lymphocytes with GM3 induce CD4 redistribution, clustering, and internalization via endocytic pits and vesicles (22Sorice M. Pavan A. Misasi R. Sansolini T. Garofalo T. Lenti L. Pontieri G.M. Frati L. Torrisi M.T. Scand. J. Immunol. 1995; 41: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Ganglioside-induced CD4 down-modulation has also been reported following treatment with GM1 and shown to trigger a PKC-independent signal responsible for the dissociation of CD4·p56lck complex (21Repke H. Barber E. Ulbricht S. Buchner K. Hucho F. Kopp R. Scholz H. Rudd C.E. Haseltine W.A. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2585-2591PubMed Google Scholar). Primarily, we focused on the different kinetics of the GM3-induced effects. Unlike GM1, which exerts its effect after 2 h (23Saggioro D. Sorio C. Calderazzo F. Callegaro L. Panozzo M. Berton G. Chieco-Bianchi L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1368-1375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), GM3 induces CD4 internalization as early as after 15 min (22Sorice M. Pavan A. Misasi R. Sansolini T. Garofalo T. Lenti L. Pontieri G.M. Frati L. Torrisi M.T. Scand. J. Immunol. 1995; 41: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), an observation consistent with the hypothesis that this molecule triggers peculiar signaling pathway(s).CD4 down-regulation on T cell plasma membrane has also been observed in several functional conditions, such as the antigenic trigger of T-cell receptor complex, the antibody cross-linking of the complex (38Rivas A. Takada S. Koide J. Sonderstrup-McDevitt G. Engleman E.G. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 2912-2918PubMed Google Scholar, 39Cole J.A. McCarthy S.A. Rees M.A. Sharrow S.O. Singer A. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 397-402PubMed Google Scholar), the exposure of CD4+ T cells to phorbol myristate acetate or phorbol dibutyrate (20Hurley T.R. Luo K. Sefton B.M. Science. 1989; 245: 407-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). All these stimuli activate PKC isozymes that cause phosphorylation of the serine residues within the CD4 intracellular domain and thereby lead to the dissociation of CD4·p56lck complex. Interestingly, the abrogation of GM3-induced CD4 endocytosis by different PKC inhibitors suggests that the activation of this enzyme play a key role in this event. A further support to this hypothesis derives from the analysis of cell redistribution of PKC isozymes from cytosol to plasma membrane. This molecular event is generally associated with specific PKC activation (19Marsh M. Pelchen-Matthews A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 205: 107-135PubMed Google Scholar). After GM3 treatment, the Ca2+-independent PKC isozymes PKC-δ and -θ translocate more evidently than -α and -β, as shown by scanning confocal microscopy. In addition, the inhibition of GM3-induced down-modulation of CD4 molecule by rottlerin, a highly specific inhibitor of PKC-δ (26Gschwendt M. Muller H-J. Kielbassa K. Kittstein W. Rincke G. Marks F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), strongly suggests the involvement of PKC-δ. Moreover, we observed that, after addition of GM3, CD4 is rapidly phosphorylated on serine residues and this effect is significantly inhibited in the presence of rottlerin. We also demonstrated that GM3-induced phosphorylation of CD4 molecule correlates with its dissociation from p56lck. This is a fundamental step, which allows the association of CD4 with uncoated and clathrin-coated pits and subsequently the endocytosis and intracellular degradation of the molecule (19Marsh M. Pelchen-Matthews A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 205: 107-135PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sorice M. Pavan A. Misasi R. Sansolini T. Garofalo T. Lenti L. Pontieri G.M. Frati L. Torrisi M.T. Scand. J. Immunol. 1995; 41: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As a whole, these findings indicate that, unlike GM1, which triggers a PKC-independent signal (23Saggioro D. Sorio C. Calderazzo F. Callegaro L. Panozzo M. Berton G. Chieco-Bianchi L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1368-1375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), GM3 may elicit CD4·p56lck dissociation via PKC-δ activation and serine phosphorylation. A different effect of GM3 as against GM1 on receptor phosphorylation has already been reported, such as modulation of EGF receptor activity in A431 cells, induced by GM3, but not GM1 (40Zhou Q. Hakomori S.-I. Kitamura K. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1959-1965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The relevant structural diversity of the glycan moiety of the gangliosides and the different carbohydrate head group affect the physical interactions between gangliosides and proteins and may account for specific ganglioside effects (41Song W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8602-8607Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The observations that GM3-derived 3′ sialyllactose (GM3 molecule lacking the ceramide moiety) and GM3-derived ceramide are unable to induce CD4 down-modulation suggest that the the integrity of the GM3 molecule is required in order to have this effect. Further studies are in progress to analyze the possible effect of gangliosides on different CD4 mutants and so clarify the functional role of glycolipid-protein interactions.Among the possible upstream pathways triggered by exogenous GM3, the observation of the activation of cPLA2 with AA release as early as after 1 min suggests a role for this enzyme in GM3-induced PKC activation and CD4 down-modulation. The hydrolysis products of cPLA2, AA and lyso-PC, are more frequently recognized as lipid second messengers and though to regulate a number of potential molecular targets. AA and lyso-PC are well known molecules directly responsible for the regulation of key intracellular players such as PKC isozymes (42Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2355) Google Scholar). Our results showing that both AA generation and PKC translocation are blocked by AACOCF3, an inhibitor of cPLA2, associate cPLA2 and PKC activations as a result of treatment with GM3. Moreover, it was of interest to analyze the molecular signals triggering GM3-induced cPLA2activation. Our findings indicate that cPLA2 activation may be mediated by ERKs (36Lin L.L. Wartmann M. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R. Cell. 1993; 72: 269-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar, 37Nemenoff R.A. Winitz S. Qian N.-X. Van Putten V. Johnson G.L. Heasley L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1960-1964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a downstream effector of a Ras-regulated cyoplasmic kinase cascade, which includes RAF-1 and MAP kinase kinase (43Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (3188) Google Scholar). Since in our cell system no activation of PI-PLC was observed, this result seems to be in agreement with the finding that U73122, a selective inhibitor of PI-PLC, does not affect GM3-induced CD4 down-modulation and PKC-δ translocation. Other biochemical pathways that may underline the cPLA2-dependent PKC-δ activation following GM3 treatment are under investigation. Since we observed the absence of PI-PLC activity in GM3-treated cells, the link between cPLA2 and PKC-δ activation could be the induction of PC breakdown by PC-specific phospholipases C (PC-PLC) and phospholipase D (44Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 45Van Blitterswljk W.J. Schaap D. van der Bend R.L. Curr. Top. Membr. 1994; 40: 413-437Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), leading to DAG formation without mobilizing Ca2+. These pathways may represent an alternative route for PKC stimulation, particularly the Ca2+-independent isotypes such as PKC-ε and -δ (46Ha K.S. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10534-10539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the ability of AA and/or lysophospholipids to directly activate the Ca2+-independent PKC has been already reported (47Leibersperger H. Gschwendt M. Marks F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16108-16115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,48Knutson K.L. Hoenig M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 62: 543-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar).Exogenously added GM3 may have biological effects similar to endogenously synthesized ones. Specific changes in GSL pattern have been observed during cell growth and differentiation, suggesting that the regulation of their expression on the cell surface represents a precise event. An increase in the activity of GM3 synthase in leukemia cell lines HL-60 or CEM has been observed during differentiation induced by treatment with phorbol ester (49Kiguchi K. Henning-Chubb C. Hubermann E. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 3027-3033PubMed Google Scholar, 50Zeng G. Ariga T. Gu X.B. Yu R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8670-8674Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and the increase of endogenous GM3 expression has been reported following lymphocyte activation with phytohemagglutinin, which activates sialyltransferase, leading to an increased GM3 biosynthesis (51Basu S.K,. Whisler R.L. Yates A.J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2577-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Moreover, we recently reported a 4-fold increase of GM3 concentration at the surface of HIV-infected lymphocytes, which appears to be consistent with the increase of GM3 concentration observed in human normal lymphocytes after incorporation of exogenous GM3 (22Sorice M. Pavan A. Misasi R. Sansolini T. Garofalo T. Lenti L. Pontieri G.M. Frati L. Torrisi M.T. Scand. J. Immunol. 1995; 41: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These results suggest that GM3 may play a role in the CD4 down-modulation occurring during HIV infection (52Misasi R. Sorice M. Griggi T. d'Agostino F. Garofalo T. Masala C. Pontieri G.M. Lenti L. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1993; 67: 216-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 53Sorice M. Garofalo T. Sansolini T. Griggi T. Circella A. Massetti A.P. Tai T. Pavan A. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. Hum. Retroviruses. 1996; 12: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that gangliosides modulate a number of immune functions (54Olshefski R. Taylor B. Heitger A. Hasegawa A. Ladish S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and the down-regulation of CD4 expression may be essential for normal T responses. Indeed, CD4 is associated with the T cell receptor/CD3 complex during T cell activation (55Anderson P. Blue M.-L. Morimoto C. Schlossman S.F. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 678-682PubMed Google Scholar, 56Owens T. Fazekas deS. Groth B. Miller J.F.A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 9209-9213Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and can induce early signaling events following T cell receptor triggering. Interestingly, the coreceptor function mediated via CD4 depends on its association with p56lck (57Baldari C.T. Macchia G. Telford J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4289-4291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which appears, in our experimental conditions, to be regulated by GM3 treatment.The possibility of a functional GM3-CD4 interaction is strongly supported by our previous observations that lymphocyte surface endogenous GM3 is present in relatively detergent-resistant microdomains of the membrane where some proteins, including CD4 and p56lck are highly enriched (8Sorice M. Parolini I. Sansolini T. Garofalo T. Dolo V. Sargiacomo M. Tai T. Peschle C. Torrisi M.R. Pavan A. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 98-109Google Scholar). In particular, CD4 molecules are closely associated with GM3, as demonstrated by the observation that anti-CD4 co-immunoprecipitates GM3 molecules (8Sorice M. Parolini I. Sansolini T. Garofalo T. Dolo V. Sargiacomo M. Tai T. Peschle C. Torrisi M.R. Pavan A. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 98-109Google Scholar). These plasma membrane microdomains of distinct proteins (Src family, PKC, and CD4) and lipids (GM3, cholesterol) correspond to the glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains. They may function as binding factors for many different molecules, including complementary GSL, antibodies, and selectins, and are involved in transducing stimulatory and/or inhibitory cellular signals (58Iwabuchi K. Yamamura S. Prinetti A. Handa K. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9130-9138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 59Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8019) Google Scholar).Altogether, our findings describe a novel mechanism of GM3-triggered CD4 endocytosis in T lymphocytes (summarized in Fig.8), suggesting a role for gangliosides as structural components of a cell membrane multimolecular signaling complex (60Cinek T. Horejisi V. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2262-2270PubMed Google Scholar, 61Kniep B. Cinek T. Angelisova P. Horejsi V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1069-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Gangliosides, sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids, are ubiquitous constituents of cell membranes and have been implicated in a variety of biological events occurring at the cell surface (1Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. Science. 1989; 243: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). Cellular gangliosides have been shown to function as receptors for several different molecules and for bacterial toxins (2Fishman P.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1982; 69: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) and are involved in the binding or release of transmitters (3Cumar F.A. Maggio B. Caputto R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 84: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), regulation of cell cycle (4Usuki S. Hoops P. Sweeley C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10595-10599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cell differentiation (5Bremer E.G. Curr. Top. Membr. 1994; 40: 387-411Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and oncogenic transformation (6Hakomori S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 733-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar). Gangliosides show cell type- and cell differentiation-specific expression patterns. In T lymphocytes, monosialoganglioside GM3 1The abbreviated designations of glycolipids are according to Svennerholm's nomenclature for ganglio series glycopeptides (33Svennerholm L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 24: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (2156) Google Scholar). 1The abbreviated designations of glycolipids are according to Svennerholm's nomenclature for ganglio series glycopeptides (33Svennerholm L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 24: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (2156) Google Scholar). represents the main ganglioside constituent of the plasma membrane (72% of total gangliosides), whereas monosialoganglioside GM1 is not detectable (7Kiguchi K. Henning-Chubb B.C. Huberman E. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 107: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In a previous investigation, we identified GM3-enriched domains on lymphocyte plasma membrane associated with the integral membrane glycoprotein CD4 and its noncovalently linked Src family tyrosine kinase p56lck, suggesting a functional role for GM3-enriched domains in cell-cell interactions, antigen recognition, cell activation and signal transduction (8Sorice M.

Exogenous gangliosides rapidly and significantly bind to biological membranes, modulating the expression and/or the activity of specific surface receptors. Indeed, GM3 is able to down-regulate fibroblast growth factor and epidermal growth factor receptor activities, through the inhibition of tyrosine-kinase activity (9Bremer E.G. Hakomori S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 106: 711-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 10Bremer E.G. Schlessinger J. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2434-2440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); GM1 specifically inhibits platelet-derived growth factor receptor activity and insulin receptor-associated kinase activity (11Bremer E.G. Hakomori S. Bowen-Pope D.F. Raines E. Ross R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6818-6825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and enhances the action of nerve growth factor by binding to Trk, the tyrosine kinase-type receptor for nerve growth factor (12Mutoh T. Tokuda A. Miyadai T. Hamaguchi M. Fujiki N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5087-5091Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Furthermore, exogenous GM1 or binding and cross-linking of endogenous GM1 with B subunit of cholera toxin induces early tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ-1 (13Gouy H. Deterre P. Debré P. Bismuth G. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3271-3281PubMed Google Scholar) and increase of intracellular calcium through a p56lck-dependent pathway (14Gouy H. Deterre P. Debré P. Bismuth G. J.

In this study, the importance of these COOH-terminal domains for biosynthesis of secreted, activable forms of the protease was investigated. Transcripts of the meprin subunit truncated after the protease (α(1–275)), MAM (α(1–452)), and MATH (α(1–528)) domains or with individual domains deleted (ΔMAM, ΔMATH, and ΔAM), were transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells. The wild-type subunit, ΔMATH, ΔAM, α(1–452), and α(1–528) were secreted into the media, although the ΔAM mutant was secreted at very low levels. The ΔMATH and α(1–452) mutants were not activable by limited proteolysis. The α(1–528) mutant was as active as wild-type meprin α against a bradykinin substrate, but had no activity against azocasein, and it, as all other mutants, was more vulnerable to extensive degradation by proteases than the wild-type protein. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that the ΔMAM and α(1–275) mutants were rapidly degraded within cells. Treatment with lactacystin, a specific inhibitor of the proteasome, significantly decreased the degradation, indicating that the mutants lacking the MAM domain are degraded by the proteasome as misfolded proteins.

For example, it has been demonstrated that removal of a 56-amino acid domain in the α subunit (the I domain; see Fig. 1) results in retention of the subunit in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; MAM, meprin, A-5 protein receptor protein-tyrosine phosphate μ; MATH, meprin and TRAF homology; TRAF, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor; AM, after MATH; Endo-H, endoglycosidase H; Endo-F, endoglycosidase F/N-glycosidase F; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BK+, bradykinin analog, 2-aminobenzoyl-Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe-Arg-Lys(Dnp)-Gly-OH, where Dnp is dinitrophenyl. and that mutation of Cys320 in the MAM domain to Ala results in a monomeric secreted, activable at form of the protease that is unstable to heat and proteolytic degradation. Attempts to express enzymatically active or activable forms of the recombinant protease domain of meprin or the protease domain with signal and/or prosequences (in the absence of COOH-terminal domains) have been unsuccessful, in that these proteins are either degraded in the cells or accumulate in inclusion bodies depending on the cell type. 2W. Jiang and J. S. Bond, unpublished observations. These results implied that the noncatalytic, COOH-terminal domains of meprins are important for the secretion and correct folding of the enzyme, although this has not been specifically investigated previously. The deduced amino acid sequences of meprin α and β subunits from mouse, rat, and human cDNA have been determined (Refs. 3Jiang W. Gorbea C.M. Flannery A.V. Beynon R.J. Grant G.A. Bond J.S. J. Biol.

The subunits encode an amino-terminal signal sequence (S), a prosequence (Pro), a protease (astacin-like) domain, a MAM (meprin, A-5 protein, receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase μ) domain, a MATH (meprinand TRAF homology) domain, an AM (after MATH) domain, an epidermal growth factor-like domain, a putative transmembrane-spanning (T) domain, and a cytoplasmic (C) domain (15Tang J. Bond J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The domain structure of the meprin α and β subunits are similar except that meprin α encodes a 56-amino acid sequence (the I or inserted domain) located between the AM and the epidermal growth factor-like domains that is absent in the β subunit (9Marchand P. Tang J. Johnson G.D. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5449-5456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The I domain enables COOH-terminal proteolytic processing of the meprin α subunit at residue Arg615 (near the end of the AM domain) in the ER, so that this subunit is secreted if not associated with a β subunit at the cell surface (9Marchand P.

The MAM domain, which is present in cell surface proteins, consists of about 170 amino acids, contains four or five cysteine residues, and has been shown to play a role in homodimerization of protein-tyrosine phosphatase μ (17Beckman G.

The MATH domain is found in cytosolic proteins such as TRAF (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor) and has been shown to be essential for homodimerization and heterologous interactions with receptor proteins (19Uren A.G.

Functions of the AM domain are unknown, and no homologous sequences have been identified for this domain in proteins other than meprin. In the present study, we investigated the role of the MAM, MATH, and AM domains in secretion, folding, and activity of the meprin α subunit by mutational (see Fig. 1) and transfection analyses.

The COOH-terminal truncation and deletion mutants (Fig. 1) were generated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) by methods described previously (15Tang J. Bond J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The truncation mutants were constructed by PCR using mutagenic antisense primers. The α(1–275) transcript was constructed by changing the codon of the wild-type transcript at Thr276 to a stop codon. For the α(1–452) transcript, the codon for Ile453 was changed to a stop codon. For the α(1–528) transcript, Ala529 was changed to a stop codon. The deletion mutants were constructed by the methods of Higuchi using primers containing 5′ add on sequence overlapping sequences (21Higuchi Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego1990: 177-183Google Scholar). The ΔAM mutant was constructed by fusing the NH2-terminal fragment of Met1–Glu528 with the COOH-terminal fragment of Arg628–Glu760 using primers in the PCR amplification such as 5′-CATAATGACCATCCTGGACCAGGAAAGAGGCCTCCTTCTGCAAG3′ and 5′-CTTGCAGAAGGAGGCCTCTTTCCTGGTCCAGGATGGTCATTATG-3′. The ΔMATH mutant was constructed by fusing Met1–Ala445 with Arg529–Glu760 using the PCR amplification primers 5′-CTGACAGAAACCCCCTGCCCTGCA-GCTGATACCAGGAACAGGATGTCC-3′ and 5′-GGACATCCTGTTCCTGGTATCAGC-TGCAGGGCAGGGGGTTTTCTGTCAG-3′. The ΔMAM mutant was constructed with Met1–His275 and Gly446– Glu760 using the PCR amplification primers 5′-TACAACTGCACCGCAACACATGGGGTTTGGACCACTCGGAAATA-3′ and 5′-TATTCCGGATGGTCCAAACCCCATGTGTTGCGGTGCAGTTG-3′. These NH2-terminal and the COOH-terminal fragments were separately constructed, and then both fragments were extended withPfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). All PCR reactions were constructed with Pfu DNA polymerase to minimize base misincorporations. All constructs were verified as correct by DNA sequence analyses. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (ATCC 1573 CRL) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. The recombinant meprin α wild-type or mutants were expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells after transfection by the calcium phosphate precipitation method using 10 μg of expression plasmid and 1 μg of helper plasmid pVA1/100-mm tissue culture plate (9Marchand P. Tang J. Johnson G.D. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5449-5456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to approximately 90% confluence by overnight incubation in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Then the medium was replaced with serum-free Opti-MEM (5 ml/plate) and returned to the incubator for an additional 48 h. The tissue culture media were collected after 48 h of transfection and were subjected to centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant fractions were concentrated 10-fold to 500 μl/plate using Centriprep-30 and Microcon-30 concentrators (Amicon, Inc.). The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), removed from the plates with a rubber scraper, and subjected to centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min. The sedimented cells were suspended in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, sonicated for 1 min at 4 °C, and subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h; the supernatant fraction is referred to as the cell lysate. The transfected cells were preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking methionine supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. The cells were pulse-labeled for 10–30 min with [35S]methionine/cysteine (100 μCi/ml/dish), and then chased in fresh serum-free Opti-MEM (1.5 ml/plate). At indicated times, the cells were separated from the medium, washed twice with PBS, lysed in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% sodium azide, and proteinase inhibitors (antipain, chymostatin, leupeptin, pepstatin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and subsequently sonicated for 1 min. The media were subjected to centrifugation at 6,500 × g for 10 min. The cells and media were mixed with 40 μl of Pansorbin for 1 h at 4 °C to prevent nonspecific binding to IgG-protein A complexes, and then centrifuged at 6,500 × g for 30 min. The supernatant fractions were incubated with 15 μl of anti-mouse meprin α IgG at 37 °C for 10 min, and then stored at 4 °C for 16 h. The immunocomplexes were mixed with 40 μl of Protein A-Sepharose beads (50% gel suspension) for 3 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The beads were washed three times with 0.1% SDS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 200 mmEDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), washed another three times with the same buffer containing 1 m NaCl and 0.1% sodium lauryl sarcosinate, and then washed twice with 5 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.0). The sedimented beads were boiled for 5 min at 100 °C with 50 ml of 0.1% SDS, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5% sucrose, 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) with 2-mercaptoethanol. The supernatant fractions were subjected to electrophoresis using 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (22Laemmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (9Marchand P. Tang J. Johnson G.D. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5449-5456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The proteins were probed with one of two different antibodies, which had been produced by injection of meprin antigen into rabbits. In one instance, the purified mouse meprin had been deglycosylated prior to injection (referred to as anti-deglycosylated antibody); the second antibody was produced in response to native meprin antigen (anti-α antibody). Meprin subunits were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Pierce). The immunoprecipitated or secreted proteins were denatured by boiling for 5 min at 100 °C with 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.2% SDS. The samples were adjusted to a final concentration of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.0), containing 0.75% Triton X-100 and 100 μg/ml protease inhibitors such as antipain, chymostatin, leupeptin, pepstatin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The mixtures were added to 10 milliunits of Endo-H or 1.0 unit of Endo-F, and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. Reactions were stopped by boiling the samples in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Trypsin was added to the secreted proteins at the final concentration of 10 ng/μl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After incubation at 25 °C for 30 min, soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma, type II-S) was added at a 2-fold excess of trypsin. Samples were incubated at 25 °C for 15 min and then kept at 4 °C until analysis. For proteolytic susceptibility studies, trypsin was added to the secreted proteins at 10, 20, 30, or 40 ng/μl, and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Endoproteinase Arg-C (Boehringer Mannheim) was used to activate meprin subunits at a concentration of 40 ng/μl. After 30 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped with 0.3 mm 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin. A fluorogenic bradykinin analog (BK+) 2-aminobenzoyl-Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe-Arg-Lys(Dnp)-Gly-OH, where Dnp is dinitrophenyl, obtained from Dr. Graham Knight (Strangeways Research Laboratory, Cambridge, United Kingdom), was used as a substrate. Activity against BK+ was measured as described previously (10Marchand P. Volkmann M. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24236-24241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For specific activity calculations, the amount of meprin protein in each sample was determined by immunoblotting and densitometry (10Marchand P. Volkmann M. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24236-24241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Azocaseinase activity was measured as described previously (1Bond J.S. Beynon R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1247-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 11Wolz R.L. Bond J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 325-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). When the wild-type mouse meprin α subunit cDNA was transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells, the protein was secreted into the medium with a molecular mass of approximately 95 kDa (Fig.2 A, lane 2). A small amount of the expressed meprin α subunit was found associated with cell lysates (Fig. 2 A, lane 1); this component had a molecular mass of approximately 90 kDa. Truncated mutants α(1–528), α(1–452), and the ΔMATH deletion mutant were also detected as immunoreactive, secreted proteins with molecular masses of approximately 90, 75, and 92 kDa, respectively. By contrast, mutants α(1–275), ΔMAM, and ΔAM were undetectable by immunoblot analysis of the cell lysates and media (Fig. 2 A, lanes 7–10, 13, and 14). Repeated analyses revealed that the expression levels of all the mutants in the media were lower than the wild-type, but deletion of the MAM domain (ΔMAM), truncation just before the MAM domain (α(1–275)), and deletion of the AM domain (ΔAM) yielded the lowest levels of secreted protein (Fig.2 B). When the secreted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE in the absence of β-mercaptoethanol, all migrated as dimers (data not shown). Thus, the intersubunit S-S bridging was maintained in secreted mutants as in the wild-type. To determine whether the secreted mutants contained complex oligosaccharides as the wild-type (9Marchand P. Tang J. Johnson G.D. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5449-5456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), they were treated with Endo-H and Endo-F (Fig. 3). The α(1–528), ΔMATH, and α(1–452) proteins were all resistant to Endo-H, and sensitive to Endo-F, indicating complex glycosylation had occurred. Endo-F treatment decreased the molecular mass of the wild-type from about 95 to 75 kDa (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and3); the α(1–528) mutant from approximately 90 to 70 kDa (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 6); the ΔMATH mutant was from about 92 to 72 kDa (Fig. 3, lanes 7 and 9); and the α(1–452) mutant was shifted from approximately 75 to 65 kDa (Fig. 3, lanes 10 and 12). The deglycosylated proteins all migrated slower on gels than their predicted molecular sizes (by about 10 kDa), but as predicted relative to each other. Endo-F treatment decreased the molecular masses of the wild-type, α(1–528), and ΔMATH mutants approximately 20 kDa, as assessed by mobility after SDS-PAGE. The α(1–452) mutant lost approximately 10 kDa upon treatment with Endo-F. The decreased mass lost from the latter mutant relative to others may be due to the absence of the MATH and AM domains, both of which contain potential glycosylation sites. Meprin α subunits are secreted as inactive proenzymes and must be treated with trypsin-like proteinases for the conversion of the zymogen to the active mature enzyme (11Wolz R.L. Bond J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 325-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 12Chestukhin A. Litovchick L. Muradov K. Batkin M. Shaltiel S. J. Biol.

To test whether secreted mutants α(1–528), α(1–452), and ΔMATH were correctly folded proteins and activable enzymes, the mutants were treated with trypsin and Arg-C, under conditions used for limited proteolysis of the wild-type enzyme, and catalytic activities were measured against a bradykinin analog (BK+) and azocasein. After incubation with 40 ng/μl endoprotease Arg-C at 37 °C for 30 min, the wild-type and the secreted mutants α(1–528), α(1–452) and ΔMATH migrated faster on polyacrylamide gels than nontreated proteins, indicating limited proteolysis (Fig. 4 A). Prior to treatment with Arg-C neither wild-type nor mutants had activity. After the limited proteolysis, the wild-type and α(1–528) mutant proteins had comparable activities against the bradykinin substrate. However, the mutants lacking the MATH domain (ΔMATH and the α(1–452) mutant) had no detectable activity (Table I). Activity of all mutants against azocasein was markedly decreased. The α(1–528) mutant had a 10-fold decreased activity against the protein substrate compared with the wild-type, and no activity of the mutants lacking MATH domain could be detected with azocasein. These results indicate that the mutants were synthesized as proforms, that the MATH domain is necessary for synthesis of an enzymatically activable protease (against peptide and protein substrates), and that the AM domain is necessary for generation of activity against protein substrates but not against small peptides such as bradykinin.Table ISpecific activity of secreted wild-type and mutant meprinsSamplesBK+Azocaseinμmol/min/mgunits/mgWild-type2.10 ± 0.218485 ± 265α-(1–528)1.89 ± 0.20324 ± 176α-(1–452)NDNDΔMATHNDNDSecreted wild-type and mutants were activated with endoproteinase Arg-C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Activity was determined using 24 μm fluorogenic bradykinin analog (BK+) or 11 μg/μl azocasein as substrates.

Notable differences in the vulnerability to extensive degradation by trypsin were also observed between the wild-type and secreted mutant proteins. The wild-type and α(1–528) mutant were resistant to general proteolysis when treated with 10 ng/μl trypsin, while limited proteolysis at this trypsin concentration shifted the proforms to the enzymatically active forms (Fig. 4 B,lanes 1–4). However, under the same conditions, the ΔMATH and α(1–452) mutants were extensively degraded (Fig. 4 B,lanes 5–8). Differences in the susceptibility between the wild-type and the α(1–528) mutant were found when they were treated with a higher concentration of trypsin (Fig. 4 C). The α(1–528) mutant was extensively degraded by 20–40 ng/μl of trypsin (Fig. 4 C, lanes 7 and 8), whereas the wild-type was resistant to proteolysis (Fig. 4 C,lanes 3 and 4). These results indicate that the mutants lacking the MATH domain were not correctly folded to generate active enzymes, while the mutant lacking the AM domain (α(1–528)) had a correctly folded protease domain for generation of peptidase activity, but lacked proper structure"
https://openalex.org/W2039159306,"Signaling across integrins is regulated by interaction of these receptors with cytoskeletal proteins and signaling molecules. To identify molecules interacting with the cytoplasmic domain of the β3-integrin subunit (glycoprotein IIIa), a placental cDNA library was screened in the yeast two-hybrid system. Two identical clones coding for a 96-amino acid sequence were identified. This sequence was 100% identical to a sequence in skelemin, a protein identified previously in skeletal muscle. Skelemin is a member of a superfamily of cytoskeletal proteins that contain fibronectin-type III-like motifs and immunoglobulin C2-like motifs and that regulate the organization of myosin filaments in muscle. The amino acid residues in the isolated clones encompassed C2 motifs 4 and 5 of skelemin. A recombinant skelemin protein consisting of C2 motifs 3–7 interacted with β1- and β3-integrin cytoplasmic domains expressed as glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, but not with GST-β2-integrin cytoplasmic tail or GST alone. The skelemin-binding region was in the membrane proximal cytoplasmic domains of the integrins. Full-length skelemin interacted with integrin in intact cells as demonstrated by the colocalization of hemagglutinin-tagged skelemin in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells containing αIIbβ3-integrin and by the finding that microinjection of C2 motif 4 of skelemin into C2C12 mouse myoblast cells caused spread cells to round up. A skelemin-like protein was detected in CHO cells, endothelial cells, and platelets, and this protein colocalized with β1- and β3-integrins in CHO cells. This study suggests the presence of a skelemin-like protein in non-muscle cells and provides evidence that it may be involved in linking integrins to the cytoskeleton.

To elucidate the mechanisms involved in transmission of signals across integrins, it will be important to identify the intracellular proteins with which the cytoplasmic tails interact. Immunofluorescence studies in cultured cells have identified numerous cytoskeletal proteins and signaling molecules that colocalize with integrins in focal adhesions (11Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). Some of these molecules, such as talin, α-actinin, and focal adhesion kinase, have been shown to bind directly to the cytoplasmic domain of β1- or β3-integrin in in vitro assays (30Horwitz A.

Additional integrin-binding proteins have been identified using integrin cytoplasmic domains in a yeast two-hybrid screen. For example, integrin-linked kinase (35Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1149-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) have been identified using the β1-integrin cytoplasmic domain; endonexin was identified using the β3-integrin cytoplasmic domain (37Shattil S.J. O'Toole T. Eigenthaler M. Thon V. Williams M. Babior B.M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar); and the SEC7 homologue cytohesin was identified using the β2-integrin cytoplasmic domain (38Kolanus W. Nagel W. Schiller B.

Yet other proteins such as CIB (calcium- andintegrin-binding protein) and calreticulin (39Naik U.P. Patel P.M. Parise L.V. J. Biol.

Potential functions for endonexin, integrin-linked kinase, cytohesin, and calreticulin in regulating integrin function have been described (38Kolanus W. Nagel W. Schiller B. Zeitlmann L. Godar S.

In this study, we have employed the yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins that interact with the β3-integrin cytoplasmic domain. We have (i) identified a specific interaction between this integrin and a previously characterized muscle cytoskeletal protein known as skelemin, (ii) shown that skelemin also interacts with the β1-integrin cytoplasmic domain, (iii) identified the regions on the integrins involved in the interaction, (iv) demonstrated colocalization of a skelemin-like protein with integrin in cultured cells, and (v) shown that microinjection of the binding domain of skelemin into cultured cells leads to altered cell morphology. Because skelemin is present in the M-band of skeletal muscle, where it is thought to regulate the organization of myosin filaments, it appears possible that skelemin could mediate the interaction of integrins with myosin, thereby taking part in the regulation of integrin-induced cytoskeletal reorganizations and cell spreading. The yeast two-hybrid system (44Fields S. Song O.-K. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4863) Google Scholar) was employed to identify the proteins that interact with the β3-integrin cytoplasmic tail. A human placental Matchmaker cDNA library and yeast two-hybrid system vectors were purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). The human cDNAs coding for αIIb and β3 were obtained from Dr. Laurence Fitzgerald (University of Utah). The cytoplasmic domain of β3-integrin (corresponding to residues 715–762) was cloned into pGBT9, containing the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. The yeast strain HF7c (MATa, ura3-52, his3-200, lys2-801, ade2-101, trp1-901, leu2-3,112, gal4-542, gal80-538, LYS2::GAL1-HIS3, URA3::(GAL4 17-mers)3-CYC1-lacZ) was first transformed with pGBT9 DNA-binding vector containing the β3-integrin cytoplasmic tail, and colonies were selected on synthetic complete medium plates lacking tryptophan. A single Trp+ colony was amplified and transformed with a human placental cDNA expression library. The transformants were selected at 30 °C on synthetic complete medium plates lacking Trp, Leu, and His and containing 10 mm 3-aminotriazole. After 7–10 days, His+colonies were tested for β-galactosidase activity. The cDNAs from the positive clones were isolated and sequenced. The cytoplasmic domains of β1-, β2-, and β3-integrins were expressed as GST 1The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HA, hemagglutinin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. fusion proteins. Chicken GST-β1-integrin cytoplasmic tail (corresponding to residues 751–798) was a gift from Dr. Richard Hynes (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). The cDNA for human β2 was a gift from Dr. Li Zhang (Cleveland Clinic Foundation). The β2-integrin cytoplasmic domain (corresponding to residues 723–769) was polymerase chain reaction-amplified using the primers 5′-GGG GGA TCC TGG AGG GCT CTG ATC CAC CTG-3′ and 5′-AAA GGA TCC CTA ACT CTC AGC AAA CTT GGG-3′. The cytoplasmic domain of β3 (corresponding to residues 715–762) was polymerase chain reaction-amplified using the primers 5′-GGG GGA TCC TGG AAA CTC CTC ATC ACC ATC-3′ and 5′-GGG GGA TCC TTA AGT GCC CCG GTA CGT GAT-3′. The cytoplasmic regions were cloned in frame into pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Expression and purification of the GST proteins were essentially as described by Smith and Johnson (45Smith D. Johnson K. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Expression was confirmed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Protein concentrations were assayed by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad), and equal amounts of each subunit were used in the binding assays. Regions corresponding to various domains of skelemin were expressed as His-tagged proteins or GST fusion proteins, subjected to thrombin cleavage (100 units of thrombin/liter of culture), and radiolabeled using IODO-GEN (Sigma) (46Fraker P.J. Speck Jr., J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay. Forin vitro binding assays, radiolabeled skelemin domains were incubated with β-integrin tails that were bound to GST beads. All incubations were performed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 6 h. The GST beads were washed four times in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, and the radiolabeled protein remaining bound to the beads was counted in a γ-counter (20/20 series, Iso-Data, Encinitas, CA) or solubilized by addition of an SDS-containing buffer in the presence of reducing agent and electrophoresed through 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described previously (47Fox J.E.B. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4120-4126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactivity was detected by autoradiography of dried gels. Peptides corresponding to the cytoplasmic regions of both β1- and β3-integrins were synthesized by Multiple Peptide Systems (San Diego, CA). 100 μl of various peptides (2 mg/ml in water) were coated overnight onto plastic wells (Nunc immunoplates). The wells were blocked for 2 h with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, incubated with radiolabeled skelemin (C2 motifs 3–7) for 6 h at room temperature, and washed extensively in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and the bound radioactivity was extracted in 100 μl of 3 n sodium hydroxide and quantified in a γ-counter. CHO cells (ATCC CCL61) were routinely grown in nutrient mixture F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The full-length cDNAs for the human αIIb- and β3-subunits were cloned into pDX vector (48Lopez J.A. Leung B. Reynolds C.C. Li C.Q. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12851-12859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CHO cells were transfected with 5 μg each of αIIb and β3 cDNAs and 2 μg of pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Stable cell lines expressing αIIbβ3 were selected in growth medium containing 500 μg/ml G418. The expression of αIIbβ3 at the cell surface was detected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis using an antibody that recognizes the αIIbβ3 complex (Immunotech, Inc., Westbrook, ME). Cells were stained with the monoclonal antibody and with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) and analyzed with a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson Advanced Cellular Biology, San Jose, CA) as described previously (49Meyer S. Zuerbig S. Bissel T. Cunningham C.C. Hartwig J.H. Fox J.E.B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 73 (abstr.): 1153Google Scholar). An HA tag (YPYDVPDYASL) was added to the C terminus of mouse skelemin by polymerase chain reaction. The CHO cells containing αIIbβ3 were transiently transfected with 5 μg of the cDNA encoding HA-tagged skelemin. The distribution of αIIbβ3 and HA-tagged skelemin was detected by immunofluorescence 24 h after transfection. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against skelemin were raised using the recombinant C2 motifs 3–7 of skelemin as immunogen. The specificity of these antibodies was tested by immunoblot analysis. Tissue extracts from cardiac and skeletal muscles were purchased fromCLONTECH. 30 μg of total protein were solubilized in SDS sample buffer, separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blots were incubated with anti-skelemin antibodies, and antigen-antibody complexes were detected by chemiluminescence (Amersham International). Confluent cultures of C2C12 mouse skeletal myogenic cells (ATCC CRL1772), CHO cells, and bovine aortic endothelial cells (gift of Dr. Paul Dicorleto, Cleveland Clinic Foundation) were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 1% Triton X-100 for 20 min on ice. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × gfor 10 min. 2 mg of total protein from the soluble fractions were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-skelemin antibodies. Control antibodies including normal rabbit IgG and anti-CD61 (an antibody against platelet β3-integrin subunit) (Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA) were also employed. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed on Western blots for the presence of a protein reacting with the skelemin antibodies. CHO cells or bovine aortic endothelial cells were grown on fibronectin-coated coverslips (Becton Dickinson) in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum for 2–16 h. Cells were fixed in 1.4% formaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized by addition of a buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS (pH 7.4), washed three times in PBS, and blocked with PBS containing 10% bovine serum. The fixed cells were incubated for 3 h with a monoclonal antibody against the β3-integrin subunit (Becton Dickinson) and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against skelemin or the HA tag (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Specimens were washed five times and incubated with FITC-labeled anti-mouse Ig and Texas Red-labeled anti-rabbit Ig (Amersham International). Images were collected using a Leica TCS-NT confocal laser-scanning microscope. Control samples were prepared using secondary antibodies alone or irrelevant primary antibodies. Lasers were adjusted so that the excitation of the fluorochromes did not allow any cross-talk between the channels. C2C12 myoblast cells were grown on gridded coverslips (Bellco, Vineland, NJ). Recombinant proteins (3 mg/ml) were co-injected with FITC-dextran (Sigma) at a final concentration of 0.5%. The proteins were injected using a micromanipulator (Model 5171, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) at an injection pressure of 70 hectopascals for 0.35 s. 2 h after microinjection, the cells were fixed and permeabilized as described above for CHO cells. Cells were incubated for 1 h with trimethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-labeled phalloidin (Sigma) and examined with a Zeiss Universal microscope. To identify proteins with which the cytoplasmic domain of β3-integrin interacts, a yeast two-hybrid screen (44Fields S. Song O.-K. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4863) Google Scholar) was performed. The entire cytoplasmic domain of the β3-subunit (residues 715–762) was fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and was used to screen a human placental Matchmaker cDNA library. Of ∼2 × 106 independent clones plated, 10 grew in the absence of histidine and also expressed β-galactosidase activity. Two of these clones (P7 and P9) had ∼1100-base pair inserts and retained their β-galactosidase activity in secondary as well as tertiary screenings. They failed to interact with control proteins such as p53, lamin C, or the cytoplasmic tail of αIIb-integrin (residues 1018–1039) in the two-hybrid screen (data not shown). cDNAs isolated from other His+clones either had short reading frames or did not support β-galactosidase activity in the subsequent screenings. The cDNA sequences of the two positive clones were identical and had an open reading frame encoding 96 amino acids. The DNA sequence of the clones was compared with known sequences in the GenBankTM Data Bank and shown to be identical to a sequence in a previously identified muscle-specific protein known as skelemin (50Price M.G. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21800-21810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Skelemin belongs to a family of myosin-associated proteins and is thought to play a role in maintaining the organization of myosin filaments in muscle (50Price M.G. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21800-21810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Price M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1325-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The protein contains five repeats of fibronectin type III-like motifs and seven immunoglobulin superfamily C2-like motifs (Fig. 1 A). The protein sequence of the clones obtained from the two-hybrid screen was identical to residues 1087–1183 of human skelemin. This sequence is located within C2 motifs 4 and 5 (Fig. 1 A, represented by afilled bar). To determine whether the β3-integrin cytoplasmic domain interacted with skelemin in an assay other than the two-hybrid system, we expressed either the middle region of skelemin containing fibronectin type III-like motifs 1–5 or the C-terminal portion of skelemin containing the immunoglobulin superfamily C2-like motifs 3–7 in Escherichia coli. Since the human and mouse skelemins exhibit a high degree of sequence homology, we chose to express the mouse protein for these studies. (With the exception of a few conservative substitutions, the sequence of the clones obtained from the two-hybrid system was identical to residues 1302–1398 in C2 motifs 4 and 5 of mouse skelemin (50Price M.G. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21800-21810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Vinkemeier U. Obermann W. Weber K. Fuerst D.O. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 319-330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).) Increasing amounts of radiolabeled recombinant skelemin domains were incubated with recombinant β3-integrin cytoplasmic domain that was bound to GST beads. Skelemin bound to the GST beads was solubilized in an SDS-containing buffer and electrophoresed through SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The radiolabeled skelemin domains were detected by autoradiography. Radiolabeled fibronectin motifs 1–5 did not bind to GST-β3-integrin cytoplasmic domain, whereas radiolabeled C2 motifs 3–7 did (Fig.1 B). The interaction between the C-terminal C2 motifs 3–7 of skelemin and the β3- cytoplasmic domain was specific as shown by negligible binding of the motifs to GST alone (Fig.2 A). Furthermore, the interaction was dose-dependent and saturable (Fig.2 B). The cytoplasmic domain of the β3-integrin subunit has a high degree of sequence homology to the cytoplasmic domain of the β1-integrin subunit (∼60%) (Fig.3 A). In contrast, it has only ∼25% homology to the cytoplasmic domain of the β2-integrin subunit. To determine whether skelemin interacts with β-integrins other than β3, the cytoplasmic domains of chicken β1-integrin (residues 756–803) and human β2-integrin (residues 723–769) subunits (Fig. 3 A) were expressed as GST fusion proteins. An equal amount of each subunit was incubated with radiolabeled recombinant skelemin C2 motifs 3–7. Like GST-β3, GST-β1 bound to radiolabeled recombinant skelemin C2 motifs 3–7 (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, there was no specific binding of GST-β2 to skelemin C2 motifs 3–7. To identify the sequences in the β1- and β3-integrin subunits that mediate the interaction with skelemin C2 motifs 3–7, three consecutive peptides encompassing the entire cytoplasmic domains of both integrins were synthesized (β1-3 and β3-3) (Fig.4 A). These peptides were tested for their ability to bind to radiolabeled skelemin C2 motifs 3–7. Fig. 4 B shows that the membrane proximal 15–17-residue peptides (β1-1 and β3-1) of the integrin subunits exhibited maximal binding of the radiolabeled skelemin C2 motifs. The other peptides bound negligible amounts of the radiolabeled protein. In addition, the αIIb-integrin cytoplasmic domain bound negligible amounts of radiolabeled protein. To further define the sequence within the β3-integrin cytoplasmic domain that interacts with skelemin, we synthesized various overlapping peptides that correspond to the membrane proximal region of the β3-subunit (Fig.5 A). Fig. 5 B shows that a peptide that lacked the five C-terminal amino acids of β3-1 (β3-4) still bound recombinant skelemin C2 motifs. However, a peptide lacking an additional three amino acids (β3-5) was unable to bind skelemin. Further, peptides β3-7 and β3-8, which lack the most membrane proximal amino acids, did not bind skelemin. Therefore, the minimal peptide sequence that supports the interaction of the β3-subunit with skelemin C2 motifs 3–7 is WKLLITIHDRK.Figure 5Binding of radiolabeled skelemin (C2 motifs 3–7) to immobilized β3-integrin membrane proximal peptides. The sequences of the membrane proximal peptides are shown in A. (The amino-terminal tryptophan was replaced by cysteine in the β3-1 peptide.) Binding of125I-labeled skelemin motifs to these peptides was measured as described in the legend to Fig. 4. The results shown in Bare representative of two independent experiments performed in duplicate. The specific activity of the labeled protein was 53,000 cpm/pmol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The data presented so far demonstrate that the β1- and β3-integrin cytoplasmic domains interact with recombinant skelemin in in vitroassays and that this interaction is mediated through the membrane proximal sequences of the β-integrin cytoplasmic tails. C2 motifs 3–7 of skelemin were used in the experiments described so far. However, the sequence of the two clones originally obtained from the two-hybrid screen was contained within C2 motifs 4 and 5. To gain insight into the C2 motif that contained the binding site for the integrin cytoplasmic domain, C2 motifs 4 (residues 1207–1328) and 5 (residues 1332–1433) were expressed individually. Both motifs were able to inhibit the binding of radiolabeled C2 motifs 3–7 to GST-β3-coated plates (Fig.6). Fibronectin repeats did not show any detectable inhibition (data not shown). The experiments described so far demonstrate that fr"

Our previous studies showed that the three terminal uridylic acid residues of human SRP RNA are post-transcriptionally removed and a single adenylic acid residue is added, resulting in a 3′ end sequence of -GUCUCUAOH(Sinha, K. M., Gu, J., Chen, Y., and Reddy, R. (1998)J. Biol. Chem. 273, 6853–6859). In this study we show that the Alu RNA, corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ ends of SRP RNA, is also accurately processed and adenylated in vitro. Alu RNAs containing 7 or 11 additional nucleotides on the 3′ end were accurately processed and then adenylated. Deletion analysis showed that an 87-nucleotide-long motif comprising of the 5′ and 3′ ends, including stem IV of the Alu RNA, is sufficient and necessary for the 3′ end processing and adenylation. A 73-nucleotide-long construct with deletion of stem IV, required for the binding of SRP 9/14-kDa proteins, was neither processed nor adenylated. The adenylated Alu RNA as well as adenylated SRP RNA were bound to the SRP 9/14-kDa heterodimer and were immunoprecipitated by specific antibodies. A significant fraction of SRP RNA in the nucleoli was found to be processed and adenylated. These data are consistent with nascent SRP and/or Alu RNAs first binding to SRP 9/14-kDa protein heterodimer, followed by the removal of extra sequence on the 3′ end and then the addition of one adenylic acid residue in the nucleus, before transport into the cytoplasm.

Most eukaryotic RNAs are processed after transcription. These processes include capping, polyadenylation, splicing, CCA turnover on the 3′ end of tRNAs, modification of base, sugar or phosphate moieties, etc. In the case of human small RNAs like U1, U2, and U4 snRNAs, 1The abbreviations used are: sn, small nuclear; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; SRP, signal recognition particle. 1The abbreviations used are: sn, small nuclear; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; SRP, signal recognition particle.it is known that several nucleotides are removed from the 3′ end of the primary transcript to generate mature RNA molecules. In all these cases, precursor RNAs bind the snRNP proteins and the RNP is used as the substrate for processing (1Madore S.J. Wieben E.D. Kunkel G.R. Pederson T. J.

In addition to the removal of several nucleotides from the 3′ end of the primary transcript, we recently showed that, in the case of many human small RNAs, a single adenylic acid residue is added. The human small RNAs processed and adenylated in this manner include human SRP RNA, 7 SK RNA, U2 snRNA, and ribosomal 5 S RNA (10Sinha K.M. Gu J. Chen Y. Reddy R. J. Biol.

Human SRP RNA is transcribed by RNA polymerase III (18Zieve G. Benecke B.-J. Penman S. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4520-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and the 5′ and 3′ end portions of SRP RNA are over 80% homologous to the highly repeated Alu sequences in the primate genomes (19Weiner A.M. Cell. 1980; 22: 209-218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 20Li W.-Y. Reddy R. Henning D. Epstein P. Busch H. J. Biol.

Studies have shown that the Alu sequence of the SRP RNA is the progenitor of the highly repeated Alu interspersed elements (21Ullu E. Murphy S. Melli M. Cell. 1982; 29: 195-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar,25Ullu E. Tschudi C. Nature. 1984; 312: 171-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). It appears that Alu sequences arose from the removal of the middle portion (S fragment) of the SRP RNA, reverse transcription, and integration of the DNA into the genome (22Weiner A.M. Deininger P.L. Efstratiadis A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 631-661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Ullu E. Tschudi C. Nature. 1984; 312: 171-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The SRP consists of two distinct functional domains. The first one is the Alu domain consisting of the 5′ and the 3′ end portions of SRP RNA associated with two proteins, the 9- and 14-kDa protein heterodimer (26Gundelfinger E.D. Krause E. Melli M. Dobberstein B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 7363-7364Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 27Strub K. Moss J. Walter P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3949-3959Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The 5′ end of the Alu domain has a tRNA-like structure and plays an important role in arresting the elongation of nascent peptide in the ribosome (28Wolin S.L. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2617-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 29Siegel V. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1913-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The minimal domain necessary for binding with 9/14-kDa protein heterodimer is an 86-nucleotide-long domain including 5′ end, 3′ end, and stems III and IV (see Fig. 3, A andB) in the Alu portion of SRP RNA (30Weichenrieder O. Kapp U. Cusack S. Strub K. RNA. 1997; 3: 1262-1274PubMed Google Scholar). The second functional domain consists of the SRP RNA-specific S fragment and four SRP proteins. This domain is responsible for targeting the ribosome-nascent peptide chain complex to the surface of rough endoplasmic reticulum by interacting with SRP receptor (reviewed in Refs. 13Walter P. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar and 31Siegel V. Walter P. Trends Biol. Sci. 1988; 13: 314-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Recently, Jacobson and Pederson (32Jacobson M.R. Pederson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7981-7986Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) showed that SRP RNA, when injected into the nucleoplasm, first migrates to the nucleolus and then to the cytoplasm. Deletion analysis showed that the minimal domain necessary for migration from the nucleoplasm to the nucleolus is an 86-nucleotide-long domain including 5′ end, 3′ end, stem III, and stem IV in the Alu portion of SRP RNA (32Jacobson M.R. Pederson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7981-7986Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These studies show that the SRP motif involved in binding 9/14-kDa protein heterodimer and migration from nucleoplasm via the nucleolus on its way to cytoplasm is the same (30Weichenrieder O. Kapp U. Cusack S. Strub K. RNA. 1997; 3: 1262-1274PubMed Google Scholar, 32Jacobson M.R. Pederson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7981-7986Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Maraia and colleagues (33Sarrowa J. Chang D.-Y. Maraia R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1144-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) carried out studies on the biogenesis of Alu RNA in primates including humans. In humans, the primary transcript of Alu RNA is dimeric with left and right monomers. In some of the dimeric Alu RNAs, only the left monomer but not the right monomer can bind the SRP 9/14-kDa protein heterodimer with high affinity. The loss of Alu right monomer affinity for SRP9/14 binding is associated with the accumulation of Alu RNA in the cytoplasm containing only the left monomer. Export of SRP RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm involves Alu domain and Alu domain competes with SRP RNA in the nucleus for limiting transport factors (34Xe X.-P. Bataille N. Fried H.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 903-912PubMed Google Scholar). These and other studies show that common proteins bind to SRP and Alu RNAs, and it is likely that there is a common maturation pathway for both Alu and SRP RNAs. In this study, we show that the minimal domain necessary for 3′ end processing and adenylation is again an 87-nucleotide long domain including 5′ end, 3′ end, stem III, and stem IV in the Alu portion of SRP RNA. These data show that this tRNA-like domain of SRP RNA has multiple functions in the biogenesis of SRP RNA, including binding of 9/14-kDa protein heterodimer, 3′ end processing, adenylation, and migration to the nucleolus on its way to the cytoplasm. [α-32P]ATP and [α-32P]CTP were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other chemicals including micrococcal nuclease and T2 RNase were obtained from Sigma. T1 RNase and Taq DNA polymerase were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. T7 RNA polymerase and all other restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs. The TA cloning kit was from Invitrogen, and the PCR DNA product purification kit was from QIAGEN. To prepare the Human SRP RNA, DNA template amplified by PCR was transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase. The SRP RNA obtained in this manner contained three uridylic acid residues on the 3′ end. Plasmid DNA containing Alu portion of canine SRP RNA (p7Alu) under T7 promoter was a gift from Dr. Katharina Strub (27Strub K. Moss J. Walter P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3949-3959Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This Alu sequence was altered by PCR in order to insert a DraI site on its 3′ end and was cloned into pUC19 vector by insertion into EcoRI andHindIII sites. The Alu RNA was transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase from the DNA template linearized by DraI, and the transcribed RNA contained three uridylic acids on the 3′ end.Alu161+7 and Alu161+11 RNAs were transcribed from the plasmid DNA template linearized by HindIII and DNA obtained by PCR amplification, respectively. All the deletion mutants of Alu RNA were constructed by PCR-mediated mutagenesis and cloned into pUC19 vector (Alu Δ1–23, Alu Δ60–147) or TA cloning vector PCRTM 2.1 (Invitrogen) (Alu Δ68–141). Alu Δ1–23 and Alu Δ60–147 RNAs were transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase from the plasmid DNA template linearized by DraI. Alu Δ68–141+10 RNA was transcribed from the plasmid DNA template digested byEcoRI. Alu Δ151–159, Alu Δ68–141, and Alu Δ60–147+9 RNAs were transcribed from DNA prepared by PCR. All the Alu mutants with 3′ end variations were constructed by PCR-mediated mutagenesis, and the RNAs were transcribed directly from the PCR DNA product.Alu159 construct was cloned into pUC19 vector, andAlu159 RNA was made by T7 RNA polymerase transcription of DNA plasmid linearized by DraI. The in vitrotranscription with T7 RNA polymerase was performed according to standard protocol (New England Biolabs). All RNA products were purified by fractionation on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, extracted from the gel, and purified by precipitation with ethanol. The concentration of the RNAs was determined by optical density measurements at 260 nm. Extracts were prepared from HeLa cells grown in suspension culture by the procedure of Dignam et al. (35Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar). The final protein concentration of the extract was 5 mg/ml. Forin vitro labeling of RNAs, 5 μl of 10× in vitro labeling buffer (6 mm each GTP, UTP, and CTP, 250 μm ATP, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 200 mm KCl, 60 mm creatine phosphate, and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), 40 μl of nuclear extract, and 50 μCi of [α-32P]ATP were mixed in a total reaction volume of 50 μl and incubated at 30 °C for 3 h. The amount ofin vitro synthesized Alu RNA used as substrate for adenylation assay was ∼1 μg (20 pmol). In the case of other RNAs, correspondingly more or less amount of in vitro synthesized RNAs were added for adenylation assay to keep the amount of substrate RNAs at 20 pmol in each reaction. Labeled RNAs were extracted using phenol-chloroform procedure, purified, and fractionated on 10% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gels. Whenever necessary, the labeled RNAs were excised from the gel, eluted, and purified. These RNAs were then digested with different enzymes and analyzed by chromatography and/or size fractionation on 20% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea. The micrococcal nuclease treatment was done essentially as described by Parker and Steitz (36Parker K.A. Steitz J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 454-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). HeLa cell nuclear extract was incubated with micrococcal nuclease at a concentration of 1 unit/μl in the presence of 0.75 mmCaCl2 at 30 °C for 30 min. Micrococcal nuclease was inactivated by the addition of 2.5 mm EGTA, and the extract was then used for adenylation reactions. Immunoprecipitations were carried out as described by Steitz (37Steitz J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 468-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Alu RNA was incubated with 15 μl of HeLa cell nuclear extract in the presence of [α-32P]ATP in a total volume of 50 μl. One microliter of the labeled extract was immunoprecipitated with different amounts (20 and 50 μl) of anti-SRP 9-kDa protein antibodies (kindly provided by Dr. Maraia, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) or anti-bovine serum albumin antibodies as negative control. RNAs from the starting material, supernatant, and immunoprecipitate were purified and separated on 10% polyacrylamide gel. Approximately 10 fmol of the internally labeled Alu161, Alu161+7, andAlu161+11 RNAs were incubated with 20 μl of HeLa cell nuclear extract in a total volume of 50 μl for different time periods. RNAs were purified and fractionated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. The labeled RNAs were visualized by autoradiography. Internally labeled RNAs containing about 10,000 cpm (100 fmol in 20–60 nl) were injected into the vegetal half of the oocytes. Approximately same amount of radioactivity from each of the in vitro synthesized RNAs were mixed so as to obtain similar signal intensities on film during autoradiography. RNAs were isolated using the procedure described by Fischer et al. (38Fisher U. Darxynkiewicz E. Tahara S. Dathan N.A. Luhrmann R. Mattaj I.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 705-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). After various periods of incubation, the oocytes were suspended in homomedium (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmEDTA, 1.5% SDS, 300 mm NaCl), and proteinase K was added to a concentration of 1.5 mg/ml, mixed, and incubated for 15 min. at 37 °C. Labeled RNAs were extracted using phenol-chloroform procedure and purified by precipitation with ethanol. The purified RNAs were fractionated on 10% polyacrylamide gel/7 m urea gels, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. An oligonucleotide (5′-pGATCTGATAGTGTCACCTAAATGAATTCA*-3′) with 3′-cordycepin (A*) was ligated to RNAs purified from the HeLa cells or HeLa cell nucleoli. The nucleoli were prepared as described by Rothblumet al. (39Rothblum L.I. Mamrack P.M. Kunkle H.M. Olson M.O. Busch H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4716-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A BglII restriction site would be created if the 3′ end nucleotide of the RNA is an adenylic acid. A human SRP RNA-specific oligonucleotide (SRP RNA220, 5′-ACTCCCGTGCTGATCAGTAG-3′) was used for PCR amplification. Internally labeled PCR products were subjected to BglII digestion and fractionated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. We showed previously that SRP RNA present in the HeLa cell extract gets adenylated when incubated in the presence of [α-32P]ATP (Ref. 10Sinha K.M. Gu J. Chen Y. Reddy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6853-6859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar; also see Fig. 1,lane 1). In this study, we standardized anin vitro adenylation system that is dependent on the addition of exogenous SRP RNA or Alu RNA. First, the HeLa cell extract was treated with micrococcal nuclease and the nuclease was inactivated by the addition of EGTA. This HeLa cell extract digested with micrococcal nuclease was unable to adenylate any endogenous RNAs since the substrate RNAs were degraded by the nuclease (Fig. 1,lane 2). There is some residual tRNA resistant to micrococcal nuclease treatment. This may be due to secondary structure of tRNAs and/or association with protein(s). Addition of SRP RNA resulted in labeling of exogenously added SRP RNA (Fig. 1,lane 3). The 161-nucleotide-long Alu portion of SRP RNA (designated Alu RNA) also served as a substrate for adenylation (Fig. 1, lane 4). We also tested other RNAs as substrates for adenylation in this system. Human U6 snRNA or human U4 snRNA were not adenylated under these conditions. (Fig. 1,lanes 5 and 6, respectively). These data show that SRP and Alu RNAs synthesized in vitro serve as substrates for adenylation. In addition, the adenylation is not random since U4 or U6 snRNAs were not adenylated under the same conditions. Since micrococcal nuclease-treated HeLa cell extract is capable of adenylating exogenously added SRP RNA, the adenylating enzyme(s) do not appear to contain any essential nucleic acid component. Digestion of adenylated SRP RNA or Alu RNAs with T1 RNase yielded a single 6-nucleotide-long labeled UCUCUAOH fragment (Fig.1 B). Digestion with T2 RNase resulted in labeled Up both in Alu RNA (Fig. 1 C) and SRP RNA (data not shown). If more than one adenylic acid was added to the 3′ end of these RNAs, one would expect to see radioactivity in both Up and Ap. Therefore, these data show that a single adenylic acid residue is added to the 3′ end of exogenously added SRP and Alu RNAs. This pattern of single adenylic acid residue addition is identical to the adenylation of endogenous SRP RNA in HeLa cell extracts and adenylation of SRP RNA that occursin vivo (10Sinha K.M. Gu J. Chen Y. Reddy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6853-6859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These data also show that RNAs synthesizedin vitro by T7 RNA polymerase are accurately adenylated in this in vitro adenylation system. The Alu RNA synthesized in vitro and used as substrate for adenylation was 161 nucleotides long with UCUCUUUOH on its 3′ end. We expected this RNA to yield UCUCUUUAOH after adenylation reaction and subsequent digestion with T1 RNase. Instead, it was surprising that Alu RNA yielded UCUCUAOH after adenylation and digestion with T1 RNase (Fig.1 B). These data showed that from the Alu161 RNA two uridylic acid residues, corresponding to positions 160 and 161, were removed prior to adenylation on the uridylic acid 159 of Alu RNA. Similarly, SRP RNA added to the adenylation reaction contained three uridylic acid residues on its 3′ end, and two of these uridylic acid residues were removed before the addition of adenylic acid on the 3′ end of SRP RNA. To investigate this 3′ end processing further, Alu RNAs with longer 3′ end sequences were prepared and incubated with HeLa cell nuclear extract in the presence of [α-32P]ATP. Since Alu RNA migrates differently from the endogenous SRP RNA, the HeLa cell extract used in this experiment was not treated with micrococcal nuclease. Three RNAs were used as substrates in this assay including Alu RNA with UCUCUUUOH on its 3′ end and two other RNAs with 7 (designated Alu+7 RNA) or 11 additional nucleotides (designated Alu+11 RNA) on the 3′ end of Alu RNA. As expected, these three RNAs migrated differently on a 10% polyacrylamide gel (Fig.2 A, lanes 1–3). However, when these three RNAs were incubated with the HeLa cell extract, only labeled RNAs with similar electrophoretic mobility were obtained (Fig. 2 B). T1 RNase digestion of these RNAs yielded only one labeled fragment corresponding to UCUCUAOH (Fig. 2 C). After 3 h of incubation with HeLa cell nuclear extract, significant quantities of Alu+7 and Alu+11 RNAs were still detectable by staining with methylene blue at the end of adenylation reaction (data not shown). There was no consistent difference in the efficiency of adenylation between Alu+7 and Alu+11 RNAs. Since longer adenylated products were not detected (see Fig. 2, B and C), it appears that only Alu RNA molecules that are completely processed on the 3′ end are used as substrates for adenylation. The kinetics of the 3′ end processing was studied using Alu+11 RNA which was internally labeled (Fig. 2 D). The processingin vitro was rapid, with 50% of the RNA processed within 5 min and was nearly complete in 1 h. These data indicate that Alu RNA and Alu RNA with longer 3′ ends are first processed and then adenylated in the in vitro system. In addition, it appears that 3′ end processing is rapid in the in vitro system. Since 161-nucleotide-long Alu portion of SRP RNA was processed and adenylated, this RNA was used to carry out deletion experiments to determine the domains essential for processing and adenylation. Fig. 3 (A andB) shows the schematic representation of SRP RNA,Alu161 RNA, and some of the mutant Alu RNAs tested in this adenylation system. As expected, treatment of the HeLa cell nuclear extract with micrococcal nuclease degraded endogenous SRP and other RNA substrates and these RNAs were not labeled in the presence of [α-32P]ATP (Fig. 3 C, lane 2). Addition of Alu161 RNA resulted in adenylated RNA (Fig. 3 C, lane 3); however, in the case of Alu RNA with a 5′-deletion (lane 4) or a 3′-deletion (lane 5), there was no detectable adenylated product. An 87-nucleotide-long Alu RNA (AluΔ68–141), where nucleotides 68–141 were removed, was adenylated (Fig.3 C, lane 6). Further deletion, resulting in a 73-nucleotide-long RNA (AluΔ60–147) where integrity of stem IV was disrupted, resulted in complete absence of adenylation (Fig. 3 C, lane 7). These data show that a large central portion of Alu RNA is dispensable and both the 5′ and 3′ end sequences are necessary for adenylation. In addition, integrity of stem IV is also essential for adenylation. It is notable that 87-nucleotide-long Alu RNA with intact stem IV binds SRP 9/14-kDa protein heterodimer, whereas 73-nucleotide-long RNA with deletion of stem IV does not bind SRP 9/14-kDa protein heterodimer (30Weichenrieder O. Kapp U. Cusack S. Strub K. RNA. 1997; 3: 1262-1274PubMed Google Scholar). These data show that structural features necessary for the binding of SRP 9/14-kDa protein heterodimer are also important for adenylation of Alu RNA. As shown earlier, Alu161 RNA was first processed by removal of two uridylic acid residues and then adenylated (see Fig. 2). We tested whether 87-nucleotide-long RNA that gets adenylated and 73-nucleotide-long RNA that does not get adenylated can be processed or not. The AluΔ68–141 and AluΔ60–147 RNAs with 10 and 9 additional nucleotides, respectively (designated AluΔ68–141+10 RNA and AluΔ60–147+9 RNA), were injected into frog oocytes, and the 3′ end processing was studied (Fig. 4). The AluΔ68–141+10 RNA was processed in a time-dependent manner to yield an RNA that migrates similar to 87-nucleotide-long RNA (Fig. 4, lanes 1–4). The AluΔ60–147+9 RNA was not processed since there was no detectable 73-nucleotide-long RNA even 18 h after injection (Fig. 4, lanes 1–4). Similar results were obtained when the experiment was performed using HeLa cell nuclear extract (data not shown). Since the only difference between these two constructs is the presence of stem IV in AluΔ68–141 RNA and absence of intact stem IV in AluΔ60–147 RNA, it is concluded that stem IV of Alu RNA is required both for 3′ end processing and adenylation. It is interesting to note that the minimal domain of Alu RNA required for 3′ end processing and adenylation is very similar, if not identical, to that required for SRP 9/14 protein heterodimer binding (30Weichenrieder O. Kapp U. Cusack S. Strub K. RNA. 1997; 3: 1262-1274PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of stem IV, which is important for binding of SRP 9/14 protein heterodimer (33Sarrowa J. Chang D.-Y. Maraia R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1144-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), completely abolished processing and adenylation. Therefore, we tested whether adenylated SRP and Alu RNAs are associated with SRP 9/14 protein heterodimer or not. After adenylation of SRP and Alu RNAs in vitro in the presence of [α-32P]ATP, immunoprecipitations were carried out with anti-SRP 9 antibodies. Both endogenous SRP RNA and exogenously added Alu RNA were adenylated and were found in the immunoprecipitates obtained with anti-SRP9 protein antibodies. Approximately 20% of the adenylated SRP and Alu RNAs were immunoprecipitated when 20 μl of the anti-SRP9 antibodies was used (Fig. 5,lanes 1 and 2), and this percentage increased to about 50% when the amount of antibody was increased to 50 μl (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 4). Under conditions of antibody excess, virtually all the adenylated SRP and Alu RNAs were found in the immunoprecipitates obtained with anti-SRP9 protein antibodies (data not shown). Uniformly labeled AluΔ60–147 RNA, which cannot bind SRP9/14 heterodimer, was also used as a control, and no detectable radioactivity was found in immunoprecipitates obtained with anti-SRP9 antibodies (data not shown). These data show that adenylated SRP and Alu RNAs are associated with SRP 9/14 heterodimer. Since the 3′ end sequence where the adenylation is occurring was found to be important, several mutant RNAs were made and tested in the in vitro adenylation system. A schematic representation of mutant Alu RNAs is shown in Fig. 6 A. We already showed that deletion of 9 nucleotides near the 3′ end (AluΔ151–159) completely abolished adenylation (Fig. 3 C,lane 5). RNAs terminating with A or C instead of U at position 160 (Fig. 6 B, lanes 4,5, and 6, respectively), were recognized as substrates for adenylation, and in every case RNAs adenylated at position 160 were observed. Disruption of base pairing in stem III of Alu RNA, where one G:C base pair was disrupted (Fig. 6 B,lane 7) or changed from G:C to G:U (Fig.6 B, lane 3), did not inhibit the adenylation; however, further disruption of base pairing in stem III (Fig.6 B, lanes 9 and 10), abolished adenylation completely. In RNAs where adenylation was observed, the 3′ end fragment obtained upon T1 RNase digestion was UCUCUAOH (Fig. 6 C, lanes 1–6). As to be expected, in the case of Alu158C → G RNA, the T1 RNase digestion product was UAOH (Fig.6 C, lane 7). The adenylated mutant Alu RNAs (Fig. 6 B, lanes 3–8) were also digested with T2 RNase, and, in every case, only labeled Up was observed (data not shown). These data show that all longer RNAs were first processed and the adenylation occurred accurately at uridylic acid 159 of mutant Alu RNAs. In mammalian cells, SRP RNA is synthesized in the nucleoplasm by RNA polymerase III and is first seen in the nucleolus before migrating to the cytoplasm (32Jacobson M.R. Pederson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7981-7986Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We tested whether SRP RNA found in the nucleolus is adenylated or not. Total RNA was isolated from HeLa cells and also from nucleoli purified from HeLa cells. An oligonucleotide was ligated to these RNAs, and after a quantitative RT-PCR, which selectively amplifies the 3′ end portion of SRP RNA, the resulting DNA was analyzed before and after digestion withBglII restriction enzyme. The oligonucleotide ligated to the SRP RNA was designed in such a way that only SRP RNA containing adenylic acid on the 3′ end will be digested with BglII. Data presented in Fig. 7 show that approximately 35% of the nucleolar SRP RNA contained adenylic acid on the 3′ end (Fig. 7, lane 2) and 50% of the SRP RNA in HeLa cells contained adenylic acid on the 3′ end (Fig. 7,lane 4). These data show that the 3′ end processing and adenylation of SRP RNA occurs in the nucleus, before SRP RNA enters the cytoplasm. The main observation made during this investigation is that an 87-nucleotide-long region, corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ regions out of the 300-nucleotide-long mammalian SRP RNA, is necessary and sufficient for accurate 3′ end processing and adenylation. Studies from other laboratories have shown that this domain of SRP RNA has a tRNA-like structure and binds to two (9/14-kDa) SRP proteins (30Weichenrieder O. Kapp U. Cusack S. Strub K. RNA. 1997; 3: 1262-1274PubMed Google Scholar). This domain was also recently shown to be necessary and sufficient for transport of SRP RNA from nucleoplasm to the nucleolus and then to the cytoplasm (32Jacobson M.R. Pederson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7981-7986Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These data show that this domain of SRP RNA, in addition to arresting translation of proteins containing the signal peptide, which are destined for translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum, has multiple functions. These functions include binding of 9/14-kDa SRP proteins, 3′ end processing where extra sequences on the 3′ end are removed, adenylation where a single adenylic acid residue is added, and migration of SRP RNA from nucleoplasm, where SRP RNA is synthesized, to nucleolus and then to the cytoplasm. SRP RNA is synthesized by RNA polymerase III and terminates with four uridylic acid residues on its 3′ end. However, SRP RNA characterized from several mammalian sources including human, rat,Drosophila, and frog show that several of these uridylic acid residues on the 3′ end are not present in most of the mature cytoplasmic SRP RNA molecules. In addition, a single post-transcriptionally added adenylic acid residue is found in over 50% of the human and rat SRP RNA population (10Sinha K.M. Gu J. Chen Y. Reddy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6853-6859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Data presented in this paper describe an accurate in vitro system that removes the terminal uridylic acid residues from exogenously added SRP/Alu RNAs and adds one adenylic acid residue. It is interesting to note that Alu RNAs with longer 3′ ends containing 7 or 11 extra nucleotides were accurately processed and then adenylated. We also used Alu RNAs with ∼200 extra nucleotides on the 3′ end, and this RNA was also accurately processed and adenylated, though less efficiently (data not shown). These data indicate that human cells have the ability to accurately process and adenylate longer read-through SRP RNA transcripts that failed to terminate at the first pol III termination site. It is relevant to note that, in the case of human 5 S RNA genes, read-through transcription in vivo through the first pol III termination site is well documented (40Bogenhagen D.F. Brown D.D. Cell. 1981; 24: 261-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). While there is no evidence that longer read-through SRP RNA transcripts are actually made in vivo, it is known that Alu RNAs are made as longer transcripts and processed to yield mature Alu RNAs. Only the Alu RNA sequences capable of binding SRP 9/14-kDa protein heterodimer were found to be processed accurately and accumulated in the cytoplasm (33Sarrowa J. Chang D.-Y. Maraia R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1144-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These data are consistent and support the results obtained during this investigation. Although 300-nucleotide-long SRP RNA, 161-nucleotide-long Alu RNA, and also the 87-nucleotide-long deletion mutant (AluΔ68–141) were all processed and adenylated, the efficiencies of adenylation were dramatically different. The SRP RNA was the least efficient and AluΔ68–141 was the most efficient. The adenylation efficiency of Alu RNA was consistently better than SRP RNA (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 4; Fig. 3 C, lanes 3 and 6). The reason for this might be that smaller RNAs may renature and acquire native conformation much more readily compared with longer RNAs. Fig. 8 shows a proposed pathway for the biogenesis of SRP RNA. The SRP RNA is made in the nucleoplasm with four uridylic acid residues on the 3′ end. This RNA binds to SRP9/14-kDa protein heterodimer, followed by removal of three uridylic acid residues and adenylation. Since SRP RNA in the nucleolus is already adenylated, it is clear that this processing and adenylation is occurring in the nucleus. Whether it happens in the nucleoplasm or in the nucleolus is not known. Purification of nucleoplasmic SRP RNA without nucleolar and/or cytoplasmic SRP RNA contamination is necessary to answer this question. It is very likely that the processing and adenylation pathway shown in Fig. 8 is common to SRP RNA and to Alu RNAs. The fact that SRP RNA in the nucleolus is already adenylated shows that 3′ end processing and adenylation is an early and nuclear event in the biogenesis of SRP particle. However, Alu RNAs injected into frog oocyte cytoplasm were accurately processed indicating that machinery for 3′ end processing of SRP RNA can occur both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. It is known that the 3′ ends of some RNAs, like human U6 snRNA, are constantly trimmed and rebuilt (41Gu J. Shumyatsky G. Makan N. Reddy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21989-21993Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The adenylic acid residue added on the 3′ end of SRP RNA also appears to be turning over constantly. For example, Alu160A RNA, which has an adenylic acid on the 3′ end, was labeled in the in vitro adenylation system by removal of unlabeled adenylic acid residue and replacement with a labeled adenylic acid (Fig. 5 B, lane 4). Therefore, it is possible that SRP RNA adenylated in the nucleus is also adenylated in the cytoplasm during turnover. This process is reminiscent of CCA turnover on the 3′ end of tRNAs where terminal nucleotides are constantly turning over. Although the necessity of CCA turnover in tRNAs can be rationalized on the basis of the need for complete CCA sequence for aminoacylation, the need for A turnover in SRP is not known. We investigated whether SRP/Alu RNA itself is the substrate or whether binding of 9/14-kDa protein is required for Alu/SRP to be recognized as a substrate for 3′ end processing and adenylation. It is known that in the case of U1, U2, and U4 snRNAs, precursor RNAs first associate with snRNP proteins to form snRNPs and then get processed (1Madore S.J. Wieben E.D. Kunkel G.R. Pederson T. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1140-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 3Wieben E.D. Nenninger J.M. Pederson T. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 183: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 5Zieve G.W. Sauterer R.A. Feeney R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 199: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It is clear from the immunoprecipitation data shown in Fig. 4 that adenylated SRP and Alu RNAs are bound to the 9/14-kDa proteins. The Alu RNA substrate added to the adenylation reaction is in large excess compared with the 9/14-kDa protein available in the HeLa cell extract (1 μg of substrate RNA for 60 μg of total protein in the nuclear extract). Therefore, if RNA alone is a suitable substrate for processing and adenylation, only a small fraction of the adenylated RNA would be immunoprecipitable. The fact that virtually all the adenylated Alu RNA was precipitable under conditions of excess antibody strongly suggests that 9/14-kDa protein binding is required for processing and adenylation. This conclusion is consistent with the observation that Alu RNA mutant AluΔ60–147, which cannot bind 9/14-kDa protein heterodimer, was neither processed nor adenylated (Fig. 3 D). Only Alu RNAs capable of binding SRP 9/14-kDa protein heterodimer accumulate in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells (33Sarrowa J. Chang D.-Y. Maraia R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1144-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Together, these data show that SRP RNA first binds to the 9/14-kDa heterodimer, three uridylic acid residues are removed, and then a single adenylic acid residue is added in the nucleus. Adenylation in the 3′ end is not unique to SRP RNA. Adenylation occurs on the 3′ end of many RNAs including human U2 snRNA, 7 SK RNA, and ribosomal 5 S RNA (10Sinha K.M. Gu J. Chen Y. Reddy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6853-6859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The 3′ end processing of U1, U2, and U4 snRNAs has been extensively characterized both in vitro andin vivo using the frog oocyte system and transfection into cells (1Madore S.J. Wieben E.D.

In the case of U2 snRNA, processing and adenylation appear to be a late event where precursor RNA is first transported to the cytoplasm for 3′ end processing (5Zieve G.W. Sauterer R.A. Feeney R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 199: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Whether the adenylation of U2 snRNA occurs in the cytoplasm or the nucleus after import is not known. In our in vitro adenylation system, the U2 snRNA and 7 SK RNA were not good substrates for adenylation (data not shown). It is possible that some essential binding proteins were missing in the HeLa nuclear extract used for the adenylation reactions. It is not known whether all these small RNAs are adenylated by a common adenylation machinery or different enzymes are responsible for the adenylation of other RNAs. Purification and characterization of the SRP RNA adenylating enzyme will help answer this question.

https://openalex.org/W1968365374,"The c-rel proto-oncogene product, c-Rel, belongs to the Rel/NF-κB transcription factor family, which regulates a large variety of cellular functions. The activation of NF-κB involves the degradation of the inhibitor, IκB, through the ubiquitin-proteasome (Ub-Pr)-mediated pathway. Here we report that the turnover of c-Rel is also regulated by the Ub-Pr pathway, thus adding another level of complexity to the regulation of NF-κB. High molecular weight ubiquitinated c-Rel conjugates are detected in cells and accumulate in cells treated with proteasome inhibitors. In a cell-free in vitro degradation assay, c-Rel is degraded specifically through the Ub-Pr pathway. N-terminally truncated c-Rel is readily degraded, implying the dispensability of N-terminal sequence; in contrast, a series of deletion mutants missing C-terminal sequences display a reduced susceptibility to the degradation. Interestingly, the sequence between residues 118 and 171 of c-Rel, i.e. the region immediately following the c-Rel/v-Rel homology domain, appears to play an important role in mediating ubiquitin conjugation and the subsequent degradation. Together with our previous study showing an elevated tumorigenic potential for C-terminally truncated mutants, our data suggest that the C-terminal domain of c-Rel plays an important role in mediating c-Rel degradation and growth control.

NF-κB is highly regulated and is activated by a large variety of stimuli, such as cytokines, growth factors, oxidants, UV irradiation, infections, and physical or oxidative stress. NF-κB plays a pivotal role in the regulation of many genes involving immune and inflammatory responses, healing and regeneration processes, and embryogenesis. This family of proteins share sequence homology in the N-terminal Rel homology region, which is responsible for DNA binding, dimerization, and inhibitor association. c-Rel is expressed at high levels in hematopoietic cells and regulates the expression of different genes in B and T cells that are crucial for cell division, apoptosis, and immune functions. Although c-rel knockout mice develop normally, they exhibit defects in lymphocyte proliferation, humoral immunity, and interleukin-2 expression (7Kontgen F. Grumont R.J. Strasser A. Metcalf D. Li R. Tarlinton D. Gerondakis S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1965-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). In most cells, Rel/NF-κB proteins serve an antiapoptosis function, and overexpression of c-Rel results in cellular transformation (reviewed in Ref. 8Sonenshein G.E. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). However, in developing chicken embryos and in chicken bone marrow cells, high levels of c-Rel expression are associated with programmed cell death (9Abbadie C. Kabrun N. Bouali F. Smardova J. Stehelin D. Vandenbunder B. Enrietto P.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 899-912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Despite these seemingly contradictory reports, regulation of c-Rel expression undoubtedly plays an important role in maintaining normal growth and development. Alterations or amplification of the rel locus have been found in human lymphomas (reviewed in Ref. 10Luque I. Gelinas C. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and viral transduction of c-rel resulted in v-rel, the transforming gene of the reticuloendotheliosis virus, strain T (REV-T) (4Gilmore T.D. Goodbourn S. Frontiers in Molecular Biology: Eukaryotic Transcription. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 104-133Google Scholar, 11Bose Jr., H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1114: 1-17PubMed Google Scholar). REV-T is a highly virulent retrovirus that induces a fatal lymphoid leukemia in galliform birds within 7–10 days after infection. The v-Rel protein differs structurally from c-Rel in that v-Rel lacks the N-terminal two amino acids and the C-terminal 118 amino acids that are normally present in c-Rel. Instead, v-Rel has viral envsequences at both termini and contains multiple amino acid substitutions and small in-frame deletions in the middle (11Bose Jr., H.R. Biochim. Biophys.

Recently, transgenic mice overexpressing v-Rel were shown to develop aggressive T-cell lymphoma/leukemia, further demonstrating the oncogenic potential of v-Rel in mammals (13Carrasco D. Risso C.A.

The pathway, present in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, consists of two distinct and sequential steps. The target protein is first conjugated with multiple ubiquitin molecules and then translocated to and degraded by the large 26 S proteasome (reviewed in Ref. 20Pickart C.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1055-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The list of Ub-Pr pathway substrates has been growing rapidly. Prominent examples include proto-oncogene products, transcription factors, cell cycle regulators, cytokine and growth factor receptors, major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, and others. Activation of NF-κB also involves the Ub-Pr degradation pathway. In the absence of inducers, the NF-κB dimeric transcription factor is sequestered in the cytoplasm through physical association with a member of the IκB family of inhibitor proteins. In response to extracellular stimuli, IκBα (the best studied inhibitor) is phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and degraded by the proteasome, thus releasing the NF-κB dimer for translocation into the nucleus.

Chem. 1994; 269: 30089-30092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For Fig. 2 b, Jurkat cells were lysed with Nonidet P-40 buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors (1% aprotinin, 50 μmLLnL, 70 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 40 μg/ml TPCK, 5 μg/ml TLCK, 5 μg/ml leupeptin) and 10 mm iodoacetamide. The Nonidet P-40-soluble and -insoluble fractions were further analyzed by immunoprecipitations and Western blot. For Western analysis, equal amounts of protein (assayed with the BCA kit; Pierce) or fractions isolated from equal number cells were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto polyvinylpyrrolidone membranes. The membrane was blocked, washed, incubated with antiserum (typically at 1:1000) followed by reacting with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin serum (Boehringer Mannheim), and developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immunoprecipitation analysis, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (20 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100) or in other specified buffers containing protease inhibitors and 10 mm iodoacetamide. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × gfor 30 min and then incubated with individual antiserum in the presence or absence of the competing peptide (2 μg for each μl of antiserum). The immune complexes were collected with Protein A-Sepharose beads, washed with radioimmune precipitation buffer, boiled, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto membranes, and further analyzed.Figure 2Identification of ubiquitinated c-Rel proteins and detection of ubiquitinated c-Rel in Nonidet P-40-insoluble fractions in proteasome inhibitor-treated cells. a, human Jurkat T cells were cultured in growth medium with 0.5% serum for 16 h and then stimulated with 15% serum in the presence of LC for 0, 0.5, and 2 h. Cells were lysed, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-(c-Rel 1135) serum. The immune complexes were separated into two aliquots, and each was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Western transfer, and immunoblotting (IB) with either anti-c-Rel 1135 (lanes 1–3) or anti-Ub (lanes 4–6) serum. The full-length c-Rel and the ubiquitinated c-Rel (Ub n -c-Rel) are indicated. The heavy bands at thebottom of the gel represent Ig reactivities. b, Jurkat cells were treated with proteasome inhibitor, LLnL, for up to 20 h. The cells were lysed, and the lysates were separated to Nonidet P-40-soluble and -insoluble fractions. The cleared Nonidet P-40-soluble lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Rel serum (Upstate Biotechnology) (lanes 1–5), separated on SDS-gel with the Nonidet P-40-insoluble fractions (lanes 6–10), and Western blotted with c-Rel antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The human c-Rel expression plasmid pRC/CMV-h-rel, kindly provided by N. Rice (NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center), was used in both in vivoand in vitro expressions. All of the expression plasmids containing C-terminally truncated avian c-rel were constructed using pc-rel2 (31Nehyba J. Hrdlickova R. Humphries E.H. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2039-2050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as the template. Synthetic oligonucleotide adapters (Table I, column 5) containing stop codons (underlined) were inserted between specific restriction sites inc-rel coding sequence (columns 3 and 4) and theBssHII site of pc-rel2, thus replacing a portion ofc-rel coding sequence. For pc-relΔ118, stop codon was introduced by oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis, in which the mutagenic oligonucleotide (5′-CGTGAACATGTAGACCAATGAC-3′) and the MutaGene in vitro mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad) were used. Sequences around the insertion sites and sequences subjected to site-directed mutagenesis were verified by sequencing. Plasmids designated pc-relΔX (X indicates the number of deleted amino acids) were used in the in vitro transcription and translation for further analyses.Table IConstruction of expression vectors for synthesis of C-terminally truncated variants of c-RelProteinaProteins synthesized from pc-rel2 and pc-relΔX expression vectors.

Open table in a new tab The previously published anti-(c-Rel 1135) and anti-(c-Rel 265) sera were generated against peptides corresponding to residues 493–509 and 573–587 of human c-Rel, respectively (32Li C.-C.H. Korner M. Ferris D.K. Chen E. Dai R.-M. Longo D.L. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Other human c-Rel antisera, purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (catalog no. sc-70) and Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (catalog no. 06–421), were raised against peptides corresponding to murine c-Rel residues 152–176 and human c-Rel residues 573–587, respectively. Anti-ubiquitin immune sera were purchased from Sigma and Dako, Inc. Avian c-Rel antisera V1, V2, and V3 (33Hrdlickova R. Nehyba J. Bose Jr., H.R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3369-3380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were generated against residues 115–292, 293–458, and 425–437 of avian c-Rel, respectively. Human c-Rel, avian c-Rel, and C-terminally truncated c-RelΔX proteins were synthesized with [35S]methionine in a reticulocyte lysate-based in vitro transcription/translation system (Promega). The35S-labeled proteins were purified away from the free [35S]methionine by concentrating in Centricon 30 (Amicon) and used as the substrates in the in vitro degradation and conjugation assays (24Li C.-C.H. Dai R.-M. Longo D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 292-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 34Dai R.M. Chen E. Longo D.L. Gorbea C.M. Li C.-C.H. J. Biol.

For degradation assays, master reaction mixture containing substrate (1 μl/time point), dialyzed Ub (6 μg/time point), 12 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 60 mm KCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm ATP was prepared and aliquoted into separate tubes on ice. At each time point, 50 μg of S100 was added to individual tubes to start the reaction at 37 °C, and the final volume of each reaction was adjusted to 50 μl. All of the reactions were simultaneously terminated by boiling in SDS-sample buffer, analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western transfer and autoradiography. For conjugation assays, reactions were carried out as in degradation assays except that okadaic acid (1 μg/ml), proteasome inhibitor LLnL (100 μm), and isopeptidase inhibitor iodoacetamide (10 mm) were included (34Dai R.M.

Transient transfection was carried out using the SuperFect Transfection kit (Qiagen) according to the instructions. The coding sequence of chicken c-rel (35Capobianco A.J. Simmons D.L. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 257-265PubMed Google Scholar) was cloned as aXhoI-BssHII fragment from pc-rel2 betweenXhoI and MluI sites of mammalian expression vector pCI-neo (Promega). An aliquot of 5 μg of DNA was used to transfect 4 × 105 NIH3T3 or COS cells seeded in each 60-mm dish. After transfection for 2.5 h, cells were washed and grown in fresh medium for 40 h. Cells were then either treated with inhibitors or used for the pulse-chase experiments. We and others previously showed that NF-κB is constitutively activated and c-Rel is highly induced in both HTLV-I-infected T cells and B-lymphoma cells (28Li C.-C.H. Ruscetti F.W. Rice N.R. Chen E. Yang N. Mikovits J. Longo D.L. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4205-4213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Lanoix J. Lacoste J. Pepin N. Rice N. Hiscott J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 841-852PubMed Google Scholar, 37Arima N. Molitor J.A. Smith M.R. Kim J.H. Daitoku Y. Greene W.C. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6892-6899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblotting analyses showed that, in addition to the 80-kDa full-length c-Rel, high M r proteins were detected in both the cytoplasmic and the nuclear lysates of HTLV-I-infected cells (Fig.1 a). These highM r proteins were reactive to a number of c-Rel antisera (one such experiment is shown in Fig. 1 a,lanes 1–6) but not to the corresponding preimmune sera (data not shown) or the immune sera preincubated with the competing peptides (lanes 7 and8). To further characterize these c-Rel proteins, cell lysates from a B cell lymphoma cell line were immunoprecipitated with c-Rel-specific antiserum in the absence (Fig. 1 b,lane 1) or presence (lane 2) of the competing peptide, and the immune complexes were separated and analyzed by immunoblotting with c-Rel antiserum. Reactivities in a ladder-like pattern, indicative of multiubiquitin conjugates, were detected only in the former (lane 1), suggesting that c-Rel may be subject to ubiquitin modification. To confirm that the high M ranti-c-Rel-reactive proteins were indeed the ubiquitinated c-Rel, serum-starved Jurkat cells were stimulated with serum, which induced the expression of c-Rel, in the presence of a proteasome-specific inhibitor, LC (Fig. 2 a) (17Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar). The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with c-Rel-specific antiserum, and the immune complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with either c-Rel antiserum (lanes 1–3) or Ub antiserum (lanes 4–6). As in Fig. 1 b, high M r c-Rel-specific reactivity in a ladder-like pattern was detected after inhibitor treatment for 2 h (lane 3). The similar highM r reactivity detected in anti-Ub immunoblotting (lane 6) further demonstrated that these highM r proteins are the bona fide ubiquitin-c-Rel conjugates. Similar results were also obtained using other proteasome inhibitors including MG132 and LLnL (also known as ALLN or Calpain inhibitor I) (data not shown). We also treated Jurkat cells with the inhibitor LLnL, and measured the steady state level of c-Rel in Jurkat cells (Fig. 2 b). Interestingly, while the high M r c-Rel proteins expectedly accumulated during the inhibitor treatment, these highM r c-Rel proteins were detected mainly in the detergent-insoluble fractions (lanes 6–10). This result suggests that c-Rel is constantly ubiquitinated and that the ubiquitinated c-Rel tends to accumulate in the noncytoplasmic fractions. To demonstrate that the normal turnover of c-Rel is regulated by the Ub-Pr pathway, we treated cells with LLnL to block the proteasome activity and measured the stability of c-Rel. In cells expressing high levels of NF-κB,e.g. B cells and certain T cells, c-Rel is often associated with other NF-κB or IκB family proteins, which may provide c-Rel physical protections against proteosomal degradation. To avoid this physical protection, we transiently overexpressed avian c-Rel in NIH3T3 cells, which have a low NF-κB endogenous expression, treated the cells with LLnL, and analyzed the total cell lysates. Similar to Fig.2, immunoblot using c-Rel-specific antiserum revealed that the 80-kDa c-Rel was stabilized and that the high M rUb-c-Rel conjugates accumulated in a time-dependent fashion (Fig. 3 a). Furthermore, we overexpressed avian c-Rel in monkey COS cells and performed pulse-chase experiments in the presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor, LLnL (Fig. 3 b). Cells collected from each time point were lysed by boiling in SDS-containing buffer, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with c-Rel antiserum. Although c-Rel is relatively stable with an estimated half-life of slightly longer than 9 h in untreated cells (lanes 2–7), the half-life of c-Rel in LLnL-treated cells is considerably longer than 9 h (lanes 8–13). It was noted that a decrease of c-Rel was detected at 20 h (lane 12) in treated cells, similar to that in the untreated cells (lane 6). However, this decrease was largely due to the cell death resulting from the long period of inhibitor treatment. More than 50% of the cells were dead after 20 h of LLnL treatment (data not shown). Importantly, the level of c-Rel in inhibitor-treated cells is significantly higher than that in the untreated cells at every time point (compare lanes 8–13 with lanes 2–7, respectively), indicating that LLnL is capable of stabilizing c-Rel and inhibiting the normal degradation of c-Rel. To further study the Ub-Pr regulation of c-Rel, a cell-free, in vitro Ub-Pr degradation assay was used (22Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1908) Google Scholar, 24Li C.-C.H. Dai R.-M. Longo D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 292-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this assay, human c-Rel was in vitro transcribed and translated in the presence of [35S]methionine and used as the substrate. The degradation can be demonstrated using c-Rel synthesized in either a reticulocyte lysate (Fig. 4,lanes 1–6) or a wheat germ (data not shown) translation system, or using endogenous c-Rel immunoprecipitated from cell lysates (data not shown). This in vitro degradation of c-Rel is Ub-Pr pathway-specific because c-Rel was not degraded in assays performed in the presence of proteasome inhibitors, lactacystin (lanes 7–9), LLnL (lanes 10–12), MG132 (data not shown), or apyrase (an ATP remover) (data not shown). By contrast, TPCK (lanes 13–15), TLCK (lanes 16–18), and weak bases (data not shown), inhibitors of chymotrypsin-like proteases, trypsin-like proteases, and lysosomes, respectively, did not inhibit the degradation. These results strongly suggest that the degradation of c-Rel is mediated by the proteasome pathway in the in vitrosystem. In addition to the full-length 80-kDa c-Rel, a smaller protein with an apparent molecular mass of 45 kDa (p45) was also readily degraded in the in vitro assay (Fig. 4,lanes 1–6; Fig. 5,lanes 1–4). Presumably, p45 is either a c-Rel proteolytic fragment generated from the translation product in the rabbit reticulocyte system, or a smaller c-Rel translation product resulted from an internal initiation. To characterize p45, we immunoprecipitated the in vitro reactions (Fig. 5,lanes 1–4) with antisera specific to either the N-terminal (lanes 5–8) or the C-terminal (lanes 9–12) sequence of c-Rel. The C-terminal specific antiserum precipitated both the full-length and p45 c-Rel, whereas the N-terminal specific antiserum only precipitated the full-length c-Rel, indicating that p45 lacks the N-terminal sequence. This result suggests that the N-terminal domain of c-Rel is not required in the in vitro degradation of c-Rel, and the C-terminal domain may play a more important role in mediating c-Rel degradation. Similar experiments were also performed in avian c-Rel, and the same conclusion was obtained (data not shown). To examine the importance of the C-terminal sequences, a series of C-terminally truncated avian c-rel expression plasmids were constructed (Table I and Fig.6 a), and used to translate the corresponding c-Rel proteins in vitro (Fig. 6 b). When these 35S-labeled c-Rel variants were tested in thein vitro degradation assays (Fig.7 a), interestingly, mutants with truncations larger than 118 amino acids displayed nearly complete resistance to degradation. PhosphorImager scanning (Molecular Dynamics, Inc. Sunnyvale, CA) revealed that about 80, 82, 100, and 100% of the input substrates remained at the end of the assay for mutants lacking the C-terminal 171, 231, 275, and 313 amino acids, respectively. In contrast, only 5, 10, and 25% of the input c-Rel remained for mutants missing the C-terminal 16, 55, and 118 amino acids, respectively (Fig.7 b). Since c-Rel and v-Rel share sequence similarities only at the N-terminal 118 amino acids, these results seem to suggest that the region between residues 118 and 171 of c-Rel, i.e. the c-Rel-specific sequence immediately following the c-Rel/v-Rel homology domain, plays an importan"

However, extensive characterization of these mammalian AMPD recombinant activities has been limited by their low yields in bacterial cells,i.e. ≤0.2 unit/mg of soluble protein. This report demonstrates that baculoviral expression and co-expression of wild type and N-truncated human AMPD1 and AMPD3 recombinant proteins produces much greater amounts of enzyme. Partial purification and characterization of these activities provides insight regarding the role of divergent N-terminal domains of AMPD isoforms on the physical, catalytic, and actomyosin binding properties of the enzyme.DISCUSSIONAMP deaminase (AMPD) is a highly regulated enzyme that has been purified and characterized from a variety of mammalian tissues and cells. However, subunit molecular masses predicted from cDNA sequences are uniformly larger than those observed in enzymes purified from endogenous sources. Using a baculoviral vector to express human cDNAs in insect cells, it is possible to isolate recombinant AMPD activities that contain apparent full-sized subunits. However, phosphocellulose purification of these activities is not adequate to prevent subsequent reductions in subunit molecular mass during storage at 4 °C. These results are reminiscent of those obtained with preparations of rabbit (17Ranieri-Raggi M. Raggi A. Biochem. J. 1980; 189: 367-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 18Chilson O.P.

Physiol. 1997; 116B: 371-377Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar) skeletal muscle AMPD stored at 4 °C following their purification in the presence of protease inhibitors. Data presented in the current study extend knowledge of proteolyzed AMPD enzymes through the identification of N-truncated polypeptides in both human AMPD1 (isoform M) andAMPD3 (isoform E) recombinant activities following their storage at 4 °C: AMPD1, ΔI86 and ΔH98;AMPD3, ΔL88 and ΔM90. Furthermore, genetically modified enzymes modeled after these N-truncated variants, ΔL96AMPD1 and ΔM90AMPD3, exhibit physical and catalytic properties similar to those reported for purified isoforms M (2Ogasawara N. Goto H. Yamada Y. Watanabe T. Asano T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 714: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 16Stankiewicz A. Int. J. Biochem. 1981; 13: 1177-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and E (2Ogasawara N. Goto H. Yamada Y. Watanabe T. Asano T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 714: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 30Yun S.-L. Suelter C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 404-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Nathans G.R. Chang D. Deuel T.F. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), respectively. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that available literature on purified isoforms M and E have been derived primarily from N-truncated enzymes.Isolation of AMPD recombinant activities initially comprising apparent full-sized subunits allows in vitro examinations of catalytic and physical properties of the entire enzyme. Unlike their N-truncated variants, wild type human AMPD1 andAMPD3 enzymes exhibit significantly greaterK m(app) values in the absence of ATP. This observation reveals a potential mechanism to help preserve adenylate pools during periods of net ATP catabolism. Moreover, wild typeAMPD1 recombinant protein exists as a large complex (>2000 kDa). Because the ΔL96AMPD1 enzyme has a native tetrameric structure, aggregation of the wild type enzyme comprising apparent full-sized subunits appears attributable to the N-terminal 95 amino acid residues of the polypeptide. This contention is confirmed by data showing that storage of the wild type protein at 4 °C results in the appearance of AMPD1 activity with native and subunit molecular masses similar to the ΔL96AMPD1 enzyme.AMPD enzymes comprising mixed subunits have been proposed based on the partial characterization of five resolved activities in extracts prepared from rat brain (28Ogasawara N. Goto H. Watanabe T. FEBS Lett. 1975; 58: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Three of these activities are precipitated from solution with both anti-isoform B (AMPD2) and anti-isoform C (AMPD3) sera. However, neither native structures nor subunit compositions of these presumed hybrid activities have been examined. Recombinant co-expression of human AMPD1and AMPD3 cDNAs provides a means for extending these previous observations. Combined chromatographic and Western blot analyses show greater relative abundance of AMPD1polypeptides in this expression system, and under these conditions allAMPD3 polypeptides are assembled into AMPD1/AMPD3heterotetrameric enzymes. These combined observations indicate that assembly of all tetrameric AMPD enzymes is driven by relative polypeptide abundance with no apparent preference for like subunits.AMPD1/AMPD3 heterotetrameric enzymes may impact clinical consequences of a prevalent nonsense mutation in the AMPD1gene, i.e. variable association of an exercise-induced skeletal myopathy (37Sabina R.L. Holmes E.W. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Genetic Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1985: 1769-1780Google Scholar) and increased survival in congestive heart failure (38Loh E. Rebbeck T.R. Mahoney P.D. Stolle C.A. Swain J.L. Holmes E.W. Circulation. 1996; : 941Google Scholar). Many individuals who are homozygous for this mutantAMPD1 allele do not exhibit skeletal myopathy, a clinical outcome that is proposed to be affected by an alternative splicing event that removes the mutation from 0.6–2% of AMPD1transcripts (20Morisaki H. Morisaki T. Newby L.K. Holmes E.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2275-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Therefore, these individuals produce small amounts of functional isoform M in their skeletal muscles despite a homozygous mutant genotype. Carriers of the AMPD1 nonsense mutation reportedly have increased survival in congestive heart failure (CHF) compared with those who are homozygous for the normal allele. Clinical divergence in CHF is presumably related to different rates of cardiac adenosine production in these two groups of individuals (38Loh E. Rebbeck T.R. Mahoney P.D. Stolle C.A. Swain J.L. Holmes E.W. Circulation. 1996; : 941Google Scholar).AMPD3 is expressed in type I skeletal muscle fibers (7Mahnke-Zizelman D.K. D'Cunha J. Wojnar J.M. Brogley M.A. Sabina R.L. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 39van Kuppevelt T.H. Veerkamp J.H. Fishbein W.N. Ogasawara N. Sabina R.L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and in the heart (7Mahnke-Zizelman D.K. D'Cunha J. Wojnar J.M. Brogley M.A. Sabina R.L. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), thus creating a potential for assembly of hybrid tetrameric enzymes in these two tissues. Production ofAMPD1/AMPD3 enzymes in type I skeletal muscle fibers of individuals with inherited AMPD1 deficiency and in CHF patients would serve to maximize AMPD1 expression and may influence clinical outcomes related to this genetic defect.Skeletal muscle AMPD (AMPD1) binds reversibly to contractile elements (27Rundell K.W.

Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 119-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this interaction may be important to the physiological regulation of enzyme activity (40Rundell K.W. Tullson P.C. Terjung R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C294-C299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Information regardingAMPD3 has been conflicting; with one study showing similar binding capacities of adult rat heart (AMPD3) and skeletal muscle (AMPD1) enzymes (32Ogasawara N. Goto H. Yamada Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 524: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and another study revealing very low myosin binding potential of the heart activity (33Shiraki H. Ogawa H. Matsuda Y. Nakagawa H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 566: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Using anin vitro assay, the present study has demonstrated different skeletal muscle actomyosin binding capacities for humanAMPD1 and AMPD3 recombinant proteins and has also revealed divergent effects of their N-terminal regions on this interaction. The N-terminal 95 amino acids in AMPD1 enhance actomyosin binding, whereas the 89 N-terminal residues inAMPD3 diminish this association. These data underscore a structural role for the N-terminal region of the polypeptide in modulating access of a myosin-binding domain located in another part of the molecule. AMPD1/AMPD3 hybrid enzymes also bind to skeletal muscle actomyosin, conferring additional potential relevance to these molecules in the clinical situations described above.A new model for AMPD quarternary structure has been proposed recently, based on information generated from the purified rabbit skeletal muscle enzyme. A putative skeletal muscle isoform of histidine-proline-rich glycoprotein (HPRG), an abundant plasma protein, co-purifies with rabbit skeletal muscle AMPD containing near full-sized subunits (41Ranieri-Raggi M. Montali U. Ronca F. Sabbatini A. Brown P.E. Moir A.J.G. Raggi A. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Limited tryptic digestion reportedly yields a 222-kDa trimeric enzyme comprising 72-kDa subunits truncated to leucine residue 96 (15Ranieri-Raggi M. Raggi A. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 755-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 19Ronca F. Ranieri-Raggi M. Brown P.E. Moir A.J.G. Raggi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This combined information has been used to develop a model in which one 75-kDa subunit of skeletal muscle HPRG assembles with three 79-kDaAMPD1 subunits to form an observed 309-kDa hybrid tetrameric protein (41Ranieri-Raggi M. Montali U. Ronca F. Sabbatini A. Brown P.E. Moir A.J.G. Raggi A. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Subsequent N-terminal proteolysis dissociates the HPRG subunit from the hybrid tetrameric enzyme and produces a trimeric N-truncated AMPD. Therefore, this model suggests that the N-terminal region of rabbit skeletal muscle AMPD plays a structural role in assembly of the hybrid tetramer. Moreover, the HPRG-like polypeptide must outcompete a fourth AMPD subunit during assembly of the hybrid tetramer, or subsequently displace one following assembly of a homotetrameric AMPD1 enzyme.Available information from a variety of other sources and results presented in this study are not consistent with the trimeric AMPD-monomeric HPRG hybrid model of rabbit skeletal muscle AMPD. Smaller than predicted subunit molecular masses ranging from 60 to 72 kDa are observed when AMPD is purified from rabbit (13Stankiewicz A. Spychala J. Skladanowski A. Zydowo M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1979; 62B: 363-369Google Scholar, 14O'Driscoll D. Roring N.P. Ross C.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1976; 4: 928-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), rat (11Coffee C.J. Kofke W.A. J.

However, native masses ranging from 238 to 328 kDa are approximately 4 times the observed subunit molecular mass in each case. Skeletal muscle AMPD enzymes in all mammalian species, including rabbit, are highly conserved in the N-terminal region of the polypeptide (10Sabina R.L. Fishbein W.N. Pezeshkpour G. Clarke P.R.H. Holmes E.W. Neurology. 1990; 42: 170-179Crossref Google Scholar, 19Ronca F. Ranieri-Raggi M. Brown P.E. Moir A.J.G. Raggi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and, thus, are likely to exhibit similar structural features. These combined data strongly suggest that AMPD1 enzymes purified from mammalian skeletal muscle are tetramers comprising proteolyzed subunits. Moreover, the apparent native molecular mass of the ΔL96AMPD1 enzyme demonstrates that this human recombinant model of the reported trimeric N-truncated rabbit muscle enzyme assembles into a homotetrameric structure. Finally, the removal of up to 98 N-terminal amino acid residues from the wild type AMPD1 recombinant polypeptide during storage at 4 °C does not result in a trimeric enzyme.Whereas N-truncated subunits are evident in enzymes purified from endogenous sources, a growing body of evidence suggests that these activities may not accurately reflect physiological behavior of AMPD. Divergent N-terminal domains in AMPD isoforms influence contractile protein-binding properties of the enzyme (Fig. 7) and facilitate regulation by ATP under mildly acidic conditions typical of skeletal muscle exercise (19Ronca F. Ranieri-Raggi M. Brown P.E. Moir A.J.G. Raggi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Ongoing studies are aimed at further characterization of divergent N-terminal domains in AMPD isoform function.

AMPD plays important biochemical and physiological roles in energy metabolism by competing with cytosolic 5′-nucleotidases for available AMP.

However, cDNA sequences indicate polypeptides with greater subunit molecular masses than those typically observed in enzymes purified from endogenous sources.

In controlled experiments, limited tryptic digestion of rabbit skeletal muscle AMPD produces an enzyme comprising subunits truncated to leucine residue 96, exhibiting kinetic and electrophoretic properties that are similar to the endogenous enzyme stored at 4 °C (15Ranieri-Raggi M.

This implies, but does not demonstrate, that N-terminal tryptic proteolysis may be responsible for smaller subunit molecular masses of purified AMPD enzymes. Availability of molecular reagents for the various gene-specific products of the mammalian AMPD multigene family should facilitate the characterization of this diverse enzyme through the production of wild type and genetically modified recombinant activities. Previously, prokaryotic expression of human and rodent AMPD1 andAMPD3 cDNAs has produced AMPD activities that are immunologically similar to the purified endogenous enzymes (20Morisaki H. Morisaki T.

SpCCE1 also binds and cleaves a range of other DNAs (Y-junction; flap; and flayed, nicked, and partial duplexes) with varying efficiency. Cleavage sites are always 3′ of thymine nucleotides positioned at or close to the branch point or strand interruption.SpCCE1's favored substrate is the X-junction. Up to two dimers of SpCCE1 can bind concurrently to the same X-junction at its crossover point. From mixing experiments ofSpCCE1 and the Escherichia coli RuvA protein, we show that each dimer of SpCCE1 binds to a different face of the X-junction and that both are seemingly competent for strand cleavage. We propose that this provides a mechanism wherebySpCCE1 can scrutinize all four junction strands simultaneously for cleavable thymine nucleotides. SpCCE1 appears to resolve X-junctions by a nick and counter-nick mechanism. Therefore, to ensure a high probability of bilateral strand cleavage,SpCCE1 has a relatively long lifetime on X-junctions. This mechanism has the drawback of limiting dissociation from noncleavable junctions. We discuss why this might not be a problem in vivo.

Homologous recombination plays a central role in DNA metabolism;e.g. it provides a mechanism for the faithful repair of double strand breaks, facilitates the removal of lesions in single strand gaps, ensures the completion of DNA replication by helping to reform collapsed replication forks, and functions during meiosis to promote the correct segregation of homologous chromosomes. In addition, the genome rearrangements that are a consequence of recombination are an important component in the generation of genetic diversity. A key intermediate of the recombination reaction is the Holliday junction, which consists of two double-stranded DNA molecules linked by a reciprocal crossover of single strands. Cleavage of a pair of symmetrical strands at the Holliday junction by a junction-specific endonuclease and sealing of the nicks by a DNA ligase generates classical “patch” or “splice” recombinant products. To date, six junction-resolving enzymes have been cloned representing eubacteria (RuvC), bacteriophage (T4 endonuclease VII, T7 endonuclease I, and lambdoid RusA), and eucarya (CCE1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and SpCCE1 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe) (1White M.F.

Aside from these common properties, there are further features that divide resolvases into two main groups. Group I enzymes, which include RuvC, RusA, CCE1, and SpCCE1, are distinguished by their high level of selectivity for Holliday junctions and by a degree of sequence specificity at the resolution step (2Whitby M.C.

Biol. 1993; 233: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) as well as Holliday junctions. In accord with these in vitroproperties, group I enzymes appear to play specialized roles in recombination, whereas group II enzymes act both in recombination and in the removal of branch structures from phage DNA prior to packaging. SpCCE1 (or YDC2) is the most recently cloned and characterized Holliday junction resolvase (2Whitby M.C. Dixon J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 509-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 3White M.F. Lilley D.M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6465-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 4Oram M. Keeley A. Tsaneva I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Its activity was originally identified in fractionated extracts from S. pombe, but it was cloned based on its sequence identity to CCE1 from S. cerevisiae. The 30.2-kDa SpCCE1 protein shares 28% sequence identity and approximately 50% sequence similarity with the 41-kDa CCE1 protein. Both enzymes cleave X-junctions 3′ of thymine nucleotides positioned at or just 3′ of the crossover point. However, an observed difference in preferred cut sites within a synthetic Holliday junction indicates that they do have different sequence specificities for cleavage (3White M.F. Lilley D.M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6465-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The likeness between SpCCE1 and CCE1 indicates that they may perform similar functions in vivo. In accord with this, both enzymes are encoded within the nucleus but localize to mitochondria (27Ezekiel U.R. Zassenhaus H.P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 240: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). 1M. C. Whitby and J. Dixon, unpublished data. 1M. C. Whitby and J. Dixon, unpublished data. Furthermore, mutations in both CCE1 and SpCCE1 have no observable effect on nuclear recombination (28Kleff S. Kemper B. Sternglanz R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).1 In cce1 mutants, mitochondrial DNA is aggregated seemingly due to an accumulation of recombination junctions linking the DNAs together (29Lockshon D. Zweifel S.G. Freemancook L.L. Lorimer H.E. Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Cell. 1995; 81: 947-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). As a consequence of this, mitochondrial DNA segregation is effected and results in an increase in the frequency of petite cells (28Kleff S. Kemper B. Sternglanz R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 29Lockshon D. Zweifel S.G. Freemancook L.L. Lorimer H.E. Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Cell. 1995; 81: 947-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We are currently investigating whether our Spcce1 mutant has similar phenotypes. In this work, we concentrate on the in vitro properties ofSpCCE1, extending our and others' previous characterization of the protein. In particular, we focus on how SpCCE1 recognizes and targets Holliday junctions, a question that remains largely unanswered for any resolvase. We also examine howSpCCE1 ensures that junctions are resolved properly by the introduction of two symmetrical strand incisions. RuvA was a gift from Robert Lloyd (University of Nottingham) and was purified as described (30Lloyd R.G. Sharples G.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1719-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).SpCCE1 was purified as described below. Amounts of both proteins were estimated by a modified Bradford assay using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit and bovine serum albumin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as the standard. Concentrations of these proteins are expressed in moles of monomers. T4 polynucleotide kinase was from Boehringer Mannheim, and [γ-32P]ATP was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other reagents were from Sigma, BDH, and NBL Gene Sciences Ltd. and were of analytical grade. Standard SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of protein samples was conducted using 12.5% gels. Broad range protein marker was from New England Biolabs. Protein samples were mixed with SDS loading buffer (100 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 200 mmDTT, 2The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol. 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol) and boiled for 5 min before electrophoresis. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, silver (31Morrissey J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2932) Google Scholar), or Sypro Orange (Bio-Rad). Gels stained with Sypro Orange were visualized using a model 575 Fluorimager (Molecular Dynamics). 1-Liter batches of BL21 (DE3) plysS (32Studier F.W. Moffat B. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4809) Google Scholar) transformed with pMW206 (2Whitby M.C. Dixon J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 509-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) were grown with aeration at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol. At a cell density corresponding to an A 600 of 0.5,SpCCE1 was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm and incubated for a further 3 h. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 30 ml of lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mmEDTA, 5% glycerol), and stored at −80 °C until required. Under these conditions, SpCCE1 was induced to approximately 5% of the total cell protein. The purification ofSpCCE1 was monitored throughout by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and by assaying for junction cleavage activity using X-12. Frozen cells (120 ml) from 4 liters of induced culture were thawed at room temperature and then mixed on ice with 30 ml of 5m NaCl, 0.75 ml of 200 mm DTT, 1.5 ml of 10% Triton X-100, and 0.75 ml of 200 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysis was completed by a single passage of the mixture through a French pressure cell at 30,000 p.s.i., and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 19,000 rpm for 60 min at 4 °C using a Beckman JA20 rotor. Approximately 60% of the SpCCE1 was removed with the cell debris. Following lysis, all steps were performed at 4 °C. The soluble lysate fraction (∼150 ml) was dialyzed against 4 liters of buffer A (Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol) containing 0.5 m KCl and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Following centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min to remove traces of insoluble material, the dialyzed sample was applied to a phosphocellulose P11 (Whatman) column (30-ml bed volume) equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.5 m KCl. The column was washed with 205 ml of the same buffer before eluting bound proteins (includingSpCCE1) with 150 ml of buffer A containing 0.7 mKCl. Eluted SpCCE1 was dialyzed against 4 liters of buffer A containing 0.3 m KCl for 3 h and applied to a double-stranded DNA cellulose (Sigma) column (8-ml bed volume) equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was then washed with 64 ml of the same buffer, and bound protein was eluted with 40 ml of buffer A containing 0.45 m KCl. The eluted protein was dialyzed against 2 liters of buffer A containing 0.2 m KCl for 3 h and applied to a prepacked 1-ml Mono S column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which was then washed with 10 ml of the same buffer. Bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient from 0.2 to 0.6m KCl in 8 ml and then by a further 6 ml of buffer A containing 0.6 m KCl. SpCCE1 eluted in the 0.6m KCl column fractions. The peak of these fractions (3 ml) was pooled and applied in 0.5-ml batches to a prepacked Superose 12 HR gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The six column runs were each developed with 25 ml of buffer A containing 0.1 mKCl. The majority of SpCCE1 eluted as a single peak with a molecular mass determined to be 33 kDa by comparison with protein standards (Bio-Rad) analyzed using the same buffer. However, a significant proportion of the protein eluted in later fractions, suggesting a tendency for SpCCE1 to stick to the Superose 12 column. The peaks of SpCCE1 from the six Superose 12 column runs were pooled, dialyzed against protein storage buffer (Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mKCl, 50% glycerol), and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. The yield was approximately 2 mg of SpCCE1 (in 10 ml).SpCCE1121RWGTP, which will be described in greater detail elsewhere, was purified from 1 liter of induced cells using a scaled down version of the above strategy. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 380B DNA synthesizer using cyanoethyl chemistry. Each oligonucleotide was deprotected, precipitated in ethanol, and purified on a 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel containing 7 murea. The bands containing full-length oligonucleotides were cut out and extracted from the gel by soaking in water overnight. DNA substrates were made by annealing combinations of oligonucleotides as indicated in Table I following the procedures of Parsons et al. (33Parsons C.A. Kemper B. West S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9285-9289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to annealing, DNA substrates were labeled at the 5′-end of one of their component oligonucleotides as indicated using [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase. Annealed substrates were purified by nondenaturing electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide gels followed by electroelution. The concentration of DNA substrates was estimated by relating the specific activity of the labeled oligonucleotide to the activity of the purified substrate and is expressed in molar concentrations of DNA substrate.Table ISynthetic DNA substratesEach substrate is made from the oligonucleotides indicated by number on each respective schematic. The number is positioned at the 5′-end of its respective oligonucleotide. Open table in a new tab Each substrate is made from the oligonucleotides indicated by number on each respective schematic. The number is positioned at the 5′-end of its respective oligonucleotide. Reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained labeled substrate DNA in binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 6% glycerol) containing NaCl (200 mm), EDTA (5 mm), and MgCl2 (10 mm) as indicated. Reactions were started typically by the addition of protein, were incubated on ice or at 37 °C as indicated, and then were loaded onto a 4% native polyacrylamide gel in low ionic strength buffer (6.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 3.3 mm sodium acetate, 2 mm EDTA). Competitor DNA (poly(dI·dC)-poly(dI·dC)) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) added during the course of some reactions was mixed in by pipetting. Electrophoresis of gels was typically for 2 h at 160 V. For time course experiments assessing binding stabilities, samples were loaded onto gels already running at 200 V. Following loading of all of the samples, the voltage was reduced to 160 V, and electrophoresis continued for a further 1 h and 20 min. For all experiments, both buffer and gel were precooled at 4 °C, and the electrophoresis was at room temperature with continuous buffer recirculation. Gels were dried on 3 MM Whatman paper, quantified using a model SF PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics), and autoradiographed. Reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained labeled substrate DNA in binding buffer containing NaCl (200 mm), MgCl2 (10 mm), and protein as indicated. After incubation at 37 °C typically for 20 or 30 min, reactions were terminated by adding one-fifth volume of stop mix (2.5% SDS, 200 mm EDTA, 10 mg/ml proteinase K) and incubating for a further 10 min at 37 °C to deproteinize the mixture. Products were analyzed by electrophoresis through 10% native polyacrylamide gels at 190 V using a standard Tris borate buffer system, or 11% denaturing gels containing 7 m urea. For native gels, deproteinized reactions were loaded directly onto the gel. For denaturing gels, reactions were extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and the DNA was precipitated with ethanol, resuspended in gel loading buffer (0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.05% (w/v) xylene cyanol, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, 97.5% (v/v) formamide), and denatured by boiling for 2 min before loading onto the gel. To map the sites of cleavage, detected by denaturing gel analysis, Maxam-Gilbert sequencing ladders of each labeled oligonucleotide were used (34Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9008) Google Scholar). A 1.5-base allowance was made to compensate for the nucleoside eliminated in the sequencing reaction. Gels were dried on 3 MM Whatman paper, quantified using a model SF PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics), and autoradiographed. Binding reactions (40 μl) containing 86 ng of SpCCE1 and 32 ng of X-0, labeled in one of its four strands, were set up, in binding buffer containing 2 mm EDTA and 200 mm NaCl, in parallel with control reactions containing no protein. Following incubation on ice, binding reactions were run on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in low ionic strength buffer. Electrophoresis was at 4 °C for 2 h at 160 V with continuous circulation of buffer. X-0 and SpCCE1-X-0 complexes were detected by autoradiography at 4 °C, and the appropriate bands were excised from the gel, chopped into evenly sized small pieces, and immersed in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). 10 μl of OP-Cu mix (2 mm 1,10-phenanthroline and 0.45 mmCuSO4) and 10 μl of 58 mm mercaptoproprionic acid were then added, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 28 mm 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (35Sigman D.S. Kuwabara M.D. Chen C.-H.B. Bruce T.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 414-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). 270 μl of 0.5m ammonium acetate, 1 mm EDTA was then added, and the DNA was eluted from the gel by incubation overnight at 37 °C with agitation in a thermomixer (Eppendorf). The DNA was then precipitated with ethanol, washed twice with 70% ethanol, resuspended in loading dye (98% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.05% xylene cyanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue) plus 10 mm NaOH, and electrophoresed on a 15% polyacrylamide sequencing gel containing 7m urea. Maxam-Gilbert sequencing ladders of each labeled oligonucleotide were used to map the protected sites. Gels were dried and analyzed using a model SF PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics) and by autoradiography. Previously, we have described the purification of the SpCCE1 protein of S. pombe as a histidine-tagged recombinant from Escherichia coli cells (2Whitby M.C. Dixon J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 509-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have developed a new strategy for purifying SpCCE1 without a histidine tag from E. coli cells (see “Materials and Methods”). This yielded approximately 2 mg of SpCCE1 from 4 liters of induced cells at >95% homogeneity as judged by Coomassie Blue, silver, and Sypro Orange staining of SDS gels (Fig. 1 and data not shown). This relatively poor yield of protein was due to the insolubility of the majority of the induced protein. Subsequent studies have shown that inducing cells at 25 °C greatly improves the solubility of SpCCE1, resulting in much higher yields of protein using the same purification strategy (data not shown). For the studies presented here, we also purified a mutant form ofSpCCE1 containing a five-amino acid (RWGTP) insertion after the tyrosine at position 121 using the same strategy as for wild-typeSpCCE1 (Fig. 1 , lane c).SpCCE1121RWGTP binds to Holliday junctions like wild-type protein but has little cleavage activity.1 A number of proteins, including SpCCE1, have been described that bind to Holliday junctions in a structure-specific rather than sequence-specific manner. To provide some insight into how this is achieved by SpCCE1, we began to characterize its interaction with model Holliday junctionsin vitro. For these studies, we used two different but sequence-related Holliday junctions. X-12 is composed of four 50–52-base-long oligonucleotides that anneal to form an X-junction with a central 12-base pair core of homology in which the junction point is free to branch migrate. X-0 shares one common oligonucleotide with X-12 but has no central core of homology, so its junction point is fixed. Binding of SpCCE1 to both X-12 and X-0 is readily detected by a band shift assay (Fig.2 A). When increasing concentrations of SpCCE1 are incubated with either X-12 or X-0 in the presence of 200 mm NaCl and a buffer containing 6% glycerol, two protein-DNA complexes are formed. Complex 1 is formed by the binding of a dimer of SpCCE1 (lanes b andc and lanes g and h), and complex 2 results from the binding of two dimers of SpCCE1 (lanes d–f and i–k) (2Whitby M.C. Dixon J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 509-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 3White M.F. Lilley D.M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6465-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The omission of glycerol from the binding buffer dramatically reduces the formation of complex 2 (Ref. 3White M.F. Lilley D.M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6465-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar and data not shown). Furthermore, the half-life of complex 2 is considerably shorter than that of complex 1 (Fig. 9 and data not shown). These data show that complex 2 is less stable than complex 1 and indicate that the binding of a second dimer ofSpCCE1 to an X-junction is hindered by the dimer that is already bound and/or that binding occurs at a site that is not equivalent to that of the first dimer.Figure 9Dissociation of SpCCE1 from X-junctions. A, band shift analysis of dissociation ofSpCCE1 from X-12 and X-0. Reactions (80 μl) contained 18 nm SpCCE1 and 2.3 nm32P-labeled X-12 or X-0 in binding buffer plus 200 mm NaCl and 5 mm EDTA.

https://openalex.org/W2040035676,"RNase T was first identified as an enzyme responsible for end turnover of tRNA in Escherichia coli. Its activity, specific for tRNA-C-C-A, catalyzes the release of tRNA-C-C and AMP. RNase T, along with several other RNases, plays a role in maturation of several other RNA species by a similar limited nuclease activity. In previous work, we identified the gene for RNase T, rnt, as a high copy suppressor of the UV sensitivity conferred by deficiency in three single-strand DNA-specific exonucleases, RecJ, exonuclease I, and exonuclease VII. This suggested that RNase T may process DNA substrates as well. In this work, we show that purified RNase T possesses a potent 3′ to 5′ single-strand DNA-specific exonucleolytic activity. Its K m for single-strand DNA substrates is many orders of magnitude lower than that for tRNA, suggesting that single-strand DNA may be a natural biological substrate for RNase T. We suggest that the DNase activity of RNase T may play a role in end trimming reactions during DNA recombination and/or DNA repair.

We suggest that the DNase activity of RNase T may play a role in end trimming reactions during DNA recombination and/or DNA repair. RNase T of Escherichia coli was identified as a 3′ exoribonuclease due to its ability to remove the terminal adenine residue from uncharged tRNA-C-C-A molecules (1Deutscher M.P. Marlor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7067-7071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to this end turnover reaction, RNase T is one of several enzymes that can remove 3′ residues in the maturation of tRNA (2Li Z. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6064-6071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RNase T is also responsible for the removal of the two 3′ terminal residues in the processing of 5S RNA. In rnt (RNase T−) mutants, no mature 5S RNA is found, but the incompletely processed 5S RNA is present in ribosomes and apparently functions normally in translation (3Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6883-6886Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We isolatedrnt multiple times in a high copy suppression screen as a gene that could restore UV irradiation resistance to a mutant deficient in the three known single-strand DNA (ssDNA) 1The abbreviations used are: ss, single-strand; ds, double-strand. exonucleases ofE. coli. 2M. Viswanathan, A. Lanjuin, and S. T. Lovett, unpublished observations. The three single-strand DNA exonucleases of E. coli, RecJ exonuclease, exonuclease I, and exonuclease VII, play somewhat redundant roles in promoting UV survival. A mutant deficient in all three shows a profound sensitivity, whereas any single mutant has only a minor defect (4Viswanathan M. Lovett S.T. Genetics. 1998; 149: 7-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RecJ exonuclease is specific for 5′ ends of single-strand DNA (5Lovett S.T. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2627-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), exonuclease I is specific for 3′ ends (6Lehman I.R. Nussbaum A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2628-2636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and exonuclease VII has dual polarity (7Chase J.W. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4553-4561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have proposed that these exonucleases are required to process daughter-strand gaps in DNA to allow recombinational repair of replication forks blocked by photodimer lesions (4Viswanathan M. Lovett S.T. Genetics. 1998; 149: 7-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The identification of rnt as a suppressor of this repair defect immediately suggested that RNase T may also be able to process DNA substrates. Consistent with this notion RNase T shares motifs with other DNases including exonuclease I and the 3′ to 5′ proofreading exonucleases of the three E. coli DNA polymerases (8Moser M.J. Holley W.R. Chatterjee A. Mian I.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 5110-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 9Koonin E.V. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 604-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We report here that overexpression of RNase T concomitantly induces high levels of a DNase activity on ssDNA in crude extracts. We have purified the RNase T protein to homogeneity, both in the native form and as a His6-tagged fusion protein. The DNase activity of RNase T is specific for ssDNA, acts in a 3′ to 5′ polarity, and is distributive in nature. In contrast to its limited degradation of RNA substrates, RNase T is capable of degrading 40-kilobase bacteriophage T7 ssDNA molecules to 70% completion. The kinetics of DNA degradation are comparable with other DNases of E. coliand suggest that RNase T may be a much more potent DNase than RNase. This suggests that DNA may be a natural substrate for RNase T and that RNase T may play a role in DNA metabolism in vivo. The STL2350 strain (xonA2 recJ284::Tn10 Δ(xseA-guaB) zff-3139::Tn10kan) was used for RNase T protein expression and purification due to its attenuated background DNase activity. To induce expression from the T7 φ10 promoter, the plasmid pTJH30 (10Haggerty T.J. Lovett S.T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6705-6713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) carrying the gene for the T7 RNA polymerase under control of the λPL promoter and the λcI857 repressor gene was introduced into STL2350 by transformation (11Chung C.T. Niemela S.L. Miller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2172-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar) and selection for chloramphenicol resistance. pAL1, conferring resistance to ampicillin, contains a 1.1-kilobase pair Sau3A fragment of E. coli genomic DNA (from strain STL2701 (xonA300:cat recJ2052::Tn10kan Δ(xseA-guaB) zff-3139::Tn10kan) inserted into the uniqueBamHI site of vector pBSSK− (Stratagene, Inc.) with the rnt gene under T7 promoter control. pAL1 was isolated in a high copy suppression screen.1 Plasmid pAL5, a derivative of pAL1 with a frameshift mutation 22 base pairs downstream from the initiation codon of rnt, was constructed by cleavage of pAL1 DNA with restriction endonuclease AgeI, “fill-in” synthesis with Klenow fragment (DNA polymerase I) and blunt end DNA ligation. For protein expression experiments, plasmids pAL1, pAL5 or vector pBSSK− were transformed into STL2350/pTJH30 cells, selecting ampicillin resistance (strain STL4020 is the pTJH30/pAL1 transformant of STL2350 used for protein purification). STL2329 (λDE3 sbcB15 recJ284::Tn10 endA Δ(xth-pncA)) carries an isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible T7 RNA polymerase gene (12Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4831) Google Scholar). This strain was used to express and purify a NH2-His6-tagged RNase T fusion protein expressed from plasmid pKD1. The rnt gene was amplified using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, Inc.) from plasmid pAL1 using primers 5′-GGGGATCCATGTCCGATAACGCTCAAC-3′ and 5′-GGGGGTCGACTTACACCTCTTCGGCGGC-3′ and buffer conditions recommended by the manufacturer. The polymerase chain reaction product was subsequently digested with restriction endonucleases BamHI and SalI and ligated into the pET28a(+) vector (Novogen), producing pKD1. pKD1 was introduced into STL2329 by transformation to kanamycin resistance. Sequence analysis verified the construct was error-free. All restriction endonucleases, T4 polynucleotide kinase, DNA ligase, and Klenow fragment (DNA polymerase I) were obtained from New England Biolabs Inc. Shrimp alkaline phosphatase was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Lysozyme was obtained from United States Biochemical Corp. Uniformly labeled bacteriophage T7 3H DNA with a specific activity of 2.2 × 104 cpm/nmol of nucleotide was prepared as described previously (5Lovett S.T. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2627-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) using [3H]thymidine (NEN Life Science Products). 3′ end-labeled substrate with a specific activity of 2.9 × 105 cpm/pmol terminal nucleotide was generated by Klenow fragment fill-in synthesis of HindIII-digested pBSSK− DNA with [33P]dATP. 5′ end-labeled substrate was generated from EcoRV-digested pBSSK′ DNA, treated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase and phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-33P] ATP to a specific activity of 3.3 × 105 cpm/pmol terminal nucleotide. 3′ and 5′ end-labeled substrates were purified using a Qiagen QiaExII kit. Unless otherwise stated, enzyme assays employed either 0.5 μg (1.5 nmol) of T7 3H DNA or 0.2 μg (0.2 pmol of ends) of 3′ or 5′ end-labeled substrate. For ssDNA assays, substrates were incubated for 5 min at 100 °C then quenched on ice. Standard reactions contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in 50 μl. Experiments with pH alterations were performed by changing the Tris pH. When required, protein samples were diluted in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Sample incubation, trichloroacetic acid precipitation, and soluble count determination were performed as described previously (4Viswanathan M. Lovett S.T. Genetics. 1998; 149: 7-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of DNase corresponds to the release of 1 nmol of acid-soluble product in a 20-min reaction at 37 °C. For agarose gel electrophoresis assays, 1 μg (1 pmol) of 3′ or 0.8 μg (0.8 pmol) of 5′ 33P end-labeled ssDNA substrate was incubated with either 0.2 ng (7.4 fmol protein monomer) or 1.1 μg (41 pmol protein monomer) of His6-RNase T, respectively. Standard assay conditions were used, and reactions were quenched on ice by addition of EDTA to 5.0 mm. Samples were boiled for 5 min and cooled on ice before loading onto a 1.0% agarose (Agarose NA, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gel. Gels were run at 80 V for 45 min in TAE buffer (13Ausubel F.A. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing and Wiley-Interscience, New York1989Google Scholar), dried at 80 °C for 1 h, and exposed to film. Native RNase T protein expression was induced from the T7 φ10 promoter of pAL1 by a two plasmid expression system in which the T7 RNA polymerase gene on plasmid pTJH30 was induced by temperature shift to 42 °C. T7-promoter-mediated expression of the His6-RNase fusion protein from plasmid pKD1 was induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside addition (1 mm) to a λDE3 lysogen strain STL4148 containing the T7 RNA polymerase gene resident in the lysogenic phage. Culture growth, [35S]methionine protein labeling, protein expression determinations, and crude extract preparations for both proteins were performed as described previously (10Haggerty T.J. Lovett S.T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6705-6713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured by the method of Bradford (14Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216178) Google Scholar) with standard reagent (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin standard. All proteins were resolved by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (13Ausubel F.A. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing and Wiley-Interscience, New York1989Google Scholar) and visualized by Coomassie staining and/or autoradiography. All steps were performed at 4 °C, and ssDNase activity on denatured T7 DNA was determined for each fraction as described above. The standard buffer (Buffer A) throughout the purification contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% (w/v) glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmdithiothreitol; various concentrations of NaCl and sodium phosphate were added as indicated. A 4-liter culture of STL4020 was grown, harvested, and stored frozen as described previously (4Viswanathan M. Lovett S.T. Genetics. 1998; 149: 7-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein expression was induced at 42 °C for 1.5 h and then continued at 37 °C for 8 h before harvesting cells. Crude extract was prepared by lysing cells in buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1.2 mg/ml lysozyme for 1 h on ice. Three cycles of freeze/thawing (2 min 37 °C, 2 min 0 °C) were performed before a supernatant was obtained by high speed centrifugation at 130,000 × g for 20 min (Fraction 1, 91 ml).The crude extract was applied to a 12-ml reactive blue-4 dye column (Sigma) equilibrated with Buffer A + 200 mm NaCl, and the ssDNase activity was eluted from a step gradient of Buffer A + 1.5 m NaCl. The active fractions were dialyzed against Buffer A + 50 mm sodium phosphate (Buffer B) and 50 mm NaCl (Fraction 2, 60 ml). Fraction 2 was applied to a 5-ml HTP-hydroxylapatite cartridge column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in Buffer B containing 50 mm NaCl. A 40-ml linear gradient from 50 to 1000 mm NaCl in Buffer B was applied with the ssDNase activity eluting at 750 mm NaCl (Fraction 3, 20 ml). Fraction 3 was dialyzed against Buffer A + 50 mm NaCl and applied to a 2-ml Affi-Gel Blue (Bio-Rad) column equilibrated in Buffer A containing 50 mm NaCl. The column was eluted with three-step salt gradients of Buffer A+ 300 mm, 800 mm, and 1.5 m NaCl. The majority of the ssDNase activity eluted in 1.5 m NaCl wash (Fraction 4, 22.5 ml) and was dialyzed against Buffer A + 50 mm NaCl. Fraction 4 was applied to a 1-ml DEAE-Sephadex (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column prepared according to manufacturer's instructions in Buffer A (without glycerol). An 18-ml linear gradient from 50 mm NaCl to 1m NaCl in Buffer A was applied with the ssDNase activity eluting at 800 mm NaCl (Fraction 5, 25 ml). The active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against Buffer A + 50 mmNaCl. The dialysate, containing 0.83 mg of protein was applied to a 1-ml Econopac MonoQ cartridge (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in Buffer A + 50 mm NaCl. A 24-ml linear gradient from 50 mmNaCl to 1 m NaCl in Buffer A was applied with a sharp peak of ssDNase activity eluted at 200 mm NaCl. The pooled fractions were dialyzed twice against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 60% glycerol and 1 mm dithiothreitol (Buffer C) and stored at −20 °C (Fraction 6, 2.3 ml). A 1-liter culture of STL4148 (pKD1 transformant of STL2329) was grown in 2× YT medium (12Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4831) Google Scholar) + 5 mm MgSO4 + 60 μg/ml kanamycin to an A 600 of 0.6, at which time isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. The culture was incubated for 8 h at 37 °C, and the cells were harvested, stored frozen, and lysed as above, producing a crude extract (Fraction 1, 42.5 ml). The crude extract was applied to a 5-ml Nickel-NTA agarose (Qiagen) column charged with 50 ml of 50 mm NiSO4 and equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 0.5m NaCl (Buffer D) containing 5 mm imidazole. The column was washed with 50 ml of Buffer D containing 60 mm imidazole, and the remaining protein was eluted with Buffer D containing 1 m imidazole. The eluted protein was dialyzed against Buffer C and stored at −20 °C (Fraction 2, 2.0 ml). The plasmid pAL1 containing the E. coli rntgene encoding RNase T was isolated in a screen for high copy suppressors which confer UV resistance to an E. coli strain deficient in the three known single-strand DNA exonucleases (4Viswanathan M. Lovett S.T. Genetics. 1998; 149: 7-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).1 Induction of rnt expression from the T7 promoter of pAL1 increases the production of a 24-kDa protein, consistent with the reported size of RNase T, which is absent from extracts of cells expressing a frameshift mutation withinrnt or carrying vector only (Fig.1). Crude extracts prepared from these induced cells were tested for DNase activity using uniformly3H-labeled T7 DNA substrates. Strains induced for expression of rnt exhibited an 18-fold increase in Mg2+ dependent DNase activity compared with cells carrying vector alone (Table I). This DNase activity was specific for ssDNA; no DNase activity was detected on double-strand DNA (dsDNA) substrates. This DNase activity, induced from plasmid pAL1 (strain STL4020), was purified to apparent homogeneity in six steps (Table II and Fig.2 A) and was found to copurify with the 24-kDa polypeptide induced by rntoverexpression.Table IOverexpressing RNase T increases Mg2+-dependent single-strand DNase activityPlasmidSubstrateMg2+Specific activitypAL1 (wild-typernt)ss+560pAL5 (rnt frameshift)ss+36.0pBSSK−(vector)ss+32.0pAL1ss−<0.1pAL5ss−<0.1pBSSK−ss−<0.1pAL1ds+3.4pAL5ds+2.8pBSSK−ds+3.7Nuclease assays were performed using crude extracts prepared from cells carrying the indicated plasmids.

In panel B SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on extracts from cells uninduced (lane 1) and induced (lane 2) for expression of the 28-kDa His6-RNase T fusion protein from plasmid pKD1. 0.5 μg of His6-RNase T protein (Fraction 2) purified by nickel agarose-chromatography is shown inlane 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Nuclease assays were performed using crude extracts prepared from cells carrying the indicated plasmids. Cells were induced for protein expression 20 min prior to assay. Assays were performed in the presence or absence of Mg2+ using ss or ds 3H T7 DNA substrates. Results are the averages of two determinations. A N-terminal His6-tagged RNase T protein was constructed and overexpressed from the T7 promoter on plasmid pKD1 in STL2329 (Fig.1). The protein had an apparent molecular mass of 27 kDa commensurate with the addition of six histidines and a T7 epitope tag. The His6-RNase T protein was purified to homogeneity using nickel agarose chromatography (Fig. 2 B and Table II). The specific ssDNase activity of purified His6-tagged RNase T was virtually identical to that for purified native RNase T (Table II) even though the two proteins were purified by different procedures. In reactions with denatured bacteriophage T7 DNA (40 kilobases in length), 0.1 μg (4.3 pmol) of purified RNase T (Fraction 6) could degrade 25% of the total DNA (0.5 μg, 1.5 nmol) in 20 min. Addition of larger amounts of protein resulted in increased digestion with up to 70% of the substrate DNA being degraded with 1.0 μg of RNase T (Fig.3). The extensive degradation of T7 DNA confirms that RNase T has little or no specificity for DNA sequence or structure. No endonuclease activity on ssDNA was observed in reactions with M13 virion circular ssDNA (data not shown), suggesting that the DNase activity of RNase T is exonucleolytic and not endonucleolytic in nature. Purified RNase T (Fraction 6) was used to determine optimal conditions for ssDNase activity. Similar to other nucleases, the ssDNase activity of RNase T was dependent upon the presence of a divalent cation; no detectable degradation was seen in its absence (Table III). Both Mg2+ and Mn2+ divalent cations serve as effective cofactors for RNase T. Whereas optimal activity was achieved with 10 mmMg2+ under our standard assay conditions (Fig.4 A), 95% relative activity was seen with 1 mm Mn2+ (Fig. 4 B). At higher concentrations, Mn2+ inhibited the enzyme in the presence of Mg2+ (Table III). Although other divalent cations such as Co2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, Ni2+, Ba2+, Ca2+, and Zn2+ were unable to substitute for Mg2+ (Table III), they inhibited ssDNase activity in a manner similar to Mn2+ (data not shown). RNase T showed optimal activity at pH 8.5 in the presence of Mg2+ (Fig. 4 C). The ssDNase activity of RNase T was reduced with increasing salt concentrations; a 50% decrease in activity was noted in the presence of 50 mm NaCl (Fig. 4 D). Bovine serum albumin enhanced the ssDNase activity of RNase T (Table III). The presence of ATP and the sulfhydryl reducing agent, dithiothreitol, did not alter ssDNase activity (Table III).Table IIIReaction requirementsAlteration to the complete reaction mixtureRelative activity%None100−Enzyme1−Dithiothreitol99−Bovine serum albumin90+ATP (100 mm)100+Mn2+(10 mm)aReaction also contains Mg2+.18−Mg2+1−Mg2+ + ATP (100 mm)1−Mg2+ + either Co2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, Ni2+, Ba2+, Ca2+, or Zn2+ (1 or 10 mm)1Reactions contained 40 ng of RNase T protein (Fraction 6) and 1.5 nmol of heat-denatured T7 DNA (as nucleotide).

The 100% relative activity corresponds to 0.5 nmol of acid soluble nucleotides. The DNase activities of both RNase T protein preparations were examined further on various end-labeled ssDNA substrates (Table IV). Both purified RNase T and the His6-RNase T showed efficient release of the terminal nucleotide from 3′ ssDNA ends. For RNase T (Fraction 6) this 3′ activity was much more efficient than release of terminal nucleotide from 5′ ssDNA ends. Release from 3′ dsDNA ends was apparent only at high concentrations of either enzyme preparation (4,000–6,000-fold more enzyme than that required to detect degradation of 3′ ssDNA ends). Virtually no activity was seen with 5′ labeled dsDNA. This implies that RNase T acts as a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease on ssDNA, the same polarity as its reported activity on RNA.Table IVSubstrate specificity of RNase TSubstrateNucleotide releasedRNase THis6 RNase Tfmol/ng enzyme5′ 33P ssDNA1.5ND5′ 33P dsDNA0.01ND3′33P ssDNA750064003′ 33P dsDNA2.01.1DNase assays using 5′ or 3′ end-labeled substrate were performed using purified RNase T or His6RNase T to determine the substrate specificity for each enzyme.

Reported values were determined in the linear range of enzyme activity. ND, not determined. A 3′ to 5′ polarity of digestion was confirmed by gel electrophoresis of RNase T reactions with end-labeled ssDNA. A 1:135 molar ratio of His6-RNase T protein to 3′-labeled ssDNA (protein monomers: 3′ DNA ends) produced a loss of the terminal 3′ label from nearly all the substrate DNA molecules by 9 min, without detectable shortening of the labeled DNA (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, incubation of His6-RNase T with 5′ end-labeled ssDNA at a molar ratio of 51:1 (protein monomers: 5′ DNA ends) resulted in progressive shortening of the labeled DNA with little loss of signal intensity at the earlier time points (Fig. 5 B). By 5 min the ssDNA molecules are either degraded completely or have become heterogeneous in size due to asynchronous digestion. These results are consistent with a 3′ to 5′ polarity of DNA degradation by RNase T. Furthermore, the degradation by RNase T must be via a distributive mechanism because the substrate molecules appear to be degraded uniformly from the 3′ end. This means that RNase T must dissociate and rebind to its ssDNA substrate during cycles of degradation and contrasts to a processive mechanism of DNA degradation exhibited by ssDNA exonucleases such as exonuclease I (15Thomas K.R. Olivera B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 424-429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and RecJ. 3S. T. Lovett and R. D. Kolodner, unpublished results. Electrophoretic analysis of similar time course reactions with purified native RNase T (Fraction 6) produced similar results (data not shown). Using the 3′ end-labeled ssDNA substrate, the extent of ssDNA degradation was determined for a substrate concentration range of 0.2–40 nm with 1.76 ng/ml (7.5 pm monomer) of RNase T (Fraction 6) in 5-min reactions using standard buffer conditions. An Eadie-Hofstee plot allowed the determination of theK m as 5 nm and aV max of 2 μmol/min mg for RNase T degradation of 3′ ssDNA ends (data not shown). We have demonstrated that RNase T of E. coli possesses a Mg2+-dependent 3′ to 5′ exonucleolytic activity on ssDNA. This ssDNase activity most likely accounts for the ability of rnt, in high copy, to suppress the UV repair defects of an E. coli mutant deficient in other ssDNA exonucleases, RecJ exonuclease, exonuclease I, and exonuclease VII. Unlike these latter ssDNases (7Chase J.W. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4553-4561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Thomas K.R. Olivera B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 424-429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), RNase T degrades DNA via a distributive mechanism. It may be for this reason that multiple copies of the rnt gene are required to overcome the repair deficiency conferred by mutations in the processive ssDNA exonucleases. Further investigation should reveal what role RNase T plays in aspects of DNA metabolism including DNA repair, recombination, and mutation avoidance. Mutants lacking RNase T grow more slowly than wild-type strains and recover poorly from starvation (16Padmanabha K.P. Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1376-1381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although this has been interpreted as a failure of RNA processing, DNA metabolism defects may also account for this phenotype (17Deutscher M.P. Marlor C.W. Zaniewski R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6427-6430Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We have found that optimal DNase activity of RNase T occurs under the same conditions determined optimal for its RNase activity (1Deutscher M.P. Marlor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7067-7071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DNase and RNase activity demonstrate the same spectrum of activity for most of the divalent cations tested. Whereas Co2+ has been shown to provide partial RNase activity (1Deutscher M.P. Marlor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7067-7071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is unable to provide any DNase activity. The K m of RNase T for ssDNA 3′ end degradation was 5 nm, which contrasts to aK m of 14 μm reported for the activity of RNase T on tRNA (1Deutscher M.P. Marlor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7067-7071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that DNA rather than RNA may be the preferred substrate for RNase T. The K m of DNA degradation by RNase T is comparable with other known DNases including exonuclease I (K m = 12 nm (18Brody R.S. Doherty K.G. Zimmerman P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7136-7143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and RecJ (K m = 1.5 nm). 4S. T. Lovett unpublished results. In contrast to the limited degradation of RNA substrates, RNase T can extensively degrade ssDNA substrates (approximately 30 kilobases in length). We do not, however, discount a role of RNase T in RNA metabolism. RNase T clearly affects RNA processing in vivo. In ccamutant strains deficient in tRNA nucleotidyltransferase, functional RNase T promotes the accumulation of tRNA-C-C molecules. Mutations in the rnt gene restore more normal growth rates tocca mutants presumably by blocking this end degradation (17Deutscher M.P. Marlor C.W. Zaniewski R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6427-6430Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Likewise, two nucleotide 3′ extensions of 5S rRNA accumulate inrnt mutants (3Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6883-6886Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). RNase T appears to be conserved in a number of proteobacterial species including E. coli, Hemophilus influenza,Vibrio alginolyticus, and Pasteurella hemolyticabut has not been found outside this division. In addition, the protein shares significant homology to the DNA polymerase III proofreading exonuclease domain of Gram-positive bacteria. RNase T shares a motif structure with several other 3′ to 5′ DNases, including E. coli exonuclease I and the proofreading exonuclease domains of the three E. coli DNA polymerases (8Moser M.J. Holley W.R. Chatterjee A. Mian I.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 5110-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 9Koonin E.V. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 604-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Four of these conserved acidic amino acids can be seen in the crystal structure ofE. coli polymerase I (Klenow fragment) to coordinate two divalent cations required for phosphodiester bond cleavage (19Beese L.S. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Because both its RNase and DNase activities are 3′ to 5′ in polarity, our expectation is that both DNA and RNA substrates are cleaved via the same active site on the enzyme, but this remains to be experimentally confirmed. Likewise, it is unknown whether dimerization of RNase T, required for its tRNA processing activity (20Li Z. Zhan L. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1133-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), is also required for ssDNase activity. Duality of polynucleotide substrates for exonucleases has been reported previously. Two 5′ exonucleases from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the products of the XRN1 (alternativelySEP1 or KEM1) and HKE1 genes, degrade both RNA and DNA substrates, although RNA substrates are apparently utilized more efficiently by both enzymes (21Stevens A. Poole T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16063-16069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Likewise, the 5′ exonucleases of T4 RNase H and E. coli DNA polymerase I degrade both RNA-DNA and DNA-DNA duplexes (22Hollingsworth H.C. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1888-1897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gutman P.D. Minton K.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4406-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because specificity for RNA or DNA is often not experimentally determined, ambiguity of polynucleotide substrates for enzymes may be a more common occurrence than is appreciated.

https://openalex.org/W1973635555,"<i>Spodoptera frugiperda</i> retinol dehydratase catalyzes the conversion of retinol to the<i>retro</i>-retinoid anhydroretinol. It shares sequence homology with the family of mammalian cytosolic sulfotransferases and provides the first link between sulfotransferases and retinol metabolism. In this study the enzymatic properties of retinol dehydratase were examined using bacterially expressed protein. We show that retinol dehydratase can catalyze the transfer of the sulfonate moiety to small phenolic compounds and exhibits many functional similarities to the mammalian cytosolic sulfotransferases. The bisubstrate reaction that it catalyzes between retinol and the universal sulfonate donor 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate seems to involve ternary complex formation and to proceed via a Random Bi Bi mechanism. In addition to the low nanomolar <i>K</i> <sub>m</sub> value for free retinol, retinol dehydratase is strongly inhibited by retinol metabolites, suggesting a preference for retinoids. Conversely, a number of tested mammalian cytosolic sulfotransferases do not utilize retinol, indicating that retinol is not a general substrate for sulfotransferases."
https://openalex.org/W2113534530,"Several series of site-directed mutations in thermolysin-like proteases are presented that show remarkable nonadditivity in their effect on thermal stability. A simple model is proposed that relates this nonadditivity to the occurrence of independent partial unfolding processes that occur in parallel at elevated temperatures. To prove this model, a thermolysin-like protease was designed in which two mutations located ∼35 Å apart in the structure individually exert small stabilizing effects of 2.3 and 4.1 °C, respectively, but when combined stabilize the protease by 14.6 °C. This overadditivity, which follows directly from the model, confirms that unfolding of this engineered protease starts in parallel at two different regions of the protein.

Long J.W. Bigbee W.L. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1103-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). As an alternative measure of stability, the kinetic parameter T 50can be used (7Vriend G.

If the irreversible processes that render aspecific proteases inactive at elevated temperatures were to be preceded by global unfolding, then small ΔT 50values should be additive. Below we show that this is not always the case.In this study, we exploit the fact that TLPs are substrate and enzyme at the same time to probe early steps in their unfolding. We show that data obtained from mutagenesis studies fit to a model for the early steps in unfolding that is based on the existence of multiple independent processes, each leading to a different partially unfolded form that is sufficiently unfolded and long-lived to be susceptible to autolysis.DISCUSSIONFor a long time, it was generally believed that unfolding of small proteins is fully cooperative and does not involve detectable intermediate states. Recent studies, mainly using NMR, have shown, however, that partially unfolded intermediate states do occur (34Baldwin R.L.

https://openalex.org/W2033073384,"The 5′-flanking region of the mouse μ opioid receptor (MOR) gene has two promoters, referred to as distal and proximal, and the activities of each in the brain are quite different from each other. The 5′-distal promoter regulatory sequences (5′-DPRS), positioned between these two promoters, have strong inhibitory effects on the reporter gene expression driven by the MOR distal promoter. In our studies, detailed 3′ deletion mapping of the 5′-DPRS narrowed down the negative cis-acting element to a 34-base pair (bp) segment (position −721 to −687). This 34-bp cis-acting element functions in both neuronal (NMB) and non-neuronal (CHO and RAW264.7) cultured cells. S1 nuclease protection assays indicated that this 34-bp cis-acting element suppresses distal promoter activity at the transcriptional level. Linker scanning mutagenesis demonstrated that nucleotides around position −721 and −689 in the 34-bp cis-acting element are essential for the regulation of distal promoter activity. Operational characterization of the 34-bpcis-acting element in the homologous MOR distal promoter and the heterologous SV40 promoter showed that its effects are position- and promoter-dependent while being orientation-independent in both promoters. Collectively, these data suggested that this 34-bp segment is a conditional transcriptionalcis-acting element that blocks mouse MOR gene expression from the distal promoter.

Opioid receptors mediate the diverse functions of endogenous opioid peptides and the opioid alkaloid derivatives of morphine, including analgesia, reward, autonomic reflexes, and endocrine/immune regulation (1Loh H.H.

Several opioid receptors have been discovered since their initial identification in the brain in 1973, and these receptors constitute three major types, referred to as μ, κ, and δ (4Snyder S.H. Science. 1984; 224: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 5Simonds W.F. Endocr. Rev. 1988; 9: 200-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 6Corbett A.D. Paterson S.J. Kosterliz H.W.

All are members of the heptahelical transmembrane receptor superfamily and are coupled to their effectors by heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) (7Mansour A. Fox C.A. Akil H. Watson S.J. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 22-29Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). The μ opioid receptor (MOR), 1The abbreviations used are: MOR, μ opioid receptor; 5′-DPRS, 5′-distal promoter regulatory sequences; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; UTR, untranslated region. the major molecular target of morphine, has been identified in discrete brain regions with differential expression levels (8Matthes H.W. Maldonado R. Simonin F. Valverde O. Slowe S. Kitchen I. Befort K. Dierich A. Le Meur M. Dolle P. Tzavara E. Hanoune J. Roques B.P. Kieffer B.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). A quantitative study of MOR mRNA in selected regions of the rat central nervous system showed that the medial thalamus has the highest levels while the cerebellum has the lowest (9Brodsky M. Elliott K. Hynansky A. Jenab S. Inturrisi C.E. Neuroreport. 1995; 27: 725-729Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The expression of MOR gene is inducible in response to a variety of physiological and neuronal activities, including continuous chemical depolarization, which has been reported to down-regulate MOR gene expression (10Simantov R. Levy R. Dev. Brain Res. 1986; 391: 301-304Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 11Simantov R. Levy R. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Similarly, studies have shown that MOR gene expression can be regulated in vivo. Animals treated for 7 days with haloperidol, a treatment shown to alter striatal enkephalin mRNA levels, exhibit markedly reduced expression levels of MOR in the globus pallidus (12Delfs J.M. Yu L. Ellison G.D. Reisine T. Chesselet M.-F. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 777-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that interleukin-1β, in primary astrocyte-enriched cultures, produced a 55–75% increase in the MOR transcript, depending on the brain regions sampled (13Ruzicka B.B. Akil H. Neuroscience. 1997; 79: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Taken together, these examples suggest that the expression of the MOR gene is temporally and spatially regulated. However, the detailed mechanisms governing MOR gene expression remain largely uninvestigated. MOR genomic DNA has been cloned in mouse and rat, and its promoter region has been characterized (14Min B.H. Augustin L.B. Felsheim R.F. Fuchs J.A. Loh H.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9081-9085Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 15Kraus J. Horn G. Zimprich A. Simon T. Mayor P. Hollt V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In our laboratory, transcription initiation studies of the mouse MOR gene have shown that there is a major promoter domain (position −450 to −249) proximal to the translation start site (14Min B.H. Augustin L.B. Felsheim R.F. Fuchs J.A. Loh H.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9081-9085Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 16Ko J.L. Minnerath S.R. Loh H.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A second promoter domain, distal to the translation start site, was identified at position −994 to −784 (17Liang Y. Mestek A. Yu L. Carr L.G. Brain Res. 1995; 679: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR using adult mouse brain mRNA has shown that the proximal promoter is 20-fold more active than the distal promoter (16Ko J.L. Minnerath S.R. Loh H.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Both promoters of the mouse MOR gene exhibit characteristics similar to housekeeping gene promoters, such as the lack of a TATA box, and multiple Sp1 binding sites (18Azizkhan J.C. Jesen D.E. Pierce A.J. Wade M. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1993; 3: 229-254PubMed Google Scholar). As these structural characteristics of MOR gene promoters predict, a recent anatomical study shows that MOR, which is presumed to be confined to the central nervous system, is also distributed in peripheral tissues (19Wittert G. Hope P. Pyle D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Studies have demonstrated that there is a strong inhibitory regulatory region (position −775 to position −444), referred to here as the 5′-distal promoter regulatory sequences (5′-DPRS), between the distal and proximal promoters of the mouse MOR gene (16Ko J.L. Minnerath S.R. Loh H.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). According to studies using deletional analysis and transfection assays, the 5′-DPRS strongly inhibited the activity of the luciferase reporter gene driven by the distal promoter in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y (16Ko J.L. Minnerath S.R. Loh H.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Because the 5′-DPRS has multiple translation start sites (ATG) and a potential folded structure, it has been proposed to have translational regulatory functions (17Liang Y. Mestek A. Yu L. Carr L.G. Brain Res. 1995; 679: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the present study, we identify thecis-acting element in the 5′-DPRS, comprised of a stretch of 34 nucleotides positioned between −721 and −687, which is responsible for the inhibition of distal promoter activity. This negative control element is functional in each cell line tested (NMB, CHO, and RAW264.7). The 34-bp segment exerts its positional effects in a promoter-specific fashion, while its orientation does not affect transcription in either promoter examined. Finally, our study suggests that the effects of this negative cis-acting element on the MOR distal promoter occur at the transcriptional level. pL1.3K/444 and pLup constructs have been described previously (16Ko J.L. Minnerath S.R. Loh H.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For deletional mutagenesis, 3′-deleted fragments of the 5′-flanking region (−1105 to −444) were generated from the pL1.3K/444 by PCR, with the sense primer bearing the Bfr1 site (−1105) and with all of the different positioned antisense primers bearing NcoI site and essential Kozak sequences (5′-CCATGGTG-3′) (21Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar). The resulting fragments were cloned into the pL1.3K/444 plasmid cut with Bfr1/NcoI restriction enzymes and confirmed by restriction digestion and DNA sequence analysis. The location of the 3′ end of each construct is specified in Fig. 2 A. For experiments testing the effect of position and orientation of the 34-bp cis-acting element, double-stranded oligonucleotides (5′-TTTGTGGGGTTGATTTTTTGAGGAACTAAAGGGG-3′) with restriction sites were phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase and cloned at the Bfr1 site of pL1.3K/721, at theHindIII site of pGL3-promoter plasmid (Promega), and at theSacI/BglI1 sites of pGL3-promoter vector, respectively. The 1.3K/721AS construct, in which the 34-bpcis-acting element is in antisense orientation in pL1.3K/721, was generated by PCR. The sequences of all constructs were verified by the dideoxynucleotide chain terminator sequencing method with the specific synthetic oligonucleotides as primers. For linker scanning mutagenesis, two fragments from the 5′-flanking sequences (−1105 to −678) were generated by PCR; for one fragment (Bfr1-SalI), with the sense primer bearing a Bfr1 restriction site (−1105) and with all of the different positioned antisense primers (5′-TGTCGACA-3′) bearing a SalI site (5′-GTCGAC-3′) flanked 3′ and 5′ with A and T, respectively, and for another fragment (SalI-NcoI), with all of the different positioned sense primers (5′-TGTCGACA-3′) bearing a SalI site flanked 3′ and 5′ with A and T, respectively, and antisense primers bearing a NcoI site (−678) and essential Kozak sequences. These fragments with the overlapped 8-bp Sal1 linker were cut with restriction enzymes and cloned into the pL1.3K/444 plasmid digested with Bfr1 and Nco1. The location of the substitution of the 8-bp linker is specified in Fig.4 A. Sequencing was carried out in both directions by the dideoxynucleotide chain terminator. Human neuroblastoma NMB and murine macrophage-like cell line RAW264.7 were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. Fibroblastoma of Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. For transfection, cells were plated 24 h prior to transfection at a density of 1 × 106 cells per plate in 6-well plates. Two transfection methods were performed in different experiments, and methods used in each experiment will be specified in the figure legend. Briefly, for the calcium phosphate-coprecipitation transfections, a DNA-CaCl2 mixture (1.5 pmol of MOR-luc reporter plasmid in 100 μl of 2.5 m CaCl2) was added dropwise to 100 μl of a transfection mixture (50 mm Hepes, 280 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmNa2HPO4, adjusted to pH 7.1). The precipitates were mixed by pipetting and applied dropwise directly to the cells and incubated at 37 °C. Twenty-four h post-transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with lysis buffer (Promega). The luciferase and β-galactosidase activities of each lysate were determined by a luminometer as described by the manufacturers (Promega and Tropix, respectively). In the second method, cells were transfected with construct plasmids using the SuperFect Transfection reagent (Qiagen) as described by the manufacturer. All transfection experiments were repeated four or more times with similar results, utilizing plasmids that were independently prepared at least twice. To correct the differences in transfection efficiency, one-fifth molar ratio pCH 110 plasmid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) containing β-galactosidase gene under the SV40 promoter was included in each transfection and used for normalization. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection of CHO cells on a 10-cm dish with 1.5 pmol of pL1.3K/444, pL1.3K/722, and pGL3-control. Total RNA was purified using Rneasy kit (Ambion). Another set of transfected cells was used simultaneously for a luciferase assay. For S1 nuclease protection assay, synthesized luciferase probe (71 nucleotides) and β-galactosidase probe (42 nucleotides) were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. To quantitate luciferase mRNA, 25 μg of total RNA from cells transfected with pL1.3K/444, pL1.3K/722, and pGL3-control was hybridized with 3 × 104 cpm of luciferase and β-galactosidase probes in hybridization solution (3m NaCl, 0.5 m Hepes, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA) for 10 min at 80 °C and overnight at 55 °C, followed by digestion with S1 nuclease. Protected probes were electrophoresed on a 5% polyacrylamide-8 m urea gel, and the dried gel was scanned and quantitated by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Previous studies have shown that the 5′-flanking region of the mouse μ opioid receptor (MOR) gene has two major promoters, referred to as proximal and distal (14Min B.H. Augustin L.B. Felsheim R.F. Fuchs J.A. Loh H.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9081-9085Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 16Ko J.L. Minnerath S.R. Loh H.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 17Liang Y. Mestek A. Yu L. Carr L.G. Brain Res. 1995; 679: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 20Liang Y. Carr L.G. Brain Res. 1997; 769: 372-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Previously, we showed that the sequences (−775/−444) in the 5′-flanking region suppress the expression of the pL1.3K/444 reporter construct in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, in which the distal promoter (−1326 to −444) is cloned into the luciferase reporter vector (16Ko J.L. Minnerath S.R. Loh H.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These sequences (−775/−444) are referred to here as the 5′-distal promoter regulatory sequences (5′-DPRS) (Fig. 1). To define specific sequences in the 5′-DPRS that inhibit the expression of the pL1.3K/444 reporter construct, the 5′-DPRS was subjected to detailed 3′ deletional mutagenesis. The 3′-deleted fragments of the 5′-flanking sequences (−1326 to −444) were generated by PCR and were cloned into pL1.3K/444 digested with NcoI andBfr1 (Fig. 2 A). The resulting luciferase reporter constructs were transiently transfected into the neuronal cell line NMB, which contains a proportion of endogenous MOR (15%) in addition to two other opioid receptors δ (60%) and κ (25%) (22Baumhaker Y. Ben-Dor T. Bar-hamburger R. Sarne Y. Brain Res. 1994; 665: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), since the low amount of MOR is speculated to be due to the suppression of the distal promoter. Parallel experiments were also carried out in non-neuronal cells RAW264.7 and CHO to determine whether the distal promoter is regulated in a tissue-specific pattern. Compared with pL1.3K/444, in which the entire 5′-DPRS segment is intact, constructs pL1.3K/508, pL1.3K/586, L1.3K/626, and pL1.3K/687 are not active in these cells (Fig. 2). The lack of a significant change in the luciferase activity of these constructs suggests that the segment between −687 and −444 in the 5′-DPRS does not have the negative cis-acting elements regulating the expression of the luciferase reporter gene. With progressive fine 3′ deletions to position −721, constructs pL1.3K/694, pL1.3K/702, pL1.3K/717, and pL1.3K/721 show significant increases in luciferase reporter activity, reaching a maximum of about 25-fold relative to pGL3-Basic in the NMB cell line. These findings suggest that the critical negativecis-acting element in the 5′-DPRS is a 34-bp segment located between −721 and −687. Further 3′ deletions from position −775 to −722 resulted in decreased luciferase activity to a maximum of a 70% decrease in activity in NMB cells (pL1.3K/728 and pLup). One interpretation of this biphasic response would be that this 54-bp region has a positive regulatory function, although this remains to be tested. Taken together, these results suggest that the 5′-DPRS has a very strong negative cis-acting element, located between position −721 and position −687, with an apparent positivecis-acting element at positions −775 to −721. In addition, these results indicate that this negative cis-acting element does not appear to be tissue-specific, as its deletion elicits the same effect on the luciferase activity in neuronal (NMB) and non-neuronal (CHO and RAW264.7) cells as shown in pL1.3K/728 construct. Although the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of mRNA is predominantly involved in translational control (23Kim S.-J. Park K. Koeller D. Kim K.Y. Wakefield L.M. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13702-13707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Patel R.C. Jocobs-Lorena M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1159-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Arrick R.A. Lee A.L. Grendell R.L. Derynck R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4306-4313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this region can also influence transcriptional activity (26Hershey J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Since the negative cis-acting element in the 5′-DPRS is located in the 5′-UTR, we speculated that its inhibitory effect on luciferase reporter activity shown in Fig. 2 may occur at the transcriptional level. To test this hypothesis, we tried to measure the amount of luciferase reporter transcript generated. Total RNAs were extracted from CHO cells that were transfected with pL1.3K/444 and pL1.3K/721. An S1 nuclease protection assay was run using the antisense oligonucleotide probes of luciferase (71 nucleotides) and β-galactosidase (42 nucleotides). As Fig. 3 shows, the transcript of pL1.3K/721 is 2-fold that of pL1.3K/444, suggesting that the essential 34-bp nucleotides in 5′-UTR identified in Fig. 2 constitute a transcriptional cis-acting element. Compared with the difference in luciferase reporter activity (more than 30-fold) between pL1.3K/444 and pL1.3K/721 in Fig. 2, the 2-fold difference in transcript level between them is relatively small. This result may be due to the rapid degradation of luciferase reporter mRNA or to the fact that the luciferase activity is not within the linear range of the relationship between the luciferase protein concentration and the amount of transcript. To further define the negative 34-bpcis-acting element (−721/−687), we utilized linker scanning mutagenesis. Linker oligonucleotides (5′-TGTCGACA-3′) containing the SalI site (5′-GTCGAC-3′) flanked with T and A were introduced to the MOR distal promoter fragment (−741 to −678) by PCR. These mutated fragments were subcloned into pL1.3K/444, and the resulting linker constructs were then transfected into NMB cells. The luciferase activities were expressed as fold activity over that of the promoterless plasmid (pGL3-Basic) (Fig.4 B). In these linker constructs, changing nucleotides −725 to −718 (Linker 3) and −693 to −686 (Linker 7) restored much of the distal promoter activity, suggesting that these two regions are essential for the negative effect of the 34-bp cis-acting element on the distal promoter (Fig. 4 B). Comparison of the deletion constructs pL1.3K/687 and pL1.3K/694 in Fig. 2 suggested that nucleotides at positions −687 to −694 are not important. Contrary to this proposal, mutation of these sequences in Linker 7 indicates that they act as a negative cis-acting element, suggesting that the regulatory function of these sequences depends on the DNA context. Taken together with the 3′ deletion studies (Fig, 2), the mutational analysis in Linker 3 confirmed that the sequences around nucleotide −721 are functionally important in mediating the effect of the 34-bpcis-acting element on the distal promoter. To further understand the configuration under which the 34-bp cis-acting element negatively exerts its effect on the promoters, this fragment was subcloned downstream of the distal promoter of pL1.3K/721 in the antisense orientation (1.3K/721AS). The resulting construct was transfected into NMB cells. As shown in Fig.5, the expression level of 1.3K/721AS is comparable with that of pL1.3K/687. This implies that the effect of this segment in the 5′-DPRS is independent of orientation. In addition, the promoter specificity of the negativecis-acting element was examined for its effect on the heterologous simian virus 40 (SV40) promoter and the homologous MOR distal promoter when placed in different positions. To do this, these sequences were subcloned upstream (SS1.3K/721 in the sense orientation and AS1.3K/721 in the antisense orientation) of the homologous MOR distal promoter and upstream (SS-SV40) and downstream (SV40SS in the sense orientation and SV40AS in the antisense orientation) of the heterologous SV40 promoter. The resulting constructs were transfected into the neuronal cell line NMB, which expresses endogenous MOR, and into non-neuronal cells RAW264.7 and CHO (Fig. 5). Regardless of its orientation or the cell lines tested, when positioned upstream of the distal promoter, the 34-bp cis-acting element did not effect distal promoter activity (SS1.3K/721 and AS1.3K/721), implying that it is position-dependent. In contrast with the homologous MOR distal promoter, the effects of the cis-acting element on the heterologous SV40 promoter were more noteworthy. When this segment is fused upstream of the SV40 promoter (SS-SV40), it exerts an inhibitory effect, whereas there was no inhibitory effect when located downstream of the SV40 promoter (SV40AS and SV40SS), regardless of its orientation in the cell lines tested. Taken together, these results indicate that the 34-bp negativecis-acting element in the 5′-DPRS of MOR gene is position- and promoter-dependent while being orientation-independent in both promoters. Previous studies have shown that the 5′-DPRS (−775 to −444) exerts negative control over the mouse MOR distal promoter (16Ko J.L. Minnerath S.R. Loh H.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 20Liang Y. Carr L.G. Brain Res. 1997; 769: 372-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Here we present a detailed analysis of 5′-DPRS as a first step toward understanding the mechanism of the regulation of the mouse MOR distal promoter. Our data indicate that the activity of the MOR distal promoter is controlled by the 34-bp cis-acting element (−721 to −687) at the transcriptional level. Transient transfection, using 3′-deleted mutations of pL1.3K/444, into the MOR expressing neuronal cell line NMB and non-expressing non-neuronal cells, CHO and RAW264.7, shows that the 34-bpcis-acting element has a very strong inhibitory effect on the expression of the luciferase reporter gene driven by the basal distal promoter in all three cell lines tested. In addition, since the basal distal promoter domain is active in all three cell lines it suggests that the 34-bp cis-acting element is not involved in regulating tissue-specific expression of the MOR gene, although a comprehensive survey of other cell lines remains to be performed. Similar results suggesting that the basal distal promoter is active in different cell lines, SK-N-SH, Neuro 2A, and HeLa, have been reported (20Liang Y. Carr L.G. Brain Res. 1997; 769: 372-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In some mRNAs the presence of multiple upstream translation start sites (ATG) has been reported to interfere with translation (21Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar). Considering this, the putative six translation start sites in the MOR 5′-DPRS (Fig. 1) were expected to be responsible for the inhibitory effect on the reporter gene expression at the translational level (20Liang Y. Carr L.G. Brain Res. 1997; 769: 372-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, our results show that deletion of the six translation start sites had no significant effect on the luciferase reporter gene activity, as shown by the expression level of the pL1.3K/687 construct (Fig. 2). This may be due to the fact that none of these six sites has the typical Kozak consensus sequences, which have been demonstrated to be important for the initiation of translation (20Liang Y. Carr L.G. Brain Res. 1997; 769: 372-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition to the multiple translation start sites mentioned above, it has been demonstrated that the level of folded RNA structure in the 5′-UTR is also an important element in mRNA translation efficiency (27Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Cell. 1985; 40: 515-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 28Ma C.K. Kolesnikow T. Rayner J.C. Simons E.L. Yim H. Simons R.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 1033-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether the transcript of the 5′-DPRS has a folded RNA structure, which would result in suppression of luciferase reporter gene expression at the translational level. Computer analysis was used to test this possibility and indicated the lack of any stable stem-loop secondary structure in the 34-bpcis-acting element or the rest of the 5′-DPRS of the MOR gene (data not shown). This indirect evidence suggested that the 5′-DPRS inhibits luciferase reporter gene expression at the level of transcription. Results of the S1 nuclease protection assay, in which the level of the pL1.3K/721 transcript was 2-fold that of pL1.3K/444 (Fig. 3), confirm this conclusion. However, it may still be possible that trans-acting factor/DNA interactions between position −687 and position −444, if any, are masking the effect of the 34-bp negative cis-acting element. Additional studies would be required to check this possibility. Taken together, our results are compatible with a model in which these 34 nucleotides function as a transcriptional cis-acting element, although mRNA stability has not been determined and the 2-fold difference in transcript level between pL1.3K/444 and pL1.3K/721 is relatively small. Our study of operational properties of the 34-bp negativecis-acting element in the homologous MOR distal promoter and the heterologous SV40 promoter showed that it is position- and promoter-dependent while being orientation-independent in both promoters (Fig. 5). The varying position effects of the 34-bpcis-acting element in both promoters suggest that it may be conditional regulatory sequences that require an appropriate promoter context for the inhibitory effect on the promoter. The 34-bp cis-acting element is highly homologous between rat, mouse, and human (Fig. 6). Such conservation of these sequences strongly supports the transient transfection results that the 34-bp cis-acting element is functionally important (Fig. 2), since the functional sequences in the 5′-flanking region of genes are generally homologous between species. However, the question remains as to how this negativecis-acting element in the 5′-UTR exerts its inhibitory effect on the distal promoter. Because of its location, one possible explanation for its suppressive activity is that it utilizes an attenuation mechanism similar to that by which eukaryotic RNA polymerase II can terminate transcription around these sequences (29Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 609-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, unless the action of the 34-bp cis-acting element is influenced by the context of DNA, this mechanism is not plausible since the 34-bp cis-acting element is still functionally active upstream of the SV40 promoter (SS-SV40) (Fig.5). Another reasonable explanation is that this region could mediate its inhibitory effect on transcription initiation by atrans-acting factors. Therefore, we were interested in whether the 34-bp cis-acting element contains consensus DNA sequences for some of the known transcription factors. Analysis of this element revealed highly conserved sequences (TTTGAGGAACTA) between −703 and −695 homologous to κE3′ PU-box (5′-TTTGAGGAACTG-3′) of immunoglobulin κ light chain which binds to a nuclear factor PU.1, an Ets family member (30Pongubala J.M.

Although the substitution of those putative PU.1 sequences (Linker 5 and Linker 6) by linker scanning mutation did not show any effect on the distal promoter activity (Fig. 4), it is necessary to determine whether this putative cis-acting element is important for the mouse MOR gene expression. Furthermore, research of the sequences (−741 to −687) on transcription data bases resulted in no findings of any trans-acting factor except PU.1. Currently we are experimenting to identify whether there is a novel trans-acting factor(s) that binds to the 34-bpcis-acting element. In conclusion, we have identified the negative 34-bpcis-acting element which is functional in all cell lines of different tissue origin examined, in a position-dependent and orientation-independent fashion. Future experiments on the regulatory processes that control the inhibitory effect of the 34-bpcis-acting element on the MOR distal promoter will contribute to the elucidation of the mechanism regulating MOR gene expression.

D., Vassarotti, A., Garrett, J., Geller, B. L., Takeda, M., and Douglas, M. G. (1986) J. Cell Biol. 102, 523–533). We show that such fusion proteins interfere with the assembly of respiratory complexes in the mitochondrial inner membrane, without blocking protein translocation. The gene YME1, encoding an ATP-dependent metalloprotease of the mitochondrial inner membrane, acts as a suppressor of this defect; a 3-fold overexpression of Yme1p is sufficient to restore respiratory complex assembly and mitochondrial function. Detailed knowledge of the topology and effect of the toxic β-galactosidase fusion proteins will permit the identification and characterization of components that control protein sorting and protein assembly within the mitochondrial inner membrane.

A classic strategy devised, reviewed by Beckwith and co-workers (2Schatz P.J. Beckwith J.R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 215-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), in characterizing the bacterial protein secretion (sec) machinery involved jamming LacZ fusion proteins into the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. Fusion proteins consisting of a large fragment of MalE fused to the amino terminus of LacZ become lodged in the cytoplasmic membrane, and prolonged induction of the fusion protein leads to a fatal accumulation of natural secretory proteins in wild-type bacterial cells (3Bassford Jr., P.J. Silhavy T.J. Beckwith J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 139: 19-31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The toxic fusion protein provided a tool for selecting bacterial mutants with compromised secretion: somesec mutants are so impaired in fusion protein targeting that the mutant cells survive the induction conditions and grow. TheseEscherichia coli mutants have been used to define several of the components of the bacterial protein secretion machinery: SecA, SecB, SecD, and PrlF (4Oliver D.B. Beckwith J.

Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) to isolate yeast mutants that helped identify components of the transport machinery for protein import into mitochondria (8Douglas M.G.

A toxic LacZ fusion protein, consisting of two-thirds of the F1-ATPase β-subunit fused to the amino terminus of LacZ (F1β-LacZ) 1The abbreviations used are: F1β-LacZ, fusion between two-thirds of the F1-ATPase β-subunit to the amino terminus of β-galactosidase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Su9-DHFR, fusion between two-thirds of subunit 9 of F1F0-ATPase to the amino terminus of dihydrofolate reductase; TOM complex, translocase in the mitochondrial outer membrane; TIM complex, translocase in the mitochondrial inner membrane; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid. was translocated into mitochondria but remained associated with the inner membrane. F1β-LacZ expressed in yeast disrupted mitochondrial function, and cells were respiratory-deficient and unable to grow on the non-fermentable carbon source glycerol (1Emr S.D. Vassarotti A. Garrett J. Geller B.L. Takeda M. Douglas M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Yeast mutants that regained respiration-dependent growth defined four MFT genes (9Garrett J.M. Singh K.K. von der Haar R.A. Emr S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 225: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The first of these MFT genes encodes Mft52p, a cytosolic factor required for accumulation of F1β-LacZ in the mitochondria (9Garrett J.M. Singh K.K. von der Haar R.A. Emr S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 225: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 10Beilharz T. Beddoe T. Landl K. Cartwright P. Lithgow T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5320-5325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Because ATP synthesis is measurably decreased in yeast cells expressing F1β-LacZ, it seemed likely that the growth defect of these cells might be explained by an incorporation of F1β-LacZ into the F1F0-ATPase complex (8Douglas M.G. Geller B.L. Emr S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3983-3987Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Here we show that F1β-LacZ is not integrated into the ATPase complex; F1β-LacZ initiates translocation across the mitochondrial inner membrane but then aborts, and the fusion protein becomes lodged in the intermembrane space. As a result, the assembly of multi-subunit complexes like cytochrome oxidase and the F1F0-ATPase complex is dramatically decreased.YME1, encoding an ATP-dependent metalloprotease, acts as a multicopy suppressor of these defects. The toxic F1β-LacZ fusion protein will be a useful tool to identify and characterize further components of the protein import, sorting, and assembly machineries in the mitochondrial inner membrane. The yeast strain SEY2102 (MATα, ura3, leu2, his4, suc2, gal2) and plasmid CβZ1 were kind gifts from Scott Emr and Jinnie Garrett (1Emr S.D. Vassarotti A. Garrett J. Geller B.L. Takeda M. Douglas M.G.

Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2622) Google Scholar). A fragment of DNA was amplified from the plasmid pRS404, using the oligonucleotide primers 5′-CGA AAA CAG AGA CGT GAT AGA TGA ACG TTT CAA AAA TAC TTG TGT CGC TGT GCG GTA TTT CAC ACC G-3′ and 5′-CGC GCT TGA GCA AAC AAA TCA CGG ATA CGT TTA GCA CCA ACA CCG AGA GAT TGT ACT GAG AGT GCA C-3′, yeast transformants were selected on medium lacking tryptophan, and replacement of the first 1000 base pairs of the YME1 open reading frame was checked by Southern blotting. To construct the plasmids YEpβZ and YCpβZ, the DNA fragment encoding the F1β-LacZ fusion was excised from CβZ1 with EcoRI and SalI and cloned into YEplac181 or YCplac111, respectively. To truncate the coding sequence of F1β, the plasmid CβZ1 was digested withBamHI and treated with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. A blunt-ended fragment of DNA was cloned into this site to truncate the coding sequence of F1β with the amino acid sequence QFELARGFI(stop). Yeast cells transformed with this plasmid (pCβstop) grow at wild-type rates on glycerol-containing medium. The plasmid pPT48 carrying the YME1 gene under the control of the GAL promoter was a kind gift from Peter Thorness (13Thorsness P.E. White K.H. Fox T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5418-5426Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Yeast transformations were according to Gietz et al.(14Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar). Although SEY2102 cells expressing the F1β-LacZ fusion protein fail to grow on glycerol, they can be forced to grow on synthetic medium with lactate as a carbon source (data not shown). 2T. Beilharz and T. Lithgow, unpublished data. Yeast mitochondria were prepared from cells grown on lactate-containing medium, stored frozen, and used in trypsin-accessibility assays and assays for import of 35S-labeled precursors as described previously (15Glick B.S. Brandt A. Cunningham K. Müller S. Hallberg R.L. Schatz G. Cell. 1992; 69: 809-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). An Immobilon P membrane (Millipore) was prewet in methanol and soaked in transfer buffer (10 mmCAPS, 10% methanol, pH 11.0). Mitochondrial proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon P membrane. The membranes were then stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R in 50% methanol, 7% acetic acid for 2 min and destained with 50% methanol, and the bands of interest were excised. The slivers of membrane were inserted into the sequencing cartridge of the HPG1005A protein sequenator and analyzed by Edman degradation. Published methods were used for SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting, preparation of mitoplasts by osmotic shock (15Glick B.S. Brandt A. Cunningham K. Müller S. Hallberg R.L. Schatz G. Cell. 1992; 69: 809-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), extraction of membranes with sodium carbonate (16Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar), and blue native PAGE (17Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1909) Google Scholar). Initial characterization of yeast cells expressing F1β-LacZ demonstrated a respiratory-dependent growth defect and a tight association of the fusion protein with the inner mitochondrial membrane; suggesting that F1β-LacZ might be integrated into the mitochondrial F1F0-ATPase or the TIM23/17 (Translocase in the InnerMitochondrial membrane) complex (8Douglas M.G. Geller B.L. Emr S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3983-3987Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, this appears not to be the case. Mitochondria were prepared from either wild-type yeast cells or from cells transformed to express and accumulate F1β-LacZ (Fig.1 A, lane 2, see also Fig. 3). The subunit stoichiometry of the F1 portion of the F1F0-ATPase was not perturbed as judged by immunoblotting with antibodies recognizing the α, β, and γ subunits (Fig. 1 B), and the rate of import of the model precursor protein Su9-DHFR, which is translocated through the TIM23/17 channel into the matrix, is virtually identical in mitochondria carrying the fusion protein as compared with control mitochondria (Fig.1 C).Figure 3F1β-LacZ accumulates in the intermembrane space of yeast mitochondria. A, mitochondria were isolated from control cells (wild-type) or from cells transformed with the plasmid CβZ1 (+F1β-LacZ) and incubated in isotonic buffer (lanes 1and 4) or in isotonic buffer + 100 μg/ml trypsin (lanes 2 and 5) or in hypotonic buffer + 100 μg/ml trypsin (lanes 3 and6). As a control, a replicate of the sample in lane 5 was incubated with the addition of 0.5% Triton X-100 (lane 7). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antisera to the β-subunit of the F1F0-ATPase (F1β-LacZ) or α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KDH). B, mitochondria were isolated from cells transformed with the plasmid CβZ1 and incubated for 30 min on ice in 10 mm HEPES, 0.08 msorbitol, pH 7.4 (osmotic shock), or in 100 mm sodium carbonate (alkali). After the incubation, mitochondrial membranes were recovered by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the pellet (P) and supernatant (S) fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antisera to the β-subunit of the F1F0-ATPase (F1β-LacZ extracted), cytochrome b 2(cytb2-extracted). The proportion of each protein extracted was quantitated by densitometry of the autoradiograms.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Although similar levels of F1α, F1β, and F1γ subunits were present in control mitochondria as compared with mitochondria carrying F1β-LacZ (Fig. 1 B), we checked the proportion of the F1α, β, and γ subunits assembled into the F1F0-ATPase. Mitochondria were solubilized in non-ionic detergent and subjected to Blue native PAGE (Fig. 2, top panel). The presence of F1β-LacZ decreased the level of fully assembled F1F0-ATPase (Fig. 2, top panel). Similarly, the presence of F1β-LacZ led to a reduction in fully assembled cytochrome c oxidase complex (complex IV). Analyzed by SDS-PAGE, similar levels of both F1β and Cox2p subunits are present in each mitochondrial sample (Fig. 2, bottom panel). The i-AAA complex, an integral complex in the mitochondrial inner membrane containing the AAA-protein Yme1p (18Arlt H. Tauer R. Feldmann H. Neupert W. Langer T. Cell. 1996; 85: 875-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), serves as a useful internal control for loading of Blue native PAGE, as the level of i-AAA complex was unaffected in mitochondria carrying F1β-LacZ (Fig.2). The reduced levels of assembled F1F0-ATPase and cytochrome oxidase explains the original findings of Douglas et al. (8Douglas M.G. Geller B.L. Emr S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3983-3987Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) that while the 32Pi-ATP exchange activity measured in mitochondria carrying F1β-LacZ was less than 10% of that of wild-type mitochondria, the oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity was unaffected. Taken together, production of F1β-LacZ does not disrupt the function of the ATP synthase per se, but it interferes with the assembly or stability of electron transport chain complexes and the assembly of the F1-ATPase onto the F0 stalk, indirectly affecting the capability of the mitochondrial ATP synthase. To determine precisely where the fusion protein does accumulate, mitochondria were isolated from yeast cells expressing F1β-LacZ. Although the fusion protein was not accessible to trypsin in intact mitochondria (Fig.3 A, lane 5), it was accessible when the outer membrane was ruptured by osmotic shock, allowing access of trypsin to the intermembrane space (lane 6). The mitochondrial inner membrane remained intact under these conditions, as shown by the protection of the matrix-located α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Only if the inner membrane is breached with Triton X-100 are matrix-located proteins like α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase degraded by trypsin (lane 7). While present in the intermembrane space, F1β-LacZ was not freely soluble. After osmotic shock and reisolation of the resultant mitoplasts by centrifugation, cytochromeb 2, a soluble protein in the intermembrane space, was released into the supernatant. However, extraction of F1β-LacZ required treatment with sodium carbonate (Fig.3 B, alkali), suggesting that the fusion protein was associated peripherally with a membrane surface within the intermembrane space. Since the fusion has been shown to cofractionate with inner membrane vesicles and not outer membrane vesicles (1Emr S.D. Vassarotti A. Garrett J. Geller B.L. Takeda M. Douglas M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), F1β-LacZ must be peripherally bound to the outer surface of the inner membrane. The genuine F1β precursor is synthesized in the cytosol with a presequence (19Maccecchini M. Rudin Y. Blobel G. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), necessary and sufficient to deliver passenger proteins into the mitochondrial matrix (1Emr S.D. Vassarotti A. Garrett J. Geller B.L. Takeda M. Douglas M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Localization of F1β-LacZ to the intermembrane space might be caused by its retention within the inner membrane or by its aborted translocation across the membrane. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we sequenced the amino terminus of the fusion protein and found that the entire presequence had been precisely trimmed. The amino-terminal sequence of F1β-LacZ, A34SAAQSTPITGKVTA48 corresponded to the amino-terminal sequence of F1β purified from bovine mitochondria (20Walker J.E. Fearnley I.M. Gay N.J. Gibson B.W. Northrop F.D. Powell S.J. Runswick M.J. Saraste M. Tybulewicz V.L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 184: 677-701Crossref Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Therefore, like genuine F1β, the amino terminus of F1β-LacZ seems to have been translocated across the mitochondrial inner membrane, and its presequence processed by the matrix-located processing peptidase. However, translocation of F1β-LacZ was not complete, and the mature protein remained in the intermembrane space. The assembly of protein subunits encoded from the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes may depend on a set of ATP-dependent proteases located within the mitochondrial inner membrane. These proteases possess a chaperone-like function that can be utilized in the degradation as well as the assembly of mitochondrial proteins (21Suzuki C.K. Rep M. van Dijl J.M. Suda K. Grivell L.A. Schatz G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 118-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Yeast mitochondria have at least three members present in the mitochondrial inner membrane: Afg3p/Yta10p, Rca1p/Yta12p, and Yme1p (14Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4218-4229Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Only Yme1p is oriented with its ATPase and protease sites in the intermembrane space (26Leonhard K. Herrmann J.M. Stuart R.A. Mannhaupt G. Neupert W. Langer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4218-4229Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), and overexpression of the F1β-LacZ fusion protein yields a phenotype reminiscent of the loss-of-function phenotypes of Δyme1 mutants. First, both Δyme1 mutants and wild-type cells overexpressing F1β-LacZ show loss of growth on glycerol as a carbon source. Second, both are cold-sensitive for growth on glucose media (Ref. 13Thorsness P.E. White K.H. Fox T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5418-5426Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar; data not shown).2Third, like wild-type cells overexpressing F1β-LacZ, yeast mutants lacking Yme1p show diminished assembly of Cox2p into the cytochrome oxidase complex.2 Might the F1β-LacZ fusion protein exert its toxic effect by titrating the function of Yme1p in the intermembrane space? Overexpression of YME1 relieves the phenotype of cells expressing the F1β-LacZ fusion protein, allowing the cells to grow at near wild-type rates on media with glycerol as the carbon source (Fig. 4 A). Overexpression of the related genes RCA1 or AFG3did not restore growth on media with glycerol as a carbon source. In the absence of the fusion protein, levels of Yme1p are tightly regulated, so overexpression of YME1 does not lead to an increase in the steady-state level of Yme1p in control mitochondria (Ref. 13Thorsness P.E. White K.H. Fox T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5418-5426Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar; data not shown).2 However, overexpression ofYME1 in cells carrying F1β-LacZ fusion protein leads to a 3-fold increase in the steady-state level of Yme1p (Fig.4 B, lane 3). There are three possible mechanisms by which overexpression of Yme1p might relieve the mitochondrial defects of yeast cells carrying F1β-LacZ. First, F1β-LacZ might be degraded as a result of increased proteolysis mediated by Yme1p. Second, F1β-LacZ might be forced across the inner membrane into the matrix of the mitochondria in a Yme1p-dependent manner. Third, F1β-LacZ might be maintained in the intermembrane space by a chaperone-like activity of Yme1p. We found that overexpression of YME1 did not lead to degradation of F1β-LacZ (Fig. 4 B, lane 3), rather the fusion protein remained in the intermembrane space, accessible to exogenously added trypsin when the mitochondrial outer membrane was ruptured by osmotic shock.2 Without affecting the relative levels of F1β and F1β-LacZ (Fig. 4 C, lanes 2 and 3), the increased level of Yme1p is sufficient to compliment the assembly of β-subunits into the F1F0-ATPase complex (Fig. 4 C, bottom panel) or Cox2p into cytochrome oxidase.2 The F1β-LacZ fusion protein has been previously shown to remain associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane (1Emr S.D. Vassarotti A. Garrett J. Geller B.L. Takeda M. Douglas M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that F1β-LacZ can complete translocation through the TOM complex in the outer membrane; however, it fails to complete translocation across the inner membrane. The amino terminus of the F1β-LacZ precursor is translocated far enough into the mitochondrial matrix to be processed correctly by the matrix-located processing peptidase. F1β-LacZ initiates translocation but is not completely transported into the matrix. Instead F1β-LacZ is retained in the intermembrane space where it interferes with the assembly of inner membrane complexes involved in respiration and ATP synthesis. Why does this large F1β-LacZ fusion protein fail to be completely translocated across the inner mitochondrial membrane? Emr et al. (1Emr S.D. Vassarotti A. Garrett J. Geller B.L. Takeda M. Douglas M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) previously showed that the toxicity of F1β-LacZ is not because of β-galactosidase; an F1β-invertase fusion protein also stops growth of yeast cells on glycerol-containing medium. From the crystal structure of the F1-ATPase, the region of F1β included in the toxic fusion proteins corresponds fortuitously but precisely to the first two domains of the β-subunit containing the ATPase (28Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2753) Google Scholar). We wondered if expression of this fragment of F1β might represent a toxic ATPase. However, truncation of F1β by introducing an in-frame stop codon between the F1β and LacZ sequences in the plasmid CβZ1 leads to the expression of a fragment of F1β that is not toxic and that is rapidly degraded within the mitochondria2 (see “Experimental Procedures”). We suggest that some property of the fusion junction might lead to an irreversible protein conformation responsible for aborting translocation across the inner membrane. More detailed experiments are required to address this point. Yme1p belongs to the AAA family of ATPasesAssociated with diverse cellular Activities. A bacterial homolog, FtsH, has been extensively characterized by Ito and coworkers (27Akiyama Y. Ogura T. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5218-5224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FtsH is an ATP-dependent metalloprotease anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane where it performs two functions: it degrades incompletely assembled membrane proteins, and it influences the recognition of the stop-transfer sequences of translocating polypeptides. In ftsH mutant cells, some proteins fail to be translocated into the periplasm, and overexpression of FtsHleads to aberrant translocation of some integral proteins across the membrane (27Akiyama Y. Ogura T. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5218-5224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like FtsH, Yme1p is also an ATP-dependent metalloprotease that is responsible for the degradation of unassembled Cox2 subunits (23Tzagaloff A. Yue J. Jang J. Paul M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26144-26151PubMed Google Scholar, 26Leonhard K. Herrmann J.M. Stuart R.A. Mannhaupt G. Neupert W. Langer T.

Hanekamp T. Thorsness P.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and Δyme1 cells have defects in the assembly of cytochrome oxidase.2 We have found that overexpression of Yme1p suppresses the defects of yeast cells expressing F1β-LacZ. The ability of Yme1p to overcome the toxic effects of F1β-LacZ expression is not because of increased degradation of the fusion protein nor by promoting translocation of F1β-LacZ across the inner membrane. Rather, overproduction of Yme1p promotes the assembly of inner membrane protein complexes in mitochondria carrying the fusion protein. We propose that F1β-LacZ titrates the available Yme1p. In wild-type yeast cells, expression of Yme1p is tightly regulated: overexpression of the YME1 gene does not lead to increased levels of Yme1p (13Thorsness P.E. White K.H. Fox T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5418-5426Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We have found, however, that in the presence of the artificial substrate F1β-LacZ, levels of Yme1p can be increased 3-fold by overexpression of YME1, which is sufficient to restore mitochondrial function. By analogy with FtsH, Yme1p might be directly involved in the translocation arrest and release of F1β-LacZ. Certainly, one component of the translocation machinery is determining that the fusion protein should be released in the intermembrane space. F1β-LacZ will be a useful substrate to test the involvement of Yme1p and other components in the translocation of precursor proteins across the inner mitochondrial membrane. It is possible that other genes encoding putative chaperones could also function as multicopy suppressors of the defects of yeast cells in which F1β-LacZ is jammed in the intermembrane space. In addition, components of the translocation machinery might contribute to toxicity because F1β-LacZ fails to be sorted into the matrix. If so, conditional yeast mutants, akin to those described fromEscherichia coli, might define the sorting machinery in the inner membrane. By analogy with its success in terms of defining the bacterial sec machinery, our understanding of how F1β-LacZ fusion proteins work provides an important tool for characterizing in molecular detail the protein sorting and assembly machinery within the mitochondrial inner membrane. We thank Scott Emr, in whose lab the F1β-LacZ system was developed, for generosity with reagents and encouragement to continue this investigation.

Thus, the relative expression of various SR proteins may play an important role in alternative splicing regulation. HRS/SRp40, an SR protein and delayed early gene in liver regeneration, can mediate alternative splicing of fibronectin mRNA. Here we determined that transcription of the HRS/SRp40 gene is induced about 5-fold during liver regeneration, similar to the level of steady-state mRNA. We found that both mouse and human HRS promoters lack TATA and CAAT boxes. The mouse promoter region from −130 to −18, which contains highly conserved GA-binding protein (GABP) and YY1 binding sites, conferred high transcriptional activity. While GABPα/GABPβ heterodimer transactivated the HRS promoter, YY1 functioned as a repressor. During liver regeneration, the relative amount of GABPα/GABPβ heterodimer increased 3-fold, and YY1 changed little, which could partially account for the increase in HRS gene transcription. Interleukin-6, a critical mitogenic component of liver regeneration, was able to relieve the repressive activity of the YY1 site within the HRS promoter. The combined effect of small changes in the level of existing transcription factors and mitogenic signals may explain the transcriptional activation of theHRS gene during cell growth.

At present, eight SR proteins have been identified and characterized (2Manley J.L. Tacke R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). All of these proteins share two common characteristics: one or two RNA binding domains at the amino terminus and one Arg-Ser-rich domain at the carboxyl terminus. As alternative splicing regulators, SR proteins have been shown to regulate various forms of alternative splicing including exon inclusion, alternative 5′ splicing site selection, and alternative 3′ splicing site selection in both in vitro and in vivo assays (3Chabot B.

In our initial studies of hepatic growth, we isolated theHRS/SRp40 (hereafter referred to as HRS) cDNA, which encodes an SR protein and is a highly induced immediate early gene in insulin-treated rat hepatoma H35 cells (14Diamond R.H. Du K. Lee V.M. Mohn K.L. Haber B.A. Tewari D.S. Taub R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15185-15192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).HRS mRNA is induced as a delayed early gene during liver regeneration with peak expression in rat liver at 6–8 h and approximately 5-fold induction (14Diamond R.H. Du K. Lee V.M. Mohn K.L. Haber B.A. Tewari D.S. Taub R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15185-15192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, HRSmRNA expression is high in developing liver, especially prior to birth, when it is elevated 100-fold relative to normal adult liver (15Du K. Yong P. Greenbaum L.E. Haber B.A. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4096-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We showed that HRS expression correlates with the expression of EIIIB+ fibronectin pre-mRNA in proliferating liver. HRS can directly bind to a purine-rich enhancer in the fibronectin EIIIB exon and mediate fibronectin EIIIB exon inclusion in in vivosplicing assays (15Du K. Yong P. Greenbaum L.E. Haber B.A. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4096-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Changes in the level of fibronectin isoforms could play a critical role in reorganizing liver architecture during liver regeneration and development. Distinct patterns of SR protein expression during development, cell differentiation, and cell proliferation determine alternative splicing decisions (15Du K. Yong P. Greenbaum L.E. Haber B.A. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4096-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 16Screaton G.R. Caceres J.F. Mayeda A. Bell M.V. Plebanski M. Jackson D.G. Bell J.I. Krainer A.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4336-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The expression of SR genes has been shown to be regulated at the transcriptional level (1Fu X.D. RNA. 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kramer A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 367-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of SR genes remains largely unknown. To understand how HRS gene expression is regulated, we analyzed the mouse HRS promoter. We found that the region from −130 to −18 of the HRS promoter contained high promoter activity in HepG2 cells. We further demonstrated that GABPα/GABPβ heterodimer and YY1 regulate HRS gene expression positively and negatively, respectively. Whereas the level of YY1 changes little during liver regeneration, the relative level of GABPα/β heterodimer increases. Interleukin-6, which confers a positive growth stimulus in liver regeneration (18Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E. DeAngelis R.A. Ciliberto G. Furth E.E. Poli V. Taub R. Science. 1996; 274: 1379-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar), can relieve YY1 repression. The combination of these effects provides a potential mechanism forHRS gene induction during liver regeneration. For regenerating liver, female Fisher rats (160–220 g, Charles River) or normal C57Bl6 mice were metofane (Pitman-Moore, Inc.)-anesthetized and subjected to midventral laparotomy with approximately 70% liver (left lateral and median lobes) (19Higgins G.M. Anderson R.M. Arch. Pathol. 1931; 12: 186-202Google Scholar). Human hepatoma HepG2 and mouse fibroblast NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine and 100 units of penicillin and 50 units of streptomycin (Life Technologies Inc.). The transient transfection was performed by the calcium phosphate method as described (20Hsu J.C. Bravo R. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4654-4665Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Cells were plated on 60-mm plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/plate and transfected with the indicated amount of reporter plasmids and expression plasmids along with 2 μg of pRSV-β-galactosidase for normalization of transfection efficiency. The DNA precipitate was incubated with the cells overnight (usually 14–16 h). The cells were harvested with 1× Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega), and the luciferase assay was performed on a Luminat luminometer (Wallace Inc.). IL-6 was added at 50 ng/ml for 4 h where indicated. Nuclei were prepared as reported previously (21Greenbaum L.E. Cressman D.E. Haber B.A. Taub R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1351-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Nuclear run-on assays were carried out by following the method described (22Mohn K.L. Melby A.E. Tewari D.S. Laz T.M. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We used β2-microglobulin as a positive control and Bluescript SK(−) as negative control. The RNase protection assay was carried out by using the RPA II kit from Ambion. To prepare the riboprobe, the EcoRI–TthIII fragment, which covers the first exon and putative 700 bp of 5′-flanking sequence, was cloned into the pGEM4 vector, linearized withEcoRI, and in vitro transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase by adding [32P]UTP. The labeled probe was purified on urea-denatured 5% polyacrylamide gel. 2 × 104 cpm was hybridized with 10 μg of total RNA from NIH 3T3 cells. Primer extensions analyses were performed as we have described (23Peng Y. Genin A. Spinner N.B. Diamond R.H. Taub R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17286-17295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) using a primer, 5′-GTAGTCTGCGACGGAGCTGTCTGCCT-3′, from the first exon region of the mouse gene and mouse regenerating liver RNA. The total liver nuclei were prepared as described (15Du K. Yong P. Greenbaum L.E. Haber B.A. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4096-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, the liver nuclei were resuspended in 1× SDS/sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 0.1% SDS, 72 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol, without bromphenol blue). The protein concentration was determined byA 280. For immunoblots, 10 μg of total nuclear proteins in each lane were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with 1:1000 diluted antibodies. Horse rabbit peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin secondary antibody and a chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Corp.) were used. To clone the mouse HRSpromoter into pGL2-basic, the 1.5-kb fragment between −1.5 kb and +100 bp was amplified by PCR with primer 5′- CGGCTGAGATCTGGAGAGGTCCG-3 and Sp6 primer from pG7–6 (24Du K. Taub R. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 204: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The amplified fragment was filled in with T4 DNA polymerase and digested with BglII. The resulting DNA fragment was cloned into pGL2-basic between the BglII andNheI (blunted) sites. To construct pGL-0.4 and -0.8, the amplified fragment was digested with BglII andNheI or digested with EcoRI first and then filled in and digested with BglII. To construct pGL-r0.8, theBglII/EcoRI-blunted fragment was ligated into pGL2-basic BglII/HindIII-blunted sites. To construct pGEM-0.8, the amplified fragment was digested withEcoRI and BglII and cloned into theEcoRI and BamHI sites of pGEM4. The plasmid pGL-5.3 was constructed as follows. Mouse genomic DNA from theHRS gene phage clone was digested with EcoRI. The 5′-flanking 4.6-kb EcoRI fragment was cloned into pGEM4. The 5′ EcoRI site was then blunted, and the resulting bluntedEcoRI fragment was cloned into the KpnI (blunted) and EcoRI site in pGL-1.5. To construct pGL-2.7, pGL-5.3 was digested with SmaI and KpnI, and theKpnI site was blunted. Then the resulting 8.7-kb fragment was religated. Further deletions of pGL-0.4 were made using Bal-31 nuclease. SstI-linearized pGL-0.4 was incubated with Bal-31 nuclease at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped at 3-min intervals and then digested with BglII. The resulting DNA fragments were separated on an 8% native polyacrylamide gel, and DNA fragments were eluted into 0.5 m NH4Ac and 1 mmEDTA. After ethanol precipitation, the deletion fragments were cloned into pGL-basic between BlgII and NheI (blunted) sites. Site-directed mutagenesis at GABP and YY1 sites was also performed by overlapping extension PCR. All of the mutations were made in pGL-0.1 (Fig. 2). The oligonucleotides were as follows: for mutating the YY1 site, mYY1 (5′-AGGACGTCCTTAAATTTTGTGCAACG-3′) and mYY2 (5′-ACGTTGCACAAAATTTAAGGACGTCC-3′); for mutating the GABP site, GA-M1 (5′- ACCGCCCTGCAGTGACGCCAGG-3′) and GA-M2 (5′-TCCTGGCGTCACTGCAGGGCGG-3′); and constant primers, HRSBgl (5′-CGGCTGAGATCTGGAGAGGTCCG-3′) and pGLp1 (5′-TGTATCTTATGGTACTGGTACTGTAACTG-3′). pGL-0.1 was first amplified with primers mYY1/HRSBgl or mYY2/pGLp1 and GA-M1/HRS40Bgl or GA-M2/pGLp1. The resultant PCR products were purified and mixed and further amplified with pGLp1 and HRSBgl. The final PCR products were digested with MluI–BglII and cloned into pGL-basic between MluI and BglII sites. All of the mutations were verified by DNA sequence analysis. HepG2 cells were grown as described above, and about 1–2 × 108 cells were used to prepare nuclear extract exactly as described by Kramer (25Kramer A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 215-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Briefly, HepG2 cells were collected in 25 ml of cold PBS and pelleted. After washing with 1 ml of buffer A (10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol), the cells were resuspended into 0.5 ml of buffer A. The cells were lysed with a 1-ml syringe with a 25-gauge × 58-inch hypodermic needle. The nuclei were resuspended into 0.2 ml of buffer C (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepsin). The nuclear extracts were dialyzed against 400 ml of buffer D (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 0.1m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol). The liver nuclear extract was prepared as reported (18Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E. DeAngelis R.A. Ciliberto G. Furth E.E. Poli V. Taub R. Science. 1996; 274: 1379-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). Briefly, the liver nuclei were suspended into 0.5 ml of buffer C, and the nuclear extracts were dialyzed against buffer D. The protein concentration of nuclear extracts was determined by a method from Bio-Rad. The nuclear extract was divided into 50-μl aliquots and then stored at −80 °C. EMSAs were performed with nuclear extract from HepG2 cells or rat liver (26Cressman D.E. Taub R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26594-26597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Typically, 5 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 104 cpm of labeled probe in 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 12% glycerol, 4 mm Tris, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol in a 20-μl volume at room temperature for 20 min. For competition experiments, a 50-fold excess of cold oligonucleotides was added to the reaction mixture. For supershift, 1 μl of the indicated antibodies were added to the reaction mixture. The DNA-protein complex was separated on 5% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE at 4 °C. Anti-YY1 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-GABPα and GABPβ antibodies were gifts from Steven McKnight (University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas, TX). The sequences of double-stranded oligonucleotides were as follows: wild type YY1, 5′-AGGACGTCCTTCCATTTTGTGCAACG-3′; mutant YY1, 5′-AGGACGTCCTTAAATTTTGTGCAACG-3′; wild type GABP, 5′-ACCGCCCCGGAAGTGACGCCAGG-3′; mutant GABP, 5′-ACCGCCAACGAAGTGACGCCAGG-3′. The oligonucleotides were synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. The two complementary oligonucleotides were annealed and purified through 12% native polyacrylamide gel and then labeled with 32P by T4 nucleotide kinase. HRSmRNA is induced during liver regeneration with peak expression at 6–8 h in rat liver and approximately 5-fold induction (14Diamond R.H. Du K. Lee V.M. Mohn K.L. Haber B.A. Tewari D.S. Taub R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15185-15192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Du K. Yong P. Greenbaum L.E. Haber B.A. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4096-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Since RNA abundance may be controlled by both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms, the transcriptional activity of theHRS gene was assessed using nuclear run-on assays (Fig.1). Transcription of HRS was increased at 2 and 6 h posthepatectomy (about 5-fold) and not increased at 30 min, consistent with the delayed early induction ofHRS (14Diamond R.H. Du K. Lee V.M. Mohn K.L. Haber B.A. Tewari D.S. Taub R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15185-15192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a control, the transcription of β2-microglobulin did not change appreciably during this time period, whereas that of the IGFBP-1 gene, an immediate early gene in liver regeneration, was increased about 14-fold at 30 min, consistent with earlier studies (22Mohn K.L. Melby A.E. Tewari D.S. Laz T.M. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). RNase protection and primer extension assays were used to map the transcription initiation site of the mouse HRS gene (Fig.2 A), which is indicated as +1 (Fig. 2 B). We sequenced a 1.5-kb upstream region of the predicted transcription initiation site in both the human and mouseHRS genes (GenBankTM accession numbers areAF020307 (human HRS gene) and AF020308 (mouse HRSgene)). Based on the location of the RNA initiation site, neither human nor mouse HRS promoters appear to contain TATA or CAAT boxes. With extensive alignment analysis between the human and mouseHRS genes, two regions of strong homology were found upstream of the RNA initiation site and not in more 5′ upstream regions (Fig. 2 B). Two regions of identity contained a putative YY1 binding site (27Seto E. Shi Y. Shenk T. Nature. 1991; 354: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and an EFT4 or GABP binding site (28Watanabe H. Sawada J. Yano K. Yamaguchi K. Goto M. Handa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1385-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 29LaMarco K. Thompson C.C. Byers B.P. Walton E.M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 253: 789-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Additionally, there were two identical regions between −18 and +44, and there are putative GABP and Sp1 sites in the mouse promoter that were incompletely conserved in the human gene. We chose HepG2 cells to further analyze the transcriptional control of theHRS gene, because HRS is highly expressed in HepG2 cells, and HepG2 cells represent a fetal liver phenotype (Fig.3 A). To test the ability of the predicted region to function as a promoter, we first cloned the 0.7 kb of 5′-flanking sequence of the HRS gene which included part of the first exon into a pGL2-basic luciferase reporter vector in both sense and antisense orientations (Fig. 3 B). As shown (Fig. 3 B), only sense pGL-0.8kb showed high luciferase activity, indicating that this region contains the HRSpromoter and that the HRS promoter is orientation-dependent (comparing pGL-0.8 and pGL-r0.8). To further examine HRS promoter activity, we cloned up to 5 kb of 5′-flanking sequence and performed a series of deletion mutations. There was no significant change in promoter activity when the deletion extended from −5.3 kb to −130 bp, suggesting that there are no major regulatory element(s) in this region, at least in HepG2 cells. When the deletion was extended to −60 bp, the promoter activity dropped about 2.5-fold, which could be explained by loss of the upstream antisense GABP site and predicted Sp1 site (see Fig. 2 B). Further deletion (to −56 bp) virtually abolished HRS promoter activity. These data predict that the sequences between −130 and −18 bp of the HRS promoter contain critical regulatory element(s), consistent with the high sequence homology of this region. Using these deletion constructs in transiently transfected mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, similar results were obtained, implying that this regulation was not limited to liver cells (data not shown). The −130/+100 promoter construct (pGL-0.1) exhibited significant promoter activity in transfected cells. Sequence analysis revealed conserved YY1 and GABP binding sites in this region of the HRS promoter. We analyzed these two binding sites in further detail. YY1 is a zinc finger transcription factor that was initially identified as a transcriptional repressor of the P5 promoter. YY1-mediated repression can be converted to activation in the presence of adenoviral protein E1A (30Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.S. Shenk T.

Virol. 1995; 69: 1628-1636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Depending on the promoter context and cell type, YY1 can be either a transcriptional activator or repressor (33Bauknecht T. Jundt F. Herr I. Oehler T. Delius H. Shi Y. Angel P. Zur Hausen H. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Bauknecht T. Angel P. Royer H.D. zur Hausen H.

To test how YY1 regulates the HRS promoter, the YY1 binding site was mutated, with the CC changed into AA (Fig.4 A). Previous studies of the P5 promoter showed that this mutation abolishes YY1 regulatory activity (27Seto E. Shi Y. Shenk T. Nature. 1991; 354: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). This mutation increased HRS promoter activity about 3-fold, suggesting that the YY1 site confers transcriptional repression of the HRS promoter in HepG2 cells. Again, this effect was not cell type-specific in that the YY1 mutation increased reporter activity by about 10-fold in transfected NIH 3T3 cells (not shown). To confirm that HepG2 nuclear extracts contain YY1, which is able to interact with the predicted YY1 binding site in the HRSpromoter, we carried out EMSAs using HepG2 cell nuclear extracts and an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the YY1 binding site in theHRS promoter. One specific DNA-protein binding complex was detected (Fig. 4 B, lane 2). This complex could be competed off by excess cold wild type probe but not by mutant oligonucleotides (lanes 3 and4). Anti-YY1 antibody, not anti-Sp1 antibody, partly supershifted but primarily disrupted this band (lanes 5 and 6). Taken together, these data suggested that YY1 specifically binds to the YY1 binding site in theHRS promoter and functions as a transcriptional repressor. To further demonstrate the repression of the HRS promoter by YY1 in HepG2 cells, we cotransfected the HRS promoter construct (pGL-0.1) with a pCMV-YY1 expression plasmid to determine whether overexpression of YY1 can further repress the HRSpromoter. Overexpression of YY1 efficiently repressed theHRS promoter construct (Fig. 4 C). As a control, overexpression of YY1 did not affect pGL2-basic or pGL2-promoter luciferase activity. Furthermore, YY1-mediated repression was dependent on the presence of an intact YY1 binding site, because the activity of the pGL-0.1mYY1 reporter was not affected by cotransfection with pCMV-YY1. Since E1A can transform YY1 from a transcriptional repressor to an activator, we predicted that overexpression of E1A would activate the HRS promoter. As shown (Fig. 4 D), overexpression of E1A activated the HRS promoter about 5-fold, and activation of the HRS promoter by E1A was abolished when the YY1 binding site was mutated. As a control, E1A did not affect pGL2-basic and pGL2-promoter luciferase activity. All of these data are consistent with the finding that YY1 functions as a repressor of the HRS promoter. GABP is an ETS transcription factor initially isolated as a transcription factor that recognizes a site important for herpes simplex virus type I immediate early gene activation. GABP is composed of two subunits: α and β (36Thompson C.C. Brown T.A. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 253: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 37Brown T.A. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2502-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). GABPα, which contains the DNA binding domain, interacts with GABPβ to form an active heterodimer (36Thompson C.C. Brown T.A.

Initial deletion mutation studies showed that deleting part of the putative GABP binding site dramatically decreased HRSpromoter activity (Fig. 3). To test the possible role of GABP inHRS promoter activity, we mutated the GABP binding site in the HRS promoter in plasmid pGL-0.1 and examined how this mutation affected HRS promoter activity in HepG2 cells. As shown (Fig. 5 A), this mutation decreased basal HRS promoter activity by about 15-fold. To examine whether GABP from HepG2 nuclear extract bound to the predicted GABP site in the HRS promoter, EMSAs were performed with an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the HRS GABP binding site (Fig. 5 B). A major retarded band was detected (lane 2). This band could be competed off by wild type but not mutant oligonucleotides. In EMSA experiments performed with antibodies specific to GABPα and -β as well as anti-Sp1 antibody, only anti-GABPα and -GABPβ antibodies (lanes 5 and 6) disrupted the DNA binding complex. These data indicated that GABP bound to the site as a heterodimer. Together pCMV-GABPα and -β activated the HRS promoter up to 5-fold. GABPα alone slightly inhibited HRS promoter activity, and GABPβ alone slightly activated the HRSpromoter (Fig. 5 C). These data are consistent with the previous finding that GABPα and -β synergistically activate gene expression (38Genuario R.R. Perry R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4388-4395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The fact that GABPα alone slightly inhibited theHRS promoter while GABPβ alone slightly activated theHRS promoter suggested that there is a limiting amount of GABPβ in HepG2 cells. HRS is induced as a delayed early gene with approximately 5-fold transcriptional induction during liver regeneration (Fig. 1). Since both GABP and YY1 regulate HRSgene expression, we wondered whether there were changes in GABP or YY1 levels during liver regeneration that might explain the increase inHRS gene transcription. We did not detect any change in the overall binding activity or the level of YY1 protein (Fig.6, A and B). Of note, a smaller YY1 DNA binding complex was detected in EMSAs (ΔYY1), and a 23-kDa peptide was detected in immunoblots of regenerating liver nuclear extracts (data not shown). The ΔYY1 DNA binding complex is probably an experimental artifact, since inconsistent results were obtained from different regenerating nuclear extracts (data not shown), and a single undegraded YY1 peptide was detected in an immunoblot of total liver nuclear protein that had been immediately suspended in SDS loading buffer (Fig. 6 B). Two DNA binding complexes were detected in liver nuclear extracts when the GABP binding site was used as a probe (Fig. 6 C). These two complexes corresponded to the GABPα/β heterodimer and GABPα monomer (α:β and α in Fig. 6 C), because both complexes were competed off by wild type oligonucleotides and the lower band supershifted only with anti-GABPα antibody (lanes 2 and 3 in Fig. 6 C). The GABPα monomer band decreased during liver regeneration by about 3-fold. An immunoblot of nuclear proteins from regenerating liver was probed with a mixture of anti-GABPα and GABPβ antibodies (Fig. 6 D) indicated that an increase in the level of GABPβ by 3–8 h posthepatectomy could explain the relative increase in the GABPα/β heterodimer. As predicted by Fig. 5 C, an increase in the ratio of GABPα/β heterodimer to GABPα homodimer could explain at least some of the transcriptional up-regulation of the HRSgene. Like E1A, C/EBPβ may transform YY1 from a dominant repressor into a transcriptional activator"

CBG also catalyzes a variety of transglycosylation reactions, which have been been shown with other glycosylhydrolases to function in synthetic and genetic regulatory pathways. We investigated the catalytic mechanism, substrate specificity, and transglycosylation acceptor specificity of guinea pig liver CBG by several methods. These studies indicate that CBG employs a two-step catalytic mechanism with the formation of a covalent enzyme-sugar intermediate and that CBG will transfer sugar residues to primary hydroxyls and equatorial but not axial C-4 hydroxyls of aldopyranosyl sugars. Kinetic studies revealed that correction for transglycosylation reactions is necessary to derive correct kinetic parameters for CBG. Further analyses revealed that for aldopyranosyl substrates, the activation energy barrier is affected most by the presence of a C-6 carbon and by the configuration of the C-2 hydroxyl, whereas the binding energy is affected modestly by the configuration and substituents at C-2, C-4, and C-5. These data indicate that the transglycosylation activity of CBG derives from the formation of a covalently linked enzyme-sugar intermediate and that the specificity of CBG for transglycosylation reactions is different from its specificity for hydrolysis reactions.

The enzyme hydrolyzes β-d-galactopyranosides, β-d-fucopyranosides, β-d-xylopyranosides, and α-l-arabinopyranosides, in addition to β-d-glucopyranosides (1Glew R.H. Gopalan V. Forsyth G.W. VanderJagt D.J. β-Glucosidases: Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1993: 83-112Google Scholar). The enzyme also catalyzes transglycosylation reactions in which a sugar residue is transferred from a substrate molecule to an acceptor to form a new glycoside (2Gopalan V. VanderJagt D.J. Libell D.P. Glew R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9629-9638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These properties are consistent with the fact that CBG is a configuration-retaining glycosidase (3Legler G. Bieberich E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 260: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest that the catalytic mechanism of CBG consists of a double-displacement reaction involving the formation of a stable enzyme-sugar intermediate, as originally proposed for configuration-retaining glycosidases by Koshland (4Koshland D.E. Biol. Rev. Cambr. Philos. Soc. 1953; 28: 416-436Crossref Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Additional evidence of a two-step catalytic mechanism for CBG was derived from studies performed with the inhibitor, Br-conduritol-β-epoxide, which is an irreversible, active site-directed inactivator of the enzyme (5Legler G. Bieberich E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 260: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, studies withEscherichia coli β-galactosidase and human glucocerebrosidase have shown that the mechanism of inactivation by related conduritol epoxide compounds differs from the catalytic mechanisms of these two enzymes. For both glucocerebrosidase and β-galactosidase, the amino acid residue identified as the catalytic nucleophile by labeling with conduritol epoxides was later demonstrated to be incorrect by site-directed mutagenesis experiments (6Bader D.E. Ring M. Huber R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 153: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 7Grace M.E. Newman K.M. Scheinker V. Berg-Fussman A. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11126-11130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Miao S. McCarter J.D. Grace M.E. Grabowski G.A. Aebersold R. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10975-10978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) provided true mechanism-based inhibition that correctly identified the catalytic nucleophiles in both E. coli β-galactosidase and glucocerebrosidase, as well as numerous other configuration-retaining glycosidases (reviewed in Ref. 10McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Transglycosylation reactions are intimately involved in the carbohydrate metabolism of numerous species. A large number of well characterized glycosyltransferases catalyze the transfer of sugars from nucleoside-diphosphate intermediates to mono-, oligo-, and polysaccharide acceptor moieties (11Dinter A. Berger E.G. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; 376: 53-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Less widely appreciated is the metabolic significance of transglycosylation reactions catalyzed by glycosyl hydrolases. In plants, xyloglucan endohydrolase-endotransferase has been implicated in the incorporation of xyloglucan oligomers into cell wall polymers in vivoduring remodeling (12Thompson J.E. Smith R.C. Fry S.C. Biochem J. 1997; 327: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In E. coli, expression of thelac operon is regulated by the product of a transglycosylation reaction. Allolactose, the natural inducer of thelac operon, is produced by the transfer of galactose from the 4-OH of the glucose residue of lactose to the 6-OH of glucose to form β-d-galactopyranosyl-(1→6)-β-d-glucopyranoside. The lac Z β-galactosidase catalyzes the formation of allolactose at a constant fraction of the rate of production of the hydrolysis products glucose and galactose (13Jobe A. Bourgeois S. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 69: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The potential significance of similar transglycosylation reactions in mammalian cells is an area of current investigation. The intimate relationship between transglycosylation reactions and the catalytic mechanism of configuration-retaining glycosidases prompted us to analyze the catalytic mechanism of CBG and its acceptor specificity in transglycosylation reactions. In this study, we demonstrate that the catalytic mechanism of CBG involves the formation of a covalent enzyme-sugar intermediate and show that transglycosylation reactions account for a substantial fraction of the catalytic activity at saturating concentrations of substrate. The acceptor specificity of the enzyme in transglycosylation reactions was characterized, and by correcting for transglycosylation reactions in the analysis of a homologous series of substrates, the effects of different sugar epimers on the energies of binding and hydrolysis were quantified. Substrates for β-glucosidase assays, E. coliβ-galactosidase (grade IX, catalog no. G6512),para-nitrophenyl glycosides, 4-methylumbelliferyl glycosides, and all noncovalent inhibitors were purchased from Sigma. The inhibitor, 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-β-d-glucopyranosyl fluoride (2FβGlcF), was a generous gift of Dr. Steven G. Withers of the University of British Columbia. Cytosolic β-glucosidase was purified from guinea pig liver as described elsewhere (14Hays W.S. Jenison S.A. Yamada T. Pastuszyn A.P. Glew R.H. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). β-Glucosidase enzyme assays were performed as described previously (15Gopalan V. Pastuszyn A. Galey W.R. Glew R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14027-14032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All kinetic studies were performed with pure enzyme that had been stored in 50% (v/v) ethylene glycol. Working solutions of enzyme were prepared by removing the ethylene glycol from 1.0-μg aliquots of the stock solution using a Centricon 30 ultrafiltration device. The washed enzyme was reconstituted with 10 mmsodium citrate, pH 6.0, and 1.0 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Aliquots (5–10 μl) were removed from the working solution for individual reactions. Kinetic studies with substrates were performed over a 100-fold concentration range centered on the estimatedK m of the substrate. Seven to 10 concentrations of each substrate were assayed in duplicate, with blanks at each concentration consisting of an equal volume of distilled H2O in lieu of enzyme. All assays contained 1.0 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in addition to buffer and substrate. Kinetic parameters (K m and k cat) were determined by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the nonlinear regression program Enzfitter (Elsevier-Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). K I values for competitive and noncompetitive inhibitors were determined using standard methods (16Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, New York1975: 100-136Google Scholar). Inactivation of cytosolic β-glucosidase by the covalent inhibitors 2FβGlcF and 2FβManF was monitored using a continuous fluorimetric assay. Working solutions of enzyme (4 μg) were prepared as described above. Enzyme aliquots (15 μl) were preincubated with equal volumes of inhibitor or water (for controls) at 25 °C for varying time periods. At the end of the preincubation period, residual enzyme activity was assayed by injecting 29 μl of the preincubation mixture into 3.0 ml of assay solution containing 5 mmMUGlc, 0.2 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Prior to addition of the preincubation mixture, the assay solution was equilibrated at 35 °C in the thermostated block of a Perkin-Elmer LS-50 spectrofluorimeter. Enzyme activity was quantitated by monitoring the release of 4-methylumbelliferone, using an excitation wavelength of 325 nm and an emission wavelength of 437 nm, with slit widths set at 10 nm. Fluorescence readings were taken at 1 s intervals for 300 s and converted to an ASCII data file. Data files were exported and analyzed by linear regression using Enzfitter. Enzyme activity was proportional to the slope of the regression line. Preliminary experiments determined that this assay procedure yields a linear response with variations in both enzyme and substrate concentration. The enzyme was stable for over 1 h under the conditions of preincubation (using water instead of inhibitor). Pseudo-first order rate constants of inactivation were determined by measuring the time-dependent loss of enzyme activity at each inhibitor concentration. At each concentration of inhibitor, preincubation of enzyme with inhibitor was performed for five or more intervals of increasing duration. The natural logarithm of the residual enzyme activity (ln(v/v0)) was plotted versustime, and the pseudo-first order rate constant was determined from the slope of the resulting regression line. Values for the slopes were accepted if the standard error of the slope was less than or equal to 10% of the magnitude of the slope. Rate constants thus determined (k obs) were used to calculate the maximal rate constant for inactivation (k inact) and the inhibitor binding constant (K I) using the following equation. kobs=kinact[2FβGlcF]KI+[2FβGlcF]Equation 1 An aliquot of the working dilutions of enzyme (4 μg), prepared as described above, was diluted with an equal volume of 0.5m 1-butanol and assayed for activity using the continuous fluorimetric assay. The enzyme solution was then incubated with 0.5 mm 2FβGlcF for 100 min at 25 °C. Excess inhibitor was removed by dilution with 2.0 ml of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, followed by concentration using a Centricon 30 filter. The dilution and concentration steps were repeated once, and the retentate was brought to a final volume of 250 μl in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0. Aliquots of the enzyme-inhibitor complex thus prepared were diluted with an equal volume of 0.5 m 1-butanol and incubated at 37 °C for various time intervals prior to assaying for recovered activity. There was no activity in control aliquots of enzyme incubated with water instead of 1-butanol. The recovery of activity was plotted as a function of time, and the first-order rate constant was calculated using Enzfitter. In separate experiments, enzyme was prepared and inactivated with 2FβGlcF as described above, and the recovery of activity was measured after incubation for 20 min at 37 °C with 0, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 mm 1-butanol. The association constant for 1-butanol was calculated by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. An aliquot (20 μg) of stock β-glucosidase was concentrated using a Centricon 30 filter to remove ethylene glycol and diluted in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, in a final volume of 30 μl. An equal volume of 4 mm 2FβGlcF was added, and the mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 60 min. A control sample of enzyme was incubated with water instead of inhibitor. Following incubation, the enzyme samples were lyophilized to a final volume of 20 μl using a SpeedVac (Savant, Farmingdale, NY), and stored at −20 °C. Immediately prior to analysis, samples were thawed, and a 2.5-μl aliquot was withdrawn and added to 7.5 μl of 80% CH3CN (v/v), 19.9% H2O, and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. The sample was introduced by direct infusion into a Fisons Quattro mass spectrometer (Fisons Instruments, Manchester, United Kingdom) equipped with an Analytica electrospray source (Analytica, Inc., Branford, CT). Data were analyzed using the Fisons Masslynx software. Transglycosylation products generated by CBG were assayed by reversed-phase HPLC. Enzyme assays were performed as described above and terminated by adding 10 μl of 50% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v). Samples were injected onto a C18 column (8 × 100 mm, Waters Delta Pak, Milford, MA). The glycosides of 4-methylumbelliferone were eluted using a Waters 600E gradient controller according to the following linear gradient program: 0–5 min, 100% solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) in dH2O); 5–30 min, 0–35% solvent B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) in acetonitrile); 30–40 min, 35–100% solvent B; 40–42 min, 100% solvent B. The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min. The column effluent was monitored at 314 nm using a Waters 484 variable absorbance detector. Glycosides of p-nitrophenol were analyzed using the same system with slightly modified gradient conditions: 0–5 min, 100% solvent A; 5–25 min, 0–20% solvent B; 20–28 min, 20–80% solvent B; 28–30 min, 80–100% solvent B; 30–32 min, 100% solvent B. The column effluent was monitored at 310 nm forp-nitrophenol glycosides. Disaccharides identified by this procedure were purified for further analysis using identical separation conditions, with manual collection of the appropriate fractions. 1H NMR spectra (600 MHz) and1H-decoupled 13C NMR spectra (125 MHz) were obtained on a Varian UnityPlus 600 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a 3-mm microprobe (Nalorac). Samples were dissolved in2H2O solvent (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) in 3-mm NMR tubes, and spectra were obtained at 25 °C.1H spectra were referenced (internal) to the HOD signal (4.800 ppm), and 13C spectra were referenced (external) to the C-1 signal of α-d-[1-13C]mannopyranose (95.5 ppm). 1H and 13C chemical shifts are accurate to ±0.001 and 0.1 ppm, respectively, unless otherwise noted.1H-1H spin couplings (J values) were extracted directly from the spectra and are accurate to ± 0.1 Hz. Two-dimensional heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence spectra (17Bax A. Subramanian S. J. Magn. Reson. 1986; 67: 565-569Google Scholar) were obtained as 2K × 2K matrices after data processing; gaussian exponential functions were applied to the F1 and F2 dimensions prior to zero-filling and Fourier transformation. Binding energies were calculated using the Gibbs equation, ΔG0=−RTlnKeqEquation 2 where K eq = 1/K m or 1/K I , T = 310 K, andR = 8.3144 J mol−1 K−1. Similarly, changes in the free energies of activation (ΔΔG°′) were calculated using the following relationship, ΔΔG0′=−RTlnkcat1KM1kcat2KM2Equation 3 where the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the K mand k cat values of the two substrates being compared. Inactivation of CBG by 2FβGlcF followed pseudo-first order kinetics (Fig.1 A). We could not calculate the inactivation rate constant (k inact) or the binding affinity (K I) for 2FβGlcF because the rate of inactivation at high concentrations of inhibitor was too rapid to permit the reliable measurement of the pseudo-first order rate constants. The plot of the pseudo-first order rate constantk obs versus [2FβGlcF] was linear, however (Fig. 1 B), which allowed calculation of the ratio ofk inact /K I (0.00122 s−1) according to Equation 1. The competitive inhibitor,N-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside, protected the enzyme against inactivation by 2FβGlcF, thus demonstrating that the inhibitor is active site-directed. To estimate the stoichiometry of inhibitor incorporation, we determined the mass of the enzyme before and after inhibition with 2FβGlcF. The mass of the control enzyme was 53,710 Da, which was consistent with the mass estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (53 ± 1 kDa) (14Hays W.S. Jenison S.A. Yamada T. Pastuszyn A.P. Glew R.H. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The difference of 34 Da between the mass predicted from the cDNA sequence (53,744 Da) and the mass of the purified enzyme is greater than the error for the mass estimation (± 20 Da), which suggests the presence of a posttranslational modification. Incubation of the enzyme with 2FβGlcF resulted in the shift of the major mass peak to 53,875 Da (Fig. 2). The difference of 165 Da represents the incorporation of one 2FGlc residue per enzyme molecule.Figure 2Electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry of CBG inactivated with 2FβGlcF. Purified enzyme (20 μg) was inactivated with 2FβGlcF and analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The tracing in solid linesrepresents the spectrum obtained with the unmodified enzyme. The peak displayed in dashed lines is that obtained with the enzyme inactivated with 2FβGlcF. The masses of the respective species are indicated in Da. The difference of 165 Da between the two major peaks represents the incorporation of one 2FGlc residue per enzyme molecule.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether the inactivated enzyme retained catalytic activity, we assayed for the recovery of enzyme activity by incubation with established transglycosylation acceptors (2Gopalan V. VanderJagt D.J. Libell D.P. Glew R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9629-9638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No reactivation was observed in the presence of 5 mm octyl β-d-glucopyranoside or with 50 mm pNPGlc. However, the 2FβGlcF-inactivated β-glucosidase was reactivated by addition of 1-butanol, a potent transglycosylation acceptor for CBG (2Gopalan V. VanderJagt D.J. Libell D.P. Glew R.H. J. Biol.

Incubation of the completely inactivated enzyme with 0.25 m 1-butanol resulted in exponential recovery of activity, with a rate constant of 0.028 s−1 (Fig.1 C). Reactivation by 1-butanol showed a saturating dependence on 1-butanol concentration (Fig. 1 D), with an association constant of 0.34 m. CBG exhibits a biphasic pattern ofv 0 versus [S] data with the substrates MUGal and MUGlc but not with MUFuc (Fig.3). A previous study demonstrated that CBG forms disaccharides by transferring a sugar moiety to an appropriate acceptor (2Gopalan V. VanderJagt D.J. Libell D.P. Glew R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9629-9638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine whether the biphasic kinetics were due to transglycosylation reactions, we analyzed the reaction products by HPLC. A disaccharide product was detected at concentrations of MUGal greater than 0.1 mm (Fig.4); similar data were obtained with MUGlc (data not shown). In contrast, no disaccharide was produced when MUFuc was the substrate. These data indicated that transglycosylation competes with hydrolysis at high concentrations of MUGal or MUGlc. The inflection point in the v 0 versus[S] data for MUGal suggests that a second substrate molecule binds to the enzyme at concentrations above 0.1 mmand serves as the acceptor for the sugar moiety of the substrate, in lieu of water. The K m andk cat values for hydrolysis and transglycosylation reactions with MUGal and MUGlc were estimated by fitting the data at the extremes of the v 0 versus [S] curves to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The K m and k catvalues for the hydrolysis of both substrates were significantly lower when estimated in this manner than when the correction for transglycosylation was not made (Table I).Figure 4Formation of disaccharide transglycosylation product from MUGal.

The results described above were consistent with a previous demonstration that CBG will transfer sugars to alkyl primary hydroxyl acceptors but not to secondary or tertiary alkyl hydroxyls (2Gopalan V. VanderJagt D.J. Libell D.P. Glew R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9629-9638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that this enzyme would form disaccharide transglycosylation products only with acceptor sugars having a primary hydroxyl. To test this hypothesis, we determined the structures of disaccharide products generated from pNPGal and from mixtures of pNPGal with either pNP-α-l-arabinofuranoside,pNP-α-l-arabinopyranoside, orpNPXyl. Transglycosylation products were purified by HPLC, and their structures were determined by NMR spectroscopy. The 1H NMR spectrum of the disaccharide 1 in2H2O formed from pNPGal alone was identical to that obtained for authentic pNP β-d-galactopyranosyl-(1→6)-β-d-galactopyranoside (Table II), thus establishing its structure (Scheme FS1).Table II1H chemical shifts and 1H-1H spin-coupling constants for disaccharide 1 in 2H2OAssignmentaSee structure 1 (Scheme FS1) for nomenclature; assignments to specific Gal residues are tentative.SignalbIn ppm relative to the HOD signal (4.800 ppm).Observed couplingscIn Hz, ±0.1 Hz.H1′5.3197.7H14.5277.7H5′4.2681.0, 4.1, 8.0H4′4.1621.0, 3.4H6′a4.1594.1, −11.7H6′b4.0588.0, −11.7H44.0021.0, 3.4H2′3.9717.7, 10.0H3′3.9063.4, 10.0H6a3.8907.8, −11.7H6b3.8464.4, −11.7H53.7161.0, 4.4, 7.8a See structure 1 (Scheme FS1) for nomenclature; assignments to specific Gal residues are tentative.b In ppm relative to the HOD signal (4.800 ppm).c In Hz, ±0.1 Hz. Open table in a new tab The reaction of pNPGal with pNP α-l-arabinopyranoside did not produce a disaccharide product, but the reaction of pNPGal with pNP α-l-arabinofuranoside yielded a novel disaccharide,pNP β-d-galactopyranosyl-(1→5)-α-l-arabinofuranoside2. The 13C spectrum (125 MHz) of 2 in2H2O contained 11 nonaromatic signals, which is consistent with a disaccharide composed of hexose (Gal) and pentose (Ara) units (Table III). Characteristic signals at 82.5 and 85.6 ppm indicate the presence of an α-arabinofuranosyl ring (Tables III andIV) (18Bock K. Pedersen C. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1983; 41: 27-66Crossref Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). The C-5 signal of the Ara residue of 2 is observed at 70.3 ppm, which is significantly downfield of the signal found in methyl α-arabinofuranoside (62.4 ppm, Table IV). The latter shift, and the lack of a second hydroxymethyl carbon signal at ∼62 ppm in the 13C spectrum of 2, indicates that the Gal residue is linked at C-5 of Ara. Further evidence of the α-arabinofuranosyl ring derives from the 1H spectrum of 2 in2H2O, which is essentially first-order at 600 MHz (Table III). Endocyclic 1H-1H spin-couplings observed in the Ara component (Table III) are very similar to those found in the authentic pNP α-l-arabinofuranoside (Table V).Table IIINMR data for disaccharide 2DisaccharideNucleus1H shiftsaRelative to the HOD signal (4.800 ppm); ±0.001 ppm.1H-1H spin-coupling constantsb±0.1 Hz.13C shiftscRelative to the C1 signal of α-d-[1-13C]mannopyranose (95.5 ppm); ±0.1 ppm.ppmHzppm2: Gal residued13C Gal assignments are based on those of the β-d-galactopyranosyl residue in 3 (Table VI).H14.543H1,H27.9C1104.8H23.636H2,H310.0C272.3H33.744H3,H43.4C374.2H44.014H4,H5∼0.9C470.2H53.780H5,H67.8C576.7H63.872H5,H6′4.5C662.5H6′3.837H6,H6′−11.52: Ara residueeAra assignments are based on those of methyl α-d-arabinofuranoside (Tables IV and V) (18).H15.985H1,H21.4C1107.0H24.533H2,H33.1C282.5H34.312H3,H45.6C378.0H44.409H4,H55.5C485.6H54.198H4,H5′3.3C570.3a Relative to the HOD signal (4.800 ppm); ±0.001 ppm.b ±0.1 Hz.c Relative to the C1 signal of α-d-[1-13C]mannopyranose (95.5 ppm); ±0.1 ppm.d 13C Gal assignments are based on those of the β-d-galactopyranosyl residue in 3 (Table VI).e Ara assignments are based on those of methyl α-d-arabinofuranoside (Tables IV and V) (18Bock K.

https://openalex.org/W2094934456,"A double-tagging, dual affinity chromatographic procedure, which permits isolation of dimers independently mutated in each subunit, has been exploited to probe the functional topology of the animal fatty acid synthase. Dimers were engineered in which the chain-terminating thioesterase reaction was compromised by mutation of the (active-site) serine residue in both subunits; these dimers assembled two long-chain fatty acyl moieties, which remained covalently linked to the 4′-phosphopantetheine residues of the two acyl carrier protein domains. Significantly, dimers that contained an additional mutation that compromised the activity of either the β-ketoacyl synthase or malonyl/acetyltransferase activity in only one subunit also assembled two long-chain acyl moieties. In contrast, in a control experiment, introduction of an additional mutation that compromised the function of the acyl carrier protein domain in only one subunit resulted in the assembly of only one long-chain acyl moiety per dimer. Because the β-ketoacyl synthase and malonyl/acetyltransferase domains are located near the amino terminus of the polypeptide and the acyl carrier protein domain near the carboxyl terminus, these results support a modified model for the animal fatty acid synthase in which head-to-tail functional contacts are possible both within as well as between subunits.

The animal FAS 1The abbreviations used are: FAS, fatty acid synthase; ACP, acyl carrier protein. 1The abbreviations used are: FAS, fatty acid synthase; ACP, acyl carrier protein.consists of two identical polypeptides, each carrying six enzymes and an acyl carrier protein, that are juxtaposed to form two centers for the synthesis of palmitic acid from acetyl- and malonyl-CoA. The six catalytic domains are clustered in two regions separated by ∼600 residues that have not been ascribed a functional role. Thus the β-ketoacyl synthase, malonyl/acetyltransferase, and dehydrase domains are located within the amino-terminal half of the polypeptide, whereas the enoyl reductase, β-ketoacyl reductase, and thioesterase are located in the carboxyl-terminal half; the ACP domain, which carries the 4′-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group, is located between the β-ketoacyl reductase and thioesterase domains. The development of a model for the FAS was strongly influenced by two key observations. First, the monomeric form of the protein is inactive in the overall FAS reaction (1Smith S. Abraham S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6428-6435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kumar S. Muesing R.A. Porter J.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1979; 254: 7418-7426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), yet two centers for palmitate synthesis are created by the association of subunits in the dimeric form (4Singh N. Wakil S.J. Stoops J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3605-3611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Smith S. Stern A. Randhawa Z.I. Knudsen J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 152: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Second, the two subunits can be cross-linked via the β-ketoacyl synthase, active-site, cysteine thiol of one subunit and the ACP 4′-phosphopantetheine thiol of the companion subunit (6Stoops J.K. Wakil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5128-5133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in the generally accepted model for the FAS, the two polypeptides lie side-by-side in a fully extended, antiparallel configuration such that each of the two centers for palmitate synthesis requires cooperation between catalytic domains located in the amino-terminal half of one subunit with those located in the carboxyl-terminal half of the adjacent subunit (7Wakil S.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4523-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 8Chang S.I. Hammes G.G. Acc. Chem. Res. 1990; 23: 363-369Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 9Smith S. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1248-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Recently we have used a mutant complementation strategy to test and refine this model. The approach requires the engineering of various modified FASs, in which the activity of one of the functional domains is specifically compromised by mutation. Heterodimers formed from subunits containing different, single mutations may be capable of fatty acid synthesis if the two mutations are located on domains that normally cooperate with each other across the subunit interface (10Witkowski A. Joshi A.K. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10569-10575Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Application of this strategy has confirmed several features of the previously proposed model. For example, mutations in either the β-ketoacyl synthase or malonyl/acetyltransferase domain complement mutations in either the ACP or thioesterase domains, whereas mutations in the ACP and thioesterase domains fail to complement each other (11Joshi A.K. Witkowski A. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2316-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 12Joshi A.K. Witkowski A. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1997; 37: 2515-2523Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These findings confirmed that the β-ketoacyl synthase and malonyl/acetyltransferase domains, located in the amino-terminal half of the FAS polypeptide, can contribute to the same center of palmitate synthesis, as do the ACP and thioesterase domains of the companion subunit. However, additional complementation data revealed two features of the FAS topology that were not predicted by the model. First, FAS compromised by a mutation in the dehydrase domain did not complement FASs containing a critical mutation in either the ACP or thioesterase domain but instead complemented FASs mutated in either the β-ketoacyl synthase or malonyl/acetyltransferase domain (11Joshi A.K. Witkowski A. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2316-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 12Joshi A.K. Witkowski A. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1997; 37: 2515-2523Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, the dehydrase domain appears to belong to the carboxyl-terminal complementation group, even though it is physically located in the amino-terminal half of the polypeptide chain (13Joshi A.K. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22508-22513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The implication of this result is that the β-hydroxyacyl-ACP is converted to enoyl-ACP through the action of the dehydrase domain on the same subunit, rather than on the adjacent subunit, as was predicted by the earlier model. Because the dehydrase and ACP domains are separated by >1100 residues, this finding provided the first experimental evidence indicating that the two constituent polypeptides are not simply positioned side-by-side in a fully extended rigid conformation but can coil such that functional contact is possible between domains distantly located on the same polypeptide. Second, mutations in the two amino-terminal domains, the β-ketoacyl synthase and malonyl/acetyltransferase, complement each other, despite the fact that they also complement mutations in the ACP and thioesterase domains, which are located at the carboxyl terminus (11Joshi A.K. Witkowski A. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2316-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar,12Joshi A.K. Witkowski A. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1997; 37: 2515-2523Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This unexpected finding raised the possibility that the malonyl/acetyltransferase domain may be able to deliver substrates to either of the two ACPs in the dimer and that the condensation reaction may be catalyzed by the cooperation of the β-ketoacyl synthase with either of the two ACP domains. On the basis of these results, we proposed a revised model for the FAS in which the substrate loading and condensation reactions can be catalyzed by cooperation between domains across the subunit interface or by cooperation of domains from only one of the subunits (12Joshi A.K. Witkowski A. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1997; 37: 2515-2523Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Active FASs that are reconstituted from inactive mutants by complementation necessarily contain only one functional center for fatty acid synthesis per dimer. However, if the modified model is indeed valid, it follows that FAS dimers containing only one inactive β-ketoacyl synthase or malonyl/acetyltransferase domain ought to be capable of synthesizing fatty acids on both of the ACP domains. The objective of the present study was to test this hypothesis. Anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody and anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel were purchased from Eastman Kodak Co., and anti-His6 monoclonal antibody was fromCLONTECH Laboratories Inc. (Palo Alto, CA).

A second β-ketoacyl synthase mutant, C161A was constructed by first generating a mutated partial cDNA fragment by polymerase chain reaction amplification using primer set M161T3 (5′-TCAAAGGACCCAGCATTGCCCTGGACACAGCCGBATCCTCTAGCCT)/54B1152 (5′-CACTAGAATTCTTCAGGGTTGGGGTTGTGGAAATGC) and pFAS 74.20 (partial FAS cDNA in pUCBM20) as template; the boldface nucleotides encode alanine, glycine, or valine at residue 161. A more detailed account of these procedures has been published previously (13Joshi A.K. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22508-22513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Authenticity of the amplification product was confirmed by DNA sequencing, and te fragment was moved into the full-length wild-type FAS cDNA. Double mutants containing mutations in two different FAS domains were generated by replacing a section of cDNA in the parental single mutant construct with an appropriately mutated fragment. Successful introduction of the mutations was confirmed by standard techniques. The affinity tags hexahistidine (His6), which permits purification by metal-ion chelation chromatography, and FLAG-tag (N′-DYKDDDDK), which permits purification by immunoaffinity chromatography, were incorporated either at the carboxyl terminus or between amino acid residues 1154 and 1157 of the FAS (15Joshi A.K. Rangan V.S. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 4937-4943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were infected with purified recombinant viruses and cultured for 48–72 h at 27 °C, and the tagged FAS proteins were purified from the cytosols as described earlier (14Joshi A.K. Smith S. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); glycerol (10%, v/v) was included in all buffers used for chromatography. FAS was detected in chromatographic fractions by monitoring β-ketoacyl reductase activity. Typically, FLAG-tagged and His6-tagged FASs (in 25–35 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and ∼1% glycerol) were aged at 4 °C for 7–9 days to promote dissociation into their component subunits (1Smith S. Abraham S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6428-6435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Spontaneous reassociation of the subunits was induced by adjustment of the solvent to ∼200 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 10% glycerol and incubation at 30 °C for 75 min. The subunits in a mixture of His6- and FLAG-tagged dimers were randomized, as described above, and the heterodimers containing one His6-tagged and one FLAG-tagged subunit were isolated by chromatography successively on an anti-FLAG column, using the FLAG octapeptide in the eluting buffer, and then on a Ni-NTA column, by including imidazole in the eluting buffer (15Joshi A.K. Rangan V.S. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 4937-4943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Imidazole was removed from the FAS using a DE-53 anion exchange cartridge (14Joshi A.K. Smith S. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). All preparations of FAS that included the S2302A mutation in the thioesterase domain were treated with highly purified recombinant rat mammary gland thioesterase (16Naggert J. Witkowski A. Wessa B. Smith S. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 787-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) to remove fatty acyl chains that had been synthesized in the insect cell host and that remained covalently linked to the 4′-phosphopantetheine thiol. Typically, FAS preparations (5–11 μm) were treated with thioesterase II (1–2 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C, and the thioesterase was removed by affinity chromatography as described above. FASs were incubated with [2-14C]malonyl-CoA, acetyl-CoA, and NADPH; unused acetyl and malonyl moieties were unloaded from the FAS by incubation with CoASH (17Stern A. Sedgwick B. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 799-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and the protein was collected by precipitation with ethanol. Covalently bound fatty acids were released from the protein by treatment with performic acid and derivatized with phenacyl-8 (15Joshi A.K. Rangan V.S. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 4937-4943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The phenacyl fatty acids were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography as described earlier (18Naggert J. Narasimhan M.L. De Veaux L. Cho H. Randhawa Z.I. Cronan Jr., J.E. Green B.N. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11044-11050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recovery of radiolabeled acyl moieties through the ethanol precipitation and performic acid treatment averaged 87%. Overall fatty acid synthesizing activity was measured spectrophotometrically (19Smith S. Abraham S. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 35: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). β-Ketoacyl reductase activity was monitored spectrophotometrically using trans-1-decalone as a model substrate (14Joshi A.K.

Malonyl/acetyltransferase was assayed radiochemically using radiolabeled malonyl- or acetyl-CoA as acyl donor and pantetheine as acceptor; the product was separated from unreacted substrate by thin layer chromatography (21Rangan V.S. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31749-31755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).

FAS preparations were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, using 7.5% polyacrylamide gels, and by Western analysis using either murine anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (10 μg/ml) or murine anti-His6 monoclonal antibody (1:2000 dilution) as the primary antibody and alkaline phosphatase-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG antibody as the secondary antibody (15Joshi A.K.

The objective of this study was to construct FAS heterodimers in which either the malonyl/acetyltransferase or β-ketoacyl synthase activity of only one subunit was compromised by mutation and then to determine whether one or both ACPs were able to participate in fatty acid production. The heterodimers were formed by randomization of the subunits from two different homodimeric FAS species. To isolate a heterodimer population free of contaminating parental homodimers, we made use of a recently described double-tagging procedure in which each of the parental homodimers is tagged with a different affinity label, either hexahistidine or FLAG tag; the heterodimeric species can then be purified by a double affinity chromatographic procedure (15Joshi A.K. Rangan V.S. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 4937-4943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (24) Google Scholar), because each of the tagged homodimeric species binds to only one of the two affinity matrices, whereas the doubly tagged heterodimers bind to both. Two experimental systems were explored. First, to facilitate analysis of the number of fatty acyl chains assembled by such heterodimers, we mutated the active-site serine residue 2302 of the thioesterase domain to alanine in both parental homodimers. This mutation compromises the ability of the FAS to release the fatty acyl chain formed on the 4′-phosphopantetheine (11Joshi A.K. Witkowski A. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2316-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) so that, by using radiolabeled malonyl-CoA as substrate, the stoichiometry of fatty acyl chain assembly can be ascertained (23Libertini L.J. Smith S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 192: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, the thioesterase mutation (TE−) was combined with either malonyl/acetyltransferase, S581A (MAT−), or β-ketoacyl synthase, K326A (KS−), in the parental homodimers. Ser-581 is the nucleophile for the malonyl/acetyltransferase reaction (12Joshi A.K. Witkowski A. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1997; 37: 2515-2523Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and Lys-326 plays an essential role in the β-ketoacyl synthase reaction (22Witkowski A. Joshi K.A. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16338-16344Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The amino acid substitutions in the malonyl/acetyltransferase and β-ketoacyl synthase domains affect only the activity of the mutated domain (10Witkowski A. Joshi A.K. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10569-10575Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar,12Joshi A.K. Witkowski A. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1997; 37: 2515-2523Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Second, to assess the rate of fatty acid synthesis by FASs containing only one active malonyl/acetyltransferase or β-ketoacyl synthase domain, we constructed parental homodimers carrying either the malonyl/acetyltransferase or β-ketoacyl synthase mutations in the context of normal thioesterase domains. In the β-ketoacyl synthase mutation used for these experiments, the Cys-161 nucleophile was replaced by Ala. The activity of the heterodimers formed by hybridizing these homodimers with wild-type homodimers was assessed by normal steady-state kinetic analysis. As a control, in both the determination of the stoichiometry of long acyl chain assembly and in the steady-state kinetic experiments, we also introduced a mutation, S2302A, that eliminates posttranslational insertion of the 4′-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group in the ACP domain (10Witkowski A. Joshi A.K. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10569-10575Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To confirm the authenticity of the various heterodimer preparations used in the study, we assayed both the heterodimers and their parental homodimers for malonyl/acetyltransferase and β-ketoacyl synthase activity (Tables Iand II, respectively). As anticipated, all parental homodimers carrying a critical mutation in either the malonyl/acetyltransferase (S581A) or β-ketoacyl synthase (K326A or C161A) domains lacked activity for either the malonyl/acetyltransferase or the β-ketoacyl synthase partial reaction. Furthermore, heterodimers formed by hybridizing these mutants with either wild-type FAS or TE− FAS had half of the activity of the parental homodimer that exhibited normal activity. Two heterodimers consisting of one wild-type and one malonyl/acetyltransferase mutant subunit were constructed with the His6 and FLAG tags on either of the two subunits; the two different heterodimers both exhibited half of the malonyl/acetyltransferase activity characteristic of the wild-type FAS, indicating that neither the nature nor location of the tag affected activity of the dimers (Table I). Electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by Coomassie Blue staining revealed that all of the affinity-purified FASs were completely homogeneous, and Western analysis confirmed the presence of both His6- and FLAG-tagged subunits in all preparations (details not shown). These data confirmed that each of the highly purified heterodimeric species contained one subunit with a functionally normal malonyl/acetyltransferase or β-ketoacyl synthase and one subunit with a defective malonyl/acetyltransferase (MAT−) or β-ketoacyl synthase (KS−).Table IMalonyl/acetyltransferase activity of FAS heterodimers containing only one functional malonyl/acetyltransferase domainFAS DimersMalonyl/acetyltransferase activitymilliunits/mg% controlTE−(S2302A)aCarboxyl-terminal FLAG-tagged.3310 ± 79100 ± 2.4TE− (S2302A), MAT−(S581A)bHis6-tagged internally, within the noncatalytic region.0.5 ± 0.050.01 ± 0.001TE−(S2302A)aCarboxyl-terminal FLAG-tagged./TE− (S2302A), MAT−(S581A)bHis6-tagged internally, within the noncatalytic region.1740 ± 2552 ± 0.3WTaCarboxyl-terminal FLAG-tagged.3220 ± 60100 ± 1.9MAT−(S581A)cCarboxyl-terminal His6-tagged.0.6 ± 0.050.02 ± 0.002WTaCarboxyl-terminal FLAG-tagged./MAT− (S581A)cCarboxyl-terminal His6-tagged.1680 ± 10052 ± 1.6WTcCarboxyl-terminal His6-tagged.3810 ± 105100 ± 2.7MAT− (S581A)dFLAG-tagged internally, within the noncatalytic region.1.0 ± 0.20.03 ± 0.005WTcCarboxyl-terminal His6-tagged./MAT− (S581A)dFLAG-tagged internally, within the noncatalytic region.1880 ± 12049 ± 1.1Heterodimers were formed by randomization of subunits from pairs of parental homodimers and isolated by dual column affinity chromatography.

The stoichiometry of acyl chain assembly was assessed by incubation of the FASs with [2-14C]malonyl-CoA, acetyl-CoA, and NADPH. As controls, we also prepared dimers containing the thioesterase mutation (TE−) in both subunits and heterodimers containing the ACP, thioesterase double mutation in one subunit and the thioesterase mutation in the companion subunit (ACP−, TE−/TE−); these FAS species would be expected to assemble two and one long-chain acyl moieties per dimer, respectively. In preliminary experiments, the incorporation of radiolabeled malonyl moieties indicated that the stoichiometry of assembly of long-chain acyl moieties attached covalently to the FASs was less than anticipated (1.46 ± 0.04 fatty acyl chains/dimer). We suspected that FASs lacking a catalytically active thioesterase domain might synthesize and retain long-chain acyl moieties in theSf9 cells before to isolation of the proteins, effectively blocking the 4′-phosphopantetheine from assembly of radioactive fatty acyl chains. Therefore, immediately before performing the affinity chromatographic steps, we treated the mutant FASs with rat mammary gland thioesterase II, an enzyme capable of removing acyl chains from thioester linkage to the 4′-phosphopantetheine of the ACP domain (24Libertini L.J. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1393-1401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, the thioesterase was removed from the FAS preparations in the course of the affinity chromatographic procedures. Consistently higher incorporation of radiolabeled malonyl moieties was observed with these thioesterase-treated FASs (equivalent to 1.94 ± 0.14 long acyl chains/dimer). The control experiments confirmed that dimers containing defective thioesterase domains on both subunits (TE−/TE−) assembled two long-chain fatty acyl moieties, whereas dimers containing only one functional ACP domain and two defective thioesterase domains (ACP−, TE−/TE−) assembled only one long-chain fatty acyl moiety (Table III). The MAT−, TE−/TE− and KS−, TE−/TE− heterodimers both assembled two long-chain fatty acyl moieties per dimer (Table III). Identical results were obtained in parallel experiments in which the thioesterase activity was inhibited by treatment with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (15Joshi A.K. Rangan V.S. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 4937-4943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (24) Google Scholar) rather than by mutation (details not shown). These results showed clearly that in dimers containing only a single active malonyl/acetyltransferase or β-ketoacyl synthase domain, fatty acyl chains were assembled on the 4′-phosphopantetheine moieties of both ACP domains.Table IIIStoichiometry of acyl chain assembly by heterodimers containing either one defective malonyl/acetyltransferase or β-ketoacyl synthase domain/dimerHeterodimersTotal long-chain acyl moieties boundAverage lengthAcyl chain length14:06:018:020:022:0mol/mol dimerC atomsmol %TE−ct-His6/TE− ct-Flag1.94 ± 0.1419.41320742ACP−, TE− ct-His6/TE− ct-Flag0.94 ± 0.0619.31325692MAT−, TE− id-His6/TE− ct-Flag1.96 ± 0.0619.4132722KS−, TE− ct-His6/TE− ct-Flag1.60 ± 0.0419.01433611Heterodimers were formed by randomization of subunits from pairs of parental homodimers and isolated by dual column affinity chromatography.

Data represent means ± S.D.s for three experiments. The activity of FASs containing mutated β-ketoacyl synthase or malonyl/acetyltransferase domains was also assessed under steady-state conditions. In these experiments, malonyl/acetyltransferase activity was compromised by replacement of the active site serine residue with alanine (S591A), and β-ketoacyl synthase activity was eliminated by replacement of the active site cysteine residue with alanine (C161A). Both mutant FASs contained normal, catalytically active thioesterase domains so that the products were released from the complex as free fatty acids. In a control experiment, as anticipated, dimers containing only one competent ACP domain (WT/ACP−) exhibited half of the overall fatty acid-synthesizing activity displayed by the wild-type (WT/WT) FAS (Table IV). In contrast, dimers containing only one catalytically active malonyl/acetyltransferase domain (WT/MAT−) exhibited 77% of the wild-type FAS activity. Again, the activity of the WT/MAT− heterodimer was the same regardless of the nature and location of the affinity tag (Table IV, compare second and third lines). The turnover number for the malonyl/acetyltransferase is the highest of any of the individual enzymes of the FAS complex (8Chang S.I. Hammes G.G. Acc. Chem. Res. 1990; 23: 363-369Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17Stern A. Sedgwick B. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 799-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the non-rate-limiting nature of this reaction could account for the ability of a FAS dimer containing only one active copy of the transferase to produce fatty acid products at greater than half of the rate characteristic of the normal complex. The activity of a FAS containing only one catalytically active β-ketoacyl synthase domain (WT/KS−) was 48% of that exhibited by the wild-type FAS. The lower activity of the WT/KS− compared with the WT/MAT− FAS likely reflects the fact that the condensation steps, together with the ketoreduction steps, appear to be rate-determining in the overall reaction (8Chang S.I. Hammes G.G. Acc. Chem. Res. 1990; 23: 363-369Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, although a single catalytically active β-ketoacyl synthase domain has access to both ACP domains, it cannot service both ACPs at a rate approaching that possible when catalytically active β-ketoacyl synthase domains are present on both subunits.Table IVFAS activity of heterodimers containing one normal and one mutated subunitFAS heterodimersFAS activityFLAG-tagged subunitHis6-tagged subunitmilliunits/mg% controlWTaThe FLAG and His6 affinity tags were positioned at the carboxyl terminus.WTaThe FLAG and His6 affinity tags were positioned at the carboxyl terminus.2260 ± 80100 ± 3.5MAT−(S581A)bThe FLAG tag was positioned internally, within the noncatalytic region.WTaThe FLAG and His6 affinity tags were positioned at the carboxyl terminus.1750 ± 3477 ± 1.5WTaThe FLAG and His6 affinity tags were positioned at the carboxyl terminus.MAT− (S581A)aThe FLAG and His6 affinity tags were positioned at the carboxyl terminus.1750 ± 3578 ± 1.6KS−(C161A)bThe FLAG tag was positioned internally, within the noncatalytic region.WTaThe FLAG and His6 affinity tags were positioned at the carboxyl terminus.1078 ± 3048 ± 1.4WTaThe FLAG and His6 affinity tags were positioned at the carboxyl terminus.ACP− (S2151A)aThe FLAG and His6 affinity tags were positioned at the carboxyl terminus.1080 ± 1448 ± 0.6Heterodimers were formed by randomization of subunits from pairs of parental homodimers and isolated by dual column affinity chromatography.

In summary, the results of these experiments provide independent validation of the surprising results obtained in our recent mutant complementation studies that were inconsistent with the prevailing model for the animal FAS (12Joshi A.K. Witkowski A. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1997; 37: 2515-2523Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the earlier study, we found that active-site mutations in either of the two amino-terminal domains, the malonyl/acetyltransferase or β-ketoacyl synthase, were able to complement mutations in the carboxyl-terminal ACP and thioesterase domains but were also able to complement each other. In these mutant complementation analyses, catalytically active heterodimers engineered from pairs of catalytically inactive homodimers inevitably are capable of fatty acid synthesis at only one of the two potential centers. The new experimental approach described in this report was made possible by development of a double affinity-labeling procedure that allows isolation of heterodimers containing independently mutated domains in either one or both FAS subunits. Application of this novel strategy does not involve mutant complementation; rather, it involves the engineering of dimers in which one subunit contains all of the catalytically active domains required to assemble a fatty acid, and mutations in the malonyl/acetyltransferase or β-ketoacyl synthase domains are limited to one subunit. With this system it is possible to determine whether fatty acid assembly can take place at two centers even when one of the constituent domains in the dimer has been inactivated. The results clearly substantiate our recent findings using the mutant complementation strategy and are inconsistent with the classical model for the animal FAS, in which the two subunits are juxtaposed in a fully extended, rigid, antiparallel configuration. Remarkably, although functional contacts are indeed possible between the amino-terminal domains of one subunit and the carboxyl-terminal domains of the opposite subunit, similar functional contacts are also possible between the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal domains of the same subunit. The new findings suggest that the architecture of the multifunctional FAS complex allows for an extraordinary degree of flexibility in the positioning of the domains of the two subunits during the catalytic process.

The carbohydrate moieties of glycoproteins and glycolipids have been shown to be involved in a variety of biological recognition processes including cell-cell and cell-substratum interactions, immunity, apoptosis, and metastasis of tumor cells (1Monsigny M.

The composition and structures of the oligosaccharides correlate with cell differentiation and transformation (cf. Ref. 6Kobata A. Furukawa K. Allen H.J. Kisailus E.C.

For example, the expression of oligosaccharides possessing specific Lewis blood group antigenic determinants is developmentally regulated and altered as a result of differentiation and oncogenic transformation (7Hakomori S.

The molecular recognition properties of the oligosaccharide chains of glycoproteins and glycolipids are often characterized in terms of their interactions with lectins (8$$Google Scholar). A number of mammalian lectins are involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis of glycoproteins (cf. Ref. 2Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 237-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar), while others have been implicated in cellular recognition processes including apoptosis (4Perillo N.L. Pace K.E.

The biological signal transduction properties of lectins appear to be due to their ability to bind and cross-link specific glycoprotein and glycolipid receptors on cells. For example, lectin-induced cross-linking of receptors often leads to mitogenic responses in cells (11Nicolson G.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 457: 57-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), in the arrest of bulk transport in ganglion cell axons (12Edmonds B.T. Koenig E. Cell Motil.

Baum L.G. Nature. 1995; 378: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Furthermore, lectin-induced cross-linking of transmembrane glycoproteins leads to changes in their interactions with cytoskeletal proteins and concomitant alterations in the mobility and aggregation of other surface receptors (15Carraway K.L. Carraway C.A.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 147-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 16Edelman G.M. Science. 1976; 192: 218-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that lectins undergo two general types of cross-linking interactions with multivalent carbohydrates, designated type 1 and type 2 complexes (17Brewer C.F. Chemtracts Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 6: 165-179Google Scholar). In a type 1 complex, binding between a divalent lectin and a divalent carbohydrate results in one dimensional cross-linking (e.g. helical). In a type 2 complex, binding between a multivalent lectin and multivalent carbohydrate, where the valency of either the lectin or carbohydrate is greater than 2, results in two-dimensional (planar or tubular) or three-dimensional cross-linking (crystalline). Importantly, type 2 interactions can lead to the formation of homogeneous cross-linked complexes, even in the presence of mixtures of the molecules (cf. Ref. 17Brewer C.F. Chemtracts Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 6: 165-179Google Scholar). Hence, type 2 interactions are an important source of binding specificity between lectins and glycoconjugate receptors. In order to understand the molecular basis of these cross-linking interactions, x-ray crystallography has been used to investigate several lectin-carbohydrate cross-linked complexes. These include two type 1 complexes involving dimeric animal lectins cross-linked with divalent oligosaccharides (18Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.

The x-ray crystallographic images of those structures, refined to 2.4–2.8-Å resolution, indicate that the stability of the lattices are due to protein-carbohydrate interactions, with essentially no direct lectin-lectin interactions. The results also demonstrate that each carbohydrate cross-linked complex with SBA is a unique lattice, in agreement with previous work on type 2 complexes (cf. Ref. 17Brewer C.F. Chemtracts Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 6: 165-179Google Scholar). The structure of the snowdrop lectin cross-linked with a Man5 oligomannose glycopeptide (22Wright C.S. Hester G. Structure. 1996; 4: 1339-1351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) is another example of a type 2 complex. Interestingly, the glycopeptide exhibits two modes of binding, one involved in cross-linking and one involved in extended site interactions with individual subunits. More recently, the crystal structure of the tetrameric Maclura pomifera agglutinin cross-linked with the T-antigen disaccharide at 2.2-Å resolution has been reported (23Lee X. Thompson A. Zhang Z. Ton-that H. Biesterfeldt J. Ogata C. Xu L. Johnston R.A.Z. Young N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6312-6318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The T-antigen disaccharide functions as a divalent ligand in the complex, even though its binding epitopes are asymmetric. An exception to the above type 1 and type 2 complexes is the x-ray crystal structure reported for the wheat germ agglutinin cross-linked complex with a glycopeptide isolated from glycophorin (24Wright C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14345-14352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cross-linked complex consists of divalent-divalent lectin-carbohydrate interactions, in addition to carbohydrate-carbohydrate stabilizing interactions in the complex. It thus resembles a type 1 interaction with secondary homophilic interactions of the carbohydrate ligand. In the present paper, a structural analysis of the type 2 complex formed by the Fuc-specific tetrameric isolectin A from the seeds ofLotus tetragonolobus (LTL-A) with difucosyllacto-N-neohexaose (Fuc-octa) is described using x-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, image analysis and model building. Our previous work has demonstrated that Fuc-octa binds as a bivalent ligand to LTL-A, and is able to cross-link and precipitate the lectin along with two other analogs of the oligosaccharide (25Bhattacharyya L. Fant J. Lonn H. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7523-7530Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The molecular recognition properties of Fuc-octa are important since it is a naturally occurring biantennary fucosyl oligosaccharide possessing the dimeric Lex blood group antigen (Fig.1). The Lex determinant is an oncofetal antigen since it is transiently expressed during ontogeny and reappears later in a variety of neoplastic diseases (cf.Ref. 5$$Google Scholar). For example, elevated levels of the Lex antigen are present in patients with lung cancer, and colon and liver adenocarcinomas (5$$Google Scholar). LTL-A is a member of the legume family of lectins, which have been widely used to explore the properties of membranes from both normal and transformed cells (26$$Google Scholar, 27$$Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structures of many members of this family have been determined, including concanavalin A (ConA) (28Hardman K.D. Ainsworth C.F.

The results demonstrate that this family of proteins have very similar monomeric structures (40Becker J.W. Reeke Jr., G.N. Trans. Am. Crystallogr. Assoc. 1989; 25: 37-50Google Scholar), but that they often differ in their dimeric and quaternary structures, particularly among tetrameric lectins such as ConA, the peanut agglutinin, and SBA. Like most legume lectins, LTL-A is highly homologous to other members of this family of proteins, including ConA, the prototypical Man/Glc-specific lectin from jack bean (41Konami Y. Yamamoto K. Osawa T. Fed. Eur. Biochem. Soc. J. 1990; 268: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). LTL-A is a tetramer possessing one carbohydrate binding site per subunit ofM r 28,000; hence, it is tetravalent in its carbohydrate binding activity (42Yariv J. Kalb A.J. Katchalski E. Nature. 1967; 215: 890-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Precipitation of LTL-A by three different fucosyl biantennary oligosaccharides, including Fuc-octa, produces three distinct, highly organized, cross-linked lattices as observed by negative stain electron microscopy (25Bhattacharyya L. Fant J. Lonn H. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7523-7530Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for the stability and uniqueness of these lattices has not been established. The LTL-A/Fuc-octa cross-linked lattice was chosen for analysis because of its highly regular structure as observed by electron microscopy (25Bhattacharyya L. Fant J. Lonn H. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7523-7530Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, unlike previously described type 2 complexes, which possess three-dimensional lattice structures (20Dessen A. Gupta D. Sabesan S. Brewer C.F. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4933-4942Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 21Olsen L.R. Dessen A. Gupta D. Sabesan S. Sacchettini J.C. Brewer C.F.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6312-6318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the LTL-A/Fuc-octa complex is the first example of a two-dimensional lattice that is of the type likely to occur on the surface of a cell. The present study thus describes the structure of the lattice in some detail. Seeds of L. tetragonolobus(syn. Tetragonolobus purpureas) were purchased from Schumacher & Co. The native lectin mixture was purified from the crude extract (prepared according to Ref. 42Yariv J. Kalb A.J. Katchalski E. Nature. 1967; 215: 890-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) by affinity chromatography as described previously (43Allen H.J. Johnson E.A.Z. Carbohydr. Res. 1977; 58: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The major isolectin, LTL-A, was separated by DEAE-cellulose chromatography (44Kalb A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 168: 532-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Fuc-octa was obtained from BioCarb Chemicals, Lund, Sweden. The concentrations of sugars were measured by the phenol-sulfuric acid method (45Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (41179) Google Scholar, 46Saha S.K. Brewer C.F. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 254: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The monosaccharides were obtained from Sigma. LTL-A/Fuc-octa precipitations were performed at 4 °C in a final volume of 0.1 ml by using 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.9 m KCl, 1 mmMnCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2 as described previously (54Bhattacharyya L. Haraldsson M. Brewer C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1294-1299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Concentrations of LTL-A (monomer) and Fuc-octa were 100 μm and 90 μm, respectively. Pellets of the LTL-A/Fuc-octa precipitate were aspirated into clean, thin-walled glass capillaries (0.5 or 0.7 mm diameter), and sealed with wax. X-ray diffraction patterns from the precipitates were obtained using radiation from a rotating anode x-ray source (Rigaku, RU200). The double-mirror camera system (47Phillips W.c. Rayment I. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 114: 316-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) was used (CuKa;λ, = 1.54 Å) to produce an x-ray beam with dimensions of approximately 0.3 × 0.3 mm at the film (Kodak diagnostic x-ray film). Specimen-to-film distances were 70–130 mm for most experiments, and the exposure times were usually 24–72 h. Precipitates were negatively stained on 300-mesh, carbon-coated Parlodion grids which had been freshly glow discharged, touched to filter paper, floated on a drop of 1% phosphotungstic acid, pH 7.0, and blotted immediately. Samples were observed at 80 kV in a JEOL 1200EX electron microscope (25Bhattacharyya L. Fant J. Lonn H. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7523-7530Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Electron micrographs were digitized using an Eikonix EC850 digital imaging camera system. Optical densities of the electron micrographs in the range of 0–2 O.D. were coded into 8 bits (integers 0–255). At the setting used, each pixel corresponded to 2.07 Å in the structure. The areas selected from the micrographs for digital filtering contained ∼260 unit cells. To extract the periodic information and determine the symmetry of the lattice in projection, the electron micrographs were filtered to improve the signal to noise ratio (48Stewart M. J. Electron Microscopy Tech. 1988; 9: 301-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This procedure was implemented by computing the Fourier transform of the image, multiplying the transform by a set of Gaussian functions (one around each of the reciprocal lattice points), and then computing a back Fourier transform to obtain the filtered image. To investigate the orientation of the LTL-A tetramer in the lattice, a computer simulation of the filtered electron micrographs was employed. Negative staining was simulated by computing the projected volume of the molecules, in essence to computationally surround the protein with “stain” of uniform density in a manner similar to that used by Steven and Navia (49Steven A.C. Navia M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4721-4725Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). No attempt was made to augment the density near charged groups (which would correspond to positive staining). The structure of the protein tetramer was modeled by using the three-dimensional atomic coordinates of the ConA tetramer (28Hardman K.D. Ainsworth C.F. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4910-4919Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), giving each atom a “weight” proportional to its van der Waals volume. ConA tetramers were rotated computationally into orientations consistent with the lattice symmetry and then projected onto the viewing plane. Calculations were made to determine the possible effect of multiple molecular layers on the images obtained. Further, the relative positions of the two dimers making up the tetramer of LTL-A were varied as suggested by differences that have been observed in the dimer-dimer interactions in the homologous leguminous lectins. Mean phase differences were used as a criterion to evaluate the quality of simulations as detailed by Cabral-Lilly et al. (50Cabral-Lilly D. Phillips G.N. Sosinsky G.E. Melanson L. Chacko S. Cohen C. Biophys. J. 1991; 59: 805-814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Using atomic coordinates for ConA (28Hardman K.D. Ainsworth C.F. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4910-4919Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) obtained from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank, a fragment of the cross-linked lattice was constructed using the molecular software package FRODO on a Silicon Graphics IRIS workstation. Lattice dimensions were taken from the results of x-ray powder diffraction and the positions of the LTL-A dimers in the lattice from comparison of simulated and actual electron micrographs. Models for the lattice were examined to determine the presence of forbidden contacts and the relative positions of the carbohydrate binding sites. X-ray diffraction patterns (Fig.2) obtained from pelleted samples of the LTL-A/Fuc-octa precipitates consist of a set of concentric reflections falling at the reciprocal spacings listed in Table I. All the observed reflections can be indexed on an orthorhombic lattice with lattice dimensions 85.1 × 76.1 × 121.8 Å. As shown below, the 76.1 × 121.8 Å dimensions correspond closely to those observed in electron micrographs of the lattice in projection. The 85.1 Å dimension corresponds to the thickness of the two-dimensional lattice. Only two “meridonal” reflections (second and third order of the 85.1 Å repeat) are observed. This suggests a partial stacking of the lattices in the pellet. The remainder of the observed reflections correspond to “equatorial” reflections from the two-dimensional lattice. This is typical of diffraction from two-dimensional arrays in which the meridional and equatorial reflections usually dominate the diffraction pattern, with off-equatorial reflections other than the meridionals being very weak. The presence of partial stacking of the lattices was confirmed using electron microscopy of frozen-fratured pellets (data not shown). These micrographs indicate that in most cases the lattices stack in register.Table IX-ray spacing data for the LTL-A/Fuc-octa cross-linked complexObserved and calculated positions of x-ray diffraction peaksaOnly meridional and equatorial reflections are listed since off-equatorial reflections other than the meridional reflections are expected to be weak.IndexObservedCalculatedÅ−1Å−1(0,1,0)0.01530.0155(2,0,0)0.02210.0235(0,1,1)0.02630.0263(0,2,0)0.03030.0310(3,0,0)0.03500.0353(0,2,1)0.04050.0403(0,3,0)0.04750.0465(0,2,2)0.05270.0526(0,4,0)0.06230.0620(0,4,1)0.07000.0702(0,5,0)0.07810.0775(0,5,1)0.08550.0854(0,6,0)0.09320.0930Predicted values are based on a orthorhombic lattice with dimensions 85.1 Å × 76.1 Å × 121.8 Å.a Only meridional and equatorial reflections are listed since off-equatorial reflections other than the meridional reflections are expected to be weak. Open table in a new tab Predicted values are based on a orthorhombic lattice with dimensions 85.1 Å × 76.1 Å × 121.8 Å. In electron micrographs of negatively stained specimens (e.g. Fig.3 A), the stain-excluding regions appear to be concentrated along two sets of intersecting lines rotated by 62–65° relative to one another. Dimensions determined from the micrographs varied slightly, but fell within expected errors of the dimensions obtained in the x-ray powder diffraction experiments. Stain is concentrated in diamond- or triangular-shaped regions between these two linear arrays. Some lattices exhibited substantially greater contrast than others, suggesting the presence of multiple layers. However, the overall distribution of stain-excluding material in the lattices appeared independent of the contrast, suggesting that if lattice stacking did occur, the lattices stack in register. This is consistent with the indexing of the x-ray powder diffraction patterns indicating an orthorhombic lattice and electron micrographs of frozen-fractured pellets. The power spectrum (square of the Fourier transform) of the electron micrograph in Fig. 3 B (enlargement of Fig. 3 A) is shown in Fig. 3 C. Peaks fall on a lattice with dimensions of approximately 1/76 × 1/122 Å−1. Peaks are observable to approximately 19 Å resolution in transforms from the most highly ordered specimens. Fig. 3 D is a filtered image of the electron micrograph of the lattice in Fig. 3 B. In the filtered images of the LTL-A lattices, the stain-excluding material is concentrated at the vertices of the intersecting lines of stain-excluding material noted in the original micrographs. The LTL-A tetramer appears to be centered at these points. The micrograph in Fig.3 has mirror lines through these points, corresponding to in-plane two-fold axes in the lattice. The ConA tetramer has 222-point group symmetry and it is likely that the LTL-A tetramer also exhibits this symmetry. One of the molecular two-fold axes probably corresponds to the observed lattice two-fold, greatly limiting the possible models for the molecular structure of the lattice. Modeling of the lattice structure requires the identification of the crystallographic two-fold axis and the location of the two molecular two-fold axes that are non-crystallographic. LTL-A is 41.7% identical in sequence to ConA, 39.6% identical to favin, and 40.8% identical to pea lectin (41Konami Y. Yamamoto K. Osawa T. Fed. Eur. Biochem. Soc. J. 1990; 268: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the dimers of ConA, favin, and pea lectin are very similar; the root-mean-square difference in α-carbon positions being 0.87 Å for 185 equivalent α-carbons in ConA and pea lectin (32Einspahr H. Parks E.H. Suguna K. Subramanian E. Suddath F.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16518-16527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 1.4 Å for the 217 common α-carbons of ConA and favin (51Reeke Jr., G.N. Becker J.W. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1986; 139: 35-58Google Scholar). The largest differences are near the ends of the permuted sequence in ConA, and in the vicinity of small insertions and deletions. The difference in dimer structure between ConA and LTL-A should be comparable, making the ConA dimer structure a suitable model for the LTL-A dimer at low resolution. To generate all possible orientations of the LTL-A tetramer consistent with the observed symmetry of the lattice, models were constructed using the known molecular structure of ConA. Each of the three molecular two-fold axes of the tetramer were aligned with the crystallographic axis in turn. The tetramer was then rotated about that axis in 3° steps, and a simulated micrograph was calculated. The resolution of the simulation was limited to 19 Å to match that of the electron micrographs. Fourier transforms of the simulated micrographs were calculated and a mean phase difference between Fourier transforms of simulated and observed electron micrographs was calculated. Plots of mean phase difference indicated models most consistent with the electron micrographs, but the correspondence between simulated and actual micrographs remained unsatisfactory for even the best models. The failure of the original modeling to adequately simulate the electron micrographs indicated the need to consider additional modeling parameters. Two that were considered were the possibility of multiple layers and variation of the dimer-dimer contact angle. To test for the effect of multiple layers, two- and three-layer models were simulated and searches identical to that described above were carried out for a broad range of relative positions of the layers. Correspondence between calculated and observed micrographs became progessively worse for shifts of multiple layers relative to one another."
