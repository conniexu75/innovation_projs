https://openalex.org/W2236786161,"Although trace levels of phosphorylated α-synuclein (α-syn) are detectable in normal brains, nearly all α-syn accumulated within Lewy bodies in Parkinson disease brains is phosphorylated on serine 129 (Ser-129). The role of the phosphoserine residue and its effects on α-syn structure, function, and intracellular accumulation are poorly understood. Here, co-expression of α-syn and polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2), a kinase that targets Ser-129, was used to generate phosphorylated α-syn for biophysical and biological characterization. Misfolding and fibril formation of phosphorylated α-syn isoforms were detected earlier, although the fibrils remained phosphatase- and protease-sensitive. Membrane binding of α-syn monomers was differentially affected by phosphorylation depending on the Parkinson disease-linked mutation. WT α-syn binding to presynaptic membranes was not affected by phosphorylation, whereas A30P α-syn binding was greatly increased, and A53T α-syn was slightly lower, implicating distal effects of the carboxyl- on amino-terminal membrane binding. Endocytic vesicle-mediated internalization of pre-formed fibrils into non-neuronal cells and dopaminergic neurons matched the efficacy of α-syn membrane binding. Finally, the disruption of internalized vesicle membranes was enhanced by the phosphorylated α-syn isoforms, a potential means for misfolded extracellular or lumenal α-syn to access cytosolic α-syn. Our results suggest that the threshold for vesicle permeabilization is evident even at low levels of α-syn internalization and are relevant to therapeutic strategies to reduce intercellular propagation of α-syn misfolding."
https://openalex.org/W2201163923,"The increasing prevalence of acquired and transmitted HIV-1 drug resistance is an obstacle to successful antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) hardest hit by the HIV-1 pandemic. Genotypic drug resistance testing could facilitate the choice of initial ART in areas with rising transmitted drug resistance (TDR) and enable care-providers to determine which individuals with virological failure (VF) on a first- or second-line ART regimen require a change in treatment. An inexpensive near point-of-care (POC) genotypic resistance test would be useful in settings where the resources, capacity, and infrastructure to perform standard genotypic drug resistance testing are limited. Such a test would be particularly useful in conjunction with the POC HIV-1 viral load tests that are currently being introduced in LMICs. A POC genotypic resistance test is likely to involve the use of allele-specific point mutation assays for detecting drug-resistance mutations (DRMs). This study proposes that two major nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-associated DRMs (M184V and K65R) and four major NNRTI-associated DRMs (K103N, Y181C, G190A, and V106M) would be the most useful for POC genotypic resistance testing in LMIC settings. One or more of these six DRMs was present in 61.2% of analyzed virus sequences from ART-naïve individuals with intermediate or high-level TDR and 98.8% of analyzed virus sequences from individuals on a first-line NRTI/NNRTI-containing regimen with intermediate or high-level acquired drug resistance. The detection of one or more of these DRMs in an ART-naïve individual or in a individual with VF on a first-line NRTI/NNRTI-containing regimen may be considered an indication for a protease inhibitor (PI)-containing regimen or closer virological monitoring based on cost-effectiveness or country policy."
https://openalex.org/W2203187780,"Is nucleotide exchange sufficient to activate K-Ras4B? To signal, oncogenic rat sarcoma (Ras) anchors in the membrane and recruits effectors by exposing its effector lobe. With the use of NMR and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we observed that in solution, farnesylated guanosine 5'-diphosphate (GDP)-bound K-Ras4B is predominantly autoinhibited by its hypervariable region (HVR), whereas the GTP-bound state favors an activated, HVR-released state. On the anionic membrane, the catalytic domain adopts multiple orientations, including parallel (∼180°) and perpendicular (∼90°) alignments of the allosteric helices, with respect to the membrane surface direction. In the autoinhibited state, the HVR is sandwiched between the effector lobe and the membrane; in the active state, with membrane-anchored farnesyl and unrestrained HVR, the catalytic domain fluctuates reinlessly, exposing its effector-binding site. Dimerization and clustering can reduce the fluctuations. This achieves preorganized, productive conformations. Notably, we also observe HVR-autoinhibited K-Ras4B-GTP states, with GDP-bound-like orientations of the helices. Thus, we propose that the GDP/GTP exchange may not be sufficient for activation; instead, our results suggest that the GDP/GTP exchange, HVR sequestration, farnesyl insertion, and orientation/localization of the catalytic domain at the membrane conjointly determine the active or inactive state of K-Ras4B. Importantly, K-Ras4B-GTP can exist in active and inactive states; on its own, GTP binding may not compel K-Ras4B activation.-Jang, H., Banerjee, A., Chavan, T.

https://openalex.org/W2220782041,"Skeletal muscle regeneration following acute injury is a multi-step process involving complex changes in tissue microenvironment. Macrophages (MPs) are one of the key cell types involved in orchestration and modulation of the repair process. Multiple studies highlight the essential role of MPs in the control of the myogenic program and inflammatory response during skeletal muscle regeneration. A variety of MP phenotypes have been identified and characterized in vitro as well as in vivo. As such, MPs hold great promise for cell-based therapies in the field of regenerative medicine. In this study we used bone-marrow derived in vitro LPS/IFN-y-induced M1 MPs to enhance functional muscle recovery after tourniquet-induced ischemia/reperfusion injury (TK-I/R). We detected a 15% improvement in specific tension and force normalized to mass after M1 (LPS/IFN-γ) MP transplantation 24 hours post-reperfusion. Interestingly, we found that M0 bone marrow-derived unpolarized MPs significantly impaired muscle function highlighting the complexity of temporally coordinated skeletal muscle regenerative program. Furthermore, we show that delivery of M1 (LPS/IFN-γ) MPs early in regeneration accelerates myofiber repair, decreases fibrotic tissue deposition and increases whole muscle IGF-I expression."
https://openalex.org/W2216162165,"West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-transmitted Flavivirus belonging to the Japanese encephalitis antigenic complex of the Flaviviridae family. Its spread in the Mediterranean basin and the Balkans poses a significant risk to human health and forces public health officials to constantly monitor the virus transmission to ensure prompt application of preventive measures. In this context, predictive tools indicating the areas and periods at major risk of WNV transmission are of paramount importance. Spatial analysis approaches, which use environmental and climatic variables to find suitable habitats for WNV spread, can enhance predictive techniques. Using the Mahalanobis Distance statistic, areas ecologically most suitable for sustaining WNV transmission were identified in the Mediterranean basin and Central Europe. About 270 human and equine clinical cases notified in Italy, Greece, Portugal, Morocco, and Tunisia, between 2008 and 2012, have been considered. The environmental variables included in the model were altitude, slope, night time Land Surface Temperature, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Enhanced Vegetation Index, and daily temperature range. Seasonality of mosquito population has been modelled and included in the analyses to produce monthly maps of suitable areas for West Nile Disease. Between May and July, the most suitable areas are located in Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, and North Cyprus. Summer/Autumn months, particularly between August and October, characterize the suitability in Italy, France, Spain, the Balkan countries, Morocco, North Tunisia, the Mediterranean coast of Africa, and the Middle East. The persistence of suitable conditions in December is confined to the coastal areas of Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, and Israel."
https://openalex.org/W2230418835,"The human visual system (HVS) plays an important role in stereo image quality perception. Therefore, it has aroused many people’s interest in how to take advantage of the knowledge of the visual perception in image quality assessment models. This paper proposes a full-reference metric for quality assessment of stereoscopic images based on the binocular difference channel and binocular summation channel. For a stereo pair, the binocular summation map and binocular difference map are computed first by adding and subtracting the left image and right image. Then the binocular summation is decoupled into two parts, namely additive impairments and detail losses. The quality of binocular summation is obtained as the adaptive combination of the quality of detail losses and additive impairments. The quality of binocular summation is computed by using the Contrast Sensitivity Function (CSF) and weighted multi-scale (MS-SSIM). Finally, the quality of binocular summation and binocular difference is integrated into an overall quality index. The experimental results indicate that compared with existing metrics, the proposed metric is highly consistent with the subjective quality assessment and is a robust measure. The result have also indirectly proved hypothesis of the existence of binocular summation and binocular difference channels."
https://openalex.org/W2215502632,"Cooperative binding is one of the most interesting and not fully understood phenomena involved in control and regulation of biological processes. Here we analyze the simplest phenomenological model that can account for cooperativity (i.e. ligand binding to a macromolecule with two binding sites) by generating equilibrium binding isotherms from deterministically simulated binding time courses. We show that the Hill coefficients determined for cooperative binding, provide a good measure of the Gibbs free energy of interaction among binding sites, and that their values are independent of the free energy of association for empty sites. We also conclude that although negative cooperativity and different classes of binding sites cannot be distinguished at equilibrium, they can be kinetically differentiated. This feature highlights the usefulness of pre-equilibrium time-resolved strategies to explore binding models as a key complement of equilibrium experiments. Furthermore, our analysis shows that under conditions of strong negative cooperativity, the existence of some binding sites can be overlooked, and experiments at very high ligand concentrations can be a valuable tool to unmask such sites."
https://openalex.org/W2206562865,"Social status hierarchies are ubiquitous in vertebrate social systems, including humans. It is well known that social rank can influence quality of life dramatically among members of social groups. For example, high-ranking individuals have greater access to resources, including food and mating prerogatives that, in turn, have a positive impact on their reproductive success and health. In contrast low ranking individuals typically have limited reproductive success and may experience lasting social and physiological costs. Ultimately, social rank and behavior are regulated by changes in gene expression. However, little is known about mechanisms that transduce social cues into transcriptional changes. Since social behavior is a dynamic process, we hypothesized that a molecular mechanism such as DNA methylation might play a role these changes. To test this hypothesis, we used an African cichlid fish, Astatotilapia burtoni, in which social rank dictates reproductive access. We show that manipulating global DNA methylation state strongly biases the outcomes of social encounters. Injecting DNA methylating and de-methylating agents in low status animals competing for status, we found that animals with chemically increased methylation states were statistically highly likely to ascend in rank. In contrast, those with inhibited methylation processes and thus lower methylation levels were statistically highly unlikely to ascend in rank. This suggests that among its many roles, DNA methylation may be linked to social status and more generally to social behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2205658576,"Background Cabbage stem flea beetle (CSFB), Psylliodes chrysocephala L. (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) is a major early season pest of oilseed rape throughout Europe. Pyrethroids have been used for controlling this pest by foliar application, but in recent years control failures have occurred, particularly in Germany due to the evolution of knock-down resistance (kdr). The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence and spread of pyrethroid resistance in CSFB collected in Germany, Denmark and the United Kingdom during 2014. The level of pyrethroid resistance was measured in adult vial tests and linked to the presence of kdr genotypes. Results Although kdr (L1014F) genotypes are present in all three countries, marked differences in pyrethroid efficacy were found in adult vial tests. Whereas Danish CSFB samples were in general susceptible to recommended label rates, those collected in the UK mostly resist such rates to some extent. Moderately resistant and susceptible samples were found in Germany. Interestingly, some of the resistant samples from the UK did not carry the kdr allele, which is in contrast to German CSFB. Pre-treatment with PBO, prior to exposure to λ-cyhalothrin suggested involvement of metabolic resistance in UK samples. Conclusion Danish samples were mostly susceptible with very low resistance ratios, while most other samples showed reduced sensitivity in varying degrees. Likewise, there was a clear difference in the presence of the kdr mutation between the three countries. In the UK, the presence of kdr genotypes did not always correlate well with resistant phenotypes. This appears to be primarily conferred by a yet undisclosed, metabolic-based mechanism. Nevertheless our survey disclosed an alarming trend concerning the incidence and spread of CSFB resistance to pyrethroids, which is likely to have negative impacts on oilseed production in affected regions due to the lack of alternative modes of action for resistance management purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2281936900,"The model prokaryote Escherichia coli contains seven copies of the rRNA operon in the genome. The presence of multiple rRNA operons is an advantage for increasing the level of ribosome, the key apparatus of translation, in response to environmental conditions. The complete sequence of E. coli genome, however, indicated the micro heterogeneity between seven rRNA operons, raising the possibility in functional heterogeneity and/or differential mode of expression. The aim of this research is to determine the strength and regulation of the promoter of each rRNA operon in E. coli. For this purpose, we used the double-fluorescent protein reporter pBRP system that was developed for accurate and precise determination of the promoter strength of protein-coding genes. For application of this promoter assay vector for measurement of the rRNA operon promoters devoid of the signal for translation, a synthetic SD sequence was added at the initiation codon of the reporter GFP gene, and then approximately 500 bp-sequence upstream each 16S rRNA was inserted in front of this SD sequence. Using this modified pGRS system, the promoter activity of each rrn operon was determined by measuring the rrn promoter-directed GFP and the reference promoter-directed RFP fluorescence, both encoded by a single and the same vector. Results indicated that: the promoter activity was the highest for the rrnE promoter under all growth conditions analyzed, including different growth phases of wild-type E. coli grown in various media; but the promoter strength of other six rrn promoters was various depending on the culture conditions. These findings altogether indicate that seven rRNA operons are different with respect to the regulation mode of expression, conferring an advantage to E. coli through a more fine-tuned control of ribosome formation in a wide range of environmental situations. Possible difference in the functional role of each rRNA operon is also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2219431323,"Mutations in the Autism susceptibility candidate 2 gene (AUTS2) have been associated with a broad range of psychiatric illnesses including autism spectrum disorders, intellectual disability and schizophrenia. We previously demonstrated that the cytoplasmic AUTS2 acts as an upstream factor for the Rho family small GTPase Rac1 and Cdc42 that regulate the cytoskeletal rearrangements in neural cells. Moreover, genetic ablation of the Auts2 gene in mice has resulted in defects in neuronal migration and neuritogenesis in the developing cerebral cortex caused by inactivation of Rac1-signaling pathway, suggesting that AUTS2 is required for neural development. In this study, we conducted a battery of behavioral analyses on Auts2 heterozygous mutant mice to examine the involvement of Auts2 in adult cognitive brain functions. Auts2-deficient mice displayed a decrease in exploratory behavior as well as lower anxiety-like behaviors in the absence of any motor dysfunction. Furthermore, the capability for novel object recognition and cued associative memory were impaired in Auts2 mutant mice. Social behavior and sensory motor gating functions were, however, normal in the mutant mice as assessed by the three-chamber test and prepulse inhibition test, respectively. Together, our findings indicate that AUTS2 is critical for the acquisition of neurocognitive function."

However, the physiologic function of Crym in skeletal muscle remains to be elucidated. In this study, Crym was preferentially expressed in skeletal muscle throughout the body. Crym-knockout mice exhibited a significant hypertrophy of fast-twitch glycolytic type IIb fibers, causing an increase in grip strength and high intensity running ability in Crym-null mice. Genetic inactivation of Crym or blockade of Crym by siRNA-mediated knockdown up-regulated the gene expression of fast-glycolytic contractile fibers in satellite cell-derived myotubes in vitro These alterations in Crym-inactivated muscle were rescued by inhibition of thyroid hormone, even though Crym is a positive regulator of thyroid hormone action in nonmuscle cells. The results demonstrated that Crym is a crucial regulator of muscle plasticity, controlling metabolic and contractile properties of myofibers, and thus the selective inactivation of Crym may be a potential therapeutic target for muscle-wasting diseases, such as muscular dystrophies and age-related sarcopenia.-Seko, D., Ogawa, S., Li, T.-S., Taimura, A., Ono, Y. μ-Crystallin controls muscle function through thyroid hormone action."
https://openalex.org/W2221325499,"Recognition and repair of double-stranded DNA breaks (DSB) involves the targeted recruitment of BRCA tumor suppressors to damage foci through binding of both ubiquitin (Ub) and the Ub-like modifier SUMO. RAP80 is a component of the BRCA1 A complex, and plays a key role in the recruitment process through the binding of Lys(63)-linked poly-Ub chains by tandem Ub interacting motifs (UIM). RAP80 also contains a SUMO interacting motif (SIM) just upstream of the tandem UIMs that has been shown to specifically bind the SUMO-2 isoform. The RAP80 tandem UIMs and SIM function collectively for optimal recruitment of BRCA1 to DSBs, although the molecular basis of this process is not well understood. Using NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the RAP80 SIM binds SUMO-2, and that both specificity and affinity are enhanced through phosphorylation of the canonical CK2 site within the SIM. The affinity increase results from an enhancement of electrostatic interactions between the phosphoserines of RAP80 and the SIM recognition module within SUMO-2. The NMR structure of the SUMO-2·phospho-RAP80 complex reveals that the molecular basis for SUMO-2 specificity is due to isoform-specific sequence differences in electrostatic SIM recognition modules."
https://openalex.org/W2240108656,"Members of the receptor tyrosine kinase family (RTK) have been shown to be present in the nucleus of cells; however, the mechanisms underlying their trafficking to the nucleus, and their relevance once there are poorly understood.

We show that heregulin-stimulation induces trafficking of phosphorylated ErbB3 from the plasma membrane to the nucleus via a clathrin-independent mechanism. Nuclear import of ErbB3 occurs via importin β1, which drives the receptor through the nuclear pore complex. In the nucleus, ErbB3 interacts with transcription complexes, and thereby has a role in transcriptional regulation. Our results also demonstrate that ErbB3 nuclear localization is transient as it is exported out of the nucleus by the nuclear receptor protein crm-1.

The epidermal growth factor receptor family (EGFR, 3The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase family; HRG, heregulin. ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4) comprises some of the best characterized members of the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Their activation influences cellular signaling via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathways, both of which regulate essential cellular mechanisms including cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. Dysregulation of these pathways is regularly found in carcinogenesis, tumor progression, and metastasis (1Hynes N.E. MacDonald G. ErbB receptors and signaling pathways in cancer.Curr. Opin.

In the present study, we demonstrate that nuclear translocation of ErbB3 is not limited to cancer, but appears to be a general phenomenon in proliferating tissues. To clarify ErbB3 trafficking from the cell surface to the nucleus, and its function once there, we applied a comprehensive approach using subcellular fractionation, cell surface protein labeling, immunostaining, and live cell imaging to investigate the transfer of ErbB3 to the nucleus. In addition, we studied the activation state, the translocation mechanisms, and the nuclear entry of ErbB3. To understand its function in the nucleus, we investigated the prevalence of nuclear ErbB3 in both controlled and diseased tissues. Our findings support an alternative pathway to the canonical signaling, which leads to a direct interaction of the surface receptor with the transcriptional machinery in the nucleus. BT474 and T47D cells (from Cell Lines Service, Germany) were cultivated in DMEM/F12 (1:1) medium (PAN Biotech) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FCS (PAN Biotech), 2 mm glutamine (PAN Biotech), and antibiotics. MCF-7 cells (DSMZ, Germany) were cultivated in DMEM (PAN Biotech) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Sigma), 10 μg/ml insulin (Sigma), MEM non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), and antibiotics. HEK 293T cells were cultivated in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FCS and antibiotics. Cells were maintained in humidified incubators with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. DSMZ confirmed cell line identity and purity by DNA fingerprinting. To induce nuclear translocation, cells were starved in FCS-free cultivation medium overnight and stimulated with 50 ng/ml of respective growth factors for the indicated time. Growth factors used were HRG β1 EGF domain, TGF-α, EGF, and amphiregulin (all R&D systems). To inhibit nuclear export cells were incubated with 20 ng/ml leptomycin B (Tocris) for 1 h before ligand stimulation. Subsequent subcellular fractionation was done as published previously (12Ledoux S. Yang R. Friedlander G. Laouari D.

Briefly, ∼1 × 107 cells were lysed in 800 μl of hypotonic buffer (3 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, in 40 mm HEPES, pH 8.0) supplemented with a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma) and homogenized by drawing through a 26-gauge needle of a syringe. After centrifugation at 700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were analyzed for cytosolic proteins. The pellets, containing the nuclear fraction, were washed 3× with isotonic sucrose buffer (250 mm sucrose, 0.5% Triton X-100, 6 mm MgCl2 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) at 700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellets containing the nuclear fractions were re-suspended in 150 μl of high salt buffer (hypertonic buffer plus 500 mm KCl) supplemented with 50 units of benzonase (Novagen) and protease/phosphatase inhibitors on a rotating wheel for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, supernatants were collected as nuclear fractions. 50 μg of protein of the fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting. Approximately 20000cells were seeded onto poly l-lysine-coated 14-mm coverslips. After 3 days of cultivation, cells were treated the same way as described for the translocation assay. Cell fixation was done with 4% PFA for 20 min at room temperature. After 3× washing with PBS, residual formaldehyde was quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 10 min. Cell permeabilization was done with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature and 3× washed with PBS. After blocking with 5% BSA, 1% Tween in PBS, cells were incubated with ErbB3 antibody (Ab-12708; 1:100, Cell Signaling) diluted in staining buffer (1% BSA, 0.1% Tween in PBS) overnight at 4 °C followed by 3x washing with PBS. The secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647 (1:500, Invitrogen) was incubated for 1 h in staining buffer at room temperature. Cells were washed 3× with PBS, and nuclei were stained with DAPI before mounting. Z-stacks covering the cell nuclei were taken with a FluoViewTM FV1000 (Olympus) confocal microscope using a 63 × 1.35 NA oil immersion objective. Presented images are maximum intensity projections. Images were performed with FluoView Software (Olympus). Protein samples analyzed for ErbB3 were resolved with SDS-PAGE using self-casted 8% acrylamide gels. Other samples were resolved in NuPAGE Novex 3–8% Tris Acetate gels (Invitrogen), according to manufacturer's instructions. Separated proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Perkin Elmer) with a semi-dry blotting system (Trans-Blot S.D., Bio-Rad) using 5 mA/cm2 for 40 min. For immunodetection, the following antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilution unless otherwise indicated: ErbB3 (Ab-1328, 1:500; Signalway); phospho-ErbB3 (Y1289), EGFR, ErbB2, cyclin D1, and calnexin (Cell Signaling); NUP358 and RNA polymerase (Bethyl Laboratories); HIF1-α (Novus Biological); dynamin (Calbiochem); clathrin, crm-1, importin β1, lamin A/C (BD Biosciences); α-tubulin, STAT 3, and STAT 5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); histone H3, E2F-1, and phospho-EGFR (Y1173) (Abcam). Secondary horseradish peroxidase-coupled antibodies were from Cell Signaling. Recombinant HRG β1 extracellular domain (R&D Systems) was fluorescently labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 microscale protein labeling kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 20000 T47D cells were seeded onto poly l-lysine-coated 4 well μ-slides (Ibidi) and prepared for the translocation assay. Cells were incubated with 4 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Invitrogen) for 20 min at 37 °C and subsequently labeled with 2 μg/ml HRG488 at 4 °C for 1 h. Trafficking was initiated by medium change to 37 °C containing 0.4 μg/ml Hoechst. For time-lapse movies, a custom modified inverted LSM MP7 (Zeiss) with a 63× NA 1.2 water immersion objective was used. During recordings, cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in an incubation chamber (Solent Scientific). The frame rate was 5 s. For excitation, a Chameleon Ultra II laser (Coherent) tuned to 740 nm was used. For analysis of ErbB3 activation, the overnight starvation medium of ErbB3 translocation assay was supplemented with 20 μg/ml pertuzumab (Genentech) or 1 μm lapatinib (GlaxoSmithKline). Subsequently, ErbB3 translocation assay was performed in the presence of the inhibitors; the cells were fractionated and analyzed by immunoblotting. To prevent trafficking, all biotin labeling steps were carried out at 4 °C. To ∼1 × 106 T47D cells prepared for translocation assay, 10 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 250 μg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Thermo Scientific) was added and incubated gently agitating for 30 min. Labeling was stopped by adding 800 μl of quenching buffer (137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2.3 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na2HPO4 in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0) for 10 min. After washing with ice-cold medium, membrane protein trafficking was initiated by adding 37 °C cultivation medium containing 50 ng/ml HRG for the indicated time points. Subcellular fractions were affinity purified with streptavidin magnetic beads (Thermo Scientific). 50 μl of beads were added to 800 μg of protein and rotated. Next day, beads were separated with a magnet and washed 3× with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Proteins were eluted by boiling in sample SDS buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting. To examine the endocytic pathway, T47D cells were incubated with either 100 μm chlorpromazin (Sigma) for 30 min or 1 μg/ml filipin III (Sigma) for 1 h. Cells were biotin-labeled as described, but after HRG stimulation at indicated time points, residual surface biotin was removed from the cells by incubating twice with 180 mm MesNa (Sigma) for 15 min at 4 °C. Excessive MesNa was quenched with 5 mg/ml iodoacetamide (Sigma) for 10 min. Subcellular fractions were affinity purified with MagStrep streptavidin beads as mentioned and analyzed by immunoblotting. The following RNAi (Invitrogen) oligonucleotides against crm-1 (s14938), clathrin (HSS174637), NUP358 (HSS109043), importin β1 (HSS180197) were used. For control experiments, scrambled siRNA was used (Invitrogen). Approximately 1 Mio cells were transfected with 20 nm siRNA oligoribonucleotides using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cultures were maintained for 72 h before analysis. Subcellular fractions were prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting. Approximately 20000 cells were seeded onto poly l-lysine coated 14 mm coverslips. After 2 days of cultivation, cells were treated the same way as described for the translocation assay. For HRG488 labeling, 2 μg/ml HRG488 was added at 4 °C for 1 h. Trafficking was initiated by medium change to 37 °C. After the indicated time points, cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 15 min at room temperature and washed 3× with PBS. Staining was done in PBS containing 1% BSA, rhodamin-phalloidin (1:1000, Invitrogen) and DAPI (1:20000; Invitrogen) for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were washed 3× with PBS and mounted with Fluor Preserve (Calbiochem). For endocytic inhibition, 1 μg/ml filipin III was used. Images were taken with a FluoViewTM FV1000 (Olympus) confocal microscope using a 63 × 1.35 NA oil immersion objective. Confocal images for all time-points were converted to 16-bit TIFF hyperstacks comprising 3-channels, which correspond to DAPI (nuclear stain, blue), anti-ErbB3-Alexa 488 (ErbB3-positive vesicle marker, green) and phalloidin (cell boundary marker, red). Each channel was subjected to isodata thresholding and binary hole filling to generate contiguous masks of nuclei, ErbB3-positive vesicles and cells. Watershed segmentation was applied to separate vesicles by limiting maximum region diameter to 400 nm. Similarly, cells were segmented by limiting the maximum region diameter to 30 μm. Object detection was performed on each channel to determine the centroids and extent of nuclei, vesicles and the extent of cells. Nuclei and vesicles were assigned to belong to specific cells if the respective centroids were located within the convex hull of the cell. Vesicles were further assigned to be within the nucleus if the centroids were located within the convex hull of the nucleus. The distances between all vesicle centroids and the parent nucleus centroids were calculated. The proportion of the nuclear diameter relative to the cell diameter was then determined. Histograms of vesicle frequency against the location over relative nuclear/cellular diameter were generated. The histograms represent the number of vesicles and their location inside the cell relative to the cell and nuclear boundaries. Approximately 10 Mio cells were lysed in ice-cold 800 μl RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4 containing protease/phosphatase inhibitors). Immunoprecipitations were done using 800 μg of protein sample incubated with the appropriate antibody coupled to either protein A or protein G Dynabeads (both Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions rotating at 4 °C. On the next day, immunocomplexes were separated with a magnet and washed 3× with 200 μl of TBS containing 10% glycerol. Proteins were eluted by boiling in 25 μl 2× loading buffer (Bio-Rad). Proteins were separated with a magnet, and supernatants subsequently analyzed by immunoblotting. The following antibodies were used for immunoprecipitations: ErbB3 (Abcam), importin β1, clathrin (both BD Biosciences), NUP358, RNA polymerase (both Bethyl Laboratories), and dynamin (Calbiochem), in addition to control isotype antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Chromatin precipitation was done as described previously (13Narita M. Narita M. Krizhanovsky V. Nuñez S. Chicas A. Hearn S.A. Myers M.P. Lowe S.W.

Harvested cells were incubated with ice-cold cell lysis buffer (0.34 m sucrose, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol 1 mm DTT in 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0 supplemented with protease/phosphatase inhibitors). After centrifugation at 1300 × g, nuclear pellets were washed with cell lysis buffer lacking Triton X-100 and resuspended in nuclei lysis buffer (3 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT supplemented with protease/phosphatase inhibitors). Chromatin was obtained by centrifugation at 1300 × g. For immunoblot analysis, chromatin fractions were sonicated in nuclei lysis buffer. The cytosolic part of human ErbB3 (gift from A. Ullrich laboratory) was cloned into the N-SF-TAP tag vector using the restriction sites, NheI and XbaI (gift from M. Ueffing laboratory (14Gloeckner C.J. Boldt K. Schumacher A. Roepman R. Ueffing M. A novel tandem affinity purification strategy for the efficient isolation and characterisation of native protein complexes.Proteomics. 2007; 7: 4228-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar)). HEK 293T cells were transfected with the resulting plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h of expression, affinity precipitations were prepared analogous to the co-immunoprecipitation experiments, but with MagStrep beads (IBA-Lifesciences). Precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting. For the liver regeneration model, 1.6 g/kg body weight CCl4 in olive oil was administered via intraperitoneal injection into C57BL/6N mice (Charles River). After 1 day, liver was excised and fixed in 4% PFA for 48 h at 4 °C. Other tissues were collected and prepared from C57BL/6N and pregnant CD1 control mice. For ErbB3 immunostaining in carcinomas, formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue was used. Breast carcinomas were available from a cohort of node-negative patients that was previously described (15Schmidt M. Böhm D. von Törne C. Steiner E. Puhl A. Pilch H. Lehr H.A. Hengstler J.G. Kölbl H.

Antigen was retrieved by boiling in 10 mm citrate buffer, pH 6.0 for 3 × 7 min and subsequent peroxidase activity was quenched by treatment with hydrogen peroxide (3%) in methanol for 15 min at room temperature. After rinsing the slices 3× with PBS, blocking solution (5% swine serum (Vector Laboratories), 3% BSA, 0.1% Tween in PBS) was added overnight at 4 °C. Endogenous avidin and biotin were blocked with the avidin-biotin-blocking kit (Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Incubation with ErbB3 antibody (Ab-21510–2; 1:50, Signalway) in staining buffer (1% swine serum, 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween in PBS) was done overnight at 4 °C. After washing 3× with PBS-T (PBS containing 0.5% Tween), the horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (1:25; Dako) was incubated in staining buffer for 2 h at room temperature. After washing 3× with PBS-T, samples were developed with diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate (Vector Labs) for 1–5 min. Slides were washed with PBS and counter-stained with hematoxylin (Merck), dehydrated through graded ethanol steps, and embedded with entellan (Merck). Images were taken with a BX41 microscope (Olympus). To produce acidified medium, bicarbonate-free DMEM/F12 medium was supplemented with 20 mm MES and adjusted to the indicated pH. Cells were incubated for 1 h in the acidified medium. The hypoxia experiment was done in a cell incubator set to 1% O2 using DMEM/F12 medium that was deoxygenized immediately before use. Cells were kept under these conditions for 16 and 24 h. In the ATP depletion experiment, a medium change with glucose-free DMEM/F12 containing 2.5 μm oligomycin B (Applichem) and 6 mm 2-deoxyglucose (Sigma) was done and maintained for the indicated time. For all conditions, cells were fractionated and analyzed by immunoblotting. Nuclear localization of ErbB3 was investigated in the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, T47D and BT474. Immunocytochemistry followed by confocal imaging showed ErbB3 localized in the nuclei of MCF-7 and T47D cells (Fig. 1A), which increased after heregulin (HRG) stimulation. To confirm the immunohistochemistry results, we isolated nuclear fractions and performed Western blot analysis to localize ErbB3. Nuclear ErbB3 was detected along with validated nuclear marker, histone H3 thus confirming its nuclear localization in the investigated cell lines (Fig. 1, B and C). T47D and BT474 cells showed nuclear ErbB3 even in the absence of HRG stimulation; whereas, MCF-7 cells displayed almost no nuclear localization of ErbB3 prior to HRG stimulation. Despite the differences in basal nuclear ErbB3 expression, all three cell lines showed a clear increase in nuclear localized ErbB3 in response to HRG. The total nuclear ErbB3 level was associated with its phosphorylation state after stimulation with HRG (Fig. 1C). The BT474 cells are known to express high ErbB2 levels, which lead to ligand-independent activation of ErbB3 (18Citri A. Skaria K.B. Yarden Y. The deaf and the dumb: the biology of ErbB-2 and ErbB-3.Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 54-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The enhanced phosphorylation and concomitant increased nuclear translocation of ErbB3 observed in these cells are likely due to ErbB2-mediated trans-phosphorylation and are therefore not significantly affected by HRG stimulation. ErbB3 was found as a full-length molecule in the nuclear fractions, with a molecular mass of ∼185 kDa (Fig. 1D), ruling out that the nuclear fraction of ErbB3 represents truncated versions or alternative isoforms of the protein. To directly observe ErbB3 nuclear trafficking in real time, fluorescently labeled HRG (HRG488) was used for live cell imaging in T47D cells. After the addition of HRG488, fluorescent vesicles accumulated within minutes around the perinuclear region, and a fraction of which entered the nucleus (Fig. 1E, video1.avi, video2.avi). Because of its impaired kinase activity, ErbB3 depends on heterodimerization for activation, mediated by its ligand HRG. In response to HRG stimulation, ErbB2 has been shown to be the preferred ErbB3 dimerization partner (19Holbro T. Beerli R.R. Maurer F. Koziczak M. Barbas 3rd, C.F. Hynes N.E. The ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimer functions as an oncogenic unit: ErbB2 requires ErbB3 to drive breast tumor cell proliferation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 8933-8938Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). To identify ligands able to trigger ErbB3 nuclear translocation and the contribution of dimerization partners, different growth factors of the EGFR family were tested. ErbB3 nuclear translocation in T47D cells was triggered by its ligand HRG in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1F), but not by any of the other tested growth factors of the EGFR family, such as amphiregulin (AR), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and transforming growth factor (TGFα) (Fig. 2A). EGFR had been included as a control of the used growth factors. To study the relevance of the activation state of ErbB3 for nuclear translocation, T47D cells were incubated with lapatinib, which inhibits the kinase activity of EGFR and ErbB2, thus preventing cross-phosphorylation of ErbB3. Both ErbB3 phosphorylation and HRG-induced nuclear translocation were blocked by lapatinib (Fig. 2B), establishing a clear relationship between nuclear translocation and the phosphorylation state of ErbB3. Similarly, lapatinib treatment also blocked nuclear translocation of ErbB3 in BT474 cells (data not shown), underscoring its dependence on receptor phosphorylation. To confirm that nuclear translocation of ErbB3 is indeed mediated by trans-phosphorylation by other RTKs, we inhibited the dimerization of ErbB3 with its preferred partner ErbB2 using pertuzumab, a therapeutic antibody against ErbB2 (20Franklin M.C. Carey K.D. Vajdos F.F. Leahy D.J. de Vos A.M. Sliwkowski M.X. Insights into ErbB signaling from the structure of the ErbB2-pertuzumab complex.Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 317-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). As with lapatinib, pertuzumab inhibited ErbB3 phosphorylation, and completely blocked its nuclear translocation after HRG stimulation (Fig. 2C). To track ErbB3 phosphorylated at the plasma membrane, we utilized surface protein labeling with biotin in T47D cells. The location of surface-labeled ErbB3 was investigated over time using Western blot analysis. Biotin-labeled ErbB3 was detected in nuclear fractions as early as 1 min after stimulation with HRG, which correlated with the phosphorylation of the receptor in the cytosol (Fig. 2D). Nuclear ErbB3 levels peaked at 15 min, and gradually decreased over the next 90 min. Analysis of the nuclear fraction for EGFR or ErbB2 showed that ErbB2 levels but not EGFR levels, increased in the nucleus along with ErbB3 (Fig. 2E). Alternatively, stimulation with EGF instead of HRG, led to an increase in the nuclear translocation of EGFR and ErbB2, but not ErbB3. Together, these results show that ErbB3 co-migrates to the nucleus with ErbB2 following ligand-specific stimulation and phosphorylation. To identify the pathway by which the ErbB3-loaded vesicles are derived, we investigated clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent endocytosis as common mechanisms for transmembrane receptor internalization (21Kumari S. Mg S. Mayor S. Endocytosis unplugged: multiple ways to enter the cell.Cell Res. 2010; 20: 256-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Pharmaceutical inhibition with chlorpromazine: an inhibitor of clathrin-dependent endocytosis (22Wang L.H. Rothberg K.G. Anderson R.G.

Following surface-biotinylation and HRG-stimulation, biotinylated ErbB3 was tracked in the nuclear and cytosolic fractions of T47D cells.

Peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) prediction from the six-minute step test (6MST) has not been established for sedentary females. It is recognized that lower-limb muscle strength and power play a key role during functional activities. The aim of this study was to investigate cardiorespiratory responses during the 6MST and CPX and to develop a predictive equation to estimate VO2peak in both lean and obese subjects. Additionally we aim to investigate how muscle function impacts functional performance. Lean (LN = 13) and obese (OB = 18) women, aged 20-45, underwent a CPX, two 6MSTs, and isokinetic and isometric knee extensor strength and power evaluations. Regression analysis assessed the ability to predict VO2peak from the 6MST, age and body mass index (BMI). CPX and 6MST main outcomes were compared between LN and OB and correlated with strength and power variables. CRF, functional capacity, and muscle strength and power were lower in the OB compared to LN (<0.05). During the 6MST, LN and OB reached ~90% of predicted maximal heart rate and ~80% of the VO2peak obtained during CPX. BMI, age and number of step cycles (NSC) explained 83% of the total variance in VO2peak. Moderate to strong correlations between VO2peak at CPX and VO2peak at 6MST (r = 0.86), VO2peak at CPX and NSC (r = 0.80), as well as between VO2peak, NSC and muscle strength and power variables were found (p<0.05). These findings indicate the 6MST, BMI and age accurately predict VO2peak in both lean and obese young sedentary women. Muscle strength and power were related to measures of aerobic and functional performance."
https://openalex.org/W2286918718,"Besides its crucial role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, the knowledge of amyloid precursor protein (APP) physiologic functions remains surprisingly scarce. Here, we show that APP regulates the transcription of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). APP-dependent regulation of GDNF expression affects muscle strength, muscular trophy, and both neuronal and muscular differentiation fundamental for neuromuscular junction (NMJ) maturation in vivo. In a nerve-muscle coculture model set up to modelize NMJ formation in vitro, silencing of muscular APP induces a 30% decrease in secreted GDNF levels and a 40% decrease in the total number of NMJs together with a significant reduction in the density of acetylcholine vesicles at the presynaptic site and in neuronal maturation. These defects are rescued by GDNF expression in muscle cells in the conditions where muscular APP has been previously silenced. Expression of GDNF in muscles of amyloid precursor protein null mice corrected the aberrant synaptic morphology of NMJs. Our findings highlight for the first time that APP-dependent GDNF expression drives the process of NMJ formation, providing new insights into the link between APP gene regulatory network and physiologic functions.—Stanga, S., Zanou, N., Audouard, E., Tasiaux, B., Contino, S., Vandermeulen, G., René, F., Loeffler, J.-P., Clotman, F., Gailly, P., Dewachter, I., Octave, J.-N., Kienlen-Campard, P.

https://openalex.org/W2207884494,"Acinar cells of the exocrine pancreas are tasked with synthesizing, packaging and secreting vast quantities of pro-digestive enzymes to maintain proper metabolic homeostasis for the organism. Because the synthesis of high levels of hydrolases is potentially dangerous, the pancreas is prone to acute pancreatitis (AP), a disease that targets acinar cells, leading to acinar-ductal metaplasia (ADM), inflammation and fibrosis—events that can transition into the earliest stages of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Despite a wealth of information concerning the broad phenotype associated with pancreatitis, little is understood regarding specific transcriptional regulatory networks that are susceptible to AP and the role these networks play in acinar cell and exocrine pancreas responses. In this study, we examined the importance of the acinar-specific maturation transcription factor MIST1 to AP damage and organ recovery. Analysis of wild-type and Mist1 conditional null mice revealed that Mist1 gene transcription and protein accumulation were dramatically reduced as acinar cells underwent ADM alterations during AP episodes. To test if loss of MIST1 function was primarily responsible for the damaged status of the organ, mice harboring a Cre-inducible Mist1 transgene (iMist1) were utilized to determine if sustained MIST1 activity could alleviate AP damage responses. Unexpectedly, constitutive iMist1 expression during AP led to a dramatic increase in organ damage followed by acinar cell death. We conclude that the transient silencing of Mist1 expression is critical for acinar cells to survive an AP episode, providing cells an opportunity to suppress their secretory function and regenerate damaged cells. The importance of MIST1 to these events suggests that modulating key pancreas transcription networks could ease clinical symptoms in patients diagnosed with pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2204919286,"Lichens are valuable bio-indicators for evaluating the consequences of human activities that are increasingly changing the earth’s ecosystems. Since a major objective of national parks is the preservation of biodiversity, our aim is to analyse how natural resource management, the availability of lichen substrates and environmental parameters influence lichen diversity in Rodnei Mountains National Park situated in the Eastern Carpathians. Three main types of managed vegetation were investigated: the transhumance systems in alpine meadows, timber exploitation in mixed and pure spruce forests, and the corresponding conserved sites. The data were sampled following a replicated design. For the analysis, we considered not only all lichen species, but also species groups from different substrates such as soil, trees and deadwood. The lichen diversity was described according to species richness, red-list status and substrate-specialist species richness. The variation in species composition was related to the environmental variables. Habitat management was found to negatively influence species richness and alter the lichen community composition, particularly for threatened and substrate-specialist species. It reduced the mean level of threatened species richness by 59%, when all lichen species were considered, and by 81%, when only epiphytic lichens were considered. Management-induced disturbance significantly decreased lichen species richness in forest landscapes with long stand continuity. The diversity patterns of the lichens indicate a loss of species richness and change in species composition in areas where natural resources are still exploited inside the borders of the national park. It is thus imperative for protected areas, in particular old-growth forests and alpine meadows, to receive more protection than they have received in the past to ensure populations of the characteristic species remain viable in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2219331741,"The present study aimed to investigate gender differences in the emotional evaluation of 18 film clips divided into six categories: Erotic, Scenery, Neutral, Sadness, Compassion, and Fear. 41 female and 40 male students rated all clips for valence-pleasantness, arousal, level of elicited distress, anxiety, jittery feelings, excitation, and embarrassment. Analysis of positive films revealed higher levels of arousal, pleasantness, and excitation to the Scenery clips in both genders, but lower pleasantness and greater embarrassment in women compared to men to Erotic clips. Concerning unpleasant stimuli, unlike men, women reported more unpleasantness to the Compassion, Sadness, and Fear compared to the Neutral clips and rated them also as more arousing than did men. They further differentiated the films by perceiving greater arousal to Fear than to Compassion clips. Women rated the Sadness and Fear clips with greater Distress and Jittery feelings than men did. Correlation analysis between arousal and the other emotional scales revealed that, although men looked less aroused than women to all unpleasant clips, they also showed a larger variance in their emotional responses as indicated by the high number of correlations and their relatively greater extent, an outcome pointing to a masked larger sensitivity of part of male sample to emotional clips. We propose a new perspective in which gender difference in emotional responses can be better evidenced by means of film clips selected and clustered in more homogeneous categories, controlled for arousal levels, as well as evaluated through a number of emotion focused adjectives."

https://openalex.org/W2280854166,"Inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy (DR). We have previously reported increased monocyte (Mono) trafficking into the retinas of diabetic animals. In this study, we have examined the effect of activated Monos on retinal endothelial cells (ECs). The U937 Mϕ-conditioned medium (CM) significantly decreased the transendothelial resistance of EC monolayers as measured by electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (P= 0.007). The CM was fractioned, and the effective fraction (30-100 kDa) was analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and cathepsin D (CD) was identified as a major secreted product. Immunoprecipitated CD resulted in decreased resistance in ECs (P= 0.006). The specificity of CD in mediating alterations of the EC barrier was confirmed using small interfering RNA. The decreased resistance correlated with a significantly increased gap between ECs. CD altered the Ras homolog gene family, member A/Rho-associated kinase pathway with increased stress actin filament formation in the EC layer. Increased CD levels were found in the retinas of diabetic mice (3-fold) and serum samples of patients with diabetic macular edema (1.6-fold) measured by Western blot and ELISA. These findings suggest an important role for Mϕ-derived CD in altering the blood-retinal barrier and reveal a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of DR.-Monickaraj, F., McGuire, P.

In this study, we aimed to explore, both in vitro and in human vascular tissue, expression of the NO-transporting transmembrane pore aquaporin-1 (AQP1) and its regulation by atheroprotective KLF2 and atherogenic inflammatory stimuli. In silico analysis of gene expression profiles from studies that assessed the effects of KLF2 overexpression in vitro and atherosclerosis in vivo on endothelial cells, identifies AQP1 as KLF2 downstream gene with elevated expression in the plaque-free vessel wall. Biomechanical and pharmaceutical induction of KLF2 in vitro is accompanied by induction of AQP1. Chromosome immunoprecipitation (CHIP) confirms binding of KLF2 to the AQP1 promoter. Inflammatory stimulation of endothelial cells leads to repression of AQP1 transcription, which is restrained by KLF2 overexpression. Immunohistochemistry reveals expression of aquaporin-1 in non-activated endothelium overlying macrophage-poor intimae, irrespective whether these intimae are characterized as being plaque-free or as containing advanced plaque. We conclude that AQP1 expression is subject to KLF2-mediated positive regulation by atheroprotective shear stress and is downregulated under inflammatory conditions both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, endothelial expression of AQP1 characterizes the atheroprotected, non-inflamed vessel wall. Our data provide support for a continuous role of KLF2 in stabilizing the vessel wall via co-temporal expression of eNOS and AQP1 both preceding and during the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2211947790,"Phorbol esters, which are protein kinase C (PKC) activators, and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, which cause enhanced acetylation of cellular proteins, are the main classes of chemical inducers of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lytic cycle in latently EBV-infected cells acting through the PKC pathway. Chemical inducers which induce EBV lytic cycle through alternative cellular pathways may aid in defining the mechanisms leading to lytic cycle reactivation and improve cells’ responsiveness towards lytic induction. We performed a phenotypic screening on a chemical library of 50,240 novel small organic compounds to identify novel class(es) of strong inducer(s) of EBV lytic cycle in gastric carcinoma (GC) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells. Five hit compounds were selected after three successive rounds of increasingly stringent screening. All five compounds are structurally diverse from each other and distinct from phorbol esters or HDAC inhibitors. They neither cause hyperacetylation of histone proteins nor significant PKC activation at their working concentrations, suggesting that their biological mode of action are distinct from that of the known chemical inducers. Two of the five compounds with rapid lytic-inducing action were further studied for their mechanisms of induction of EBV lytic cycle. Unlike HDAC inhibitors, lytic induction by both compounds was not inhibited by rottlerin, a specific inhibitor of PKCδ. Interestingly, both compounds could cooperate with HDAC inhibitors to enhance EBV lytic cycle induction in EBV-positive epithelial cancer cells, paving way for the development of strategies to increase cells’ responsiveness towards lytic reactivation. One of the two compounds bears structural resemblance to iron chelators and the other strongly activates the MAPK pathways. These structurally diverse novel organic compounds may represent potential new classes of chemicals that can be used to investigate any alternative mechanism(s) leading to EBV lytic cycle reactivation from latency."
https://openalex.org/W2199297994,"Survival and predation of snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) has been widely studied, yet there has been little quantification of the changes in vulnerability of hares to specific predators that may result from seasonal changes in vegetation and cover. We investigated survival and causes of mortalities of snowshoe hares during the late increase, peak, and decline of a population in interior Alaska. From June 2008 to May 2012, we radio-tagged 288 adult and older juvenile hares in early successional and black spruce (Picea mariana) forests and, using known-fate methods in program MARK, evaluated 85 survival models that included variables for sex, age, and body condition of hares, as well as trapping site, month, season, year, snowfall, snow depth, and air temperature. We compared the models using Akaike's information criterion with correction for small sample size. Model results indicated that month, capture site, and body condition were the most important variables in explaining survival rates. Survival was highest in July, and more generally during summer, when alternative prey was available to predators of hares. Low survival rates coincided with molting periods, breeding activity in the spring, and the introduction of juveniles to the sample population in the fall. We identified predation as the cause of mortality in 86% of hare deaths. When the source of predation could be determined, hares were killed more often by goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) than other predators in early successional forest (30%), and more often by lynx (Lynx canadensis) than other predators in black spruce forest (31%). Great horned owls (Bubo virginianus) and coyotes (Canis latrans) represented smaller proportions of hare predation, and non-predatory causes were a minor source (3%) of mortality. Because hares rely on vegetative cover for concealment from predators, we measured cover in predation sites and habitats that the hares occupied and concluded that habitat type had a greater influence on the sources of predation than the amount of cover in any given location within a habitat. Our observations illustrate the vulnerability of hares to predators in even the densest coniferous habitat available in the boreal forest, and indicate strong seasonal changes in the rates and sources of predation."
https://openalex.org/W2212220960,"Multiple, action-based space representations are each based on the extent to which action is possible toward a specific sector of space, such as near/reachable and far/unreachable. Studies on tool-use revealed how the boundaries between these representations are dynamic. Space is not only multidimensional and dynamic, but it is also known for interacting with other dimensions of magnitude, such as time. However, whether time operates on similar action-driven multiple representations and whether it can be modulated by tool-use is yet unknown. To address these issues, healthy participants performed a time bisection task in two spatial positions (near and far space) before and after an active tool-use training, which consisted of performing goal-directed actions holding a tool with their right hand (Experiment 1). Before training, perceived stimuli duration was influenced by their spatial position defined by action. Hence, a dissociation emerged between near/reachable and far/unreachable space. Strikingly, this dissociation disappeared after the active tool-use training since temporal stimuli were now perceived as nearer. The remapping was not found when a passive tool-training was executed (Experiment 2) or when the active tool-training was performed with participants' left hand (Experiment 3). Moreover, no time remapping was observed following an equivalent active hand-training but without a tool (Experiment 4). Taken together, our findings reveal that time processing is based on action-driven multiple representations. The dynamic nature of these representations is demonstrated by the remapping of time, which is action- and effector-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W2220948796,"Background Rapid easy-to-use HIV tests offer opportunities to increase HIV testing among populations at risk of infection. We used the OraQuick Rapid HIV-1/2 antibody test (OraQuick) in the Bangkok Tenofovir Study, an HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis trial among people who inject drugs. Methods The Bangkok Tenofovir Study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. We tested participants’ oral fluid for HIV using OraQuick monthly and blood using a nucleic-acid amplification test (NAAT) every 3 months. We used Kaplan-Meier methods to estimate the duration from a positive HIV NAAT until the mid-point between the last non-reactive and first reactive oral fluid test and proportional hazards to examine factors associated with the time until the test was reactive. Results We screened 3678 people for HIV using OraQuick. Among 447 with reactive results, 436 (97.5%) were confirmed HIV-infected, 10 (2.2%) HIV-uninfected, and one (0.2%) had indeterminate results. Two participants with non-reactive OraQuick results were, in fact, HIV-infected at screening yielding 99.5% sensitivity, 99.7% specificity, a 97.8% positive predictive value, and a 99.9% negative predictive value. Participants receiving tenofovir took longer to develop a reactive OraQuick (191.8 days) than participants receiving placebo (16.8 days) (p = 0.02) and participants infected with HIV CRF01_AE developed a reactive OraQuick earlier than participants infected with other subtypes (p = 0.04). Discussion The oral fluid HIV test performed well at screening, suggesting it can be used when rapid results and non-invasive tools are preferred. However, participants receiving tenofovir took longer to develop a reactive oral fluid test result than those receiving placebo. Thus, among people using pre-exposure prophylaxis, a blood-based HIV test may be an appropriate choice. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00119106."
https://openalex.org/W2237777538,"Cholesterol metabolism is subject to complex transcriptional and nontranscriptional regulation. Herein, the role of ubiquitylation is emerging as an important post-translational modification that regulates cholesterol synthesis and uptake. Similar to other post-translational modifications, ubiquitylation is reversible in a process dependent on activity of deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs). Yet whether these play a role in cholesterol metabolism is largely unknown. As a first step to test this possibility, we used pharmacological inhibition of cellular DUB activity. Short term (2 h) inhibition of DUBs resulted in accumulation of high molecular weight ubiquitylated proteins. This was accompanied by a dramatic decrease in abundance of the LDLR and attenuated LDL uptake into hepatic cells. Importantly, this occurred in the absence of changes in the mRNA levels of the LDLR or other SREBP2-regulated genes, in line with this phenotype being a post-transcriptional event. Mechanistically, we identify transcriptional induction of the E3 ubiquitin ligase IDOL in human and rodent cells as the underlying cause for ubiquitylation-dependent lysosomal degradation of the LDLR following DUB inhibition. In contrast to the established transcriptional regulation of IDOL by the sterol-responsive liver X receptor (LXR) transcription factors, induction of IDOL by DUB inhibition is LXR-independent and occurs in Lxrαβ(-/-) MEFs. Consistent with the role of DUBs in transcriptional regulation, we identified a 70-bp region in the proximal promoter of IDOL, distinct from that containing the LXR-responsive element, which mediates the response to DUB inhibition. In conclusion, we identify a sterol-independent mechanism to regulate IDOL expression and IDOL-mediated lipoprotein receptor degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2208644450,"Background Accurate evaluation of immunostained histological images is required for reproducible research in many different areas and forms the basis of many clinical decisions. The quality and efficiency of histopathological evaluation is limited by the information content of a histological image, which is primarily encoded as perceivable contrast differences between objects in the image. However, the colors of chromogen and counterstain used for histological samples are not always optimally distinguishable, even under optimal conditions. Methods and Results In this study, we present a method to extract the bivariate color map inherent in a given histological image and to retrospectively optimize this color map. We use a novel, unsupervised approach based on color deconvolution and principal component analysis to show that the commonly used blue and brown color hues in Hematoxylin—3,3’-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) images are poorly suited for human observers. We then demonstrate that it is possible to construct improved color maps according to objective criteria and that these color maps can be used to digitally re-stain histological images. Validation To validate whether this procedure improves distinguishability of objects and background in histological images, we re-stain phantom images and N = 596 large histological images of immunostained samples of human solid tumors. We show that perceptual contrast is improved by a factor of 2.56 in phantom images and up to a factor of 2.17 in sets of histological tumor images. Context Thus, we provide an objective and reliable approach to measure object distinguishability in a given histological image and to maximize visual information available to a human observer. This method could easily be incorporated in digital pathology image viewing systems to improve accuracy and efficiency in research and diagnostics."

It is less clear whether socioeconomic health inequalities differ across age groups by other factors that are known to affect the relation between socioeconomic position and health, like the indicator of socioeconomic position, the health outcome, gender, and as to whether socioeconomic health inequalities are measured in absolute or in relative terms. The aim is to investigate whether absolute and relative socioeconomic health inequalities differ across age groups by indicator of socioeconomic position, health outcome and gender.The study sample was derived from the baseline measurement of the LifeLines Cohort Study and consisted of 95,432 participants. Socioeconomic position was measured as educational level and household income. Physical and mental health were measured with the RAND-36. Age concerned eleven 5-years age groups. Absolute inequalities were examined by comparing means. Relative inequalities were examined by comparing Gini-coefficients. Analyses were performed for both health outcomes by both educational level and household income. Analyses were performed for all age groups, and stratified by gender.Absolute and relative socioeconomic health inequalities differed across age groups by indicator of socioeconomic position, health outcome, and gender. Absolute inequalities were most pronounced for mental health by household income. They were larger in younger than older age groups. Relative inequalities were most pronounced for physical health by educational level. Gini-coefficients were largest in young age groups and smallest in older age groups.Absolute and relative socioeconomic health inequalities differed cross-sectionally across age groups by indicator of socioeconomic position, health outcome and gender. Researchers should critically consider the implications of choosing a specific age group, in addition to the indicator of socioeconomic position and health outcome, as findings on socioeconomic health inequalities may differ between them."
https://openalex.org/W2201044037,"Altered expression of miRNAs has been observed in many types of cancer, including breast cancer, and shown to contribute to cancer growth, aggressiveness, and response to therapies. In this pilot study, we investigated the possible correlation of miRNAs with risk of recurrence of estrogen receptor positive, lymph node-negative mammary carcinomas as determined by the Oncotype DX® Breast Cancer assay. To accomplish this, we extracted RNA from a collection of breast carcinomas that had previously been analyzed by Oncotype DX®. Multiple Let-7 family members were negatively correlated with the recurrence score (RS), which is consistent with their tumor suppressor properties. Additional miRNAs were found to positively correlate with RS, including miR-377-5p, miR-633b, miR-548t and miR-3648. Pathway analysis of putative and validated targets suggests that these miRNAs may have a diverse range of functions that may contribute to tumor recurrence. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that a miRNA expression signature can be developed to aid existing methods to determine the risk of recurrence for women with estrogen receptor positive breast cancers treated with endocrine therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2216260316,"Previously, transplantation of ovaries from young, cycling mice into old, postreproductive-age mice increased life span and decreased cardiomyopathy at death. We anticipated that the same factors that increased life span and decreased cardiomyopathy could also influence the progression of orthopedic disease. At 11 months of age, prepubertally ovariectomized and ovary-intact mice (including reproductively cycling and acyclic mice) received new 60-day-old ovaries. At death, epiphyseal bone in the proximal tibia and the distal femur and mid-shaft tibial and femoral diaphyseal bone was analyzed with micro-computed tomography. For qualitative analysis of osteophytosis, we also included mineralized connective tissue within the stifle joint. Prepubertal ovariectomy had the greatest influence on bone volume, ovarian transplantation had the greatest influence on bone architecture and both treatments influenced bone density. Ovarian transplantation increased cortical, but not trabecular bone density and tended to increase osteophytosis and heterotopic mineralization, except in acyclic recipients. These effects may have been dictated by the timing of the treatments, with ovariectomy appearing to influence early development and ovarian transplantation limited to influencing only the postreproductive period. However, major differences observed between cycling, acyclic and ovariectomized recipients of new ovaries may have been, in part due to differences in the levels of hormone receptors present and the responsiveness of specific bone processes to hormone signaling. Changes that resulted from these treatments may represent a compensatory response to normal age-associated, negative, orthopedic changes. Alternatively, differences between treatments may simply be the 'preservation' of unblemished orthopedic conditions, prior to the influence of negative, age-associated effects. These findings may suggest that in women, tailoring hormone replacement therapy to the patient's current reproductive status may improve therapy effectiveness and that beginning therapy earlier may help preserve trabecular bone mineral density that would otherwise be lost during perimenopause."
https://openalex.org/W2204551782,"Huanglonbing (HLB) is one of the most destructive disease affecting citrus plants. The causal agent is associated with the phloem-limited bacterium Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas) and the psyllid Diaphorina citri, vector of disease, that transmits the bacterium associated with HLB. The control of disease can be achieved by suppressing either the bacterium or the vector. Among the control strategies for HLB disease, one of the widely used consists in controlling the enzymes of the disease vector, Diaphorina citri. The insect Diaphorina citri belongs to the order Hemiptera, which frequently have cysteine peptidases in the gut. The importance of this class of enzymes led us to search for enzymes in the D. citri transcriptome for the establishment of alternatives strategies for HLB control. In this study, we reported the identification and characterization of a cathepsin B-like cysteine peptidase from D. citri (DCcathB). DCcathB was recombinantly expressed in Pichia pastoris, presenting a molecular mass of approximately 50 kDa. The enzyme hydrolyzed the fluorogenic substrate Z-F-R-AMC (Km = 23.5 μM) and the selective substrate for cathepsin B, Z-R-R-AMC (Km = 6.13 μM). The recombinant enzyme was inhibited by the cysteine protease inhibitors E64 (IC50 = 0.014 μM) and CaneCPI-4 (Ki = 0.05 nM) and by the selective cathepsin B inhibitor CA-074 (IC50 = 0.095 nM). RT-qPCR analysis revealed that the expression of the DCcathB in nymph and adult was approximately 9-fold greater than in egg. Moreover, the expression of this enzyme in the gut was 175-fold and 3333-fold higher than in the remaining tissues and in the head, respectively, suggesting that DCcathB can be a target for HLB control."
https://openalex.org/W2220874734,"5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA), a precursor of porphyrin, is specifically converted to the fluorescent substance protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in tumors to be used as a prodrug for photodynamic therapy and diagnosis. Hypoxia, a common feature of solid tumors, decreases the efficacy of ALA-based photodynamic therapy and diagnosis. This decrease results from the excretion of porphyrin precursor coproporphyrinogen III (CPgenIII), an intermediate in the biosynthesis of PpIX. However, the mechanism of CPgenIII excretion during hypoxia remains unclear. In this study, we revealed the importance of mitochondrial respiration for the production of PpIX during hypoxia. Porphyrin concentrations were estimated in human gastric cancer cell lines by HPLC. Expression levels of porphyrin biosynthesis genes were measured by qRT-PCR and immunoblotting. Blockage of porphyrin biosynthesis was an oxygen-dependent phenomenon resulting from decreased PpIX production in mitochondria under hypoxic conditions. PpIX production was increased by the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration complexes, which indicates that the enzymes of porphyrin biosynthesis compete with respiration complexes for molecular oxygen. Our results indicate that targeting the respiration complexes is a rationale for enhancing the effect of ALA-mediated treatment and diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2208094753,"When modelling the emergence of weeds, two main factors are considered that condition this process: temperature and soil moisture. Optimum temperature is necessary for metabolic processes that generate energy for growth, while turgor pressure is necessary for root and shoot elongation which eventually leads to seedling emergence from the soil. Most emergence models do not usually consider light as a residual factor, but it could have an important role as it can alter directly or indirectly the dormancy and germination of seeds. In this paper, inclusion of light as an additional factor to photoperiod and radiation in emergence models is explored and compared with the classical hydrothermal time (HTT) model using Camelina microcarpa as an example. HTT based on hourly estimates is also compared with that based on daily estimates. Results suggest that, although HTT based models are accurate enough for local applications, the precision of these models is improved when HTT is estimated hourly and solar radiation is included as a factor."
https://openalex.org/W2219376193,"The actin-depolymerizing factor/cofilin (ADF/CFL) gene family encodes a diverse group of relatively small proteins. Once known strictly as modulators of actin filament dynamics, recent research has demonstrated that these proteins are involved in a variety of cellular processes, from signal transduction to the cytonuclear trafficking of actin. In both plant and animal lineages, expression patterns of paralogs in the ADF/CFL gene family vary among tissue types and developmental stages. In this study we use computational approaches to investigate the evolutionary forces responsible for the diversification of the ADF/CFL gene family. Estimating the rate of non-synonymous to synonymous mutations (dN/dS) across phylogenetic lineages revealed that the majority of ADF/CFL codon positions were under strong purifying selection, with rare episodic events of accelerated protein evolution. In both plants and animals these instances of accelerated evolution were ADF/CFL subclass specific, and all of the sites under selection were located in regions of the protein that could serve in new functional roles. We suggest these sites may have been important in the functional diversification of ADF/CFL proteins."

Epigenetic modifications, including methylation of the CpG islands contribute to the regulation of viral gene expression. The present study investigates the effects of spontaneous age dependent loss of hepatitis B surface protein- (HBs) expression due to HBV-genome specific methylation as well as its proximate positive effects in HBs transgenic mice.Liver and serum of HBs transgenic mice aged 5-33 weeks were analyzed by Western blot, immunohistochemistry, serum analysis, PCR, and qRT-PCR.From the third month of age hepatic loss of HBs was observed in 20% of transgenic mice. The size of HBs-free area and the relative number of animals with these effects increased with age and struck about 55% of animals aged 33 weeks. Loss of HBs-expression was strongly correlated with amelioration of serum parameters ALT and AST. In addition lower HBs-expression went on with decreased ER-stress. The loss of surface protein expression started on transcriptional level and appeared to be regulated epigenetically by DNA methylation. The amount of the HBs-expression correlated negatively with methylation of HBV DNA in the mouse genome.Our data suggest that methylation of specific CpG sites controls gene expression even in HBs-transgenic mice with truncated HBV genome. More important, the loss of HBs expression and intracellular aggregation ameliorated cell stress and liver integrity. Thus, targeted modulation of HBs expression may offer new therapeutic approaches. Furthermore, HBs-transgenic mice depict a non-infectious mouse model to study one possible mechanism of HBs gene silencing by hypermethylation."

KLHL12 Promotes Ubiquitination of the Dopamine D4 Receptor on Non-Lysine Residues In previous studies we have shown that KLHL12, a BTB-Kelch protein, specifically interacts with the polymorphic repeats of the dopamine D4 receptor and enhances its ubiquitination, which, however, has no influence on receptor degradation. In this study we provide evidence that KLHL12 promotes ubiquitination of the dopamine D4 receptor on non-lysine residues. By using lysine-deficient receptor mutants and chemical approaches we concluded that ubiquitination on cysteine, serine and/or threonine is possible. Differential Ubiquitination of the Dopamine D4 Receptor Polymorphic Variants Additionally, we show that the dopamine D4.7 receptor variant, which is associated with a predisposition to develop attention deficient hyperactivity disorder, is differentially ubiquitinated compared to the other common receptor variants D4.2 and D4.4. Together, our study suggests that GPCR ubiquitination is a complex and variable process."
https://openalex.org/W2207141051,"Visual adaptation is a powerful tool to probe the short-term plasticity of the visual system. Adapting to local features such as the oriented lines can distort our judgment of subsequently presented lines, the tilt aftereffect. The tilt aftereffect is believed to be processed at the low-level of the visual cortex, such as V1. Adaptation to faces, on the other hand, can produce significant aftereffects in high-level traits such as identity, expression, and ethnicity. However, whether face adaptation necessitate awareness of face features is debatable. In the current study, we investigated whether facial expression aftereffects (FEAE) can be generated by partially visible faces. We first generated partially visible faces using the bubbles technique, in which the face was seen through randomly positioned circular apertures, and selected the bubbled faces for which the subjects were unable to identify happy or sad expressions. When the subjects adapted to static displays of these partial faces, no significant FEAE was found. However, when the subjects adapted to a dynamic video display of a series of different partial faces, a significant FEAE was observed. In both conditions, subjects could not identify facial expression in the individual adapting faces. These results suggest that our visual system is able to integrate unrecognizable partial faces over a short period of time and that the integrated percept affects our judgment on subsequently presented faces. We conclude that FEAE can be generated by partial face with little facial expression cues, implying that our cognitive system fills-in the missing parts during adaptation, or the subcortical structures are activated by the bubbled faces without conscious recognition of emotion during adaptation."

Partitioning and Transmutation (P&T) could be considered as a technological option for the management of highly radioactive waste, therefore a wide study has been conducted. In the study group objectives for P&T and the boundary conditions of the phase out have been discussed. The fulfillment of the given objectives is analyzed from neutronics point of view using simulations of a molten salt reactor with fast neutron spectrum. It is shown that the efficient transmutation of all existing transuranium isotopes would be possible from neutronic point of view in a time frame of about 60 years. For this task three reactors of a mostly new technology would have to be developed and a twofold life cycle consisting of a transmuter operation and a deep burn phase would be required. A basic insight for the optimization of the time duration of the deep burn phase is given. Further on, a detailed balance of different isotopic inventories is given to allow a deeper understanding of the processes during transmutation in the molten salt fast reactor. The effect of modeling and simulation is investigated based on three different modeling strategies and two different code versions."
https://openalex.org/W2196493844,"Targeting protein stability with small molecules has emerged as an effective tool to control protein abundance in a fast, scalable and reversible manner. The technique involves tagging a protein of interest (POI) with a destabilizing domain (DD) specifically controlled by a small molecule. The successful construction of such fusion proteins may, however, be limited by functional interference of the DD epitope with electrostatic interactions required for full biological function of proteins. Another drawback of this approach is the remaining endogenous protein. Here, we combined the Cre-LoxP system with an advanced DD and generated a protein regulation system in which the loss of an endogenous protein, in our case the tumor suppressor PTEN, can be coupled directly with a conditionally fine-tunable DD-PTEN. This new system will consolidate and extend the use of DD-technology to control protein function precisely in living cells and animal models."

Our results show that the vast majority of our subjects did not adopt the default numbers, but their stated strategy was affected by the default. Moreover, we find that our manipulation spilled over to a subsequent repeated public goods game where default was not manipulated. Here we found that subjects who previously saw the free rider default were significantly less cooperative than those who saw the perfect conditional cooperator default."
https://openalex.org/W2225318108,"Understanding the behaviour of opportunistic pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus in their natural human niche holds great medical interest. With the development of sensitive molecular methods and deep-sequencing technology, it is now possible to robustly assess the global transcriptome of bacterial species in their human habitat. However, as the genomes of the colonizing strains are often not available compiling the pan-genome for the species of interest may provide an effective method to reliably and rapidly compile the transcriptome of a bacterial species. The pan-genome of S. aureus and its associated core and accessory components were compiled based on 25 genomes and comprises a total of 65,557 proteins clustering into 4,198 Orthologous Groups (OGs). The generated gene catalogue was used to assign RNAseq-derived sequence reads to S. aureus in a variety of in vitro and in vivo samples. In all cases, the number of reads that could be assigned to S. aureus was greater using the OG database than using a reference genome. Growth of two S. aureus strains in synthetic nasal medium confirmed that both strains experienced strong iron starvation. Traits such as purine metabolism appeared to be more affected in a typical nasal colonizer than in a strain representative of the S. aureus USA300 lineage. Mapping sequencing reads from a metatranscriptome generated from the human anterior nares allowed the identification of genes highly expressed by S. aureus in vivo. The OG database generated in this study represents a useful tool to obtain a snapshot of the functional attributes of S. aureus under different in vitro and in vivo conditions. The approach proved to be advantageous to assign sequencing reads to bacterial strains when RNAseq data is derived from samples where strain information and/or the corresponding genome/s are unavailable."

An adult female A. oxyrinchus, 2500 mm total length and 120 kg wet weight, was accidentally fished on 24 November 2010 near the coast of Gijón, Asturias, Spain. The fish was identified by its morphological pattern as well as by mitochondrial and nuclear DNA analyses. Because the sturgeon was found far away from any known breeding area, it was considered a stray or vagrant specimen. It certainly has a natural origin, but its eventual birthplace could not be determined. Because its current occurrence was unknown in southwestern Europe until now, the species is not cataloged or protected in this area. Therefore, the residual European stocks of A. oxyrinchus ought to be listed as Critically Endangered (CR) according to the IUCN categories. Likewise, it is imperative for southwestern European countries with an historic or recent occurrence of A. oxyrinchus to protect the species through domestic and international legislation. The present sympatric occurrence of A. sturio and A. oxyrinchus raises new challenges about key questions, such as the species selection for restoration program in European countries.

https://openalex.org/W2209179188,"Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription STAT5 is a key mediator of cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. While STAT5 activity is tightly regulated in normal cells, its constitutive activation directly contributes to oncogenesis and is associated with a broad range of hematological and solid tumor cancers. Therefore the development of compounds able to modulate pathogenic activation of this protein is a very challenging endeavor. A crucial step of drug design is the understanding of the protein conformational features and the definition of putative binding site(s) for such modulators. Currently, there is no structural data available for human STAT5 and our study is the first footprint towards the description of structure and dynamics of this protein. We investigated structural and dynamical features of the two STAT5 isoforms, STAT5a and STAT5b, taken into account their phosphorylation status. The study was based on the exploration of molecular dynamics simulations by different analytical methods. Despite the overall folding similarity of STAT5 proteins, the MD conformations display specific structural and dynamical features for each protein, indicating first, sequence-encoded structural properties and second, phosphorylation-induced effects which contribute to local and long-distance structural rearrangements interpreted as allosteric event. Further examination of the dynamical coupling between distant sites provides evidence for alternative profiles of the communication pathways inside and between the STAT5 domains. These results add a new insight to the understanding of the crucial role of intrinsic molecular dynamics in mediating intramolecular signaling in STAT5. Two pockets, localized in close proximity to the phosphotyrosine-binding site and adjacent to the channel for communication pathways across STAT5, may constitute valid targets to develop inhibitors able to modulate the function-related communication properties of this signaling protein."

Assessing the spatial and temporal distributions of marine turtles in an open system poses both observational and analytical challenges due to the turtles' highly migratory nature. Surface counts of marine turtles in waters along the southern part of Florida's east coast were made in and adjacent to the southeast portion of the Florida Current using standard aerial surveys during 2011 and 2012 to assess their seasonal presence. This area is of particular concern for sea turtles as interest increases in offshore energy developments, specifically harnessing the power of the Florida Current. While it is understood that marine turtles use these waters, here we evaluate seasonal variation in sea turtle abundance and density over two years. Density of sea turtles observed within the study area ranged from 0.003 turtles km-2 in the winter of 2011 to 0.064 turtles km-2 in the spring of 2012. This assessment of marine turtles in the waters off southeast Florida quantifies their in-water abundance across seasons in this area to establish baselines and inform future management strategies of these protected species."

Here we observed that in the yeast Hansenula polymorpha Ca2+ deficiency in the secretory pathway caused by Pmr1 inactivation is exacerbated by (i) the ret1-27 mutation affecting COPI-mediated vesicular transport, (ii) inactivation of the vacuolar Ca2+ ATPase Pmc1 and (iii) inactivation of Vps35, which is a component of the retromer complex responsible for protein transport between the vacuole and secretory organelles. The ret1-27 mutation also exerted phenotypes indicating alterations in transport between the vacuole and secretory organelles. These data indicate that ret1-27, pmc1 and vps35 affect a previously unknown Pmr1-independent route of the Ca2+ delivery to the secretory pathway. We also observed that the vacuolar protein carboxypeptidase Y receives additional modifications of its glycoside chains if it escapes the Vps10-dependent sorting to the vacuole."
https://openalex.org/W2220327640,"Protein-protein interactions in Escherichia coli (E. coli) has been studied extensively using high throughput methods such as tandem affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry and yeast two-hybrid method. This can in turn be used to understand the mechanisms of bacterial cellular processes. However, experimental characterization of such huge amount of interactions data is not available for other important enteropathogens. Here, we propose a support vector machine (SVM)-based prediction model using the known PPIs data of E. coli that can be used to predict PPIs in other enteropathogens, such as Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella Typhi, Shigella flexneri and Yersinia entrocolitica. Different features such as domain-domain association (DDA), network topology, and sequence information were used in developing the SVM model. The proposed model using DDA, degree and amino acid composition features has achieved an accuracy of 82% and 62% on 5-fold cross validation and blind E. coli datasets, respectively. The predicted interactions were validated by Gene Ontology (GO) semantic similarity measure and String PPIs database (experimental PPIs only). Finally, we have developed a user-friendly webserver named EnPPIpred to predict intra-species PPIs in enteropathogens, which will be of great help for the experimental biologists. The webserver EnPPIpred is freely available at http://bicresources.jcbose.ac.in/ssaha4/EnPPIpred/."
