In further experiments, we have found that isonicotinic acid hydrazide considerably inhibits the formation by E. coli of indole, and that the activity of a suspension of E. coli treated with isonicotinic hydrazide recovers when the cells are in contact with pyridoxine."

During the transformation a small amount of peptides is liberated2. An attempt has been made to purify the enzyme responsible for this transformation."

https://openalex.org/W2087784306,THERE are very few reports on the necessity of boron for the growth of lower plants. Koffler et al.1 found that borax increased the penicillin yields of submerged corn-steep cultures of Penicillium as well as cultures of Penicillium in synthetic medium. No definite requirement by algæ for boron has yet been shown2.

https://openalex.org/W2049926547,"FRUCTOSE has been reported to occur in the fœtal fluids of a variety of animals, and it has been implied that this sugar is present generally in mammalian fœtuses1. However, the earlier claim that fructose occurs in the human fœtus2 has been refuted3. The problem has been re-investigated here during a comparative study of carbohydrate metabolism and related disease problems in the new-born."
https://openalex.org/W2092382664,"THE barbituric acid derivatives have a characteristic absorption spectrum in the ultra-violet, and this is the basis of the most reliable methods for their quantitative determination. Small changes of the wave-length at which maximal absorption is found and changes in the absorption curve with varying pH usually are considered to be the means by which the different members of the group can be identified. But these methods have been found troublesome and unreliable. However, as the strength of absorption differs quite appreciably from one member to another, the identification of the derivative is necessary for a quantitative determination."

https://openalex.org/W2058735599,"THE ecological significance of an experimentally demonstrated and strongly marked preference for low humidities shown by certain arthropods has recently been discussed by Smith1. Tenebrio molitor L. is one insect the behaviour of which in humidity gradients has been fully studied and which shows a well-defined dry preference2–4. In laboratory cultures of adult Tenebrio, however, we have frequently observed that, if a wad of wet cotton-wool be placed in the culture dish, the animals rapidly accumulate on the wool and drink. It is thus clear that the dry preference does not express itself in all conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1984384455,"THE disadvantage of liquid air1 as a cooling bath for the rapid quenching necessary in freezing and drying for cytological purposes was recognized by Hoerr2 as the formation of a vapour coat of low thermal conductivity around the specimen. He introduced isopentane for this purpose as a liquid of high boiling point which did not vaporize around the piece of tissue. Isopentane cannot be cooled below its melting point, −160° C., and near this temperature is a thick liquid which cannot be stirred efficiently. In a search for a better bath liquid it has been found that propane has several advantages. It can be cooled to −190° C. and is still very fluid near its melting point. It is easily obtainable as ‘Propagas’ (B.O.C.)3. Both isopentane and propane have to be cooled with liquid nitrogen, because of the fire and explosion hazard with liquid air or oxygen."
https://openalex.org/W1998397020,"IT is well known from the work of Buchner1, Breitsprecher2, and others that mycetomes occur at the anterior end of the larval midgut of several species of Anobiid beetles. The mycetocytes are distended with micro-organisms which are of obscure taxonomy, but appear yeast-like, and of which the symbiotic role has been established by Koch's3 demonstration of their necessary presence in Sitodrepa panicea, if the larva is to grow normally. Blewett and Fraenkel4 have shown that the presence of the symbionts in Sitodrepa larvæ can offset a dietary deficiency of five vitamins of the B group: the symbionts in Lasioderma serricorne can apparently supply six of these vitamins to the larva."

https://openalex.org/W2006649877,"IT was found that when men stayed in air-conditioned rooms at about 30° C. for a few days their packed red-cell volume fell1,2. A rise in this value was likewise found in conditions of low environmental temperature2. More prolonged exposure to conditions of high environmental temperature caused by change of season was also associated with a fall in the packed red-cell volume3. No satisfactory information about the physiological effect on the packed red-cell volume of people living for several months or years in a warm climate could be found in the available literature. The results of an investigation made in Singapore may, therefore, be of interest."

https://openalex.org/W1997261118,"THE results of the Scottish Mental Survey1 presented a paradox which has been difficult to resolve. These results showed a small rise in mean intelligence test score in the eleven-year-old population over a period of fifteen years; but they also established the existence of a negative correlation between intelligence test score and family size—a tendency for intelligent children to be found in small families—which implies the danger of a possible decline in national intelligence, in so far as intelligence is inherited. Though the existence of this negative correlation has now been established, its cause is the subject of considerable controversy, and predictions of the future level of national intelligence depend on how far it can be attributed to a limiting of families by intelligent parents or to the depressive effect of a poor environment on the test scores of children from large families."
https://openalex.org/W2043246523,"So far as I am aware, the extrusion of nucleolar material into the cytoplasm has not been recorded for the female germ-cells of Lumbricus or any other earthworm. In this connexion, Harvey1 remarked that in the nuclei of the “nearly ripe oocytes there may occur little droplets of material, similar in reactions to the plasmosome. They may be lying on the surface of this body, or may be entirely separate. Occasionally they are seen on the nuclear membrane, but never outside it. This may point to extrusion of nucleolar fragments, but only on a very small scale and never into the cytoplasm”. Gatenby and Nath2 observed that: “Neither Harvey nor the present writers have found any satisfactory evidence of nucleolar emission in Lumbricus”."
https://openalex.org/W2067788902,"WE have read with interest the recent communication in Nature from H. Maes1. His report of the work of I. Vincke, who has observed a rapid loss of insecticidal power of DDT on the walls of certain African houses in the Belgian Congo, provides further evidence for the sorption of DDT on lateritic soils described by us in 19512. It is also useful to find described a method for preventing this loss of efficiency; but we believe that the connexion between ability of soils to dehydrochlorinate DDT at elevated temperatures and loss of biological effectiveness is misinterpreted by Maes, and that the effect of spraying walls with phosphates is not due to inhibition of decomposition of DDT."
