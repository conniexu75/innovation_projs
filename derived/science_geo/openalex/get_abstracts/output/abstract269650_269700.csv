https://openalex.org/W1972850777,"In the last 30 years the subject of asymmetric synthesis has grown from a little studied academic niche in organic chemistry to an intensely investigated field of commercial importance and heightened general interest. Impressive advances have been made in several areas, notably catalytic asymmetric homogeneous hydrogenation, catalytic asymmetric epoxidation of allyl alcohols and stereochemical control of carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions. Asymmetric synthesis must now be deliberately considered along with other available methods as a practical strategy for the synthesis of any chiral compound."
