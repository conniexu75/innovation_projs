https://openalex.org/W1575560358,"Site-specific DNA damage by Cu(II) plus H2O2 was investigated by a DNA-sequencing technique. Cu(II) plus H2O2 induced strong DNA cleavage even without piperidine treatment. Piperidine-labile sites were induced frequently at thymine and guanine residues and rarely at adenine residue. A Cu(I)-specific chelating agent, bathocuproine, inhibited the DNA damage. Neither ethanol nor mannitol inhibited it. Of alcohols, tert-butyl alcohol, having relatively low reactivity to hydroxyl free radical, inhibited the DNA damage most strongly. Sodium azide and 1,4-diazobicyclo[2.2.2]octane completely inhibited cleavages at residues of the bases other than guanine. Tris inhibited the DNA damage. The enhancing effect of D2O on DNA damage was not observed. ESR studies using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) showed that the hydroxyl radical adduct of DMPO was formed during the reaction of Cu(II) with H2O2, and that the addition of sodium formate produced the CO2- radical adduct of DMPO more efficiently than expected. ESR studies showed that the nitroxide radical was formed from 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidone in the presence of Cu(II) plus H2O2, indicating the formation of singlet oxygen or its equivalent. The effects of scavengers on DNA damage have considerable correlation with the effects of scavengers on the nitroxide radical production and DMPO.OH formation. The results suggest that the main active species causing DNA damage are more likely copper-peroxide complexes, with similar reactivity to singlet oxygen and/or hydroxyl radical rather than hydroxyl free radical."

https://openalex.org/W2119335473,"The signal transduction pathways of the cloned human 5-HT1A receptor have been examined in two mammalian cell lines transiently (COS-7) or permanently (HeLa) expressing this receptor gene. In both systems, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) mediated a marked inhibition of beta 2-adrenergic agonist-stimulated (80% inhibition in COS-7 cells) or forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation (up to 90% inhibition in HeLa cells). This serotonin effect (EC50 = 20 nM) could be competitively antagonized by metitepine and spiperone (Ki = 81 and 31 nM, respectively) and could also be blocked by pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin. In both cell types, 5-HT failed to stimulate adenylyl cyclase through the expressed receptors. In HeLa cells, 5-HT also stimulated phospholipase C (approximately 40-75% stimulation of formation of inositol phosphates). Again, this effect was inhibited by metitepine. However, the EC50 of 5-HT was considerably higher (approximately 3.2 microM) than that found for inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Both pathways were demonstrated to be similarly affected by pertussis toxin. These findings indicate that like the M2 and M3 muscarinic cholinergic receptors, the 5-HT1A receptor can couple to multiple transduction pathways with varying efficiencies via pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins. The lack of stimulation of cAMP formation by this 5-HT1A receptor may suggest the existence of another pharmacologically closely related receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2105490477,"We recently showed that phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate (PIP3) was present in a unique lipid fraction generated in neutrophils during activation. Here, we demonstrate that the band containing this fraction isolated from thin layer chromatography consists primarily of PIP3 and that only small amounts of radiolabeled PIP3 exist prior to activation. In addition, high performance liquid chromatography of deacylated phospholipids from stimulated cells reveals an increase in a fraction eluting ahead of glycerophosphoinositol 4,5-P2. After removal of the glycerol we found that it coeluted with inositol 1,3,4-P3 when resubjected to high performance liquid chromatography. Thus, we have detected a second, novel form of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate in activated neutrophils, PI-(3,4)P2. The elevation of PIP3 through the formyl peptide receptor is blocked by pretreatment with pertussis toxin, implicating mediation of the increase in PIP3 by a guanosine triphosphate-binding (G) protein. The rise in PIP3 is not secondary to calcium elevation. Buffering the rise in intracellular calcium did not diminish the increase in PIP3. The elevation of PIP3 appears to occur during activation with physiological agonists, its level varying with the degree of activation. Leukotriene B4, which elicits many of the same responses as stimulation of the formyl peptide receptor but with minimal oxidant production, stimulates a much attenuated rise in PIP3. Isoproterenol, which inhibits oxidant production also reduces the rise in PIP3. Hence formation of PI(3,4)P2 and PIP3 (presumed to be PI(3,4,5)P3) correlates closely with the early events of neutrophil activation."
https://openalex.org/W1525329782,"We have reduced the GTPase activity of the α subunit of Gs, the guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein that stimulates adenylyl cyclase, by introduction of point mutations analogous to those described in p21ras. Mutants G49V and Q227L differ from the wild type protein in the substitution of Val for Gly49 and Leu for Gln227, respectively (analogous to positions 12 and 61 in p21ras). Wild type and mutant proteins were synthesized in Escherichia coli, purified, and characterized. The rate constants for dissociation of GDP from G49V recombinant Gsα (rGsα) (0.47/min) and Q227L rGsα (0.23/min) differ by no more than 2-fold from that observed for the wild type protein (0.5/min). In marked contrast, the rate constants for hydrolysis of GTP by G49V rGsα (0.78/min) and Q227L rGsα (0.03–0.06/min) are 4-fold and roughly 100-fold slower than that for wild type rGsα (3.5/min). These reductions in the rate of hydrolysis of GTP result in significant fractional occupancy of these proteins by GTP in the presence of the nucleotide, 0.37 for G49V rGsα and 0.78 for Q227L rGsα, compared to 0.05 for wild type rGsα. When reconstituted with cyc- (Gsα-deficient) S49 cell membranes or purified adenylyl cyclase, both mutant proteins stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity in the presence of GTP to a much greater extent than does wild type Gsα; their maximal ability to activate the enzyme is largely unaltered. The fractional ability of a given Gsα polypeptide to active adenylyl cyclase in the presence of GTP correlates well with the fractinal occupancy of the protein by the nucleotide. The mutant subunits appear to interact normally with G protein βγ subunits, and their ability to activate adenylyl cyclase is enhanced by interaction with β-adrenergic receptors. These results indicate that the structural analogy that has been inferred between the guanine nucleotide-binding domains of G proteins and the p21ras family is at least generally correct. They also provide confirmation of the kinetic model of G protein function and document mutations that permit the expression in vivo of constitutively activated G protein α subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1512107284,"Mutational replacements of specific residues in the GTP-binding pocket of the 21-kDa ras proteins (p21ras) reduce their GTPase activity. To test the possibility that the cognate regions of G protein α chains participate in GTP binding and hydrolysis, we compared signaling functions of normal and mutated α chains (termed αs) of Gs, the stimulatory regulator of adenylyl cyclase. αs chains were expressed in an αs-deficient S49 mouse lymphoma cell line, cyc-. αs in which leucine replaces glutamine 227 (corresponding to glutamine 61 of p21ras) constitutively activates adenylyl cyclase and reduces the kcat for GTP hydrolysis more than 100-fold. There is a smaller reduction in GTPase activity in another mutant in which valine replaces glycine 49 (corresponding to glycine 12 of p21ras). This mutant αs is a poor activator of adenylyl cyclase. Moreover, the glycine 49 protein, unlike normal αs, is not protected against tryptic cleavage by hydrolysis resistant GTP analogs; this finding suggests impairment of the mutant protein's ability to attain the active (GTP-bound) conformation. We conclude that αs residues near glutamine 227 and glycine 49 participate in binding and hydrolysis of GTP, although the GTP binding regions of αs and p21ras are not identical."
https://openalex.org/W2171184423,"Site-specific recombination catalyzed by Tn3 resolvase proceeds with a linkage change, delta Lk, of +4 in the forward resolution reaction and -4 in the catenane fusion reverse reaction. The reverse reaction occurs only at low superhelical densities and gives unknotted circular products, consistent with plectonemic and not solenoidal wrapping of the two recombination sites. The strand exchange topologies are consistent with a mechanism in which resolvase cleaves all four DNA strands and religates them after a 180 degrees rotation of two duplex partners in a right-handed sense for the ""forward"" reaction, and in a left-handed sense for the ""reverse"" action. This could be achieved by a 180 degrees rotation of two resolvase subunits within a tetramer with D2 symmetry; we suggest that a different symmetry applies to phage lamda integrase catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2046316015,"Destabilization of a P element transposon inserted in the subtelomeric reglon induced a set of similar chromosomal rearrangements. These rearrangements appear to be terminal deletions with endpoints clustered at the centromere-distal end of the transposon. The terminally deleted chromosome progressively loses sequences from the broken end at a rate of approximately 50–100 bp per fly generation, suggesting that the replication of this end may be incomplete. In most cases, capping of the broken end by readdition of new sequences was not observed. Past failures to recover terminal deletions of Drosophila chromosomes following X-ray mutagenesis may have been due to a cell cycle arrest in response to unrepaired DNA damage rather than to an absolute requirement for the telomere."
https://openalex.org/W1511600524,"Abstract We examined the relationship between phosphatidylcholine (PC) hydrolysis, phosphoinositide hydrolysis, and diacylglycerol (DAG) formation in response to muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) stimulation in 1321N1 astrocytoma cells. Carbachol increases the release of [3H]choline and [3H]phosphorylcholine ([3H]Pchol) from cells containing [3H]choline-labeled PC. The production of Pchol is rapid and transient, while choline production continues for at least 30 min. mAChR-stimulated release of Pchol is reduced in cells that have been depleted of intracellular Ca2+ stores by ionomycin pretreatment, whereas choline release is unaffected by this pretreatment. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) increases the release of choline, but not Pchol, from 1321N1 cells, and down-regulation of protein kinase C blocks the ability of carbachol to stimulate choline production. Taken together, these results suggest that Ca2+ mobilization is involved in mAChR-mediated hydrolysis of PC by a phospholipase C, whereas protein kinase C activation is required for mAChR-stimulated hydrolysis of PC by a phospholipase D. Both carbachol and PMA rapidly increase the formation of [3H]phosphatidic acid ([3H]PA) in cells containing [3H]myristate-labeled PC. [3H]Diacylglycerol ([3H]DAG) levels increase more slowly, suggesting that the predominant pathway for PC hydrolysis is via phospholipase D. When cells are labeled with [3H]myristate and [14C]arachidonate such that there is a much greater 3H/14C ratio in PC compared with the phosphoinositides, the 3H/14C ratio in DAG and PA increases with PMA treatment but decreases in response to carbachol. By analyzing the increase in 3H versus 14C in DAG, we estimate that the DAG that is formed in response to PMA arises largely from PC. Muscarinic receptor activation also causes formation of DAG from PC, but approximately 20% of carbachol-stimulated DAG appears to arise from hydrolysis of the phosphoinositides."
https://openalex.org/W1544334147,"Abstract Changes in the cellular content of 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) in isolated rat pancreatic acini in response to agonist stimulation were studied using a sensitive mass assay. When acini were stimulated by 10 nM COOH-terminal cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK8), the increase in DAG was biphasic, consisting of an early peak at 5 s and a second, larger, gradual increase that was maximal by 15 min. The basal level of DAG in acini was 1.04 nmol/mg of protein, which was increased to 1.24 nmol/mg of protein at 5 s and 2.76 nmol/mg of protein at 30 min. In comparison, the increase in DAG stimulated by 30 pM CCK8, a submaximal concentration for amylase release, was monophasic, increasing without an early peak but sustained to 60 min. Other Ca2+-mobilizing secretagogues such as carbamylcholine and bombesin increased DAG in acini, whereas vasoactive intestinal peptide, which acts to increase cAMP, had no effect. Phorbol ester and Ca2+ ionophore also stimulated DAG production. Analysis of the mass level of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (1,4,5-IP3) showed that the generation of 1,4,5-IP3 stimulated by 10 nM CCK8 peaked at 5 s, a finding consistent with the early peak of DAG. The basal level was 4.7 pmol/mg of protein, which was increased to 144.6 pmol/mg of protein at 5 s by 10 nM CCK8. The levels of 1,4,5-IP3 then returned toward basal in contrast to the gradual and sustained increase of DAG. The dose dependencies of 1,4,5-IP3 and DAG formation at 5 s with respect to CCK8 were almost identical. This suggests that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis is a major source of the early increase in DAG but not of the sustained increase in DAG. Therefore, a possible contribution of phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis to DAG formation was examined utilizing acini prelabeled with [3H]choline. CCK8 (1 nM) maximally increased [3H]choline metabolite release by 133% of control at 30 min. Separation of these metabolites by thin layer chromatography showed that the products of CCK8-stimulated release were almost entirely phosphorylcholine, indicating the activation of a phospholipase C specific for phosphatidylcholine. By comparison, 1 nM CCK8 stimulated [3H]ethanolamine metabolite release from [3H]ethanolamine-labeled acini by only 22% of control. These data suggest that CCK stimulates both phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis; the latter may contribute to the sustained generation of DAG and hence the maintained activation of protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1607643143,"We have examined the level of incorporation of 32P into DNA topoisomerase II in vivo in chicken lymphoblastoid cells that were fractionated into the various cell cycle phases by centrifugal elutriation. We find that topoisomerase II is phosphorylated in vivo, with the level of incorporation being approximately 3.5-fold higher in the G2 + M fraction than earlier in the cell cycle. Our antibody studies have revealed that topoisomerase II antigen exists as a number of discrete polypeptide species in these cells. Of these, the 170-kDa intact polypeptide is phosphorylated approximately 4.5-fold more than several antigenic fragments that actually comprise the bulk of the topoisomerase II antigen in these cells at mitosis. Phosphorylation of the 170-kDa form of the enzyme may be involved in activation of the enzyme for its role in the disjunction of sister chromatids at anaphase."
https://openalex.org/W1583996118,"The Escherichia coli spoT gene encodes a guanosine-3′,5′-bispyrophosphate (ppGpp) 3′-pyrophosphohydrolase known to be responsible for cellular (ppGpp) degradation. The DNA sequence of the spoT region is presented. The spoT gene is deduced to be 702 codons long, with a probable UUG initiation codon, and a deduced mass of 79,342 daltons. Two spoT mutations (spoT202 and spoT203) have been localized to an open reading frame by complementation of function as well as by genetic marker rescue. The ability to overexpress the spoT gene is limited, but enough ppGppase activity can be made to reverse ppGpp accumulation during the stringent response to amino acid starvation. The spoT gene is located within a larger spo operon and is flanked by two smaller genes. The first gene in the operon encodes omega, a protein that copurifies with RNA polymerase (Gentry, D. R., and Burgess, R. R. (1986) Gene (Amst.) 48, 33–40). The spoT gene is the second gene in the operon; it is followed by a third open reading frame deduced to encode a protein with a mass of 25,343 daltons. Insertion of a kanamycin resistance gene in the omega gene reduces spoT gene expression as judged by lowered ppGppase activity, relA-dependent reduction of growth rate, and abolition of spoT mutant complementation activity. These effects are reversed by expression of the spoT gene, but not the omega gene, in trans. Transcription of the spo operon occurs in a clockwise direction on the E. coli chromosome and is probably directed by at least two promoters."
https://openalex.org/W1490321115,"Abstract In order to study the function of individual phospholipids, we have constructed a strain of Escherichia coli in which the ratio of phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylglycerol plus cardiolipin can be regulated. In this strain (HDL1001) the normal expression of the phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase does not occur due to the presence of the pgsA30 allele (Heacock, P. N., and Dowhan, W. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 13044-13049). A second chromosomal copy of the pgsA gene is fused to the lacOP region in single copy within the lac operon. Strain HDL1001 is absolutely dependent for growth on an inducer of the lac operon. In addition, the level of the pgsA gene product, the content of the two major acidic phospholipids, and the growth rate are dependent on the level of inducer in the growth medium. Cells remain viable in the absence of inducer as evidenced by a rapid return to normal growth after the readdition of inducer. The growth rate and phospholipid composition are affected only after the level of phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase drops below about 15% of normal levels; both phosphatidic acid and (d)CDP-diacylglycerol also begin to increase to significant levels. At the point of cell arrest the level of the major acidic phospholipids is reduced by about 90% of wild type levels."
https://openalex.org/W1490673923,"Abstract We purified to homogeneity the Dictyostelium discoideum myosin heavy chain kinase that is implicated in the heavy chain phosphorylation increases that occur during chemotaxis. The kinase is initially found in the insoluble fraction of developed cells. The major purification step was achieved by affinity chromatography using a tail fragment of Dictyostelium myosin (LMM58) expressed in Escherichia coli (De Lozanne, A., Berlot, C. H., Leinwand, L. A., and Spudich, J. A. (1988) J. Cell Biol. 105, 2990-3005). The kinase has an apparent molecular weight of 84,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The apparent native molecular weight by gel filtration is 240,000. The kinase catalyzes phosphorylation of myosin heavy chain or LMM58 with similar kinetics, and the extent of phosphorylation for both is 4 mol of phosphate/mol. With both substrates the Vmax is about 18 mumol/min/mg and the Km is 15 microM. The myosin heavy chain kinase is specific to Dictyostelium myosin heavy chain, and the phosphorylated amino acid is threonine. The kinase undergoes autophosphorylation. Each mole of kinase subunit incorporates about 20 mol of phosphates. Phosphorylation of myosin by this kinase inhibits myosin thick filament formation, suggesting that the kinase plays a role in the regulation of myosin assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1522247366,"Abstract Epidermal growth factor (EGF) activates the intrinsic tyrosine-specific protein kinase of its receptor (EGF-R). We studied the effect of EGF-dependent EGF-R internalization on receptor autophosphorylation and on the appearance of tyrosine phosphoproteins in rat liver epithelial cells. Peak receptor autophosphorylation activity (3- to 6-fold over basal) was found in homogenates of EGF-treated cells at times when the majority of receptors (greater than 90%) had been internalized but not yet degraded (15 to 30 min). Stimulated activity persisted for at least 2 h if EGF-R degradation was blocked by methylamine or 18 degrees C incubation. Detection of stimulated autophosphorylation in homogenates of cells treated with EGF in culture required detergent in the assay. Detergent was not necessary to detect stimulated autophosphorylation when EGF was added directly to homogenates of untreated cells. Immunoblots using antibodies against phosphotyrosine (p-Tyr) demonstrated that EGF treatment of intact cells increased the p-Tyr content of at least seven proteins (EGF-R, 115, 100, 75, 66, 57, and 52 kDa) within 5 s. Incubation of intact cells with EGF at 0 degrees C to prevent endocytosis still resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of these seven proteins. In contrast, several substrates (120, 78, and 38 kDa) showed delayed increases (45-90 s) in tyrosine phosphorylation at 37 degrees C; their phosphorylation was even slower at 18 degrees C and did not occur at 0 degrees C. In cells incubated with EGF at 18 degrees C or in the presence of methylamine, EGF-R p-Tyr in the intact cell was lost by 2 h even though receptor was not degraded and still exhibited enhanced autophosphorylation in the homogenate assay. These findings suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation in response to EGF occurs predominantly during the initial stages of endocytosis and is mediated for the most part by ligand-receptor complexes at the cell surface. A subset of phosphorylations may require intracellular movement."
https://openalex.org/W1551874386,"Calcium ions occupy low (n congruent to 10; Kd congruent to 1 mM) and high (n = 3; Kd congruent to 1 microM) affinity sites on fibrinogen and facilitate fibrin monomer polymerization. We have previously localized two of the three high affinity Ca2+ sites to gamma 311-gamma 336. However, optimal enhancement of fibrin monomer polymerization occurs only at physiological millimolar Ca2+ concentrations which are two orders of magnitude higher than the concentration required for occupancy of the high affinity Ca2+-binding sites. In this study, we show that removal of fibrinogen sialic acid residues results in loss of low affinity Ca2+-binding sites. Clotting of asialofibrinogen appears to be Ca2+-independent and results in fiber bundles thicker in diameter than normal fibrin bundles as determined by turbidometry and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. By using a Ca2+-sensitive electrode, free sialic acid is shown to bind Ca2+ (Kd congruent to 1 mM). These observations suggest that the high affinity fibrinogen D-domain Ca2+-binding sites may play a role in the tertiary structure of the D-domain, whereas, sialic acid residues are low affinity sites whose occupancy by Ca2+ at physiological calcium concentration facilitates fibrin polymerization."
https://openalex.org/W1486002433,"Full-length human parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP-(1–141] as well as a carboxyl-terminal shortened form (PTHrP-(1–108] have been expressed from recombinant DNA-derived clones. These proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli as fusion proteins so that cyanogen bromide cleavage yields the desired product. Both proteins were purified and then characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, amino-terminal amino acid sequencing, peptide mapping, and mass spectral analysis. Recombinant PTHrP-(1–141), PTHrP-(1–108), synthetic PTHrP-(1–34), and naturally derived PTHrP are all equipotent in the stimulation of cyclic AMP levels in the osteoblast-like cell line UMR 106–01. However, PTHrP-(1–141) and -(1–108) are two to four times more active than PTHrP-(1–34) in the stimulation of plasminogen activator activity from this cell line. PTHrP-(1–141) reacts equipotently with PTHrP-(1–34) in a radioimmunoassay using an antiserum prepared against PTHrP-(1–34). PTHrP-(1–141), -(1–108), and -(1–84) were used as PTHrP-specific mobility standards on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis to determine the approximate length of two forms of naturally derived PTHrP. The data show that PTHrP purified from the lung tumor cell line BEN contains a major form of about 108 amino acids and another form of about 141 amino acids."

The enzyme is a glycoprotein of apparent Mr = 52,000-60,000 that is found in low abundance (less than 0.001% of the cell lysate protein), principally in the granule fraction of the cells. The protein has two disulfide-linked subunits of apparent Mr = 50,000 and 14,000-20,000, each of which contains N-linked oligosaccharides. This is the first lipopolysaccharide-degrading enzyme that has been purified from animal cells."
https://openalex.org/W1552154435,"Abstract Adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate kinase (ATP:adenylylsulfate 3'-phosphotransferase), the second enzyme in the pathway of sulfate activation, has been purified (approximately 300-fold) to homogeneity from an Escherichia coli K12 strain, which overproduces the enzyme activity (approximately 100-fold). The purified enzyme has a specific activity of 153 mumol of 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) formed/min/mg of protein at 25 degrees C. The enzyme is remarkably efficient with a Vmax/Km(APS) of greater than 10(8) M-1 s-1, indicating that at physiologically low substrate concentrations the reaction is essentially diffusion limited. Upon incubation with MgATP a phosphorylated enzyme is formed; the isolated phosphorylated enzyme can transfer its phosphoryl group to adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (APS) to form PAPS or to ADP to form ATP. The phosphorylated enzyme exists as a dimer of identical 21-kilodalton subunits, while the dephosphorylated form primarily exists as a tetramer. Divalent cations are required for activity with Mg(II), Mn(II), Co(II), and Cd(II) activating. Studies of the divalent metal-dependent stereoselectivity for the alpha- and beta-phosphorothioate derivatives of ATP indicate metal coordination to at least the alpha-phosphoryl group of the nucleotide. Steady state kinetic studies of the reverse reaction indicate a sequential mechanism, with a rapid equilibrium ordered binding of MgADP before PAPS. In the forward direction APS is a potent substrate inhibitor, competitive with ATP, complicating kinetic studies. The primary kinetic mechanism in the forward direction is sequential. Product inhibition studies at high concentrations of APS suggest an ordered kinetic mechanism with MgATP binding before APS. At submicromolar concentrations of APS, product inhibition by both MgADP and PAPS is more complex and is not consistent with a solely ordered sequential mechanism. The formation of a phosphorylated enzyme capable of transferring its phosphoryl group to APS or to MgADP suggests that a ping-pong pathway in which the rate of MgADP dissociation is comparable to the rate of APS binding might contribute at very low concentrations of APS. The substrate inhibition by APS is consistent with APS binding to the enzyme, to form a dead-end E.APS complex."
https://openalex.org/W1570294119,"Monoamine oxidase B that has been synthesized by a reticulocyte lysate charged with bovine liver RNA will insert in a proteinase K-resistant form into isolated outer membranes from rat liver mitochondria. It appears that ubiquitin, a 76-amino acid polypeptide which is enzymatically conjugated to proteins, may be involved in the insertion process. Depletion of endogenous ubiquitin from the reticulocyte lysate with purified antibodies against this polypeptide inhibits the insertion of monoamine oxidase B, and this inhibition is relieved if ubiquitin is restored. On the other hand, a mutant form of ubiquitin which is unable to conjugate with proteins will not support insertion. Conjugation with ubiquitin is an ATP-dependent process. Not only does enzymatic depletion of ATP from the lysate prevent the insertion of monoamine oxidase, but ubiquitin will not restore insertion unless ATP is also present. These data indicate that the formation of a ubiquitin conjugate is involved in the insertion of newly synthesized monoamine oxidase B into the outer membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1595174102,"Abstract The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor of HeLa cells was solubilized in Triton X-100 and characterized by gel filtration, affinity labeling, and ligand blotting studies. Receptors solubilized with Triton X-100 eluted in gel filtration as a major peak of Mr = 330,000 and retained high affinity binding (KD = 0.25 nM). Affinity labeling of soluble receptor/125I-TNF complexes using the reversible, bifunctional bis[2-(succinimidooxycarbonyl-oxy)ethyl] sulfone resulted in the formation of cross-linked species of Mr = 310,000, 150,000-175,000, 95,000, and 75,000. The formation of these complexes was competitively inhibited by unlabeled TNF. Partial reversal of cross-linking in these complexes and their analysis by two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) resolved 125I-TNF dimers cleaved from the 95,000 band and 125I-TNF monomer cleaved from the 75,000 band, providing evidence for a Mr approximately 60,000 subunit. In addition, the 95,000 and 75,000 bands were resolved as components of larger complexes (Mr = 150,000-175,000), which presumably contain two receptor subunits. The Mr 95,000 and 75,000 bands were also released from the Mr 310,000 complex by reduction with dithiothreitol, suggesting a role for disulfide bond stabilization. To investigate the association of the putative receptor subunits, Triton X-100 extracts from HeLa membranes were fractionated by SDS-PAGE without reduction and transferred electrophoretically to nylon membranes for TNF binding assays. Only two bands of Mr = 60,000 and 70,000 specifically bound TNF, and higher Mr binding activity was not observed. These results indicate that TNF receptors in HeLa cells are high molecular weight complexes containing Mr = 60,000 and 70,000 subunits each capable of binding TNF and that the complexes are primarily stabilized by non-covalent, hydrophobic interactions."

https://openalex.org/W1498003610,"Abstract The inner aspect of the nuclear envelope is supported by a peripheral framework called the nuclear scaffold, which consists of both structural and functional proteins. Its major structural components, lamins A-C, form a highly polymerized and insoluble fibrous matrix during interphase of the cell cycle. Functional constituents of the scaffold include the 46-kDa nucleoside triphosphatase which is thought to participate in nucleocytoplasmic transport of mRNA. This 46-kDa component shares an amino-terminal sequence with lamins A and C, indicating that proteolytic remodeling of the nuclear scaffold may contribute to the generation of nucleoside triphosphatase activity (Clawson, G. A., Lackey, A., and Tokes, Z. A. (1988) Exp. Cell Res. 176, 180-186). We report here that neutral protease activity intimately associated with the nuclear scaffold is also a functional constituent. This activity has a considerable selectivity for lamins as shown by self-digestion of scaffold preparations, and it may participate in the remodeling of the nuclear scaffold after treatment with carcinogens."
https://openalex.org/W1673414420,"We developed a novel method to quantify trace amounts of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) using antibodies against PIP and PIP2. With this method, polyphosphoinositides can be measured in the range from 20 to 500 pmol. We applied the method to quantify changes in PIP and PIP2 levels in Balb/c/3T3 cells stimulated by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha), growth factors that stimulate the hydrolysis of PIP and PIP2. PIP2 content decreased rapidly to about 60% of control within 1 min while PIP content decreased gradually but significantly to 60% (PDGF) or 70% (PGF2 alpha) of control. Simultaneously we measured the mass levels of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and 1,2-diacylglycerol (DG). Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate levels rapidly increased and reached a maximum at 30 s after PDGF or PGF2 alpha stimulation and then decreased to the control level within 2 min. On the other hand, DG formation showed biphasic changes. In the first phase, DG rapidly accumulated and reached a maximum at 30 s after PDGF or PGF2 alpha stimulation and then quickly decreased. In the second phase, DG accumulated gradually, but very markedly, 2 min after PDGF or PGF2 alpha stimulation. Considering the changes in PIP2, DG in the first phase seems to be derived mainly from PIP2 while most of the DG in the second phase derived from other lipids."
https://openalex.org/W1480655900,"Abstract Neutrophils treated with optimal amounts of tumor promoters that activate protein kinase C (e.g. mezerein) release large quantities of superoxide (O2-) and exhibit an intense phosphorylation of two proteins with molecular masses of approximately 47 and 49 kDa. These cells can also be stimulated synergistically to release a comparable amount of O2-. This involves treatment with a suboptimal amount of a tumor promoter and an agent capable of elevating cellular Ca2+. Neutrophils treated in the former fashion exhibit a redistribution of the activity of protein kinase C from a soluble to a particulate fraction that is stable in the presence of Ca2+ chelators, whereas cells stimulated synergistically do not do so to an appreciable extent (Badwey, J. A., Robinson, J. M., Horn, W., Soberman, R. J., Karnovsky, M. J., and Karnovsky, M. L. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 2779-2786). In this paper, we report that neutrophils stimulated synergistically do exhibit a significant incorporation of 32P into the 47-kDa protein, but with little labeling of the 49-kDa species. This labeling of the 47-kDa protein was greater than the sum of those observed with each agent added separately but was less than that observed in cells stimulated with optimal amounts of tumor promoters alone. An inhibitor of protein kinase C (1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine) blocked O2- release and the phosphorylation of the 47-kDa protein under all conditions of stimulation mentioned, whereas an inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinases had no effect on these phenomena. Thus, labeling of the 47-kDa protein can occur in the absence of a tight translocation of protein kinase C to membrane and was always observed during synergy. The data support a role for protein kinase C and the 47-kDa phosphoprotein in the synergistic stimulation of neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W1522211358,"Cytochrome b562 does not behave as a single independent thermodynamic component in preparations of purified quinol cytochrome c reductase. This effect is much more pronounced in quinone sufficient preparations; in such preparations, the epr spectrum of the cytochrome is Eh sensitive, with a peak shift from g = 3.42 to 3.48 occurring as the potential is lowered from 100 mV to 0 mV. The peak shift is dependent on the presence of quinone and can be restored to quinone-depleted preparations by supplementation with ubiquinol 2 if phospholipid depletion is not too severe. The results suggest that cytochrome b562 is strongly interacting with the Qc quinone binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1523821465,"Abstract The reaction of superoxide radical (O2-) with the heme protein indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase has been investigated by the use of pulse radiolysis. In the absence of the substrate tryptophan (Trp), the ferric enzyme reacted quantitatively with O2- to form the oxygenated enzyme. The rate constant for the reaction (8.0 x 10(6) M-1 s-1 at pH 7.0) increased with a decrease in pH. In the presence of low concentrations of L-Trp (approximately 50 microM), under which the catalytic site of the ferric enzyme is greater than 99% Trp-free at pH 7.0, the only spectral species observed upon O2- binding was L-Trp-bound oxygenated enzyme, the ternary complex. This suggests that under the conditions employed O2- binds first to the ferric enzyme to form the oxygenated enzyme and is followed by rapid binding of L-Trp. It was also found that absorbance changes (delta A) for the enzyme after the pulse were significantly decreased when an increased L-Trp concentration was employed. A 50% decrease in delta A was caused with approximately 50 microM L-Trp at pH 7.0. Similar results were also observed with other indole derivatives with decreasing delta A values in the order of indole, 3-indoleethanol, alpha-methyl-DL-Trp, and D-Trp. These results suggest that there exists a binding site for these compounds in the dioxygenase different from the catalytic site for Trp and, most significantly, that binding of Trp to the effector binding site of the ferric enzyme markedly inhibits its reaction with O2-."
https://openalex.org/W1584384445,"Several different proton pumps were used to generate a proton motive force (Δp, proton motive force across the mitochondrial inner membrane) in isolated rat liver mitochondria, and the relationship between Δ p and pump rate was investigated by titrating with various inhibitors of the pumps. It was found that this relationship was the same for mitochondria respiring on succinate irrespective of whether respiration was inhibited with malonate, antimycin or cyanide, indicating that the relationship was independent of the redox state of the respiratory chain. When Δp was generated by either the cytochrome bc1 complex, cytochrome oxidase, both together, or ATP hydrolysis (and transport), the reaction rates (in moles of electrons or ATP) were in the ratio of close to 3:1.5:1:1, respectively, at all accessible values of Δp. This suggests that the proton stoichiometries (H+/e and H+/ATP, where H+/e is the number of protons translocated vectorially across the inner membrane per electron transferred by the respiratory chain and H+/ATP is the number of protons translocated vectorially per ATP molecule hydrolyzed externally) were in the ratio of close to 1:2:3:3, respectively, at all values of Δp. Possible reasons for previous contradictory results are suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1607489390,"Abstract The sequences upstream and downstream of the cloned gene for the alpha-subunit of the Na+ pump oxaloacetate decarboxylase of Klebsiella pneumonia were determined. An open reading frame in the upstream region was identified as the gene for the gamma-subunit, and an open reading frame in the downstream region represents the gene for the beta-subunit. The deduced primary structure of the gamma- and beta-subunit was confirmed by protein sequencing of about 37 and 22%, respectively, of each polypeptide chain. The gene for the gamma-subunit has a GC content of 64% and codes for 83 amino acids. The protein is not processed at its amino terminus or at its carboxyl terminus. The gene for the beta-subunit has a GC content of 66% and codes for 327 amino acids. The protein contains a blocked aminoterminal methionine residue. Whether processing occurs at the carboxyl terminus is unknown. Hydropathy calculations defined one transmembrane helix in the amino-terminal part of the gamma-subunit and a hydrophilic carboxyl-terminal part that is certainly not embedded within the lipid bilayer. A proline- and alanine-rich sequence in the carboxyl-terminal part may provide the protein with conformational flexibility. According to hydropathy and acrophilicity calculations, the secondary structure of the beta-subunit may be formed with 5 or 6 intramembrane helical segments."

https://openalex.org/W1603054198,"Abstract Retinal stimulates the activity of phospholipase C and superoxide (O2-) release in neutrophils. The latter response is comparable in magnitude to that observed when phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) is the stimulating agent. Cells treated with retinal, however, do not undergo degranulation, nor do they exhibit the formation of intracellular vesicles, as is commonly observed with other agents (e.g. Lochner, J. E., Badwey, J. A., Horn, W., and Karnovsky, M. L. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 83, 7673-7677). Retinal promotes redistribution of the activity of protein kinase C from a soluble to a particulate fraction in neutrophils, and this redistribution precedes O2- release. Superoxide release stimulated with retinal, however, is largely insensitive to inhibitors of protein kinase C (1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7); staurosporine). These compounds substantially block both O2- release and the phosphorylation of two proteins with molecular masses of about 47 and 49 kDa when the stimulus is PMA. The data indicate that retinal and PMA elicit the formation of active protein kinase C complexes of different natures, or that the mechanism of stimulation of O2- release by retinal does not involve this kinase. The significance of these observations to the common use of retinoids as inhibitors of protein kinase C is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1602588670,"Exposure of human skin fibroblasts to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) results in a transient increase in the level of topoisomerase I mRNA. A maximal increase (about 10-fold) in the level of topoisomerase I mRNA was observed 3 h after adding 200 nM PMA, but a decrease to the basal level was observed within 12 h of PMA treatment. The lowest PMA concentration to give an observable induction of topoisomerase I gene expression was found to be 20 nM. In addition, the induction of topoisomerase I gene expression by 20 nM PMA pulse treatment for 10 min followed by incubation for an additional 3 h attained the same level of induction seen with 3 h of continuous exposure to 20 nM PMA. This observation suggests that once the signal for protein kinase C activation is transduced, continuous exposure to PMA is not necessary for the maximal effect. To gain insight into the mechanism by which PMA stimulates topoisomerase I gene expression, cells were treated with PMA, cycloheximide, and actinomycin D, either alone or in various combinations. The results show that actinomycin D, but not cycloheximide, specifically abolishes the stimulatory effect of PMA, suggesting that PMA affects topoisomerase I gene expression at the transcriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W1598609126,"Abstract The behavior of steroidogenesis activator polypeptide (SAP), a recently described modulator of cholesterol side-chain cleavage activity (Pedersen, R. C., and Brownie, A. C. (1987) Science 236, 188-190), was investigated in rat adrenocortical cells using a specific radioimmunoassay. In response to a maximal dose of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (1 nM) or of 8-Br-cAMP (1 mM), an increase in intracellular SAP begins rapidly (less than 1 min) and reaches half-maximal and maximal levels (16-fold greater than basal) at 3 and 15 min, respectively. A plateau at this maximal concentration of SAP is then maintained. The levels of intracellular SAP content and of corticosterone output exhibit a similar dose-dependent response to ACTH (EC50 = 25 and 30 pM, respectively). Treatment of ACTH-stimulated cells with cycloheximide reverses the rise in SAP (t1/2 congruent to 5-7 min). In vivo the SAP content of adrenals from quiescent rats is concordant with the circadian rhythm of the pituitary-adrenal axis; at the apex (1800 h), adrenal SAP is 13-fold higher than at the nadir (0800 h), paralleling 2- and 7-fold variations in cholesterol side-chain cleavage activity and serum corticosterone levels, respectively. At both time points, SAP levels rise in response to stress. Of the rat tissues examined, only the major steroid-forming organs (adrenal cortex and gonads) had significant levels of immunoreactive, cAMP-responsive SAP, while cAMP-unresponsive immunoreactivity was also detectable in the thymus, spleen, and brain. Considered together with the biological activity previously demonstrated for SAP in vitro, these data are consistent with its role as a cAMP-dependent, cycloheximide-sensitive modulator of steroid biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1667672667,"Abstract We report the isolation and analysis of genomic clones containing the entire gene encoding the muscle-specific subunit of human phosphoglycerate mutase. The gene spans 2.83 kilobase pairs and has a three-exon/two-intron structure that is similar to the organization of the human 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate mutase gene (Joulin, V., Garel, M.-C., LeBoulch, P., Valentin, C., Rosa, R., Rosa, J., and Cohen-Solal, M.

A canonical TATA box and an inverted CCAAT box are present immediately upstream of this gene. Comparison with other muscle-specific enzyme genes reveals a conserved 9-base pair element (GGGGCTGGG) in the 5'-flanking region that may be associated with the expression of genes encoding muscle-specific enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1555694919,"4,6-Difluoroserotonin, a serotonin analog with an acidic 5-hydroxyl proton (pK alpha = 7.97) relative to serotonin (pK alpha = 10.73), was tested as a substrate for the biogenic amine transporter of bovine chromaffin granules and the plasma membrane serotonin transporter of human blood platelets. The platelet serotonin transporter transports this analog with identical rates as those for serotonin, both at pH 6.7, where the hydroxyl group is predominantly protonated and at pH 9, where it is largely dissociated. In contrast, the chromaffin granule biogenic amine transporter prefers the form of 4,6-difluoroserotonin with a protonated 5-hydroxyl group. Thus, the KM for 4,6-difluoroserotonin increases, and Vmax decreases (relative to the values for serotonin) as the pH increases from 7 to 9. This effect may reflect a specific requirement for the protonated hydroxyl group in substrate translocation, as opposed to binding, since the KI for 4,6-difluoroserotonin inhibition of serotonin transport is the same as the KM for serotonin from pH 7 to 9."
https://openalex.org/W1509179347,"Abstract Platelet glycoproteins IIb and IIIa function as a fibrinogen receptor on the activated platelet. We have shown that these glycoproteins can be incorporated onto the surface of phosphatidylcholine vesicles with retention of fibrinogen and antibody binding properties and can permit Ca2+ transit across the phospholipid bilayer. In the current study we demonstrate that this apparent Ca2+ channel function is specifically inhibited by the synthetic analogue of the fibrinogen gamma COOH-terminal peptide, His-His-Leu-Gly-Gly-Ala-Lys-Gln-Ala-Gly-Asp-Val (His-12-Val), but not by the adhesive protein sequence Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS). Prior incubation of IIb-IIIa liposomes with RGDS prevented Ca2+ transit inhibition by 25 microM His-12-Val, analogous to RGDS inhibition of His-12-Val binding to platelets. His-12-Val inhibited a minor component of transmembrane Ca2+ influx into ADP and thrombin-activated human platelets but had no effect on steady-state platelet 45Ca flux. These data indicate that ligand binding may exert a regulatory influence on transmembrane Ca2+ influx into activated platelets. The difference in inhibitory potency of the peptides studied may be related to differences in conformational changes in the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex induced by His-12-Val and RGDS, steric considerations, or differences in interactions with glycoprotein IIb Ca2+ binding domains."
https://openalex.org/W1584650601,"A tetrapeptide Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) has been shown to be a versatile cell recognition signal of extracellular matrix components for the interaction with cells. We introduced the RGDS tetrapeptide into a truncated form of protein A, a staphylococcal immunoglobulin-binding protein, by inserting an oligonucleotide cassette encoding the tetrapeptide into the coding region of the protein A expression vector pRIT2T. The mutagenized protein was capable of not only binding to immunoglobulin G but also mediating cell attachment and spreading onto an inert substrate. Cell adhesion mediated by the mutagenized protein was inhibitable by a synthetic peptide Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser but not by a related peptide Gly-Arg-Gly-Glu-Ser, confirming that the inserted RGDS tetrapeptide served as a recognition signal for cell adhesion. Furthermore, the RGDS-containing protein was capable of adhering cells onto an immunoglobulin-coated surface which could not by itself support cell adhesion. Thus, the cell adhesive and immunoglobulin binding activities of the mutagenized protein appear to function coordinately. The protocol described here is essentially applicable to any protein and, therefore, provides a general principle in tailoring novel multifunctional proteins having cell adhesive activity."
https://openalex.org/W1900065912,"The length of the hydrophobic core of the bovine parathyroid hormone signal peptide was modified by in vitro mutagenesis. Extension of the hydrophobic core by three amino acids at the NH2-terminal end had little effect on the proteolytic processing of the signal peptide by microsomal membranes. Deletion of 6 of the 12 amino acids in the core eliminated translocation and processing of the modified protein. Deletion of pairs of amino acids across the core resulted in position-dependent inhibition of signal activity unrelated to hydrophobicity but inversely related to the hydrophobic moments of the modified cores. Deletions in the NH2-terminal region of the core were strongly inhibitory for proteolytic processing whereas deletions in the COOH-terminal region had no effect or increased processing when assessed either co-translationally with microsomal membranes or post-translationally with purified hen oviduct signal peptidase. Deletion of cysteine 18 and alanine 19 increased processing, but deletion of cysteine alone or substitution of leucine for cysteine did not increase processing more than deletion of both residues at 18 and 19. Translations of the translocation-defective mutants with pairs of amino acids deleted in a wheat germ system were inhibited by addition of exogenous signal recognition particle suggesting that interactions of the modified signal peptides with signal recognition particle were normal. The position-dependent effects of the hydrophobic core modifications indicate that structural properties of the core in addition to hydrophobicity are important for signal activity. The parallel effects of the modifications on co-translational translocation and post-translational processing by purified signal peptidase suggest that proteins in the signal peptidase complex might be part of, or intimately associated with, membrane proteins involved in the translocation. A model is proposed in which the NH2-terminal region of the hydrophobic core binds to one subunit of the signal peptidase while the other subunit catalyzes the cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W1512394882,"The purpose of this investigation was to study the effects of a distinct type of phospholipase C on sarcolemmal Na+-Ca2+ exchange. With this phospholipase C (Staphylococcus aureus), treatment of cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles resulted in a specific hydrolysis of membrane phosphatidylinositol. This hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol also released two proteins (110 and 36 kDa) from the sarcolemmal membrane. Phospholipase C pretreatment of the sarcolemma resulted in an unexpected stimulation of Na+-Ca2+ exchange. The Vmax of Na+-Ca2+ exchange was increased but the Km for Ca2+ was not altered. This stimulation was specific to the Na+-Ca2+ exchange pathway. ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake was depressed after phospholipase C treatment, but passive membrane permeability to Ca2+ was unaffected. Sarcolemmal Na+,K+-ATPase activity was not altered, whereas passive Ca2+ binding was modestly decreased after phospholipase C pretreatment. The stimulation of Na+-Ca2+ exchange after phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis was greater in inside-out vesicles than in a total population of vesicles of mixed orientation. This finding suggests that the cardiac sarcolemmal Na+-Ca2+ exchanger is functionally asymmetrical. The results also suggest that membrane phosphatidylinositol is inhibitory to the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger or, alternatively, this phospholipid may anchor an endogenous inhibitory protein in the sarcolemmal membrane. The observation that a transsarcolemmal Ca2+ flux pathway may be stimulated solely by phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis independently of phosphoinositide metabolic products like inositol triphosphate is novel."
https://openalex.org/W1500000190,"Abstract Deoxycytidine kinase (dC kinase) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the anabolism of important anticancer and retroviral nucleoside derivatives. Its activity is often decreased in resistance to these drugs. To analyze the structure, function, and control of this clinically important enzyme we isolated 15 cDNA clones for human deoxycytidine kinase from lambda gt11 thymus and Molt 4 libraries. Four clones were sequenced. The largest clone is 2.9 kilobases and codes for a 626-amino acid open reading frame. The DNA and deduced amino acid sequence of the human dC kinase clones are homologous with a previously unidentified murine cDNA clone p3.4J (EMBL:MM34j) reported to be related to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Deoxycytidine kinase also has cysteine-rich regions that are homologous with thioredoxin, the beta subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase, phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C, thyroid hormone-binding protein, and protein disulfide isomerase. No differences were seen in the amount and size of deoxycytidine kinase protein and mRNA between CCRF/CEM and L1210 leukemic cell lines that express and do not express enzyme activity. Genomic restriction fragments were similar between the active and inactive CCRF/CEM cell lines. These data suggest that the cells deficient in dC kinase activity have a small defect in the structural gene."
https://openalex.org/W1579034409,"Production of cAMP in response to adenosine A2 or prostaglandin E1 receptor stimulation was, but the production induced by a beta-adrenergic agonist or forskolin was not, enhanced by prior exposure of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts to agonists of Ca2+-mobilizing receptors or phorbol ester for 3 h. The enhancement reflected potentiation of the receptor-coupled activation of adenylate cyclase and the 2-fold increase in the adenosine A2 receptor number in membranes under these conditions. No enhancement was observed, however, when the medium used for the prior exposure was further supplemented with 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7) or staurosporin, inhibitors of protein kinase C, neither of which affected the cAMP responses of the nonexposed cells. It is very likely, therefore, that activation of protein kinase C triggers the increase in certain receptor density in membranes, thereby enhancing the receptor-coupled cAMP-generating responses. The physiological significance of such cross-talk between cellular signaling systems is discussed in comparison with similar previous observations."
https://openalex.org/W2152801708,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates the turnover of phosphoinositides in A431 cells. In cells that were pretreated with EGF for 30 min at 37 degrees C and then washed to remove surface-bound hormone, a 70-100% decrease in the EGF-stimulated production of inositol monophosphate, inositol bisphosphate, and inositol triphosphate was noted when the cells were exposed to the agonist a second time. Since only a 15% decrease in receptor number was observed in these pretreated cells, the loss of responsiveness to EGF for the production of inositol phosphates could not be attributed to a down-regulation of the EGF receptors. These data suggest that pretreatment of A431 cells with high concentrations of EGF leads to a desensitization of the EGF receptor. This desensitization of the receptor by EGF is apparent within 10-15 min of the addition of EGF and is maximal by 30 min. The desensitization appears to be homologous in nature since pretreatment of cells with EGF did not diminish their responsiveness to bradykinin; and conversely, pretreatment with bradykinin did not diminish the subsequent responsiveness of the cells to EGF. Desensitization to EGF was observed in cells in which protein kinase C had been down-regulated by prolonged treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, implying that EGF receptor desensitization is independent of protein kinase C. The desensitizing effects of EGF on growth factor-induced phosphatidylinositol turnover could be prevented by pretreatment of the cells with the calmodulin antagonist trifluoperazine, suggesting that calmodulin may be involved in the regulation of EGF receptor sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W1544571121,"Abstract We have selected a mutant F9 teratocarcinoma stem cell line, RA-5-1, which does not exhibit normal differentiation into parietal endoderm in the presence of retinoic acid, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, and theophylline (RACT). In this report, we demonstrate that the RA-5-1 mutant possesses a prolyl-4-hydroxylase enzyme with a higher Km for a synthetic collagen substrate and that this alteration results in a 6-7-fold reduction in the amount of collagen IV in the medium of RACT-treated mutant cells, as compared to wild type F9 cells. In addition, the collagen IV that is secreted by RACT-treated RA-5-1 cells has an abnormally low molecular weight and contains 6-9-fold less 4-hydroxyproline than the collagen IV secreted by RACT-treated wild type F9 cells. A brief ascorbate treatment can increase the hydroxyproline content of the collagen IV secreted by RACT-treated RA-5-1 cells. A large reduction in the amount of laminin in the medium of RACT-treated RA-5-1 mutant cells is also observed. Concomitant with the reduction in collagen IV and laminin polypeptides in the medium, the expression of several other differentiation-specific mRNAs is delayed in the RACT-treated RA-5-1 cells relative to wild type F9 cells. Moreover, the mutant cells do not exhibit the morphology or the complete growth arrest of wild type terminally differentiated parietal endoderm cells in the presence of RACT. These results suggest that a defect in the post-translational modification of collagen IV in the mutant RA-5-1 prevents the complete expression of the differentiation program in response to RACT. These experiments also demonstrate that the expression of certain differentiation-specific genes is compatible with continued proliferation in the mutant line."
https://openalex.org/W1628506888,"The Bacillus subtilis phage phi 105 repressor, a lambda repressor-like transcriptional regulatory protein, was overproduced in Escherichia coli and purified to near homogeneity in order to examine its in vitro DNA-binding properties. The active form of repressor appears to be a tetramer. DNase I protection experiments demonstrate that repressor can specifically bind to six distinct sites, all located within the phi 105 EcoRI-F immunity region (immF). Three of these sites had been identified earlier as functional operators by genetic analysis. They share a common 14-base pair, asymmetric core sequence, 5'-GACGGAAATACAAG-3', termed OR. The three additional sites show significant homology with OR. For an individual binding site, hydroxyl-radical footprinting reveals symmetrical repressor-DNA interactions established via one side of the helix. Dimethyl sulfate protection indicates that guanines at the conserved OR base pair positions 1, 3, and 4 may participate in sequence-specific interactions with repressor in agreement with a previously proposed recognition model. However, since the OR sequence is not symmetrical with respect to this GNCG motif, at present it remains difficult to completely understand the molecular basis of this interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1552611500,"We have used a preparation of isolated, intact rod photoreceptors to correlate the effects of flash illumination on the intracellular cyclic GMP content and the membrane current. We find that the recovery of cyclic GMP levels after brief flash illumination requires approximately twice as much time as the recovery of the membrane current. In contrast, the subsecond kinetics of the cyclic GMP response to light are faster than the kinetics of membrane current suppression. Both cyclic GMP and the membrane current show graded responses to a wide range of flash intensities; however, in a low Ca2+-Ringer's solution, dim flashes can trigger a decrease in cyclic GMP concentration with no corresponding decrease in membrane current. These results suggest that either other factors can regulate the membrane current, or that measurements of total cellular cyclic GMP do not accurately reflect dynamic changes in cyclic GMP concentration in the vicinity of the light-regulated channel. Changes in cyclic GMP concentration in the presence of background illumination exhibit adaptational behavior similar to that observed in a light-adapted photoresponse: acceleration in the response kinetics and a decrease in response amplitude. That this result is observed in rods depleted of internal Ca2+ suggests a Ca2+-independent mechanism by which background illumination can accelerate the cyclic GMP response."
https://openalex.org/W1581610261,"Abstract We have previously reported that cytochrome P-450LTB in the microsomes of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) catalyzes three omega-oxidations of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), leading to the sequential formation of 20-OH-LTB4, 20-CHO-LTB4, and 20-COOH-LTB4 (Soberman, R.J., Sutyak, J.P., Okita, R.T., Wendelborn, D.F., Roberts, L.J., II, and Austen, K. F. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 7996-8002). The identification of the novel final intermediate, 20-CHO-LTB4, allowed direct analysis of its metabolism by PMN microsomes in the presence of adenine nucleotide cofactors. Microsomes in the presence of 100 microM NAD+ or 100 microM NADP+ converted 1.0 microM 20-CHO-LTB4 to 20-COOH-LTB4 with a Km of 2.4 +/- 0.8 microM (mean +/- S.E., n = 4) and a Vmax of 813.9 +/- 136.6 pmol.min-1.mg-1, for NAD+, as compared to 0.12 microM and 5.0 pmol.min-1.mg-1 (n = 2) for NADPH as a cofactor. The conversion of 1.0 microM of 20-CHO-LTB4 to 20-COOH-LTB4 in the presence of saturating concentrations (1.0 mM) of both NAD+ and NADP+ was not greater than the reaction in the presence of 1.0 mM of each cofactor separately, indicating that NAD+ and NADP+ were cofactors for the same enzyme. Antibody to cytochrome P-450 reductase did not inhibit the conversion of 20-CHO-LTB4 to 20-COOH-LTB4. When 1.0 microM 20-OH-LTB4 was added to microsomes in the presence of NADPH, approximately three-fourths of the product formed (63.7 +/- 5.1 pmol; mean +/- S.E., n = 3) was 20-CHO-LTB4 and approximately one-fourth (21.3 +/- 3.9 pmol; mean +/- S.E., n = 3) was 20-COOH-LTB4. In the presence of both NADPH and NAD+, only 20-COOH-LTB4 (85.5 +/- 9.9 pmol; mean +/- S.E., n = 3) was formed. PMN microsomes also contain an NADH-dependent aldehyde reductase which converts 20-CHO-LTB4 to 20-OH-LTB4, a member of the LTB4 family of molecules with biological activity. Based upon kinetic, cofactor and inhibition data, microsomal aldehyde dehydrogenase preferentially regulates the final and irreversible inactivation step in the LTB4 metabolic sequence."

The inhibitor protein does not inhibit type 1 phosphatase when either phosphorylase or hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase is the substrate. In contrast, this protein inhibitor inhibits the rat liver type 2A phosphatase activity when hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase is the substrate but not when phosphorylase a is the substrate. The inhibitor protein is not activated by incubation with ATP and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and it is not phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase-3. These results, together with those of the kinetic experiments, suggest that the reductase phosphatase inhibitor is distinct from protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 and inhibitor-2."
https://openalex.org/W1517017662,"Abstract The yeast SOC8-1 gene was originally identified by partial complementation of cdc8 mutant strains. We have carried out Bal31 deletion analysis of the SOC8-1 gene to define the minimal size which is required for the complementation of the cdc8 mutation. When the SOC8-1 gene is cloned in a multicopy plasmid, it enables temperature-resistant growth in the cdc8 mutant strain, while the SOC8-1 gene in a single copy plasmid does not. Thus, its suppression of the cdc8 mutant is dosage dependent. The high copy number vector carrying the SOC8-1 gene can complement five different cdc8 alleles, indicating that the suppression is not allele specific. Since CDC8 encodes thymidylate kinase, cells bearing a high copy number plasmid containing SOC8-1 gene were tested for the ability to phosphorylate several nucleoside monophosphates, including UMP, GMP and dTMP. Significantly increased phosphorylation activity was observed, suggesting that SOC8-1 encodes a nucleotide kinase. Both restriction enzyme analysis of the SOC8-1 gene and partial purification of the overproduced kinase in SOC8-1 overproducing strains suggest that SOC8-1 may be allelic with URA6. Consistent with these results, both SOC8-1 and URA6 are located on chromosome XI. Thus, one possible suppression mechanism is that SOC8-1 may provide a trans-acting dTMP kinase activity, bypassing the cdc8 gene defect."
