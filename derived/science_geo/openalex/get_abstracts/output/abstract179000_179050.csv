In this study we show that myostatin is an inhibitor of myoblast differentiation and that this inhibition is mediated through Smad 3.In vitro, increasing concentrations of recombinant mature myostatin reversibly blocked the myogenic differentiation of myoblasts, cultured in low serum media. Western and Northern blot analysis indicated that addition of myostatin to the low serum culture media repressed the levels of MyoD, Myf5, myogenin, and p21 leading to the inhibition of myogenic differentiation. The transient transfection of C2C12 myoblasts with MyoD expressing constructs did not rescue myostatin-inhibited myogenic differentiation. Myostatin signaling specifically induced Smad 3 phosphorylation and increased Smad 3·MyoD association, suggesting that Smad 3 may mediate the myostatin signal by interfering with MyoD activity and expression. Consistent with this, the expression of dominant-negativeSmad3 rescued the activity of a MyoD promoter-reporter in C2C12 myoblasts treated with myostatin. Taken together, these results suggest that myostatin inhibits MyoD activity and expression via Smad 3 resulting in the failure of the myoblasts to differentiate into myotubes. Thus we propose that myostatin plays a critical role in myogenic differentiation and that the muscular hyperplasia and hypertrophy seen in animals that lack functional myostatin is because of deregulated proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts.

Expression of a differentiated skeletal muscle phenotype involves the initial determination of mesoderm cells toward the myogenic lineage followed by their proliferation and irreversible withdrawal from the cell cycle. Concomitant with this is the expression of muscle-specific genes, culminating in the formation of differentiated multinucleated myotubes. Specification of the myogenic lineage and differentiation of skeletal muscle cells are critically dependent on the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors MyoD, Myf5, myogenin, and MRF4, collectively known as the MyoD family muscle regulatory factors (MRFs) 1The abbreviations used are: MRF, muscle regulatory factors; cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; MHC, myosin heavy chain; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcriptase; HS, horse serum (for reviews see Refs. 1Tapscott S.J.

In fact, each of the MRFs has the ability to convert nonmuscle cell types into differentiation-competent myogenic cells after forced expression (6Braun T. Buschhausen-Denker G. Bober E. Tannich E.

Studies into the function of MRFs have revealed a genetic hierarchy in which MyoD and Myf5 are involved in the determination of the myogenic lineage whereas myogenin and MRF4 serve to control the process of terminal differentiation (3Megeney L.A. Rudnicki M.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 723-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 4Ludolph D.C. Konieczny S.F.

Although MyoD and Myf5 are said to be involved in the specification of the myogenic lineage, they nevertheless also appear to play an important role in initiating myoblast differentiation. Once activated, MyoD and Myf5 induce the expression of myogenin and transcription factors from the myocyte enhancer factor-2 family. MyoD also induces the withdrawal of myoblasts from the cell cycle, an integral part of myogenic differentiation (10Crescenzi M. Fleming T.P. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8442-8446Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 11Sorrentino V. Pepperkok R. Davis R.L. Ansorge W. Philipson L. Nature. 1990; 345: 813-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitors p21 and p57, which negatively regulate cell cycle progression through the inhibition of the cell cycle machinery, play an important role in this process. Indeed high levels of p21 and p57 are expressed during embryonic skeletal muscle differentiation as well as in myogenic cells induced to differentiate in vitro(12Zhang P. Wong C. Liu D. Finegold M.

Life Sci. 2001; 58: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Connecting MyoD to the cell cycle are reports demonstrating that MyoD is, in part, responsible for the up-regulation ofp21 seen in differentiating muscle cells (14Guo K. Wang J. Andres V. Smith R.C.

Serum and peptide growth factors, such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and fibroblast growth factor (17Olson E.N. Sternberg E. Hu J.S. Spizz G. Wilcox C. J.

Myostatin is a growth and differentiation factor (GDF8), belonging to the TGF-β superfamily, which acts as a negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass (23McPherron A.C. Lawler A.M. Lee S.J.

(23McPherron A.C. Lawler A.M. Lee S.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (3222) Google Scholar), the deletion of myostatin in mice was shown to cause a dramatic and widespread increase in skeletal muscle, the result of both hyperplasia and hypertrophy of muscle fibers. The myostatin-null mice appeared to phenocopy the double muscling seen in certain breeds of cattle, such as Belgian Blue and Piedmontese, and mutations were subsequently identified in the coding region of myostatin in these breeds (27Kambadur R. Sharma M. Smith T.P. Bass J.J. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 910-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 28McPherron A.C. Lee S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genome. 1998; 9: 210-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Myostatin shares several structural similarities to other TGF-β family members. It contains a hydrophobic N terminus that acts as a secretory signal and a conserved RSRR domain that is important for proteolytic processing (23McPherron A.C. Lawler A.M. Lee S.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (3222) Google Scholar, 24Thomas M. Langley B. Berry C. Sharma M. Kirk S. Bass J. Kambadur R. J. Biol.

Cleavage of protein gives rise to an N-terminal latency associated peptide and C-terminal mature signaling peptide. The mature signaling peptide binds to the receptor, suggested to be activin type II receptor, to elicit its biological function (30Lee S.J. McPherron A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9306-9311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). Indeed, recombinant myostatin based on the mature signaling portion has been shown to be biologically active in repressing the proliferation of cultured myoblast cells (24Thomas M. Langley B. Berry C. Sharma M. Kirk S. Bass J. Kambadur R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40235-40243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Mature myostatin arrests cultured primary bovine and transformed C2C12 myoblasts in the G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle, via retinoblastoma protein hypophosphorylation. This is caused by the up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitorp21 and down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (Cdk2) levels and activity (24Thomas M. Langley B. Berry C. Sharma M. Kirk S. Bass J. Kambadur R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40235-40243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that in addition to proliferation, myostatin also negatively regulates myoblast differentiation. We show that C2C12 myoblasts cultured with myostatin do not undergo morphological or biochemical myogenic differentiation. The degree of differentiation inhibition is dependent on the concentration of myostatin and myoblasts readily differentiate upon removal of myostatin from the media. The inhibition of differentiation by myostatin is associated with decreased expression of the myogenic determining genes; myoD, myf5,myogenin, and p21 and could not be rescued following the transfection of a MyoD expressing vector. In addition we also show that myostatin signaling specifically induces Smad 3 phosphorylation and increases the interaction of Smad 3 with MyoD. Furthermore, dominant-negative Smad 3 interferes with the myostatin down-regulation of the myoD promoter. This report adds to the proposed model for skeletal muscle regulation in vertebrates. In addition to being a key regulator of myoblast proliferation, myostatin also regulates myoblast differentiation. Thus, the loss of functional myostatin results in the hypertrophy and hyperplasia of skeletal muscle that is seen inmyostatin-null mice and myostatin-mutant cattle. The subcloning and expression of myostatin protein inE. coli has previously been described (24Thomas M. Langley B. Berry C. Sharma M. Kirk S. Bass J. Kambadur R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40235-40243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pET protein expression system (Novagen) was used to express and purify recombinant myostatin. Bovine myostatin cDNA (amino acids 267–375) was PCR amplified and cloned into the pET 16-B vector (Novagen) in-frame with the 10 histidine residues. An overnight BL21 E. coli culture transformed with the recombinant myostatin expression vector was diluted and grown to an OD of 0.8 (600 nm) in 1 liter of Lennox L broth (LB) medium plus ampicillin (50 mg/liter). The myostatin fusion protein was induced by 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h. Harvested bacteria were resuspended in 40 ml of lysis buffer (6m guanidine hydrochloride, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), sonicated, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. Myostatin was purified from the supernatant by Ni-agarose affinity chromatography (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Soluble fractions containing myostatin were pooled and dialyzed against two changes of 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 500 mm NaCl and 10% glycerol for 6 h. C2C12 myoblasts were grown prior to assay in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen), buffered with 41.9 mm NaHCO3(Sigma) and 5% gaseous CO2. 7.22 nm Phenol red (Sigma) was used as a pH indicator. 1 × 105 IU/liter penicillin (Sigma), 100 mg/liter streptomycin (Sigma), and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen) were added to media. For assaying, C2C12 myoblasts were seeded on Thermonox coverslips (Nunc) at a density of 20,000 cells/cm2. Following a 16-h attachment period test media consisting of DMEM containing 2% horse serum (DMEM, 2% HS) with or without 0–10 μg/ml recombinant myostatin was added. Plates were incubated in at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for a further 72 h. Bovine myoblast cultures were derived and enriched fromMusculus semitendinosus of 160-day fetuses as previously described (24Thomas M. Langley B. Berry C. Sharma M. Kirk S. Bass J. Kambadur R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40235-40243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar) resulting in cultures of at least 90% myoblast purity. Purified bovine primary myoblast cultures were grown prior to assay in minimal essential medium (MEM; Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS for 24 h before trypsinization and seeding onto coverslips. After a 16-h attachment period, media was replaced with test media consisting of MEM containing 2% HS with or without 8 μg/ml myostatin for 72 h. C2C12 myoblasts were seeded onto Nunc Thermonox coverslips at a density of 20,000 cells/cm2. After a 16-h attachment period, DMEM, 2% HS media with or without 8 μg/ml myostatin was added to cultures. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 72 h, after which the media was replaced with fresh media for a further 72 h. Cultures to have myostatin inhibition ”reversed“ received DMEM, 2% HS media without myostatin for a further 72 h. The method of Kitzmann et al. (31Kitzmann M. Carnac G. Vandromme M. Primig M. Lamb N.J. Fernandez A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1447-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) was used to separate myotubes from reserve cells in differentiated C2C12 cultures. C2C12myoblasts were seeded onto 10-cm Nunc culture dishes at a density of 20,000 cells/cm2 and allowed to attach over a 16-h period. Differentiation media (DMEM, 2% FBS) with or without 5 μg/ml myostatin was added and cultures were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 96 h. Following incubation, a short trypsinization period (5 min, 0.15% trypsin) and 2× phosphate-buffered saline washes was used to preferentially detach myotubes. Reserve cells, which remained attached to the culture dish, were then detached by a 10-min incubation with 0.25% trypsin. Myoblasts were fixed with 70% ethanol:formaldehyde:glacial acetic acid (20:2:1) for 30 s, then rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were blocked overnight at 4 °C in TBS (0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.6 (Sigma); 0.15 m NaCl) containing 1% normal sheep serum. Cells were incubated with primary antibody, 1:100 dilution anti-MHC (MF20; gift of Donald Fischman, Cornell University Medical College), in TBS, 1% normal sheep serum for 1 h. Cells were washed (3 × 5 min) with TBST (TBS; 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated with secondary antibody, 1:100 dilution sheep anti-mouse IgG (AmershamBiosciences), in TBS, 1% normal sheep serum for 30 min. Cells were washed as before and incubated with tertiary antibody, 1:100 dilution of streptavidin-biotin peroxidase complex (AmershamBiosciences), in TBS, 1% normal sheep serum for 30 min. MHC immunostaining was visualized using 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Invitrogen) enhanced with 0.0375% CoCl. MHC-immunostained cultures were lightly counterstained with Gill's hematoxylin and photographed using an Olympus BX50 microscope (Olympus Optical Co., Germany) fitted with a DAGE-MTI DC-330 color camera (DAGE-MTI Inc., Michigan City, IN). For MyoD-V5 immunoprecipitation and quantitative MyoD, Myf5, myogenin, MHC, and p21 immunoblot analyses, mouse C2C12 myoblasts were cultured as described above in 6-well plates or 100-mm dishes according to treatment. Cells (∼3 × 106) were resuspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and sonicated or passed through a syringe. The cell extracts were centrifuged to pellet cell debris. Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) was used to estimate total protein content to ensure equal loadings. Immunoprecipitation of MyoD-V5 was performed by incubating 100 μg of total protein with 2 μg of purified mouse monoclonal anti-V5 antibody (R960-25; Invitrogen) in 100 μl of extraction buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A-agarose (Invitrogen) (50 μl of 50%, washed twice with lysis buffer) was added for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation to pellet immunoprecipitated complexes. After centrifugation, pellets were washed five times with lysis buffer. Pellets were then resuspended in 20 μl of 4× NuPAGE sample buffer (Novex) and boiled for 5 min. Total protein (15 μg) or immunoprecipitations (5–10 μl) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (4–12% gradient; Novex) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting. The membranes were blocked in TBST, 5% milk at 4 °C overnight, then incubated with the primary antibody for 3 h at room temperature. The following primary antibodies were used for immunoblotting: p130, 1:500 dilution of purified rabbit polyclonal anti-p130 antibody (sc317); MyoD, 1:200 dilution of purified rabbit polyclonal anti-MyoD antibody (sc304; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) or 1:150 dilution of purified mouse monoclonal anti-MyoD antibody (554130; Pharmingen); Myf5, 1:200 dilution of purified rabbit polyclonal anti-Myf5 antibody (sc302; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.); myogenin, 1:200 dilution of purified rabbit polyclonal anti-myogenin antibody (sc576; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.); MHC, 1:2000 dilution of purified mouse monoclonal anti-MHC antibody (MF-20; gift of Donald Fischman); p21, 1:400 dilution of purified mouse monoclonal anti-p21 antibody (SX118; Pharmingen); p-Smad 2/3, 1:150 dilution of purified rabbit polyclonal anti-p-Smad 2/3 antibody (sc11769; Pharmingen); Smad 3-FLAG, 1:500 dilution of purified mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (F-3165; Sigma); α-tubulin, 1:3000 dilution of purified mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody (DM 1A; Sigma). The membranes were washed (5 times for 5 min) with TBST and further incubated with anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate, 1:2000 dilution (W402B; Promega Corp.), anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate, 1:1000 dilution (P0448; DAKO), or anti-goat IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate, 1:5000 dilution (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.), secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed as above, and horseradish peroxidase activity was detected using Renaissance Western blot chemiluminescence (NEL104; Invitrogen). The expression construct for the dominant-negative Smad 2 S465A,S467A mutant was a gift from Dr. Serhiy Souchelnytskyi and has been previously described (32Souchelnytskyi S. Tamaki K. Engstrom U.

Dominant-negative Smad 3 was generated by a site-directed PCR mutagenesis approach to introduce mutations S423A and S425A, and cloned into the pcDNA3.1 D/V5-His TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The following PCR primers were used for this amplification, 5′-CACCATGTGGTCCATCCTGCCTTTC-3′ and 5′-AGCCACAGCGGAACAGCGG-3′. The MyoD expression construct was generated by the RT-PCR amplification of the coding region of MyoD and its subsequent cloning into the pcDNA3.1 D/V5-His TOPO vector. The following PCR primers were used for this amplification, 5′-CACCATGGAGCTTCTATC-3′ and 5′-AAGCACCTGATAAATCGC-3′. Murine C57 total RNA was used as the RT template. The Smad 3-FLAG expression construct was a gift from Dr. Rik Derynck and has been described by Choy et al. (33Choy L. Skillington J. Derynck R. J.

The p3TP-lux reporter construct was a gift from Dr. Joan Massague and the 2.7-kb myoD promoter-luciferase reporter construct (pJH17) was a gift from Dr. John Capone. Both have been previously described (34Carcamo J. Zentella A. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Hunter J.G. van Delft M.F. Rachubinski R.A. Capone J.P.

A 4.3-kb fragment, containing the 2.4-kb p21 genomic fragment containing bases −2,300 to +8 with respect to the transcription start site in pGL3 basic, was subcloned as a NotI/XbaI fragment (to include the luciferase gene) into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), which had been modified, by NruI/BamHI digestion and religation, to remove the cytomegalovirus promoter. Constructs were transfected into C2C12 cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. For stably expressing cell lines, stable integrants were selected with Geneticin (Invitrogen) at 0.4 mg/ml for 4 weeks. Cell culture, myoblast differentiation, and myostatin treatment were performed as described above. C2C12 myoblasts were harvested for protein and the luciferase assay was done using the Luciferase kit (Promega) according to manufacturer's protocol. Luciferase activity in the lysates (10 μl) was measured on a Berthold luminometer, integrating light emission over 20 s. Luciferase activities were normalized to total protein content or β-galactosidase expression from the transfection of the SV40-β-galactosidase control vector, pCH110 (Amersham Biosciences), prior to treatment. Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) was used, as described above, to determine protein concentration, whereas the β-galactosidase assay system (Promega) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol to determine β-galactosidase activity. RNA was isolated from cultured cells using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Northern analysis was performed essentially as described by Sambrook et al. (37Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total RNA (12 μg) was fractionated by 0.66 m formaldehyde, 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. RNA was transferred to Hybond N+ membrane (AmershamBiosciences) by capillary transfer using 10× SSC. The membrane was prehybridized in Church and Gilbert hybridization buffer (0.5m Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, 7% SDS, 1 mm EDTA) at 60 °C for 1 h, followed by hybridization with 32P-labeled cDNA probes in fresh Church and Gilbert hybridization buffer at 60 °C overnight. The membrane was washed at 60 °C for 15 min each with 2× SSC + 0.5% SDS, and then 1× SSC + 0.5% SDS. The myoD, myf5, myogenin, and p21cDNAs were obtained by RT-PCR from C2C12total RNA using SuperScript II (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR was performed with 2 μl of the RT reaction at 94 °C for 20 s, 55 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for 35 cycles. This was followed by a single 72 °C extension step for 5 min. The primers used were: MyoD, 5′-GAGGATCCGATGGAGCTTCTATCG-3′ and 5′-CGGATCCTCTCAAAGCACCTGATA-3′ (974 bp); Myf5, 5′-GAGGATCCGATGGACATGACGGAC-3′ and 5′-CGGATCCTCTCATAATACGTGATA-3′ (786 bp); p21, 5′-CTGTTAGGCTGGTCTGCCTC-3′ and 5′-GTCCGATCCTGGTGATGTCC-3′ (443 bp). Probe cDNAs were radioactively labeled using [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) and Rediprime II labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's protocol. We recently showed that myostatin inhibits myoblast proliferation and the loss of this inhibition is suggested to account for the increased muscle fibers (hyperplasia) because of the increased number of myoblasts. Although these results alluded to the possible role of myostatin during myogenic differentiation, to date no experimental evidence is documented. Thus to determine the effect of myostatin on myoblast differentiation, proliferating C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in differentiation media (containing 2% HS) with varying concentrations of exogenous myostatin and analyzed for their ability to undergo myogenic differentiation. After 3 days of incubation in differentiation media, control C2C12 cells that were not treated with myostatin showed extensive formation of multinucleated myotubes and were positive for MHC expression (Fig.1, A, a, andB,a). By contrast, C2C12cells treated with 8 or 10 μg/ml myostatin showed neither myotube formation nor MHC expression (Fig. 1, A,e andf, and B,b). Treatment of C2C12 cells with lower concentrations of myostatin permitted some myotube formation (Fig. 1, A,b–d). These results show that myostatin inhibits C2C12 myoblast differentiation and furthermore, this inhibition is dose-dependent. To confirm the differentiation inhibitory effect of myostatin on myoblasts, primary bovine myoblasts from 160-day-old fetuses were also cultured in differentiation media with or without myostatin for 3 days. Again nontreated control myoblasts showed extensive formation of multinucleated myotubes that were MHC positive (Fig.1 B,c). Treatment with myostatin, however, inhibited myotube formation and MHC expression (Fig.1 B,d). These results clearly show that myostatin inhibits myoblasts from carrying out the myogenic differentiation program. The mature portions of TGF-β family members bind to their respective receptors to initiate a signal cascade and biological response. Hence, in an in vitro bioassay, once the ligand is removed, the biological response, such as the differentiation block by myostatin, should also be removed. To address the question of whether myoblast differentiation inhibition is reversible, C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in differentiation media and treated with myostatin (8 μg/ml) for 72 h. As before, C2C12 myoblasts treated with myostatin were differentiation inhibited compared with nontreated C2C12 myoblasts (Fig.2, a and b). After 72 h, myostatin was removed and the cells were cultured for a further 72 h in differentiation media. As can be seen in Fig.2 d, the removal of myostatin after 72 h resulted in the myoblasts undergoing myogenic differentiation. By comparison, differentiation of the C2C12 myoblasts continued to be inhibited when myostatin was added throughout the duration of the experiment (Fig. 2 c). Results of this experiment show that myoblast differentiation is not irreversibly inhibited by myostatin, as myoblasts indeed retain the capacity to differentiate after myostatin is removed. During myoblast differentiation, a subset of myoblasts, termed reserve cells, remain quiescent and undifferentiated but retain"

To assess the relative affinity between each of the protomers, BRET saturation experiments were carried out in HEK-293T cells. β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors were found to have similar propensity to engage in homo- and heterotropic interactions suggesting that, at equivalent expression levels of the two receptor subtypes, an equal proportion of homo- and heterodimers would form.

In the past few years, many studies indicated that GPCR dimerization can occur between two identical receptors (homodimerization), between two different receptor subtypes of the same family, or even between receptors that are only distantly related (heterodimerization) (for a review, see Refs. 1Bouvier M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 274-286Google Scholar and 2Angers S. Salahpour A. Bouvier M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 409-435Google Scholar). In most instances, co-immunoprecipitation was used as the primary experimental evidence supporting the existence of such dimers. More recently, however, light resonance energy transfer techniques such as fluorescence and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (FRET and BRET) were also used. These “non-invasive” proximity-based assays confirmed that GPCR dimerization does not represent biochemical artifacts due to receptor solubilization and can occur in living cells. They have been used to demonstrate homodimerization of the β2-adrenergic (3Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

An advantage of BRET and FRET over co-immunoprecipitation approaches lies in the more quantitative nature of the assay. However, relatively few studies exploited this quantitative potential for the study of GPCR dimerization. For the melatonin receptors, Ayoub et al. (11Ayoub M.A. Couturier C. Lucas-Meunier E. Angers S. Fossier P. Bouvier M. Jockers R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21522-21528Google Scholar) recently used BRET competition assays to determine that the transfer of energy resulted from the formation of dimers and not of higher order oligomers. They also showed that ligand binding did not alter the dimerization state of the receptors. However, other questions that could theoretically be addressed by quantitative energy transfer analysis, such as the relative affinity of the dimer partners for each other and the relative proportion of receptors engaging in dimer formation, have not yet been addressed. β2- and β1-adrenergic receptors (β2AR and β1AR) have previously been shown to exist as homodimers (3Angers S.

The high level of sequence identity existing in domains proposed to contribute to the dimerization interface (i.e. transmembrane helices) (14Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.P. Loisel T.P.

Chem. 1998; 273: 30244-30248Google Scholar) makes them a system of choice to study their potential heterodimerization and the relative affinity of the protomers within homo- and heterotropic complexes. Although direct in vivo demonstration for the co-localization of the two receptor subtypes in the same cell is still lacking, the presence of β1 and β2AR in the same cell types has been taken as evidence for their co-expression in transitional and mid-nodal cells of the atrio-ventricular node, nerve processes of the atrio-ventricular and ventricular conduction systems, as well as in vascular smooth muscle cells of the kidney (17Petrecca K. Shrier A. J. Anat. 1998; 192: 517-528Google Scholar, 18Boivin V. Jahns R. Gambaryan S. Ness W. Boege F. Lohse M.J. Kidney Int. 2001; 59: 515-531Google Scholar). The fact that the two receptor subtypes are also found together in a large number of tissues, including liver, lung, and fat (19Sano M. Yoshimasa T. Yagura T. Yamamoto I. Life Sci. 1993; 52: 1063-1070Google Scholar), gives further support to the idea that heterodimerization could occur in native tissues and warrants investigations aiming to assess the likelihood of such intermolecular complexes. Here, quantitative BRET approaches were applied to the study of β1- and β2-adrenergic receptor dimerization in a heterologous mammalian expression system. In particular, BRET saturation experiments were carried out to estimate the relative affinity of each receptor subtype to engage into homo- and heterotropic interactions. The influence of receptor density on the proportion of receptor molecules forming dimers was also assessed. Here, we report that β1AR and β2AR can form homo- and heterodimers and that the two receptors have similar affinities for each other and for themselves, suggesting that heterodimers are likely to form in cells expressing both subtypes. The proportion of receptor molecules forming dimers was also found to be greater than 80% at low receptor density and was constant over a 20-fold expression range. The β1AR coding sequence without its stop codon was amplified from the pBC12BI-human β1AR plasmid (20Frielle T. Collins S. Daniel K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7920-7924Google Scholar) using sense and antisense primers harboring unique SacI and AgeI sites. The fragment was then subcloned in-frame into theSacI/AgeI site of the blue variant GFP-sapphire vector (pGFP-N1-Sapphire, Packard Bioscience) to give the plasmid pGFP-N1-β1AR-Sapphire. Finally, the GFP-Sapphire was replaced by a green GFP variant (GFP10) containing the following mutations: P64L, S147P, and S202P. For this purpose, anAgeI/BsrgI fragment of the GFP10 variant was subcloned into the AgeI/BsrgI site of pGFP-N1-β1AR-Sapphire to finally yield pGFP-N1-β1AR-GFP10. The GFP10AgeI/BsrgI fragment was subcloned into theAgeI/BsrgI site of pGFP-N1-Hisβ2AR-YFP (3Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3684-3689Google Scholar). For simplicity, GFP10 will be referred to as GFP in the remainder of the text. The pcDNA3.1-β1AR:6aa:hRluc was a generous gift from BioSignal Packard. This fusion protein contains a linker of six amino acids (YGPPGS) linking the carboxyl tail of the human β1AR and the humanized Rluc. The humanized Rluc coding sequence (pRluc(h), Packard Bioscience) was amplified using sense and antisense primers and subcloned into the PCR Blunt II Topo vector (Invitrogen). The hRluc fragment was excised by digestion with KpnI/XbaI and subcloned into theKpnI/XbaI-digested pcDNA3.1 Zeo vector to generate the pcDNA3.1 Zeo/hRluc plasmid. The human Hisβ2AR coding sequence was amplified without its stop codon using sense and antisense primers. The PCR product was subcloned into PCR Blunt II Topo Vector, then excised by double digestion withHindIII/KpnI and ligated into theHindIII/KpnI-digested expression vector pcDNA3.1Zeo/hRluc. The resulting construct encodes a six-amino acid linker (GSGTGS) between the carboxyl-terminal of the β2AR and the humanized Rluc sequence. HEK-293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine (all from Wisent). For transfection experiments, cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 106 cells per 100-mm dish and cultured for 24 h. Transient transfections were then performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation protocol (21Mellon P.L. Parker V. Gluzman Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1981; 27: 279-288Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was replaced, and the cells were then cultured in the same medium for an additional 24 h. Forty-height hours post-transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS, detached with PBS/EDTA and resuspended in PBS/glucose 0.1%. On a routine basis, the protein concentration of the samples was determined to control for the number of cells using the Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. We have used a slight modification of the previously published BRET assay (3Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3684-3689Google Scholar, 22Xu Y. Piston D.W. Johnson C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 151-156Google Scholar). The new BRET2 technology (BioSignal Packard) takes advantage of the spectral properties of a luciferase substrate known as Deep Blue coelenterazine (DeepBlueC, Packard Bioscience), which allows a better separation between theRenilla luciferase (Rluc) and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) emission spectra. Upon the catalytic degradation of DeepBlueC, the energy donor Rluc emits light with a peak at 400 nm that allows the excitation of the energy acceptor, GFP. Once excited, GFP then re-emits fluorescence with a peak at 510 nm if the donor and acceptor molecules are within BRET-permissive distance (<100 Å). Following harvesting, cells were distributed in 96-well microplates (white Optiplate from Packard Bioscience) at a density of ∼100,000 cells per well. DeepBlueC was added at a final concentration of 5 μm, and readings were collected using a modified Top-count apparatus (BRETCount, Packard Bioscience) that allows the sequential integration of the signals detected in the 370- to 450-nm and 500- to 530-nm windows using filters with the appropriate band pass (Chroma). The BRET signal is determined by calculating the ratio of the light emitted by the Receptor-GFP (500–530 nm) over the light emitted by the Receptor-Rluc (370–450 nm). The values were corrected by subtracting the background signal detected when the Receptor-Rluc constructs were expressed alone. Cells were distributed in 96-well microplates (white Costar plate with clear bottom) at a density of ∼100,000 cells per well. The total fluorescence of cells was measured using a FluoroCount (Packard Bioscience) with an excitation filter at 400 nm, an emission filter at 510 nm, and the following parameters: gain, 1; photo multiplicator tube, 1100 V; time, 1.0 s. After the fluorescence measurement, the same cells were incubated for 10 min with Coelenterazine H (Molecular Probe) at a final concentration of 5 μm, and the total luminescence of cells was measured using a LumiCount (Packard Bioscience) with the following parameters: gain, 1; photo multiplicator tube, 700 V; time, 0.5 s. For both measurements, the mean of duplicate wells was calculated. The total fluorescence was then divided by the background determined in wells containing untransfected cells. Fluorescence was expressed in -fold over background. The background was negligible for the luminescence measurements, so they were expressed as absolute values. Forty-eight hours after transfection, ∼10,000 cells (2 μg of proteins) were incubated in a final volume of 500 μl of PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin with a saturating concentration (250 pm) of the β-adrenergic antagonist [125I]cyanopindolol ([125I]CYP). Nonspecific binding was determined as the residual binding observed in the presence of 10 μm alprenolol (Sigma). Binding reactions were carried out at room temperature for 90 min and stopped by rapid filtration over Whatman GF/C glass-fiber filters. Receptor densities are expressed in femtomoles of receptor per milligram of total cell proteins assuming one binding site per receptor molecule. Linear regression curves between the luminescence and fluorescence signals and the number of receptor determined by radio-ligand binding were then generated from cells expressing each of the constructs individually. To determine receptor surface density, the surface of HEK-293T cells was determined by measuring the average length and width of the cells under phase-contrast microscopy. Given that the correlations between receptor numbers and the luminescence or fluorescence levels were intrinsic characteristics of each of the constructs, comparison between receptor densities derived from the light measurements required a correcting factor. This correction was achieved using the linear regression generated for each constructs (see legend of Fig. 2) and by normalizing the light emission/receptor number as a function of the steeper slope factor obtained for both Rluc and GFP. These corrected receptor number values were then used to generate the corrected BRET saturation curves presented in Fig. 3.Figure 3A and B, corrected BRET saturation curves. The fluorescence and luminescence data from Fig. 1were transformed into receptor numbers using equations from Fig. 2 and taking the slope factor into account as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” The BRET levels are plotted as a function of the ratio of [receptor-GFP]/[receptor-Rluc]. The total number of receptors expressed ranged as follows: β1AR/β1AR, 0.8–23 pmol/mg; β1AR/β2AR, 0.8–17 pmol/mg; β2AR/β1AR, 0.3–37 pmol/mg; and β2AR/β2AR, 0.3–8 pmol/mg. The curves were fitted using a non-linear regression equation assuming a single binding site (GraphPad Prism). C, schematic representation of the distribution of the energy donor (Receptor-Rluc) and acceptor (Receptor-GFP) in the case of random collision (upper panel) versus dimerization (lower panel) when the density of energy donor is maintained constant while that of the acceptor is increased. D, modeling of the evolution of BRET resulting form random collision between energy donor and acceptor (“bystander BRET”) as a function of increased acceptor surface density for donor surface densities of 30, 300, and 3000 receptors/μm2. We simulated this process using a Monte-Carlo approach based on the assumption of random distribution. For each incremental increase of receptor-GFP, we modeled the probability P of interaction with any receptor-Rluc as P = 1 − (1 − p)n, wherep is defined as the ratio of the BRET permissive surface of the receptor-Rluc (π·50Å2) over the total calculated surface of the cell and n is the number of remaining receptor-Rluc available. The experimental data of β2AR-Rluc/β2AR-GFP presented inB are also compared with the expected BRET saturation curve for trimeric and dimeric complexes using an equation that describes the probability of forming BRET competent complexes, BRET competent complex = (n·d n−1·a +n·d·a n−1)/(n·d n+ n·d n−1·a +n·d·a n−1), where n is the number of receptor molecule in the complex,d is the number of receptor-Rluc (energy donor), and a the number of receptor-GFP (energy acceptor). The curves expressed as percent maximal BRET are plotted as a function of the [receptor-GFP]/[receptor-Rluc] ratio.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Homo- and heterodimerization of the β1 and β2AR were investigated by quantitative BRET analysis. For this purpose, human β1 and β2AR cDNAs were fused at their carboxyl terminus to the energy donorRluc and acceptor GFP. The affinities of the fusion proteins for the antagonist cyanopindolol and the agonist isoproterenol as well as the potency of isoproterenol to stimulate adenylyl cyclase were indistinguishable from those of the wild-type receptors (data not shown). BRET and FRET approaches have been used in several studies to assess GPCR homo- and heterodimerization (2Angers S. Salahpour A. Bouvier M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 409-435Google Scholar). In most cases, little attention has been paid to the ratio of donor/acceptor molecules that was used in the assays, and thus the interpretation of the data remained rather qualitative. However, controlling this parameter is essential for proper quantitative analysis. Indeed, the level of energy transfer detected for a given concentration of donor should rise with increasing concentration of the acceptor until all donor molecules are engaged by an acceptor. It follows that the energy transfer should reach a plateau and that saturation curves could theoretically be constructed. The maximal level reached should be a function of the total number of dimers formed and of the distance between the donor and acceptor within the dimers, whereas the concentration of acceptor giving 50% of energy transfer (BRET50) should be a reflection of the relative affinity of the acceptor fusion for the donor fusion proteins. Here, we applied this theoretical framework to the study of β1 and β2AR homo- and heterodimerization by constructing BRET saturation curves in cells co-transfected with a constant amount of receptor-Rluc construct and increasing concentrations of the receptor-GFP plasmids. As shown in Fig.1, significant BRET signals were observed for the β2AR/β2AR and β1AR/β1AR pairs confirming previous findings that both receptor subtypes can form homodimers (3Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3684-3689Google Scholar, 14Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.P. Loisel T.P. Bichet D.G. Barret C. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16384-16392Google Scholar, 15Xu J. Paquet M. Lau A.G. Wood J.D. Ross C.A. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41310-41317Google Scholar). Albeit to a lower extent, co-expression of the two subtypes also led to a sizable BRET signal for the two transfer orientations (i.e.β1AR-Rluc/β2AR-GFP and β2AR-Rluc/β1AR-GFP). In all cases, BRET increased as a hyperbolic function of the concentration of the GFP fusion construct added (assessed by the fluorescence emitted upon direct excitation at 400 nm) reaching an asymptote at the highest concentrations used. Co-expression of β2 or β1AR-Rluc with soluble GFP led to marginal signals that increased linearly with increasing amount of GFP added. Stimulation with the agonist isoproterenol did not promote any consistent change in the BRET saturation curves (data not shown) indicating that the dimers form constitutively and that receptor activation does not affect their oligomerization state. However, one cannot exclude the possibility that agonist stimulation could promote assembly/disassembly cycles that do not affect the steady-state proportion of receptors engaged in dimers. The modest agonist-promoted increase in BRET, previously reported for the β2AR homodimer using BRET1 (3Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3684-3689Google Scholar), most likely reflected conformational changes that could not be detected using BRET2. Indeed, the better resolution between the emission peaks of Rluc and GFP with BRET2 discussed under “Experimental Procedures” is not the only difference between the two generations of BRET. In particular, the quantum yield of theRluc/DeepBlueC coelenterazine couple is lower than that ofRluc/coelenterazine H, and the extent of overlap between the emission spectra of Rluc and the excitation of the GFPs is better for BRET2 than BRET1. These parameters can influence the sensitivity of the assays to detect small changes in distance between energy donors and acceptors. The notion that certain BRET configurations but not others allow the detection of conformational changes induced by ligands is also well exemplified by the recent observation that agonist and antagonist binding increased the BRET between the melatonin MTR1-Rluc and MTR2-GFP but not between MTR2-Rluc and MTR1-GFP (11Ayoub M.A. Couturier C. Lucas-Meunier E. Angers S. Fossier P. Bouvier M. Jockers R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21522-21528Google Scholar). Although the curves generated concur with the theoretical behavior predicted above, quantitative analysis is complicated by the lack of direct information provided by the fluorescence and luminescence measurements on the precise concentration of receptor molecules expressed. In the absence of such information, determining the relative affinity of the protomers for each other, based on these saturation isotherms, would require that the correlations between light emission and the number of receptor-GFP and -Rluc fusion molecules are linear and identical for the two receptors considered. To directly test this supposition, cells were transfected with increasing concentrations of receptor-GFP and -Rluc constructs. For each DNA concentrations, the total expression level of the receptors was determined using the lipophilic ligand [125I]CYP, whereas the total luminescence and total fluorescence emitted by theRluc and GFP fusion proteins were measured following addition of the Rluc substrate coelenterazine H and direct excitation of the GFP at 400 nm, respectively. Fig.2 illustrates the correlation obtained between the number of total binding sites and either the luminescence or fluorescence emitted by each of the receptor fusion molecules. Even though the regression curves were highly linear, their slopes were different for the two receptors considered. Indeed, the GFP andRluc signals increased more rapidly with receptor number for the β1 than the β2AR. Although the exact cause for this difference remains unknown, this obviously complicates the analysis of the data, because this difference must be taken into account to assess the relative affinity of the receptors for each other in BRET saturation curves. The linear regression equations derived from Fig. 2 were thus used to transform the luminescence and fluorescence value in receptor number. Although the BRET saturation curves were carried out using a fixed concentration of the Rluc fusion partners, co-transfecting an increasing quantity of the GFP constructs introduces some levels of variability in the amount of receptor-Rluc expressed in each case. To rule out the influence of this variable, the BRET levels were plotted as a function of the ratio between the receptor-GFP/receptor-Rluc numbers. As shown in Fig. 3, the BRET saturation curves generated following these corrections also behaved as hyperbolic functions reaching a saturation level. The aspect of these curves greatly contrasts with that of the curve predicted if the observed BRET resulted from random collisions promoted by a high receptor density. Indeed, a quasi-linear curve would be expected if such “bystander” BRET was taking place (23Kenworthy A.K. Edidin M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 69-84Google Scholar, 24Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Google Scholar). The schematic illustration of the predicted distribution of the energy donor and acceptor in the case of dimerization versus random collision, presented in Fig.3 C, allows for an intuitive appreciation of the difference between the two situations. To allow a more quantitative comparison, the progression of bystander BRET as a function of increasing concentration of the receptor-GFP in a given surface was modeled for the β2AR homodimer. For this purpose, the receptor surface density was estimated by microscopic measurements of the HEK-293T cell surface (240 μm2) and determining the receptor number using the equations in Fig. 2. The average receptor-Rluc surface density in our BRET saturation experiments was found to be 3000 receptors/μm2. Fig.3 D shows simulations of bystander BRET carried out for receptor-Rluc levels of 30, 300, and 3000 receptors/μm2. This was accomplished using a Monte-Carlo approach that assumes a random and uniform distribution of the receptors on the calculated surface. Considering that the diameter of GPCR has been estimated to be ∼50 Å, assuming that, in the case of bystander BRET, receptor molecules would not be intertwined, and given that the R o (the distance at which the energy transfer reaches 50% of its maximum) is ∼50 Å, we estimated the BRET permissive surface as π·50 Å2. As shown in Fig.3 D, the predicted bystander BRET curves differed significantly from the BRET saturation curve obtained experimentally. Indeed, they progressed quasi-linearly up to receptor-GFP surface density for which experimental BRET values have already reached saturation. It should be noted that the difference between the experimental BRET saturation curve and the bystander BRET modeled for a receptor surface density of 3000/μm2 is most likely being underestimated, because the surface measurements did not account for plasma membrane details such as microvilli that would contribute to increased cell surface area. Moreover, the number of calculated receptors reflects the total cellular receptor content and not only those present at the cell surface. The aspect of the experimental BRET saturation curve thus suggests a clustering of the energy donor and acceptor molecules resulting form receptor oligomerization rather than from their random collisions.

A novel 14.5-kDa antimicrobial ribonuclease, termed RNase 7, was isolated from skin-derived stratum corneum. RNase 7 exhibited potent ribonuclease activity and thus may contribute to the well known ribonuclease activity of human skin. RNase 7 revealed broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against many pathogenic microorganisms and remarkably potent activity (lethal dose of 90% < 30 nm) against a vancomycin-resistant <i>Enterococcus faecium</i>. Molecular cloning from skin-derived primary keratinocytes and purification of RNase 7 from supernatants of cultured primary keratinocytes indicate that keratinocytes represent the major cellular source in skin and that RNase 7 is secreted. RNase 7 mRNA expression was detected in various epithelial tissues including skin, respiratory tract, genitourinary tract, and at a low level, in the gut. In addition to a constitutive expression, RNase 7 mRNA was induced in cultured primary keratinocytes by interleukin-1β, interferon-γ, and bacterial challenge. This is the first report demonstrating RNases as a novel class of epithelial inducible antimicrobial proteins, which may play an important role in the innate immune defense system of human epithelia."

The diversity of PG-Gs and PG-EAs that can be formed enzymatically following COX-2 oxygenation of endocannabinoids was examined in cellular and subcellular systems. In cellular systems, glycerol esters and ethanolamides of PGE2, PGD2, and PGF2α were major products of the endocannabinoid-derived COX-2 products, PGH2-G and PGH2-EA. The sequential action of purified COX-2 and thromboxane synthase on AEA and 2-AG provided thromboxane A2 ethanolamide and glycerol ester, respectively. Similarly, bovine prostacyclin synthase catalyzed the isomerization of the intermediate endoperoxides, PGH2-G and PGH2-EA, to the corresponding prostacyclin derivatives. Quantification of the efficiency of prostaglandin and thromboxane synthase-directed endoperoxide isomerization demonstrated that PGE, PGD, and PGI synthases catalyze the isomerization of PGH2-G at rates approaching those observed with PGH2. In contrast, thromboxane synthase was far more efficient at catalyzing PGH2 isomerization than at catalyzing the isomerization of PGH2-G. These results define the in vitrodiversity of endocannabinoid-derived prostanoids and will permit focused investigations into their production and potential biological actions in vivo.

The endocannabinoids, 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) and anandamide (AEA), are also liberated from the cell membrane by phospholipases in a stimulus-induced manner (9Sugiura T. Kobayashi Y. Oka S. Waku K. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 2002; 66: 173-192Google Scholar). In addition, COX-2 has been shown to catalyze their oxygenation to provide PGH2 glycerol ester (PGH2-G) and PGH2-ethanolamide (PGH2-EA) (10Kozak K.R. Rowlinson S.W. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33744-33749Google Scholar, 11Yu M. Ives D. Ramesha C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21181-21186Google Scholar). Endogenous cellular stores of 2-AG have been shown to support PGH2-G biosynthesis in a stimulus-induced manner (10Kozak K.R. Rowlinson S.W. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33744-33749Google Scholar). Additionally, PGH2-G has been shown to be a substrate for PGD synthase (PGDS), raising the possibility that the class of glyceryl PGs is as diverse as the well-known arachidonic acid-derived metabolites (10Kozak K.R. Rowlinson S.W. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33744-33749Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to identify metabolizing reactions downstream of COX-2-mediated, endocannabinoid oxygenation and define the diversity of the novel lipid products. A series of cellular and enzymatic assays was developed to examine the capacities of several PG synthases to metabolize PGH2-G and PGH2-EA. To begin to define the potential biological significance of endocannabinoid-derived prostanoid generation, efforts were also directed at characterizing the relative efficiency of endoperoxide isomerization by PGE, PGD, TXA, and PGI synthases. Our results clarify the in vitro diversity of endocannabinoid-derived PG-Gs and PG-EAs and suggest that D-, E-, and I-series prostanoids are potentially significant downstream products of endocannabinoid oxygenation by COX-2.

Enzymatically active, human, recombinant, microsomal PGE synthase (PGES), containing a hexahistidine tag, was purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography. This procedure will be published in detail elsewhere. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). Rat plasma was obtained by abdominal aortic puncture and stored at −80 °C until used. Low passage number murine RAW 264.7 cells were grown to 30–50% confluence and activated with IFN-γ (10 units/ml) and LPS (1 μg/ml) in serum-free DMEM for 7.5 h at 37 °C. Following stimulation, medium was aspirated and replaced with fresh phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were treated with Me2SO vehicle, indomethacin (3 μm), or indomethacin phenethylamide (3 μm) for 20 min at 37 °C followed by the addition of AEA (20 μm). After 30 min, phosphate-buffered saline was removed and extracted twice with an equal volume of CHCl3:MeOH (2:1). The solvent was evaporated, and the residue was dissolved in H2O:MeCN (1:1) and subjected to liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis. Exogenous AEA metabolism by RAW 264.7 cells was evaluated in three independent experiments, and a representative result is displayed. HCA-7 cells were grown to near confluence (>80%) in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Medium was aspirated and replaced with fresh Hanks' balanced salt solution.

HCA-7 cell metabolism of each endocannabinoid was evaluated in three independent experiments, and representative results are displayed. PGH2 and PGH2-G isomerization by human, hematopoietic PGDS was quantitatively assessed by treating 50 μl of buffer (100 mm Tris, 500 μm phenol, 2 mm reduced glutathione, pH 8.0) containing 885 nm mCOX-2 and 19 nm PGDS with the indicated concentration of 2-AG or arachidonic acid. Following incubation at room temperature, reactions were quenched by the addition of 150 μl of ice-cold MeOH. Quenched reaction mixtures were vigorously vortexed and placed on ice. The mixtures were then centrifuged (14,000 rpm, 10 min), and 150-μl aliquots of the supernatants were transferred to clean microcentrifuge tubes. MeOH and water were removed in vacuo, and residues were taken up in 25 μl of Me2SO and vigorously vortexed. Fresh, frozen rat plasma was then added to effect ester hydrolysis (final volume of 300 μl) as previously described (17Kozak K.R. Crews B.C. Ray J.L. Tai H.H. Morrow J.D. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36993-36998Google Scholar). Plasma-treated samples were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. PGD2 quantification was conducted by gas chromatography/negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry (GC/NCI MS) as described previously (18Coffey R.J. Hawkey C.J. Damstrup L. Graves-Deal R.

The assay conditions were developed using a standard TLC assay and 20 μm [1-14C]arachidonic acid with an initial incubation time of 5 min (19Kalgutkar A.S. Kozak K.R. Crews B.C. Hochgesang Jr., G.P. Marnett L.J. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 4800-4818Google Scholar). Essentially complete consumption of [1-14C]arachidonic acid was observed with 885 nm mCOX-2. Using 19 nm PGDS, [1-14C]PGD2 represented less than 50% of the total products. PGH2 and PGH2-G isomerization by human, microsomal PGES was quantitatively assessed by treating 100 μl of buffer (100 mm Tris, 500 μm phenol, 2.5 mm reduced glutathione, pH 8.0) containing 885 nm mCOX-2 and 140 nm PGES with the indicated concentration of 2-AG or arachidonic acid. Following incubation at room temperature, reactions were quenched by the addition of an equal volume of 4 n NaOH and incubated for 90 min at 37 °C to effect ester hydrolysis and degradation to PGB2.

Using 140 nm PGES, [1-14C]PGB2 represented less than 50% of the total products. TXAS metabolism of [1-14C]PGH2, PGH2-G, and PGH2-EA was assessed by incubating [1-14C]arachidonic acid (5 μm), 2-AG (5 μm), or AEA (25 μm) with hCOX-2 in the presence or absence of hTXAS in 200 μl of 100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) containing 100 μm phenol and 0.05% Lubrol. For 2-AG and [1-14C]arachidonic acid reactions, 10 nm hCOX-2 and 50 nm hTXAS were employed. For AEA reactions, 20 nm hCOX-2 and 50 or 150 nm hTXAS were used. Following a 5-min room temperature incubation, reactions were terminated by the addition of 300 μl of either ice-cold EtOAc (2-AG and AEA) or ice-cold Et2O:MeOH:1 m citric acid (30:4:1) containing 10 mg/ml triphenylphosphine ([1-14C]arachidonic acid). For 2-AG and AEA analyses, the organic solvent was separated and evaporated under a stream of argon. The resultant residue was dissolved in MeCN:H2O (1:1) and subjected to LC/MS analysis. For [1-14C]arachidonic acid analysis, products were analyzed by TLC as previously described (19Kalgutkar A.S. Kozak K.R. Crews B.C. Hochgesang Jr., G.P. Marnett L.J. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 4800-4818Google Scholar). Under these conditions, ∼50% of [1-14C]arachidonic acid was consumed and essentially complete conversion of [1-14C]PGH2 to [1-14C]thromboxane B2 (TxB2) or [1-14C]hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid (HHT) was observed. TXAS metabolism of PGH2-G and PGH2-EA was evaluated in three separate experiments, and representative results are displayed. PGH2 and PGH2-G isomerization by TXAS was quantitatively assessed by treating 100 μl of buffer (100 mm Tris, 100 μm phenol, 0.05% Lubrol, pH 8.0) containing 885 nm mCOX-2 and 12.5 nm hTXAS with the indicated concentration of 2-AG or arachidonic acid. Following incubation at room temperature, reactions were quenched by the addition of an equal volume of 4 n NaOH and incubated for 90 min at 37 °C to effect ester hydrolysis. Reaction mixtures were then neutralized with 4 n HCl and rapidly frozen (−80 °C). TxB2 quantification was conducted by GC/NCI MS as described previously (18Coffey R.J. Hawkey C.J. Damstrup L.

The assay conditions were developed using a standard TLC assay and 20 μm [1-14C]arachidonic acid with an initial incubation time of 5 min (19Kalgutkar A.S. Kozak K.R. Crews B.C. Hochgesang Jr., G.P.

Using 12.5 nm TXAS, [1-14C]TxB2 and [1-14C]HHT represented less than 50% of the total products. PGIS was prepared from bovine aorta essentially as described (20DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3285-3293Google Scholar). Frozen aorta was chopped into small pieces (∼1 cm3) and placed in liquid nitrogen. The frozen pieces were homogenized in 4 volumes of 100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.2) containing 100 μmflurbiprofen with a Kinematica AG Polytron homogenizer at 4 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged twice at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resultant supernatant was centrifuged again at 150,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C to collect the microsomal pellet. Microsomes from 10–20 g of tissue were resuspended in 1 ml of 100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.2) containing 100 μm flurbiprofen. To assay PGIS activity, resuspended microsomes were placed in 100 μl of 100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) containing 100 μmflurbiprofen. To this solution was added [1-14C]PGH2, PGH2-G, or PGH2-EA in 100 μl of 100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) containing 500 μm phenol. Reactions were allowed to proceed at room temperature for 5 min prior to termination with 300 μl of ice-cold EtOAc. In reactions with [1-14C]PGH2, 6 μl of 1 n HCl was added after termination to acidify the aqueous layer and improve product extraction. For [1-14C]arachidonic acid analysis, products were analyzed by TLC as previously described using an eluant of EtOAc:2,2,4-trimethylpentane:HOAc:H2O (110:50:20:100, v/v, upper phase) (21Salmon J.A. Flower R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 86: 477-493Google Scholar). For 2-AG and AEA analyses, the organic solvent was separated and evaporated under a stream of argon. The resultant residue was dissolved in MeCN:H2O (1:1) and subjected to LC/MS analysis. Under these conditions, 10 μl of the microsomal suspension (58 μg of protein) was sufficient to catalyze essentially complete conversion of [1-14C]PGH2 to [1-14C]6-keto-PGF1α, the stable hydrolysis product of [1-14C]prostacyclin. Consequently, 10 μl of the microsomal suspension were used in the qualitative assays conducted with PGH2-G and PGH2-EA. To heat-inactivate PGIS, samples were maintained at 90 °C for 1 h. [1-14C]PGH2 and PGH2-G were prepared by incubating [1-14C]arachidonic acid (20 μm) or 2-AG (20 μm) with hematin-reconstituted, wild-type mCOX-2 (885 nm) for 1 min at room temperature in 100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) containing 500 μm phenol. PGH2-EA was prepared by incubating AEA (40 μm) with hematin-reconstituted, wild-type mCOX-2 (1.7 μm) for 1 min at room temperature in 100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) containing 500 μmphenol. Under these conditions, complete consumption of [1-14C]arachidonic acid was observed. Indomethacin inactivation of mCOX-2 was accomplished with a 20-min, room temperature preincubation of enzyme with inhibitor (10 μm). PGIS metabolism of PGH2-G and PGH2-EA was evaluated in three separate experiments, and representative results are displayed. PGH2 and PGH2-G isomerization by PGIS was quantitatively assessed by treating 100 μl of buffer (100 mm Tris, 500 μm phenol, pH 8.0) containing 885 nm mCOX-2 with the indicated concentration of 2-AG or arachidonic acid. Following incubation at room temperature for 1 min, reactions were treated with 14.5 μg of the PGIS microsomal protein suspension. Following incubation at room temperature for the indicated time, reactions were quenched by the addition of an equal volume of 4n NaOH and incubated for 90 min at 37 °C to effect ester hydrolysis. Reaction mixtures were then neutralized with 4n HCl and rapidly frozen (−80 °C). 6-Keto-PGF1α quantification was conducted by GC/NCI MS as described previously (18Coffey R.J. Hawkey C.J. Damstrup L. Graves-Deal R. Daniel V.C. Dempsey P.J. Chinery R. Kirkland S.C. DuBois R.N. Jetton T.L. Morrow J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 657-662Google Scholar). The assay conditions were developed using a standard TLC assay and 20 μm[1-14C]arachidonic acid (21Salmon J.A. Flower R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 86: 477-493Google Scholar). Essentially complete consumption of [1-14C]arachidonic acid was observed with 885 nm mCOX-2. Using 14.5 μg of microsomal protein, [1-14C]6-keto-PGF1α represented less than 50% of the total products. LC/MS was conducted with a Waters 2690 Separations Module and a Zorbax RX-C18 narrow bore column (15 cm × 2.1 mm, 5 μm) interfaced to a Finnigan TSQ-7000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer as previously described (10Kozak K.R. Rowlinson S.W. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33744-33749Google Scholar). Sodiated analytes were eluted with increasing concentrations of acetonitrile in 0.001% aqueous sodium acetate and detected as positive ions. The presence of sodium in analytes was confirmed by detecting a fragment of 23 atomic mass units following collision-induced dissociation. PGD synthase catalyzes the isomerization of 2-AG-derived PGH2-G to PGD2-G (10Kozak K.R. Rowlinson S.W. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33744-33749Google Scholar). To determine if this enzyme can catalyze the analogous reaction with AEA-derived PGH2-EA, LPS/IFN-γ-activated RAW 264.7 cells were treated with exogenous AEA and the PG-EA products were analyzed by LC/MS. Only one PG-EA product was observed in the medium of AEA-treated, activated RAW 264.7 macrophages. This PG-EA product coeluted with the minor PG-EA product with m/z 418 produced by COX-2 oxygenation of AEA as well as with synthetic PGD2-EA (Fig.1). PGD2-EA was not detected in the medium of unactivated macrophages or LPS/IFN-γ-activated macrophages that were not treated with AEA (data not shown). Finally, PGD2-EA synthesis was inhibited by indomethacin and the selective COX-2 inhibitor, indomethacin phenethylamide (Fig. 1). Thus, cellular PGD synthase can direct the isomerization of PGH2-EA. The absence of the nonenzymatic, PGH2-EA isomerization product, PGE2-EA, further suggests that PGD synthase efficiently catalyzes this reaction. To address, quantitatively, the capacity of PGDS to metabolize endocannabinoid-derived endoperoxides, a coupled assay was developed to compare the rates of PGH2 and PGH2-G isomerization by human, hematopoietic PGDS. Reaction mixtures containing both COX-2 and PGDS were treated with either arachidonic acid or 2-AG at concentrations ranging from 0 to 20 μm. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 0–5 min. To obtain a common chemical moiety for mass spectrometric analysis, namely the free acid PGD2, reaction products were treated with rat plasma, which contains a very active glycerol ester hydrolase (17Kozak K.R. Crews B.C. Ray J.L. Tai H.H. Morrow J.D. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36993-36998Google Scholar). PGDS catalyzed the isomerization of both PGH2 and PGH2-G to D-series prostanoids in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (Fig.2). At all time points and concentrations, PGD2 formation from arachidonic acid was ∼2-fold greater than that observed when 2-AG was used as substrate in this coupled assay. To determine if endocannabinoid-derived, PGH2-like lipids can be metabolized into PG-Gs and PG-EAs of the E- and F-series, a cell-based enzymatic assay was employed. The human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, HCA-7, is known to express COX-2 constitutively (18Coffey R.J. Hawkey C.J. Damstrup L. Graves-Deal R. Daniel V.C. Dempsey P.J. Chinery R. Kirkland S.C. DuBois R.N. Jetton T.L. Morrow J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 657-662Google Scholar). In addition, the primary prostaglandins produced by arachidonic acid-treated HCA-7 cells are PGE2 and PGF2α (18Coffey R.J. Hawkey C.J. Damstrup L. Graves-Deal R. Daniel V.C. Dempsey P.J. Chinery R. Kirkland S.C. DuBois R.N. Jetton T.L. Morrow J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 657-662Google Scholar). Treatment of HCA-7 cells with 2-AG or AEA resulted in the appearance of PG-Gs or PG-EAs in the cell medium. Cells treated with 2-AG produced a PG-G with m/z 449 that coeluted with synthetic PGE2-G (Fig.3 A). HCA-7 cell production of PGE2-G was inhibited by indomethacin and indomethacin phenethylamide and, under the conditions employed, required exogenous 2-AG (Fig. 3 A and data not shown). Similarly, 2-AG-treated HCA-7 cells produced a PG-G with m/z 451 that coeluted with synthetic PGF2α-G (Fig. 3 B). HCA-7 cell production of PGF2α-G was inhibited by indomethacin and indomethacin phenethylamide and, under the conditions employed, required exogenous 2-AG (Fig. 3 B and data not shown). AEA treatment of HCA-7 cells resulted in the appearance of PG-EA products in the medium. As expected, PGE2-EA and PGF2α-EA were detected in selected ion mass chromatograms at m/z 418 and 420, respectively (Fig.3 C). A relatively small amount of PGD2-EA was also observed (Fig. 3 C). Formation of these products required exogenous AEA and could be inhibited by nonselective COX or selective COX-2 inhibitors (data not shown). Confirmation of the identity of the PG-EA products was achieved by coelution with synthetically and enzymatically generated standards. In addition to PGE2-EA, a prominent, less polar, indomethacin-sensitive product appeared with m/z 418 (Fig.3 C, top panel). We hypothesized that this product may represent a metabolite of PGE2-EA with an identical mass. To test this hypothesis, tetradeuterated 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGE2-EA was synthesized by coupling the free acid to d4-ethanolamine. As suspected, the synthetic standard coeluted with the unknown m/z418 species, identifying it as 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGE2-EA (Fig. 3 C,lower panel). Thus, HCA-7 cells appear to express active 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-HPGDH) and Δ13-15-keto-prostaglandin reductase. The significant conversion of PGE2-EA to 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGE2-EA contrasts with little observed conversion of PGF2α-EA to less polar metabolites of the same mass (Fig. 3 C). This observation is consistent with previous reports that PGE2 is a much better substrate than PGF2α for 15-HPGDH (22Kung-Chao D.T. Tai H.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 614: 1-13Google Scholar, 23Ensor C.M. Tai H.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1208: 151-156Google Scholar, 24Ohno H. Morikawa Y. Hirata F. J.

To address, quantitatively, the capacity of PGES to metabolize endocannabinoid-derived endoperoxides, a coupled assay, similar to the one described above for PGDS, was developed to compare the rates of PGH2 and PGH2-G isomerization by human, microsomal PGES. Reaction mixtures containing both COX-2 and PGES were treated with either arachidonic acid or 2-AG at concentrations ranging from 0 to 20 μm and incubated at room temperature for 0–5 min. PGE2 and PGE2-G were then converted to the free acid, PGB2, by treatment with sodium hydroxide thus permitting mass spectrometric analysis of a single, common product. PGES catalyzed the isomerization of both PGH2 and PGH2-G to E-series prostanoids as evidenced by the time- and concentration-dependent production of PGB2in this assay (Fig. 4). At all time points and concentrations, the sequential actions of COX-2, PGES, and sodium hydroxide on 2-AG provided slightly lower levels of PGB2 than those observed when arachidonic acid was used as substrate (60–75%). TXAS catalyzes the isomerization of PGH2 to thromboxane A2(TxA2) and concurrently directs the scission of PGH2 into HHT and malondialdehyde. TxA2 and HHT are formed in roughly equal amounts by TXAS (26Haurand M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15059-15067Google Scholar). In aqueous solutions, TxA2 is rapidly hydrolyzed to thromboxane B2(TxB2) (t ½ ∼ 30 s) (27Hamberg M. Svensson J. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2994-2998Google Scholar). To determine if TXAS can catalyze the isomerization of endocannabinoid derived PGH2-like lipids to the corresponding thromboxanes, solutions containing recombinant human COX-2 were treated with 2-AG or AEA in the presence or absence of recombinant TXAS. PGH2-G spontaneously isomerizes to, primarily, PGE2- and PGD2-G (Fig. 5,m/z 449, top panel). Inclusion of TXAS in these reactions led to a reduction in PGE2- and PGD2-G formation suggesting that TXAS metabolizes PGH2-G (Fig. 5, m/z 449, bottom panel). In addition, inclusion of TXAS in incubations led to the concurrent generation of new products with masses corresponding to HHT-G (Fig. 5, m/z 377) and TxB2-G (Fig. 5, m/z 467). The identification of HHT-G was accomplished by coelution of the TXAS-generated product withm/z 377 with authentic HHT-G formed as a minor side product in COX-2 oxygenations of 2-AG. Identification of TxB2-G was accomplished by coelution, under multiple conditions, of the TXAS-generated product withm/z 467 with d5-Tx"

Because the polymorphism is absent from the mature protein, we hypothesized that its biological effect must involve early stages of protein processing, prior to signal peptide cleavage. Constructs representing the two alleles were compared byin vitro translation, in the presence of endoplasmic reticulum membranes. We studied glycosylation by endoglycosidase H digestion and glycosylation mutant constructs, cleavage of peptide with inhibitors, and membrane integration by ultracentrifugation and proteinase K sensitivity. A major cleaved and glycosylated product was seen for both alleles of the protein but a band representing incomplete glycosylation was markedly more abundant in the predisposing Ala allele (32.7 ± 1.0 versus 10.6% ± 1.2 for Thr,p < 10−9). In addition, differential intracellular/surface partitioning was studied with co-transfection of the alleles fused to distinct fluorescent proteins in COS-1 cells. By quantitative confocal microscopy we found a higher ratio of cell surface/total CTLAThr17 versusCTLAAla17 (p = 0.01). Our findings corroborate observations, in other proteins, that the signal peptide can determine the efficiency of post-translational modifications other than cleavage and suggest inefficient processing of the autoimmunity predisposing Ala allele as the explanation for the genetic effect.

Because the signal peptide is co-translationally cleaved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is not a part of the mature protein, we hypothesized that the T17A polymorphism determines differential targeting to the cell surface by altering early intracellular trafficking of CTLA-4. Signal peptides function in directing ribosome-bound nascent polypeptides to the (ER) membrane where they assure the translocation of growing polypeptide chains into the ER lumen. In conformity with most signal sequences, the CTLA-4 signal peptide has three distinct regions (Fig.1): a predicted hydrophobic sequence of 12 amino acids flanked by two helix-breaking prolines, a small polar COOH terminus (C-) region encompassing the recognition site for signal peptide cleavage, and a long NH2 terminus (N-) region of 20 amino acids that includes the Thr to Ala substitution at position 17. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the Ala allele introduces a hydrophobic amino acid in a highly conserved position, occupied by a serine or threonine in 24 of 25 other species found in a BLAST search we performed (four species are shown for illustration purposes in Fig.1 A). This change somewhat alters hydrophobicity and α-helix propensity, two properties known to be important in signal peptide function (Fig. 1 B). Because Ala homozygotes are very frequent in the general population, the functional consequences of this substitution must be subtle, as expected of common alleles predisposing to complex disorders. These allelic effects may involve differential binding to the signal recognition particle, anchoring of the signal peptide to the ER membrane, entry of the growing polypeptide into the lumen, signal peptide cleavage, and possibly, association with chaperones and other quality control elements of the ER lumen that might affect folding and glycosylation (42Li Y. Bergeron J.J. Luo L. Ou W.J. Thomas D.Y. Kang C.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9606-9611Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The work reported here was aimed at testing the hypothesis that the T17A substitution in the signal peptide of CTLA-4 alters the early ER trafficking and/or processing of CTLA-4 and leads to its differential expression on the cell surface. To test our hypothesis we used a cell-free in vitro translation system suited for examining early ER transport events. To also look for decreased expression at the cell surface, the hypothesized ultimate consequence of defective early processing, we examined allelic differences in intracellular versus cell surface CTLA-4 levels in a dual-transfection system with fusion of each allele to a different fluorescent protein and simultaneous quantification by confocal microscopy. The results suggest defective ER processing of a significant portion of the CTLAAla17 molecules resulting in an aberrantly glycosylated product and decreased cell surface expression. Full-length CTLA-4 was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR from cDNA of a heterozygous individual for the signal peptide polymorphism at codon 17. For the fluorescent fusion proteins, a forward primer containing the linkerNheI (underlined), ATAGCTAGCATGGCTTGCCTTTGGATTTCAG, and an antisense primer containing the linker AgeI (underlined), with two additional bases (lowercase) CACACCGGTgcATTGATGGGAATAAAATAAGGC, ensured an in-frame, seamless fusion protein. PCR was performed with a high fidelity polymerase/Taq mixture. Adenine 3′ overhangs were added and the PCR product was cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Clone genotyping was done by PCR and digestion withFnu4HI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Full-length CTLAThr17 and CTLAAla17 digested withNheI + AgeI purified from plasmid were fused to restricted NheI + AgeI ECFP and EYFP (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). For in vitro transcription, full-length CTLA-4 with the termination codon was amplified from plasmid with the mutagenic antisense primer CACACCGGTtcaATTGATGGGAATAAAATAAGGC (the stop codon is in lowercase and the AgeI linker is underlined). Adenine 3′ overhangs were added to the PCR product and ligated to pCR2.1 T-vector and clones were selected for orientation downstream of the T7 promoter. Truncation of amino acids Tyr201-Asn223 from the CTLA-4 COOH-terminal results in a mutant constitutively directed to the cell surface with no requirement for the machinery that normally directs this translocation in activated T-cells (43Leung H.T. Bradshaw J. Cleaveland J.S. Linsley P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25107-25114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The corresponding construct was prepared by PCR amplification from cDNA of a heterozygous individual using the antisense primer ATAACCGGTgaCCCCTGTTGTAAGAGGGCTTC (AgeI underlined) and T/A was cloned into pCR2.1. COOH-truncated CTLAThr17 and CTLAAla17 will be denoted herein as CTLAGlyThr17 and CTLAGlyAla17 in reference to Gly200, the last amino acid in the truncated constructs (numbering of all constructs assumes an uncleaved signal peptide of 37 amino acids). The truncated DNA plasmids were then subcloned in-frame into ECFP and EYFP plasmids, using theNheI + AgeI sites. All resulting DNA constructs were sequenced. The two predictedN-linked glycosylation sites in the CTLA-4 sequence were deleted by site-directed mutagenesis by the mismatched primer method (44Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4894) Google Scholar) using the QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Asparagine 113 and asparagine 145 were converted to aspartate residues in CTLAAla17 and CTLAThr17. Both sites were mutated in each allele yielding CTLAAla-17(N113D/D145A) and CTLAThr-17(N113D/N145D) or one at a time, yielding CTLAAla-17(N113D), CTLAAla17(N113D), and CTLAThr-17(N145D), and CTLAAla-17(N145D). All mutant constructs were verified by sequencing. COS-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin, at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Transient transfections were carried out using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 6-well plates on glass coverslips according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were processed 24–48 h after transfection. Full-length cDNA encoding CTLAAla17and CTLAThr17 (or their glycosylation mutants) in pCR2.1 was linearized by SpeI and in vitro transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). The resulting mRNA was standardized to 1 mg/ml and equal amounts were added to a premixed mixture containing rabbit reticulocyte lysate with [35S]methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences), in the presence or absence of canine pancreatic microsomal membranes according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Translation products were denatured by boiling in 2× SDS loading buffer and 10–15-μl aliquots were run on 15% SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography at −70 °C. Endoglycosidase H (EndoH) (New England Biolabs) digestions were performed on in vitro translated protein. Briefly, proteins were treated with 75 mmdithiothreitol and 10% SDS and boiled for 5 min. The resulting supernatant was incubated with EndoH, for the indicated times at 37 °C. Products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography as described above. To distinguish in vitrotranslated CTLA-4 molecules integrated in the ER membrane from those in the cytosolic phase, we used proteinase K digestion. Translation products were treated with 100 mm CaCl2, and incubated for 1 h with 20 μg/ml proteinase K (Sigma) with or without Triton X-100 (1%) at 0 °C. The reaction was terminated with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 mm final concentration). As an additional measure of cytosolic/ER partition the translation products were separated by ultracentrifugation. Briefly, reactions were diluted 100-fold with Na2CO3 (pH 11.5), and centrifuged at 100,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 1× SDS sample buffer and denatured by boiling for 3–4 min. The supernatant was concentrated by column filtration (Microcon, Bedford, MA) to 1/10 of its original volume. The sample was prepared for SDS-PAGE by denaturation in 2× SDS sample buffer. All products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Finally, inhibition of the signal peptidase was achieved by incubation of the translation mixture with 5 mm (final concentration)N-methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-chloromethyl ketone (Sigma) in 10% Me2SO for 1 h at 30 °C. Transfected cells were washed 3 times in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with ice-cold 50:50 acetone/methanol for 3 min or fixed with freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. The fixed cells were mounted on standard microscope slides with conventional mounting media. Samples were analyzed by confocal microscopy (LSM 510, Zeiss Axiophot, Germany). Simultaneous double acquisitions were performed using the 458- and 514-nm laser lines to excite cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), respectively, using ×63 oil immersion Neofluar objectives. The fluorescence was selected with double fluorescence dichroic mirror and a band pass filter of 480–520 nm for CFP and a long pass filter of 560 nm for YFP. The images were processed and analyzed using NIH Image freeware available from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) website (rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/Default.html). An outline of the cell surface was drawn with the cursor and the mean density was calculated for each color acquisition simultaneously. The same was done for the intracellular fluorescence (both procedures are illustrated in Fig.7 C). For densitometry measurements taken from autoradiographs, background density was subtracted from each band and the same area was selected for all measurements within one experiment. When otherwise identical full-length CTLAAla17 and CTLAThr17 cDNA constructs were in vitrotranscribed and translated in the absence of microsomal membranes, [35S]methionine-labeled protein products from both allelic forms migrated with an apparent molecular weight of 26,000. This is consistent with the calculated molecular mass of monomeric, uncleaved, unglycosylated CTLA-4 (Fig.2 A, lanes 1 and4). Upon addition of microsomal membranes translation products of 29 kDa were apparent for both alleles, corresponding to the size change expected from high mannose glycosylation in two positions and signal peptide cleavage. In addition, the CTLAAla17reaction (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2 and 3) contained an intermediate band migrating with an apparent molecular weight of 25,000. In multiple experiments, this band was absent or only faintly visible in the CTLAThr17 lane. Quantitatively, the CTLAAla17 25-kDa product represented 32.7% ± 1.0 of total processed CTLAAla17 versus 10.6% ± 1.2 for the CTLAThr17 allele (Fig. 2 B) (p < 1 × 10−9, n = 11 independent experiments). This ratio was independent of the amount of microsomal membranes in the reaction, within a range from 0.8 to 2.8 eq membranes added to the reticulocyte lysate. One observation worth noting was that translation efficiency was substantially increased in the presence of microsomal membranes suggesting that co-translational CTLA-4 processing increases translation efficiency. Having established that a portion of CTLAAla17 molecules is differentially processed in the ER, we next examined the nature of this allele-specific intermediate. The 25-kDa CTLA4Ala17 fraction, close in size with the band seen in the absence of microsomes, could represent an uncleaved and unglycosylated form that has not undergone any processing in the ER. Alternatively, it could represent correctly translocated but incorrectly cleaved and/or glycosylated products. According to SignalP, a signal peptidase recognition site prediction algorithm (45Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4923) Google Scholar) (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/index.html), both alleles had the same cleavage site at Ala37-Met38 (Fig.1 A), resulting in a 37-amino acid cleaved signal peptide. Cleavage by the signal peptidase was experimentally confirmed by using a signal peptidase inhibitor (N-methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-chloromethyl ketone). For both allelic forms, inhibition of cleavage gave rise to a full-length intermediate of ∼33 kDa resulting from a gain of 4 kDa by the 29-kDa intermediate, corresponding to a gain of the 37-amino acid signal peptide (Fig. 3). Thus the major bands in the translated products of both CTLAAla17 and CTLAThr17 represent cleaved intermediates. The cleavage status of the additional CTLAAla17 25-kDa band was less clear because of band overlap (Fig. 3), as inhibition was not complete at the maximum effective concentration of inhibitor (higher concentrations inhibited translation). Thus the major bands for both alleles must represent fully glycosylated and fully cleaved product. CTLA-4, a cell surface receptor, has two predicted N-linked glycosylation sites located in the extracellular domain, at Asn113 and Asn145, thought to be important for structural integrity (46Metzler W.J. Bajorath J. Fenderson W. Shaw S.Y. Constantine K.L. Naemura J. Leytze G. Peach R.J. Lavoie T.B. Mueller L. Linsley P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Although not all instances of the consensus sequon Asn-X-Thr/Ser (X = any amino acid) are necessarily glycosylated (47Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 48Kasturi L. Eshleman J.R. Wunner W.H. Shakin-Eshleman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14756-14761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), the observed size of the major band clearly indicated full glycosylation of most of the molecules for either allele. This was further confirmed with partial digestion of thein vitro translation products with EndoH that, in glycoproteins with several glycosylation sites, produces a ladder of partially digested molecules differing by only one N-linked chain. Two additional major bands with an estimated molecular weights of 25,000 and 22,000 appeared after 1–2 h of digestion (Fig.4 A, lanes 2–5) representing cleavage of, respectively, one or two N-linked glycosylation moieties from the 29-kDa form that was still visible. Further digestion for up to 16 h never produced smaller products. The 25-kDa band was indistinguishable in size from the aberrant intermediate seen with CTLAAla17. This allowed us to conclude firmly that, in addition to being cleaved, the 29-kDa product was glycosylated at both sites and, tentatively, that the aberrant CTLAAla17 product represents cleaved, monoglycosylated protein. This was further confirmed with complete EndoH deglycosylation. As expected, prolonged digestion for 16 h with EndoH resulted in a major band of 22 kDa for both alleles, with no extra band for CTLAAla17 (Fig. 4 B). Thus complete deglycosylation abolished any difference between allelic forms of the protein, allowing us to conclude that the extra band seen after microsomal processing of nascent CTLAAla17 represents cleaved but aberrantly glycosylated CTLA-4. The deglycosylation results regarding the nature of the unprocessed intermediate observed in CTLAAla17 were further corroborated by site-specific mutagenesis designed to abrogate glycosylation by removing each glycosylation site separately and both together in each allele. Asn113 and Asn145, the predicted N-linked glycosylation sites, were replaced with Asp residues at the same positions (Fig.5). The resulting constructs werein vitro transcribed and translated, as described above. All glycosylation mutants translated in the absence of microsomal membranes behaved as the wild-type alleles and a 26-kDa translation product was detected. In the presence of ER-containing membranes, the double glycosylation mutant migrated at 22 kDa, as expected of an unglycosylated CTLA-4 with a cleaved signal peptide. No extra band correspo"

GRX-overexpressing cells demonstrated resistance to glucose deprivation-induced cytotoxicity and decreased activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK1). Deletion mutants showed the C-terminal portion of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) bound GRX, and glucose deprivation disrupted binding. Treatment withl-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine reduced glutathione content by 99% and prevented glucose deprivation-induced dissociation of GRX from ASK1. A thiol antioxidant,N-acetyl-l-cysteine, or overexpression of an H2O2 scavenger, catalase, inhibited glucose deprivation-induced dissociation of GRX from ASK1. GRX active site cysteine residues (Cys22 and Cys25) were required for dissociation of GRX from ASK1 during glucose deprivation. Kinase assays revealed that SEK1 and JNK1 were regulated in an ASK1-dependent fashion during glucose deprivation. Overexpression of GRX or catalase inhibited activation of ASK1-SEK1-JNK1 signaling during glucose deprivation. These results demonstrate that GRX is a negative regulator of ASK1 and dissociation of GRX from ASK1 activates ASK1-SEK1-JNK1 signaling leading to cytotoxicity during glucose deprivation. These results support the hypothesis that the GRX-ASK1 interaction is redox sensitive and regulated in a glutathione-dependent fashion by H2O2.

Glucose deprivation has been shown to cause metabolic oxidative stress characterized by increases in steady state levels of intracellular prooxidant production (presumably hydroperoxides) and cytotoxicity in human breast carcinoma MCF-7/ADR cells (1Lee Y.J.

Although the cellular source of prooxidant production is uncertain, recent studies (2Spitz D.R. Sim J.E. Ridnour L.A. Galoforo S.S. Lee Y.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Overexpression of the mitochondrial bcl-2 protein appeared to limit localization of prooxidant production to mitochondria and protected cells from oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity during glucose deprivation (3Lee Y.J.

These results suggested that prooxidant production seen during glucose deprivation is most likely due to the metabolism of fatty acids and amino acids via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle leading to the production of NADH and FADH2 as the source of electrons for mitochondrial electron transport chain-mediated prooxidant production during respiration (2Spitz D.R.

Recent studies have also shown that pro-apoptotic signaling originating from the mitochondria is mediated by the JNK pathway (11Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1550) Google Scholar) possibly through Bid cleavage, cytochrome c release, and/or mitochondrial membrane depolarization. However, a fundamental question, that remains unanswered, is how glucose deprivation-induced metabolic oxidative stress is sensed resulting in the activation of these signal transduction pathways. Growing evidence has indicated that cellular oxidation/reduction (redox) status regulates various aspects of cellular function including signal transduction (12Nakamura H. Nakamura K. Yodoi J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 351-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Cellular redox status is sensed and maintained in a non-equilibrium steady state by intracellular redox-regulating molecules including thioredoxin (TRX) and glutaredoxin (GRX) (12Nakamura H. Nakamura K. Yodoi J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 351-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). GRX, also known as thioltransferase, is a small (12 kDa) dithiol protein that has been shown to be involved in regulating various cellular functions, including redox regulation of certain enzyme activities (13Hirota K. Matsui M. Murata M. Takashima Y. Cheng F.S. Itoh T. Fukuda K. Yodoi J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). GRX was originally discovered in mutantEscherichia coli that lacked TRX but had a fully active NADPH-dependent ribonucleotide reductase system (14Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 15Wells W.W. Yang Y. Deits T.L. Adv. Enzymol Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1993; 66: 149-201PubMed Google Scholar, 16Padilla C. Martinez-Galisteo E. Barcena J.A. Spyrou G. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 17Powis G. Briehl M. Oblong J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 68: 149-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). GRX is reduced by glutathione, which in turn is reduced by NADPH and glutathione reductase (15Wells W.W. Yang Y. Deits T.L. Adv. Enzymol Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1993; 66: 149-201PubMed Google Scholar). Since previous studies had demonstrated that glucose deprivation-induced oxidative stress increased intracellular GSSG (1Lee Y.J. Galoforo S.S. Berns C.M. Chen J.C. Davis B.H. Sim J.E. Corry P.M. Spitz D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5294-5299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 2Spitz D.R. Sim J.E. Ridnour L.A. Galoforo S.S. Lee Y.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 899: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 6Lee Y.J. Galoforo S.S. Sim J.E. Ridnour L.A. Choi J. Forman H.J. Corry P.M. Spitz D.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 575-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), it is possible that GRX could sense changes in the redox state of GSH/GSSG and be involved in altering signal transduction pathways resulting in biological responses. Recent studies have also revealed that TRX binds directly to the N-terminal portion of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and acts as a negative regulator by inhibiting ASK1 kinase activity and cytotoxicity (9Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2092) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that GRX could act in a similar redox sensing capacity to regulate glucose deprivation-induced cytotoxicity. The current study tested the hypothesis that a glutathione-dependent glucose deprivation-induced disruption of the physical interaction between GRX, and ASK1 mediates the activation of the ASK1-MEK-SAPK signaling pathway resulting in cytotoxicity. The results indicate that glucose deprivation causes the glutathione-dependent, redox-sensitive dissociation of GRX from the C-terminal region of ASK1 leading to the activation of ASK1-SEK1-JNK1 signal transduction pathway and cell death. Furthermore, the overexpression of GRX was found to protect cells from glucose deprivation-induced cell death by inhibiting the activation of the ASK1-SEK1-JNK1 signal transduction pathway. These results demonstrate that GRX can mediate both the sensing of, as well as protection from, metabolic oxidative stress in an ASK1-SEK1-JNK1-dependent fashion during glucose deprivation. Multidrug-resistant human breast carcinoma (MCF-7/ADR) cells or human prostate adenocarcinoma (DU-145) cells were cultured in McCoys' 5A medium with 10% iron-supplemented bovine calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), respectively and 26 mm sodium bicarbonate for monolayer cell culture. The cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and air at 37 °C. Cells were rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then exposed to glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cells were treated withl-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO) obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. by aspirating the medium and replacing it with medium containing the drug. Cells were washed with ice cold PBS, scraped into cold PBS, and centrifuged at 4 °C for 5 min at 400 × g to obtain cell pellets, which were frozen at −80 °C. Pellets were then thawed and homogenized in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8 containing 1.34 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid. Total glutathione content was determined by the method of Anderson (18Anderson M.E. Greenwald R.A. Handbook of methods for oxygen radical research. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1985: 317-323Google Scholar). Reduced and oxidized glutathione were distinguished by addition of 2 μl of a 1:1 mixture of 2-vinylpyridine and ethanol per 30 μl of sample followed by incubation for 1.5 h and assay as previously described by Griffith (19Griffith O.W. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar). All biochemical determinations were normalized to protein content using the method of Lowry et al. (20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For survival determination, cells were trypsinized, counted, and plated at appropriate dilutions. After 1–2 weeks of incubation at 37 °C, colonies were stained and counted. For the construction of the hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged GRX expression vector pcDNA3-HA-GRX, a 320-bp DNA fragment encoding the GRX gene was amplified from pBluescript containing the cDNA insert for human glutaredoxin (a gift from Dr. J. J. Mieyal, Case Western Reserve University) by PCR techniques. Briefly, the 5′-primer oligonucleotides (5′-TTAAGAATTCGCTCAAGAGTTTGTGAACTGC, which annealed to the 5′-end of the GRX gene and introduced anEcoRI site) and 3′-primer oligonucleotides (5′-GAGCTCTAGATTACTGCAGAGCTCCAATCTG, complementary to the 3′ terminus of the GRX gene, but inserting an XbaI site) were used as primers. The final reaction concentrations were 5′-primer, 0.2 μm; 3′-primer, 0.2 μm and 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTP, 10 ng pBluehGRX, TaqDNA polymerase, 5 units/reaction, 1× reaction buffer. PCR was performed with 33 cycles (94 °C, 1 min; 45 °C, 2 min; 72 °C for 2 min) with initial incubation at 94 °C for 1 min, and final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The resultant PCR product was digested with EcoRI and XbaI and then cloned into EcoRI/XbaI-cut pcDNA3-HA. pcDNA3-His-GRX was made by inserting EcoRI fragment from pQE-GRX into EcoRI-cut pcDNA3. For the construction of adenoviral vectors, the CRE-Lox recombination system was employed (21Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pAdlox-His-GRX was made by inserting HindIII/XbaI fragment from pcDNA3-His-GRX intoHindIII/XbaI-cut pAdlox shuttle vector (21Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing N-terminal fused form with hexahistidine (His6) tag. A-His-tagged 324-bp human TRX gene was isolated from pcDNA-His-TRX (a gift from Dr. J. Yodoi, Kyoto University, Japan) digestion with EcoRI and cloned into the EcoRI site of pAdlox shuttle vector. pcDNA3-HA-ASK1, pcDNA3-HA-ASK1ΔN (N-terminal region-truncated ASK1), pcDNA3-HA-ASK1ΔC (C-terminal region-truncated ASK1) were kindly provided by Dr. Ichijo (Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan). pAdlox-HA-ASK1 and the other types of ASK1 were made by inserting theSpeI/XbaI fragment from pcDNA3-HA-ASK1 intoXbaI-cut pAdlox. The complete shuttle vector was co-transfected into Cre8 cells with ψ5 viral genomic DNA for homologous recombination as described below. The adenovirus construct containing the transgene for human catalase was kindly provided by Dr. Beverly Davidson, Director, Gene Transfer Vector Core, University of Iowa. All other recombinant adenoviruses were constructed by employing the Cre-lox recombination system (21Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The selective cell line CRE8 has a β-actin-based expression cassette driving a Cre recombinase gene with an N-terminal nuclear localization signal stably integrated into 293 cells. Transfections were done by using Lipofectin™ Reagent (Invitrogen). 5 × 105 cells were split into a 6-well plate 1 day before transfection. For the production of recombinant adenovirus, 2 μg ofSfiI/ApaI-digested Adlox/ASK1 fragment orSfiI-digested Adlox/GRX (or TRX) fragment and 2 μg of ψ5 viral genomic DNA were cotransfected into CRE8 cells. The recombinant adenoviruses were generated by intermolecular homologous recombination between the shuttle vector and ψ5 viral DNA. A new virus has an intact packaging site and carries a recombinant gene. Plaques were harvested, analyzed, and purified. The insertion of HA-ASK1, His-GRX, or His-TRX to adenovirus was confirmed by Western blotting after infection of corresponding recombinant adenovirus into MCF-7/ADR cells. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenese kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to make point mutations. Listed below are the various primers, which were used for converting two cysteine residues (Cys22, Cys25) to serine in GRX to create one point mutant as well as double mutant: sense primer oligonucleotides (5′-CAAGCCCACCTCCCCGTACTGC-3′) and antisense primer oligonucleotides (5′-GCAGTACGGGGAGGTGGGCTTG-3′) for C22S; sense primer oligonucleotides (5′-CTGCCCGTACTCCAGGAGGG-3′) and antisense primer oligonucleotides (5′-CCCTCCTGGAGTACGGGCAG-3′) for C25S; sense primer oligonucleotides (5′-CCCACCTCCCCGTACTCCAGGAGGGC-3′) and antisense primer oligonucleotides (5′-GCCCTCCTGGAGTACGGGGAGGTGGG-3′) for C22S/C25S. The PCR reaction was prepared by adding 5 μl of 10× reaction buffer, 50 ng of dsDNA template (pAdlox-His-GRX), 125 ng of each sense primer, 125 ng of each antisense primer, 1 μl of dNTP mixture, double-distilled water to a final volume of 50 μl, and 1 μl ofPfu Turbo DNA polymerase (2.5 units/μl). PCR was performed with 12 cycles (95 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 1 min; 68 °C for 12 min) with initial incubation at 95 °C for 30 s. Following temperature cycling, the reaction was placed on ice for 2 min to cool the reaction. After PCR, 1 μl of DpnI restriction enzyme (10 units/μl) was added directly to each amplification reaction and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to digest the parental supercoiled dsDNA. The DpnI-treated dsDNA was transformed intoEpicurian coli XL1-Blue supercompetent cells. Colonies were selected and each plasmid (pAdlox-His-GRX) was digested withHindIII/XbaI. Its 400-bp fragment was subcloned into pBluescript SK(−). Each pBluescript SK(−)/His-GRX was sequenced using T7 primer to confirm mutation. Cells were transfected with 20 μg of pcDNA3-HA-GRX by using Lipofectin™ Reagent (Invitrogen). For stable transfection, cells were incubated for 48 h, and then selected with 400 μg/ml geneticin (Invitrogen) for 4 days, followed by continued growth in the presence of 200 μg/ml geneticin to obtain colonies suitable for isolation. To examine the interaction between ASK1 and GRX, adenovirus of HA-tagged ASK1 (Ad.HA-ASK1), HA-tagged ASK1ΔN (Ad.HA-ASK1ΔN), or HA-tagged ASK1ΔC (Ad.HA-ASK1ΔC) at an MOI of 10 and His-tagged GRX (Ad.His-GRX) at an MOI of 30 were co-infected into MCF-7/ADR cells in 10-cm culture plates. For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 80 μm aprotinin, 2 mm leupeptin, and the lysates were incubated with 2 μg of anti-penta-His mouse IgG1 (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) for 2 h. After the addition of protein G/A-agarose (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany), the lysates were incubated for an additional 2 h. The beads were washed three times with the lysis buffer, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and immunoblotted with rat anti-HA (clone 3F10, Roche Diagnostics) or mouse anti-penta-His (Qiagen). The proteins were detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (Amersham Biosciences). To confirm the interaction between endogenous ASK1 and GRX, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of anti-GRX (American Diagnostica Inc., Greenwich, CT) followed by immunoblotting with anti-ASK1 (Alexis Corp., Lausen, Switzerland) or anti-GRX antibody. To examine the effect of glucose deprivation on the interaction of ASK1 with GRX, Ad.HA-ASK1 and Ad.His-GRX co-infected MCF-7/ADR cells were rinsed three times with PBS and then exposed to glucose-free medium with 10% dialyzed bovine calf serum for various times. The plasmid containing GST-human JNK1 for bacterial fusion protein was constructed in pGEX-4T-1 by inserting the HindIII/XbaI fragment followed by Klenow treatment from pcDNA3-JNK1. The expression of GST-JNK1 protein was confirmed by Western blotting and purified by using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). GST-SEK1 was purified from 10 plates of 293 cells transfected with the pEBG/SEK1 (kindly provided by J. M. Kyriakis, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA), and the purification step was performed as described (22Yuasa T. Ohno S. Kehrl J.H. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22681-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). MCF-7/ADR cells were co-infected with 10 MOI of Ad.HA-ASK1 and various amounts of Ad.His-GRX (0, 30, or 300 MOI) for 24 h. After 24 h, cells were lysed in a buffer solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protein inhibitor mixture solution (Sigma Chemical Co.). Cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatants immunoprecipitated with mouse anti-HA antibody (12CA5, Roche Diagnostics) and protein A-agarose (Invitrogen). The beads were washed twice with a solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and washed once with the kinase buffer solution, and then they were subjected to kinase assays. To measure immune complex activity, 0.2 μg of GST-SEK1 is first incubated with the immune complexes for 10 min at 30 °C in a final volume of 25 μl of a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mm MgCl2, and 100 μm ATP, and subsequently with 1 μg of GST-JNK1 for 10 min at 30 °C. Thereafter, the activated complex is subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylated JNK1 is analyzed by rabbit anti-ACTIVE JNK antibody (Promega, Madison, WI). To determine the amount of ASK1 protein in the same sample, the upper part of the SDS-PAGE (>116 kDa) was cut out and immunoblotted with the rat anti-HA (Roche Diagnostics, rat IgG1) antibody. Cell lysates were subjected to electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS under reducing conditions, and the proteins in the gels were transferred onto a polyvinylidine difluoride (PVDF) membrane. The membranes were incubated with 7% (w/v) skim milk in PBST (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, v/v) and then reacted with primary antibodies. Polyclonal rabbit anti-ACTIVE JNK and anti-catalase antibodies were obtained from Promega and Calbiochem (San Diego, CA), respectively. Monoclonal mouse anti-actin antibody was purchased from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). After washing three times with PBST, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG. Proteins in the membranes were then visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent (Amersham Biosciences) as recommended by the manufacturer. Since GRX is thought to protect against oxidative stress by maintaining the functional redox state of proteins in the face of oxidant insult, the effect of enforced overexpression of GRX on glucose deprivation-induced cytotoxicity was determined. MCF-7/ADR cells were stably transfected with a control plasmid (Fig. 1 A,Cont) or the pcDNA3-HA-GRX plasmid containing the HA-tagged GRX cDNA (Fig. 1 A, GRX1 andGRX2). Transfectants (Cont, GRX1, and GRX2) were exposed for 4 h to glucose-free medium and then plated for clonogenic survival (Fig. 1 B). Fig. 1 shows cells that overexpressed GRX were resistant to glucose deprivation-induced cell killing as assayed by clonogenic survival. We previously reported that glucose deprivation resulted in the activation of the SAPK signal transduction pathway, which led to increases in oxidative stress and cytotoxicity (6Lee Y.J. Galoforo S.S. Sim J.E. Ridnour L.A. Choi J. Forman H.J. Corry P.M. Spitz D.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 575-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To determine if overexpression of GRX might protect cells from glucose deprivation-induced cytotoxicity by preventing the activation of SAPK signal transduction, GRX-overexpressing MCF-7/ADR cells were exposed to glucose-free medium, and SAPK activation was determined. Western blots using an antibody specific for the activated form of JNK1 (anti-ACTIVE JNK antibody) showed glucose deprivation-induced JNK activation (Fig.2) within 5 min that was maintained for more than 2 h, in cells containing the control p"
https://openalex.org/W2085320561,"In this report we demonstrate that soluble peptides, elastin degradation products stimulate proliferation of arterial smooth muscle cells. We show that these effects are due to generation of intracellular signals transduced through the cell surface elastin receptor, which consists of peripheral 67-kDa elastin-binding protein (EBP) (spliced variant of β-galactosidase), immobilized to the transmembrane sialidase and the protective protein. We found that elastin receptor-transduced signaling triggers activation of G proteins, opening of l-type calcium channels, and a sequential activation of tyrosine kinases: FAK, c-Src, platelet-derived growth factor-receptor kinase and then Ras-Raf-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 phosphorylation cascade. This, in turn, causes an increase in expression of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases, and a consequent increase in cellular proliferation. The EBP-transduced signals also induce tyrosine kinase-dependent phosphorylation of β-tubulin, LC3, microtubule-associated protein 1, and α-actin and troponin-T, which could be linked to reorganization of cytoskeleton. We have also disclosed that induction of these signals can be abolished by anti-EBP antibody or by galactosugars, which cause shedding of EBP from the cell surface. Moreover, elastin-derived peptides did not induce proliferation of EBP-deficient cells derived from patients bearing a nonsense mutation of the β-galactosidase gene or sialidase-deficient cells from patients with congenital sialidosis.

We found that two of those subunits (55- and 61-kDa) are anchored to the plasma membrane, whereas the third, a peripheral 67-kDa protein, actually binds elastin (25Hinek A. Wrenn D.S. Mecham R.P. Barondes S.H. Science. 1988; 239: 1539-1541Google Scholar). This major functional component of the receptor complex was named the elastin binding protein (EBP). The repeat hexapeptide in tropoelastin, VGVAPG, has been identified as a chief ligand for high affinity binding to this cell surface receptor (25Hinek A. Wrenn D.S. Mecham R.P. Barondes S.H. Science. 1988; 239: 1539-1541Google Scholar, 26Mecham R.P. Hinek A. Entwistle R. Wrenn D.S. Griffin G. Senior R.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3716-3722Google Scholar, 27Wrenn D.S. Hinek A. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 238: 2280-2284Google Scholar). It has been later established that diverse peptides maintaining GXXPG sequence, including the LGTIPG sequence present on the domain V of B1 chain of laminin, can also bind to the EBP and induce similar cellular effects (28Mecham R.P. Hinek A. Griffin G. Senior R.M. Liotta L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16652-16657Google Scholar, 29Mecham R.P. Whitehouse L. Hay M. Hinek A. Sheetz M.P. J.

Importantly, we found that the EBP has additional galactolectin properties (25Hinek A. Wrenn D.S. Mecham R.P. Barondes S.H. Science. 1988; 239: 1539-1541Google Scholar), hence, it may also bind moieties containing galactosugars through a separate binding domain. We have learned, however, that binding of these carbohydrate-bearing moieties causes conformational changes of the 67-kDa protein, so that it loses its ability to bind elastin and separates from the complex with other receptor subunits (1Hinek A. Mecham R.P. Keeley F.W. Rabinovitch M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 2083-2094Google Scholar, 25Hinek A. Wrenn D.S. Mecham R.P. Barondes S.H. Science. 1988; 239: 1539-1541Google Scholar). Sequencing of the EBP isolated from arterial SMC and molecular cloning led us to the discovery that this protein is identical to the 67-kDa, enzymatically inactive, alternatively spliced variant of human β-galactosidase (S-GAL) and that it binds elastin and laminin through the domain located in the unique frameshift-generated sequence (33Hinek A. Rabinovitch M. Keeley F.W. Okamura-Oho J. Callahan J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1198-1205Google Scholar, 34Privitera S. Prody C.A. Callahan J.W. Hinek A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6319-6326Google Scholar). We also characterized the 61-kDa subunit of the elastin receptor as sialidase (neuraminidase) (EC3.2.1.18) and the 55-kDa subunit as the protective protein, also called carboxypeptidase A or cathepsin A (EC 3.4.16.1) (35Hinek A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 471-480Google Scholar). Previous studies lead only to a partial disclosure of the signaling pathways that may be linked to the EBP. We, and others, show that interaction between elastin-derived peptides and EBP residing on the surface of several cell types results in a rapid and transient increase in free intracellular Ca2+ (18Hinek A. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 2: 185-193Google Scholar, 36Varga Z. Jacob M.P. Robert L. Fulop T. FEBS Lett. 1989; 258: 5-8Google Scholar) and that the EBP-mediated opening of calcium channels involves pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins and activation of phospholipase C and protein kinase C in fibroblasts and lymphocytes (21Fulop T. Jacob M.P. Wallach J. Hauck M. Seres I. Varga Z. Robert L.J. Soc. Biol. 2001; 195: 157-164Google Scholar, 38Faury G. Ristori M.T. Verdetti J. Jacob M.P. Robert L. J. Vasc. Res. 1995; 32: 112-119Google Scholar). Studies by Kamisato and colleagues (39Kamisato S. Uemura Y. Takami N. Okamoto K. J. Biochem. 1997; 121: 862-867Google Scholar, 40Kamisato S. Irie W. Uemura Y. Takami N. Okamoto K. Peptide Sci. 1999; 12: 61-64Google Scholar) additionally revealed that the EBP-dependent chemotactic response of macrophages to elastin-derived peptides also involves stimulation of cGMP and cGMP-dependent protein kinase. Brassart and colleagues (32Brassart B. Fuchs P. Huet E. Alix A.J. Wallach J. Tamburro A.M. Delacoux F. Haye B. Emonard H. Hornebeck W. Debelle L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5222-5227Google Scholar) reported that pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins and tyrosine kinase are involved in the EBP-mediated up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-2 in HT-1080 cancer cells. Because the abovementioned data clearly suggest that the cell surface EBP functions as a subunit of a true receptor capable of transmitting physiological signals from the extracellular matrix into the cell interior, the present studies have been aimed at a detailed disclosure of the intracellular signaling pathways generated by the association between elastin-derived peptides and the EBP. Culture media, fetal bovine serum, and other tissue culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen (Burlington, Ontario, Canada). Lactose, VGVAPG peptides, proteinase inhibitors, genistein, pertussis toxin, radicicol, PP2, PD98059, AG1295, AG1498, agarose-linked protein A, and all reagent grade chemicals were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Preparation of soluble elastin degradation products, κ-elastin was obtained from Elastin Product Co. (Owensville, MO). AG1478, PP2, and PD 98059 were purchased from Calbiochem Co. (San Diego, CA). Endoproteinase Lys-C was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Laval, Quebec, Canada). Monoclonal antibodies against phosphotyrosine (PY20), polyclonal antibodies against FAK, cyclin A, cyclin D1, cdk2, and cdk4 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal antibody (p44/42) to phosphorylated ERK 1/2 was obtained from Cell Signaling Co. (Beverly, MA). Polyclonal antibody to phospho-Src was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Polyclonal antibody to LC3 microtubule-associated protein 1 was a gift of Dr. J. Hammerback from Winston-Salem, NC. Species and type-specific secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, enhanced chemiluminescence kit, BrdUrd-based cell proliferation kit RPN 20, and [3H]thymidine were all purchased from Amersham Biosciences Canada Ltd. (Oakville, Ontario, Canada). Fluorescein-conjugated goat-anti rabbit secondary antibody was obtained from ICN Immuno-Biologicals (Lisle, IL). The platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) was from Collaborative Research Inc. (Bedford, MA). SMC were isolated by enzymatic digestion of porcine coronary arteries (CA) and cultured in Medium 199 supplement with 10% FBS as previously described (41Hinek A. Thyberg J. Connect. Tiss. Res. 1981; 8: 181-184Google Scholar). Second passage of CA SMC was then used in all experiments. Normal human skin fibroblasts, EBP-deficient fibroblasts derived from patients with GM1-gangliosidosis bearing a nonsense mutation of the β-galactosidase gene (42Hinek A. Zhang S. Smith A. Callahan J.W. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 23-36Google Scholar), and sialidase-deficient fibroblasts from patients with sialidosis (43Lukong K.E. Landry K. Elsliger M.A. Chang Y. Lefrancois S. Morales C.R. Pshezhetsky A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17286-17290Google Scholar) were also used. The mitogenic effects of the soluble elastin degradation products (κ-elastin) or VGVAPG peptide on cultured CA SMC were determined by immunodetection of BrdUrd with theAmersham Biosciences cell proliferation kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions and by the incorporation of [3H]thymidine (14Hinek A. Wilson S.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 925-938Google Scholar, 19Jung S. Rutka J.T. Hinek A. J. Neuropath. Exp. Neurol. 1988; 57: 429-448Google Scholar). Cells were plated in six-well dishes (1 × 105 cells/dish) and maintained for 24 h in Medium 199 containing 10% FBS. Cells were then transferred to serum-free medium for synchronization of their cell cycle. Seventy-two hours later, cells were transferred again, either to serum-free medium or to medium with 5% FBS and maintained in the presence or absence of 50 μg/ml κ-elastin and 2 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine for the next 48 h. Additionally, estimation of the growth curves in quadruplicate SMC cultures maintained for 1–7 days in the presence or absence of κ-elastin were also performed. At the end of each incubation period, cells from individual cultures (initially plated at 50,000 cells/dish) were trypsinized and counted in a cell counter. Total DNA was assayed at each end point using the DNeasy tissue system. To determine whether the mitogenic signal of κ-elastin was transmitted through the EBP, quadruplicate cultures of CA SMC were preincubated for 3 h with 50 mm lactose, which causes release of the EBP from the cell surface (1Hinek A. Mecham R.P. Keeley F.W. Rabinovitch M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 2083-2094Google Scholar, 18Hinek A. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 2: 185-193Google Scholar, 25Hinek A. Wrenn D.S. Mecham R.P.

Whitehouse L. Hay M. Hinek A. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 187-194Google Scholar), or with 5 μg/ml anti-S-GAL antibody, which blocks its elastin binding domain (33Hinek A. Rabinovitch M. Keeley F.W. Okamura-Oho J. Callahan J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1198-1205Google Scholar). They were then incubated with 2 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine for the next 48 h, in the presence or absence of these reagents and 50 μg/ml κ-elastin as described above. To determine whether other factors commonly involved in intracellular mitogenic signaling might also be required for the κ-elastin-induced mitogenic response, parallel quadruplicate cultures of CA SMC maintained for 48 h in the presence and absence of 50 μg/ml κ-elastin were also pretreated for 1 h and further exposed to 100 ng/ml G protein inhibitor, pertussis toxin (44Bokoch G.M. Katada T. Northup J.K. Hewlett E.L. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2072-2075Google Scholar), 10 μm tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genestin (45Akiyama T. Ishida J. Nakagawa S. Ogawara H. Watanabe S. Itoh N. Shibuya M. Fukami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 262: 5592-5595Google Scholar), 10 μm L-type calcium channel-blocker, nisoldipine (46Fleischmann B.K. Murray R.K. Kotlikoff M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11914-11918Google Scholar), 10 μm inhibitor of C-Src PP2 (47Salazar E.P. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28371-28378Google Scholar), 5 μminhibitor of Ras, radicicol (48Soga S. Kozawat T. Narumi H. Akinaga S. Iriel K. Matsumoto K. Sharmall S.V. Nakanot H. Mizukamit T. Harat M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 822-828Google Scholar), 50 μm MEK1/2 inhibitor, and PD98059 (49Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Google Scholar, 50Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Google Scholar) or with 10 μm PDGF receptor kinase inhibitor, AG1295 (51Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Google Scholar), and 10 μm EGF receptor kinase inhibitor, AG1498 (51Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Google Scholar). At the end of each experiment, the amount of thymidine incorporation was determined by liquid scintillation counting. All the above listed inhibitors were used in concentrations that were proven to be non-cytotoxic, when tested in a series of pilot experiments, in which SMC were treated with the increased concentrations of each inhibitor for different times ranging from 30 min to 12 h. In those experiments cell viability was assessed by the trypan blue exclusion test (marking dead cells) and by the neutral read incorporation into the living cells. The appearance of 20% more dead cells in the inhibitor-treated cultures than in untreated controls was considered as cytotoxic. The selected concentrations of inhibitors also allowed for reversibility of their anti-mitogenic effect 24 h after cessation of treatment and transfer to the media containing κ-elastin alone (tested by [3H]thymidine incorporation). To definitively demonstrate involvement of EBP and sialidase in the transduction of mitogenic signals, EBP-deficient cells derived from patients with GM1-gangliosidosis bearing a nonsense mutation of the β-galactosidase gene (42Hinek A. Zhang S. Smith A. Callahan J.W. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 23-36Google Scholar) and sialidase-deficient cells from sialidosis patients (43Lukong K.E. Landry K. Elsliger M.A. Chang Y. Lefrancois S. Morales C.R. Pshezhetsky A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17286-17290Google Scholar) were also exposed to κ-elastin and [3H]thymidine as described above. To demonstrate the lack of EBP expression in GM1-gangliosidosis fibroblasts bearing a nonsense mutation of the β-galactosidase gene, subconfluent cultures of these cells and normal fibroblasts were immunostained with anti-S-GAL antibody and counterstained with propidium iodide to visualize nuclei, as previously described (42Hinek A. Zhang S. Smith A. Callahan J.W. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 23-36Google Scholar). Cultures of CA SMCs (initially plated 1 × 105 cells/dish) incubated for 72 h in serum-free medium were exposed for different periods of time ranging from 15 min to 24 h to 50 μg/ml κ-elastin in the presence or absence of the various reagents inhibiting steps of intracellular signaling, as specified in the figure legends. At the end of each experiment cells were lysed by boiling in 62.5 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8, containing 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.001% bromphenol blue. Proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and then immunoblotted with anti-p-Tyr:PY20 antibody, with anti-FAK antibody, with anti-LC3 antibody, or with antibodies recognizing phosphorylated forms of c-Src and ERK 1/2 (anti-p-Src and anti-p-ERK 1/2) (all at 0.5 μg/ml). Cyclins D1, A, and E and cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk)4 and cdk2 were detected with specific anti-human polyclonal antibodies (all at 0.2 μg/ml). Expression of the EBP was also detected with anti-SGAL antibody in lysates of normal and GM1 fibroblasts. All blots were then treated with the appropriate secondary antibodies and examined using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system. The degree of expression or phosphorylation of immunodetected signaling molecules was measured by densitometry. Lysates of control and κ-elastin-treated cells were also immunoprecipitated with 3 μg/ml polyclonal anti-FAK antibody and subsequently treated with 50 μl of 4% Protein A-beaded agarose as previously described (33Hinek A. Rabinovitch M. Keeley F.W. Okamura-Oho J. Callahan J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1198-1205Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were then resolved at 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with 2.5 μg/ml monoclonal PY20 antibody recognizing phosphotyrosine. The reverse experiment was also performed. The lysates of κ-elastin-treated cells were resolved at 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Parallel membranes were then immunoblotted with anti-p-Tyr antibody or stained with Coomassie Blue. The blue bands matching those recognized with anti-p-Tyr antibody were dissected from the membranes, and proteins were extracted with a 1:1 mixture of 10% formic acid and 100% acetonitrile as described before (52Szewczyk B. Summers D.F. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 48-55Google Scholar). Extracted individual proteins were then dissolved in 50 μl of 25 mm Tris, pH 8.5, containing 1 mm EDTA and additionally subjected to further cleavage with 1 μg of endoproteinase Lys-C. The obtained cleavage products were separated by C-18 reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, and the major isolated peptide peaks were sequenced by gas phase protein sequencing (Porton Instruments, Tarzana, CA). The sequences obtained were then subjected to homology search by the Advanced BLAST at NCBI protein data base. Subconfluent cultures of SMC plated on cover slips were preincubated for 30 min in PBS containing 5 μm of Ca2+ ion-binding fluorochrome, Fura-2AM according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cultures were then washed extensively, covered with Medium 199 (containing 1% FBS, 1.8 mmCa2+), transferred to the incubation chamber, and monitored under an inverted fluorescent microscope (516-nm emission filter) connected to a charge-coupled device camera and a computerized video analysis system (Image-Pro Plus software for Macintosh, Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD) allowing the real-time analysis of the captured images. Images of 20 single cells were then captured in real-time after addition of 50 μg/ml κ-elastin to the incubation chamber. Intracellular influxes of free calcium ions were also analyzed by the perforated-patch method in voltage-clamp experiments.l-type Ca2+ currents were recorded at 37 °C from single SMCs and analyzed using microelectrode amplifiers (Axopatch 200B, Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) under software control (pCLAMP 7.0, Axon Instruments, Union City, CA), before and after addition of 50 μg/ml κ-elastin to the external solution as previously described (53Suto F. Habuchi Y. Yamamoto T. Tanaka H. Hamaoka J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 409: 213-221Google Scholar). Cultured SMC were scraped from the plastic dishes and suspended in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 5% bovine serum albumin and preincubated for 30 min with the fluorescent, Ca2+ -binding dye Fluo-4-AM diluted to a final concentration 3 μm. Cells were then washed in PBS, and separate aliquots containing 4 × 105 cells/ml were re-suspended in Medium 199 (containing 1.8 mmCa2+) and incubated for 10 min in the presence or absence of 0.1 m lactose, 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin, or the calcium channel blocker nisoldipine (1 μm). Influxes of Ca2+, marked by fluorescence, were monitored by a spectrometer at an emission wavelength of 488 nm and excitation wavelength of 516 nm. All parameters, immunodetection of incorporated BrdUrd, assessment of growth curves, and measurements of [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig.1), demonstrated that CA SMC significantly increased their proliferation rate after exposure to κ-elastin or to the synthetic VGVAPG peptide, mimicking a major ligand of the elastin receptor. The magnitude of elastin peptide-induced increase in cellular proliferation was more visible in cultures maintained in FBS-containing medium than in cultures maintained in serum-free medium. Treatment with κ-elastin also enhanced the magnitude of mitogenic response of CA SMC maintained in serum-free medium to PDGF-BB (Fig. 1 C). Conversely, the proliferative response to κ-elastin was significantly decreased when cells were both treated with lactose, which causes release of EBP molecules from the cell surface, or with anti-S-GAL antibody, which blocks the elastin binding domain of the EBP (Fig. 1, B andD). Further experiments demonstrated that κ-elastin-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation was blocked by preincubation of cultured SMC with inhibitors of G protein (pertussis toxin),l-type calcium channels (nisoldipine), tyrosine kinases (genistein), c-Src (PP2), Ras (radicicol), or MEK1/2 kinase (PD98059), and all abolished the κ-elastin-induced up-regulation (Fig.1 D). This suggested that EBP-induced mitogenic signaling requires G protein, l-type calcium channels, certain tyrosine kinase(s), and ERK1/2 MAPKs. We have also established that inhibitor of PDGF receptor kinase (AG1295), but not with EGF receptor kinase inhibitor (AG1498), caused a significant decrease in the magnitude of the κ-elastin-induced up-regulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation. Involvement of the EBP in the transduction of proliferative signals was additionally confirmed by the fact that EBP-deficient fibroblasts derived from patients with the congenital GM1-gangliosidosis (bearing a nonsense mutation of the β-galactosidase gene) did not increase their [3H]thymidine incorporation in response to κ-elastin or VGVAPG peptides (Fig. 2). Real-time fluorescence microscopy and patch clamping confirmed that SMC exposed to κ-elastin demonstrated a rapid transient influx of Ca2+ into the cytoplasm (Fig.3, A and B). Fluorometry additionally indicated that such κ-elastin-induced Ca2+ influxes were inhibited by nisoldipine and were not observed in cells deprived of cell surface EBP (pretreatment with lactose) or after blocking of G proteins with pertussis toxin (Fig.3 C). Western blot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody indicated that even 5-min exposure of SMC to κ-elastin led to tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins and that such κ-elastin-induced phosphorylation did not occur in cells preincubated with anti-EBP antibody, lactose, pertussis toxin, nisoldipine, or genistein (Fig.4 A). Immunoprecipitation with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody followed by immunoblotting with several antibodies recognizing proteins involved in the intracellular signaling further demonstrated that treatment with κ-elastin up-regulated levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of 125-kDa FAK, 60-kDa c-Src, as well as 42- to 44-kDa ERK1/2. Treatment with κ-elastin did not cause tyrosine phosphorylation of other MAPKs (JNK or P38) commonly involved in intracellular signaling (Fig. 4 B). Results depicted in Fig. 5 A show that κ-elastin-induced phosphorylation of 60-kDa c-Src did not occur in cells pretreated with lactose or in cells exposed to pertussis toxin and genistein but was not diminished in cells treated with an inhibitor of Ras (radicicol), nor an inhibitor of MEK1/2 (PD98059). These data indicated that elastin peptide-induced phosphorylation of c-Src depends on the presence of EBP and occurs downstream of G protein, but upstream of the Ras-Raf-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 phosphorylation cascade.Figure 5A, We"
https://openalex.org/W2023724309,"Chk1 is a serine-threonine kinase that plays an important role in the DNA damage response, including G2/M cell cycle control. UCN-01 (7-hydroxystaurosporine), currently in clinical trials, has recently been shown to be a potent Chk1 inhibitor that abrogates the G2/M checkpoint induced by DNA-damaging agents. To understand the structural basis of Chk1 inhibition by UCN-01, we determined the crystal structure of the Chk1 kinase domain in complex with UCN-01. Chk1 structures with staurosporine and its analog SB-218078 were also determined. All three compounds bind in the ATP-binding pocket of Chk1, producing only slight changes in the protein conformation. Selectivity of UCN-01 toward Chk1 over cyclin-dependent kinases can be explained by the presence of a hydroxyl group in the lactam moiety interacting with the ATP-binding pocket. Hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen-bonding interactions were observed in the structures between UCN-01 and the Chk1 kinase domain. The high structural complementarity of these interactions is consistent with the potency and selectivity of UCN-01.

The cellular response to DNA damage involves cell cycle delays, increased repair, and apoptosis (1Zhou B.-B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2645) Google Scholar). Although many effective cancer therapies work by causing cell death due to DNA damage, resistance to these therapeutic agents remains a significant limitation in the treatment of cancer. One important mechanism of drug resistance has been attributed to cell cycle delays, also called checkpoints, which provide opportunities for cells to repair DNA damage (2Hartwell L.H. Weinert T.A. Science. 1989; 246: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholar). Among different kinases mediating the DNA damage response, Chk1 kinase was shown to be involved in G2/M cell cycle control responding to DNA damage and to play an essential although less understood function during normal cell cycle function (3Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J.

Lush R.M. Murgo A. Figg W.D. Lahusen T. Jaken S. Jing X. Roberge M. Fuse E. Kuwabara T. Senderowicz A.M. J. Clin. Oncol. 2001; 19: 2319-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). UCN-01 potentiates the cytotoxicity of a variety of anticancer agents, including cisplatin, camptothecin, and ionizing radiation (9Wang Q. Fan S. Eastman A. Worland P.J. Sausville E.A. O'Connor P.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1996; 88: 956-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 10Bunch R.T. Eastman A. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 791-797PubMed Google Scholar, 11Shao R.G. Cao C.X. Shimizu T.

The latter findings have encouraged the investigation of UCN-01 in combination therapy for cancer treatment. Compared with staurosporine, UCN-01 is a more selective Chk1 inhibitor and is less potent against CDK1 (5Jackson J.R. Gilmartin A. Imburgia C. Winkler J.D. Marshall L.A. Roshak A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 566-572PubMed Google Scholar). However, a structural explanation for this selectivity has not been previously available. The x-ray structure for Chk1 kinase domain has recently been solved to 1.7 Å (12Chen P. Luo C. Deng Y. Ryan K. Register J. Margosiak S. Tempczyk-Russell A. Nguyen B. Myers P. Lundgren K. Kan C.C. O'Connor P.M. Cell. 2000; 100: 681-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). A crystal structure is also available for staurosporine-liganded CDK2, a close homolog of CDK1 (13Lawrie A.M. Noble M.E. Tunnah P. Brown N.R. Johnson L.N. Endicott J.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 796-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). To understand how UCN-01 binds to Chk1 and the structural basis for the selectivity of UCN-01 against CDKs, we determined the x-ray crystal structures of Chk1 in complex with UCN-01 and its analogs staurosporine and SB218078 and compared them with that of the CDK2·staurosporine complex. The structural information from these Chk1 binary complexes should increase our understanding of the structure-activity relationship for kinase inhibitors and its applications to structure-based drug design. The Chk1 kinase domain region, which contains the conserved kinase domain (residues 1–265), part of the linker region (residues 266–289) between the kinase domain and the FHA domain, and 6 His residues at the C terminus (12Chen P. Luo C. Deng Y. Ryan K. Register J. Margosiak S. Tempczyk-Russell A. Nguyen B. Myers P. Lundgren K. Kan C.C. O'Connor P.M. Cell. 2000; 100: 681-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), was subcloned into a pFastBac1 vector at theBamHI and XhoI sites for baculovirus expression. The resulting plasmid was transformed into competent DH10BacEscherichia coli cells according to the Bac-to-Bac method of Invitrogen to generate the high molecular weight bacmid DNA, which was then transfected into Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells. High titer stocks of the virus were generated and used to infect the cells for expression at 25 °C for 36 h. Harvested cells were suspended in the lysis buffer (50 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, containing 0.34 m sucrose, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm AEBSF), homogenized with a Tekmar Tissumizer, and disrupted with a model 110Y fluidizer (Microfluidics Corp., Newton, MA). The Chk1 kinase domain was purified from insect cells by sequential chromatography steps, including Q-Sepharose FastFlow, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, Source 15 Phenyl, and Sephacryl S200 columns at 4 °C. The solution buffer for the final column step was 25 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05% octylglucoside, 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 1 mm EDTA. Fractions containing a monomeric form of Chk1 were pooled and concentrated to about 7 mg/ml for crystallization. N-terminal sequencing and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the N-terminal Met of purified Chk1 was cleaved. The Chk1 assay was carried out in 50-μl volumes in the following buffer: 20 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT. A synthetic peptide with a sequence flanking Ser-216 of human Cdc25C, KVSRSGLYRSPSMPENLNRK, was used as its substrate. 2R. Johanson and B. Zhou, unpublished results. Chk1 was used at 5 nm, the peptide was used at 20 μm, and [γ-32P]ATP was used at 10 μm (final concentration). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min and stopped by adding 5 μl of acetic acid containing 10 mmATP. Thirty-microliter samples were spotted on 2-cm phosphocellulose filter disks, which were washed four times, 5 min each, with 0.5% phosphoric acid and counted by liquid scintillation. The apparentK m for ATP in the Chk1 assay was about 120 μm. CDK1 and CDK2 assays utilized the peptide Biotin-aminohexyl-ARRPMSPKKKA-NH2 as a phosphoryl group acceptor. CDK1 and CDK2 were expressed in a baculovirus expression system and were partially purified. Cyclin A was purified separately and mixed with CDK1 or CDK2 before assays. Typically, assays were performed by incubating enzyme (2 nm), in the presence or absence of inhibitor, 1.5 mm peptide substrate, 1.4 μm [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 mmMg2+ for periods of time generally within the range of 15 min. Reactions were terminated with equal volumes of either 20% acetic acid or 50 mm EDTA buffered to pH 7 (substrate consumption < 20%). The buffer employed in the enzyme assays was 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl and 5% Me2SO. Detection of peptide phosphorylation was accomplished by scintillation counting following collection of the peptide onto phosphocellulose filters. The apparentK m for ATP in both CDK1 and CDK2 assays are about 31 μm. CDK4 and cyclin D1 were expressed in a baculovirus expression system and subsequently purified. The catalytic activity of the CDK4 protein was assayed by measuring the phosphorylation of a truncated Rb protein (residues 773–928) fused to GST. The assay conditions were 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 μm GST-Rb protein, 0.7 μm [33P]ATP, 5 mmMgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, CDK4 enzyme (5 nm) in a final volume of 50 μl. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and terminated by the addition of 50 μl of quench (1 mm ATP, 100 mm EDTA, pH 7.0). Detection of protein phosphorylation was accomplished by trapping the protein onto phosphocellulose filters. The apparentK m for ATP in the CDK4 assay was 25 μm. IC50 values were determined by a least-squares fit to the equation, CPM = V max*(1 − ([I]/(IC50 + [I]))) + nsb (nonspecific binding). Because UCN-01, staurosporine, and SB-218078 bind to the ATP site of the kinase and are ATP-competitive inhibitors, the apparent K i was calculated based on the equation, K i,app = IC50/(1 + [ATP]/K m,ATP,app). Although the Chk1 kinase domain structure has been solved (12Chen P. Luo C. Deng Y. Ryan K. Register J. Margosiak S. Tempczyk-Russell A. Nguyen B. Myers P. Lundgren K. Kan C.C. O'Connor P.M. Cell. 2000; 100: 681-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), the coordinates were not available to us at the time of the experiments. We solved the structures of the apoenzyme and the complexes independently. The Chk1 kinase domain alone and its complexes with UCN-01, staurosporine, and SB218078 were crystallized using conditions (9% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, and 2% glycerol, at neutral pH) modified from those previously described (12Chen P. Luo C. Deng Y. Ryan K. Register J. Margosiak S. Tempczyk-Russell A. Nguyen B. Myers P. Lundgren K. Kan C.C. O'Connor P.M. Cell. 2000; 100: 681-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To obtain cocrystals with inhibitors, Chk1 was mixed with inhibitors 1 day before setting up crystallization drops. The crystals grew at 20 °C to ∼0.10 mm in size. All data were collected using the MARCCD165 detector at the Industrial Macromolecular Crystallography Association beam line 17-ID at the Advanced Photon Source in the Argonne National Laboratory (Chicago, IL). Before x-ray data collection, the crystals were equilibrated into a cryo-protectant solution containing 11% polyethylene glycol 8000 and 20% glycerol and were flash-frozen in a nitrogen cold stream at −180 °C. The apoenzyme crystal belongs to the monoclinic P21 space group with cell dimensions a = 45.0 Å, b = 65.9 Å, c = 58.1 Å and β = 93.9° and contains one molecule per asymmetric unit. The crystal diffracted to 1.65-Å resolution. All three cocrystals, Chk1·UCN-01, Chk1·staurosporine, and Chk1·SB218078, also belong to the P21 space group and diffracted to 1.8- or 2.0-Å resolution.

Open table in a new tab The starting phases for Chk1 were obtained by molecular replacement using coordinates of phosphorylase kinase (Protein Data Bank code 2PHK) (14Lowe E.D. Noble M.E. Skamnaki V.T. Oikonomakos N.G. Owen D.J. Johnson L.N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6646-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) as a search model in the program X-PLOR (15Brunger A.T. Version 3.1 Ed. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar). The phosphorylase kinase model was modified by replacing all residues (except glycine) with alanine. This model produced a rotation and translation function solution for Chk1 and provided starting phases with an R factor of 53% for reflections between 10 and 3.5 Å resolution at the beginning of the model building. The map calculated using the starting phases showed interpretable electron density for most side chains in both the N- and C-terminal domains. Density for several loops in the N-terminal domain and density for residues between 211 and 229 in the C-terminal domain was poor. The electron density improved after several cycles of model building and conventional least-squares refinement. Electron density interpretation and model building were done with the computer program O (16Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjelgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) using 2‖F obs‖−‖F calc‖ and ‖F obs‖−‖F calc‖ maps. Subsequent to each round of model building, refinements were carried out in X-PLOR (15Brunger A.T. Version 3.1 Ed. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar). Because there were still missing loops in both the N- and C-terminal domains, the program ARP/wARP (User Guide, version 5.1, EMBL) was used to refine and improve the model. Simulated annealing omit maps were used as needed to fit residues 15–22, 42–52, and 74–79. The model of the apoenzyme was further refined using the simulated annealing refinement with the program CNX (version 2000.1, Molecular Simulation Inc.) against all diffraction data between 20 and 1.65 Å. The final model of the apoenzyme kinase domain includes 264 residues in two polypeptide chains, 211 water molecules, and a sulfate ion. At the N terminus, one residue derived from the native sequence was not visible in the electron density map; residues 44–50 in the loop between strand β3 and helix C, and the last sixteen residues at the C terminus were also disordered. Most of the peptide torsion angles (99.0%) fall within the most favored regions or generally allowed regions of the Ramachandran (φ,ψ) diagram as defined in PROCHECK (17Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The three Chk1·inhibitor complex structures were solved and refined with the program ARP/wARP using the apoenzyme model for phase information. The best refinement result from ARP/wARP was obtained using the Chk1·staurosporine data, in which 246 residues were built in six chains, with R factor = 0.187 andR free = 0.257. After the enzyme model was completed, the inhibitors were built into the model based on difference electron density maps. Models for Chk1·UCN-01, Chk1·staurosporine, and Chk1·SB218078 were further refined using the simulated annealing refinement and followed by conventional refinement protocols with CNX. The results are summarized in Table I. We did not include all water atoms found by ARP/wARP in the current stage of refinement, resulting in slightly higher R factors for the structure models. Similar to other protein kinases, the Chk1 kinase domain (Fig. 1) is composed of two subdomains, an 88-residue N-terminal domain and a 210-residue C-terminal domain. The N-terminal domain is composed largely of β structure, the C-terminal domain is largely helical, and they are connected by an extended linker region (residues 84–89). The catalytic site is at the junction between these two domains (18Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). The models for Chk1·UCN-01, Chk1·staurosporine, and Chk1·SB-218078 contain the same number of residues as the apoenzyme but differ in the number of water molecules. The protein polypeptide chain conformations in the three models are very similar, with a root-mean-square (r.m.s.) deviation of 0.19 Å for all alpha carbons. Different from AMP-PNP binding, which does not cause noticeable conformational changes in Chk1 (12Chen P. Luo C. Deng Y. Ryan K. Register J. Margosiak S. Tempczyk-Russell A. Nguyen B. Myers P. Lundgren K. Kan C.C. O'Connor P.M. Cell. 2000; 100: 681-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), all three inhibitors cause a slight opening of the ATP-binding pocket. The differences in the glycine-rich loop (residues 16–23), in the loops between strand β3 and helix αC, and between strands β4 and β5 in the N-terminal domain, are visible when the apoenzyme was superimposed with the binary complexes (Fig. 2 A). Compared with the apoenzyme, the r.m.s. deviation for all alpha carbons in Chk1·UCN-01 is 0.37 Å. Inhibitor binding makes the enzyme more stable, as indicated by the higher quality of the electron density, lower temperature factors, and better refinement results (TableI). The glycine-rich loop (Gly16-Glu-Gly-Ala-Tyr-Gly-Glu-Val23) is in an open conformation with the side chain of Tyr20 toward the inhibitor. In the binary complexes, the ends of three loops in the N-terminal domain (residues 16–22, 42–52, and 74–78) are relatively flexible compared with the other parts of the model, as evidenced from their higher temperature factors. The activation loop of Chk1 (residues 148–175) is stable and folded into an open and active-like conformation without ligand binding (Fig.2 A). The conformation of the main chain of the activation loops in the apoenzyme and in the Chk1·UCN-01 complex are almost identical, differing only in a few side-chain conformations. Unlike the previously published Chk1 apoenzyme structure (12Chen P. Luo C. Deng Y. Ryan K. Register J. Margosiak S. Tempczyk-Russell A. Nguyen B. Myers P. Lundgren K. Kan C.C. O'Connor P.M. Cell. 2000; 100: 681-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), an additional 5-residue peptide was found to form an antiparallel β strand with β1. In the electron density maps for both the apoenzyme and the binary complexes, electron density previously unaccounted for was observed in the groove sandwiched by the β-sheets at the top of N-terminal domain (Fig. 2 B). However, the electron density of the side chains is not good enough to identify each residue in the pentapeptide. The distance between the first Cα of this peptide and the last Cα (Cα of Ala273) in the current model is 37 Å. This peptide could be a region at the end of the C terminus, because residues 274–289 are still missing from our model. Alternatively, the distance between the first Cα of this peptide and the Cα of Ala273 from a neighboring molecule is only 9.4 Å, it is also possible that this peptide comes from the C terminus of the neighboring molecule and contributes to the protein packing in the crystal. Compared with staurosporine, UCN-01 (chemical structures depicted in Fig.3 A) was reported to be a more selective Chk1 inhibitor and less potent against CDK1 (Refs. 5Jackson J.R. Gilmartin A. Imburgia C. Winkler J.D. Marshall L.A. Roshak A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 566-572PubMed Google Scholar, 6Graves P.R. Yu L. Schwarz J.K. Gales J. Sausville E.A. O'Connor P.M. Piwnica-Worms H. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2108-2112PubMed Google Scholar). We repeated these experiments and got very similar results as summarized in Fig. 3 B. In addition, we tested these compounds against CDK2 and CDK4 and calculated apparent K i from IC50 results. UCN-01, staurosporine, and SB-218078 bind to the ATP-binding pocket of the enzyme (Fig. 4, A–C) in the same mode. In the Chk1·UCN-01 complex, the inhibitor binds to the nucleotide-binding pocket formed between the N- and C-terminal domains with the tetrahydropyran ring in a boat conformation (Fig.4 A). One side of the hydrophobic core of the indolocarbazole makes many favorable van der Waals contacts with the backbone and side chains of residues from the N-terminal domain, which include Leu15, Tyr20, Val23, Ala36, Lys38, Leu84, and Tyr86. The other side of the indolocarbazole makes van der Waals interactions with the side chains of Val68, Leu137, and Asp148 from both the N- and C-terminal domains. The edge of the tetrahydropyran ring, sitting in the back of the pocket, interacts with the backbone and side chains of Glu55 and Asn59 from helix αC. The tetrahydropyran ring group sits in the ribose-binding pocket surrounded by Glu91, Asn135, Leu137, Ser147, and Asp148. The 6amino (N6) group of UCN-01 on the lactam moiety makes a hydrogen bond (2.8 Å) to the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Glu85, while the 5-keto (O5) of the inhibitor accepts a hydrogen bond (2.8 Å) from the amide nitrogen of Cys87 in the linker region. This hydrogen-bonding pattern is common in many known protein kinase·ATP complexes (19Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). The 6-amino and 5-keto groups replace two water molecules with low temperature factors in the apoenzyme structure. A similar replacement has also been found in CDK2 structures (13Lawrie A.M. Noble M.E. Tunnah P. Brown N.R. Johnson L.N. Endicott J.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 796-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The hydroxyl group (OH) sits in the back of the nucleotide-binding pocket pointing toward the C-terminal domain from the core planar structure of the indolocarbazole. The hydroxyl group of UCN-01 forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Ser147 and a water molecule. This water molecule interacts with two more waters, and through them hydrogen bonds with the main chain of Val68, and the side chains of Glu55 and Asn59. The other hydrogen bonds between UCN-01 and Chk1 involve the methylamine group of the glycosyl portion of the inhibitor. This group is protonated and positioned to form hydrogen bonds with the side-chain carboxyl group of Glu91 (2.8 Å) and the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Glu134 (3.0 Å) (Fig. 4 A). To accommodate UCN-01, several residues in the ATP-binding pocket, Leu15, Tyr20, Lys38, and Ser147, change conformations either to avoid unfavorable contacts or to make better contacts with the inhibitor. The side chain of Leu15 is flexible in the apoenzyme with no electron density visible but has a stable conformation after inhibitors are bound. The side-chain rotamer of Lys38 in the binary complex changes position from that in the apoenzyme, so that its extended aliphatic side chain can make a favorable interaction with UCN-01. The interactions between UCN-01 and the N-terminal domain residues, particularly those residues in the glycine-rich loop, are accompanied by a marked decrease in the average temperature factor of this region. Electron density for the end of the glycine-rich loop is particularly weak in the apoenzyme but is readily interpretable in the UCN-01 binary complex. UCN-01 binding slightly opens the glycine-rich loop, makes it more stable, and causes conformational changes in the side chains of residues 13–24. There is very weak electron density for the side chain of Tyr20 in the apoenzyme, but its electron density is clear in the binary complex. The side chain of this residue bends inwards toward the inhibitor molecule. Staurosporine makes similar hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds with the enzyme as UCN-01(Fig. 4 B). It has the same chemical structure except for the lack of the hydroxyl group on the lactam moiety (Fig. 3 A). The staurosporine 6amino group (N6) makes a hydrogen bond (2.8 Å) to the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Glu85, whereas the 5-keto oxygen (O5) of the inhibitor accepts a hydrogen bond (2.8 Å) from the amide nitrogen of Cys87 in the linker region. The side chain of Ser147 turns away from the inhibitor to avoid steric hindrance. In contrast to UCN-01 and staurosporine, SB218078 lacks a methylamine group and has carbonyl oxygens on either side of the N6 nitrogen (Fig.3 A). SB218078 binds in the same pocket as UCN-01, although its binary complex differs from the UCN-01 complex in the side-chain conformations of residues Glu91, Phe93, Glu134, Ser147, and Asp148 (Fig.4 C). SB218078 makes no direct contacts with Glu91 and Glu134. The corresponding hydrogen-bonding interactions of the maleimide moiety with the backbones of Glu85 and Cys87 in the linker region are the same as those of UCN-01. Compared with the Chk1·UCN-01 binary complex, SB218078 shifts slightly outwards from the pocket to avoid close contact between the 7-keto oxygen (O7) and the side chain of Leu84. As a result, the hydrogen bond between the NH group (N6) of SB218078 and the carbonyl O of Glu85 is shorter (<2.5 Å) than those in the Chk1·UCN-01 structures. Also, the distance between O5 and the amide N in the backbone of Cys87 increases from 2.8 Å to more than 2.9 Å. The complementarity between a ligand and a protein has been defined as the ratio of the solvent-accessible surface area of the protein buried by the binding of ligand and the solvent-accessible surface area of the ligand buried by the binding of the protein (20Janin J. Chothia C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16027-16030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As this ratio approaches 1, the interface between ligand and protein approaches a perfect fit, with no dead spaces where the two are close but not touching. For native ligands and tight binding inhibitors, the complementarity is expected to be high and has been measured at ∼80% for ATP in complex with CDK2 (21De Azevedo W.F. Mueller-Dieckmann H.J. Schulze-Gahmen U. Worland P.J. Sausville E. Kim S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2735-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Other inhibitor complexes with CDK2 have shown complementarity values between 70 and 86% (22Gray N. Detivaud L. Doerig C. Meijer L. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 859-875PubMed Google Scholar). These values reflect not only the ability of the ligand to adopt a conformation, which is complementary to the protein kinase binding site, but also the conformational changes the protein undergoes in response to binding the ligand.

https://openalex.org/W1994483207,"The molecular mechanisms of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR)-mediated neuroprotection remain unclear. In this study we provide evidence that nicotine stimulation of α7 nAChR transduces signals to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt via Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) in a cascade, which results in neuroprotection. Exposure to β-amyloid results in the activation of the apoptotic enzyme caspase-3 and cleavage of the DNA-repairing enzyme poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase. This cascade is inhibited by nicotine through JAK2 activation, and these effects are blocked by preincubation with the JAK2-specific inhibitor AG-490. We also found that pretreatment of cells with angiotensin II blocks the nicotine-induced activation of JAK2 via the AT2 receptor and completely prevents α7 nAChR-mediated neuroprotective effects further suggesting a pivotal role for JAK2. These findings identify novel mechanisms of receptor interactions relevant to neuronal viability and suggest novel therapeutic strategies to optimize neuroprotection.

The cholinergic deficit in Alzheimer's disease (AD) 1The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer's disease; JAK2, Janus kinase 2; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI-3-K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; α-Bgt, α-bungarotoxin; PC12, rat pheochromocytoma cells; Ang II, angiotensin II; JAK/STAT/Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription, 7AMC, 7- amino-4-methylcoumarin. has been clearly established and is the basis for the current symptomatic strategy. There is an early and significant depletion of high affinity nicotinic receptors in the brains of Alzheimer's patients (1Court J. Martin-Ruiz C. Piggott M. Spurden D. Griffiths M. Perry E. Biol. Psychiatry. 2001; 49: 175-184Google Scholar), and a number of studies have shown cognitive improvement in rodent and primates including humans following administration of ligands targeting nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) (2Newhouse P.A. Potter A. Kelton M. Corwin J. Biol. Psychiatry. 2001; 49: 268-278Google Scholar). In addition to their known symptomatic effects, neuronal nicotinic ligands have shown neuroprotective activity in vitro (3Donnelly-Roberts D.L. Xue I.C. Arneric S. Sullivan J.P. Brain Res. 1996; 719: 36-44Google Scholar) and in vivo(4Ryan R.E. Ross S.A. Drago J. Loiacono R.E. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 1650-1656Google Scholar) suggesting an additional potential for disease modification. The α7 nAChR forms functional homomeric ligand-gated ion channels that promote rapidly desensitizing Ca2+ influx, is widely expressed throughout the mammalian brain, and has been implicated in sensory gating, cognition, and neuroprotection (5Seo J. Kim S. Kim H. Park C.H. Jeong S. Lee J. Choi S.H. Chang K. Rah J. Koo J. Kim E. Suh Y. Biol. Psychiatry. 2001; 49: 240-247Google Scholar). In addition, nicotine-induced neuroprotection against β-amyloid-induced toxicity is suppressed by α-bungarotoxin (α-Bgt), and the selective α7 nAChR agonist, anabasine-derived 3-(4)-dimethylaminocinnamylidine, exerts cytoprotective effects (6De Fiebre C.M. Meyer E.M. Henry J.C. Muraskin S.I. Kem W.R. Papke R.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 164-171Google Scholar, 7Kem W.R. Behav. Brain Res. 2000; 113: 169-181Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent study (8Kihara T. Shimohama S. Sawada H. Honda K. Nakamizo T. Shibasaki H. Kume T. Akaike A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13541-13546Google Scholar), has reported that the levels of phosphorylated Akt, an effector of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3-K), are increased by nicotine and that the nicotine-induced cytoprotective effects are suppressed by the PI-3-K inhibitors (LY294002 and wortmannin). These findings suggest that the α7 nAChR transduces signals to PI-3-K in a cascade, which ultimately contributes to a neuroprotective effect against Aβ-(1–42). In comparison to the findings above, another study (9Dineley K.T. Westerman M. Bui D. Bell K. Ashe K.H. Sweatt J.D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4125-4133Google Scholar) has shown that whereas nicotine activates the PI-3-K neuroprotective cascade, Aβ-(1–42) chronically activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade via the hippocampal α7 nAChR. The investigators suggest that this chronic activation of the MAPK pathway by Aβ-(1–42) eventually leads to the down-regulation of MAPK which then sets up a positive feedback for Aβ accumulation and decreased phosphorylation of the cAMP-regulatory protein which is a necessary component for hippocampus-dependent memory formation in mammals (9Dineley K.T. Westerman M. Bui D. Bell K. Ashe K.H. Sweatt J.D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4125-4133Google Scholar). The angiotensin-converting enzyme density is also increased in the temporal cortex from patients with AD (10Barnes N.M. Cheng C.H. Costall B. Naylor R.J. Williams T.J. Wischik C.M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 200: 289-292Google Scholar), and the angiotensin-converting enzyme genotype is associated with AD in some populations (11Narain Y. Yip A. Murphy T. Brayne C. Easton D. Evans J.G. Xuereb J. Cairns N. Esiri M.M. Furlong R.A. Rubinsztein D.C. J. Med. Genet. 2000; 37: 695-697Google Scholar). The angiotensin II (Ang II) AT2 receptor exerts growth inhibitory effects or apoptosis both in cultured cells and in vivo (12Horiuchi M. Akishita M. Dzau V.J. Endocr. Res. 1998; 24: 307-314Google Scholar) are expressed in PC12 cells, and have been shown to inhibit the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling cascade (13Horiuchi M. Hayashida W. Akishita M. Tamura K. Daviet L. Lehtonen J.Y. Dzau V.J. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 876-882Google Scholar). In this study we show that nicotine-induced neuroprotection against Aβ-(1–42) is mediated through tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2, subsequent activation of PI-3-K and Akt, and inhibition of both caspase-3 activity and cleavage of the DNA-repairing enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). In contrast, pretreatment of cells with Ang II blocks the nicotine-induced activation of JAK2 via the AT2 receptor and completely prevents α7 nAChR-mediated neuroprotective effects. Molecular weight standards, acrylamide, SDS,N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide,N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylenediamine, protein assay reagents, and nitrocellulose membranes were purchased from Bio-Rad. Protein A/G-agarose was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum, trypsin, and all medium additives were obtained from Mediatech Inc. (Herndon, VA). Monoclonal antibody to phosphotyrosine (PY20), JAK2, Akt, and PI-3-K were procured from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-phospho-Akt and PARP antibodies were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Anti-phosphotyrosine JAK2 antibody was obtained from BIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA). The Pierce Supersignal substrate chemiluminescence detection kit was obtained from Pierce. Goat anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG were acquired from Amersham Biosciences, and Tween 20, nicotine, Aβ-(1–42) peptide, anti-Aβ-(1–42) and anti-7 nAChR and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. PC12, rat pheochromocytoma cells, were maintained in proliferative growth phase in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal calf serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA), and antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin) according to routine protocols (14Bencherif M. Lovette M.E. Fowler K.W. Arrington S. Reeves L. Caldwell W.S. Lippiello P.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 279: 1413-1421Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of JAK2 and Akt proteins was determined in serum-starved PC12 cells stimulated with 10 μm nicotine (0–120 min) in the presence or absence of 10 μm (1 h preincubation) of the JAK2-specific inhibitor AG-490 (15Meydan N. Grunberger T. Dadi H. Shahar M. Arpaia E. Lapidot Z. Leeder J. Freedman M. Cohen A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Roifman C. Nature. 1996; 379: 645-648Google Scholar, 16Dicou E. Attoub S. Gressens P. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 3947-3951Google Scholar). Whereas many tyrosine kinase inhibitors are often promiscuous in the enzyme they target, AG-490 is unique in that it does not inhibit other tyrosine kinases such as Lck, Lyn, Btk, Syk, Src, JAK1, or Tyk2 (15Meydan N. Grunberger T. Dadi H. Shahar M. Arpaia E. Lapidot Z. Leeder J. Freedman M. Cohen A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Roifman C. Nature. 1996; 379: 645-648Google Scholar). At the end of stimulation, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBSV (phosphate-buffered saline with 1 mmol/liter Na3VO4). Each dish was then treated for 60 min with ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mmol/liter EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 mmol/liter Na4P2O7, 50 mmol/liter NaF, 1 mmol/liter Na3VO4, and 1 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the supernatant fraction was obtained as cell lysate by centrifugation at 58,000 ×g for 25 min at 4 °C. Samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and blocked by a 60-min incubation at 22 °C in TTBS (Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4) plus 5% skimmed milk powder. The nitrocellulose membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with affinity-purified anti-phospho-specific JAK2 and Akt antibodies. The nitrocellulose membranes were washed twice for 10 min with TTBS and incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate. After extensive washing, the bound antibody was visualized on a Kodak Biomax film using a Pierce Supersignal substrate chemiluminescence detection kit. The cell lysate, prepared as described above, was incubated with 10 μg/ml anti-PI-3-K monoclonal antibodies at 4 °C for 2 h and precipitated by addition of 50 μl of protein A/G-agarose at 4 °C overnight. The immunoprecipitates were recovered by centrifugation and washed three times with ice-cold wash buffer (Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmol/liter Na3VO4). Immunoprecipitated proteins were dissolved in 100 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, and 80 μl of each sample were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Samples were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and blocked by 60-min incubation at room temperature (22 °C) in TTBS plus 5% skimmed milk powder. The nitrocellulose membrane was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml affinity-purified anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, and the bound antibodies were visualized using a Pierce Supersignal chemiluminescence detection kit. Apoptosis was determined by assessing the cleavage of the DNA-repairing enzyme PARP using a Western blot assay. PARP (116-kDa) is an endogenous substrate for caspase-3, which is cleaved to a typical 85-kDa fragment during various forms of apoptosis. PC12 cells were treated with 0.1 μm Aβ for 8 h in the presence or absence of nicotine and/or AG-490. The cells were collected, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 1 ml of SDS-PAGE sample buffer boiled for 10 min. Total cell lysates (30 μg of protein) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked for 1 h at 25 °C with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mNaCl, 0.05% Tween 20). Membranes were incubated with primary PARP antibody specific for the 85-kDa fragment for 2–3 h at 25 °C, rinsed with TBST, and incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h at 25 °C. Immunodetection was performed with appropriate antibody using an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Caspase-3 enzyme activity was determined with a fluorogenic substrate for caspase-3 in crude PC12 cell extracts. The caspase-3 fluorogenic peptide Ac-DEVD-AMC (Promega, Madison, WI) contained the specific caspase-3 cleavage sequence (DEVD) coupled at the C terminus to the fluorochrome 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin. The substrate emitted a blue fluorescence when excited at a wavelength of 360 nm. When cleaved from the peptide by the caspase-3 enzyme activity in the cell lysate, free 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin was released and was detected by its yellow/green emission at 460 nm. Appropriate controls included a reversible aldehyde inhibitor of caspase-3 to assess the specific contribution of the caspase-3 enzyme activity (data not shown). Fluorescence units were normalized relative to total protein concentration of the cell extract. We performed the assays in triplicate and repeated the experiments three times. In addition we measured the decrease in PC12 cell number using a Coulter counter (model ZM, Coulter, Hialeah, FL). All statistical comparisons were made using Student's t test for paired data and analysis of variance. Significance was p < 0.05. JAK2 was tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to nicotine within 5–10 min, and this activation remained above basal levels even after longer exposure (120 min) to nicotine (Fig.1). The JAK2 inhibitor AG-490 inhibited the basal and nicotine-stimulated JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation, the tyrosine phosphorylation of PI-3-K, and the serine phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 1). Similar results were observed in the human cell line SH-SY5Y (data not shown). These results suggest that JAK2 activation by nicotine precedes the activation of PI-3-K and its effector Akt. JAK2 activation is completely prevented by preincubation of α-Bgt indicating a receptor-mediated effect (Fig.2 A).Figure 2A, JAK2 phosphorylation is blocked by α-bungarotoxin. PC12 cells were stimulated with nicotine for the time indicated in the presence or absence of α-bungarotoxin, and cells were immunoblotted with phospho-specific and non-phospho-specific anti-JAK2. Similar results were obtained in three experiments.B, effects of nicotine on the JAK2 complex formation with the α7 nAChR. Left panel, PC12 cells were stimulated with nicotine for the time indicated.

PC12 cells treated with Aβ-(1–42) peptide in the presence of nicotine (Nic.) with or without AG-490 are shown in the3rd and 4th lanes, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To test the hypothesis that JAK2 interacts directly with α7 nAChR we conducted co-immunoprecipitation studies using a rabbit polyclonal anti-JAK2 antibody. We stimulated cultured PC12 cells with nicotine (10 μm) for various times, lysed the cells, and immunoprecipitated JAK2 with anti-JAK2 antibody. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with anti-α7 nAChR antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2 B, nicotine induced a rapid association of JAK2 with the α7 nAChR within 5 min. This time course of α7 nAChR association with JAK2 was similar to that of the nicotine-induced activation of JAK2 (Fig. 1). Similar results were also obtained when the experiments were repeated using α7 nAChR receptor antibody to immunoprecipitate the receptor and to probe the Western blot with the anti-JAK2 antibody (Fig. 2 B). Recent studies (17Wang H.Y. Lee D.H. D'Andrea M.R. Peterson P.A. Shank R.P. Reitz A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5626-5632Google Scholar, 18Liu Q. Kawai H. Berg D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4734-4739Google Scholar) have shown that Aβ-(1–42) binds with high affinity to α7 nAChR, and this interaction can be inhibited by α7 nAChR antagonist. In these sets of experiments we confirmed the molecular association between Aβ-(1–42) and α7 nAChR in cells treated with Aβ-(1–42) (10 μmfor 5 min) and immunoprecipitated with the anti-Aβ-(1–42) antibodies. Western analyses identified a 57-kDa protein reactive to anti-α7 nAChR which co-immunoprecipitated with Aβ-(1–42) (Fig.2 C). This effect was not prevented by AG-490 pretreatment of cells (Fig. 2 C), and when the cells were co-incubated with 10 μm nicotine the complex formation between Aβ-(1–42) and α7 nAChR was blocked even in the presence of AG-490 (Fig.2 C). These results suggest that the interaction between Aβ-(1–42) and α7 nAChR can be inhibited by nicotine independently of JAK2. Furthermore, treatment of PC12 cells with Aβ-(1–42) (0.1–1 μm) did not induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 (Fig. 3) even at higher concentrations (10 and 100 μm; data not shown). Moreover, co-incubation of the cells with 0.1 μm Aβ-(1–42) had no effect on the nicotine-stimulated JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation, the tyrosine phosphorylation of PI-3-K, and the serine phosphorylation of Akt (Fig.4).Figure 4Effects of Aβ-(1–42) on nicotine-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 and PI-3-K plus serine phosphorylation of Akt. PC12 cells co-incubated in the presence or absence of 0.1 μm Aβ-(1–42) were stimulated with nicotine for the time indicated. Cells were immunoblotted with phospho-specific and non-phospho-specific anti-JAK2 and anti-Akt antibodies or with anti-PI-3-K antibody. The PI-3-K-immunoprecipitated proteins were then immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-PI-3-K antibodies. Results shown are representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Caspase-3 is expressed in PC12 cells and is known to be involved in apoptosis. We examined caspase-3 activity following Aβ-(1–42)-induced apoptosis. We used the fluorescent peptide substrate Ac-DEVD-7AMC to measure caspase-3-like activity in cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 5, the caspase-3-like activity that resulted in the cleavage of the peptide substrate Ac-DEVD-7AMC is evident after 4 h of Aβ-(1–42) treatment and increased over time until it reached a peak after 8 h of treatment. The Aβ-(1–42)-induced activation of caspase-3 was blocked by nicotine (p < 0.01), and this inhibition was prevented by AG-490 (Fig. 5). We explored further the activation of caspase-3 following Aβ-(1–42) treatment by measuring the cleavage of the DNA-repairing enzyme PARP using Western blot assay. PARP is an endogenous substrate for caspase-3, which is cleaved to a typical 85-kDa fragment during various forms of apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 6, PARP (116-kDa) was cleaved to its 85-kDa fragment following Aβ-(1–42) treatment. Again, just like the activation of caspase-3, the Aβ-(1–42)-induced cleavage of PARP was blocked by nicotine, and this inhibition was prevented by AG-490 and Ang II (Fig. 6). This PARP cleavage further indicates that caspase-3 or caspase-3-like proteases are activated in Aβ-(1–42)-induced cells death. We tested the involvement of JAK2 in nicotine-induced neuroprotection in the presence or absence of Aβ-(1–42). We measured the decrease in PC12 cell number using a Coulter counter following Aβ-(1–42) and Ang II treatments in the presence or absence of nicotine and AG-490. As shown in Fig. 7, cell death induced by Aβ-(1–42) treatment was significantly reduced in the presence of nicotine (p < 0.01). Nicotine had no effect on Aβ-(1–42)-induced cell death when co-incubated with AG-490 (Fig. 7). These results suggest that JAK2 plays an essential role in the nicotine-induced neuroprotection against Aβ-(1–42)-induced cell death. In contrast, Ang II-induced apoptosis was not affected by nicotine (Fig. 7). Preincubation of PC12 cells with Ang II blocked the nicotine-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 via the AT2 receptor (Fig.8). This inhibition was completely prevented by preincubation with an AT2 antagonist (PD 123177 at 100 nm) but not by an AT1 antagonist (candesartan at 100 nm) consistent with the receptor phenotype expressed in PC12 cells. This inhibition of nicotine-induced JAK2 phosphorylation was accompanied by a complete reversal of nicotine-induced neuroprotection as shown by the nicotine-insensitive PARP cleavage and cell viability (Fig. 6 and Fig. 7). In this study we provide evidence for the nicotine-induced complex formation between the α7 nAChR and the tyrosine-phosphorylated enzyme JAK2 that results in subsequent activation of PI-3-K and Akt. We also provide evidence that nicotine interaction with the α7 nAChR is “dominant” over Aβ-(1–42) interaction with the receptor and that the Aβ-(1–42)-induced apoptosis is prevented through the nicotine-induced activation of JAK2. Finally, we also found that the nicotine neuroprotective effects can be neutralized through activation of the angiotensin II AT2 receptor as evidenced by the reversal of JAK2 phosphorylation and inhibition of nicotine-induced neuroprotection. Nicotinic neurotransmission is compromised in the brains of AD patients and selective loss of nAChR predominates in brain regions with β-amyloid deposition (1Court J. Martin-Ruiz C. Piggott M. Spurden D. Griffiths M. Perry E. Biol. Psychiatry. 2001; 49: 175-184Google Scholar). A direct interaction of the β-amyloid peptide with the α7 nAChR is suggested by recent findings. β-Amyloid peptide interacts with high affinity to the α7 nAChR and results in functional non-competitive blockade in hippocampal neurons (17Wang H.Y. Lee D.H. D'Andrea M.R. Peterson P.A. Shank R.P. Reitz A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5626-5632Google Scholar, 18Liu Q. Kawai H. Berg D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4734-4739Google Scholar). In addition, a recent study (9Dineley K.T. Westerman M. Bui D. Bell K. Ashe K.H. Sweatt J.D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4125-4133Google Scholar) has also shown that Aβ-(1–42) chronically activates the MAPK cascade via the hippocampal α7 nAChR and that this chronic activation leads to derangement of hippocampus signal transduction in the AD brain. On the other hand, neuroprotective mechanisms mediated by nicotine in clonal cells have implicated the tyrosine phosphorylation of PI-3-K (8Kihara T. Shimohama S. Sawada H. Honda K. Nakamizo T. Shibasaki H. Kume T. Akaike A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13541-13546Google Scholar), an enzyme involved in phosphoinositide metabolism and linked to cell survival and apoptosis. Anti-apoptotic signals transduced via JAK2 have also been reported. For example, in hematopoietic cells, the kinase domain of JAK2 mediates the induction of Bcl-2 and inhibits cell death (19Sakai I. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12350-12358Google Scholar), and treatment with the JAK2 inhibitor AG-490 reduces the phosphorylation of PI-3-K (20Kumano K. Nakao A. Nakajima H. Miike S. Kurasawa K. Saito Y. Iwamoto I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 209-214Google Scholar) and STAT3 resulting in an increase in caspase-3 activity and Bax protein in acute myocardial infarction (21Negoro S. Kunisada K. Tone E. Funamoto M. Oh H. Kishimoto T. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 47: 797-805Google Scholar). In addition, activation of neuronal erythropoietin receptors prevents apoptosis by triggering cross-talk between the signaling pathways of JAK2 and the nuclear factor-κB (22Digicaylioglu M. Lipton S.A. Nature. 2001; 412: 641-647Google Scholar). Our findings indicate that α7 nAChR activation induces JAK2 activation via tyrosine phosphorylation and that this initial event is followed by tyrosine phosphorylation of PI-3-K and Akt serine phosphorylation as indicated by the inhibitory effect of AG-490 on the phosphorylation of both proteins. The JAK2 phosphorylation in the presence of nicotine is completely inhibited by α-Bgt, an antagonist to α7 nAChR. Our findings indicate that nicotine-stimulated α7 nAChR results in the formation of a complex between the α7 nAChR protein and JAK2. Because interaction between α7 nAChR and Aβ-(1–42) has been reported based on ligand binding and functional studies, we tested the possibility that β-amyloid could also induce an α7 nAChR-JAK2 complex. Our results confirm the association of β-amyloid and α7 nAChR but indicate no detectable levels of JAK2. In the presence of nicotine, no Aβ immunoreactivity can be detected in the lysate suggesting that nicotine has “displaced” Aβ from α7 nAChR. This effect is independent of JAK2 phosphorylation as shown by the lack of any reversal of this effect in the presence of AG-490. It is well established that nicotine inhibits Aβ toxicity, but the mechanism is unclear. Our results demonstrate a central role for JAK2 in the α7 nAChR activation of key cellular enzymes involved in cell survival and in inhibition of pro-apoptotic pathways. Nicotine inhibits β-amyloid cytotoxicity, and this effect is completely prevented by inhibition of the tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2. These effects can be shown by measuring markers of cytotoxicity like the cleavage of the nuclear protein PARP, the induction of caspase-3, or cell viability. Several reports have documented the apoptotic effects of Ang II through AT2 receptors. AT2 receptors are expressed in PC12 and have been shown to inhibit the JAK/STAT signaling cascade (23Kunioku H. Inoue K. Tomida M. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 309: 13-16Google Scholar). In contrast to nicotine-induced neuroprotection against β-amyloid-(1–42), pretreatment of cells with Ang II blocks the nicotine-induced activation of JAK2 via the AT2 receptor and completely prevents α7 nAChR-mediated neuroprotective effects further suggesting a pivotal role for JAK2 phosphorylation. Our findings are consistent with opposite roles on cell viability between α7 nAChR and AT2 receptor, activation of the latter overriding the potential benefit through the former (Fig.9). These results and the convergence of these pathways on phosphorylated JAK2 suggest that recruitment of α7 receptor-mediated neuroprotection against Aβ-(1–42) may be optimized under conditions where AT2-mediated inhibition is minimized. These findings identify novel molecular mechanisms that are fully consistent with the role attributed to α7 nAChR, AT2, and β-amyloid on the pathophysiology observed in the brains of Alzheimer's patients."

Histochemical promoter-β-glucuronidase (GUS) studies identified AAP6 expression in xylem parenchyma, cells requiring high affinity transport due to the low amino acid concentration in xylem sap. AAP6 may thus function in uptake of amino acids from xylem. Histochemical analysis of AAP8 revealed stage-dependent expression in siliques and developing seeds. Thus AAP8 is probably responsible for import of organic nitrogen into developing seeds. The only missing transporter of the family AAP7 was nonfunctional in yeast with respect to amino acid transport, and expression was not detectable. Therefore, AAP6 and -8 are the only members of the family able to transport aspartate with physiologically relevant affinity. AAP1, -6 and -8 are the closest AAP paralogs. Although AAP1 and AAP8 originate from a duplicated region on chromosome I, biochemical properties and expression pattern diverged. Overlapping substrate specificities paired with individual properties and expression patterns point to specific functions of each of the AAP genes in nitrogen distribution rather than to mere redundancy. Arabidopsis amino acid transporters (AAPs) show individual temporal and spatial expression patterns. A new amino acid transporter, AAP8 was isolated by reverse transcription-PCR.

Overlapping substrate specificities paired with individual properties and expression patterns point to specific functions of each of the AAP genes in nitrogen distribution rather than to mere redundancy. Inorganic nitrogen taken up by the root system is reduced to amino acids in roots and shoots and subsequently is distributed via the vascular tissue to supply all growing organs. Ions and other solutes including amino acids cycle within the whole plant, enter the vascular system at sites of overproduction, and are taken out of the system where required (1Jeschke W.D. Wolf O. Pate J.S. Bonnemain J.L. Delrot S. Lucas W.J. Dainty J. Recent Advances in Phloem Transport and Assimilate Compartmentation. Ouest Editions, Nantes, France1990Google Scholar). Thus at various places in the plant, transporters for amino acids are required, e.g. for loading of the phloem in leaves, loading of the xylem in roots, transfer of amino acids between the two vascular systems, and for unloading in developing seeds. While the loading of the phloem is partially understood in the case of sucrose thus providing a model for amino acid loading, no metabolite carriers are known that play a role in loading and unloading of the xylem. Amino acids can enter the xylem in roots (2Schobert C. Komor E. Planta. 1990; 181: 85-90Google Scholar), and xylem-borne amino acids are exported from the xylem to the surrounding tissue (3McNeil D.L. Atkins C.A. Pate J.S. Plant Physiol. 1979; 63: 1076-1081Google Scholar). Uptake of amino acids into xylem parenchyma follows biphasic Michaelis-Menten kinetics suggesting that several transport systems with different kinetic properties are involved (4Van Bel A.J.E. van der Schoot C. Plant Sci. Lett. 1980; 19: 101-107Google Scholar). Physiological studies show that large parts of amino acids fed directly into the xylem sap appear unchanged in the phloem sap, indicating that amino acids can be transported from xylem to phloem, thus leading to a cycling within the plant (5Pate J.S. Sharkey P.J. Lewis O.A.M. Planta. 1975; 122: 11-26Google Scholar). To be taken up from the apoplasm into xylem parenchyma cells, active transport processes are necessary to cross the plasma membrane. For the movement of protons and other ions transporters and translocators were identified in the plasma membrane of xylem parenchyma cells (6Maathuis F.J. Ichida A.M. Sanders D. Schroeder J.I. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 1141-1149Google Scholar). Since concentrations of amino acids in the xylem are about 10-fold lower than in the phloem sap (7Lam H.M. Coschigano K. Schultz C. Melo-Oliveira R. Tjaden G. Oliveira I. Ngai N. Hsieh M.H. Coruzzi G. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 887-898Google Scholar), a high affinity transporter would be necessary in xylem parenchyma cells to mediate the described xylem to phloem transfer. For transport in the reverse direction, to enter the xylem tracheids, amino acids must be exported into the apoplast to diffuse in the xylem sap. Transfer of amino acids between phloem and xylem is in some cases specific, e.g. in lupins where especially asparagine and glutamine contribute to the N enrichment in the phloem (8Atkins C.A. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 27: 531-537Google Scholar). The transfer activities lead to changes in the composition of the phloem sap on its way to the developing seeds (9Hayashi H. Okada Y. Mano H. Kume T. Matsuhashi S. Ishioka N.S. Uchida H. Chino M. Plant Soil. 1997; 196: 233-237Google Scholar). The import of amino acids into seeds that occurs mainly via the phloem requires efficient exchange mechanisms between xylem and phloem (10Pate J.S. Sharkey P.J. Atkins C.A. Plant Physiol. 1977; 59: 506-510Google Scholar). As a last step, the seeds have to be able to take up the amino acids arriving through the phloem. High affinity transport of all available amino acids is an essential prerequisite for seed development since the accumulation of storage proteins must be preceded by an import of amino acids. It could be shown that the expression of the amino acid transporter in seeds precedes the expression of the storage protein AtS1 in Arabidopsis (11Hirner B. Fischer W.N. Rentsch D. Kwart M. Frommer W.B. Plant J. 1998; 14: 535-544Google Scholar). A similar increase in the expression of a legume amino acid transporter has been shown recently in Vicia faba (12Miranda M. Borisjuk L. Tewea A. Heim U. Sauer N. Wobus U. Weber H. Plant J. 2001; 28: 61-71Google Scholar). In pea it has been demonstrated that PsAAP1 is expressed in the transfer cell layer of cotyledons and might be responsible for taking up amino acids released from the seed coat (13Tegeder M. Offler C.E. Frommer W.B. Patrick J.W. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 319-326Google Scholar). Among the different transporter genes identified inArabidopsis so far, AAP1 and AAP2 were most highly expressed in immature siliques of Arabidopsis, indicating a role in supplying developing seeds with organic nitrogen. Biochemical properties of these transporters characterize them as low affinity transport systems (14Fischer W.N. Loo D.D.F. Koch W. Ludewig U. Boorer K.J. Tegeder M. Rentsch D. Wright E.M. Frommer W.B. Plant J. 2002; 29: 1-18Google Scholar). In analogy to sucrose transporters, one may also expect that multiple transporters with differing kinetic characteristics are responsible for import into seeds. This would allow the growing seed to adapt to varying N-supply and alteration in amino acids available. In Arabidopsis glutamate, aspartate, glutamine, and asparagine are the major transport forms of amino acids distributed through phloem and xylem (7Lam H.M. Coschigano K. Schultz C. Melo-Oliveira R. Tjaden G. Oliveira I. Ngai N. Hsieh M.H. Coruzzi G. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 887-898Google Scholar). Concentration and composition of amino acids in phloem and mesophyll cytosol are similar, whereas a concentration gradient can be found between the apoplast and the phloem sap (15Lohaus G. Winter H. Riens B. Heldt H.W. Bot. Acta. 1995; 108: 270-275Google Scholar). This gradient indicates that active transport systems are involved in uptake of amino acids from the apoplast into the phloem. Complex kinetics and phase transitions in uptake depending on the amino acid concentrations have been described for barley roots (16Soldal T. Nissen P. Physiol. Plant. 1978; 43: 181-188Google Scholar). In sugar beet vesicles uptake studies revealed multiphasic kinetics as well as pH dependence for amino acid uptake (17Li Z. Bush D.R. Plant Physiol. 1990; 94: 268-277Google Scholar, 18Li Z.C. Bush D.R. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 1338-1344Google Scholar). In agreement with the complex physiology and uptake studies, multiple amino acid transporter genes have been isolated from Arabidopsis by complementation of yeast transport mutants with plant cDNAs (19Frommer W.B. Hummel S. Riesmeier J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5944-5948Google Scholar, 20Hsu L. Chiou T. Chen L. Bush D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7441-7445Google Scholar, 21Kwart M. Hirner B. Hummel S. Frommer W.B. Plant J. 1993; 4: 993-1002Google Scholar, 22Fischer W.N. Kwart M. Hummel S. Frommer W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16315-16320Google Scholar, 23Rentsch D. Hirner B. Schmelzer E. Frommer W.B. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1437-1446Google Scholar). These genes can be classified into different families (24Fischer W.N. André B. Rentsch D. Krolkiewicz S. Tegeder M. Breit Kreuz K. Frommer W.B. Trends Plant Sci. 1998; 3: 188-195Google Scholar, 25Wipf D. Ludewig U. Tegeder M. Rentsch D. Koch W. Frommer W.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 139-147Google Scholar). The ATF1 superfamily (amino acid transporter family 1) consists of several subfamilies: the AAPs (amino acid permeases), the LHTs (lysine histidine transporters), the ProTs (proline and compatible solutes transporters), the AUXs (putative auxin transporter) and several new subfamilies (25Wipf D. Ludewig U. Tegeder M. Rentsch D. Koch W. Frommer W.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 139-147Google Scholar). One transporter, ANT1, of this new subfamily has been characterized recently as a transporter for neutral and aromatic amino acids (26Chen L. Ortiz-Lopez A. Jung A. Bush D.R. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 1813-1820Google Scholar). The CAT subfamily (cationic amino acid transporters) is a member of the second plant amino acid transporter family, namely the APC-superfamily (24Fischer W.N. André B. Rentsch D. Krolkiewicz S. Tegeder M. Breit Kreuz K. Frommer W.B. Trends Plant Sci. 1998; 3: 188-195Google Scholar, 27Frommer W.B. Hummel S. Unseld M. Ninnemann O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12036-12040Google Scholar). Within the complete Arabidopsis genome, eight related sequences belonging to the AAP family can be identified. Six of these eight genes have been characterized as functional transporters so far. AAP1–5 were shown to mediate transport of a broad spectrum of amino acids with low selectivity by a proton-coupled mechanism (14Fischer W.N. Loo D.D.F. Koch W. Ludewig U. Boorer K.J. Tegeder M. Rentsch D. Wright E.M. Frommer W.B. Plant J. 2002; 29: 1-18Google Scholar, 22Fischer W.N. Kwart M. Hummel S. Frommer W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16315-16320Google Scholar, 28Boorer K.J. Frommer W.B. Bush D.R. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2213-2220Google Scholar,29Boorer K.J. Fischer W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13040-13046Google Scholar). For glutamine, glutamate, and asparagine as major transport forms of organic nitrogen, these transporters have K mvalues that are in a physiological range with respect to the concentrations of these amino acids found in the phloem and xylem. Aspartate is transported by most AAPs with an extremely low affinity and efficiency. Only AAP6 has a K m value for aspartate that is in a physiological range (14Fischer W.N. Loo D.D.F. Koch W. Ludewig U. Boorer K.J. Tegeder M. Rentsch D. Wright E.M. Frommer W.B. Plant J. 2002; 29: 1-18Google Scholar). The described properties of AAPs thus match the activities expected for transport proteins involved in moving a wide spectrum of amino acids into the phloem sap and are consistent with the properties described for uptake kinetics measured in plasma membrane vesicles of leaves (17Li Z. Bush D.R. Plant Physiol. 1990; 94: 268-277Google Scholar). Despite the well described biochemical properties, information about tissue- and cell-specific expression of these genes is not well established. A third member of the AAP family expressed in young seeds and veins of the siliques was isolated and functionally characterized. Although most closely related to AAP1 on a protein level and found in duplicated regions on chromosome I, it is the high affinity of AAP8 toward aspartate that characterizes this protein as a high affinity transporter for acidic amino acids. This transporter expressed in young seeds and veins of siliques shows a fine-tuned expression pattern. With its biochemical properties it can complete the needs to adapt to various substrates during seed development. AAP6 as a high affinity transporter was localized to the xylem parenchyma cells, fulfilling both expression pattern and biochemical properties of the described physiological predictions for xylem-to-phloem transfer of amino acids. Arabidopsis thaliana L. ecotype Col-0 was grown either in axenic culture on MS medium (30Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-479Google Scholar) supplemented with 2% sucrose or cultured in soil in the greenhouse. Arabidopsisplants were transformed using Agrobacterium tumefacienspGV2260 under vacuum infiltration as described in Ref. 31Bechtold N. Pelletier G. Mol. Biol. 1993; 82: 259-266Google Scholar. AAP7 was amplified by PCR on the Minet cDNA library (32Minet M. Dufour M.E. Lacroute F. Plant J. 1992; 2: 417-422Google Scholar), (5′-atggacattaaa gaagatgacgagtctcg, 5′-tcatccgaatttagctccaacaagtcc, both primers with additionalBamH1 sites), cloned in pBlueScript SK+ cut withNotI and Bsp120I, and subcloned in pFL61. AAP8 was amplified by RT-PCR 1The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcription; GUS, β-glucuronidase; AuxRE, auxin response elements. with RNA extracted from roots (5′-atgatggacgcatacaacaatccc, 5′-ctagtctaaattcttgaagggc) and cloned between the EcoRI sites of PCR2.1 (Invitrogen), excised with EcoRI, and subcloned in pSK+. Subsequently the insert was excised with NotI and Bsp120I and cloned in the expression vector pFL61. The promoters of AAP6, AAP7, and AAP8 were amplified by PCR using Arabidopsis thaliana L. ecotype Col-0 genomic DNA as template. The AAP8 promoter region as two fragments, which correspond to position −2.5 to –1.0 kb and –1.0 kb to ATG. The primers used were 5′-cgtctttggtgtctccgtaggcg and 5′-gcccatcccaattgtcgagacag, 5′-gctgttcatagtcaggtaggagg and 5′-cccccgagggattgttgtatgcg. The amplified fragments were fused by using a native HincII site in the overlapping region and cloned into pGUS7 2W. N. Fischer and W. B. Frommer, unpublished data. to create the translational fusion with the uidA gene. The AAP8 promoter-GUS fusion was excised from pGUS7 and cloned into the plant binary vector pGPTV-BAR (33Becker D. Kemper E. Schell J. Masterson R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 20: 1195-1197Google Scholar). The 2.5-kb promoter region of AAP6 was isolated and amplified as two PCR fragments that have overlapping sequences including a native SalI site. A BamHI site was introduced after the starting ATG to allow translational fusion of the fragment with the uidA gene. Primers used were: 5′-gctgaatgctgttattaatttgtgtcgc, 5′-gagagtcgaccaattacaaagcccg and 5′-cgggctttgtaattggtcgactctc, 5′-gagagagaggatccgtcgcggccatcctcg. Each fragment was cloned into pBlueScript SK+ and sequenced. The two fragments were fused withSalI site, cloned in the BamHI site of pGUS7. The cassette including the AAP6 promoter, uidA gene, and nopalin synthase terminator was excised by EcoRI and cloned into the EcoRI site of the plant binary vector pCB302 (34Xiang C. Han P. Lutziger I. Wang K. Oliver D.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 717Google Scholar). The 1.5-kb of the AAP7 promoter region was amplified by PCR using primer 5′-tcggttggtgttataactcgagactcg and 5′-ggcatgtcatctaggggccaaaatctg. The fragment was cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), sequenced, and fused translationally with theuidA gene in pGUS9. 3T. Martin, unpublished result. The AAP7 promoter anduidA gene were excised with XbaI andSacI and cloned into the XbaI/SacI site of the plant binary vector pGPTV-Bar (33Becker D. Kemper E. Schell J. Masterson R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 20: 1195-1197Google Scholar). Histochemical assays for β-glucuronidase activity were performed as described in Ref. 35Martin T. Wöhner R.V. Hummel S. Willmitzer L. Frommer W.B. Gallagher S.R. GUS Protocols: Using the GUS Gene as a Reporter of Gene Expression. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1992: 23-43Google Scholar). Tissues were cut into 2 × 5-mm pieces, incubated in GUS staining solution containing 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7), 10 mm EDTA, 3 mmK4(Fe(CN)6), 0.5 mmK3(Fe(CN)6), 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2 mm 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-glucuronic acid (X-Gluc) for 3–24 h at 37 °C. Slight vacuum was applied to facilitate substrate infiltration. For the fresh sections, tissues were embedded in 5% low melting agarose in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). After solidification fresh sections (75–150 μm) were made with razor blades using a vibratome (Leica, Bensheim, Germany). Sections were collected in ice-cold water and incubated in GUS staining solution described as above, but without 0.5 mm K3(Fe(CN)6). For chlorophyll containing tissues, fresh sections were cleared in 70% EtOH. The yeast strain 22Δ8AA (14Fischer W.N. Loo D.D.F. Koch W. Ludewig U. Boorer K.J. Tegeder M. Rentsch D. Wright E.M. Frommer W.B. Plant J. 2002; 29: 1-18Google Scholar) was transformed with cDNA of AAP1, AAP5, AAP6, AAP7, AAP8 and the empty vector pFL61 according to Dohmen et al. (36Dohmen R.J. Strasser A.W.M. Honer C.B. Hollenberg C.P. Yeast. 1991; 7: 691-692Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on media without uracil supplemented with 0.5 g/liter ammonium sulfate. Growth assays were performed on media lacking uracil with aspartate, glutamate, proline, or citrulline as sole nitrogen source at concentrations of 1, 3, and 6 mm. All experiments were repeated three times with independent colonies. Yeast cells were grown to logarithmic phase harvested at A 600 = 0.5, washed, and resuspended in ice cold buffer (50 mmNaPi, pH 4.5, 0.6 m sorbitol) to a finalA 600 = 5. Cells were preincubated with 10 μl of 1 m glucose (30 °C, 5 min). Then 110 μl of buffer, labeled l-[14C]aspartate (7.4 GBq/mmol,Amersham Biosciences), and unlabelled aspartate of the desired concentration was added. Linear uptake rates were determined over 4 min. Samples were removed after 20, 60, 120, and 240 s, transferred to 4 ml of ice-cold buffer, filtered on glass fiber filters, and washed twice with 4 ml of buffer. Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Endogenous uptake activity of yeast transformed with empty vector pFL61 was subtracted as background activity. Transport measurements were repeated independently and represent the mean of six experiments. Competition experiments were performed with a concentration of 450 μm aspartate and a 10-fold excess of respective amino acids according to Fischer et al. (22Fischer W.N. Kwart M. Hummel S. Frommer W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16315-16320Google Scholar) Data base searches revealed that theArabidopsis genome contains eight members of the AAP family. To obtain the full complement of all eight genes fromArabidopsis, the remaining two cDNAs of AAP7 and AAP8 were cloned by RT-PCR. The identity of the PCR fragments was verified by sequencing and data base comparison with the annotated sequence (accession numbers AtAAP8, AAC34329; AtAAP7, BAB10054). The cDNAs code for proteins with 476 (AAP8) and 467 amino acids (AAP7), with a molecular mass of 52 kDa and 51.7 kDa, respectively. The closest homologs of AAP8 are AAP1 with 75% identity and AAP6 with about 70% identity on protein level, whereas AAP7 is the most distant member in this group (TableI, Fig. 1). AAP1, -6 and -8 form one of the three branches in the phylogenetic tree of the eight AAPs (Fig. 1). Using transmembrane prediction programs (THMM; www.CBS.dk) the proteins are likely to have 9–10 transmembrane domains with the N terminus predicted to be cytosolic and the C terminus predicted to be outside (Fig.2 D, AAP8). The overall predicted structure is in agreement with the biochemical characterization of the topology of AAP1/NAT2 (37Chang H.C. Bush D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30552-30557Google Scholar) and predictions for other AAPs (25Wipf D. Ludewig U. Tegeder M. Rentsch D. Koch W. Frommer W.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 139-147Google Scholar). The genomic sequence of AAP8 contains six exons and five introns, an exon-intron structure very similar to that of AAP1 (Fig. 2 A). AAP6 also contains five introns in the coding sequence, but the location of the introns is different to AAP1 and AAP8. AAP7 contains seven exons and six introns and is located on chromosome 5. AAP1 and AAP8 are both located on chromosome I in duplicated regions (Fig. 2 C). To analyze whether potential duplication of AAP1 and AAP8 points to a redundant function, biochemical properties and expression pattern of AAP8 and AAP7 were analyzed and compared with related proteins.Table IIdentities (%) and positives (% based on BLOSUM62 matrix) (55Henikoff S.

Dufour M.E. Lacroute F. Plant J. 1992; 2: 417-422Google Scholar). Yeast transformed with empty vector (C1) was used as control. 22Δ8AA is unable to utilize arginine, aspartate, citrulline, γ-aminobutyric acid, glutamate, or proline as sole nitrogen sources. AAP1 and AAP6 in pFL61 were used for comparison since they are most closely related to AAP8 on protein level. AAP5 was included due to the higher affinity toward basic amino acids (14Fischer W.N. Loo D.D.F. Koch W. Ludewig U. Boorer K.J. Tegeder M. Rentsch D. Wright E.M. Frommer W.B. Plant J. 2002; 29: 1-18Google Scholar). On media containing 1 and 3 mmarginine, citrulline, glutamate, or proline as sole nitrogen sources, respectively, cells expressing either of the AAPs were able to grow, except AAP7 (Fig. 3). Cells transformed with the control plasmids (C1) grew only on 6 mm aspartate, glutamate, and arginine containing media. AAP7 was nonfunctional, whereas yeast cells expressing AAP8 mediated high capacity transport of the respective amino acids. On media with aspartate as a sole nitrogen source only yeast transformed with AAP8 and AAP6 showed significant growth. Within 4 days, neither of the AAPs mediated sufficient aspartate transport to enable growth on 1 mm aspartate; however, after 4 days, AAP8-expressing cells formed small colonies. After 7 days of growth on 1 mm aspartate, cells transformed with AAP6 also formed small colonies, whereas on 3 mmaspartate only cells expressing AAP8 and -6 could grow. Direct l-[14C] aspartate uptake was determined at a 10-fold excess of all proteinogenic amino acids. Strongest competitors for aspartate uptake were proline, alanine, and methionine (Fig. 4). In principal most amino acids were good competitors with the exception of the basic amino acids arginine, histidine, and lysine. The selectivity of the competition experiments is in agreement with previous studies showing that the basic amino acids are recognized only by AAP3 and AAP5 inin vivo competition experiments (14Fischer W.N. Loo D.D.F. Koch W. Ludewig U. Boorer K.J. Tegeder M. Rentsch D. Wright E.M. Frommer W.B. Plant J. 2002; 29: 1-18Google Scholar). Thus AAP8 can be classified as a general amino acid permease and, when expressed in yeast, mediates a higher transport capacity for aspartate as compared with the other AAPs. AAP7 is the most distantly related member of the AAP family, a group of well characterized amino acid transporters within the ATF1 superfamily (25Wipf D. Ludewig U. Tegeder M. Rentsch D. Koch W. Frommer W.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 139-147Google Scholar). However AAP7 did not mediate growth on aspartate, glutamate, proline, arginine, or citrulline (Fig. 3). The inability to complement any of the mutant phenotypes may be due to poor targeting to the yeast plasma membrane, an altered substrate spectrum as in the case of the related putative auxin transporter AUX1 (38Marchant A. Bhalerao R. Casimiro I. Eklof J. Casero P.J. Bennett M. Sandberg G. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 589-597Google Scholar), or lost functionality. In addition expression was not detectable on RNA gel blots and with promoter GUS studies so far. So far AAP6 was the transporter with the highestK m value for aspartate. Screenings for a transporter specific for acidic amino acids by heterologous complementation of a glutamate- and aspartate-deficient yeast strain with an expression cDNA library from Arabidopsis resulted only in the identification of AAP6 (14Fischer W.N. Loo D.D.F. Koch W. Ludewig U. Boorer K.J. Tegeder M. Rentsch D. Wright E.M. Frommer W.B. Plant J. 2002; 29: 1-18Google Scholar). For direct comparability, the kinetic properties of AAP1, AAP6, and AAP8 were determined in uptake experiments (Fig. 5). TheK m value of AAP 8 for aspartate was ∼444 μm, for AAP1 ∼774 μm, and for AAP6 ∼248 μm. The V max of AAP8 was 1.7 nmol of asp−1 · mg of protein−1 and about 6-fold higher than the value obtained for AAP6 (0.342 nmol of asp−1 · mg of protein−1). Among the previously analyzed AAPs, AAP6 had the highest affinity for aspartate when determined in oocytes (1.6 mm) (14Fischer W.N. Loo D.D.F. Koch W. Ludewig U. Boorer K.J. Tegeder M. Rentsch D. Wright E.M. Frommer W.B. Plant J. 2002; 29: 1-18Google Scholar) which is consistent with the yeast uptake experiments. The K mvalues obtained from the yeast uptake experiments differ form the values obtained in oocytes (14Fischer W.N. Loo D.D.F. Koch W. Ludewig U. Boorer K.J. Tegeder M. Rentsch D. Wright E.M. Frommer W.B. Plant J. 2002; 29: 1-18Google Scholar). Electrophysiological data showed that apparent affinities for amino acids were sensitive to pH changes and the net charge of the substrate. Nevertheless AAP8 has aK m value for aspartate in between AAP6 and AAP1 and the highest V max when compared in the same heterologous system. The better growth in the yeast experiments can be explained by the higher transport capacity. AAP1, the closest homologue to AAP8, had the lowest affinity for aspartate with aK m value of 774 μm in agreement with the yeast growth assays. The genomic sequence corresponding to 2.5 kb upstream of the ATG of AAP8 was analyzed in silico for cis-acting elements using the PLACE data base (plant cis-acting regulatory elements) (39Higo K"
https://openalex.org/W2046899903,"STAT3 is a member of a family of transcription factors with Src homology 2 (SH2) domains that are activated by tyrosine phosphorylation in response to a wide variety of cytokines and growth factors. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of STAT3 activation by the Src family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, which have been linked to STAT activation in both normal and transformed cell types. Using Sf-9 insect cells, we demonstrate direct STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation and stimulation of DNA binding activity by five members of the Src kinase family (Src, Hck, Lyn, Fyn, and Fgr). We also observed stable STAT3·Src family kinase complex formation in this system. Recombinant Src family kinase SH3 domains were sufficient for interaction with STAT3, suggesting a mechanistic basis for the Src kinase-STAT3 interaction. To test the contribution of Src family kinase SH3 domains to the recruitment and activation of STAT3 in vivo, we used Rat-2 fibroblasts expressing activated mutants of the myeloid Src family member Hck. Transformation of fibroblasts by an activated Hck mutant lacking the negative regulatory tail tyrosine residue (Hck-YF) induced strong DNA binding activity of endogenous STAT3. Inactivation of Hck SH3 function by Ala replacement of a conserved Trp residue (W93A mutant) completely abolished STAT3 activation by Hck-YF and reduced transforming activity by 50% without affecting Hck kinase activity. Finally, overexpression of STAT3 in Rat-2 cells transiently stimulated Hck and c-Src kinase activity in the absence of extracellular signals, an effect that was dependent upon a putative SH3 binding motif in STAT3. These results support a model in which Src family kinases recruit STAT3 through an SH3-dependent mechanism, resulting in transient kinase activation and STAT3 phosphorylation.

SH2, and kinase domains, followed by a short C-terminal tail region containing a conserved tyrosine phosphorylation site. Recent structural analyses of c-Src and Hck demonstrate that the SH2 and SH3 domains contribute to the negative regulation of kinase activity through intramolecular interactions (12Williams J.C.

The SH2 domain binds to the negative regulatory tail, an interaction that is dependent upon prior phosphorylation by the Src tail kinase, Csk (17Nada S. Okada M. MacAuley A. Cooper J.A. Nakagawa H. Nature. 1991; 351: 69-72Google Scholar). The importance of tail-SH2 interaction to negative regulation is illustrated by the constitutive tyrosine kinase and transforming activities of the v-Src oncogene, which lacks C-terminal tail residues including the conserved tyrosine. The crystal structures also revealed intramolecular contacts between the SH3 domain and a polyproline type II helix formed by the linker connecting the SH2 domain with the N-terminal lobe of the kinase domain. Point mutations of linker prolines as well as some SH3 mutations can also release kinase activity and induce a transformed phenotype in fibroblasts, providing evidence for an essential role of this SH3-mediated interaction to overall regulation of kinase activity (18Briggs S.D. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26579-26583Google Scholar, 19Gonfloni S. Williams J.C. Hattula K. Weijland A. Wierenga R.K. Superti-Furga G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7261-7271Google Scholar). Together, these SH2 and SH3-mediated interactions work through an allosteric mechanism to push the two lobes of the kinase domain together, thus preventing substrate binding and stabilizing the inactive form of the kinase domain.The crystal structures of the down-regulated forms of Src family kinases suggest that physiological protein-protein interactions through these domains may induce transient kinase activation, leading to substrate phosphorylation. In this report, we investigated the SH3-dependent interaction of the STAT3 transcription factor with Src family kinases in vitro and in vivo. STATs are latent cytoplasmic transcription factors that become activated by tyrosine phosphorylation, which induces STAT dimerization, nuclear translocation, and transcriptional regulation (20Ihle J.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 211-217Google Scholar, 21Horvath C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 496-502Google Scholar). A growing body of evidence strongly supports the idea that STATs are substrates for Src family kinases, particularly STAT3 (22Reddy E.P. Korapati A. Chaturvedi P. Rane S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2532-2547Google Scholar). For example, transformation of rodent fibroblasts with constitutively activated Src kinases results in strong activation of STAT3, and activation appears to be essential for transformation (23Turkson J. Bowman T.L. Garcia R. Caldenhoven E. de Groot R.P. Jove R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2545-2552Google Scholar, 24Yu C.-L. Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S. Larner A.C. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Jove R.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2553-2558Google Scholar). Here we show that STAT3 is a direct substrate for all members of the Src kinase family tested and that the SH3 domains of Src kinases are sufficient for STAT3 binding in vitro. Disruption of the SH3 domain of an activated Hck mutant causes a complete loss of STAT3 activation in fibroblasts, indicating a necessary role for Src family kinase SH3 domains in the recognition of STAT3 by Src kinases in vivo. In addition, we show that interaction with STAT3 induces a transient increase in Src kinase activity. Together these results suggest a model in which STAT3 is recruited to Src family kinases via an SH3-dependent mechanism, leading to transient kinase activation and STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation. SH3-dependent substrate recruitment is sufficient to induce Src activation without dephosphorylation of the negative regulatory tail, allowing Src family kinases to return to the inactive state after release of phosphorylated STAT3.DISCUSSIONSTATs are latent cytoplasmic transcription factors that require tyrosine phosphorylation for their dimerization and activation (21Horvath C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 496-502Google Scholar). Many families of both receptor and nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases have been implicated in STAT activation (47Smithgall T.E. Briggs S.D. Schreiner S. Lerner E.C. Cheng H. Wilson M.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2612-2618Google Scholar). In this report, we focused on the molecular mechanisms of Src family kinase interaction with STAT3. A growing body of evidence has implicated the Src kinase family in STAT3 activation, both in normal and transformed cell types (23Turkson J. Bowman T.L. Garcia R. Caldenhoven E. de Groot R.P. Jove R.

This has led to the questions of whether STAT3 is a target for all members of the Src kinase family and whether Src kinases phosphorylate STAT3 directly. Using the baculovirus/Sf-9 insect cell system, we demonstrate that STAT3 is a substrate for a variety of Src family members, including Hck, Fyn, Lyn, and Fgr in addition to c-Src itself. We also observed that STAT3 stably associates with Src family kinases in this system, supporting a direct relationship between these signaling proteins in vivo.Although these results suggest that Src family kinases have the potential to associate directly with STAT3 under physiological conditions, recent work indicates that other kinases may participate in the activation mechanism in mammalian cells. Using kinase-selective pharmacological inhibitors, Zhang et al. (41Zhang Y. Turkson J. Carter-Su C. Smithgall T. Levitzki A. Kraker A. Krolewski J.J. Medveczky P. Jove R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24935-24944Google Scholar) have shown that Src and Jak2 may cooperate in the activation of STAT3 in v-Src-transformed fibroblasts. Their model suggests an essential role for Jak2 in the recruitment of STAT3 to a growth factor receptor such as the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, followed by Src-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3. Using a related approach, Wanget al. (49Wang Y.Z. Wharton W. Garcia R. Kraker A. Jove R. Pledger W.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2075-2085Google Scholar) established that STAT3 activation by platelet-derived growth factor also requires c-Src. In both cases, Src is proposed as the kinase responsible for the STAT3 phosphorylation event. Our data suggest that simultaneous recruitment of STAT3 and Src to the platelet-derived growth factor receptor and possibly other growth factor and cytokine receptors may promote Src-STAT3 interaction through the SH3-dependent mechanism identified here.Immunoblot analysis with phosphospecific antibodies shows that all Src family members recognize the STAT3 tyrosine residue essential for dimerization and activation (Tyr-705) (54Becker S. Groner B. Muller C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 145-151Google Scholar). Using a STAT3 mutant that lacks Tyr-705 (STAT3YF), we investigated whether any additional sites of tyrosine phosphorylation were present in STAT3. Unexpectedly, Hck and Src were able to phosphorylate STAT3YF, suggesting the presence of phosphorylation sites in addition to Tyr-705. Although the DNA binding of STAT3YF was not detectable upon coexpression with Hck or Src, these additional phosphorylation sites may be required for other STAT3 functions such as the recruitment of proteins with SH2 domains to form a signaling complex. An adaptor function for STAT3 has been described for interferon receptor signaling. In this case, tyrosine phosphorylation of interferon receptor-bound STAT3 created a docking site for the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase via its SH2 domain (55Pfeffer L.M. Mullersman J.E. Pfeffer S.R. Murti A. Shi W. Yang C.H. Science. 1997; 276: 1418-1420Google Scholar). Whether or not the secondary sites for Src and Hck are phosphorylated under physiological conditions and their contribution to the Src-STAT3 signaling pathway will require further investigation.Several previous reports have demonstrated interactions between Src family kinases and STAT3 (25Cao X.M. Tay A. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1595-1603Google Scholar, 42Chaturvedi P. Reddy M.V.R. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1749-1758Google Scholar), and work presented here supports a direct association between these proteins. In addition, we show for the first time that Src kinase SH3 domains are sufficient to bind STAT3in vitro, suggesting a mechanism for Src-STAT3 interactionin vivo. Strong support for this hypothesis is provided by studies of an active mutant of Hck (Hck-YF) in which SH3 function was ablated by replacing a conserved tryptophan residue with alanine (W93A). Previous studies have shown that substitution of this conserved Trp residue inactivates SH3 function both in Hck and Lck (44Hassaine G. Courcoul M. Bessou G. Barthalay Y. Picard C. Olive D. Collette Y. Vigne R. Decroly E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16885-16893Google Scholar, 56Denny M.F. Kaufman H.C. Chan A.C. Straus D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5146-5152Google Scholar). The Hck W93A mutation completely blocked STAT3 activation by Hck-YF in fibroblasts without affecting kinase autophosphorylation or tyrosine phosphorylation of the endogenous substrate protein, p40. In a related experiment, we found that the W93A mutation released the Hck kinase domain from negative regulation in vivo, yet this mutant was also unable to recruit and activate STAT3. Together, these findings provide a compelling argument for the SH3-dependent recruitment and activation of STAT3 by Hck and other Src family kinases, at least in this model system. An activating effect of Src family kinase SH3 domain mutations has also been reported for c-Src and Lck (57Veillette A. Caron L. Fournel M. Pawson T. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 971-980Google Scholar, 58Reynolds P.J. Hurley T.R. Sefton B.M. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1949-1955Google Scholar, 59Seidel-Dugan C. Meyer B.E. Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1835-1845Google Scholar). Whether or not these mutations also affect STAT3 recruitment and phosphorylation has not been reported.Previous studies have established that STAT3 activation is important for fibroblast transformation by activated mutants of Src. Constitutive STAT3 activation and STAT3·Src complex formation is readily detected in Src-transformed fibroblasts (24Yu C.-L. Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S. Larner A.C. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Jove R. Science. 1995; 269: 81-83Google Scholar, 25Cao X.M. Tay A. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1595-1603Google Scholar, 52Garcia R. Yu C.-L. Hudnall A. Catlett R. Nelson K. Smithgall T.E. Fujita D.J. Ethier S. Jove R. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 8: 1267-1276Google Scholar). More recent studies have shown that STAT3 activation may be required for Src-induced transformation (23Turkson J. Bowman T.L. Garcia R. Caldenhoven E. de Groot R.P. Jove R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2545-2552Google Scholar, 26Bromberg J.F. Horvath C.M. Besser D. Lathem W.W. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2553-2558Google Scholar). These experiments used dominant negative forms of STAT3, which were found to block Src-mediated transformation of fibroblasts. Although our data suggest that STAT3 activation is required for maximal transformation by Hck-YF, uncoupling Hck-YF from STAT3 activation through SH3 mutation reduced but did not eliminate transforming activity (Fig. 7). This finding suggests that STAT3 is important but not absolutely required for fibroblast transformation by Hck-YF.The finding that the W93A SH3 mutation was able to release Hck from negative regulation in vivo provides further evidence for a dominant role for the SH3 domain in the negative regulation of Hck. The crystal structures of Hck and Src show that the SH3 domain engages the SH2-kinase linker and that this interaction helps to maintain the kinase in the inactive conformation (see the Introduction). Binding of proteins to the SH3 domain, which induces SH3-linker displacement, and mutagenesis of the linker prolines essential for intramolecular SH3 binding both lead to constitutive Hck activation and fibroblast transformation, even in the presence of tail phosphorylation and SH2 engagement (33Lerner E.C. Smithgall T.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 365-369Google Scholar). Work presented here shows that mutagenesis of SH3 also promotes constitutive Hck autophosphorylation in vivo, presumably by releasing the negative regulatory interaction with the SH2-kinase linker (Fig. 6). However, this mutant shows substantially lower transforming activity compared with the Hck SH2-kinase linker mutant (18Briggs S.D. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26579-26583Google Scholar), presumably because it is uncoupled from STAT3 activation and possibly other SH3-dependent transforming pathways downstream.Data presented here support an SH3-dependent mechanism for STAT3 recruitment in vivo. Because previous studies have shown that SH3 engagement can induce Src family kinase activation, we tested whether STAT3 overexpression affected Src family kinase activity in fibroblasts. Wild-type STAT3 caused a transient activation of c-Src and Hck, whereas a STAT3 mutant lacking a consensus SH3 binding motif showed a markedly reduced effect (STAT3–2PA; Fig. 8). Despite the reduced impact of STAT3–2PA on Src and Hck activity in fibroblasts, this mutant still associated with Hck in the Sf-9 cell coexpression system (data not shown). These results suggest that Src family kinases associate with STATs in a complex manner involving more than one interacting surface, but that the PXXP motif shown in Fig. 8is required for the observed effects on kinase activity. Kinase activation has been reported after association of other proteins with Src family kinase SH3 domains, including HIV-1 Nef (18Briggs S.D. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26579-26583Google Scholar, 33Lerner E.C. Smithgall T.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 365-369Google Scholar, 34Briggs S.D. Sharkey M. Stevenson M. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17899-17902Google Scholar), the focal adhesion protein p130 Cas (60Burnham M.R. Bruce-Staskal P.J. Harte M.T. Weidow C.L. Ma A. Weed S.A. Bouton A.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5865-5878Google Scholar, 61Pellicena P. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28190-28196Google Scholar), and the progesterone receptor (62Boonyaratanakornkit V. Scott M.P. Ribon V. Sherman L. Anderson S.M. Maller J.L. Miller W.T. Edwards D.P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 269-280Google Scholar). These results support a general model in which SH3-dependent recruitment of substrates may induce transient activation of Src family kinases through a linker displacement mechanism (63Pellicena P. Miller W.T. Front Biosci. 2002; 7: d256-d267Google Scholar). In the case of STAT3, phosphorylation induces release from the kinase, dimerization, and nuclear translocation. Once STAT3 is released from SH3, the kinase may return to the inactive state by re-establishing the SH3-linker interaction. Such a model suggests that local concentrations of STAT3 may control the activity of Src kinases. Thus, recruitment of STAT3 to cytokine or growth factor receptors may induce the transient activation of receptor-associated Src family kinases through their SH3 domains, leading to STAT activation. The Src family of protein-tyrosine kinases regulates a diverse array of cellular processes in both normal and transformed cells, including proliferation, survival, differentiation, adhesion, and motility (1Lowell C.A.

SH2, and kinase domains, followed by a short C-terminal tail region containing a conserved tyrosine phosphorylation site. Recent structural analyses of c-Src and Hck demonstrate that the SH2 and SH3 domains contribute to the negative regulation of kinase activity through intramolecular interactions (12Williams J.C.

The SH2 domain binds to the negative regulatory tail, an interaction that is dependent upon prior phosphorylation by the Src tail kinase, Csk (17Nada S. Okada M. MacAuley A. Cooper J.A. Nakagawa H. Nature. 1991; 351: 69-72Google Scholar). The importance of tail-SH2 interaction to negative regulation is illustrated by the constitutive tyrosine kinase and transforming activities of the v-Src oncogene, which lacks C-terminal tail residues including the conserved tyrosine. The crystal structures also revealed intramolecular contacts between the SH3 domain and a polyproline type II helix formed by the linker connecting the SH2 domain with the N-terminal lobe of the kinase domain. Point mutations of linker prolines as well as some SH3 mutations can also release kinase activity and induce a transformed phenotype in fibroblasts, providing evidence for an essential role of this SH3-mediated interaction to overall regulation of kinase activity (18Briggs S.D. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26579-26583Google Scholar, 19Gonfloni S. Williams J.C. Hattula K. Weijland A. Wierenga R.K. Superti-Furga G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7261-7271Google Scholar). Together, these SH2 and SH3-mediated interactions work through an allosteric mechanism to push the two lobes of the kinase domain together, thus preventing substrate binding and stabilizing the inactive form of the kinase domain. The crystal structures of the down-regulated forms of Src family kinases suggest that physiological protein-protein interactions through these domains may induce transient kinase activation, leading to substrate phosphorylation. In this report, we investigated the SH3-dependent interaction of the STAT3 transcription factor with Src family kinases in vitro and in vivo. STATs are latent cytoplasmic transcription factors that become activated by tyrosine phosphorylation, which induces STAT dimerization, nuclear translocation, and transcriptional regulation (20Ihle J.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 211-217Google Scholar, 21Horvath C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 496-502Google Scholar). A growing body of evidence strongly supports the idea that STATs are substrates for Src family kinases, particularly STAT3 (22Reddy E.P. Korapati A. Chaturvedi P. Rane S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2532-2547Google Scholar). For example, transformation of rodent fibroblasts with constitutively activated Src kinases results in strong activation of STAT3, and activation appears to be essential for transformation (23Turkson J.

https://openalex.org/W1574150623,"Proinflammatory activation of NF-kappaB requires an upstream kinase complex (IkappaB-kinase; IKK) composed of two catalytic subunits (IKKalpha and IKKbeta) and a noncatalytic regulatory component named NEMO (NF-kappaB essential modulator). NEMO interacts with a COOH-terminal sequence within both IKKs termed the NEMO-binding domain (NBD), and a cell-permeable NBD peptide blocks NEMO/IKKbeta interactions and inhibits tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced NF-kappaB. We report here that a peptide encompassing the NBD not only blocked association of both IKKs with NEMO but also disrupted preformed NEMO/IKK complexes in vitro. Furthermore, peptide blocking and alanine-scanning mutation studies revealed differences between the NBDs of IKKalpha and IKKbeta, and mutational analysis of the IKKbeta NBD identified the physical properties required at each position to maintain association with NEMO. Finally, we demonstrate that loss of NEMO-binding by IKKbeta through deletion of the NBD renders it catalytically active and that potential phosphorylation within the IKKbeta NBD may serve as a signal to down-regulate IKK activity. Our findings therefore provide critical insight into the physical properties of the NBD that will be valuable for the design of drugs aimed at disrupting the IKK complex and also reveal potential regulatory mechanisms controlling the function of the IKK complex."

We conclude that hypoxia induces ATP release from endothelial cells and fibroblasts and that the activation of P2 purinoceptors is involved in the regulation of DNA synthesis by fibroblasts under hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia has been shown to act as a direct proliferative stimulus for fibroblasts in a variety of organs. This capability of fibroblasts is unusual, at least among mesenchymally derived cells, and appears to be important in normal development, wound healing, and fibrosis as well as in the vascular changes that characterize hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (1Stenmartk K.R. Mecham R.P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 89-144Google Scholar, 2Torry D.J. Richards C.D. Podor T.J. Gauldie J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1525-1532Google Scholar, 3Davidson J.D. Mustoe T.A. Wound Repair Regen. 2001; 9: 175-179Google Scholar). With regard to pulmonary artery adventitial fibroblasts, we have shown that among the resident vascular wall cells they exhibit the earliest and most dramatic responses to hypoxic exposure in vivo (4Belknap J.K. Orton E.C. Ensley B. Tucker A. Stenmark K.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 16: 366-371Google Scholar). In tissue culture we have also demonstrated that hypoxia in the absence of exogenous mitogens induces proliferation of pulmonary artery fibroblasts as well as some subpopulations of aortic adventitial fibroblasts. This response is due in large part to Gαi/o-mediated activation of a complex network of mitogen-activated protein kinases, whose specific contributions to hypoxia-induced proliferation differ from those of serum-induced growth signals (5Das M. Bouchey D.M. Moore M.J. Hopkins D.C. Nemenoff R.A. Stenmark K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15631-15640Google Scholar). It remains unclear, however, whether either activation or augmentation of the hypoxia-induced growth response is due at least in part to autocrine/paracrine responses to factors secreted by fibroblasts during hypoxia, which act through G-protein-coupled pathways. One factor that could contribute to such an autocrine loop is ATP. Purines and pyrimidines (mainly ATP, ADP, adenosine, and UTP) have widespread and specific extracellular signaling actions in the regulation of a variety of functions in many tissues and appear to have key roles in development, proliferation, differentiation, and release of hormones, neurotransmitters, and cytokines (6Gordon J.L. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 309-319Google Scholar, 7Dubyak G.R. El-Moatassim C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C577-C606Google Scholar, 8Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol.

It is also becoming evident that alterations in the physiology of purinergic signaling may result in the development of a variety of pathologies including disorders of the immune system, neurodegenerative, and vascular diseases (7Dubyak G.R. El-Moatassim C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C577-C606Google Scholar). Extracellular ATP can, in fact, stimulate the growth and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC), 1The abbreviations used are: SMC, smooth muscle cells; ADPβS, adenosine 5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate); AMP-CPP, adenosine 5′-(α,β-methylene)triphosphate; ARL67156, 6-N,N-diethyl-β-γ-dibromomethylene-d-adenosine 5′-triphosphate; BzATP, benzoylbenzoyl-ATP, 2′-3′-O-(4-benzoilbenzoil) adenosine 5′-triphosphate; MeSATP, 2-methylthioadenosine triphosphate; PPADS, pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2′-4′-disulfonic acid; Egr-1, early growth response-1 transcription factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PTx, pertussis toxin; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility supershift assay.1The abbreviations used are: SMC, smooth muscle cells; ADPβS, adenosine 5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate); AMP-CPP, adenosine 5′-(α,β-methylene)triphosphate; ARL67156, 6-N,N-diethyl-β-γ-dibromomethylene-d-adenosine 5′-triphosphate; BzATP, benzoylbenzoyl-ATP, 2′-3′-O-(4-benzoilbenzoil) adenosine 5′-triphosphate; MeSATP, 2-methylthioadenosine triphosphate; PPADS, pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2′-4′-disulfonic acid; Egr-1, early growth response-1 transcription factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PTx, pertussis toxin; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility supershift assay. and this response may play an important role in a variety of vascular diseases (10Erlinge D.

Pharmacol. 2002; 135: 831-842Google Scholar). Importantly, in addition to nerves and circulating blood cells, vascular cells themselves appear to be a potent source of ATP and other adenine nucleotides as these products are known to be released into the extracellular milieu in response to many vascular stress conditions including ischemia/oxidative stress, flow, and mechanical stretch (13Grierson J.P. Meldolesi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4451-4456Google Scholar, 14Hamada K. Takuwa N. Yokoyama K. Takuwa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6334-6340Google Scholar, 15Graff R.D. Lazarovski E.R. Banes A.J.

Because vascular cells have been shown to express metabotropic (P2Y) and/or ionotropic (P2X) subtypes of purinergic receptors and because these receptors have been shown to be implicated in mitogenic signaling pathways (8Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492Google Scholar, 9Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 78: 113-145Google Scholar, 17Nakamura E. Uezono Y. Narusawa K. Shibuya I. Oishi Y. Tanaka M. Yanagihara N. Nakamura T. Izumi F. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: C510-C519Google Scholar), released ATP could induce cell activation by an autocrine/paracrine mechanism. In fact, the extracellular concentration of ATP and subsequent purinergic activation appears to play a critical role in determining the intracellular signaling set point of many key growth-regulating factors (18Ostrom R.S. Gregorian C. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11735-11739Google Scholar, 19Dubyak G.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 51: C242-C244Google Scholar, 20Schwiebert L.M. Rice W.C. Kudlow B.A. Taylor A.L. Schwiebert E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C289-C301Google Scholar). Furthermore, the concentration of extracellular ATP is rapidly modulated by ecto-nucleotidases, which themselves may be regulated by environmental factors. Therefore, the release of ATP and modulation of its degradation by environmental or chemical stimuli may contribute to the set point of cellular signaling pathways regulated by P2 receptors and raises the possibility that extracellular ATP is a critical modulator of signal transduction pathways operating to control proliferative responses. It remains unclear, however, whether hypoxia actually increases extracellular concentrations of ATP in fibroblasts and whether ATP is a component of the hypoxia-induced proliferative response. It is known that hypoxia-induced cell proliferation is dependent on expression of specific transcription factors. However, the transcription factors involved in regulating the proliferative response of non-transformed vascular fibroblasts to moderate levels of hypoxia have not been elucidated. It is remarkable that many stress conditions that can trigger cell proliferation, including hypoxia, mechanical stress, and inflammation, can induce early growth response Egr-1 transcription factor (21Yan S.-F.

Res. 1997; 81: 457-461Google Scholar), which has been shown to be critical for proliferation and migration in many cell types (22Khachigian L.M. Anderson K.R. Halnon N.J.

These stress conditions have also been shown in independent experiments to induce ATP release in a variety of cell types (7Dubyak G.R. El-Moatassim C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C577-C606Google Scholar, 13Grierson J.P. Meldolesi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4451-4456Google Scholar, 26Forrester T. Williams C.A. J.

Experientia (Basel). 1995; 51: 256-259Google Scholar). Thus, it seems possible that hypoxia itself and/or hypoxia-induced increases in extracellular ATP could act to increase Egr-1 expression and activity, which might be necessary for DNA synthesis. However, little information exists as to whether ATP or hypoxia directly regulates Egr-1 expression in adventitial fibroblasts. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that hypoxic stress would increase extracellular ATP concentration, leading to the creation of a “purinergic network” where local ATP release, degradation, and stimulation of purinergic receptors operate to control fibroblast proliferation under hypoxic conditions. In addition, we hypothesized that ATP and hypoxia would up-regulate expression and activation of the Egr-1 transcription factor through Gαi-initiated, ERK1/2-dependent pathways. We used primary cultures of pulmonary artery adventitial fibroblasts to examine the effects of hypoxia and ATP on growth responses, Egr-1 expression, and DNA binding activity. We evaluated the effects of hypoxia on extracellular ATP concentration and on the enzymes (ecto-ATPase(s)) that catalyze extracellular ATP degradation. Finally, the role of ATP in hypoxia-induced growth, Egr-1 expression, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation was determined using pharmacological inhibitors. Our findings strongly support the possibility that extracellular ATP plays an important role in modulating hypoxic proliferative responses and that it significantly modulates the response of the fibroblast to other mitogens that may be present in the hypoxic environment. Pulmonary artery adventitial fibroblasts were isolated from tissue explants of 120–180-day gestational bovine fetuses as previously described (29Das M. Stenmark K.R. Dempsey E.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: L660-L667Google Scholar). Briefly, adventitia of lobar pulmonary artery was mechanically separated from the media and capillaries and chopped into small pieces (1 mm2) that were then placed in 6-well plastic culture dishes (1 per well). When numerous cells were observed around explants, tissue was removed, and cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20 mm l-glutamine (Cellgro), nonessential amino acids (1:100, v/v), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma), and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gemini Bio-Products, Woodland, CA). Cell cultures were maintained in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C, and medium was changed every 3 days. For expansion, fibroblasts were cultured to confluence, harvested with trypsin-EDTA solution (0.2–0.5 g/liter), and replaced at a 1:4 ratio. All studies were performed on cells between passages 2 and 6. For Northern and Western blot analysis, cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105cells/cm2, cultured to 80% of confluence, growth-arrested in 0.1% FBS/DMEM for 72 h, and then subjected to the experimental conditions described below under “DNA Synthesis Analysis.” Human lung microvascular endothelial cells were purchased as frozen primary cultures from Clonetics Ltd. (Walkersville, MD). Cells were cultured in endothelial cell basal medium (EBM-2) supplemented with vascular endothelial growth factor, human fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid, insulin-like growth factor, GA1000, and fetal bovine serum as per the manufacturer's protocol. Hypoxic and normoxic bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells were generous gifts from Dr. H. Farber (Boston University). DNA synthesis was determined by [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation. Cells were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 15 × 10 3cells/well in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. In 24 h cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated in serum-deprived (0.1% FBS) DMEM for 72 h. Then cells were stimulated with ATP (10−9–10−3m) under either normoxic (21% O2, 5% CO2 balance N2) or hypoxic (1, 3, or 10% O2, 5% CO2 balance N2) conditions at 37 °C in Plexiglas chambers (Bellco Glass, Vineland, NJ) in the presence of 1.0 μCi of [methyl-3H]thymidine (1 mCi/ml, 20 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 24 h. The effects of UTP, ADPβS, MeSATP, AMP-CPP, and BzATP (Sigma) on DNA synthesis were tested under normoxic conditions in a similar manner. When the effect of P2 receptor antagonists was tested, suramin, Cibacron blue 3GA, or PPADS (Sigma) were added at the concentrations of 100 μm 30 or 60 min before stimulation with ATP and/or hypoxia. For the experiments with apyrase, cells were preincubated for 2 h with a mixture of apyrases grade VI and VII (Sigma) at a final concentration of 5 units/ml media. In the experiments aimed to prevent ATP hydrolysis ARL67156 (300 μm) (30Dowd F.J. Li L.S. Zeng W. Arch. Oral Biol. 1999; 44: 1055-1062Google Scholar) or ATP-regeneration system (0.1 mg/ml creatine kinase, 4 mm phosphocreatine, and 0.025 mg/ml myokinase (31Nupenko E.V. Panchenko M.P. Starikova M.G. Grishin A.V. Tkachuk V.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1091: 213-221Google Scholar)) were added to the incubation media. At the end of incubation cells were washed twice with PBS, incubated with 0.5 ml of 0.2 m perchloric acid for 3 min, washed with 1 ml of PBS, and lysed in 0.3 ml of 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaOH. Samples were harvested and mixed with liquid scintillation mixture (Ecoscint H, National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA), and incorporated radioactivity was counted (cpm/min) in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS 6500). Total cellular RNA was extracted with either TriReagent solution (Sigma) or with RNeasy kit (Qiagen Inc., Santa Clarita, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA pellets were dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water and heated for 10 min at 55 °C. RNA concentration was determined by measurement of absorbency at 260 and 280 nm. Northern blot analysis was carried out by using NorthernMax-GlyTM blotting kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). 10–15 μg of total RNA were treated with glyoxal loading buffer and separated by 1% agarose formaldehyde gel electrophoresis at 85 V of constant voltage. After electrophoresis, RNA was transferred to HybondTM N+ membrane (AmershamBiosciences) by capillary transfer for 2–2.5 h. After transfer, membrane filters were briefly rinsed in a transfer buffer and UV-cross-linked (UV Stratalinker, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Membranes were prehybridized in hybridization solution (UltraHyb, Ambion) for 45 min at 68 °C and hybridized with 50–100 ng/ml digoxygenin-UTP-labeled RNA overnight at 68 °C. After washing, hybridized filters were probed with anti-digoxygenin antibodies (F(ab)2 fragments) conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (1:1000 dilution, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Bands corresponding to Egr-1 mRNA were detected using disodium 3-(4-methoxyspiro{1,2-dioxetane-3,2-(5′-chloro)tricyclo[3.3.1.13.7]decan}-4-yl phenyl phosphate (CSPD) chemiluminescent substrate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The antisense RNA probe for bovine Egr-1 was produced byin vitro transcription using a digoxygenin-labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A 1.4-kilobase fragment of Egr-1 cDNA ligated into pBluecript (+) vector was obtained from American Type Tissue collection (Manassas, VA). cDNA template was prepared by linearization of the plasmid by KpnI digestion upstream of T7 promoter, and digoxygenin-UTP-RNA probe was synthesized by reverse polymerase reaction. To provide normalization for RNA loading and transfer, after-UV-cross-linking blots were stained with 0.1% methylene blue, 0.5% acetic acid, and bands corresponding to 18 S rRNA were scanned. Alternatively, blots were double-probed with Egr-1 and β-actin digoxygenin-labeled RNA probes and normalized per β-actin mRNA. Fibroblasts were grown and serum-starved as described above. Culture media was then replaced with fresh serum-free DMEM, and cells were stimulated with either ATP (100 μm) or hypoxia (3% O2) for 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h. At the end of the incubation period, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, scraped off the dishes, and pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. Nuclear extracts were prepared using NE-PERTM extraction reagents (Piers, Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Nuclear extracts and the cytosolic fractions were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen in aliquots and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. 15 μg of nuclear protein extract was separated by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted to the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Hybond P, Amersham Biosciences) in Tris-glycine buffer (25 mm Tris-base, 0.2 m glycine, 25% (v/v) methanol, pH 8.3) at 350–400 V for 4 h at 4 °C. After transfer, membrane filters were stained with Ponceau S (Sigma) to verify equal protein loading and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-Tween (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. Membrane filters were probed with Egr-1 rabbit polyclonal antibodies (C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) at a dilution of 1:1000 in TBS-Tween with 5% milk for 1 h at 4 °C. After intensive washing in TBS-Tween, membrane filters were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:20,000 dilution, Amersham Biosciences), and immunoreactive bands were detected by Renaissance ECL detection kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) followed by exposure to Hyperfilm (AmershamBiosciences). Cells were plated in 6-well cell culture plates at a density of 100 ×103 cells/well, cultured to near confluence, and then serum-starved in 0.1% FBS, DMEM for 72–96 h. To evaluate the involvement of Gi proteins in ERK1/2 activation, cells were treated with pertussis toxin (PTx, 100 ng/ml) for 20–24 h. Cells were incubated under either normoxic (21% O2) or hypoxic (3% O2) conditions in fresh serum-free DMEM in the presence or absence of ATP (100 μm) for 10 min. After incubation, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed with cold Tris-HCl buffer (40 mm, pH 7.5) containing 0.25 m sucrose, 3 mm EGTA, 3 mm EDTA, 50 μmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and complete protease inhibitors mixture (Calbiochem). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 7500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatant fractions were collected and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration was determined by using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Samples of total cell protein (5 μg) were separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against phospho-ERK1/2 (Tyr202/Thr204), 1:1000 dilution (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) overnight at 4 °C. Blots were then washed with TBS-Tween buffer and incubated with mouse anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated IgG 1:10,000 dilution (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were detected by an ECL detection kit (Renaissance, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) followed by exposure to Hyperfilm. For detection of the nonphosphorylated form of ERK, membranes were stripped of the bound antibodies with buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 μm β-mercaptoethanol, blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-Tween, and reprobed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against total ERK1/2 (1:1000) (New England Biolabs). To detect DNA-protein complexes, nuclear extracts were incubated with 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe containing two copies of consensus (5′-GGA TCC AGC TAG GGC GAG CGG TAG CGA-3′) or mutant ((5′-GGA TCC AGC TAG GGC GAG CGG TAG CGA-3′) Egr-1 binding motifs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA). Oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled by using [γ-32P]ATP (3000Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with T4 polynucleotide kinase according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). Labeled oligonucleotides were purified using Chroma Spin columns-10 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The binding reaction was carried out for 30 min at room temperature in 20 μl of mixture containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 μm ZnCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 0.5–1 ng of 32P-labeled DNA (8000 cpm), and 5 μg of nuclear protein. For the competition study, incubation mixtures containing a 80-fold excess of unlabeled Egr-1 oligonucleotides were used. To test the specificity of Egr-1 DNA binding complexes, antibody blocking experiments were carried out. Nuclear extracts were preincubated with 2 μg of specific anti- Egr-1 polyclonal IgG (C-19X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 45 min at room temperature and then subjected to the binding reaction. Protein-DNA binding complexes were separated from free DNA probe by native 4% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 0.5× TBE running buffer (0.045m Tris borate, 0.001 m EDTA, pH 8.5) at 30 mA constant current for 3–3.5 h. Gels were vacuum-dried and exposed to Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences) in a cassette with two intensifying screens at −80 °C for 6–20 h. Total ATP content in the extracellular media was detected with luciferase-luciferin kit (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, Sparks, MD) using a Monolight 3010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). Cells in 60-cm2 Petri dishes (at a density of 500 × 103 cells/cm2) were exposed to either normoxic (21% O2) or hypoxic (3% O2 and/or 1% O2) conditions for the periods of time indicated in Fig. 1. At the beginning of the experiment, medium was drained from the cells and fresh medium that had been pre-equilibrated with the appropriate gas mixture was infused onto the cell monolayer. After incubation, 1 ml of conditioned media was collected into chilled polypropylene tubes (Sigma) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min to remove any cell debris. Individual 100-μl aliquots were taken and heated at 95 °C for 1 min, and the luciferin-luciferase assay was carried out. The sampled luminescence was compared with an ATP standard curve performed in each individual experiment. Cells were cultured under normoxic (21% O2) or hypoxic (3% O2) conditions for 3–4 passages and then plated in 12-well culture dishes (40 × 103 cells/well). Confluent cells were growth-arrested for 72 h as described above and washed twice with 1 ml of PBS (37 °C). To determine the products of [α-32P]ATP hydrolysis (specifically, [α-32P]ADP, [α-32P]AMP, and 32Pi), culture medium was replaced with 0.6 ml of serum-free DMEM (25 °C), and the reaction was initiated by adding 0.1 mm ATP and 5 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (30 Ci/mmol, 2 mCi/ml, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After the indicated periods of time (Fig. 2), 2-μl aliquots of culture medium were taken and spotted onto polyethyleneimine-cellulose-coated TLC plates (Sigma) and chromatographed in 1 m LiCl for 2.5–3 h. Radioactive spots corresponding to adenine nucleotides and Pi were detected by autoradiography using Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences) and verified to be at the same position as those of unlabeled adenine nucleotide standards. Density of bands of Western and Northern blot film images was determined by using NIH Image 1.58 program. Data are expressed as the average means ± S.E.; n equals the number of replicates in one experiment or a number of observations in independent experiments. To evaluate the significance of the obtained data, analysis of variance between groups of data was performed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test followed by one-way analysis of variance. We first sought to determine whether hypoxia would stimulate ATP release from fibroblasts (Fig. 1). Quiescent growth-arrested adventitial fibroblasts were exposed to pre-equilibrated normoxic or hypoxic media (21, 3, and 1% O2) for up to 24 h. Zero-minute data represent the concentration of ATP in the pre-equilibrated media before it was added to cells. We found that ATP accumulated in the media of unstimulated fibroblasts even under normoxic conditions (note the 24 h concentration), consistent with constitutive release of ATP, as has been observed in human skin fibroblasts and another cell types (32Lazarovski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31061-31068Google Scholar,33Solini A. Chiozzi P. Morelli A. Fellin R. Di Virgilio J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 297-305Google Scholar). Exposure of fibroblasts to hypoxic conditions, which stimulated cell growth (3 and 1% O2) resulted in increased accumulation of ATP in the media, with the highest concentration seen at 10 min and with persistently increased concentrations observed even at 24 h (Fig. 1 A). Other cells in the vessel wall also may be a source of ATP for adventitial fibroblasts. Because increased extracellular ATP concentrations have been observed in endothelial cells exposed to hemodynamic stress and because in small vessels they can be the source of many paracrine factors that influence fibroblast function (28Bodin P. Burnstock G. Experientia (Basel). 1995; 51: 256-259Google Scholar), we evaluated the effect of hypoxic exposure on endothelial extracellular ATP levels. We found that hypoxia caused increases in the concentration of ATP in the media of endothelial cells that were about 10-fold highe"

The much higher enzymatic activity of human group X sPLA2(hGX) compared with human group IIA sPLA2 (hGIIA) on phosphatidylcholine (PC)-rich vesicles is due in large part to the higher affinity of the former enzyme for such vesicles; this result also holds when vesicles contain cholesterol and sphingomyelin. The inclusion of anionic phosphatidylserine in PC vesicles dramatically enhances interfacial binding and catalysis of hGIIA but not of hGX. This is the result of the large number of lysine and arginine residues scattered over the entire surface of hGIIA, which cause the enzyme to form a supramolecular aggregate with multiple vesicles. Thus, high affinity binding of hGIIA to anionic vesicles is a complex process and cannot be attributed to a few basic residues on its interfacial binding surface, as is also evident from mutagenesis studies. The main reason hGIIA binds poorly to PC-rich vesicles is that it lacks a tryptophan residue on its interfacial binding surface, a residue that contributes to the high affinity binding of hGX to PC-rich vesicles. Results show that the lag in the onset of hydrolysis of PC vesicles by hGIIA is due in part to the poor affinity of this enzyme for these vesicles. Binding affinity of hGIIA, hGX, and their mutants to PC-rich vesicles is well correlated to the ability of these enzymes to act on the PC-rich outer plasma membrane of mammalian cells.

The Phospholipases. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1987Google Scholar). Most mammalian tissues contain one or more members of the sPLA2 family (10 gene products in mice and 9 genes plus one pseudogene in humans) (2Valentin E. Lambeau G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 59-70Google Scholar). There has been intense interest in the role of sPLA2s in the liberation of arachidonic acid from cellular phospholipids for the formation of the eicosanoids (3Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Atsumi G. Inoue K. Kudo I. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 17: 225-283Google Scholar, 4Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Insel P.A. Dennis E.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 175-189Google Scholar). Also, given the molecular diversity of sPLA2s and their distinct tissue distribution patterns, it is highly likely that these enzymes are involved in other physiological responses besides inflammation. Some of these additional functions are known and include digestion of dietary phospholipids in the gastrointestinal track by pancreatic (group IB) sPLA2 (5Verheij H.M. Slotboom A.J. De Haas G.H. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1981; 91: 91-203Google Scholar) and possibly other sPLA2s (6Richmond B.L. Boileau A.C. Zheng S. Huggins K.W. Granholm N.A. Tso P. Hui D.Y. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1193-1202Google Scholar), bactericidal action of human group IIA sPLA2 in phagocytic cells, and in human tears (7Foreman-Wykert A.K. Weinrauch Y. Elsbach P. Weiss J. J.

Elias P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 57-63Google Scholar, 13Schadow A. Scholz-Pedretti K. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. Furstenberger G. Pfeilschifter J. Kaszkin M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 116: 31-39Google Scholar). sPLA2s have also been extensively studied as a paradigm for enzymes that act at the lipid-water interface (interfacial enzymes) (14Berg O.G. Gelb M.H. Tsai M.-D. Jain M.K. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2613-2654Google Scholar, 15Berg O.G. Jain M.K. Interfacial Enzyme Kinetics. Wiley, West Sussex, England2002Google Scholar). Kinetic studies of sPLA2s in the scooting mode establish that these enzymes bind to the membrane surface as a prelude to the loading of the active site with a single phospholipid molecule for the lipolysis reaction (16Jain M.K. Rogers J. Marecek J.F. Ramirez F. Eibl H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 860: 462-474Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of several sPLA2s reveal a deep active site surrounded by a nearly planar protein surface (17Scott D.L. Sigler P.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 53-88Google Scholar). The latter has been shown to function as the interfacial recognition surface (also called IBS) (18Ramirez F. Jain M.K. Proteins. 1991; 9: 229-239Google Scholar, 19Lin Y. Nielsen R. Murray D. Mailer C. Hubbell W.L. Robinson B.H. Gelb M.H. Science. 1998; 279: 1925-1929Google Scholar, 20Ying H.P. Epstein T.M. Jain M.K. Bahnson B.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 609-617Google Scholar). By studying the properties of porcine pancreatic and cobra venom sPLA2s, it was realized early on that sPLA2s display large variation in their affinities for membranes of differing phospholipid composition (21Jain M.K. De Haas G.H. Marecek J.F. Ramirez F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 860: 475-483Google Scholar). This leads to phenomena that are characteristic of interfacial enzymes. For example, in considering the substrate specificities of sPLA2s, one must distinguish between the phospholipid binding specificity of the active site slotversus the IBS (22Ghomashchi F. Yu B.-Z. Berg O. Jain M.K. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7318-7329Google Scholar). Another example is the lag phase in the onset of phospholipid hydrolysis when porcine pancreatic sPLA2 is added to PC vesicles (14Berg O.G. Gelb M.H. Tsai M.-D. Jain M.K. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2613-2654Google Scholar). This lag is due, in part, to the fact that this sPLA2 binds very weakly to vesicles of pure PC (zwitterionic head group) compared with vesicles containing phospholipids with reaction products (fatty acid plus lysophospholipid). Thus the reaction proceeds initially very slow as most of the enzyme is in the aqueous phase, and product formation accelerates as enzyme accumulates on product-containing vesicles. It is becoming clear that differential binding of mammalian sPLA2s to membranes of differing phospholipid composition has physiological significance. For example, human tears contain a high concentration of human group IIA sPLA2 (hGIIA), and this enzyme is the principal bactericidal factor against Gram-positive bacteria in this fluid (8Qu X.D. Lehrer R.I. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2791-2797Google Scholar). Yet the enzyme does not degrade the outer plasma membrane of a number of mammalian cells (23Bezzine S. Koduri R.S. Valentin E. Murakami M. Kudo I. Ghomashchi F. Sadilek M. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3179-3191Google Scholar, 24Enomoto A. Murakami M. Valentin E. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. Kudo I. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 10083-10096Google Scholar). This is probably because of the fact that the outer plasma membrane of mammalian cells are rich in PC, and hGIIA displays virtually no enzymatic activity on PC-rich liposomes in vitro (26Bayburt T. Yu B.-Z. Lin H.-K. Browning J. Jain M.K. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 573-582Google Scholar, 27Kinkaid A.R. Wilton D.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 507-512Google Scholar). On the other hand human groups V and X sPLA2 display relatively high activity on PC-rich liposomes and are able to liberate free fatty acids including arachidonic acid when added exogenously to a variety of mammalian cells (23Bezzine S. Koduri R.S. Valentin E. Murakami M. Kudo I. Ghomashchi F. Sadilek M. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3179-3191Google Scholar, 28Han S.K. Kim K.P. Koduri R. Bittova L. Munoz N.M.

Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34203-34211Google Scholar). In this sense, groups V and X sPLA2s resemble cobra venom sPLA2s, which have been known for several years to efficiently hydrolyze mammalian cell membranes and PC vesicles without a lag in the onset of the reaction (21Jain M.K. De Haas G.H. Marecek J.F. Ramirez F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 860: 475-483Google Scholar). It is interesting to understand in molecular detail the basis for the differential interfacial binding of sPLA2 to membranes. Because a systematic study of the membrane binding properties of the full set of human and murine groups I, II, V, X, and XII sPLA2s shows that hGIIA displays the lowest specific activity for the hydrolysis of the outer plasma membrane of mammalian cells while the human group X sPLA2 (hGX) displays the highest specific activity, 2Singer, A. G., Ghomashchi, F., LeCalvez, C., Bollinger, J., Bezzine, S., Rouault, M., Sadilek, M., Nguyen, E., Lazdunski, M., Lambeau, G., and Gelb, M. H. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 48535–48549. 2Singer, A. G., Ghomashchi, F., LeCalvez, C., Bollinger, J., Bezzine, S., Rouault, M., Sadilek, M., Nguyen, E., Lazdunski, M., Lambeau, G., and Gelb, M. H. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 48535–48549.we decided to carry out a structure-function study of the interfacial binding properties of hGIIA and hGX. Previous attempts to quantify the binding of sPLA2s to vesicles of anionic phospholipids have been hampered by the exceptionally high affinity of these enzymes for anionic vesicles. Thus, only limiting values for the equilibrium constant for dissociation of the enzyme from the vesicle into the aqueous phase,Kd, have been obtained (for example, Refs. 18Ramirez F. Jain M.K. Proteins. 1991; 9: 229-239Google Scholar and31Snitko Y. Koduri R.S. Han S.K. Othman R. Baker S.F. Molini B. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14325-14333Google Scholar). In the present study we have applied a new method for accurate quantification of values of Kd that describe the affinity of sPLA2s to vesicles composed of charge-neutral PC containing various concentrations of the anionic phospholipid PS. We have applied this method to study the interfacial binding of hGIIA and hGX as well as their mutants in which IBS residues have been changed. We also correlate the interfacial binding data with interfacial kinetic results to examine the functional consequences of interfacial binding of sPLA2s to vesicles. Recombinant hGIIA was produced as its N1A mutant (to facilitate removal of the initiator methionine in Escherichia coli) as described (N1A has the same specific activity as the wild type enzyme when analyzed on a variety of phospholipid vesicles) (32Koduri R.S. Baker S.F. Snitko Y. Han S.K. Cho W. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32142-32153Google Scholar). Recombinant hGX was also produced by expression in bacteria as described (33Pan Y.H. Yu B.-Z. Singer A.G. Ghomashchi F. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. Jain M.K. Bahnson B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29086-29093Google Scholar). Other recombinant sPLA2s used in the study were produced as described (32Koduri R.S. Baker S.F. Snitko Y. Han S.K. Cho W. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32142-32153Google Scholar, 34Ghomashchi F. Lin F. Yu B.-Z. Annand R.A. Jain M.K. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6697-6710Google Scholar). hGIIA and hGX mutants were prepared using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene), and the full-length coding regions were sequenced. SDS-PAGE analysis of all proteins showed that they are >98% pure, and electrospray mass spectrometry analysis2 showed that all disulfide bonds are intact.14C-SM (55 Ci/mol) and 14C-CH (50 Ci/mol) were from American Radiochemicals Inc. The diether phospholipids DOetPC and DOetPS were synthesized as described (35Hixon M.S. Ball A. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8516Google Scholar). Diether phospholipids were mixed in chloroform, and solvent was removed in vacuo. Extrusion buffer (5 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 176 mmsucrose) was added, and vesicles were prepared by extrusion using a Liposofast device (Avestin Inc.) as described (36Bayburt T. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3216-3231Google Scholar) except that vesicles were first extruded through a stack of two 0.8-μm Nucleopore filters and then extruded through a stack of two 0.2-μm filters. A trace amount of 1-palmitoyl-2-[9,10-3H]palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (American Radiochemicals Inc., 90 Ci/mmol) was present (sufficient amount such that the binding sample containing the lowest phospholipid concentration used contained a total of 500–1,000 cpm) so that the concentration of total phospholipid could be monitored by scintillation counting of a sample aliquot after each step in the process. Yields of phospholipid after extrusion were typically >90%. The diameter and polydispersity of extruded vesicles in binding buffer was examined by using a BIC particle analyzer (Brookhaven Instruments). Typical values were 100–130 nm for the diameter and 0.08–0.095 for the polydispersity. Stock solutions of extruded vesicles were stored at room temperature and used the same day for binding studies. Particle size analysis scattering indicated no change in vesicle size and polydispersity over the storage period. The extruded vesicle solution was diluted 6-fold with binding buffer (5 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 0.1 m KCl, 2 mmCaCl2), and the solution was centrifuged in a 1.5-ml polyallomar microcentrifuge tube at 100,000 × g at 21 °C for 1 h in a Kompsin vertical rotor. Most of the supernatant was removed with a pipettor, and the same volume of binding buffer was added to the remaining vesicle pellet. Vesicles were resuspended by gentle up and down passage with a pipettor. This step ensures removal of vesicles that do not pellet (perhaps disrupted vesicles). An aliquot of the resuspended vesicle solution was submitted to scintillation counting to obtain the total phospholipid concentration. In some experiments, the binding buffer contained 0.1 mm EGTA and no CaCl2. Binding reactions were prepared in polyallomar tubes containing 100 μl of binding buffer with the desired concentration of sucrose-loaded vesicles and 0.5 μg of sPLA2 (proportionally less enzyme was used for vesicles concentrations less than 0.1 mm). In the case of hGIIA-V3W, 50 ng of enzyme was used per binding reaction, and the binding buffer also contained 1 mg/ml γ-globulin (Sigma catalog number G4386) to prevent nonspecific binding of enzyme to the polyallomar tube. Tubes were centrifuged as above, and most of the supernatant was immediately transferred to new tubes. A portion of this supernatant was submitted to scintillation counting to determine the fraction of vesicles that pelleted (typically >90%). A second portion of supernatant was diluted into 3% bovine serum albumin, to minimize loss of enzyme to the tube wall, and an aliquot of this solution was submitted to an sPLA2 enzymatic assay using 1-palmitoyl-2-(10-pyrenedecanoyl)-sn-glceryo-3-phosphomethanol (37Dudler T. Chen W.-Q. Wang S. Schneider T. Annand R.R. Dempcy R.O. Crameri R. Gmachl M. Suter M. Gelb M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1165: 201-210Google Scholar). Because the specific activity of the different sPLA2s varies considerably, the amount of supernatant taken and the extent of its dilution with 3% bovine serum albumin in water were chosen such that the reaction velocity measured in the assay was at least 5-fold higher than the minus sPLA2 background rate. In some experiments, CH and SM where included in vesicles. By doping the vesicles with trace amounts of 14C-CH and14C-SM (in separate experiments), it was found that the yields of these lipids was high (>95%) after extrusion. This rules out the possibility that CH, SM, DOetPC, and DOetPS pass through the membrane filters to different extents (because of differential solubility of lipids in the aggregates). Vesicles containing DOetPC/SM/CH had a diameter of 214 nm and a polydispersity of 0.151. The percent sPLA2 remaining in the supernatant, based on enzymatic activity (100% is the amount of sPLA2 activity in the supernatant of a sample processed as above but in the absence of vesicles), was plotted versus the total phospholipid present in the binding reaction. The curve was fit to the standard equation for equilibrium dissociation: 100 × (E/ET) =Kd/(L + Kd), whereE is the concentration of sPLA2 in the aqueous phase, ET is the concentration of total enzyme (free and vesicle bound) in the binding reaction, L is the total phospholipid concentration in the binding reaction (expressed as total moles of phospholipid, DOetPC + DOetPS divided by the volume of binding reaction sample), andKd is the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of vesicle-bound enzyme into the aqueous layer. The recovery of all sPLA2s used in the study from centrifuged samples that lacked vesicles was >80%. Thus, no correction was needed for loss of enzyme to the walls of the polyallomar tubes. Right angle scattering of visible light was used to explore sPLA2-dependent aggregation of vesicles. Binding buffer (1 ml, see above) was placed in a fluorescence cuvette, and scattering was monitored in a fluorimeter (excitation at 505 nm and emission set to 502 nm, 6 nm slit widths). Sucrose-loaded vesicles, prepared as described above, were added to give 50 μm phospholipid in the cuvette, and the signal was recorded for ∼1 min with stirring at room temperature. sPLA2 (5 μg) was added, and the signal was recorded for 20–30 min. Some scattering studies were done in the absence of calcium. In this case, binding buffer contained 0.1 mm EGTA in place of CaCl2. POPC or POPG unilamellar vesicles of 0.1-μm diameter were prepared by extrusion (36Bayburt T. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3216-3231Google Scholar) (because low millimolar concentrations of phospholipids were extruded, the initial extrusion through 0.8-μm filters, see above, was omitted). As above, vesicles were doped with a trace amount of tritiated PC. The rate of phospholipid hydrolysis by sPLA2was measured by monitoring the displacement of a fluorescent fatty acid analog from fatty acid-binding protein (23Bezzine S. Koduri R.S. Valentin E. Murakami M. Kudo I. Ghomashchi F. Sadilek M. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3179-3191Google Scholar, 27Kinkaid A.R. Wilton D.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 507-512Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 30 μm phospholipid in 1.3 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution with 1.27 mm Mg2+ and 0.90 mm Ca2+ (Invitrogen) containing 10 μg of liver fatty acid-binding protein (23Bezzine S. Koduri R.S. Valentin E. Murakami M. Kudo I. Ghomashchi F. Sadilek M. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3179-3191Google Scholar) and 1 μm11-dansylundecanoic acid (Molecular Probes Inc.). Reactions were monitored at 37 °C with magnetic stirring in a fluorimeter (emission at 500 nm, excitation at 350 nm, 10 nm slit widths). Assays were calibrated to give moles of oleic acid released by adding a known amount of oleic acid and monitoring the drop in fluorescence. Studies to measure the preference of the sPLA2s for the fatty acyl chain at the sn-2 position were carried out as described (26Bayburt T. Yu B.-Z. Lin H.-K. Browning J. Jain M.K. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 573-582Google Scholar) using POPG vesicles containing 1-palmitoyl-2-[9,10-3H]palmitoyl phosphatidylcholine and 1-stearoyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonyl phosphatidylcholine. Arachidonic acid release from mammalian cells (human embryonic kidney cells, HEK293) was measured by determining the counts/min of radioactivity released into the culture medium when [3H]arachidonic acid-labeled cells were incubated with sPLA2 for 3 h at 37 °C as described (23Bezzine S. Koduri R.S. Valentin E. Murakami M. Kudo I. Ghomashchi F. Sadilek M. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3179-3191Google Scholar). Arachidonic acid release studies were also carried out using Hanks' balanced salt solution (with calcium and magnesium, see above) instead of complete medium. Some studies were carried out with SV40-transformed human corneal epithelial cells (38Araki-Sasaki K. Ohashi Y. Sasabe T. Hayashi K. Watanabe H. Tano Y. Handa H. Invest. Ophthanol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 614-621Google Scholar) (obtained as a gift from Dr. Rajiv R. Mohan, Department of Ophthalmology, University of Washington). These cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (1/1 ratio, Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 5 ng/ml insulin, 0.1 ng/ml cholera toxin, 10 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor, and 0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide at 37 °C under humidified air containing 5% CO2. Cells were placed in 1 ml of complete medium at 5 × 105 cells/ml, seeded in each well of a 24-well plate, and incubated overnight to near confluence. [3H]Arachidonic acid (0.1 μCi) was added to each well, and the cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C. The labeled cells were washed two times with complete medium and then placed in 1 ml of fresh medium. The cells were treated with various amounts of sPLA2s at 37 °C for 6 h. After the medium was removed and briefly microcentrifuged to remove any detached cells, 0.5 ml of the medium was analyzed by scintillation counting. The remaining cells were dissolved in 1 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH (2/1), and the sample was submitted to scintillation counting after removal of the organic solvent in vacuo. [3H]Arachidonic acid release is expressed as percentage of the cell medium counts/min to the total counts/min (medium + organic extract). Interfacial binding of sPLA2 to 0.1-μm unilamellar vesicles of varying phospholipid composition was quantified by sedimenting vesicles and measuring the fraction of sPLA2 remaining in the supernatant. Vesicles are loaded with sucrose so that they can be sedimented in an ultracentrifuge (39Buser C.A. Sigal C.T. Resh M.D. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13093-13101Google Scholar). Sucrose-loaded vesicles are not under osmotic stress because of the presence of 0.1 m KCl in the binding buffer outside of the vesicles (39Buser C.A. Sigal C.T. Resh M.D. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13093-13101Google Scholar). Also, the addition of 0.1 m KCl to the binding buffer brings the ionic strength to a value close to the physiological one. The sedimentation method has a number of advantages over other methods. It does not require that the protein contain a spectral probe (i.e. a fluorophore), it is applicable under a wide range of vesicle concentrations (scattering from vesicles hampers the use of fluorescence methods with phospholipid concentrations greater than about 50–100 μm), and it is inexpensive compared with methods such as surface plasmon resonance. One problem that arises with all methods to measure vesicle-protein binding is nonspecific binding of protein to the walls of the centrifuge tube; this problem is more pronounced when low protein concentrations are used in an attempt to measure smallKd values. To avoid using enzyme concentrations less than about 10 nm, we have adjusted the mole percent of anionic DOetPS in DOetPC vesicles such that accurate values of Kd can be obtained in the ∼1–3,000 μm range. Additionally, inclusion of 1 mg/ml γ-globulin in the binding buffer, but not bovine serum albumin, prevented nonspecific binding of hGIIA and hGIIA-V3W to the polyallomar tubes when using enzyme concentrations down to 10 nm. The phospholipid:sPLA2 mole ratio in the interfacial binding reactions was at least 200. This was chosen to avoid crowding of enzyme on the vesicle surface. Approximately 100 phospholipids per enzyme lie on the enzyme-accessible outer leaflet of the vesicles, and each sPLA2 binds to about 30–50 phospholipids. Thus when 50% of the sPLA2 is bound to vesicles, the surface coverage by protein is ∼25% of maximal coverage. Under these conditions, the simple binding equation (see “Experimental Procedures”) is appropriate, i.e. the depletion of enzyme binding sites on vesicles during the binding titration can be ignored. Also, the effect of interaction between proteins co-localized on vesicles can most likely be ignored so that Kd is a reflection of the energetics of an isolated enzyme sitting on the vesicle dissociating into the aqueous phase (although see below for studies with hGIIA). Measurement of such Kd values seems most appropriate for interpreting the role of IBS amino acid residues in supporting interfacial binding of sPLA2s. To best correlate the interfacial binding and phospholipid hydrolysis kinetic data, binding studies were carried out in the presence of saturating calcium. This requires the use of diether phospholipid vesicles to avoid sPLA2-catalyzed generation of reaction products because the latter can modulate the Kd(14Berg O.G. Gelb M.H. Tsai M.-D. Jain M.K. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2613-2654Google Scholar). Values of Kd measured in the presence of calcium are apparent values as they reflect binding of enzyme to the interface and the binding of a single phospholipid molecule in the active site of the interface-bound enzyme. The latter step requires calcium (40Yu B.-Z. Berg O.G. Jain M.K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6485-6492Google Scholar) and helps bind the enzyme to vesicles by mass action (however, see below for studies with hGIIA). Some binding studies were carried out in the absence of calcium using both diether and diester phospholipid vesicles. As reported previously, the initial velocity for the action of hGIIA on POPC vesicles is >1,000-fold lower than that measured with anionic POPG vesicles (23Bezzine S. Koduri R.S. Valentin E. Murakami M. Kudo I. Ghomashchi F. Sadilek M. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3179-3191Google Scholar) (Table I). hGIIA readily hydrolyzes PC when enzyme is tightly bound to anionic phosphatidylmethanol vesicles (26Bayburt T. Yu B.-Z. Lin H.-K. Browning J. Jain M.K. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 573-582Google Scholar, 30Hanasaki K. Yamada K. Yamamoto S. Ishimoto Y. Saiga A. Ono T. Ikeda M. Notoya M. Kamitani S. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29116-29124Google Scholar), which shows that PC is well accommodated in the catalytic site. Thus, the low activity on POPC vesicles is predicted to be due either to poor interfacial binding to these charge-neutral vesicles or to catalytically nonproductive binding or both.Table ISpecific activities for the hydrolysis of vesicles by hGIIA and hGX and their i-face mutantssPLA2Vo (POPG)aInitial velocities, Vo, are given. In some cases, as noted, a lag was observed in the onset of phospholipid hydrolysis after the addition of sPLA2 to the reaction mixture.

https://openalex.org/W2042525168,"Vascular permeability factor/vascular endothelial growth factor (VPF/VEGF) functions by activating two receptor tyrosine kinases, Flt-1 (VEGFR-1) and KDR (VEGFR-2), both of which are selectively expressed on the primary vascular endothelium. KDR is responsible for VPF/VEGF-stimulated endothelial cell (EC) proliferation and migration, whereas Flt-1 down-modulates KDR-mediated EC proliferation. Flt-1 mediates down-regulation of EC proliferation through pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins, βγ subunits, small GTPase CDC42, and partly by Rac-1. However, the molecular mechanism by which KDR mediates EC migration is not clear yet. Here we show for the first time that activation of RhoA and Rac1 is fully and partially required for KDR-mediated human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) migration, respectively, and that CDC42, however, is not involved. Furthermore, overexpression of the RhoA dominant negative mutant RhoA-19N does not affect VPF/VEGF-stimulated KDR phosphorylation, intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation. Utilizing the receptor chimeras (EGDR and EGLT) in which the extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was fused to the transmembrane domain and the intracellular domains of KDR and Flt-1, respectively, we demonstrate that RhoA activation is mediated by EGDR, not by EGLT, and that EGDR mediates activation of Rac1, not CDC42. Furthermore, the EGDR-mediated RhoA and Rac1 activation is regulated by G proteins Gq/11, Gβγ, and phospholipase C independent of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. Interestingly, the RhoA activation can be partially inhibited by overexpression of Rac1–17N, but overexpression of RhoA-19N has no effect on Rac1 activation. Finally, Gq/11 and Gβγ subunits are also required for VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVEC migration. Taken together, our results indicate that KDR stimulates endothelial cell migration through a heterotrimeric G protein Gq/11 and Gβγ-mediated RhoA pathway.

Recently it was shown that Flt-1 activation down-modulates KDR-mediated proliferation using different VPF/VEGF receptor chimeric fusion systems (10Rahimi N. Dayanir V. Lashkari K. J. Biol.

It is also indicated that Flt-1 mediated down-regulation of endothelial cell proliferation through pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins, Gbγ subunits, small GTPase CDC42, and partly by Rac-1 (11Zeng H.

Chem. 2002; 277: 4003-4009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A variety of evidence indicates that the activity of phospholipase C (PLC) is required for both EC proliferation and migration, and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and MAPK phosphorylation are required for VPF/VEGF-stimulated proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) but not migration (11Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar,13Zeng H. Sanyal S. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32714-32719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However the molecular mechanism by which VPF/VEGF stimulates HUVEC migration is not clear. The Rho family of the small GTPase superfamily has been shown to play an important role in cell growth, migration, transformation, and gene expression (14Aspenstrom P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The Rho family includes Rho (RhoA, RhoB, RhoC, RhoE, and RhoG), Rac (Rac1, Rac2, Rac3, and RhoG), CDC42 (CDC42Hs, G25K, and TC10), Rnd (RhoE/Rnd3, Rnd1/Rho6, and Rnd2/Rh07), RhoD, and TTF (14Aspenstrom P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Among them, RhoA, Rac1, and CDC42 are the most extensively studied members of this family. RhoA primarily induces the formation of stress fibers, whereas Rac1 and CDC42 promote the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia, respectively, when they are expressed in cells (15Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar, 16Machesky L.M. Insall R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). It was reported that VPF/VEGF induces actin-based mobility (17Rousseau S. Houle F. Huot J. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), suggesting that Rho family proteins might be involved in this response. Recently, we reported that CDC42 and Rac1 are required and partially required for Flt-1-mediated antiproliferation activity, respectively. However, whether RhoA family members play any role in VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVEC migration is not known. In this study, we show that overexpression of dominant negative RhoA (RhoA-19N) and Rac1 (Rac1–17N) inhibits and partially inhibits VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVEC migration, respectively. However, overexpression of dominant negative CDC42 (CDC42–17N) has no effect. Overexpression of RhoA-19N has no effect on intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and MAPK phosphorylation in VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVECs. Recently, we reported (12Zeng H. Zhao D. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4003-4009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) that CDC42 and Rac1 were directly activated in VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVECs and that the CDC42 and Rac1 activation could be mediated by Flt-1. Here, we show that RhoA is also activated in VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVECs. Using our receptor chimeras EGDR and EGLT, in which the N-terminal domains of KDR and Flt-1, respectively, were replaced with the N-terminal domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), we further show that the activation of RhoA is mediated by EGDR, not EGLT. EGDR also mediates Rac1 activation but not CDC42 activation. Furthermore, we show that an EGDR mutant (EGDR(Y951F)) lacking the migrating activity of EGDR also lost the ability to induce Rho activity; however, this mutant could partially activate Rac1 (13Zeng H. Sanyal S. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32714-32719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Moreover, EGDR-mediated activation of RhoA and Rac1, respectively, requires PLC activity but not PI3K activity or intracellular calcium mobilization. However, different pathways are required for Rac1-dependent and -independent RhoA activation. Finally, we show that Gq/11 proteins and Gβγ subunits are required for KDR-mediated RhoA and Rac1 activation and for VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVEC migration.

Cells over a range from 3 × 103 to 1 × 105 cells per well were seeded in a 96-well plate for the standard curve. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to allow the cells to attach, then VPF/VEGF was added at a final concentration of 10 ng/ml. After incubation for an additional 2 h, cells remaining on the upper surface of the transwell filter membrane were wiped off with a cotton tip. The whole transwell membrane was cut out and placed in an individual well of the 96-well plate that contained the cells for the standard curve. 200 μl of Cyquant DNA stain was added to each well containing cells or membrane, and the plate was kept at 4 °C overnight. After warming to room temperature, stained cells were counted in a spectrofluorometer (SpectraFluor; TECAN) with Delta Soft 3 software. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of quadruplicate values. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Serum-starved HUVECs transduced with LacZ or Rho-19N were treated with 10 ng/ml VPF/VEGF for different time intervals as indicated. Cell lysates were either subjected to Western blot analysis using an antibody specific for active forms of MAPK/ERK kinase or immunoprecipitated with an KDR antibody followed by immunoblotting with a phospho-tyrosine antibody as described previously (11Zeng H.

Serum-starved HUVECs transfected with LacZ or RhoA-19N were loaded with Fura-2 AM and stimulated with 10 ng/ml VPF/VEGF. An assay was carried out as described (11Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D.

The RhoA activity assay was modified from that used by Ren et al. (21Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar, 22Petrova T.V.

The glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Rhotekin Rho binding domain (TRBD) fusion protein was kindly provided by Dr. Martin Schwartz (Scripps Institute). Bacteria were grown to an optical density of 0.8 at a wavelength of 600 nm and induced with 1 mm of isopropylthiogalactoside (IPTG) for 3 h. Bacteria were aliquoted per 50 ml and collected by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 20 min and frozen at −80 °C. To prepare the GST·TRBD beads, each aliquot of 50 ml of frozen bacteria was resuspended in 2 ml of cold PBS followed by the addition of 20 μl of 1 m dithiothreitol, 20 μl of 0.2 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 40 μl of lysozyme (50 μg/ml). After incubation on ice for 30 min, 225 μl of 10% Triton X-100, 22.5 μl of 1 m MgCl2, 22.5 μl of DNase I (2,000 kilo-units/ml) were added. After another 30 min incubation on ice, the bacteria were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was incubated with 200 μl of glutathione-coupled Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences), which were washed with bead-washing buffer (PBS with 10 mmdithiothreitol and 1% Triton X-100) three times. After incubation at 4 °C for 45 min, beads were washed three times with bead-washing buffer and resuspended in the bead-washing buffer to give out 50% bead slur. For 24 h, serum-starved HUVECs with or without infection with retrovirus or transfected with antisense oligonucleotides were stimulated with 10 ng/ml VPF/VEGF or EGF for different time intervals. Stimulation was stopped by the addition of ice-cold PBS. Cells were washed three times with PBS and lysed with lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1% IGEPAL, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 3 min. The supernatant was incubated with 50 μl of GST·TRBD beads at 4 °C for 45 min. Proteins bound to beads were washed trice with AP wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For inhibitor experiments, different concentrations of inhibitors as indicated were added 5 min before EGF treatment. All experiments were repeated at least three times. CDC and Rac1 assays were carried out as described previously (12Zeng H. Zhao D. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4003-4009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Basely, these were the same as the RhoA assay described above, except that GST·Pak·CRIB beads, not GST·TRBD beads, were used. Recently, we have shown (12Zeng H. Zhao D. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4003-4009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) that dominant negative mutants of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 (RhoA-19N, Rac1–17N, and CDC42–17N) that block their endogenous functions have different effects on VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVEC proliferation. CDC42–17N and Rac1–17N completely and partially inhibit Flt-1-mediated anti-proliferative activity, respectively, whereas RhoA-19N has no effect. In this study we further examined whether the dominant negative mutants CDC42–17N, RhoA-19N, and Rac1–17N have any effects on VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVEC migration. CDC42–17N, Rho-19N, and Rac1–17N were overexpressed in HUVECs as described previously (11Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 12Zeng H. Zhao D. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 32714-32719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), with a retrovirus system that demonstrates almost 100% infection yield in HUVECs. Fig.1 a shows that the expression levels of the dominant negative mutants CDC42–17N, Rac1–17N, and RhoA-19N are much higher than those of their corresponding endogenous proteins. HUVECs transduced with CDC42–17N, RhoA-19N, and Rac1–17N were serum starved and subjected to migration assay as described elsewhere (11Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 13Zeng H. Sanyal S. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32714-32719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The results show that overexpression of RhoA-19N almost completely inhibits VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVEC migration. Overexpression of Rac1–17N inhibits VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVEC migration by ∼50%, whereas overexpression of CDC42–17N has no effect (Fig. 1 b). Fig. 1 a also clearly shows that the ratios of endogenous G proteins (CDC42, Rac1, and RhoA) to their corresponding overexpressed dominant negative mutants (CDC42–17N, Rac1–17N, and RhoA-19N) are similar to each other. Furthermore, overexpression of CDC42–17N and Rac1–17N was shown to inhibit the Flt-1-mediated signaling pathway in HUVECs stimulated with VPF/VEGF (12Zeng H. Zhao D. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4003-4009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Therefore, the partial inhibition of Rac1–17N on VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVEC migration is not due to the lesser expression of Rac1–17N, and the functional CDC42–17N has no effect on this response. These data indicate that three major members of the Rho family small GTPases differentially regulate VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVEC migration. It is known that VPF/VEGF stimulates KDR phosphorylation, intracellular Ca2+mobilization, and MAPK phosphorylation in the EC (22,23). Therefore, we first examined whether RhoA mediates KDR phosphorylation. Serum-starved HUVECs transduced with LacZ- or RhoA-19N-expressing viruses were stimulated with VPF/VEGF for 1, 5, and 10 min. Cellular extracts were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against KDR and immunoblotted with an antibody against phosphotyrosine. The results show that RhoA-19N has no effect on KDR phosphorylation (Fig.2 a). To examine whether RhoA mediates VPF/VEGF-induced intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, serum-starved HUVECs transduced with LacZ or RhoA-19N were stimulated with VPF/VEGF, and the intracellular calcium mobilization was monitored. The data show that overexpression of RhoA-19N has no effect on VPF/VEGF-induced calcium response (Fig. 2 b). Similarly, serum-starved HUVECs transduced with LacZ or RhoA-19N-expressing viruses were stimulated with VPF/VEGF for 1, 5, and 10 min. Cellular extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis using an antibody specifically against phosphorylated MAPK. Fig. 2 c clearly shows that MAPK was phosphorylated to the same level in HUVECs transduced with LacZ or RhoA-19N. Recently, we showed that VPF/VEGF activates CDC42 and Rac1 in HUVECs (12Zeng H. Zhao D. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4003-4009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because RhoA-19N blocks VPF/VEGF-induced HUVEC migration (Fig. 1), we examined whether RhoA can also be activated in HUVECs stimulated by VPF/VEGF. The activity of RhoA was measured by a pull-down assay using a GST·TRBD fusion protein that binds only to the GTP-bound form of RhoA (21Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). Serum-starved HUVECs were stimulated with VPF/VEGF for different lengths of time as indicated. Cellular extracts were incubated with freshly prepared GST·TRBD beads. Proteins bound to the beads were subjected to Western blot analysis using the antibodies against RhoA. Fig. 3 shows that RhoA is activated as early as 0.5 min and remains high at 5 min after VPF/VEGF treatment. To systematically study the roles of Rho family GTPases in VPF/VEGF signaling pathways, we used the recently developed receptor chimeras EGDR and EGLT in which the N-terminal domain of KDR or Flt-1, respectively, was replaced with that of EGFR to dissect the signaling pathways mediated by KDR or Flt-1 (11Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). It was previously shown that HUVECs were not responsive to EGF treatment in the experimental conditions used (11Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 12Zeng H. Zhao D. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4003-4009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As expected, in the HUVECs transduced with LacZ-expressing viruses, EGF did not activate RhoA (Fig.4 a, top panel). When serum-starved HUVECs transduced with EGDR- or EGLT-expressing viruses were stimulated with EGF for different time intervals, EGDR mediated RhoA activation in a similar time course to that in VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVECs (Fig. 4 a,middle panel). In contrast, stimulation of EGLT did not induce RhoA activation (Fig. 4 a, bottom panel). Because both CDC42 and Rac1 are activated in EGF-stimulated HUVECs transduced with EGLT (12Zeng H. Zhao D. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4003-4009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we examined whether EGDR mediates CDC42 and Rac1 activation. A pull-down assay using the GST·Pak·CRIB fusion protein, which binds only to the GTP-bound forms of CDC42 and Rac1, was used to measure the activity of CDC42 and Rac1 (24Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22731-22737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 12Zeng H. Zhao D. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4003-4009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). HUVECs transduced with LacZ or EGDR were serum starved and then stimulated with 10 ng/ml EGF for different time intervals as indicated. Cellular extracts were incubated with freshly prepared GST·Pak·CRIB beads. Proteins bound to the beads were subjected to immunoblot analysis using the antibodies against CDC42 or Rac1, respectively. Figs. 4 b shows that Rac1 was activated in EGDR/HUVECs stimulated with EGF for 0.5 and 1 min. At 5 min of EGF stimulation, no Rac1 activation was detected. This EGDR-mediated Rac1 activation is in a similar time course to that in VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVECs (12Zeng H. Zhao D. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4003-4009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, Fig. 4 c shows that EGDR cannot mediate CDC42 activation. Recently, we demonstrated that the tyrosine 951 residue of KDR, which is partially required for KDR phosphorylation, is essential for VPF/VEGF-induced migration but not proliferation (13Zeng H.

We show here that P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein functions in rodent parasite and that P. berghei sporozoites carrying the P. falciparum CS gene develop normally, are motile, invade mosquito salivary glands, and infect the vertebrate host. Region I-deficient sporozoites showed no impairment of motility or infectivity in either vector or vertebrate host.

The malaria sporozoite has the unique ability to selectively invade the salivary glands of the mosquito vector and the vertebrate host cells (1Nussenzweig V. Nussenzweig R.S. Adv. Immun. 1989; 45: 283-334Google Scholar). At this developmental stage the surface of the parasite is mainly covered by the circumsporozoite (CS) 1The abbreviations used are: CS, circumsporozoite; TSP, thrombospondin; TRAP, thrombospondin-related adhesive protein; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; UTR, untranslated repeat; WT, wild type; DHFR-TS, dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase; IF, immunofluorescence protein (2Yoshida N.

In all malaria species the CS protein shows a similar structural organization consisting of a variable central region of repeats and two highly conserved motifs, regions I and II, placed at the amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends of the molecule, respectively. Region I is based around the short amino acid motif KLKQP. This motif is identical in all malaria parasites so far described in mammals (5McCutchan T.F. Kissinger J.C. Touray M.G. Rogers M.J. Li J. Sullivan M. Braga E.M. Krettli A.U. Miller L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11889-11894Google Scholar). In the avian parasite such as Plasmodium gallinaceum the CS protein lacks region I. Region II is a 20-amino acid motif EWSXCXVTCGXG(V/I)XXRX(K/R) that shares sequence homologies to the type 1 repeat of human thrombospondin (TSP) (6Lawler J. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1635-1648Google Scholar). One to seven copies of this motif have now been found in a number of proteins involved in the complement pathway (properdin, C6, C7, C8A, C8B, and C9) as well as adhesive extracellular matrix proteins like ADAMTS, mindin, F-spondin, or SCO-spondin and micronemal proteins of apicomplexan parasites (7Goundis D.

One of these micronemal proteins, the thrombospondin-related adhesive protein (TRAP), contains a single TSP type 1 repeat and is expressed at the sporozoite stage of malaria parasites (8Robson K.J.H.

Several proteins containing a TSP type 1 motif, including TRAP have the ability to selectively recognize glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) (12Adams J.C. Tucker R.P. Dev.

Similarly, recombinant forms of CS protein, as well as synthetic peptides encompassing region II, specifically bind to highly sulfated GAGs such as heparin and heparan sulfate (11Gantt S.M.

Clavijo P. Beavis R.C. Clark G.F. Frevert U. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 168-182Google Scholar). It is intriguing that sporozoites express two distinct molecules, TRAP and CS protein, both containing a TSP type 1 repeat and having similar adhesive properties. The reasons for this are not clear. Gene disruption and biochemical evidence indicate that TRAP functions as a parasite receptor molecules and plays a crucial role in gliding, a form of substrate-dependent forward locomotion intimately linked to the process of sporozoite invasion of mosquito salivary glands and vertebrate host cells (22Sultan A.A. Thathy V. Frevert U. Robson K.J. Crisanti A. Nussenzweig V. Nussenzweig R.S. Menard R. Cell. 1997; 90: 511-522Google Scholar, 23Spaccapelo R. Naitza S. Robson K.J. Crisanti A.

The function of the CS protein is far less well established. The location on the parasite surface, the presence of the highly conserved region I and II sequences, and the adhesive property for GAGs have suggested that the CS protein ought to play an important role in the processes of sporozoite recognition and invasion of mosquito salivary glands and vertebrate host cells (17Pancake S.J. Holt G.D. Mellouk S. Hoffman S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1351-1357Google Scholar, 18Frevert U. Sinnis P. Cerami C. Shreffler W. Takacs B. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp.

Disruption of the CS gene did not add to the knowledge on the CS protein as receptor in the sporozoites. Plasmodium berghei parasites in which the CS gene has been targeted fail to develop into mature oocysts, and very few sporozoites if any are produced (28Menard R. Sultan A.A. Cortes C. Altszuler R. van Dijk M.R. Janse C.J. Waters A.P. Nussenzweig R.S. Nussenzweig V. Nature. 1997; 385: 336-340Google Scholar). The elucidation of the function of CS protein and its conserved motifs, regions I and II, would be of great importance for a better understanding of sporozoite interactions with mosquito salivary glands and vertebrate host cells. This information will also be useful to unravel functional relationships between TRAP and CS protein. To examine the role of CS protein and its conserved motifs, we have generated transgenic P. berghei parasites in which the endogenous CS protein gene (PbCS) has been replaced with either the P. falciparum CS protein gene (PfCS) or with versions of PfCS without either region I or II. These parasites were studied throughout development in the mosquito as well as for their ability to infect mice. The targeting constructs pPfCSP, pPfCSP(RI−), and PfCSP(RII−) used in this study contained the following structural elements: (i) a 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of the PbCS gene encompassing nucleotides 1–1130 immediately upstream of the PbCS start codon; (ii) the WT or mutated versions of PfCS coding sequence (1660 bp) from Plasmodium falciparum Wellcome strain linked to 250 nucleotides of its 3′-UTR; and (iii) the 3′-UTR sequence of PbCS gene encompassing nucleotides 1–1150 downstream of its stop codon in which the DHFR-TS transcription unit (5400 bp) was inserted at its HindIII site (+302) (29Waters A.P. Thomas A.W. van Dijk M.R. Janse C.J. Methods. 1997; 13: 134-147Google Scholar). Deletions of region I (KLKQP) and region II (WSPCSVTCGNGIQVRIK) were introduced in the PfCS coding sequence by site-directed mutagenesis (Sculptor in vitro mutagenesis kit, AmershamBiosciences) and verified by sequence analysis. The P. berghei ANKA strain (clone 2.34) was transformed in electroporation experiments by using 50–70 μg of a DNA insert. Plasmid DNA was digested to release the targeting inserts (∼9.2 kb) from the plasmid backbone and purified by gel electrophoresis and phenol/chloroform extraction. Purified schizonts were transformed with the constructs pPfCSP, pPfCSP(RI−), and pPfCSP(RII−) using a Bio-Rad electroporator set at 1.1 kV and 25 microfarads and subsequently injected intravenously in phenylhydrazine (to increase reticulocyte production)-treated Wistar rats as described previously (29Waters A.P. Thomas A.W. van Dijk M.R. Janse C.J. Methods. 1997; 13: 134-147Google Scholar). Pyrimethamine-resistant parasites were selected in the recipient rats and BALB/c mice as described previously (29Waters A.P. Thomas A.W. van Dijk M.R. Janse C.J. Methods. 1997; 13: 134-147Google Scholar) and cloned in BALB/c mice by limiting dilution. Genomic DNA was isolated from parasites as previously described (29Waters A.P. Thomas A.W. van Dijk M.R. Janse C.J. Methods. 1997; 13: 134-147Google Scholar). For Southern blot analysis 5 μg of genomic DNA was digested with EcoRV, separated on agarose gel, and blotted onto a nylon Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The following DNA fragments were used as probes: (a) a 1.1-kb 5′-UTR sequence of PbCSamplified using the primers 5′-UTR1CS (TTT AAA TAT ATG CGT GTA TAT ATA G) and 5′-UTR2CS (CGC TTT TAC TTT GTC CAG GTA TTA TGC); (b) a-666 bp fragment amplified from PbCS coding sequence with the primers CSFor81 (CCA GGA TAT GGA CAA AAT AAA) and CSRev83 (ATT GTT ATT ACC ACC TGG C); (c) a 510-bp fragment amplified fromPfCS with the primers PFCS3 (GGA CAA GGT CAC AAT ATG CC) and PFCS5 (CAT ATA TAT TTC TAC AAT TAA TCG); (d) a 1.1-kb fragment amplified from the 3′-UTR sequence of PbCS gene with the primers 3′-UTR1CS (ATA AAC ATT ACG CAT GAT TAT A) and 3′-UTR2CS (GAG TAC TCA CGA ATC CGA AAT AAG); and (e) a 520-bp fragment amplified from the DHFR-TS gene with the primers TgFor123 (AGA GGG GCA TCG GCA TCA AC) and TgRev124 (TTG AAA GAA TGT CAT CTC CG). All hybridization experiments were carried out as described (24Wengelnik K. Spaccapelo R. Naitza S. Robson K.J. Janse C.J. Bistoni F. Waters A.P. Crisanti A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5195-5204Google Scholar). Parasite chromosomes were separated by pulse-field gel electrophoresis using a CHEF DRIII apparatus (Bio-Rad) set at 60–600 s and 4 V/cm and run for 48 h. The gel was blotted and hybridized with probes b and c to detect PbCS and PfCSsequences. Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes (strain sd 500) were fed for 1 h on WT and transgenic infected Balb/c mice having a parasitemia ranging from 6 to 7%. Mosquitoes were dissected at day 8, 14, and 21 post infection and processed to reveal the presence of oocysts and sporozoites in the guts and salivary glands. The dissection procedures and parasite counts were carried out in RPMI 1640 medium without serum. Increasing numbers of WT and transgenic salivary gland and gut sporozoites were resuspended in RPMI and injected intravenously in the tail vein of naı̈ve C57BL/6 (minimum age of 6 weeks). At regular time intervals (12 h) after sporozoite injection (for up to day 15), blood samples were withdrawn from the tail of injected animals and analyzed on Giemsa-stained thin smears to reveal the presence of parasites. The pre-patent period was assessed by determining the number of days between sporozoite injection, and the time when at least three to five parasites could be detected by analyzing a minimum of 10,000 erythrocytes on Giemsa-stained blood smears. Freshly dissected 21-day post-infection oocyst sporozoites resuspended in RPMI were spotted onto microscope multiwell slides. Sporozoites were incubated for 30 min either at room temperature or at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation time the excess of medium was removed, and slides were air-dried and kept at −20 °C. For immunofluorescence (IF) analysis the parasite samples were fixed in 1% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Nonspecific binding was prevented by treating the slides for 30 min with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Triton X-100. Sporozoites were incubated for 1 h with either the monoclonal antibody 7E4 directed against PbTRAP (24Wengelnik K. Spaccapelo R. Naitza S. Robson K.J. Janse C.J. Bistoni F. Waters A.P. Crisanti A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5195-5204Google Scholar) or monoclonal antibody 3D11 directed against PbCS (2Yoshida N. Nussenzweig R.S. Potocnjak P. Nussenzweig V. Aikawa M. Science. 1980; 207: 71-73Google Scholar) or the rabbit serum NANP raised against a fusion protein between PfCS and PMMSA (30Holder A.A. Lockyer M.J. Hardy G.W. Parasitology. 1988; 97: 373-382Google Scholar). The slides were subsequently incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulins, Becton Dickinson). IF analysis was carried out by using a Leica TCS SP 2 confocal microscope. We have designed DNA constructs to achieve the deletion of the endogenous PbCS, the insertion of wild type (WT) or mutated PfCS versions, and the insertion of the selectable marker transcription unit, in a single transformation event. This strategy has several advantages. It generates non-reversible molecular events in contrast to gene targeting mediated by single crossover homologous recombination (22Sultan A.A. Thathy V. Frevert U. Robson K.J. Crisanti A. Nussenzweig V. Nussenzweig R.S. Menard R. Cell. 1997; 90: 511-522Google Scholar) and overcomes the parasite repair mechanism that has been shown in P. berghei to correct small mutations within the targeted gene with WT sequences (31Nunes A. Thathy V. Bruderer T. Sultan A.A. Nussenzweig R.S. Menard R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2895-2902Google Scholar). The replacement of the endogenous CS protein gene with a largely divergent homologous gene allows the structure-function analysis to be focused on the conserved motifs, thus facilitating the study of the transgenic parasites carrying a deletion of either region I or II. Moreover, the detection of the PfCS protein in P. berghei sporozoites offers the opportunity to analyze the expression of the replaced gene in single sporozoites. The construct pPfCSP contained the entire PfCS coding sequence, whereas the constructs pPfCSP(RI−) and pPfCSP(RII−) carried a PfCS sequence without region I or II, respectively (Fig.1 A). Transformation, selection, and cloning experiments (24Wengelnik K. Spaccapelo R. Naitza S. Robson K.J. Janse C.J. Bistoni F. Waters A.P. Crisanti A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5195-5204Google Scholar, 29Waters A.P. Thomas A.W. van Dijk M.R. Janse C.J. Methods. 1997; 13: 134-147Google Scholar) yielded the transgenic parasite clones CSP-9 (replacement with PfCS), CSP(RI−)-6 (replacement with PfCS without region I) and CSP(RII−)-7 (replacement withPfCS without region II). Southern blot analysis demonstrated that the three targeting constructs correctly integrated in the transgenic parasites thereby placing the PfCS coding sequences under the control of the endogenous PbCSregulatory sequences and directing the downstream insertion of the selectable marker DHFR-TS (Fig. 1 B). Probe a, encompassing 1.1 kb of the 5′-UTR of PbCS, hybridized with a single band of 4.2 kb in the digest of WT parasites in agreement with the predicted position of the EcoRV sites in the PbCS locus. The same probe hybridized with a single band of about 4.8 kb in theEcoRV digest of the transgenic parasites. The size shift is due to the insertion of PfCS coding sequence and its 3′-UTR that together exceeded the size of the endogenous PbCS gene by 560 nucleotides. This result was confirmed by the observation that probe b, encompassing the coding sequence of PbCS, hybridized with a single band of 4.2 kb in the WT digest but failed to show any reactivity with the DNA of the transgenic parasites. Probe c, encompassing the coding sequence of PfCS, hybridized only with a 4.8-kb band in the transgenic parasite digests. The hybridization pattern of probe d, encompassing the coding sequence of DHFR-TS, and probe e, encompassing the 3′-UTR of PbCS, indicated that the DHFR-TS transcription unit had correctly integrated in CSP-9, CSP(RI−)-6, and CSP(RII−)-7 (Fig.1 B). Chromosome blots hybridized with probes b and c confirmed that, in the transgenic parasites, the PfCS coding sequences had selectively replaced the endogenous PbCS gene on chromosome 4 (Fig. 1 C). The integrity of the inserted DNA was confirmed by PCR and sequence analysis (data not shown). Blood stage parasites from CSP-9, CSP(RI−)-6, and CSP(RII−)-7 replicated normally in mice and generated gametocytes that developed into fertile gametes and morphologically normal ookinetes (data not shown). A. stephensi mosquitoes were fed on mice infected with these three different transgenic parasites. The development of the parasite in the mosquito was monitored starting from day 8 post infection, examining the oocyst where the expression of CS is first detected. Sporozoite-containing oocysts were detected in the gut at day 14 post infection (Fig.2 A). In four independent experiments CSP-9, CSP(RI−)-6, and CSP(RII−)-7 generated an average of 78, 104, and 67 oocysts per gut, respectively, values that were very similar to those observed for WT P. berghei parasites (TableI). This indicates that, unlike aCS knock-out where no sporozoites were detected in oocysts (28Menard R. Sultan A.A. Cortes C. Altszuler R. van Dijk M.R. Janse C.J. Waters A.P. Nussenzweig R.S. Nussenzweig V. Nature. 1997; 385: 336-340Google Scholar), parasite development in the gut was not affected by the replacement with PfCS gene or with the variants without regions I or II. Compared with WT parasites, clones CSP-9 and CSP(RI−)-6 showed a 10- to 16-fold reduction in the number of salivary gland sporozoites, whereas a 290-fold reduction was observed with CSP(RII−)-7 parasites (Table I). P. falciparum and P. berghei WT sporozoites infected equally well the salivary glands of the mosquitoes utilized in this study (data not shown) thus arguing against the possibility that the reduced infectivity of the transgenic sporozoites is due to a salivary gland refractoriness of our laboratory mosquito strain for the selectedPfCS coding sequence. The infectivity of CSP-9 sporozoites was high enough to assess the effect of the deletion of regions I and II. Compared with CSP-9 and CSP(RI−)-6, CSP(RII−)-7 showed a greater than 95% reduction in the number of salivary gland sporozoites; statistical analysis indicated that such a difference is significant (p < 0.05). We further investigated the phenotype of the transgenic sporozoites by analyzing the expression of PfCS protein by immunofluorescence (IF) and by assessing their ability to glide on glass surfaces, which reflects their motility status. This analysis demonstrated an initial normal location of the CS protein in all transgenic parasites. Freshly dissected gut sporozoites from each of the transgenic clones showed a uniform and bright surface staining when incubated with an antiserum against PfCS protein (data not shown). Following incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, more than 50% of CSP-9 and CSP(RI−)-6 gut sporozoites (21 days post infection) showed CS protein-reactive trails from gliding on a glass surface (Fig. 2 B). The shape of the trails, which consist of the immunoreactive CS material, indicated that about 10% of the sporozoites were able to form one or more complete loops, whereas the rest of the sporozoites left trails of variable shape and length. The frequencies of motile parasites were similar for WT, CSP-9, and CSP(RI−)-6 sporozoites and in agreement with previous reports on the motility of gut sporozoites (14Robson K.J.H. Frevert U. Reckmann I. Cowan G. Beier J. Scragg I.G. Takehara K. Bishop D.H.L. Pradel G. Sinden R.E. Saccheo S. Müller H.M. Crisanti A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3883-3894Google Scholar). In contrast, CSP(RII−)-7 sporozoites did not show any form of gliding motility upon temperature switch to 37 °C. At this temperature the uniform PfCS protein surface staining observed at 25 °C was replaced by clumps of immunoreactive material either outside the parasite body or in proximity to its surface (Fig.2 B). The inability of CSP(RII−)-7 sporozoites to glide was analyzed further by IF to study the expression and the location of TRAP, a micronemal parasite-encoded molecule that is implicated in sporozoite motility (22Sultan A.A. Thathy V. Frevert U. Robson K.J. Crisanti A. Nussenzweig V. Nussenzweig R.S. Menard R. Cell. 1997; 90: 511-522Google Scholar, 23Spaccapelo R. Naitza S. Robson K.J. Crisanti A.

TRAP expression was not altered in CSP(RII−)-7 sporozoites, a typical TRAP staining pattern with antibody-reactive material distributed within the cytoplasm both anterior and posterior to the nucleus (14Robson K.J.H. Frevert U. Reckmann I. Cowan G. Beier J. Scragg I.G. Takehara K. Bishop D.H.L. Pradel G. Sinden R.E. Saccheo S. Müller H.M. Crisanti A.

Open table in a new tab Values represent the mean ± S.E. of four different independent experiments, each with a minimum of 50 mosquitoes. The role of regions I and II for parasite infectivity of the mammalian host was investigated following intravenous injection into naı̈ve C57BL/6 mice of either salivary gland or gut sporozoites both collected at day 21 post infection. In addition, infected mosquitoes carrying the different transgenic parasites were allowed to feed on naı̈ve mice. A blood stage infection was initiated in a substantial fraction of the mice by as few as 100 WT salivary gland sporozoites (Table II), whereas with 1000 sporozoites all mice were infected. When 5000 sporozoites were inoculated, the number of days between injection of sporozoites and the first appearance of the parasites in the blood (the pre-patent period), decreased from 5.0 to 3.5 days. Identical rates of infection and pre-patent periods were observed by injecting similar numbers of CSP-9 and CSP(RI−)-6 salivary gland sporozoites (Table II). CSP(RII−)-7 sporozoites always failed to infect the mice (Table II). The infectivity of gut sporozoites was much less efficient than salivary gland sporozoites. This observation is in agreement with earlier reports showing that gut sporozoites are less infective than salivary gland sporozoites (32Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1975; 61: 43-50Google Scholar). Although a fraction of mice was infected with WT, CSP-9, and CSP(RI−)-6 gut sporozoites, the region II-deleted parasites CSP(RII−)-7 always failed to infect the mice even after the injection of 1 million sporozoites (Table III). Similarly, CSP(RII−)-7-infected mosquitoes failed to initiate infection in the mice after blood feeding. These findings clearly indicate that, although the deletion of region I of CS protein does not impair sporozoite infectivity, region II has a critical role in this process.Table IIInfectivity of salivary gland sporozoitesParasiteSporozoites injectedMice infectedPre-patent periodaPre-patent period is the number of days between injection and first appearance of the parasites in the peripheral blood.WT1002/35.010007/73.830002/23.550004/43.5CSP-91003/75.010009/93.830002/23.550004/43.5CSP(RI−)-61003/85.010008/83.730002/24.050004/43.5CSP(RII−)-71000/410000/850000/2a Pre-patent period is the number of days between injection and first appearance of the parasites in the peripheral blood.

Open table in a new tab Our data have important implications for understanding the function of the CS protein and its domains in the process of sporozoite motility and infectivity. All transgenic parasite lines developed normally to the oocyst stage. CSP-9 sporozoites infected mosquito salivary glands less efficiently than WT P. bergheisporozoites. Possibly the sequence changes introduced outside the conserved region I and II by replacing PbCS withPfCS could have reduced the ability of the PfCS protein to function optimally within the P. berghei background during sporozoite invasion of A. stephensi salivary glands. The removal of region I did not modify CSP(RI−)-6 sporozoite motility and infectivity for mosquito salivary gland compared with CSP-9 parasites. This last finding would rule out a role of this motif in the process of sporozoite recognition of a mosquito salivary gland ligand. Such a conclusion is in agreement with the notion that the CS protein expressed by CSP(RI−)-6 sporozoites has a structural organization similar to the P. gallinaceum CS protein (5McCutchan T.F. Kissinger J.C. Touray M.G. Rogers M.J. Li J. Sullivan M. Braga E.M. Krettli A.U. Miller L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11889-11894Google Scholar). The absence of region I in P. gallinaceum CS protein does not affect parasite development into oocyst and sporozoite invasion of salivary glands. The removal of region II almost abolished the ability of sporozoites to infect salivary glands. A role of region II in the process of CS protein recognition of salivary gland ligands could not be inferred on the basis of these findings. The deletion of this sequence also abolished sporozoite gliding thus making it difficult to assess whether the impairment of salivary gland invasion was the direct consequence of disrupting a crucial receptor-ligand interaction or indirectly due to the lack of motility. CSP(RII−)-7 sporozoites did not glide upon temperature switch to 37 °C as indicated by the lack of CS protein trails and the clumps of CS-reactive material along the surface and outside the parasite body. In these sporozoites the flow of CS protein from the apical complex to the caudal end of the parasite appeared to be replaced by a spatial, uncoordinated capping process. The phenotype of CSP(RII−)-7 sporozoites sheds new light on the composition and the function of the sporozoite locomotion machinery. TRAP has been previously hypothesized to function in the process of sporozoite motility by linking host ligands bound to its adhesive domains (TSP type 1 repeat sequence and A domain) with the parasite actin-myosin motor (23Spaccapelo R. Naitza S. Robson K.J. Crisanti A. Lancet. 1997; 350: 335Google Scholar, 24Wengelnik K. Spaccapelo R. Naitza S. Robson K.J. Janse C.J. Bistoni F. Waters A.P. Crisanti A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5195-5204Google Scholar, 33Morrissette N.S. Sibley L.D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 21-38Google Scholar). Notably, TRAP knock-outP. berghei sporozoites do not move (22Sultan A.A. Thathy V. Frevert U. Robson K.J. Crisanti A. Nussenzweig V. Nussenzweig R.S. Menard R. Cell. 1997; 90: 511-522Google Scholar). This phenotype is identical to that of CSP(RII−)-7 sporozoites thus indicating that TRAP alone is necessary but not sufficient for sporozoite motility. Our findings now demonstrate that for sporozoites to move TRAP must be functionally coupled to a CS protein containing an intact region II. This could be achieved through a direct interaction or be mediated by additional parasite molecular partners. The deletion of region II in the CS protein could impair sporozoite motility either by disrupting these interactions or by impairing the ability of the CS protein to directly mediate attachment of the sporozoites to host ligands. The disruption of region II also abolished sporozoite infectivity for the vertebrate host as shown by the observation that CSP(RII−)-7 sporozoites always failed to infect the mice (Table II). CSP-9 and CSP(RI−)-6 sporozoites infected C57BL/6 mice equally well as the parental WT parasites thus demonstrating that the PfCS protein is able to complement the activity of the endogenousP. berghei CS protein very efficiently. The disruption of region I did not impair sporozoite infectivity in the vertebrate host. This was a surprise, because region I is present in the CS protein of mammalian parasite and is absent in avian parasites. Sporozoites of mammalian parasites infect host hepatocytes, whereas avian parasites selectively invade and develop inside the macrophages. This correlation between CS protein structure and sporozoite infectivity for different host cell types has suggested a role of region I in sporozoite recognition and entry of vertebrate hepatocytes. If this were the case our findings indicate that this function can be complemented by region II at least in the parasite-vertebrate host combination utilized in this study. This would be in agreement with previous reports showing that the ligand of region I could be a GAG-related molecule sharing structural similarities with the ligand of region II (21Ying P.

The binding affinities and profiles were similar for a number of the 2,2′-bipyridine and 1,10-phenanthroline analogs in complex with Zn(II) in the MC1 and MC4 receptors.

The melanocortins, adrenocorticotropic hormone and α-, β-, and γ-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), 1The abbreviations used are: α-MSH, α-melanocortin stimulating hormone; MC receptor, melanocortin receptor; NDP-α-MSH, [Nle4-D(Phe)7]-α-melanocortin stimulating hormone; TM, transmembrane segment 1The abbreviations used are: α-MSH, α-melanocortin stimulating hormone; MC receptor, melanocortin receptor; NDP-α-MSH, [Nle4-D(Phe)7]-α-melanocortin stimulating hormone; TM, transmembrane segment are all derived from the precursor protein pro-opiomelanocortin. They are peptide hormones and neuropeptides, which exert their function through the five different members of the melanocortin receptor MC family, MC1 to MC5. These receptors are widely distributed both in the periphery and in the central nervous system. The physiological functions of the receptors cover a correspondingly diverse spectrum ranging from regulation of pigmentation (MC1 receptor), adrenal cortical steroidogenesis (MC2/adrenocorticotropic hormone receptor), and exocrine secretion (MC5 receptor) to energy homeostasis, appetite regulation, and penile erection (MC3 and -4 receptors) (1Wikberg J.E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 375: 295-310Google Scholar, 2Marks D.L. Cone R.D. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2001; 56: 359-375Google Scholar). The focus on this receptor family has greatly increased following the discovery of the involvement of initially the MC4 receptor and later the MC3 receptors in appetite regulation and metabolic control (3Robinson S.W.

Mice with a genetically disrupted MC4 receptor display an obese phenotype characterized by excessively increased food intake and a decreased metabolic rate (4Huszar D. Lynch C.A. Fairchild-Huntress V. Dunmore J.H. Fang Q. Berkemeier L.R. Gu W. Kesterson R.A. Boston B.A. Cone R.D. Smith F.J. Campfield L.A. Burn P. Lee F. Cell. 1997; 88: 131-141Google Scholar,8Ste M.L. Miura G.I. Marsh D.J. Yagaloff K. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12339-12344Google Scholar). A similar phenomenon of pathological obesity is seen in humans with inactivating mutations of the MC4 receptor (9Farooqi I.S. Yeo G.S. Keogh J.M. Aminian S. Jebb S.A. Butler G. Cheetham T. O'Rahilly S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 271-279Google Scholar, 10Vaisse C. Clement K. Durand E. Hercberg S. Guy-Grand B. Froguel P. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 253-262Google Scholar). Both observations indicate that the MC4 receptor could be a useful target in the treatment of obesity and type II diabetes and, that agonists for this receptor would be needed. Importantly, intra-cerebrospinal injection of peptide agonists for the melanocortin receptors does reduce obesity in animal models, an effect that was reversible by co-injection of the corresponding antagonists (11Fan W. Boston B.A. Kesterson R.A. Hruby V.J. Cone R.D. Nature. 1997; 385: 165-168Google Scholar). However, only very recently have the first high potency non-peptide agonists been described for the melanocortin receptors (12Van der Ploeg L.H. Martin W.J. Howard A.D. Nargund R.P. Austin C.P. Guan X. Drisko J. Cashen D. Sebhat I. Patchett A.A. Figueroa D.J. DiLella A.G. Connolly B.M. Weinberg D.H. Tan C.P. Palyha O.C. Pong S.S. MacNeil T. Rosenblum C. Vongs A. Tang R. Yu H. Sailer A.W.

Metal ions are required for the function of numerous proteins. Zn(II) is known to serve as a part of the active site in, for example metalloenzymes, and to act as a stabilizer of protein structure, for example in the Zn(II) finger binding motif of transcription factors. More recently it has been discovered that zinc ions also bind with high affinity to and modulate the function of a number of membrane proteins, particularly in neural tissues. This has been shown to be the case for ion channels such as the glutaminergicN-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (13Hollmann M. Boulter J. Maron C. Beasley L. Sullivan J. Pecht G. Heinemann S. Neuron. 1993; 10: 943-954Google Scholar, 14Westbrook G.L. Mayer M.L. Nature. 1987; 328: 640-643Google Scholar, 15Peters S. Koh J. Choi D.W. Science. 1987; 236: 589-593Google Scholar); for membrane transporters such as the dopaminergic and glutaminergic transporter (16Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Google Scholar, 17Vandenberg R.J. Mitrovic A.D. Johnston G.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 189-196Google Scholar); and for 7TM receptors such as the tachykinin NK3 receptor, the β2-adrenergic receptor, and the galanin receptor (18Rosenkilde M.M. Lucibello M. Holst B. Schwartz T.W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 35-40Google Scholar, 19Katz A. Wu D. Simon M.I. Nature. 1992; 360: 686-689Google Scholar, 20Swaminath G. Steenhuis J. Kobilka B. Lee T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 65-72Google Scholar). Zn(II) is present in high concentrations in several regions of the brain, where it is stored in synaptic vesicles of the nerve terminals and is co-released with neurotransmitters in micromolar concentrations to the synaptic gap upon neuronal activation (21Smart T.G. Xie X. Krishek B.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 1994; 42: 393Google Scholar,22Assaf S.Y. Chung S.H. Nature. 1984; 308: 734-736Google Scholar). In 7TM receptors both antagonist and agonist binding sites have been re-engineered into metal-ion sites, where free metal ions and metal ions in complex with small organic metal-ion chelators have been demonstrated to mimic the action of the antagonist or of the agonist, respectively (23Elling C.E. Nielsen S.M. Schwartz T.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 74-77Google Scholar, 24Holst B. Elling C.E. Schwartz T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 263-270Google Scholar, 25Elling C.E. Thirstrup K. Holst B. Schwartz T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12322-12327Google Scholar). Because the geometry of metal-ion binding sites in general is very well characterized in respect of distance and angles, such metal-ion sites have provided important information about the structure and potential activation mechanism of 7TM receptors (23Elling C.E. Nielsen S.M. Schwartz T.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 74-77Google Scholar,25Elling C.E. Thirstrup K. Holst B. Schwartz T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12322-12327Google Scholar, 26Thirstrup K.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6213-6219Google Scholar) and recently of 12TM transporter molecules (16Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Google Scholar, 28Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Litman T. Gether U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 2002; 99: 1683-1688Google Scholar). The antagonistic metal-ion sites provide important pieces of structural information due to the distance constraints such sites impose upon the molecular models of the 7TM receptors (27Elling C.E. Schwartz T.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6213-6219Google Scholar), for which only a single high resolution x-ray structure of the inactive form is otherwise available (29Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le T.I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Google Scholar). The few agonistic metal-ion sites, which as yet have been described, provide the first distance constraints in the active conformation of 7TM receptors. For example, introduction of a metal-ion binding site that constrained the third and the seventh transmembrane segment in a well-defined conformation result in 25% partial agonism (24Holst B. Elling C.E. Schwartz T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 263-270Google Scholar, 25Elling C.E. Thirstrup K. Holst B. Schwartz T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12322-12327Google Scholar). In the present study we find that both the MC1 receptor and the MC4 receptor possess endogenous metal-ion sites through which Zn(II) can function both as a partial agonist and as an enhancer or potentiator for the peptide agonists (Fig. 1). The high affinity of the metal-ion site suggests that the metal ion-induced modulation of the endogenous melanocortin receptor activity is of physiological relevance. Moreover, not only free Zn(II) but also the metal ion in complex with small organic, hydrophobic chelators could activate the MC receptors even with higher efficacy and potency than the free metal ion, suggesting a possible route for the design of novel modulating agents for this receptor family. The peptides α-MSH and NDP-α-MSH were purchased from Peninsula (St. Helens, Merseyside, UK). The metal ion chelators 2,2′-bipyridine, 1,10-phenanthroline, 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (1a), 5-phenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (1b), 5-chloro-1,10-phenanthroline (1c), 2,9-dimethanol-1,10-phenanthroline (1e), and 2,9-bis(trichloromethyl)-1,10-phenanthroline (1f) were all obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). 5-Amino-1,10-phenanthroline was obtained from Polysciences Europe GmbH (Eppelheim, Germany), whereas the three 2,2′-bipyridine analogs were kindly donated from 7TM Pharma A/S (Copenhagen, Denmark). The Zn(II)-chelator complexes were prepared by dissolving the chelator compounds either in ethanol or in Me2SO and mixing with aqueous solutions of ZnCl2 to a final molar ratio of 3:1 in the case of 1,10-phenanthroline and 2,2′-bipyridine and 2:1 for the rest of the compounds. The human MC4 receptor cDNA was cloned by PCR from brain cDNA library, whereas the mouse MC1 receptor was kindly provided by Dr. Roger Cone (Vollum Institute, Portland, OR). The cDNA were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA1 or pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Mutations were constructed by PCR using the overlap expression method (30Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 61-68Google Scholar). The PCR products were digested with appropriate restriction endonucleases, purified, and cloned into the pcDNA3. All PCR experiments were performed using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. All mutations were verified by restriction endonuclease mapping and subsequent DNA sequence analysis using an ABI 310 automated sequencer. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 1885 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 0.01 mg/ml gentamicin. The expression plasmids containing the cDNAs encoding the wild-type or the mutated receptors were transiently expressed after transfection according to the calcium phosphate precipitation method (31Gether U. Johansen T.E. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7893-7898Google Scholar), and assays were performed 48 h after transfection. The malignant melanoma cell line COLO 829 was grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine adjusted to contain 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 10 mmHEPES, 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10% fetal bovine serum. One day after transfection, the cells were transferred and seeded in multiwell plates for assay. The number of cells plated per well was chosen so as to obtain 5–10% binding of the radioligand added. Two days after transfection the cells were assayed in competition binding assays using 125I-NDP-α-MSH as a tracer. Radioligand was bound in a buffer composed of 0.5 ml of 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, supplemented with 1 mmCaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and displaced in a dose-dependent manner by unlabeled ligands. The assay was performed in duplicate for 3 h at 25 °C and stopped by washing twice in the buffer. Cell-associated, receptor-bound radioligands were determined by the addition of lysis buffer (48% urea, 2% Nonidet P-40 in 3 m acetic acid). The concentration of radioligands in the assay corresponds to a final concentration of ∼20 pm. The metal ion-chelating compounds were added in a 2-fold molar excess to ensure that no free metal ion was present. COS-7 cells (2.5 × 105 cells per well) or the melanoma cell line (2 × 105 cells per well) were incubated for 24 h with 2 μCi of [3H]adenine (Amersham Biosciences, TRK 311) in 1 ml of medium. Cells were washed twice and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in 1 ml of freshly prepared binding buffer supplemented with 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine (Sigma, I5879), 40 μg/ml bacitracin, and various concentrations of ligands or 50 μm forskolin. After incubation, cells were placed on ice, medium was removed, and cells were lysed with 1 ml of 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, supplemented with 0.1 mm cAMP and 0.1 mm ATP for 30 min. The lysis mixtures were loaded onto a Dowex 50W-X4 (Bio-Rad, 142–1351) column (Bio-Rad, poly-prep columns, 731–1550), which was washed with 2 ml of water and placed onto the top of alumina columns (Sigma, A9003) and washed again with 10 ml of water. The columns were eluted with 6 ml of 0.1 m imidazole (Sigma, I0125) into 15 ml of scintillation fluid (Highsafe III). Columns were re-used up to 10 times. Dowex columns were regenerated by adding 10 ml of 2 n HCl followed by 10 ml of water; the alumina columns were regenerated by adding 2 ml of 1 mimidazole, 10 ml of 0.1 m imidazole, and finally 5 ml of water. Determinations were made in triplicates. IC50 and EC50 values were determined by non-linear regression using the Prism 3.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Values of the dissociation and inhibition constants (K d and K i) were estimated from competition binding experiments using the equation,K d = IC50 − L andK i = IC50/(1 +L/K d), where L is the concentration of the radioactive ligand. For determination of statistical significant correlation, the Spearman test was applied. Competition binding studies were performed for both the MC1 and MC4 receptors in transiently transfected COS7 cells using 125I-NDP-α-MSH as radioligand. Zn(II) displaced the 125I-NDP-α-MSH with an IC50 value of 13 μm in the MC1 receptor and 19 μm in the MC4 receptor, corresponding to the affinity observed for example in bis-His metal-ion sites, previously engineered in 7TM receptors (Fig. 2 and Table I) (23Elling C.E. Nielsen S.M. Schwartz T.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 74-77Google Scholar, 26Thirstrup K. Elling C.E. Hjorth S.A. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7875-7878Google Scholar). However, in the dose-response experiments Zn(II) only displaced ∼50% of the maximally bound 125I-NDP-α-MSH, whereas the peptide ligands α-MSH and NDP-α-MSH displaced the radioligand fully,i.e. down to ∼5% unspecific binding (Fig. 2). In receptors with artificially engineered metal-ion binding sites, for example in the NK1 receptor and the kappa opioid receptor, Zn(II) has previously been shown to fully displace the employed radioligands (23Elling C.E. Nielsen S.M. Schwartz T.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 74-77Google Scholar,26Thirstrup K. Elling C.E. Hjorth S.A. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7875-7878Google Scholar, 27Elling C.E. Schwartz T.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6213-6219Google Scholar). In the MC1 and the MC4 receptors, Zn(II) in complex with, for example, the metal-ion chelator 1c (see below) also displaced the radioligand fully (Fig. 2). Cu(II) competed for radioligand binding with an affinity at 66 μm for the MC1 receptor and 93 μm for the MC4 receptor, i.e. in both cases ∼5-fold lower affinity than Zn(II).Table ILigand affinities in the MC1 and MC4 receptorsK d/K iMCI receptor(n)MC4 receptor(n)μm ± S.E.μm ± S.E.α-MSH0.0050 ± 0.0004(6)0.0072 ± 0.001(6)NDP-α-MSH0.0021 ± 0.0001(7)0.0046 ± 0.001(7)Zn(II)13 ± 3(7)19 ± 4(7)Zn[Phe]24 ± 4(3)33 ± 5(3)Zn[1a]1.4 ± 0.2(3)1.2 ± 0.1(3)Zn[1b]1.2 ± 0.1(3)1.4 ± 0.2(3)Zn[1c]7.3 ± 0.3(3)5.3 ± 1.0(3)Zn[1d]9.7 ± 1.7(3)6.9 ± 0.4(3)Zn[1e]8.9 ± 2.5(3)10 ± 3(3)Zn[1f]20 ± 7(3)12 ± 1(3)Zn[Dip]22 ± 7(3)22 ± 7(3)Zn[2a]14 ± 1(3)18 ± 5(3)Zn[2b]7.0 ± 3.1(3)9.5 ± 2.5(3)Zn[2c]4.5 ± 1.1(3)9.9 ± 4.1(3)K d and K i values from receptor competition binding assays for peptide ligands, Zn(II) and Zn(II)-chelator complexes in the MC1 and MC4 receptors.

In a melanoma cell line expressing the human MC1 receptor, Zn(II) stimulated cAMP production with an efficacy similar to that of MSH and with a potency of 79 μm. However, to ensure that the effect of Zn(II) was in fact mediated through the MC receptor, the further functional characterization was performed in transiently transfected COS7 cells (Fig. 3). Here, Zn(II) acted as a partial agonist both in cells transfected with the MC1 receptor and the MC4 receptor. On the MC1 receptor, Zn(II) had an efficacy of ∼50% as compared with α-MSH (Fig.4 A), whereas on the MC4 receptor Zn(II) showed only 20% efficacy compared with α-MSH (Fig.4 B). The potency of Zn(II) was 11 and 13 μmfor the MC1 and the MC4 receptors, respectively (EC50values), which corresponds to the affinity for Zn(II) determined in the competition binding experiments. In contrast, Cu(II) had no specific stimulatory effect on either the MC1 or the MC4 receptor. In mock transfected cells Zn(II) only showed a minimal stimulatory effect and only at very high concentration (Fig. 4 B). In cells transfected with two other Gαs-coupled receptors the β2-adrenergic and the V2 receptor Zn(II) had no stimulatory effect.Figure 4cAMP accumulation in response to Zn(II) in COS7 cells transiently transfected with the MC1 or MC4 receptors. A and B, dose-response curves for Zn(II) (squares) alone in the MC1- and MC4-transfected cells and for comparison the response observed in mock transfected cells is shown in B (triangles). In C andD are shown dose-response curves for Zn(II) administrated together with a sub-maximal dose of a full agonist for the MC1 receptor α-MSH (10−6m) and for the MC4 receptor NDP-α-MSH (10−8m). Data are mean ± S.E. from three to seven independent experiments made in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) According to basic pharmacological theory (32Kenakin T.P. Pharmacologic Analysis of Drug-Receptor Interactions. Raven Press, New York1993Google Scholar), a partial agonist should behave as an antagonist of the full agonist and dose-dependently bring the cAMP turnover down to the level observed with maximal occupancy of the partial agonist alone,i.e. Zn(II). However, the Zn(II)-mediated inhibition of the agonist-induced cAMP accumulation was in fact biphasic. As shown in Fig. 4 C, Zn(II) in concentrations from 1 to 10 μm inhibited the α-MSH-induced cAMP stimulation on the MC1 receptor down to ∼60% of the α-MSH response. However, at higher concentrations of zinc ions an increase in the cAMP accumulation to ∼160% of the maximal α-MSH response was observed. In the MC4 receptor a similar biphasic pattern was observed, although the inhibitory component was more pronounced, because Zn(II) in concentrations from 1 to 10 μm inhibited NPD-α-MSH (α-MSH has a potency at 350 nm on the MC4 receptor in COS-7 cells, therefore, the more potent agonist NDP-α-MSH was used on the MC4 receptor)-induced cAMP production down to ∼35% (Fig.4 D). As in the MC1 receptor, at higher concentrations the inhibitory effect of the metal ion apparently disappeared, and from 10 to 100 μm Zn(II) the cAMP accumulation was increased to the level observed with NPD-α-MSH alone (Fig. 4 D). These experiments indicate that Zn(II) functions not only as a partial agonist on the MC1 and MC4 receptors but apparently also as a potentiator of the agonistic function of the peptide agonists, α-MSH and NDP-α-MSH. This was directly studied by performing dose-response experiments with α-MSH/NDP-α-MSH in the presence and absence of Zn(II). Addition of a constant concentration of Zn(II) (10−4m) shifted the dose-response curve for α-MSH and NDP-α-MSH to the left in the MC1 and the MC4 receptors, respectively, indicating that Zn(II) does act as an enhancer or potentiator of the peptide agonist (Fig.5). The enhancing effect of Zn(II) was most pronounced in the MC1 receptor, where the α-MSH potency (EC50 in respect of cAMP stimulation) without Zn(II) was 116 nm, and in the presence of zinc (10−4m) it was increased to 20 nm (Fig.5 A). Zn(II) at 10−4m gave ∼50% of the maximal α-MSH-induced stimulation; however, as shown in Fig. 4the combination of Zn(II) and α-MSH gave a supra-maximal, additive response, because the dose-response curve for α-MSH was basically shifted upward in the presence of Zn(II) (Fig. 5 A). A similar, but smaller, enhancing and additive effect of Zn(II) on the α-MSH stimulation of cAMP accumulation was observed in the MC4 receptor; however, instead of a 6-fold shift in potency only a 2-fold shift of the dose-response curve for α-MSH from 1.1 to 0.6 nm was observed (Fig. 5 B). Previously we have found that metal ions may bind to metal-ion sites in receptors in complex with certain small organic, hydrophobic metal-ion chelators (24Holst B. Elling C.E. Schwartz T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 263-270Google Scholar, 25Elling C.E. Thirstrup K. Holst B. Schwartz T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12322-12327Google Scholar). In the melanocortin receptors, Zn(II) in complex with 1,10-phenanthroline and with 2, 2′ bipyridine bound with affinities similar to that of the free metal ion,i.e. with K i values of 24 and 22 μm, respectively, at the MC1 receptor (Table I). However, in contrast to the free metal ion, the complex between the chelator and the metal ions inhibited the radioligand as efficiently as the peptide agonists did, i.e. down to the unspecific level (Fig. 2). Six 1,10-phenanthroline analogs and three 2,2′-bipyridine analogs were tested for their ability to bind to and activate both the MC1 and the MC4 receptors (Tables I and II). In general, the tested 1,10-phenanthroline analogs in complex with Zn(II) showed a 2- to 20-fold increase in affinity compared with the unmodified Zn(II)-1,10-phenanthroline. Only the compound 1f where the 1,10-phenanthroline was substituted with trichloromethyl groups in positions 2 and 9, i.e. in the position next to the metal ion chelating nitrogens, bound the MC1 receptor with approximately the same affinity as the Zn(II)-1,10-phenanthroline or free Zn(II). Similarly, most of the 2,2′-bipyridine analogs in complex with zinc had an increased affinity for the MC1 and MC4 receptor compared with Zn(II)-2,2′-bipyridine (Table I). Interestingly, the two melanocortin receptors had a very similar pharmacological profile for the metal ion-chelator complexes when tested in competition binding analysis. That is, the affinity of the different metal ion-chelator complexes to the MC1 and the MC4 receptors correlated closely, with an rvalue of 0.89 (p < 0.0001, Spearman test). This could indicate that the metal-ion site is conserved among the MC receptors.Table IIAgonist efficacy and potency for Zn(II) and Zn(II) chelator compounds in the MC1 and MC4 receptorsMC1 receptorMC4 receptorEfficacyEC50(n)EfficacyEC50(n)% of max Zn(II) ± SEMμm ± SEM% of max Zn(II) ± SEMμm ± SEMZn100 ± 2011 ± 4(7)100 ± 3013 ± 4(8)Zn[Phe]43 ± 1512 ± 3(3)NS(3)Zn[1a]aThe chelator compounds without zinc did not stimulate the receptor.NSbNS, no stimulation.(2)NS(2)Zn[1b]NS(2)NS(2)Zn[1c]167 ± 408.1 ± 1.5(4)NS(3)Zn[1d]60 ± 15(3)NS(2)Zn[1e]NS(3)NS(2)Zn[1f]NS(3)NS(2)Zn[Dip]30 ± 1082 ± 13(3)NS(2)Zn[2a]65 ± 12(3)NS(2)Zn[2b]78 ± 11(3)62 ± 152.7 ± 0.8(3)Zn[2c]87 ± 19(3)53 ± 12(3)Efficacy was determined as the cAMP response to 100 μm of the ligands expressed as percentage of maximum Zn(II)-induced stimulation.a The chelator compounds without zinc did not stimulate the receptor.b NS, no stimulation.

Zn(II)-1,10-phenanthroline and Zn(II)-2,2′-bipyridine as well as the analogs were tested for their ability to activate the receptors (TableII). In contrast to the findings in the competition binding experiments, the MC1 and MC4 receptors exhibited very different pharmacological profiles for the metal ion chelator compounds when tested in the functional assay. Thus, despite the fact that the metal ion-chelator complexes bound with very similar affinity in the two receptors, seven out of the eleven complexes acted as agonists on the MC1 receptor but only two on the MC4 receptor. Furthermore, the most efficacious complex on the MC1 had no effect on the MC4 receptor. The molecular structure of the chelators was important for the degree of activation they induced on the MC1 receptor. Zn(II)-1,10-phenanthroline and Zn(II)-2,2′-dipyridine had a lower efficacy than the free zinc ion (Fig. 6 A and Table II). However, when these simple chelators were chemically modified, higher efficacies could be obtained. One of the compounds, 1c (Zn-(5-chloro-1,10-phenanthroline), was not only 2-fold more potent than the free metal ion but also had a higher efficacy reaching 167% of the maximally Zn(II)-induced cAMP production (Fig. 6 A).

https://openalex.org/W2025183773,"Fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs) form native intracellular complexes with the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) scaffold protein islet-brain 2 (IB2) in adult brain. FHF binding to IB2 facilitates recruitment of the MAPK p38δ (SAPK4), while failing to stimulate binding of JNK, the preferred kinase of the related scaffold IB1 (JIP-1). We now report further biochemical evidence supporting FHFs as regulators of IB2 scaffold activity. Mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3) and IB2 synergistically activate p38δ but not the MAPKs JNK-1 and p38α. Binding of p38δ to IB2 is mediated by the carboxyl-terminal half of the scaffold (IB2Δ1–436). FHF2 also binds weakly to IB2Δ1–436 and can thereby increase p38δ interaction with IB2Δ1–436. FHF-induced recruitment of p38δ to IB2 is accompanied by increased levels of activated p38δ, and synergistic activation of p38δ by MLK3 and IB2 is further enhanced by FHF2. Consistent with a role for FHFs as signaling molecules, FHF2 isolated from rat brain is serine/threonine-phosphorylated, and FHF can serve as a substrate for p38δ in vitro. These results support the existence of a signaling module in which IB2 scaffolds a MLK3/MKK/p38δ kinase cascade. FHFs aid in recruitment of p38 to IB2 and may serve as kinase substrates.

Cellular responses to extracellular signals include activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAPKK, MAPK kinase; MAPKKK, MAPKK kinase; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; MLK, mixed lineage kinase; JIP, JNK-interacting protein; IB1 and IB2, islet brain-1 and -2, respectively; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; FHF, FGF homologous factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin pathways that coordinate proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and survival. In mammalian cells, the three known branches of MAPKs are extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), c-Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNKs), and p38 MAPKs, the latter two referred to collectively as stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs), since they mediate responses both to environmental stresses and to proinflammatory cytokines (1Tibbles L.A. Woodgett J.R. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1230-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Activated SAPKs phosphorylate a wide variety of proteins, including transcription factors and cytoskeletal proteins (reviewed in Refs. 2Davis R.J.

Sci. 2000; 25: 257-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). MAPKs are typically activated through three-tiered kinase cascades; MAPK kinase kinases (MAPKKKs) activate MAPK kinases (MAPKKs), which in turn activate MAPKs (4Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar, 5Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar). Several different MAPKKKs can activate SAPKs, including TAK1, ASK1, and members of the family of mixed lineage kinases (MLKs). A set of MAPKKs mediates activation of SAPKs, with MKK4 and MKK7 generally activating JNKs and MKK3 and MKK6 generally activating p38s. JNKs are regulators of cell proliferation and apoptosis during development and in response to environmental stress (2Davis R.J.

Among the four p38 proteins, p38α and p38β play roles in cytokine- and stress-induced actin cytoskeletal reorganization (7Huot J. Houle F. Rousseau S. Deschesnes R.G. Shah G.M. Landry J. J.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 257-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Although no specific biological function has been uncovered for p38δ (also known as SAPK4) (10Goedert M. Cuenda A. Craxton M. Jakes R. Cohen P.

In vitro kinase assays have revealed a partially overlapping but distinct substrate specificity for p38δ, including the ability to phosphorylate certain microtubule-associated proteins (13Parker C.G.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4360-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In addition, some studies suggest that p38δ may be activated by a broader spectrum of MAPKKs, including MKK4 and MKK7 (16Hu M.C. Wang Y.P. Mikhail A. Qiu W.R. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7095-7102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Scaffold proteins contribute to signaling efficiency and/or specificity of MAP kinase signaling by sequestering MAPK and upstream activating kinases (17Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). JNK-interacting protein (JIP)-1, also known as islet brain-1 (IB1), is a vertebrate scaffold protein that regulates JNK activity. IB1 was discovered as a JNK-binding protein that also binds MAPKKKs of the MLK family and the MAPKK MKK7 (18Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 696Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 19Bonny C. Nicod P. Waeber G. J. Biol.

Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). IB1 facilitates JNK activation when overexpressed by transfection together with IB1-interacting upstream kinases (20Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J.

Forced overexpression of IB1 or its JNK-binding domain inhibits JNK signaling in many types of cells (18Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 696Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 19Bonny C. Nicod P. Waeber G. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 16466-16472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Endogenous IB1 appears to serve as both a positive and negative regulator of JNK activity. JNK activation in mechanically stressed urothelium is negatively regulated by IB1, as demonstrated by gain- and loss-of-function experiments (23Tawadros T. Formenton A. Dudler J. Thompson N. Nicod P. Leisinger H.J. Waeber G. Haefliger J.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 385-393PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, analysis of IB1-deficient mice showed IB1 to be required for JNK activation in hippocampal neurons following exposure to excitotoxins or to anoxic stress (20Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). IB2 and its highly similar alternative splice isoform, JIP-2 (Fig.1 A), were discovered through their homology with IB1. IB2 and IB1 share considerable amino acid sequence homology in an N-terminal region encompassing the JNK-binding domain in IB1 and in the C-terminal half including, but not limited to, the Src homology 3 and phosphotyrosine-binding domains (see Fig.1 A). IB2 and JIP-2 interact with MLKs and MKK7, and initial studies had identified IB2 and JIP-2 as additional putative scaffolds regulating the JNK pathway (24Yasuda J. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7245-7254Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 25Negri S. Oberson A. Steinmann M. Sauser C. Nicod P. Waeber G. Schorderet D.F. Bonny C. Genomics. 2000; 64: 324-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In contrast to IB1, however, IB2 interacts in vivo with fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs) (26Schoorlemmer J. Goldfarb M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 793-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). FHFs were initially identified by virtue of their sequence homology to fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) (27Smallwood P.M. Munoz-Sanjuan I. Tong P. Macke J.P. Hendry S.H. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9850-9857Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 28Hartung H. Feldman B. Lovec H. Coulier F. Birnbaum D. Goldfarb M.

Evol. 1997; 44: 43-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, FHFs are different from FGFs in several ways. FHF proteins are synthesized and localized within native or transfected expressing cells (26Schoorlemmer J. Goldfarb M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 793-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 27Smallwood P.M. Munoz-Sanjuan I. Tong P. Macke J.P. Hendry S.H. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9850-9857Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), as opposed to the function of FGFs as secreted growth factors acting on extracellular receptors (30Ornitz D.M. Xu J. Colvin J.S. McEwen D.G. MacArthur C.A. Coulier F. Gao G. Goldfarb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15292-15297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). Consistent with FHF intracellular localization, we have shown that FHFs facilitate recruitment of a specific SAPK, p38δ, to IB2 in transfected 293T cells (26Schoorlemmer J. Goldfarb M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 793-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These findings have revealed fundamental differences in the signaling complexes assembled by IB2 versus IB1. Here, taking advantage of the identification of p38δ as a potential IB2-regulated kinase, we investigated the role of FHFs in recruitment of p38δ to IB2 and subsequent activation of p38δ in a tissue culture overexpression system. We show that FHF interaction with IB2 facilitates the association and subsequent activation of p38δ. We also show that p38δ interacts with the C-terminal half of IB2, which stands in contrast to JNK interaction with the amino-terminal region of IB1 (JIP-1b). Last, we show that FHF2 is serine/threonine-phosphorylated in adult rat brain, consistent with an intracellular function for this IB2-interacting protein. Four murine and corresponding human FHF genes were described by Jeremy Nathans and co-workers (27Smallwood P.M. Munoz-Sanjuan I. Tong P. Macke J.P. Hendry S.H. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9850-9857Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Our data base searches identified three of these four FHF genes, which we had originally referred to as FGFs (FGF-11 = FHF3, FGF-12 = FHF1, FGF-13 = FHF2) (28Hartung H. Feldman B. Lovec H. Coulier F. Birnbaum D. Goldfarb M. Mech Dev. 1997; 64: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 29Coulier F. Pontarotti P. Roubin R. Hartung H. Goldfarb M. Birnbaum D. J. Mol.

Genomics. 1997; 40: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and FHF4 was given the alternative name FGF-14 (32Wang Q. McEwen D.G. Ornitz D.M. Mech. Dev. 2000; 90: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Since FHFs so far lack demonstrable FGF-like activity and since we have characterized an intracellular function for these factors, we now refer to these factors solely by the acronym FHF, in order to distinguish them from FGFs. Our previously described FGF-12A is now referred to as FHF1, whereas the alternatively spliced FGF-12B is herein referred to as FHF1B (28Hartung H. Feldman B. Lovec H. Coulier F. Birnbaum D. Goldfarb M. Mech Dev. 1997; 64: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Alluding to its most prominent sites of expression, we (26Schoorlemmer J. Goldfarb M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 793-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and others (25Negri S. Oberson A. Steinmann M. Sauser C. Nicod P. Waeber G. Schorderet D.F. Bonny C. Genomics. 2000; 64: 324-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) have described islet brain-2 (IB2), whereas an alternative splice form of this gene has been described as JIP-2 (24Yasuda J. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7245-7254Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). In the absence ofin vivo data implicating IB2 or JIP-2 in regulation of JNK, we have adopted the functionally neutral islet brain nomenclature. Vectors to express wild type and mutant derivatives of human IB2, murine IB1(JIP-1B) (20Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), and human SHP-2 (33Lechleider R.J. Freeman R.M.J. Neel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13434-13438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as N-terminal FLAG-tagged proteins have been described as well as vectors to express N-terminal 5× Myc-tagged versions of human FGF1 (GenBankTM accession number E04557) and the long isoform of FHF2 (34Schoorlemmer J. Goldfarb M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 793-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). pCDNA-T7-MLK3 was constructed by PCR modification of a human MLK3 cDNA template to add the N-terminal T7 tag (MASMTGGQQMG) prior to cloning into pCDNA3 (Invitrogen). The β1 isoform of human MKK7 (35Tournier C. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1569-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was reverse transcriptase-PCR-amplified from human brain cDNA and cloned into pEBG (36Sanchez M.P. Tapley P. Saini S.S. He B. Pulido D. Barbacid M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1819-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) to attach an N-terminal GST tag. All other kinase expression vectors, including pCDNA- HA-JNK1α1, pCEV29-HA-p38α, pCEFL-HA-p38δ, and pCEFL-HA-MLK3, were gifts from R. Silvio Gutkind. Antibodies to epitope tags were as follows: HA tag, mouse monoclonal 12CA5, IgG2b, and Myc tag, mouse monoclonal 9E10, IgG1 (Mt. Sinai School of Medicine Monoclonal Antibody Facility); FLAG tag, mouse monoclonal M2, IgG1 (Sigma); FLAG tag, rabbit polyclonal (Zymed Laboratories Inc.); T7 tag, mouse monoclonal, IgG2b (Novagen); GST tag, mouse monoclonal, IgG1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbits were immunized against peptides corresponding to mouse FHF2 residues 234–244 (GGKSMSHNEST) synthesized with added N-terminal cysteine for sulfhydryl-mediated directional coupling to carrier protein (Research Genetics). Antibodies were affinity-purified with corresponding peptides immobilized on activated agarose (Pierce). FHF2 antibodies recognized FHF2, but not FHF-1, in lysates from expression vector-transfected 293T cells. FHF2 antibodies were biotinylated using N-sulfo-biotin reagent (Pierce). Western blotting employed horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies specific for mIgG1, mIgG2b, rabbit IgG (CALTAG), or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (CALTAG) to detect biotinylated FHF2 antibodies. 293T cells seeded onto gelatinized or Primaria-coated six-well cluster dishes (Falcon) were transiently transfected and subsequently harvested as described (34Schoorlemmer J. Goldfarb M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 793-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). From experiment to experiment, small differences in cell density, growth rate, and response to transfection conditions substantially influenced the magnitude of responses reported. Therefore, each figure panel presents comparisons made among samples derived from the same transfection. Immunoprecipitation assays from transiently transfected 293T cell extracts as well as subsequent analysis by SDS-PAGE and standard Western blot analysis have been described (34Schoorlemmer J. Goldfarb M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 793-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated before lysis with 0.5 mm H2O2 for 30 min or with 50 ng/ml anisomycin for 20 min. MAPK activities in transfected cells were detected by immune complex kinase assays performed as previously described (37Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar). Cell extracts containing HA-tagged kinases were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 2 μg of 12CA5 anti-HA in lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated using GammaBindG-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in PBS, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate; once with 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m LiCl; and once with kinase buffer (12.5 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 12.5 mmβ−glycerophosphate, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mm NaF, 0.5 mm EGTA). Pellets were incubated in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 1 μg of substrate, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 3.3 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 μm ATP for 30 min at 30 °C on a shaking platform. Bacterially expressed GST-ATF-2 or GST-c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used as substrate for p38s and JNK, respectively. Recombinant human FHF1B used as a substrate was purified from induced BL21(DE3)pLysS harboring pET-FHF1B vector. Assays were terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The incorporation of 32P in substrate was visualized by autoradiography, and quantitated after PhosphorImager exposure using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Only extracts with comparable levels of exogenous HA-tagged kinases were compared, as determined by Western blotting of extracts and immunoprecipitated kinases. Activity of HA-tagged p38δ or HA-tagged JNK1 was also assayed by electrophoresis, blotting, and probing with antibodies specific for threonine/tyrosine dually phosphorylated p38 and JNK proteins, respectively (New England Biolabs). Protein extracts from 7-day-old rat pup cerebella were prepared as described (34Schoorlemmer J. Goldfarb M. Curr.

Cerebellar extracts (1 mg of protein) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 2 μg of antibody in lysis buffer. Immune complexes were recovered the following day using Protein G-Sepharose. Pellets were washed two times in lysis buffer, once in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin and once in 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.5 mmMnCl2, 30 μm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm benzamidine, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (PP buffer). Pellets were incubated in 50 μl of PP buffer in the presence of PP2a (a generous gift from David Li) with or without 50 nm okadaic acid for 20 min at 30 °C on a shaking platform. Assays were terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (12% gels) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Protein species in immunoprecipitates or total lysates were identified by standard Western blot analysis, using primary biotinylated antibody, streptavidin-conjugated secondary antibodies (CALTAG), and chemiluminescence detection with ECL reagent (AmershamBiosciences). IB2 can complex with p38δ but not other MAPKs, including JNK1, in transfected 293T cells (26Schoorlemmer J. Goldfarb M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 793-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that IB2 may regulate p38δ kinase activity. As a means to survey the putative involvement of IB2 in regulation of p38δ, we tested whether IB2 was capable of stimulating or inhibiting activation of p38δ in 293T cells. Basal activity of p38δ, detected by the presence of phospho-p38δ, was found to be weakly activated in some experiments by coexpression of IB2 (Fig.2 A). Additionally, IB2 increased activation of p38δ induced by peroxide stress (Fig.2 A). By contrast, activation of p38δ by anisomycin stress was inhibited by IB2 expression (Fig. 2 B), similar to findings reported for effects of IB1 (JIP-1) on JNK activation (20Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). These findings demonstrate that IB2 can positively or negatively modulate signaling pathways leading to p38δ activation. IB2 binds to the MAPKKK MLK3 and related members of the family of mixed lineage kinases but not to several other MAPKKKs (24Yasuda J. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7245-7254Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) and binds to the MAPKK MKK7 but not to other MKKs (24Yasuda J. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7245-7254Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar,25Negri S. Oberson A. Steinmann M. Sauser C. Nicod P. Waeber G. Schorderet D.F. Bonny C. Genomics. 2000; 64: 324-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). 2J. Schoorlemmer and M. Goldfarb, unpublished data. Hence, IB2 is envisaged to scaffold a MAPK pathway, enlisting MLKs and MKK7 as upstream kinases of p38δ. However, the published data regarding the ability of MKK7 to activate p38δ is conflicting (10Goedert M. Cuenda A. Craxton M. Jakes R. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 16Hu M.C. Wang Y.P. Mikhail A. Qiu W.R. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7095-7102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To address this issue, we tested directly the ability of MKK7 to activate p38δ. Upon coexpression of both kinases in 293T cells, protein kinase activity of p38δ (measured on immunoprecipitates using ATF-2 as in vitro substrate) was easily demonstrated (Fig. 2 C). In order to test the potential of IB2 to facilitate activation of p38δ by upstream kinases, we coexpressed IB2 and p38δ proteins in 293T cells together with increasing amounts of an upstream activator kinase, MLK3. Parallel transfections were performed using JNK1 in place of p38δ as a negative control. MAPK activities were measured with antibodies specific for either phospho-p38 or phospho-JNK. In the absence of IB2, MLK3 activated JNK-1 or p38δ in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.3, A and B). Activation of JNK by increasing amounts of MLK3 was not enhanced by the inclusion of IB2 (Fig. 3 B), consistent with the absence of detectable IB2/JNK binding in 293T cells (26Schoorlemmer J. Goldfarb M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 793-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). By contrast, IB2 significantly enhanced the weak activation of p38δ by MLK3 (Fig.3 A). Together, these findings provide evidence that IB2 assembles a signaling cascade in which MLK3 activates p38δ, presumably through the MAPKK MKK7. We have previously shown that FHFs promote IB2/p38δ interaction, identifying FHFs as cofactors in the recruitment of p38δ into a heterotrimeric IB2·FHF·p38δ complex (26Schoorlemmer J. Goldfarb M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 793-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The FHF-independent activation of p38δ by MLK3 and IB2 seen above (Fig. 3 A) might have been the consequence of high IB2 expression in these experiments together with inherently weak IB2 affinity for p38δ. We tested this possibility by analyzing IB2·p38δ complex formation in transfected 293T cells, varying the amounts of IB2 and FHF2 proteins. At lower IB2 protein levels, weak p38δ interaction was potentiated by FHF2 (Fig.4 A, lanes 1 and 3), as reported previously (26Schoorlemmer J. Goldfarb M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 793-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). By contrast, IB2/p38δ interaction could be rendered FHF-independent when IB2 expression levels were increased (Fig. 4 A). At high scaffold concentration, IB2 still could not complex significantly with other p38s or with JNK1, ERK2, or ERKS/big MAPK (data not shown). In order to map the region of IB2 required for p38δ interaction, we employed several terminal and internal deletion derivatives of human IB2 (Fig. 1 B) in cotransfection with p38δ. The analysis was guided by the presence of a major FHF-binding domain within the region spanning IB2 residues 212–471 (26Schoorlemmer J. Goldfarb M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 793-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and three regions of IB2/IB1 homology (see Fig. 1 A). Region I spans IB2 residues 55–141 and includes residues homologous to the JNK-binding domain on IB1 (18Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 696Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), region II spans IB2 residues 477–504, and region III spans the C-terminal 263 residues of IB2 (including both an Src homology 3 domain and a phosphotyrosine-binding domain). IB2/p38δ interactions were assayed after cotransfection of FLAG-tagged IB2 mutants, HA-tagged p38δ, and in some cases Myc-tagged FHF2. We manipulated IB2 expression to higher or lower levels, which allowed comparison of FHF-independent (Fig. 4 B) with FHF-induced (Fig. 4, C and D) interaction with p38δ. IB2·p38δ complexes were assayed by anti-HA Western blot after anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4, B andD), whereas heterotrimeric FHF·IB2·p38δ complexes were assayed by anti-HA Western blot after anti-Myc (FHF) immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4 C). These data are also summarized in Fig. 1 B. An IB2 mutant (IB2Δ90–174) harboring a deletion in region I was as efficient as wild-type IB2 for p38δ binding (Fig.4 B). This mutant also effectively mediated formation of a FHF2·IB2Δ90–174·p38δ heterotrimeric complex (Fig.4 C). Hence, despite sequence homology between IB1 and IB2 in the region encompassing the JNK-binding domain of IB1, the corresponding domain of IB2 is dispensable for binding of p38δ. Further mutational analysis demonstrated that p38δ binding requires more C-terminal IB2 sequence elements. IB2Δ212–471 complexed with p38δ as efficiently as did full-length IB2 (Fig. 4 B). However, IB2Δ459–529 and IB2Δ514–797, bearing deletions spanning region II or III, respectively, displayed reduced abilities to bind p38δ, whereas IB2Δ459–797 could not interact with p38δ at all (Fi"

The malaria genome project has revealed that SERA is a member of the SERA multigene family consisting of eight SERA homologues clustered on chromosome 2 and one SERA homologue on chromosome 9. Northern blotting and real time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR with five independent parasite strains, including three allelic representative forms of the SERA gene, have shown that all of the SERA homologues are transcribed most actively at trophozoite and schizont stages and that SERA5 (SERA/SERP) is transcribed predominantly among the family. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against recombinant proteins representing the N-terminal portions of four significantly transcribed SERA homologues (SERA3 to -6) in the center of the cluster on chromosome 2. Using these antibodies, indirect immunofluorescence microscopy detected the expression of SERA3 to -6, with similar localization, in all trophozoite- and schizont-infected erythrocytes. We have examined 40 sera from Ugandan adults for their antibody reactivity and found that enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titer against SERA5 N-terminal domain, but not against other SERA proteins, is positively correlated with the inhibition of in vitro parasite growth by individual sera.

Among four species of human malaria parasites,Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for more than a million deaths annually. The appearance of drug-resistant parasites and insecticide-refractory mosquito vectors has made its control more difficult. It is therefore of increasing importance to develop effective malaria vaccines. P. falciparum serine repeat antigen (SERA) 1The abbreviations used are: SERA, serine repeat antigen; gDNA, genomic DNA; RT, reverse transcription; MSP-1, merozoite surface protein-1; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline (1Bzik D.J. Li W.B. Horii T. Inselburg J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 30: 279-288Google Scholar) is an asexual blood stage antigen produced in large amounts, specifically during late trophozoite and schizont stages (2Delplace P. Fortier B. Tronchin G. Dubremetz J.F. Vernes A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 23: 193-203Google Scholar, 3Fox B.A. Bzik D.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 68: 133-144Google Scholar). SERA protein (also called SERP (4Knapp B. Hundt E. Nau U. Kupper H.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 32: 73-83Google Scholar) or p126 (5Delplace P. Dubremetz J.F. Fortier B. Vernes A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 17: 239-251Google Scholar)) is secreted into the lumen of the parasitophorous vacuole after removal of the signal peptide (6Debrabant A. Maes P. Delplace P. Dubremetz J.F. Tartar A. Camus D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 53: 89-95Google Scholar). Upon schizont rupture, SERA is processed into a 47-kDa N-terminal, a 50-kDa central, an 18-kDa C-terminal, and a 6-kDa domain (6Debrabant A. Maes P. Delplace P. Dubremetz J.F. Tartar A. Camus D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 53: 89-95Google Scholar). The complex of 47- and 18-kDa peptides is associated with merozoite, and the 50-kDa fragment is shed into the culture medium (7Pang X.L. Mitamura T. Horii T. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1821-1827Google Scholar, 8Li J. Mitamura T. Fox B.A. Bzik D.J. Horii T. Parasitol Int. 2002; 53: 89-95Google Scholar). The activity responsible for the primary processing step of SERA to P47 and P73 is sensitive to the serine protease inhibitor diisopropyl fluorophosphate, whereas the activity for the conversion of P56 into P50 is sensitive to cysteine protease inhibitors E-64, leupeptin, and iodoacetoamide (9Li J. Matsuoka H. Mitamura T. Horii T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 120: 177-186Google Scholar). Mouse and rat antibodies against the N-terminal 47-kDa domain have been shown to inhibit the intraerythrocytic proliferation of parasitesin vitro (7Pang X.L. Mitamura T. Horii T. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1821-1827Google Scholar, 10Sugiyama T. Suzue K. Okamoto M. Inselburg J. Tai K. Horii T. Vaccine. 1996; 14: 1069-1076Google Scholar, 11Fox B.A. Xing-Li P. Suzue K. Horii T. Bzik D.J.

Vaccine. 1998; 16: 1299-1305Google Scholar), but rat antibodies against the central 50-kDa domain have little effect (10Sugiyama T. Suzue K. Okamoto M. Inselburg J. Tai K. Horii T. Vaccine. 1996; 14: 1069-1076Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins corresponding to the 47-kDa domain of SERA conferred protective immunity in Aotus and squirrel monkeys against the parasite challenges (13Inselburg J. Bzik D.J. Li W.B.

Tanioka Y. Horii T. Parasitol. Int. 1997; 46: 17-25Google Scholar). The epidemiological study in a holoendemic area of Uganda has revealed that increased level of IgG against 47-kDa peptide correlates with lower parasitemias in the peripheral blood and absence of fever in a group of children, but IgG level against 50-kDa peptide does not (17Okech B.A. Nalunkuma A. Okello D. Pang X.L. Suzue K. Li J. Horii T. Egwang T.G. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2001; 65: 912-917Google Scholar). Thus, the N-terminal domain of SERA is a promising candidate for a malaria vaccine. It was previously reported that the N-terminal domain of SERA is polymorphic, and according to the amino acid sequences, all of the examined alleles can be grouped into three major allelic families, namely FCR3 type, K1 type, and Honduras-1 type in laboratory strains and field isolates (18Morimatsu K. Morikawa T. Tanabe K. Bzik D.J. Horii T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 86: 249-254Google Scholar, 19Liu Q. Ferreira M.U. Ndawi B.T. Ohmae H. Adagu I.S. Morikawa T. Horii T. Isomura S. Kawamoto F. Southeast Asian J. Trop. Med. Public Health. 2000; 31: 808-817Google Scholar). Knapp et al. (20Knapp B. Nau U. Hundt E. Kupper H.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 44: 1-13Google Scholar) have reported that a SERA homologue gene (SERP-H) is located adjacent to the SERA gene, although it does not contain a serine stretch, and that a 130-kDa polypeptide is expressed from the SERP-H gene during schizont stage and localizes in the parasitophorous vacuole. Fox and Bzik (3Fox B.A. Bzik D.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 68: 133-144Google Scholar) have shown that another SERA homologue (designated as SERA3 in the original paper) is located 1.8 kb upstream of the SERA gene and is transcribed at the trophozoite and schizont stages. Recently, the malaria genome project has revealed that these genes belong to the SERA multigene family, consisting of eight open reading frames clustered in tandem on chromosome 2 (21Gardner M.J. Tettelin H. Carucci D.J. Cummings L.M. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Shallom S. Mason T. Yu K. Fujii C. Pederson J. Shen K. Jing J. Aston C. Lai Z. Schwartz D.C. Pertea M. Salzberg S. Zhou L. Sutton G.G. Clayton R. White O. Smith H.O. Fraser C.M. Hoffman S.L. et al.Science. 1998; 282: 1126-1132Google Scholar). The eight open reading frames on chromosome 2 are designated as SERA1 to SERA8 in the direction from centromere to telomere. Previously described SERA (SERP or p126), SERP-H and SERA3, correspond to SERA5 (PFB0340c), SERA6 (PFB0335c), and SERA4 (PFB0345c), respectively. A serine repeat is found only at the N-terminal region of SERA5. All members in the SERA multigene family contain a papain protease-like motif, and SERA1 to -5 contain a serine residue instead of a cysteine residue at the putative active nucleophile position, suggesting that they are serine proteases with a typical structure of cysteine protease (3Fox B.A. Bzik D.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 68: 133-144Google Scholar, 22Higgins D.G. McConnell D.J. Sharp P.M. Nature. 1989; 340: 604Google Scholar, 23Eakin A.E. Higaki J.N. Mckerrow J.H. Craik C.S. Nature. 1989; 342: 132Google Scholar, 24Mottram D.G. Coombs G.H. North M.J. Nature. 1989; 342: 132Google Scholar). The evasion and/or prevention of the protective host immune responses are critical for the successful survival of Plasmodiumparasites. Genetic polymorphism in a single locus gene or multigene family, frequently found in malaria vaccine candidate genes, may represent genetic backgrounds that function for parasite immune evasion mechanism. To see whether the SERA multigene family, as a vaccine candidate antigen, exhibits antigenic variation, we characterized the expression profile of each member in this family. The data obtained demonstrate that the SERA5 gene is predominantly expressed and co-expressed with adjacent SERA homologue genes (SERA3, -4, and -6) in every single parasite cell with similar localization in trophozoites and schizonts. Moreover, antibody level in an individual human serum against SERA5 N-terminal domain, but not those for other homologues, is correlated with in vitro parasite growth inhibition. FCR3 (25Kubata V.K.

Cultures were maintained in 5% O2 and 5% CO2 atmosphere with 3% type O erythrocyte (v/v) in the culture medium containing 10% heat-inactivated human serum. For large scale culture and growth inhibition assay with human serum, 5 mg/ml AlbuMax (Invitrogen) was used in place of 10% human serum. For synchronization, schizont-rich parasites were purified by 63% (v/v) Percoll (Amersham Biosciences) density centrifugation (32Tosta C.E. Sedegah M. Henderson D.C. Wedderburn N. Exp. Parasitol. 1980; 50: 7-15Google Scholar) and incubated within 4 h in fresh medium with 3% erythrocyte prior to 5% sorbitol treatment. Total RNA was isolated from 0.075% saponin-treated (Sigma) synchronized parasite cells of Honduras-1, FCR3, K1, Dd2, and 3D7 with TRIZOLTMreagent (Invitrogen). First strand cDNA was synthesized with the SuperscriptTM First-strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) using 20 ng of each total RNA. Target cDNAs were amplified by the following primer sets: SERA1/for (5′-AAATTCAGCAATTTGTATGAAATATCC-3′) and SERA1/rev (5′-AGAAATAGCATGTGGTTCATAACCTT-3′), SERA2/for (5′-GAAAAACCTGACACCACTACTAGGAT-3′) and SERA2/rev (5′-GCAGGTGCTATAAAATCATATTCATC-3′), SERA3/for (5′-GATATGTTTAAAGCAAATGAACATGG-3′) and SERA3/rev (5′-AAACTTTTAATGGGTTTGAACCTTCT-3′), SERA4/for (5′-AACTTAAAGCAACCAATAACATCCAT-3′) and SERA4/rev (5′-AAATGATATTCGCTAGATTCCTCATC-3′), SERA5/for (5′-CTTAGATAATTATGGGATGGGAAATG-3′) and SERA5/rev (5′-GTTGTATCAACATGTACGACACCTTT-3′), SERA6/for (5′-TTGTTAAAATCTCATTCTGACGAAAA-3′) and SERA6/rev (5′-CATCAGAATTTTCTTTGTCATCATTT3′), SERA7/for (5′-TAATTGTTCGGATAGAGATTCTGATG-3′) and SERA7/rev (5′-TTTTGTAGTCATACGTTGTCTTGGAC-3′), SERA8/for (5′-TACCTGAGAGGAAAATATTCAAACCT-3′) and SERA8/rev (5′-GTAAGCTGCTATAACAACACTCGAAG-3′). As an internal control, a primer set (MSP1/for (5′-TTCGTGCAAATGAATTAGACGTAC-3′) and MSP1/rev (5′-GGATCAGTAAATAAACTATCAATGT-3′)) that annealed to the conserved blocks 3 and 5 of the merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1) gene (33Tanabe K.

All RNA preparations gave no PCR product when reverse transcriptase was omitted from the RT-PCR. The efficacies of PCR primers were confirmed by using genomic DNA (gDNA) as a template. gDNAs were isolated from saponin-treated parasite cells of Honduras-1, FCR3, and K1 with DNAZOLTMreagent (Invitrogen). The PCR cycle used was as follows: 91 °C (1 min 30 s) followed by appropriate cycles of 91 °C (30 s), 50 °C (30 s), and 58 °C (3 min). Total RNA from Honduras-1, FCR3, and K1 strains were fractionated on a 1.2% agarose/formaldehyde gel (1 μg/lane) and transferred onto Nytran membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was probed with PCR products, which had been amplified by the same set of primers for RT-PCR and labeled with deoxycytidine 5′-triphosphate α-32P (250 μCi/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), exposed to a Fuji Film BAS imaging plate, and analyzed with MacBAS 1500 (Fuji Film Co.).

Primers and probe sets were as follows: SERA1/for (5′-AGTTGATATGTATGGACCATCAACA-3′), SERA1/rev (5′-ATGGTTTACCTTATCTTCTTGGGA-3′), and SERA1/probe (5′-TGTTCATCAGACGCATTAACCAATTTCA-3′); SERA2/for (5′-CCGCATCTGAGGCAGGA-3′), SERA2/rev (5′-ATCGGTTGATACAGGTAATGCTACA-3′), and SERA2/probe (5′-TCCTTGTTTCGTAATTTTTCCACCCGT-3′); SERA3/for (5′-TCTTACCAACAGAAGGAGATTATTCA-3′), SERA3/rev (5′-ATTTTGTTCTAATAATTTTGCATTTGC-3′), and SERA3/probe (5′-CTGGGCATGTTTCACCAACTTTACTTTG-3′); SERA4/for (5′-CCTCATCAAGCGGACAACAA-3′), SERA4/rev (5′-CTTCTGCCGGTGATGCTTCT-3′), and SERA4/probe (5′-CAACACAAGGACTATCACCAGCAACTGGAG-3′); SERA5/for (5′-TATTCTCTGAAAAGGAAGATAATGAAAACA-3′), SERA5/rev (5′-TGAAGTTCCTGCAGATTCTAATGC-3′), and SERA5/probe (5′-CCTGATCCTGCCGTATCTTGACCGAAT-3′); SERA6/for (5′-TGTAGCTAATTGTTCTAAGAGAAAACCTAT-3′), SERA6/rev (5′-AGGACAAGAATTACCTGCACTTGTA-3′), and SERA6/probe (5′-AAATTCTAATGGATTCGATCCTTCTTCACA-3′); SERA7/probe (5′-TCGTCGGATCGAATCCAGTTGAATTTCTAG-3′); SERA8/for (5′-TCTGTATTTGTTTCTATGGAAGTAACAGA-3′), SERA8/rev (5′-AATACTAAGGCATGATCCGGACTAT-3′), and SERA8/probe (5′-TCACAACTCATCATAACTTTTGTCCCATCA-3′); SERA9/for (5′-ACTGTTCATGGACAAAGTGGAGAA-3′), SERA9/rev (5′-ACAGCTCCTCTGTTCGAATCTTG-3′), and SERA9/probe (5′-TTCAACCTTCACAACTTCGATCTACCGCT-3′); MSP-1/for (5′-ATCCAAATCCTACTTGTAACGAAAATA-3′), MSP-1/rev (5′-TTCTTTCTGCTGCTACCTGAATC-3′), and MSP-1/probe (5′-TGGCATCTGCATCACATCCACC-3′). The first strand cDNA was added to the reaction mixture just prior to thermal cycling. The PCR cycle used was as follows: 50 °C (2 min) and 95 °C (10 min), followed by 60 cycles of 95 ° (15 s) and 60 °C (1 min). RT-PCR was used to prepare cDNA encoding a part of the N-terminal region of SERA3,SERA4, and SERA6 as described in the legend to Fig. 1. NdeI site and BamHI sites were introduced at the end of forward and reverse primers, respectively (restriction enzyme sites are underlined): SERA3/for (5′-GGAATTCCATATGACAACAGTGGACGAGAGTACC-3′ and SERA3/rev (5′-CGGGATCCAAATTTAAATGTTTGGTTTTTTCCAG-3′; SERA4/for (5′-GGAATTCCATATGACAACCGCCAGTACTACTCA-3′) and SERA4/rev (5′-CGGGATCCGAAATCAAATTTTTTTGTGTCATC-3′); SERA6/for (5′-GGAATTCCATATGGAAGGAAATAAAGTGACTGTGA-3′) and SERA6/rev (5′-CGGGATCCTAGTTTAAAATGATATCCTTCAGA-3′). The amplified fragment was digested with BamHI andNdeI and ligated to a BamHI- andNdeI-digested pET15b plasmid vector (Novagen). The resultant plasmid, pET-SE3N, pET-SE4N, or pET-SE6N, encodes the His tag (6 histidine residues) fused to its N-terminal domain of SERA3 (Thr67–Phe570), SERA4 (Thr67–Phe552), or SERA6 (Glu97–Leu765), respectively. The encoded fusion proteins were designated as His-SE3N, His-SE4N, and His-SE6N. The freshly transformed Escherichia coliBL21(DE3) cells with RIG plasmid (36Baca A.M. Hol W.G.J. Int. J. Parasitol. 2000; 30: 113-118Google Scholar) and either pET-SE3N, pET-SE4N, or pET-SE6N were grown in LB to a cell density of 1.0 × 108 cells/ml at 37 °C, and then isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. After incubation for an additional 3 h, cells were harvested and stored at −80° until use. Subsequent operations were carried out at 4 °C or on ice. The frozen cells expressing His-SE3N, His-SE4N, or His-SE6N protein were thawed and suspended in 5 cell paste volumes of buffer A (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole). The cells were disrupted by freezing and thawing, followed by repeated treatments with an ultrasonic disrupter (Tomy Seiko model UR-200P). The sonicated mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and guanidine HCl powder was directly dissolved into the supernatant at a final concentration of 6 m. Purifications of all three His-tagged fusion proteins (His-SE3N, His-SE4N, and His-SE6N) were performed with the same procedure provided from the Hi-Trap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences). The column (1-ml bed volume) was preloaded with 0.5 ml of 0.1 mNiSO4 to bind nickel ion and then equilibrated with 5 ml of buffer B (6 m guanidine HCl in buffer A). The 5–15 ml of cell lysate prepared above was applied onto the column. The proteins bound to the resin were further washed with 5 ml of buffer C (6m urea in buffer A) and then refolded with 10 ml of buffer A. Bound proteins were eluted with buffer D (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 500 mmimidazole). The eluted sample was applied again onto the column, and the whole purification procedure described above was repeated. The eluted fractions from second column chromatography were dialyzed against PBS, prior to thrombin protease treatment (10 units/1 mg of protein). The treated sample was loaded onto the equilibrated Hi-Trap chelating column bound with nickel ion, and flow-through fractions were collected. After removal of the His tag, each recombinant protein was designated as SE3N, SE4N, or SE6N. Each recombinant protein gave a single band with an expected molecular mass as follows: SE3N, 28 kDa; SE4N, 30 kDa; SE6N, 33 kDa. After they were concentrated to 1 mg/ml by Centriprep YM-10 (Millipore Corp.), each purified recombinant protein was used for the custom antibody preparation (Asahi Techno Glass). Purification of total IgG from each serum was performed with a HiTrap Protein G column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the methods described previously (7Pang X.L. Mitamura T. Horii T. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1821-1827Google Scholar). Preparation of recombinant SE47′ protein and affinity-purified mouse and rabbit anti-SE47′ antibodies was previously described (10Sugiyama T. Suzue K. Okamoto M. Inselburg J. Tai K. Horii T. Vaccine. 1996; 14: 1069-1076Google Scholar). Recombinant protein of block 17 in merozoite surface protein-1 (rMSP-119) was prepared in the silkworm,Bombyx mori, as follows. Genomic DNA of the P. falciparum MAD 20 strain was used for PCR to obtain DNA fragments encoding signal sequence (Met 1–Leu32) and block 17 (Pro1571–Gly1686) of MSP-1 (31Mitamura T. Hanada K. Ko-Mitamura E.P. Nishijima M. Horii T. Parasitol. Int. 2000; 49: 219-229Google Scholar). The obtained DNA fragments were connected with spacer nucleotides, GGAATT (encoding Gly-Ile), and then ligated to plasmid pBm030 (37Maeda S. Kawai T. Obinata M. Fujiwara H. Horiuchi T. Saeki Y. Sato Y. Furusawa M. Nature. 1985; 315: 592-594Google Scholar). The constructed plasmid was co-transfected with a wild type of B. mori nuclear polyhedrosis virus into an insect cell line, BmN4 (Funakoshi), and the recombinant virus was purified by plaque assay (37Maeda S. Kawai T. Obinata M. Fujiwara H. Horiuchi T. Saeki Y. Sato Y. Furusawa M. Nature. 1985; 315: 592-594Google Scholar). The purified recombinant virus was injected into silk worms on the first day of the fifth larval instar (5 × 104plaque-forming units/worm). Hemolymph was collected 4 days later. An affinity purification column was prepared with Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) and MSP-1 block 17 specific monoclonal antibody 5.2 purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). With the affinity column, recombinant MSP-1 was purified from the hemolymph according to the manufacturer's instructions. 10 μg of purified rMSP-1 was obtained from 1 ml of the hemolymph. 100 μl of 1 μg/ml each recombinant protein (SE3N, SE4N, SE47′, SE6N, or MSP-119) was used as antigens to coat each well of a 96-well microtiter plate. The second antibody used was biotinylated goat IgG specific to human IgG (γ chain) (Vector Laboratories), and color development was conducted using Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) with 2,2′-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) as a substrate. ELISA titers were determined by a cut-off absorbance of 0.2 at 412 nm with a microtiter plate reader (Titertek Multiskan MCC/340 MKII). For Western blot, Percoll-purified trophozoite and schizont stage parasites were lysed in SDS buffer and loaded onto 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Membrane transfer, primary antibody binding, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody binding, followed by color development with the DAB substrate kit (Funakoshi, Japan), were according to the methods described (9Li J. Matsuoka H. Mitamura T. Horii T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 120: 177-186Google Scholar). Percoll-purified trophozoite- and schizont-infected erythrocytes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS on ice for 30 min, spread onto slides, and air-dried. To permeabilize cells, samples were treated with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 (7Pang X.L. Mitamura T. Horii T. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1821-1827Google Scholar). Slides were blocked with PBS containing 3% BSA (buffer E) for 1 h and subsequently reacted with the affinity-purified mouse SE47′-specific IgG and either rabbit α-SE3N serum, rabbit α-SE4N serum, or rabbit α-SE6N serum. All of the rabbit antisera used were diluted at 1:1000, and the concentration of the purified mouse IgG used was 1 μg/ml in buffer E. The slides reacted with two primary antibodies were washed five times with PBS and then incubated in buffer E containing 1000-fold diluted Cy3-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma), 100-fold diluted fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (Sigma), and 1 μg/ml 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma). After five washes with PBS, the slides were mounted with PermaFluorTM Aqueous Mounting Medium (ImmunonTM). Fluorescence microscopy was performed by using an Axioskop fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss). Images were recorded by an AxioCam MRm CCD camera (Carl Zeiss). Individual sera from Ugandans were collected from 40 healthy adults (age >18 years) living in Atopi Parish, a malaria holoendemic area, located 5 km west of Apac Town, 300 km north of Kampala. Blood samples were obtained with informed consent (and approval by the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology) by venipuncture and collected in Vacutainers containing EDTA. Serum samples were separated into fresh serum vials and stored at −20 °C. The parasite growth inhibition assay was performed in a 96-well microtiter plate with FCR3, Honduras-1, and K1 parasite strains. Individual Ugandan serum samples were added at 5% (v/v) to the parasite culture containing 3% erythrocyte with 0.3–0.5% trophozoite- and schizont-rich cells and incubated for 24 h. Japanese malaria naive serum was used as control. Parasitized erythrocytes were counted in Giemsa-stained thin smears, and the parasitemia was scored by counting over 5000 erythrocytes in a slide. The growth inhibition (%) is calculated by (A −B)/A × 100, where A andB are control parasitemia (%) and parasitemia from sample (%), respectively. Correlation coefficients (r) were calculated using Pearson's test for pairs of logarithm of ELISA titers to base 2 and the parasite growth inhibition (%). The pvalues under 0.05 are considered significant. Transcriptional activity of each gene belonging to the SERA multigene family on chromosome 2 was examined by RT-PCR (Fig.1). Three parasite strains representative of typical SERA5 allelic forms, Honduras-1, K1, and FCR3, as well as two standard strains, Dd2 and 3D7, were used as total RNA templates for RT-PCR. When 20 ng of total RNA was used for the reverse transcriptase reaction, the 40 cycles of PCR could yield all of the expected products corresponding to SERA1–8 genes (data not shown), demonstrating that SERA1–8 genes are active in transcription. To estimate relative transcriptional activities ofSERA1–8 genes in each five parasite strains, PCR cycles were reduced to 20. As an internal control, the conserved region of MSP-1, block 3–5, was amplified with corresponding specific primers. As shown in Fig. 2, it appeared thatSERA5 was predominantly transcribed among SERA family genes and that the activities were followed by the adjacent SERA4, -3, -6, and -7 without any significant difference among five parasite strains examined. The observed transcription profiles were further confirmed by Northern blot analysis of total RNA prepared from three representative parasite strains (Fig.3). Northern blot indicates that theSERA5 transcription is severalfold higher than the internal control, MSP-1 gene.Figure 3Northern blot of SERA1–8genes in three parasite strains. Northern blot analysis ofSERA1–8 genes was carried out with total RNA (1 μg/lane). RNA was prepared from Percoll-purified trophozoite- and schizont-infected erythrocyte of parasite strains K1 (K), Honduras-1 (H), and FCR3 (F). The blotted membrane was probed with each of the radiolabeled PCR products ofSERA1–8 genes and MSP-1 that were radiolabeled in a single tube to keep a specific radioactivity of both probes constant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Since we have obtained consistent results with semiquantitative RT-PCR and Northern blot experiments, we carried out real time PCR for more quantitative comparison of the transcriptions among the SERA multigene family. In this experiment, the ninth SERA homologue, which was on chromosome 9 through the genome data base search (available on the World Wide Web at www.PlasmodDB.org), was also included (SERA9). To avoid possible inaccuracies caused by hybridization efficiency of primers used in above described RT-PCR, we prepared the new primer sets for each SERA gene except forSERA7. The new primer sets were designed to amplify the 3′-proximal region of each gene, because oligo(dT)-primed cDNA was used for the real time PCR. Based on the reproducible results from three independent experiments, the transcription profiles ofSERA1–8 genes are conserved in all of the parasite strains examined (Fig. 4). These results were consistent with the previous experiments described above. However,SERA9 and MSP-1 gene transcriptions varied from experiment to experiment and in parasite strains as well (Fig. 4). The stage specificity of each gene expression may largely affect the expression profile, especially SERA9 and MSP-1 genes; therefore, total RNA prepared from the tightly synchronized parasite cells were subjected to real time quantitative PCR. Ring, early trophozoite, late trophozoite, and schizont stage parasites were harvested, respectively, at 8, 15, 29, and 34 h after reinvasion. Fig. 5 showed the amount of each SERA gene transcript relative to that of the SERA5 gene detected at the late trophozoite stage as 100%. All of the SERA genes were transcribed at late trophozoite and schizont stages but not at ring and early trophozoite stages. The transcription of the MSP-1 gene was mainly at schizont stage. SERA3, SERA4, SERA5, and SERA6 genes were significantly transcribed in all of the parasite strains examined. To analyze the protei"

To uncover the underlying molecular causes, we determined the crystal structures of the disease-associated B*2705 and the nonassociated B*2709 subtypes complexed with the same nonapeptide (GRFAAAIAK). Both differ in only one residue (Asp116 and His116, respectively) in the F-pocket that accommodates the peptide C terminus. Several different effects of the Asp116 → His replacement are observed. The bulkier His116 induces a movement of peptide C-terminal pLys9, allowing the formation of a novel salt bridge to Asp77, whereas the salt bridge between pLys9 and Asp116 is converted into a hydrogen bond with His116. His116 but not Asp116 adopts two alternative conformations, one of which leads to breakage of hydrogen bonds. Water molecules near residue 116 differ with regard to number, position, and contacts made. Furthermore, F-pocket atoms exhibit higher B-factors in B*2709 than in B*2705, indicating an increased flexibility of the entire region in the former subtype. These changes induce subtle peptide conformational alterations that may be responsible for the immunobiological differences between these HLA-B27 subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W2036035271,"Gemfibrozil, a lipid-lowering drug, inhibited cytokine-induced production of NO and the expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) in human U373MG astroglial cells and primary astrocytes. Similar to gemfibrozil, clofibrate, another fibrate drug, also inhibited the expression of iNOS. Inhibition of human iNOS promoter-driven luciferase activity by gemfibrozil in cytokine-stimulated U373MG astroglial cells suggests that this compound inhibits the transcription of iNOS. Since gemfibrozil is known to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α), we investigated the role of PPAR-α in gemfibrozil-mediated inhibition of iNOS. Gemfibrozil induced peroxisome proliferator-responsive element (PPRE)-dependent luciferase activity, which was inhibited by the expression of ΔhPPAR-α, the dominant-negative mutant of human PPAR-α. However, ΔhPPAR-α was unable to abrogate gemfibrozil-mediated inhibition of iNOS suggesting that gemfibrozil inhibits iNOS independent of PPAR-α. The human iNOS promoter contains consensus sequences for the binding of transcription factors, including interferon-γ (IFN-γ) regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) binding to interferon-stimulated responsive element (ISRE), signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) binding to γ-activation site (GAS), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), activator protein-1 (AP-1), and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ); therefore, we investigated the effect of gemfibrozil on the activation of these transcription factors. The combination of interleukin (IL)-1β and IFN-γ induced the activation of NF-κB, AP-1, C/EBPβ, and GAS but not that of ISRE, suggesting that IRF-1 may not be involved in cytokine-induced expression of iNOS in human astrocytes. Interestingly, gemfibrozil strongly inhibited the activation of NF-κB, AP-1, and C/EBPβ but not that of GAS in cytokine-stimulated astroglial cells. These results suggest that gemfibrozil inhibits the induction of iNOS probably by inhibiting the activation of NF-κB, AP-1, and C/EBPβ and that gemfibrozil, a prescribed drug for humans, may further find its therapeutic use in neuroinflammatory diseases.

Although the NO produced by iNOS has bactericidal and tumoricidal properties, it also plays an important role in pathophysiologies of inflammatory neurological diseases including demyelinating disorders (e.g. multiple sclerosis, experimental allergic encephalopathy), neurodegenerative disorder like Alzheimer's disease, and in ischemic and traumatic brain injuries associated with the activation of glial cells and the production of proinflammatory cytokines (5Mitrovic B.

Therefore, characterization of intracellular pathways required to transduce the signal from the cell surface to the nucleus for the induction of iNOS is an active area of investigation, since compounds capable of antagonizing signaling steps for the induction of iNOS may have therapeutic effect in NO-mediated pathophysiological conditions. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, have been implicated in a variety of human diseases (9Lemberger T. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 335-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Three isotypes have been described to date, PPAR-α, PPAR-β, and PPAR-γ (9Lemberger T. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 335-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Activation of PPAR-α mainly leads to the induction of a variety of genes such as those coding for the enzymes for β- and ω-oxidation of fatty acids (10Dreyer C. Krey G. Keller H. Givel F. Helftenbein G. Wahli W. Cell. 1992; 68: 879-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar). Gemfibrozil, an activator of PPAR-α, has been often prescribed in patients to lower the level of triglycerides (11Hsu H.C. Lee Y.T. Yeh H.T. Chen M.F. J. Lab. Clin.

Wexler L. Wagner S. Papademetriou V. Rutan G. Robins S.J. Circulation. 2001; 103: 2828-2833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of PPAR-α is also capable of modifying the stress response by activation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1) and induction of HSP70 (13Amici C. Sistonen L. Santoro M.G. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6227-6231Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 14Elia G. Amici C. Rossi A. Santoro M.G. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 210-217PubMed Google Scholar). Recently it has been shown that activation of HSP70 inhibits the expression of iNOS in astrocytes (15Feinstein D.L. Galea E. Aquino D.A. Li G.C. Xu H. Reis D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17724-17732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), suggesting that the expression of iNOS may also be regulated by activators of PPAR-α. Therefore, we investigated the effect of gemfibrozil on the expression of iNOS in cytokine-stimulated human U373MG astroglial cells and primary astrocytes. In the current work, we present evidence that gemfibrozil markedly inhibited the expression of iNOS and the production of NO in human astrocytes independent of PPAR-α. In addition, reporter gene assays reveal that gemfibrozil specifically inhibited cytokine-induced activation of NF-κB, AP-1, and C/EBPβ but not that of GAS. These results raise the possibility that gemfibrozil, a common lipid-lowering drug, may be of therapeutic value in human neuroinflammatory diseases.

Antibodies against human macrophage iNOS were obtained fromCalbiochem. 125I-Labeled protein A and [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Peroxisome proliferator-responsive element (PPRE)-dependent reporter construct (tk-PPREx3-Luc) and dominant-negative mutant of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (ΔC/EBPβ) were kindly provided by Dr. Ronald M. Evans of The Salk Institute and Dr. Steve Smale of the University of California at Los Angeles, respectively. Human CNS tissue was obtained from the Human Embryology Laboratory, University of Washington, Seattle. The CNS tissue from each specimen was processed separately and independently, as were subsequent cell cultures; there was no pooling of CNS tissue from distinct specimens. All the experimental protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB number 224-01-FB) of the University of Nebraska Medical Center. These cells were grown in a serum-free, defined medium (B16) enriched with 5 ng of basic fibroblast growth factor per ml for optimal growth of astrocytes and for the suppression of fibroblast growth (16McCarthy M. Wood C. Fedoseyeva L. Whittemore S. J. Neurovirol. 1995; 1: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). By immunofluorescence assay, these cultures homogeneously expressed glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Cells were trypsinized, subcultured, and stimulated with cytokines in serum-free DMEM/F-12 medium to induce the production of NO. The human U373MG astrocytoma cell line, purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), was also maintained and stimulated under similar conditions. Synthesis of NO was determined by assay of culture supernatant for nitrite, a stable reaction product of NO with molecular oxygen, using Griess reagent (1Feinstein D.L. Galea E. Roberts S.

Briefly, 400 μl of culture supernatant was allowed to react with 200 μl of Griess reagent and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The optical density of the assay samples was measured spectrophotometrically at 570 nm. Fresh culture medium served as the blank in all experiments. Nitrite concentrations were calculated from a standard curve derived from the reaction of NaNO2 in the assay. Protein was measured by the procedure of Bradford (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis for iNOS was carried out as described earlier (2Pahan K. Sheikh F.G. Namboodiri A.M.S. Singh I. J. Clin.

Briefly, cells were detached by scraping, washed with Hanks' buffer, and homogenized in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml antipain, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). After electrophoresis the proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and the iNOS band was visualized by immunoblotting with antibodies against human iNOS and125I-labeled protein A (2Pahan K.

Cells were taken out of the culture dishes directly by adding Ultraspec-II RNA reagent (Biotecx Laboratories, Inc.), and total RNA was isolated using Ultraspec-II RNA reagent (Biotecx Laboratories Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For Northern blot analyses, 20 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on 1.2% denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gels, electrotransferred to Hybond-Nylon Membrane (AmershamBiosciences) and hybridized at 68 °C with32P-labeled cDNA probe using Express Hyb hybridization solution (Clontech) as described by the manufacturer. The cDNA probe was made by polymerase chain reaction amplification using two primers (forward primer, 5′-CTC CTT CAA AGA GGC AAA AAT A-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CAC TTC CTC CAG GAT GTT GT-3′) (2Pahan K.

After hybridization filters were washed two or three times in solution I (2× SSC, 0.05% SDS) for 1 h at room temperature followed by solution II (0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS) at 50 °C for another hour. The membranes were then dried and exposed to x-ray films (Eastman Kodak Co.). The same amount of RNA was hybridized with probe for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Construction of phiNOS(7.2)Luc, the 7.2-kb human iNOS promoter-luciferase construct, has been described previously (19Taylor B.S. de Vera M.E. Ganster R.W. Wang Q. Shapiro R.A. Morris S.M. Billiar T.R. Geller D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15148-15156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Cells plated at 50–60% confluence in six-well plates were cotransfected with 1 μg of phiNOS(7.2)Luc and 50 ng of pRL-TK (a plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase, used as transfection efficiency control; Promega) by LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) following manufacturer's protocol (3Pahan K.

Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were treated with different stimuli for 12 h. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were obtained by analyzing total cell extract according to standard instructions provided in the Dual Luciferase Kit (Promega) in a TD-20/20 Luminometer (Turner Designs). Relative luciferase activity of cell extracts was typically represented as the ratio of firefly luciferase value/Renilla luciferase value × 10−3. Cells plated at 50–60% confluence in six-well plates were cotransfected with 1 μg of either pNF-κB-Luc (NF-κB-dependent reporter construct), pAP-1-Luc (AP-1-dependent reporter construct), pC/EBPβ-Luc (C/EBPβ-dependent reporter construct), pGAS-Luc (GAS-dependent reporter construct), or pISRE-Luc (ISRE-dependent reporter construct) and 50 ng of pRL-TK using LipofectAMINE Plus. Construction of pC/EBPβ-Luc has been described earlier (4Jana M. Liu X. Koka S. Ghosh S. Petro T.M. Pahan K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44527-44533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This C/EBPβ-sensitive promoter contains four consensus C/EBPβ-binding sites. Other reporter constructs (pNF-κB-Luc, pAP-1-Luc, pGAS-Luc, and pISRE-Luc) were obtained from Stratagene. After 24 h of transfection, cells were treated with different stimuli for 6 h. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were obtained as described above. Statistical comparisons were made using one-way analysis of variance followed by Student's t test. Cells were cultured in serum-free media in the presence of IL-1β and IFN-γ. It is evident from Table I that IL-1β and IFN-γ alone were poor inducers of NO production. However, marked induction of NO production was observed by the combination of IL-1β and IFN-γ. This combination of cytokines was used to induce the production of NO in subsequent studies. The inhibition of cytokine-induced production of NO by arginase (an enzyme that degrades the substrate,l-arginine, of NOS) and l-NMA (a competitive inhibitor of NOS) but not by d-NMA (a negative control ofl-NMA) suggests that the combination of IL-1β and IFN-γ induces the production of NO in U373MG astroglial cells through NOS-mediated arginine metabolism (Table I). Next we examined the effect of gemfibrozil, an activator of PPAR-α (20Kliewer S.A. Forman B.M. Blumberg B. Ong E.S. Borgmeyer U. Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7355-7359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar), on the cytokine-induced nitrite production in U373MG glial cells. Gemfibrozil itself was neither stimulatory nor much inhibitory to NO production in control cells. However, gemfibrozil, when added 2 h before the addition of cytokines, markedly inhibited cytokine-induced production of NO (TableI).Table IInduction of NO production in human U373MG astroglial cellsTreatmentsNitrite productionμg/mg protein/24 hControl6.2 ± 0.8IL-1β only18.6 ± 1.9IFN-γ only15.9 ± 0.9IL-1β + IFN-γ196.3 ± 26.6IL-1β + IFN-γ + arginase21.2 ± 1.8ap < 0.001 versusIL-1β + IFN-γ.IL-1β + IFN-γ +l-NMA19.1 ± 2.1ap < 0.001 versusIL-1β + IFN-γ.IL-1β + IFN-γ +d-NMA194.7 ± 21.3Gemfibrozil only5.9 ± 1.1IL-1β + IFN-γ + gemfibrozil20.8 ± 2.8ap < 0.001 versusIL-1β + IFN-γ.U373MG glial cells preincubated in serum-free DMEM/F-12 for 1 h with arginase, l-NMA or d-NMA received the combination of IL-1β and IFN-γ. After 24 h of incubation, nitrite concentrations in the supernatants were measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of three different experiments. The concentrations of different compounds were as follows: IL-1β, 10 ng/ml; IFN-γ, 10 units/ml; arginase, 100 units/ml; l-NMA, 0.1 mm;d-NMA, 0.1 mm; gemfibrozil, 200 μm.a p < 0.001 versusIL-1β + IFN-γ.

The concentrations of different compounds were as follows: IL-1β, 10 ng/ml; IFN-γ, 10 units/ml; arginase, 100 units/ml; l-NMA, 0.1 mm;d-NMA, 0.1 mm; gemfibrozil, 200 μm. To determine whether inhibition of cytokine-induced NO production by gemfibrozil was simply due to delayed induction, we measured NO concentrations in cytokine-stimulated cultures maintained up to 48 h. When cells were stimulated in the absence of gemfibrozil, NO was detected in culture supernatants after 8 h and increased progressively thereafter for 48 h, the duration of the experiment (Fig. 1). However, when 200 μm gemfibrozil was added 2 h before the addition of the combination of IL-1β and IFN-γ, production of NO was significantly inhibited (Fig. 1). In our studies, maximal suppression of NO production was observed when gemfibrozil was added 2 h before the addition of cytokines (data not shown). When gemfibrozil was added after the addition of cytokines, the extent of inhibition progressively decreased (data not shown). It is evident from Fig.2 A that gemfibrozil dose-dependently inhibited cytokine-induced production of NO. Although at 50 μm concentration, gemfibrozil was not a potent inhibitor of cytokine-induced NO production, it inhibited the induction of NO production by more than 80% at 200 μmconcentration. To understand the mechanism of inhibition, we examined the effect of gemfibrozil on protein and mRNA level of iNOS in cytokine-stimulated cells. Consistent with the effect of gemfibrozil on cytokine-induced production of NO, gemfibrozil dose-dependently inhibited cytokine-induced expression of iNOS protein (Fig. 2 B) and mRNA (Fig.2 C).Figure 2Gemfibrozil dose-dependently inhibits the expression of iNOS in cytokine-stimulated human U373MG astroglial cells.

Human U373MG astroglial cells were stimulated with the combination of IL-1β and IFN-γ under serum-free condition. After 6 h of stimulation, cells were treated with actinomycin D (an inhibitor of RNA synthesis) in the presence or absence of 200 μm of gemfibrozil. At different h of treatment with actinomycin D, the level of iNOS mRNA was analyzed by Northern blot. It is apparent from figure 3, A and B, that the relative rate of degradation of iNOS mRNA (iNOS/GAPDH) in the presence or absence of gemfibrozil at different time periods remained almost same suggesting that gemfibrozil-mediated inhibition of iNOS mRNA is not due to any alteration of the stability of iNOS mRNA. To investigate whether other fibrate drugs are also capable of inhibiting cytokine-induced production of NO and expression of iNOS in astrocytes, we examined the effect of clofibrate. Clofibrate is also a hypolipidemic drug that activates PPAR-α and induces proliferation of peroxisomes in rats and mice (9Lemberger T. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 335-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 20Kliewer S.A. Forman B.M. Blumberg B. Ong E.S. Borgmeyer U. Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Similar to gemfibrozil, clofibrate itself was neither stimulatory nor much inhibitory to NO production; however, it dose-dependently inhibited the production of NO (Fig.4 A) and the expression of iNOS protein (Fig. 4 B) in cytokine-stimulated U373MG astroglial cells. These studies suggest that fibrate drugs, in general, are inhibitory to cytokine-induced expression of iNOS in human astroglial cells. Human primary astrocytes have been shown to induce the expression of iNOS in the presence of different proinflammatory cytokines (22Pahan K. Liu X. McKinney M. Wood C. Sheikh F.G. Raymond J.R. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2288-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 23Pahan K. Liu X. Wood C. Raymond J.R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 24Zhao M.L.

Since gemfibrozil potently inhibited the expression of iNOS in human U373MG astroglial cells, we examined the effect of gemfibrozil on cytokine-induced expression of iNOS in human primary astrocytes. Different cytokines alone were poor inducers of NO production (Table II). However, the combination of IL-1β and IFN-γ markedly induced the production of NO. The addition of TNF-α to the combination of IL-1β and IFN-γ did not further increase the production of NO (Table II). Although gemfibrozil itself had no effect on NO production in control cells, preincubation of human primary astrocytes with 200 μm of gemfibrozil for 2 h markedly inhibited cytokine-induced production of NO (Table II).Table IIGemfibrozil inhibits the induction of NO production in human primary astrocytesTreatmentsNitrite productionμg/mg protein/24 hControl5.3 ± 0.7IL-1β24.5 ± 2.5IFN-γ6.1 ± 0.7TNF-α5.8 ± 0.8Gemfibrozil5.1 ± 0.6IL-1β + IFN-γ215.3 ± 22.3IL-1β + IFN-γ + TNF-α219.2 ± 28.5IL-1β + IFN-γ + gemfibrozil24.8 ± 2.8ap < 0.001 versusIL-1β + IFN-γ.IL-1β + IFN-γ + TNF-α + gemfibrozil25.7 ± 3.1bp < 0.001 versus IL-1β + IFN-γ + TNF-α.Human primary astrocytes preincubated in serum-free DMEM/F-12 for 2 h with 200 μm gemfibrozil, received IL-1β, IFN-γ, and TNF-α alone or in different combinations.

https://openalex.org/W2057566423,"The Lutheran blood group glycoprotein (Lu), also known as basal cell adhesion molecule, is an Ig superfamily transmembrane receptor for laminin α5. Lu is expressed on the surface of a subset of muscle and epithelial cells in diverse tissues and is thought to be involved in both normal and disease processes, including sickle cell disease and cancer. Here we investigated the binding of Lu to laminin α5 in vivo and in vitro. We prepared a soluble recombinant Lu (sol-Lu) composed of the Lu extracellular domain and a His6 tag. Sol-Lu bound specifically to laminin-10/11 (α5β1/β2γ1) in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and bound to bona fide basement membranes containing laminin α5 in tissue sections. Sol-Lu did not bind to tissue sections of laminin α5 knockout embryos, despite the fact that the four other α chains were present. To identify the Lu-binding site on laminin α5, we prepared modified α5 cDNAs encoding chimeric laminins containing all or part of the laminin α1 G domain in place of the analogous α5 regions. These constructs were used to generate transgenic mice. Proteins derived from transgenes were detected in basement membranes and were assayed for their ability to bind Lu by examining the localization of endogenous Lu and the binding of sol-Lu applied to tissue sections. Our results demonstrate that the α5 LG3 module is essential for Lu binding to laminin α5."

The enterovirus genome contains one large open reading frame that is translated into a single, 220-kDa polyprotein. Processing of the polyprotein by virus-encoded proteases yields the structural P1 region proteins that encapsidate the viral RNA and the non-structural P2 and P3 region proteins that are involved in replication of the viral RNA. Processing of the P2 and P3 regions yields the 2Apro, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3Cpro, and 3Dpol proteins and the more stable cleavage intermediates 2BC, 3AB, and 3CDpro, which have functions distinct from their cleavage products. Although multiple functions have been attributed to the mature viral proteins and the cleavage intermediates, the exact function of most of the viral proteins in the replication cycle is still largely unknown.Host cell membranes are subject to a number of profound alterations upon enterovirus infection. Enteroviruses gradually modify host cell membrane permeability and rearrange intracellular membranes during infection. The modification of the plasma membrane permeability is most likely important for the lysis of the cell and the release of virus progeny. Modifications of secretory pathway membranes are connected to viral functions such as genome replication. The modification of host cell membrane permeability is such that initially calcium is released from intracellular stores (1van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Hoenderop J.G.J. Smeets R.L.L. Willems P.H.G.M. Dijkman H.B.P.M. Galama J.M.D. Melchers W.J.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3519-3532Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Ionic gradients maintained by the plasma membrane are also disrupted (2Carrasco L. Adv. Virus Res. 1995; 45: 61-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Also, later in infection, small compounds such as hygromycin B, a small non-permeative translation inhibitor, can efficiently enter the cell. The 2B protein has been identified as the viral protein that is responsible for the alterations in host cell membrane permeability that take place in enterovirus-infected cells. Individual expression of the 2B protein was shown to be sufficient for the release of calcium from intracellular stores and the increase in plasma membrane permeability to both calcium and hygromycin B (1van Kuppeveld F.J.M.

These vesicles are derived from the secretory pathway (7Schlegel A. Giddings T.H. Ladinsky M.S. Kirkegaard K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6576-6588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were shown to be the site at which viral RNA replication takes place (8Bienz K. Egger D. Pfister T. Arch. Virol.

Virol. 2000; 74: 8953-8965Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The virus-induced inhibition of protein secretion is another important modification, affecting trafficking of host cell membranes. This inhibition may be advantageous for the virus by preventing anti-viral host cell responses such as major histocompatibility complex expression and secretion of interferon and interleukines (14Deitz S.B.

Virol. 2001; 75: 8158-8165Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Individual expression of the enterovirus non-structural proteins has shown that both the 2B protein and the 3A protein are endowed with the ability to inhibit protein secretion (1van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Hoenderop J.G.J. Smeets R.L.L. Willems P.H.G.M. Dijkman H.B.P.M. Galama J.M.D. Melchers W.J.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3519-3532Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar,3Doedens J.R. Kirkegaard K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 894-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The 3A protein was shown to inhibit ER-to-Golgi transport (16Doedens J.R. Giddings T.H. Kirkegaard K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9054-9064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The step blocked by the 2B protein is still unknown.The mechanism by which the enterovirus 2B protein exerts its effects on membranes is as yet unknown. Moreover, it remains to be established whether the different activities of the 2B protein (i.e.membrane permeabilization, membrane rearrangement, and secretion inhibition) represent different functions or whether these activities are the result of a general membrane-disturbing activity of the 2B protein. Our aim is to gain more insight into the structure and function of the coxsackievirus 2B protein. The coxsackievirus 2B protein is a small protein of 99 amino acids that, in the infected cell, is present at the virus-induced, secretory pathway-derived membrane vesicles at which the viral replication takes place (17Bienz K. Egger D. Pasamontes L. Virology. 1987; 160: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The protein contains two hydrophobic regions (Fig. 1), of which one is predicted to form a cationic amphipathic α-helix with characteristics typical of the group of the so-called membrane-lytic peptides (18van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Galama J.M.D. Zoll J. van den Hurk P.J.J.C. Melchers W.J.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3876-3886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in the amphipathic α-helix or the second hydrophobic region were shown to have deleterious effects on viral RNA replication and virus growth, indicating that the integrity of these regions is essential for an early function in the viral life cycle (18van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Galama J.M.D. Zoll J. van den Hurk P.J.J.C. Melchers W.J.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3876-3886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Galama J.M.D. Zoll J. Melchers W.J.G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7782-7790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in these domains were also found to interfere with the ability of the 2B protein to increase membrane permeability and to inhibit protein secretion (6van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Melchers W.J.G. Kirkegaard K. Doedens J.R. Virology. 1997; 227: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This strongly suggests that the membrane-modifying activities of the 2B protein are in some way required for the accumulation of the membrane vesicles at which viral RNA replication takes place.At present, the determinants for the membrane interaction and the subcellular localization of the 2B protein have not been defined. In this study, we have investigated the mode of membrane associationin vivo and the subcellular localization of the 2B protein. Furthermore, by testing 2B deletion mutants, we have analyzed the importance of specific domains for the mode of membrane interaction, the subcellular localization, and the ability to increase membrane permeability. Moreover, the correlation between the subcellular localization and the membrane-active character of the 2B protein was determined.DISCUSSIONThe enterovirus 2B protein is responsible for the alterations in the permeability of secretory membranes and the plasma membrane that are observed in infected cells (1van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Hoenderop J.G.J. Smeets R.L.L. Willems P.H.G.M. Dijkman H.B.P.M. Galama J.M.D. Melchers W.J.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3519-3532Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 3Doedens J.R. Kirkegaard K.

Melchers W.J.G. Kirkegaard K. Doedens J.R. Virology. 1997; 227: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism by which the 2B protein disturbs host cell membranes is largely unknown. In this study, we have investigated the structural and functional requirements for the in vivo membrane association and the membrane-active function of this important virus protein.The membrane association of the 2B protein was resistant against extraction with buffers that release peripherally associated membrane proteins, indicating that one or more domains of the protein are embedded in the phospholipid bilayer rather than that the protein associates with membranes through electrostatic interactions with membrane proteins or polar lipid head groups. Expression of deletion mutants and heterologous proteins showed that each of the hydrophobic regions HR1 and HR2 alone could mediate membrane binding. However, in contrast to the wild-type 2B protein, a substantial amount of the 2B proteins lacking either HR1 or HR2 was released upon Na2CO3 extraction, indicating that both hydrophobic regions are required for the correct membrane association. Moreover, the presence of both HR1 and HR2 was absolutely required for the membrane-active function of the 2B protein, consistent with previous reports (6van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Melchers W.J.G. Kirkegaard K. Doedens J.R. Virology. 1997; 227: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 11Barco A. Carrasco L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3349-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Together, these findings suggest that the two hydrophobic regions are cooperatively involved in the formation of a membrane-integral complex and that the formation of this complex is required for the membrane association and membrane-active function of the 2B protein.These findings provide important new insights into the molecular architecture of the 2B protein in the membrane. The first hydrophobic region of the 2B protein has been predicted to form a cationic amphipathic α-helix that shows similarities with the group of lytic polypeptides (18van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Galama J.M.D. Zoll J. van den Hurk P.J.J.C. Melchers W.J.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3876-3886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Amphipathic α-helical lytic polypeptides may form multimers that build membrane-integral pores by exposing their hydrophobic sides to the lipid bilayer, whereas their hydrophilic faces form an aqueous interior (25Shai Y. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 460-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 26Shai Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar, 27Segrest J.P., De- Loof H. Dohlman J.G. Brouillette C.G. Anantharamaiah G.M. Proteins. 1990; 8: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The 2B protein has been shown to form homo-multimers by yeast two-hybrid analysis (28Cuconati A. Xiang W. Lahser F. Pfister T. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1297-1307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), mammalian two-hybrid analysis (21De Jong A.S. Schrama I.W.J. Willems P.H.G.M. Galama J.M.D. Melchers W.J.G. van Kuppeveld F.J.M. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 783-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and in living mammalian cells using fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy (29van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Melchers W.J.G. Willems P.H.G.M. Gadella T.W.J., Jr. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9446-9456Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The behavior of the 2B protein as an integral membrane protein and the observation that each of the hydrophobic regions HR1 and HR2 can independently mediate membrane binding lend support to the idea that multimers of protein 2B build membrane-integral pores and that each of these hydrophobic regions is involved in the formation of these pore complexes. Fig. 9 shows a model of a multimeric pore complex formed by 2B proteins. According to this model, HR1 and HR2 interact with each other to form a “helix-loop-helix” hairpin motif that traverses the lipid bilayer. The hydrophobic regions are separated by a hydrophilic loop sequence (RNHDD in the CVB3 2B protein). Presumably both the N and C terminus of the 2B protein reside at the cytosolic side of the membrane. This suggestion is supported by the observation that a cytosolic ER retention signal (KKAA) (23Andersson H. Kappeler F. Hauri H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15080-15084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 30Hauri H.P. Kappeler F. Andersson H. Appenzeller C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 587-596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at the C terminus of the 2B protein is functional in conferring ER retention to the 2B protein. Furthermore, the lack of glycosylation at NX(S/T) glycosylation signals introduced at different positions in the region upstream HR1 argues that the N terminus is localized at the cytosolic side of the membrane. 2A. S. de Jong and F. J. M. van Kuppeveld, unpublished results. Finally, localization of the N and C terminus at the cytosolic side of the membrane is consistent with the need of proteolytic liberation of the 2B protein from the viral polyprotein by the viral protein 3Cpro, a cytosolic protease. Both the membrane association and the membrane-active function were independent of the C-terminal 15 amino acids. Although dispensable for the membrane association, the N-terminal 20 amino acids were found to be of importance for the membrane-active function of the 2B protein, indicating that the molecular structure and function of the 2B protein depend on more than just the presence of HR1 and HR2 and therefore require further investigation.Figure 9Pore forming model for the membrane-active 2B protein. A multimeric complex of four 2B monomers is shown in a helix-loop-helix conformation. Of each monomer, the hydrophobic regions span the lipid bilayer and are spaced by a short loop sequence. The N and C terminus of the 2B monomers are facing the same side of the membrane. The hydrophilic faces of the amphipatic α-helix of the monomers are facing each other, thereby creating an aqueous interior or pore. This structural model is consistent with the ability of the 2B protein to modify membrane permeability and the observation that both hydrophobic regions are involved in the function and the topological architecture of the 2B protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Upon expression in the absence of other viral proteins, the CVB3 2B protein was localizing in the Golgi complex, consistent with the Golgi localization described for the 2B protein of the closely related poliovirus (31Sandoval I.V. Carrasco L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4679-4693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Retention of the 2B protein in the ER by fusion of an ER retention signal severely inhibited the ability to increase plasma membrane permeability. This activity, however, was unaffected when the 2B protein was exclusively targeted to the Golgi complex by fusion of a Golgi targeting signal. This strongly suggests that the Golgi complex is the target organelle of the 2B protein to exert its effect on the plasma membrane. It is remarkable that a virus protein that is localized at the Golgi complex can modify plasma membrane permeability. The mechanism underlying this activity is as yet unknown. We predict that this activity is somehow linked to the ability of the 2B protein to increase Golgi membrane permeability. Previously, we have shown that expression of the 2B protein resulted in a decrease in the amount of calcium that could be released from thapsigargin-sensitive stores (1van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Hoenderop J.G.J. Smeets R.L.L. Willems P.H.G.M. Dijkman H.B.P.M. Galama J.M.D. Melchers W.J.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3519-3532Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Because at that time only the ER was recognized as a thapsigargin-sensitive store (32Lytton J. Westlin M. Auley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17067-17071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we concluded that the 2B protein modified ER membrane permeability. Recently, however, the Golgi complex was also identified as a thapsigargin-sensitive intracellular calcium store (33Pinton P. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5298-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). This finding, together with the identification of the Golgi complex as the main target organelle of the 2B protein, suggests that the 2B protein causes an increased Golgi membrane permeability and a general disruption of the ionic gradients maintained by the Golgi membrane. Alterations in ionic gradients maintained by membranes of the Golgi complex have been demonstrated to result in functional disturbances of the Golgi complex. Disruption of cationic gradients by monensin, an H+/Na+ ionophore that mediates cation diffusion over Golgi membranes, results in the inhibition of complex glycosylation in the Golgi complex (reflected by the inability of secretory proteins to acquire resistance to endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H treatment) and inhibition of protein secretion (34Dinter A. Berger E.G. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 109: 571-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Analogous to the effects of monensin, expression of the 2B protein also results in the inhibition of complex glycosylation (as demonstrated by the endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H sensitivity of glycoproteins in 2B-expressing cells) and inhibition of protein secretion (3Doedens J.R. Kirkegaard K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 894-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). We propose that the disruption of the ionic content of the Golgi complex by 2B is responsible for this effect. How the disturbance of the Golgi milieu leads to an increase in plasma membrane permeability remains to be established. Possibly, the 2B-induced defect in transport of membrane proteins or lipids beyond the Golgi complex results in destabilization and permeabilization of the plasma membrane. However, it cannot be excluded that the effect on the plasma membrane is caused by the disturbance of another Golgi function(s).Having identified the Golgi complex as the main target organelle of the 2B protein, the question of what determines the Golgi localization of the 2B protein arises. In this study, the amphipathic α-helix was identified as a Golgi targeting signal that could confer partial Golgi localization to the heterologous EGFP protein in the absence of other domains of the 2B protein. However, the presence of both the amphipathic α-helix and the second hydrophobic domain was found to be required for efficient Golgi targeting. The Golgi localization of the 2B protein might depend on the length of the transmembrane domain(s), as suggested by the “bilayer-thickness model” (35Munro S. Trends. Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 11-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 36Bretscher M.S. Munro S. Science. 1993; 261: 1280-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 37Masibay A.S.

HR1 and HR2 are predicted to consist of 20 and 18 aa respectively, which is similar to the transmembrane domain of some Golgi resident proteins but shorter than the transmembrane domain of plasma membrane proteins (35Munro S. Trends. Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 11-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar,36Bretscher M.S. Munro S. Science. 1993; 261: 1280-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 41Watson R.T. Pessin J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C215-C223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, the “kin-recognition” model suggests that Golgi residents form large, oligomeric complexes that become too large to be transported as they reach the correct Golgi compartment (42Nilsson T. Slusarewicz P. Hoe M.H. Warren G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 43Nilsson T. Rabouille C. Hui N. Watson R. Warren G. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1975-1989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is unlikely that homo-multimerization reactions of the 2B protein (21De Jong A.S. Schrama I.W.J. Willems P.H.G.M. Galama J.M.D. Melchers W.J.G. van Kuppeveld F.J.M. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 783-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 28Cuconati A. Xiang W. Lahser F. Pfister T. Wimmer E. J.

Virol. 2002; 76: 9446-9456Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) are involved in determining its Golgi localization as 2B deletion mutants that lacked either HR1 or HR2 were not transported beyond the Golgi complex, although they were unable to form homo-multimers (28Cuconati A. Xiang W. Lahser F. Pfister T. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1297-1307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another possible explanation is that the 2B protein is not transported further along the secretory pathway because of the lack of specific signals, as was suggested for some trans-Golgi network markers (35Munro S. Trends. Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 11-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The possibility that trafficking of the 2B protein out of the Golgi complex is blocked as a consequence of the inhibition of protein secretion that is induced by the 2B protein itself (3Doedens J.R. Kirkegaard K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 894-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 6van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Melchers W.J.G. Kirkegaard K. Doedens J.R. Virology. 1997; 227: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) is unlikely as 2B deletion mutants lacking either HR1 or HR2 are not transported beyond the Golgi complex, although their function was severely impaired.How do our findings relate to the situation in virus-infected cells, where the 2B protein is present at the virus-induced membrane vesicles that build the viral RNA replication complex? Initially, these membrane vesicles are derived from the ER (9Rust R.C. Landmann L. Gosert R. Tang B.L. Hong W. Hauri H.P. Egger D. Bienz K. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 9808-9818Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Later in infection, however, the Golgi complex has disappeared (12Cho M.W. Teterina N. Egger D. Bienz K. Ehrenfeld E. Virology. 1994; 202: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 31Sandoval I.V. Carrasco L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4679-4693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Bolten R. Egger D. Gosert R. Schaub G. Landmann L. Bienz K. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8578-8585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Golgi membranes contribute to the vesicle population (7Schlegel A. Giddings T.H. Ladinsky M.S. Kirkegaard K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6576-6588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Bolten R. Egger D. Gosert R. Schaub G. Landmann L. Bienz K. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8578-8585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the Golgi complex is gradually used up to produce the membrane vesicles that build the viral replication complex. Therefore, our findings that identified Golgi membranes as the main target of the 2B protein are in agreement with the localization of the 2B and 2BC proteins at the ER- and Golgi-derived membrane vesicles in infected cells.The exact function of the 2B protein in the early steps in viral RNA replication remains to be established. The viability of viruses that carry mutations in the 2B protein closely correlates with the ability of the 2B protein to increase membrane permeability and inhibit protein secretion (1van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Hoenderop J.G.J. Smeets R.L.L. Willems P.H.G.M. Dijkman H.B.P.M. Galama J.M.D. Melchers W.J.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3519-3532Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 6van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Melchers W.J.G. Kirkegaard K. Doedens J.R. Virology. 1997; 227: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), suggesting that the destabilization and/or permeabilization of secretory pathway membranes by the 2B protein is somehow required for the accumulation of membrane vesicles or the formation of the membranous replication complex. Additional studies are needed to gain better insight into the membrane-active functions of the 2B and 2BC proteins and how these functions might aid in the processes that are required to facilitate the formation of membrane-associated replication complexes. Enteroviruses (e.g. poliovirus, coxsackievirus, ECHOvirus) belong to the family of picornaviridea, a group of nonenveloped, cytolytic viruses that have a positive stranded RNA genome of 7.5 kb. The enterovirus genome contains one large open reading frame that is translated into a single, 220-kDa polyprotein. Processing of the polyprotein by virus-encoded proteases yields the structural P1 region proteins that encapsidate the viral RNA and the non-structural P2 and P3 region proteins that are involved in replication of the viral RNA. Processing of the P2 and P3 regions yields the 2Apro, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3Cpro, and 3Dpol proteins and the more stable cleavage intermediates 2BC, 3AB, and 3CDpro, which have functions distinct from their cleavage products. Although multiple functions have been attributed to the mature viral proteins and the cleavage intermediates, the exact function of most of the viral proteins in the replication cycle is still largely unknown.

https://openalex.org/W2090577423,"Aerobic organisms possess efficient systems for the transport of copper. This involves transporters that mediate the passage of copper across biological membranes to reach essential intracellular copper-requiring enzymes. In this report, we identify a new copper transporter in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, encoded by the ctr6+ gene. The transcription ofctr6+ is induced under copper-limiting conditions. This regulation is mediated by the cis-acting promoter element CuSE (copper-signaling element) through the copper-sensing transcription factor Cuf1. An S. pombestrain bearing a disrupted ctr6Δ allele displays a strong reduction of copper,zinc superoxide dismutase activity. When thectr6+ gene is overexpressed from the thiamine-inducible nmt1+ promoter, the cells are unable to grow on medium containing exogenous copper. Surprisingly, this copper-sensitive growth phenotype is not due to an increase of copper uptake at the cell surface. Instead, copper delivery across the plasma membrane is reduced. Consistently, this results in repressing ctr4+ gene expression. By using a functional ctr6+ epitope-tagged allele expressed under the control of its own promoter, we localize the Ctr6 protein on the membrane of vacuoles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Ctr6 is an integral membrane protein that can trimerize. Moreover, we show that Ctr6 harbors a putative copper-binding Met-X-His-Cys-X-Met-X-Met motif in the amino terminus, which is essential for its function. Our findings suggest that under conditions in which copper is scarce, Ctr6 is required as a means to mobilize stored copper from the vacuole to the cytosol.

Acquisition of copper is crucial for aerobic life, because this element is an essential component of enzymes of primary metabolism (1Puig S. Thiele D.J. Curr. Opin. Chem.

Ctr1 is characterized by the presence of eight copies of the consensus sequence Met-X 2-Met-X-Met in its amino-terminal extracellular domain (16Puig S. Lee J. Lau M. Thiele D.J. J. Biol.

Although the eight Met-X 2-Met-X-Met motifs found in Ctr1 play an important role in copper uptake when cells are grown under copper starvation conditions, the last methionine (amino acid residue 127) of the Met-X 2-Met-X-Met motif 8 is essential for Ctr1 function (16Puig S. Lee J. Lau M. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26021-26030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Likewise, a Met-X 3-Met motif (residues 256–260) within the second transmembrane domain of Ctr1 was also identified as essential for copper transport (16Puig S. Lee J. Lau M. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26021-26030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that the S. cerevisiae Ctr3 protein exhibits a limited overall sequence homology to Ctr1, it has been demonstrated that Ctr3 bears a similar Met-X 3-Met motif (residues 185–189) within its second transmembrane domain (16Puig S. Lee J. Lau M. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26021-26030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). This enables Ctr3 to transport copper across the plasma membrane in conjunction with other critical residues such as Cys-16 within the amino-terminal portion, Cys-48 and Cys-51 within the first transmembrane domain, and Cys-199 found into the third transmembrane domain of the protein (16Puig S.

In fact, copper ions are transiently associated with small copper-binding proteins, denoted copper chaperones, that possess the ability to distribute copper to specific intracellular destinations (22Huffman D.L.

Consistent with their function in discrete pathways of intracellular copper distribution, mutations in any one of the copper chaperone genes gives rise only to specific defects in its respective pathway (22Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 677-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). In addition to the high affinity copper transporter and copper chaperones, a gene denoted CTR2 (37Kampfenkel K. Kushnir S. Babiychuk E. Inze D. Van Montagu M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28479-28486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) has been characterized that encodes a putative copper transporter located predominantly in the vacuolar membrane (38Portnoy M.E. Schmidt P.J. Rogers R.S. Culotta V.C. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 265: 873-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Although Ctr2 may mobilize intracellular copper stores, its precise mechanism of action has not been ascertained.The early molecular mechanisms of copper acquisition inSchizosaccharomyces pombe differ from those of S. cerevisiae. Two proteins, Ctr4 and Ctr5, form a two-component copper transporting complex at the cell surface (39Zhou H. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20529-20535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 40Labbé S. Peña M.M.O. Fernandes A.R. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36252-36260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This association between Ctr4 and Ctr5 appears to be critical for protein maturation and secretion of the heteroprotein complex to the plasma membrane (39Zhou H. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20529-20535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Within this complex, the exact function of each protein is currently unclear. Ctr4 is a 289-amino acid protein with five repeats of the consensus sequence Met-X 2-Met-X-Met in its amino terminus, which is predicted by topological analysis to reside extracellularly (40Labbé S. Peña M.M.O. Fernandes A.R. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36252-36260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal residues 111–248 of theS. pombe Ctr4 exhibit strong homology to the S. cerevisiae Ctr3 copper transporter, especially with respect to several residues within the three predicted transmembrane domains (6Labbé S. Thiele D.J. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 500-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar,40Labbé S. Peña M.M.O. Fernandes A.R. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36252-36260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Ctr5 is a 173-amino acid protein that is structurally related to Ctr4. An elegant study has demonstrated that Ctr5 is an integral membrane protein, which is required for properly localizing Ctr4 to the plasma membrane in S. pombe cells (39Zhou H. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20529-20535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Once copper ions are transported by the Ctr4-Ctr5 complex into the cells, they are presumably taken by putative copper chaperones, which are yet uncharacterized at the molecular level (41Labbé S. Beaudoin J. Bellemare D.R. Pelletier B. Massaro E.J. Handbook of Copper Pharmacology and Toxicology. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2002: 571-587Google Scholar). A hallmark of thectr4+ and ctr5+ genes is the fact that they are transcriptionally regulated according to copper need (40Labbé S. Peña M.M.O. Fernandes A.R. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36252-36260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 42Beaudoin J. Labbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15472-15480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The expression of ctr4+ andctr5+ is activated under copper starvation conditions, whereas repression of these genes occurs under copper-replete conditions. This regulation is mediated by thecis-acting promoter element, denoted CuSE (Cu-signaling element) with the consensus sequence 5′-D(T/A)DDHGCTGD-3′ (D = A, G, or T; H = A, C, or T) (42Beaudoin J. Labbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15472-15480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The transcription factor responsible for regulating the copper-dependent expression of genes encoding components involved in copper transport through the CuSEs is Cuf1 (40Labbé S. Peña M.M.O. Fernandes A.R. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36252-36260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 42Beaudoin J. Labbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15472-15480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).In this study, we identify a novel gene, termedctr6+, which is regulated at the transcriptional level in a copper- and Cuf1-dependent manner. A deletion of the ctr6+ gene (ctr6Δ) results in a significant reduction of copper,zinc-SOD1 activity. Cells overexpressing ctr6+ are unable to grow on medium containing exogenous copper. Surprisingly, this copper toxicity phenotype resulting from ctr6+ overexpression is not due to an increase of copper uptake. Instead, the cell surface copper transport activity is reduced, and consistently the steady-state levels of the ctr4+ mRNA are diminished. By using a ctr6+-HA4epitope-tagged allele, which retains wild type function, we have localized Ctr6-HA4 to the vacuolar membrane when cells are grown under conditions of low copper availability. Interestingly, we show that the amino terminus of Ctr6 harbors a Met-X-His-Cys-X-Met-X-Met sequence, which is essential for its intracellular copper transport activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Ctr6 is an integral membrane protein, which can assemble into a homotrimer complex. Taken together these results suggest that under copper scarcity, Ctr6 may serve to mobilize intravacuolar stores of copper in fission yeast.DISCUSSIONBecause of their property to promptly gain and lose electrons, copper ions are redox-active co-factors that serve as catalytic centers of numerous proteins involved in a variety of essential enzymatic processes (2Peña M.M.O. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 1251-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 68Askwith C. Kaplan J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 135-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Despite this crucial role, copper ions, when present in excess, can have detrimental effects due to their proclivity to engage in redox reactions or by competing with other metal ions for enzyme-active sites (4Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (4513) Google Scholar, 69Predki P.F. Sarkar B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5842-5846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, distinct pathways have evolved for the signaling, transport, trafficking, and sequestration of copper ions within cells to keep the delicate balance between essential and toxic levels (70Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. Science. 1997; 278: 817-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar).In this study, we identified a novel S. pombecopper-responsive gene, termed ctr6+, which encodes a vacuolar membrane transporter. Like the ctr4+ andctr5+ genes encoding the high affinity copper heteromeric transport complex at the cell surface in S. pombe (39Zhou H. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20529-20535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar),ctr6+ is activated at the transcriptional level in response to copper limitation by the Cuf1 nutritional copper-sensing transcription factor through the CuSE recognition sequence. Based on this observation that ctr6+ is transcriptionally regulated by copper in the same direction as the genes encoding components of the high affinity copper uptake machinery suggests a function for Ctr6 in copper utilization as opposed to copper detoxification. Given the fact that genetic studies have implicated the vacuole as playing a role for copper storage (38Portnoy M.E. Schmidt P.J. Rogers R.S. Culotta V.C. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 265: 873-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 71Szczypka M.S. Zhu Z. Silar P. Thiele D.J. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1423-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 72Eide D.J. Bridgham J.T. Zhao Z. Mattoon J.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and assuming that vacuolar copper is present in a usable form, we envision Ctr6 as an intracellular transporter to mobilize stores of copper from the organelle, thereby representing a specialized pathway by which copper could be distributed within cells (Fig.10). The proposed model is supported by the fact that a deletion of the ctr6+ gene (ctr6Δ) results in a significant reduction of copper,zinc-SOD1 activity, suggesting a role for S. pombeCtr6 in delivering copper to cytosolic copper-dependent enzyme(s) under conditions of copper scarcity. Furthermore, when Ctr6 was overexpressed from the thiamine-induciblenmt1+ promoter, the cells exhibited a copper-sensitive growth phenotype, which was not attributable to an increase of copper uptake. Consistently, in response to the action of Ctr6, there was loss of Cuf1-dependent activation of the cell surface copper transporter ctr4+ gene expression, which represents an additional argument indicating the increased of copper cellular levels within the cell.Because some membrane proteins that function in the secretory pathway (e.g. endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi apparatus) or at the plasma membrane may be mis-localized to the vacuole when overexpressed (73Urbanowski J.L. Piper R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38061-38070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), for subcellular localization of Ctr6, we used a functional epitope-tagged ctr6+ allele that was expressed under the control of its own promoter. This latter system ensured low levels of ctr6+ gene expression. Moreover, localization of Ctr6 to the vacuolar membrane was also observed using the disruption strain (ctr6Δ) in which actr6+-HA4 allele was re-integrated.2 To examine further the localization of Ctr6, we compared the labeling pattern of Ctr6-HA4 to the GST-Ptc4 fusion protein known to function in the vacuolar membrane (62Gaits F. Russell P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2647-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that Ctr6 localizes on the membrane of vacuoles in a manner identical to that observed for GST-Ptc4. Interestingly, similar subcellular localization has been reported recently (38Portnoy M.E. Schmidt P.J. Rogers R.S. Culotta V.C. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 265: 873-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) for the S. cerevisiae Ctr2 protein. Analogous to the situation for Ctr2, Ctr6 was visualized surrounding the vacuole with points of concentration of the protein around the organelle. This observation further supports a possible common role for these two proteins in the mobilization and transmission of intracellular pools of copper to metalloenzymes.Complementary to immunofluorescence localization, subcellular fractionation experiments demonstrate that Ctr6 is an integral membrane protein that is undetectable in soluble fractions, unless cell extracts were supplemented with Triton X-100, a detergent that solubilizes membrane structures (19Peña M.M.O. Puig S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33244-33251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). As demonstrated for the S. cerevisiae Ctr3 (19Peña M.M.O. Puig S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33244-33251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and human Ctr1 (74Lee J. Peña M.M.O. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4380-4387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), EGS cross-linking experiments revealed that Ctr6 can assemble as a trimer. Importantly, the homo-multimeric state of Ctr6 may be required to form a functional translocation path, which contains, in general, 6 ± 3 and up to 12 ± 2 transmembrane domains within transport proteins (67Veenhoff L.M. Heuberger E.H. Poolman B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 242-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Nine transmembrane domains from three Ctr6 molecules could be sufficient to form a pore by which copper can be translocated from the vacuole into the cytoplasm. The oligomeric state may also play a role in other functions of Ctr6, including its stabilization into the membrane structure, or interaction with the cytosolic domain of delivering copper proteins.Based on computer algorithm analysis, the amino-terminal 33 amino acids of Ctr6 are predicted to be inside the vacuole. Within this region of Ctr6 lies a putative copper coordination motif, Met-X-His-Cys-X-Met-X-Met (residues 9–16), that may function in copper capture within the vacuole. This is supported by the observation that mutations in which the methionine (Met-9) and histidine (His-11) or cysteine (Cys-12) and methionines (Met-14 and Met-16), or all five of these residues, were substituted to alanine altered copper transport activity of Ctr6. The methionine and histidine residues at positions 9 and 11, respectively, when mutated (mutant M1), gave rise to a stronger alteration with respect to Ctr6 activity compared with the mutant M2 in which the cysteine and methionine residues at position 12, 14, and 16 were mutated. However, whether one residue contributes more than another one in copper transport must await a fine mapping dissection of each amino acid that could play a role in the handling of copper. Similarly to the situation for the S. cerevisiae Ctr1 and Ctr3, and human Ctr1 (16Puig S. Lee J. Lau M. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26021-26030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), Ctr6 contains in its second transmembrane domain a conserved Met-X 3-Met motif (residues 111–115). Although we have not ascertained its function, this Met-X 3-Met motif may play a critical function in copper translocation across the vacuolar membrane.In the presence of excess iron or copper ions, the vacuole has been proposed to play an important role to detoxify the cell, preventing their accumulation in the cytosol to toxic levels. Once inside the vacuole, perhaps, these metal ions could be bound under a bio-unavailable form as Fe3+/Cu2+ to polyphosphates or other molecules. Conversely, when grown under copper starvation conditions, Ctr6 would mobilize stored copper from the vacuole to replenish the cytosol according to copper need. The similarity in the potency of silver in fostering the copper-sensitive growth phenotype because of the expression ofctr6+ and the electronic similarity of Ag+ to Cu+, but not Cu2+, suggest that the intracellular copper transporter Ctr6 may pump Cu+rather than Cu2+. This would suggest a role for a vacuolar membrane metalloreductase. So far, analysis of genomic DNA sequences from the S. pombe Genome project has revealed two open reading frames (SPBC1683.09C, denoted frp1+, andSPBC947.05C) related to Cu2+/Fe3+ion reductases found in S. cerevisiae. Although thefrp1+-encoded reductase can reduce Fe3+ to Fe2+ at the cell surface of fission yeast, its role in the metabolism of other metal ions (e.g. copper) is unknown. Regarding the second ORF, SPBC947.05C, its potential role in Fe3+/Cu2+ reductase activity is still uncharacterized. Finally, given the extended amino acid sequence homology between Ctr6 and all Ctr family members, especially within the regions that encompass the transmembrane domains, it will be interesting to determine what motif of the intracellular copper transporter Ctr6 is required for sorting the molecule to the vacuolar membrane, whereas the other members of the family, except for theS. cerevisiae Ctr2, are sorted to the plasma membrane. Acquisition of copper is crucial for aerobic life, because this element is an essential component of enzymes of primary metabolism (1Puig S. Thiele D.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar,2Peña M.M.O. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 1251-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Despite this vital role, too much copper in the cell can be detrimental, because in the presence of oxygen, copper can catalyze the production of cell-damaging hydroxyl radicals (3Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 4Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (4513) Google Scholar). To balance the need for copper and its potentially harmful effects, living organisms have developed various specialized pathways of copper transport and distribution (5O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J.

https://openalex.org/W1997349805,"Rho family GTPases are central regulators of neuronal morphology. Recently, Rnd proteins, Rnd1, Rnd2, and Rnd3/RhoE, have been identified as new members of Rho family GTPases. Of these, Rnd2 is specifically expressed in neurons in brain; however, the signaling pathways of Rnd2 are not known. Here we have performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using Rnd2 as a bait and identified a novel Rnd2-effector protein, expressed predominantly in brain. We named it Rapostlin (apostle of Rnd2). Rapostlin has two functional domains, Fer-CIP4 homology (FCH) domain at the amino terminus and SH3 (Src homology 3) domain at the carboxyl terminus. In in vitro binding assays, Rapostlin specifically binds to Rnd2 among the Rho family GTPases in a GTP-dependent manner, and the Rnd2-binding domain of Rapostlin is localized between FCH and SH3 domains. Rapostlin directly binds to microtubules, and the amino-terminal region containing the FCH domain of Rapostlin is essential for this interaction. In PC12 cells, Rapostlin induces neurite branching in response to Rnd2, and at least the amino-terminal region of Rapostlin is necessary for this activity. Therefore, Rapostlin is the first effector of Rnd2, regulating neurite branch formation. Rho family GTPases are central regulators of neuronal morphology.

Therefore, Rapostlin is the first effector of Rnd2, regulating neurite branch formation. The organization of the nervous system is a complex and orchestrated process. Neurons migrate to their characteristic locations, extend axons and dendrites toward proper target regions, and form synaptic connections with appropriate partners. These dynamic morphological changes of neurons are largely decided by the cytoskeletal organization. Rho family GTPases, consisting of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, have been implicated in the regulation of the cytoskeleton and subsequent morphological changes in various cells, such as formations of actin stress fibers, lamellipodia, and filopodia, respectively in fibroblasts (1Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Google Scholar). These actions of Rho family GTPases are mediated by a variety of downstream effectors (2Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Google Scholar). In neuronal cells, Rho family GTPases have been shown to be involved in the regulation of neuronal cell morphology including neuritogenesis. Rho activation induces the inhibition of neuritogenesis, the collapse of the growth cone, and the retraction of neurites (3Jalink K. Van Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Google Scholar, 4Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1201-1211Google Scholar, 5Yamaguchi Y. Katoh H. Yasui H. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18977-18983Google Scholar). These morphological actions of Rho have been shown to be mediated by Rho-kinase, a downstream effector of Rho (6Hirose M. Ishizaki T. Watanabe N. Uehata M. Kranenburg O. Moolenaar W.H. Matsumura F. Maekawa M. Bito H. Narumiya S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1625-1636Google Scholar, 7Katoh H. Aoki J. Ichikawa A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2489-2492Google Scholar). On the other hand, Rac and Cdc42 are involved in the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia of the growth cone and in the outgrowth of neurites (4Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1201-1211Google Scholar). Effectors of Rac and Cdc42, PAK1 and neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP), have been shown to play roles in these actions (8Banzai Y. Miki H. Yamaguchi H. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11987-11992Google Scholar, 9Daniels R.H. Hall P.S. Bokoch G.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 754-764Google Scholar). The less studied members of Rho family GTPases, such as RhoG and TC10, are also involved in the regulation of neuritogenesis (10Katoh H. Yasui H. Yamaguchi Y. Aoki J. Fujita H. Mori K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7378-7387Google Scholar, 11Tanabe K. Tachibana T. Yamashita T. Che Y.H. Yoneda Y. Ochi T. Tohyama M. Yoshikawa H. Kiyama H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4138-4144Google Scholar), suggesting that a variety of Rho family GTPases participate in the regulation of neuronal morphology. Recently, a new branch of Rho family GTPases, the Rnd subfamily, consisting of Rnd1, Rnd2, and Rnd3, has been identified (12Nobes C.D. Lauritzen I. Mattei M.G. Paris S. Hall A. Chardin P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 187-197Google Scholar). Rnd1 is mainly expressed in brain and liver, whereas Rnd3 is expressed ubiquitously (12Nobes C.D. Lauritzen I. Mattei M.G. Paris S. Hall A. Chardin P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 187-197Google Scholar, 13Foster R. Hu K.Q. Lu Y. Nolan K.M. Thissen J. Settleman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2689-2699Google Scholar). Unlike other Rho family GTPases, Rnd1 and Rnd3 possess very low intrinsic GTPase activity and constitutively bind to GTP (12Nobes C.D. Lauritzen I. Mattei M.G. Paris S. Hall A. Chardin P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 187-197Google Scholar, 13Foster R. Hu K.Q. Lu Y. Nolan K.M. Thissen J. Settleman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2689-2699Google Scholar, 14Guasch R.M. Scambler P. Jones G.E. Ridley A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4761-4771Google Scholar). Expression of Rnd1 or Rnd3 in fibroblasts results in loss of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, indicating the antagonistic effect on the Rho-regulated signaling pathway (12Nobes C.D. Lauritzen I. Mattei M.G. Paris S. Hall A. Chardin P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 187-197Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that Rnd1 induced neurite process formation, probably due to the inhibition of the Rho-regulated signaling pathway (15Aoki J. Katoh H. Mori K. Negishi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 604-608Google Scholar), and then we have identified a novel Rnd GTPase-interacting protein, Socius, which is involved in the Rnd1-induced disassembly of actin stress fibers (16Katoh H. Harada A. Mori K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2952-2964Google Scholar). In contrast to Rnd1 and Rnd3, little is known about Rnd2, although Rnd2 is expressed specifically in neurons in brain (17Nishi M. Takeshima H. Houtani T. Nakagawara K. Noda T. Sugimoto T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 74-81Google Scholar), suggesting that Rnd2 plays an important role in neuronal functions. We have recently demonstrated that Vps4-A, involved in the endosomal vesicle trafficking, is the first Rnd2-binding protein but is not an effector of Rnd2 since it binds to both active and negative forms of Rnd2 (18Tanaka H. Fujita H. Katoh H. Mori K. Negishi M. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 349-353Google Scholar). To dissect the molecular mechanism of neuronal functions of Rnd2, it is urgent to identify downstream effectors of Rnd2. Here we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify effectors of Rnd2 and found a novel effector protein of Rnd2, Rapostlin. Rapostlin specifically binds to Rnd2 among the Rho family GTPases in a GTP-dependent manner. Rapostlin directly binds to microtubules, and the amino-terminal region of Rapostlin is essential for this interaction. In PC12 cells, Rapostlin in concert with constitutively active Rnd2 induces neurite branching, and at least the amino-terminal region of Rapostlin is necessary for this activity. Therefore, this is the first protein to be identified as an effector of Rnd2. Wild-type and mutant forms of Rnd2, wild-type Rnd1, Rnd3, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 were obtained as described previously (10Katoh H. Yasui H. Yamaguchi Y. Aoki J. Fujita H. Mori K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7378-7387Google Scholar, 16Katoh H. Harada A. Mori K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2952-2964Google Scholar, 19Fujita H. Katoh H. Hasegawa H. Yasui H. Aoki J. Yamaguchi Y. Negishi M. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 617-622Google Scholar). For the yeast two-hybrid screen, the cDNA encoding Rnd2Ser-224, lacking a farnesylation site in the carboxyl-terminal CAAX motif by a substitution of cysteine to serine, was fused to the GAL4-DNA binding domain in the yeast expression vector pAS2-1 (Clontech). For purification of recombinant proteins, cDNA of Rnd2 was subcloned into pAcG2T (Pharmingen), whereas cDNAs of Rnd1, Rnd3, RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42, and various deletion mutants of Rapostlin, ΔN1 (amino acids 335–620), ΔN2 (amino acids 399–620), and ΔN3 (amino acids 552–620) were subcloned into pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Biosciences). For the mammalian two-hybrid screen, cDNAs encoding small GTPases, lacking a prenylation site in the carboxyl-terminal CAAX motif by a substitution of cysteine to serine, were fused to the GAL4-DNA binding domain in the mammalian expression vector pBIND (Promega), whereas Rapostlin was fused to VP16 in mammalian expression vector pACT (Promega). For expression in mammalian cells, cDNAs encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) 1The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; pAb, polyclonal antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FCH, Fer-CIP4 homology; SH3, Src homology 3; F-actin, filamentous actin. and mutant forms of Rnd2 were subcloned into mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), whereas cDNAs encoding the full-length Rapostlin (amino acids 2–620) and Rapostlin ΔN1 (amino acids 335–620) were subcloned into pcDNA3 encoding an initiating Met followed by the Myc epitope tag sequence at the amino terminus. A yeast two-hybrid screen was performed in yeast strain Y190 (Clontech) using a rat brain Matchmaker cDNA library fused to the GAL4 activation domain in the pACT2 (Clontech). Approximately 1.5 × 107 yeast colonies were screened for their ability to grow on selective medium lacking histidine, leucine, tryptophan, and uracil and containing 10 mm3-aminotriazole. Colonies that grew successfully were replated and screened by β-galactosidase assay. From positive yeast colonies, prey plasmids were isolated, and then yeast Y190 was cotransformed with these cDNAs and pAS2-1-Rnd2Ser-224 to confirm the interaction. Positive clones were sequenced using an ABI PRISM 310 DNA sequencer. Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (10Katoh H. Yasui H. Yamaguchi Y. Aoki J. Fujita H. Mori K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7378-7387Google Scholar). Total RNA from various rat tissues was isolated by using an Isogen RNA isolation kit (Nippon-gene, Tokyo, Japan), and 20 μg of total RNA was separated by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel and transferred onto a nylon membrane (Biodyne; Pall Biosupport Division). The membrane was hybridized at 65 °C for 18 h in a mixture containing 6× SSC (1× SSC is 150 mm NaCl and 15 mm sodium citrate), 0.5% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and a32P (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, NEG-513Z, 6000 Ci/mmol)-labeled probe encoding Rapostlin. The membrane was dried and autoradiographed with an x-ray film for 10 h. Antibody for Rnd2 was raised against bacterially expressed carboxyl-terminal Rnd2 insert region (GHRQLRRTDSRRGMQRSAQLSGRPDRGNEGEI), and the specific antibody was purified with a peptide (GRPDRGNEGEI)-conjugated affinity column. GlutathioneS-transferase (GST)-fused Rnd2 protein was prepared from Sf9 cells, whereas GST, GST fused with other small GTPases (Rnd1, Rnd3, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42), and various GST-fused deletion mutants of Rapostlin proteins (Rapostlin ΔN1, ΔN2, and ΔN3) were prepared from Escherichia coli, as described previously (7Katoh H. Aoki J. Ichikawa A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2489-2492Google Scholar, 20Self A.J. Hall A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 3-10Google Scholar). Recombinant GST or GST-fused small GTPases were loaded with 1 mm GDP or GTPγS in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 30 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped by addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 20 mm (21Manser E. Leung T. Lim L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 130-139Google Scholar). Dot-blot assays were performed as described previously (22Joberty G. Perlungher R.R. Macara I.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6585-6597Google Scholar). GST-Rapostlin ΔN1 was cleaved with thrombin. Rapostlin ΔN1 (5 μg), bovine serum albumin (10 μg), GST (7 μg), or GST-fused deletion mutants of Rapostlin (GST-Rapostlin ΔN1, ΔN2, or ΔN3) (7 μg) was spotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and allowed to dry for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were blocked in buffer A containing 5% low fat milk for 1 h at 4 °C. The membranes were then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in buffer A containing 16 μg of GST or GST-fused small GTPases preloaded with GDP or GTPγS. The membranes were washed with buffer A and then incubated with 3% low fat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing rabbit anti-GST polyclonal antibody (pAb) Ab-1 (Calbiochem; 1:200 dilution) or rabbit anti-Rnd2 pAb (1 μg/ml) to detect associated proteins. These antibodies were detected by using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (DAKO) and an ECL detection kit (AmershamBiosciences). COS-7, HeLa, and 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin under humidified air containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, 4 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin under humidified air containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were transfected with test cDNAs using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) for COS-7 and PC12 cells, SuperFect (Qiagen) for HeLa cells, or LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) for 293T cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. PC12 cells were differentiated with 50 ng/ml nerve growth factor (Promega) in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium after the transfection. COS-7 cells in 24-well plates at a density of 8 × 104 cells/well were transfected with 0.3 μg of pBIND vector (Promega) encoding both theRenilla luciferase for transfection efficiency and GAL4-fused small GTPases, 0.3 μg of pACT vector (Promega) encoding VP16-fused Rapostlin, and 0.3 μg of the reporter pG5luc vector (Promega) encoding the firefly luciferase, harboring five Gal4p binding sites in a minimal promoter region. Thirty-six h after the transfection, cells were lysed in 100 μl of 1× Passive lysis buffer (Promega). Firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase activities were measured with 5 μl of cell lysate by using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and a Luminoskan luminometer (Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland). Relative activity was defined as the ratio of firefly luciferase activity toRenilla luciferase activity. Co-sedimentation of Rapostlin and microtubules was performed as described previously (23Van Horck F.P.G. Ahmadian M.R. Haeusler L.C. Moolenaar W.H. Kranenburg O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4948-4956Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells in 100-mm dishes at a density of 2 × 106cells/dish were transiently transfected with Myc-tagged Rapostlin or Myc-tagged Rapostlin ΔN1 and lysed with general tubulin buffer (Cytoskeleton) containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate after the transfection. Lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C in a Micro Ultracentrifuge (Hitachi). Clear supernatant fractions were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with purified, taxol-stabilized microtubules, which were generated using the Microtubule/Tubulin Biochem kit (Cytoskeleton). Microtubules were then pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Supernatant and pellet fractions were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corporation). The membrane was blocked with 3% low fat milk in Tris-buffered saline and incubated with mouse anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody (mAb) B5-1-2 (Sigma; 1:1000 dilution) or mouse anti-Myc mAb 9E10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 2 μg/ml). These antibodies were detected by using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (DAKO) and an ECL detection kit. HeLa and PC12 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 5 × 103 onto glass coverslips (circular, 13 mm in diameter) and in 12-well plates at a density of 8 × 104 cells/well onto poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips (circular, 18 mm in diameter), respectively. Forty h after the transfection, cells on coverslips were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. After residual formaldehyde had been quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 10 min, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min and incubated with 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 30 min. For detection of Rnd2, cells were incubated with rabbit anti-Rnd2 pAb (1 μg/ml) in PBS for 1 h followed by incubation with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Chemicon; 1:250 dilution) in PBS for 1 h. For detection of Myc-tagged Rapostlin or Rapostlin ΔN1, cells were incubated with either mouse anti-Myc mAb 9E10 (2 μg/ml) or rabbit anti-Myc pAb (MBL; 1:500 dilution) in PBS for 1 h followed by incubation with a rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Chemicon; 1:250 dilution) and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:250 dilution), respectively, in PBS for 1 h. Microtubules were stained with mouse anti-α-tubulin mAb (Oncogene Science; 0.2 μg/ml) followed by incubation with a rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:250 dilution) in PBS for 1 h. Filamentous actin (F-actin) was visualized with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes; 0.4 units/ml) in PBS for 1 h. Cells on coverslips were mounted in 90% glycerol containing 0.1% p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride in PBS and photographed by an MRC-1024 laser scanning confocal imaging system (Bio-Rad) equipped with a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope and a Nikon Plan Apo 40 × 1.4 oil immersion objective lens. Branching activity was determined as described previously (24Szebenyi G. Callaway J.L. Dent E.W. Kalil K. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7930-7940Google Scholar). Briefly, PC12 cells bearing neurites longer than 5 μm were analyzed. Only processes longer than 5 μm from the neurites were considered as branches. The branching activity was defined as the ratio of the total number of the branches to the total length of the neurites from 20 cells, that is, the average number of branches per region. We adopted this criterion because neurites had generally more branches as neurites were longer. To gain insight into the downstream signaling of Rnd2, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen using human Rnd2 as a bait. Several positive clones were isolated from a rat brain cDNA library. Sequence analyses revealed that one of these encodes a protein almost identical to human formin-binding protein 17 (FBP17). In the yeast two-hybrid system, this clone specifically interacted with Rnd2 within the Rnd subfamily and with the well studied Rho GTPases, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. Then, we named it Rapostlin (apostle of Rnd2) (Fig.1 A). The context of the putative Met codon (ACCAUGA) (where underlining represents initiator codon) of Rapostlin is closer to the Kozak's consensus translation initiation sequence (ACCAUGG) (25Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Google Scholar). Rapostlin and hFBP17 proteins share 93% sequence identity and have well conserved regions, a Fer-CIP4 homology (FCH) domain at the amino terminus and an SH3 domain at the carboxyl terminus (Fig.1 B). Rapostlin shares 47% sequence identity with CIP4, which was isolated previously as a Cdc42 effector protein (26Aspenström P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 479-487Google Scholar). However, Rapostlin has a unique insert region, which is absent in CIP4. A coiled-coil region is found between FCH and the insert region of Rapostlin. To examine the tissue distribution of Rapostlin, we carried out a Northern hybridization analysis. Rapostlin mRNAs were predominantly expressed in brain, and weaker expression was detected in lung and spleen (Fig. 2).Figure 2Northern blot analysis of Rapostlin.Total RNAs were isolated from the respective rat tissues, and 20 μg of RNA was applied in each lane. Hybridization was carried out using32P-labeled cDNA encoding the full length of Rapostlin as a probe. The Rapostlin mRNAs (>7 and ∼4 kb) are indicated by arrows. The positions of 18 and 28 S rRNAs are indicated by arrowheads.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To confirm the interaction of Rapostlin and Rnd2, we carried out dot-blot assays. Rapostlin lacking the amino-terminal region (Rapostlin ΔN1) was spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and the membrane was overlaid with GDP- or GTPγS-preloaded GST-Rnd2. GTPγS-loaded GST-Rnd2 bound to Rapostlin ΔN1, but GDP-loaded GST-Rnd2 did not (Fig. 3 A). We next examined the interaction of Rapostlin ΔN1 with GST-fused Rnd and well known Rho family GTPases (GST-Rnd1, GST-Rnd2, GST-Rnd3, GST-RhoA, GST-Rac1, and GST-Cdc42) preloaded with GTPγS, and we found that GTPγS-loaded GST-Rnd2 specifically bound to Rapostlin ΔN1 (Fig. 3 B). These results indicate that Rnd2 specifically binds to Rapostlin among the Rho family GTPases in a GTP-dependent manner. To determine the Rnd2-binding domain of Rapostlin, we carried out a dot-blot assay by using various GST-fused deletion mutants of Rapostlin (GST-Rapostlin ΔN1, GST-Rapostlin ΔN2, and GST-Rapostlin ΔN3). Rnd2 strongly bound to Rapostlin ΔN1, weakly bound to Rapostlin ΔN2, but did not bind to Rapostlin ΔN3 (Fig.3 C). These results suggest that Rapostlin is a novel effector of Rnd2 and that the region of Rapostlin (amino acids 335–551) is important for the binding of Rnd2. Furthermore, to examine the in vivo interaction of Rapostlin with Rnd2 in mammalian cells, we carried out a mammalian two-hybrid assay. Our dot-blot assay (Fig. 3 A) indicates that Rapostlin binds to GTPγS-loaded but not to GDP-loaded Rnd2, suggesting that Rnd2 can become GTP-bound active or GDP-bound inactive form. We then constructed a constitutively active Rnd2 (Rnd2Val-16, equivalent to a constitutively active Val-12 mutation in Ras) and a negative Rnd2 (Rnd2Asn-21, equivalent to a dominant negative Asn-17 mutation in Ras). We transfected COS-7 cells with pBIND vector encoding GAL4-fused small GTPases, pACT vector encoding VP16-fused Rapostlin, and pG5luc vector encoding the firefly luciferase (Fig.4 A). Rapostlin strongly bound to Rnd2Val-16 and weakly bound to wild-type Rnd2, whereas it did not bind to Rnd2Asn-21, wild-type Rnd1, or wild-type Rnd3. To examine whether Rnd2 and Rapostlin are colocalized, we expressed Rnd2Val-16, Rapostlin, or both in HeLa cells. In the Rnd2Val-16-expressing cells, Rnd2Val-16 appeared to be localized to membranous structures including plasma membrane (Fig. 4 B,lane a). In addition, immunoblotting analyses of cytosolic and particulate fractions prepared from the Rnd2Val-16-transfected cells showed that Rnd2Val-16 was mainly localized in the particulate fraction (data not shown). In the Rapostlin-expressing cells, Rapostlin was localized in the cytoplasmic linear structures (Fig. 4 B,lane b). When HeLa cells were cotransfected with Rnd2Val-16 and Rapostlin, they were colocalized in a perinuclear condensed region accompanied with emanated linear structures (Fig. 4 B, lane c). These results suggest that Rapostlin binds to constitutively active Rnd2 in mammalian cells. We next examined the effects of Rnd2 and Rapostlin on cytoskeletons in HeLa cells. In the Rapostlin-expressing cells, Rapostlin was partially localized in microtubules (Fig. 4 C,lane a), whereas Rapostlin neither overlapped with F-actin nor induced a prominent change in the F-actin structure (Fig.4 C, lane b). When HeLa cells were cotransfected with Rnd2Val-16 and Rapostlin, they induced reorganization of F-actin to the perinuclear condensed region, where Rnd2Val-16 and Rapostlin were colocalized (Fig.4 C, lane c). These results suggest that the association of Rnd2Val-16 with Rapostlin induces the drastic reorganization of F-actin. The amino-terminal region of CIP4 has been reported to bind to microtubules (27Tian L. Nelson D.L. Stewart D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7854-7861Google Scholar). To examine whether the amino-terminal region of Rapostlin is essential for the interaction of Rapostlin to microtubules, we transiently expressed Rapostlin or Rapostlin ΔN1 in 293T cells and carried out microtubule binding assays (Fig. 5). Since microtubules can be pelleted by high speed centrifugation, binding of Rapostlin to microtubules can be tested in these co-sedimentation assays. In the presence of taxol-stabilized microtubules, Rapostlin bound to microtubules during high speed centrifugation (Fig.5 A), but Rapostlin ΔN1 did not (Fig. 5 B). These results suggest that Rapostlin binds to microtubules, either directly or indirectly, and that the amino-terminal region of Rapostlin is essential for the interaction. Rnd2 and Rapostlin are predominantly expressed in brain, and in situ hybridization analyses revealed that Rnd2 was expressed specifically in neurons in brain (17Nishi M. Takeshima H. Houtani T. Nakagawara K. Noda T. Sugimoto T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 74-81Google Scholar). To examine whether Rnd2 and Rapostlin were involved in the regulation of neuronal cell morphology, we transiently expressed Rnd2, Rapostlin, or both in the nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells. GFP-expressing control cells extended a few long unbranched neurites bearing microtubules (Fig. 6 A,lane a). Expression of Rnd2Val-16induced a few branches (Fig. 6 A, lane b), but Rnd2Asn-21-expressing cells had unbranched neurites (Fig.6 A, lane c). Expression of Rapostlin or Rapostlin ΔN1 induces no or few branches from neurites (Fig. 6 A,lanes d and e). On the other hand, coexpression of Rnd2Val-16 and Rapostlin dramatically induced many branches from neurites (Fig. 6 A, lane f). Fig.6 B shows the quantitative analyses of the effects of Rnd2 and Rapostlin on the branching activity. Rnd2Val-16 alone significantly displayed the branching activity. This may be mediated by endogenous Rapostlin since we detected the expression of Rapostlin mRNA in PC12 cells by reverse transcriptase-PCR (data not shown). Active Rnd2, Rnd2Val-16, with Rapostlin strongly stimulated the branching activity, but negative Rnd2, Rnd2Asn-21, failed to stimulate the activity in the presence of Rapostlin (Fig. 6,A (lane g) and B). Therefore, Rnd2Val-16 associates with Rapostlin and induces the branching activity. Furthermore, to analyze the function of the amino-terminal region of Rapostlin, we transiently expressed Rnd2Val-16 with Rapostlin ΔN1 (Fig. 6 A,lane h, and B). These cells did not induce neurite branching, suggesting that the amino-terminal region of Rapostlin was at least necessary for the neurite branching. Rnd2 is a new member of Rho family GTPases, which is specifically expressed in neurons in brain. To identify downstream effectors of Rnd2, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen with Rnd2 as a bait and isolated a novel effector of Rnd2, Rapostlin, which induces neurite branching in neuronal cells. Rapostlin has a highly homologous protein, human FBP17, which was identified previously as one of the formin-binding proteins (28Chan D.C. Bedford M.T. Leder P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1045-1054Google Scholar). Recently, FBP17 was reported to interact with sorting nexin 2 (29Fuchs U. Rehkamp G. Haas O.A. Slany R. König M. Bojesen S. Bohle R.M. Damm-Welk C. Ludwig W.D. Harbott J. Borkhardt A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8756-8761Google Scholar), suggesting that FBP17 and Rapostlin are involved in receptor trafficking. Rapostlin shows high similarity to CIP4, a Cdc42 effector protein (26Aspenström P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 479-487Google Scholar), and has similar domain structures to CIP4, an FCH domain at the amino terminus and SH3 domain at the carboxyl terminus. A previous study showed that the region of CIP4 responsible for binding to Cdc42 is localized to amino acids 383–417 (27Tian L. Nelson D.L. Stewart D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7854-7861Google Scholar). FBP17 has a domain (amino acids 475–537) with significant homology to the Rho binding domains of Rhotekin and Rhophilin, and this domain is also present in Rapostlin. In this study, we showed that Rapostlin does not interact with Cdc42 or RhoA and that the unique insert region is critical for the Rnd2 binding to Rapostlin. These results indicate that Rapostlin is a specific effector of Rnd2 but not of Cdc42 or RhoA. The SH3 domain of CIP4 interacts with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein, a regulator of the actin cytoskeleton, whereas the amino-terminal region including the FCH domain binds to microtubules, suggesting that CIP4 is a potential linker between the actin cytoskeleton and microtubules (27Tian L. Nelson D.L. Stewart D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7854-7861Google Scholar). Actually, CIP4 has been shown to be involved in microtubule-dependent formation of F-actin-rich podosomal adhesion in macrophages (30Linder S. Hüfner K. Wintergerst U. Aepfelbacher M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4165-4176Google Scholar). Rapostlin has two functional domains, FCH-containing amino-terminal region and SH3 domain, those of CIP4 being involved in the reorganization of both microtubules and actin filaments. In this study, we showed that Rapostlin binds to microtubules in the microtubule-binding assay and that Rapostlin induces reorganization of F-actin in response to Rnd2 in HeLa cells. Thus, Rapostlin may act as a regulatory linker between the actin cytoskeleton and microtubules. Rho family GTPases are central regulators of neuronal morphology, including neurite formation, elongation, retraction, and branching (31Luo L. Nature Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 173-180Google Scholar). The process of neurite branching is a dynamic combination of branch addition and branch elimination as well as branch extension and retraction. In the beginning of branch formation, F-actin-rich filopodia and lamellipodia are extended from the neurites. Cortical protrusions enlarge from the filopodial and lamellipodial area, and then branches emerge. While branches are formed, the protrusion sites are invested with microtubules, indicating that branch formation is closely accompanied by the reorganization of both the actin cytoskeleton and microtubules. It has been shown that dominant negative forms of Rac1 and Cdc42 lead to a reduction in the dendritic complexity of Xenopus retinal ganglion cells (32Ruchhoeft M.L. Ohnuma S. McNeill L. Holt C.E. Harris W.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8454-8463Google Scholar). In addition, constitutively active Rac1 leads to increased branch dynamics (33Li Z. Van Aelst L. Cline H.T. Nature Neurosci. 2000; 3: 217-225Google Scholar). In contrast to Rac1 and Cdc42, RhoA activation leads to a reduction in dendrite branching (34Nakayama A.Y. Harms M.B. Luo L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5329-5338Google Scholar). Therefore, Rac and Cdc42 exert a positive effect on dendritic branching and remodeling, whereas Rho is a negative regulator for branch formation. However, molecular mechanisms of branch formation regulated by these Rho family GTPases are not well understood. In this study, we revealed that Rapostlin induces neurite branching in response to Rnd2 in neuronal cells. The binding of active Rnd2 to Rapostlin triggers the branch formation because negative Rnd2, Rnd2Asn-21, fails to stimulate the Rapostlin-mediated branch formation. Therefore, Rapostlin is a downstream effector of Rnd2 for the branch formation. Moreover, we showed here that the amino-terminal region of Rapostlin is necessary for the neurite branching induced by Rapostlin in concert with Rnd2 in PC12 cells. In the microtubule-binding assay, this amino-terminal region of Rapostlin is essential for the binding of Rapostlin to microtubules, suggesting that the interaction of Rapostlin with microtubules is crucial for the neurite branching induced by Rnd2 and Rapostlin. Most of Rho family GTPases cycle between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound forms. Unlike GTPase-cycling Rho family GTPases, Rnd1 and Rnd3 have been shown to be constitutively active forms due to point substitutions at the residue equivalent of Ras Gly-12 to valine and serine, respectively, decreasing intrinsic GTPase activity (12Nobes C.D. Lauritzen I. Mattei M.G. Paris S. Hall A. Chardin P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 187-197Google Scholar, 13Foster R. Hu K.Q. Lu Y. Nolan K.M. Thissen J. Settleman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2689-2699Google Scholar, 14Guasch R.M. Scambler P. Jones G.E. Ridley A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4761-4771Google Scholar). In contrast, this residue of Rnd2 is replaced by alanine. Here we showed that Rapostlin binds to GTPγS-bound Rnd2, but not to GDP-bound Rnd2, in a dot-blot assay and that Rapostlin strongly binds to Rnd2Val-16 (equivalent to a constitutively active Val-12 mutation in Ras), whereas Rapostlin does not bind to Rnd2Asn-21 (equivalent to a dominant negative Asn-17 mutation in Ras). Furthermore, we showed that Rapostlin induces neurite branching in response to Rnd2Val-16 but not to Rnd2Asn-21 in PC12 cells. Therefore, Rnd2 has an ability to become either GTP-bound active or GDP-bound negative form, and the only active form of Rnd2 binds to Rapostlin, inducing neurite branching. Biochemical characterization of GTPase activity of Rnd2 is currently in progress in our laboratory. In conclusion, we have identified a novel downstream effector of Rnd2, Rapostlin, involved in the neurite branch formation. Rapostlin is the first to be identified as an effector of Rnd2. However, many questions have not yet been elucidated about Rnd2 signaling, for example, what molecules participate in the upstream signaling of Rnd2. Further studies focusing on the identification of Rnd2-interacting proteins will contribute to understanding of the Rnd2-signaling pathway and the regulation of neuronal morphology."

High level heterologous expression of human P-glycoprotein, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has facilitated biophysical studies in purified proteoliposome preparations. Membrane permeability of transported drugs and consequent lack of an experimentally defined drug position have made resolution of the transport mechanism difficult by classical techniques. To overcome these obstacles we devised a novel EPR spin-labeled verapamil for use as a transport substrate. Spin-labeled verapamil was an excellent transport substrate with apparent turnover number,K m and K i values of 5.8 s−1, 4 μm, and 210 μm,respectively, at pH 7.4 and 37 °C. The apparent affinities were ∼10-fold higher than for unlabeled verapamil. Spin-labeled verapamil stimulated ATPase activity ∼5-fold, was relatively hydrophilic, and had a very low flip-flop rate, making it an ideal transport substrate. The K m for MgATP activation of transport was 0.8 mm. By measuring the mobility of spin-labeled verapamil during transport experiments, we were able to resolve the location of the drug in proteoliposome suspensions. Steady state gradients of spin-labeled verapamil within the range ofK i/K m ratios were observed.

The resistance of cancer cells to a wide variety of anti-cancer drugs leads to failure of chemotherapy and remains a major medical problem. P-glycoprotein (Pgp) 1The abbreviations used are: Pgp, P-glycoprotein; AMPPNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate; K p, organic phase molar partition coefficient; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; PPI , peak to peak intensity; SL-verapamil, spin-labeled verapamil; TPP+, tetraphenylphosphonium; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; MTS-verapamil, verapamilethyl-methanethiosulfonate bromide. mediates such multidrug resistance through its ability to transport various hydrophobic compounds across the plasma membrane (1Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Google Scholar). This feature of Pgp is of great clinical interest. P-glycoprotein belongs to the ATP-binding cassette transporter family (2Hyde S.C. Emsley P. Hartshorn M.J. Mimmack M.M. Gileadi U. Pearce S.R. Gallagher M.P. Gill D.R. Hubbard R.E. Higgins C.F. Nature. 1990; 346: 362-365Google Scholar). This protein consists of two homologous domains; each domain has six transmembrane helices and an ATP-binding site. Photolabeling and genetic studies have indicated that drug-binding site(s) are located in the transmembrane region (reviewed in Ref. 3Ambudkar S.V. Dey S. Hrycyna C.A. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 361-398Google Scholar). Binding of drugs stimulates ATP hydrolysis at ATP-binding sites, which is coupled to drug transport (4Senior A.E. Al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Google Scholar). Transport substrates of Pgp are generally hydrophobic compounds that partition into the bilayer. Many of them are positively charged or uncharged. Studies utilizing fluorescent substrates have shown that Pgp removes drugs from the cytoplasmic leaflet of plasma membranes and exports them to the external aqueous medium (5Shapiro A.B. Corder A.B. Ling V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 115-121Google Scholar, 6Shapiro A.B. Ling V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 122-129Google Scholar, 7Shapiro A.B. Ling V. Eur. J.

This is known as the “hydrophobic vacuum cleaner model” (1Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism of drug transport and energy coupling, the location of drug must be determined without ambiguity. Due to high lipid partition coefficients, high diffusion rates, as well as nonspecific drug binding in conventional assays, it is difficult to investigate the molecular details of substrate binding and transport by Pgp. In consequence, the mechanism of drug transport coupled to ATP hydrolysis is still not resolved. Binding of an amphipathic molecule to liposomes changes its mobility and accessibility. EPR spectroscopy is a good tool to monitor quantitatively changes in the mobility and accessibility (9Flewelling R.F. Hubbell W.L. Biophys. J. 1986; 49: 531-540Google Scholar, 10Victor K.G. Cafiso D.S. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2241-2250Google Scholar). Here we report a new strategy to investigate the transport mechanism of P-glycoprotein using a new spin-labeled transport substrate. Yeast strain BJ5457/YEpMDR1HIS that expresses 10× His-tagged human P-glycoprotein (MDR1 gene product; see Ref. 11Figler R.A. Omote H. Nakamoto R.K. Al-Shawi M.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 34-46Google Scholar) was cultured at 30 °C in 36 liters of Synthetic Dextrose (SD) media supplemented with 10% (v/v) glycerol to improve Pgp expression. Additional 10× concentrated SD media were added at 1.0 and 2.2 OD 600 units. Cells were harvested at 3.0 OD 600 units and frozen by liquid nitrogen. Frozen cells were thawed in deionized water containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and precipitated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g. Cells (∼130 g) were resuspended in ice-cold homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 0.3 m sucrose, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 25 mm β−mercaptoethanol, 1 mm PMSF, 2 μm pepstatin, 1 μmleupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate). Cells were broken and homogenized on ice using silica-zirconia beads in a Bead-Beater (Biospec Products Inc.). Three 4-min cycles were employed, and fresh 1 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate was added at each cycle. Beads were washed by fresh homogenization buffer and combined with cell lysates. Crude microsomes were prepared, and P-glycoprotein was purified as described previously (11Figler R.A. Omote H. Nakamoto R.K. Al-Shawi M.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 34-46Google Scholar). P-glycoprotein containing proteoliposomes were made by dialysis as described previously (12Urbatsch I.L. Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7069-7076Google Scholar) utilizing 0.1% (w/v) “mixed lipid” composed of 60% (w/w) Escherichia coliether/acetone-precipitated lipid, 17.5% egg phosphatidylcholine, 10% bovine brain phosphatidylserine, and 12.5% cholesterol (lipids were from Avanti polar lipids). Reconstituted vesicles were suspended in EPR buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, and 50 mm KCl) plus 0.1 mm dithiothreitol and centrifuged again at 270,000 × g for 60 min. Pellets were resuspended in a small amount of the same buffer. Control liposomes, lacking Pgp, were prepared in parallel. An equivalent lipid/detergent mixture (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm imidazole HCl, 2 mm MgSO4, 50 mm Na2SO4, 2 mm ATP, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1.4% (w/v) octyl glucoside, 0.1% (w/v) mixed lipid, 2 mm β−mercaptoethanol, 1 mm PMSF) was passed through a washed nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen). Eluates were dialyzed and control liposomes collected by centrifugation. Lipid concentrations were measured by the method of Andree and Soedjak (13Andree H.A.M. Soedjak H.S. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 465-471Google Scholar). Other routine methods can be found in Figleret al. (11Figler R.A. Omote H. Nakamoto R.K. Al-Shawi M.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 34-46Google Scholar). Spin-labeled verapamil (SL-verapamil) was synthesized from verapamilethyl-methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTS-verapamil; Toronto Research Chemicals) and proxyl-maleimide (Aldrich). All procedures were carried out in the dark at room temperature. For chemical reduction, 800 μl of 6.25 mm MTS-verapamil in 50 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 8.5, and 70% (v/v) methanol was applied to an immobilized dithiothreitol gel column (0.8 g of Reductacryl, Calbiochem) pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. After 1 h, reduced MTS-verapamil was recovered by washing the column with 6 ml of the same buffer and was then coupled to 5 μmol of proxyl-maleimide during a 1-h incubation. Crude SL-verapamil was concentrated to ∼400 μl by an argon stream and then purified by high performance liquid chromatography using an XTerra RP column (4.6 × 150 mm, Waters) run with 60% (v/v) methanol and 4 mm Tricine/NaOH, pH 8.5, as the mobile phase. Elution of unreacted species and products were monitored at 278 nm. Methanol and water were evaporated from the SL-verapamil fraction by an argon stream. The resultant solution was mixed with an equal volume of dimethyl sulfoxide and stored under argon at −80 °C. A further high performance liquid chromatography run checked the purity of SL-verapamil, and the correct molecular mass of 753 Da was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Two different ATPase assays were employed. For conventional assay, activity was measured at 37 °C in an ATPase mixture containing 20 mm Tris-SO4, pH 7.4, 10 mm ATP, 15 mm MgSO4 (11Figler R.A. Omote H. Nakamoto R.K. Al-Shawi M.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 34-46Google Scholar). In the other assay, the reaction was started by addition of various concentrations of MgATP to 35 μl of EPR buffer containing 2 μm P-glycoprotein, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.1 mg/ml pyruvate kinase, and 0.5 mm MgSO4. Temperature was strictly controlled at 23 °C. Samples (5 μl) were withdrawn at appropriate times to 100 μl of ice-cold 8 mmEDTA (pH 8) to stop further reaction. Determination of liberated inorganic phosphate was as described previously (14Al-Shawi M.K. Ketchum C.J. Nakamoto R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2300-2306Google Scholar). Drug titrations of ATPase activities were fitted to an activity-partitioning model in which basal and drug stimulated activities are co-dependent. Thus Pgp partitions between two forms, an uncoupled form and a coupled form in the presence of activating drug. At maximal activation all Pgp exists in the coupled form. Both activities are inhibited by inhibitory concentrations of drug. The steady state velocity equation is given by Equation 1,ν=(B+(D·[drug]/(Km+[drug]))−(B·[drug]/(Km+[drug])))−(Eq. 1) {(B+(D·[drug]/(Km+[drug]))−(B·[drug]/(Km+[drug])))−((B+(D·[drug]/(Km+[drug]))−(B·[drug]/(Km+[drug])))·(1−([drug]/(Ki+[drug]))))}where ν is the ATPase activity; [drug] is the drug concentration; B is the basal ATPase activity; Dis the maximal ATPase activity associated with drug activation;K m is the Michaelis constant for drug activation, and K i is the inhibition constant for drug inhibition. Continuous wave EPR spectra were taken at 23 °C using a Bruker EMX X-band EPR spectrometer fitted with a loop gap resonator (Medical Systems). Samples were loaded in TPX capillaries (IGC Medical Advances Inc.). For measurement of partition coefficients, EPR spectra of SL-verapamil were recorded with various concentrations of lipid in the EPR buffer. The molar partition coefficient, K p, is a drug partition coefficient that has the units of m−1 with respect to lipid (organic phase) concentration in the total mixture. For applications involving liposomes and proteoliposomes, this constant is useful in calculating the amounts of free and partitioned drug for any concentration of known lipid because the volume ratio of organic to aqueous phases is subsumed in the concentration term.K p was calculated according to Victor and Cafiso (10Victor K.G. Cafiso D.S. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2241-2250Google Scholar) as shown in Equations 2 and 3,fraction of probe partitioned into lipid(Eq. 2) =(PPItotal−PPIfree)/PPItotalandfraction of probe partitioned into lipid(Eq. 3) =Kp[lipid]/(1+Kp[lipid])Here, PPI free andPPI total are peak to peak intensities of the high field signal (m I = −1 resonance) with lipid and without lipid, respectively. The fraction of probe partitioned into lipid at any particular experimental lipid concentration was calculated by Equation 2 (see Fig. 4, inset). Due to nonspecific binding of SL-verapamil to plastics in the absence of lipids, the peak to peak intensity decreased significantly without lipid. Extrapolation of lipid titration curves to zero lipid concentration was used to calculate the corrected PPI total.K p was obtained by fitting Equation 3 to the lipid-partitioned probe data as a function of lipid concentration (see Fig. 4). As the flip-flop rate of SL-verapamil was very slow (“Results”), the lipid concentration ([lipid]) refers to the external lipid leaflet concentration only. For transport assays, 10 mm MgATP or various given MgATP concentrations were added to 5 μl of reaction mixture containing 0.4–2 μm reconstituted Pgp, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.1 mg/ml pyruvate kinase, 0.5 mm MgSO4, and 10–300 μmSL-verapamil and mixed by tituration. Monitoring of high field EPR spectra was started immediately. Each scan (10 G sweep width) was recorded for analysis. A wire type thermocouple probe was used to measure temperature of the resonator. Apparent transport rate constants were obtained by exponential fitting of the data. Drug partitioning into olive oil (Fluka) was measured according to Zamoraet al. (15Zamora J.M. Pearce H.L. Beck W.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 33: 454-462Google Scholar). Drugs were solubilized in buffer containing 100 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.5, and added to an equal volume of olive oil and mixed vigorously for 30 min at 23 °C. Mixtures were separated by centrifugation. Concentrations were determined by EPR spectra or by optical absorbance of the aqueous phase in the case of unlabeled verapamil. Vesicles were diluted to 100 μg/ml with EPR buffer, and vesicle diameter was measured by dynamic light scattering on a DynaPro-MS800 (Protein Solutions). Vesicle hydrodynamic radii were calculated using Dynamics software (Protein Solutions). Concentrations of spin probe in each compartment were calculated utilizing measurements of amounts of free and lipid-partitioned SL-verapamil, concentrations of SL-verapamil transported, vesicle hydrodynamic radii, lipid concentrations, and partition coefficients (K p). From these measurements the additional parameters of lipid leaflet volumes, external and lumenal aqueous phase volumes, were calculated assuming an average weighted molecular mass of 883 Da for the mixed lipid preparations used and a bilayer thickness of 4 nm (16White S.H. Ladokhin A.S. Jayasinghe S. Hirstova K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32395-32398Google Scholar). Because the external aqueous volume of the medium was much larger than the aqueous lumen volume, the signal from free aqueous SL-verapamil was initially equated with the external aqueous concentration (a very good approximation; see “Results”). Employing the value determined above, together with the measured outer leaflet lipid concentration, the fraction of spin probe partitioned into the outer leaflet was calculated using Equation 3. The fraction partitioned was then converted into concentration units. Similarly, employing the amount of transported SL-verapamil, at any given time point, together with the calculated inner leaflet lipid concentration, the fractions and concentrations of lumenal free and inner leaflet-partitioned spin probe were calculated using Equation 3. The majority of the transported SL-verapamil was lipid-partitioned (see “Results”). Initially calculated concentrations were then slightly readjusted to account for the small luminal aqueous concentrations measured. Spin-labeled verapamil was synthesized by reduction of MTS-verapamil followed by modification with proxyl-maleimide (see “Materials and Methods”). The molecular size of SL-verapamil (753 Da) is substantially greater than that of verapamil (455 Da). Additionally SL-verapamil carries a permanent positive charge (Fig. 1). These features could have affected the ability of the P-glycoprotein to recognize SL-verapamil as a substrate. We measured activation of Pgp ATPase activity as a preliminary test of substrate recognition (12Urbatsch I.L. Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7069-7076Google Scholar, 17Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4197-4206Google Scholar). Fig.2 shows that SL-verapamil activated Pgp ATPase activity by almost 5-fold, similar to verapamil. ApparentK m and K i values were 4.3 and 206 μm, respectively. These values were significantly lower than those of verapamil (62 and 640 μm, respectively) indicating spin-labeled verapamil is a higher affinity substrate than verapamil.Figure 2Spin-labeled verapamil concentration dependence of P-glycoprotein ATPase activity. ATPase activity was measured at 37 °C in 40 mm Tris-SO4, pH 7.4, 10 mm ATP, 15 mm MgSO4 as a function of drug concentration. Activities were normalized to basal ATPase activity in the absence of added substrate.

Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Google Scholar), Pgp takes up substrates from the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane and transports them to the aqueous medium surrounding the cell. Thus partitioning of drugs into the lipid bilayer is a major determinant of the apparent K m of drug transport (18Romsicki Y. Sharom F.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6887-6896Google Scholar, 19Seelig A. Landwojtowicz E. Eur. J. Pharm. Sci. 2000; 12: 31-40Google Scholar). We measured the SL-verapamil partitioning into liposomes by monitoring mobility changes using EPR spectroscopy. The aqueous solution spectra of SL-verapamil (Fig. 3 A) and proxyl-maleimide (not shown) were similar with three sharp peaks (resonance lines) characteristic of high mobility at the nitroxide moiety. However, when SL-verapamil was mixed with liposomes (121 mm lipid), a low mobility signal (broadened peaks) appeared (Fig. 3 B), and the intensity of the high mobility signal (sharp peaks) was decreased. In contrast, the proxyl-maleimide signal did not change with the addition of liposomes (not shown). Similarly, in the case of spin-labeled amphipathic basic peptides, partitioning of the peptides into liposomes lowered the mobility (10Victor K.G. Cafiso D.S. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2241-2250Google Scholar). Thus, it is reasonable to assign the low and high mobility portions of the signals to liposome-partitioned and aqueous phase SL-verapamil, respectively. Because the high mobility signal at high field (m I = −1 resonance) is well separated from the low mobility signal (compare Fig. 3, A and B), the peak to peak intensity at high field (PPI) can be used to calculate the aqueous phase concentration of free spin probe. The molar partition coefficient of SL-verapamil into mixed lipids (K p= 15.7m−1) was determined by liposome titrations using a fixed concentration of 50 μm SL-verapamil (Fig.4; see “Materials and Methods”). The determined value of K p was unchanged when 25 μm SL-verapamil was used in liposome titrations (not shown). Thus under normal experimental conditions (∼10 mmlipid), it is expected that most of SL-verapamil will be located in the aqueous phase as was seen (Fig. 3 C). The partition coefficient (P o) of SL-verapamil into olive oil was found to be only 0.35 in contrast to a value of 42 for verapamil. Thus SL-verapamil appears to be 120-fold more hydrophilic than verapamil. We think that this hydrophilicity results primarily from the fixed positive charge of this compound. Verapamil has long been known to be a good transport substrate for P-glycoprotein (20Yusa K. Tsuruo T. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5002-5006Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions, the expected small low mobility signal of SL-verapamil bound directly to Pgp could not be resolved from the large low mobility signal of SL-verapamil partitioned into liposomes. However, in the presence of Pgp and MgATP, there was a time-dependent drop of the high mobility signal with a concomitant increase of the low mobility signal (compare Fig. 3, C and D). Such signal changes were not observed on addition of non-hydrolyzable MgAMPPNP (Fig.5) or MgATP plus orthovanadate (not shown). Furthermore, MgATP did not alter the EPR spectrum of SL-verapamil with liposomes in the absence of Pgp (not shown). The decrease of high mobility signal indicates a decrease of free spin probe in the aqueous phase. This decrease by MgATP corresponded to a decrease of ∼10 μm free SL-verapamil. This value was ∼5-fold larger than the Pgp concentration of 2 μm in Fig. 5 and up to 50-fold larger in other experiments (not shown). These results indicate that this new spin probe was transported by P-glycoprotein. Spin-labeled verapamil transport was confirmed directly by separation of vesicles from the suspending medium by centrifugation after MgATP addition (Fig. 6). Double integration of EPR spectra indicated 45% of spin probe was recovered from the vesicle fraction. The majority of SL-verapamil signal in the separated vesicles was of low mobility type, indicating that the lipid-partitioned form was the predominant species in vesicles (Fig. 6, spectra). In contrast, the supernatant after centrifugation had only the high mobility type signal, which represented 55% of total spin probe present (Fig. 6). The signals were additive, thus total spin probe was recovered in the two fractions. Furthermore, calculated amounts of SL-verapamil in the different compartments were similar when estimated from the results prior to and after separation by centrifugation. Overall the results indicate that SL-verapamil is transported into vesicles and is then partitioned into lipid, probably to the inner leaflet of proteoliposomes. Because the intravesicular aqueous space is so limited (Fig. 7), the effective lipid concentration inside proteoliposomes is very high. Thus, most of SL-verapamil inside of vesicles is expected to be lipid-partitioned after transport to the lumen. Based on the K p value determined (Fig. 4) and calculation of internal lipid concentrations, it is expected that 60–70% of SL-verapamil would be partitioned into the lipid phase.Figure 7Localization of spin-labeled verapamil.Schematic illustration of spin-labeled verapamil transport into vesicles. Calculated values shown were obtained from the data of Fig.6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Addition of vanadate or EDTA to inhibit Pgp activity did not induce release of accumulated SL-verapamil for up to 3 h (e.g.Fig. 5), whereas the addition of the detergent dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside allowed SL-verapamil re-equilibration with the medium (not shown). Thus the vesicles into which SL-verapamil accumulated were tightly sealed. The rate of partitioning of SL-verapamil into lipid was very fast and could not be resolved experimentally. Because the association of SL-verapamil with lipids is a partitioning phenomenon, it is expected that the release rate of SL-verapamil from lipids would also be very fast. This was confirmed by experiments in which lipid vesicles were preincubated with high concentrations of SL-verapamil, which rapidly partitioned into the outer leaflet. Upon dilution of these vesicles there was a rapid re-equilibration of SL-verapamil with the aqueous phase (results not shown). Thus the results of Fig. 5 suggest that the flip-flop rate of transported SL-verapamil between the two leaflets of the membrane was negligible over the assay time course. Similarly, the rate of re-equilibration of transported SL-verapamil from the centrifugation-separated and resuspended vesicles (Fig. 6) was very slow, confirming that the flip-flop rate was slow. Apparent K m and K i values for SL-verapamil transport of 13.5 and 216 μm, respectively, were obtained from initial rates of transport as a function of added SL-verapamil concentration (not shown). These values were similar to the analogous constants determined in ATPase assays (Fig. 2). To calculate the concentration of SL-verapamil in each compartment of the proteoliposome suspension, the average vesicular radius was determined by dynamic light scattering. The averaged vesicle hydrodynamic radius was 42 nm indicating that typical unilamellar vesicles were present. Concentrations of SL-verapamil in both aqueous phases and in the outer and inner leaflets were calculated employing the experimental results of amounts of free and lipid-partitioned SL-verapamil, and concentrations moved together with knowledge of vesicle radii, partition coefficients, and lipid concentrations. During a transport experiment, the decreased amount of free spin probe was taken to represent the amount of transported SL-verapamil. This was verified by the centrifugation experiment (Fig. 6). Free spin probe concentration in the lumen was calculated using the molar partition coefficient and inner leaflet lipid concentration (see “Materials and Methods” for further details). Calculated results for the experiment shown in Fig. 6are illustrated schematically in Fig. 7. After maximum transport, the luminal SL-verapamil concentration was 289 μm. There was a 12.6-fold gradient of SL-verapamil between both aqueous phases across the membrane. In addition, there was a 10.6-fold concentration gradient between the outer and inner leaflets of the vesicle. In another series of transport experiments the concentration of SL-verapamil was varied from 10 to 380 μm. It was found that the final luminal aqueous phase concentration increased with increasing external aqueous SL-verapamil, and the aqueous phase gradient varied in the range 7–25-fold (data not shown). For reasons discussed later, these gradients are underestimates of the true gradients and represent minimal estimates. Fig. 8 shows spin-labeled verapamil transport with various concentrations of ATP. From the initial rates of SL-verapamil transport the apparent K m for ATP activation of transport was found to be 0.77 mm. This value is similar to that obtained by conventional ATPase assay. The maximum transported amount of SL-verapamil was not dependent on ATP concentration nor on initial rate of transport, suggesting that vesicles, in which transport occurred, were tightly sealed and that there was no significant leakage rate. The hydrophobic vacuum cleaner model of drug transport by P-glycoprotein is supported by various studies (see Introduction). To examine and test this model, it is imperative to know the drug location during the transport process. For example, the actual concentration of drugs in the cytoplasmic leaflet directly affects enzyme activity because P-glycoprotein takes up its transport substrates from this leaflet. However, most of the transport substrates are highly hydrophobic and highly permeable to membranes. This feature of P-glycoprotein substrates causes numerous and insurmountable technical problems for mechanistic transport studies by conventional methods (reviewed in Ref. 21Sharom F.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 160: 161-175Google Scholar). EPR methods using spin-labeled transport substrates can overcome many of these problems and offer the following advantages. First, the location of spin probe is easily identified by mobility and accessibility tests without sample separation. Second, EPR techniques are highly quantitative and insensitive to calibration artifacts. Third, interpretation of EPR signals is relatively straightforward, and there are few associated interference problems. This is in stark contrast to the situation where the transport substrates used are fluorescence probes (e.g. Refs. 5Shapiro A.B. Corder A.B. Ling V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 115-121Google Scholar, 7Shapiro A.B. Ling V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 181-188Google Scholar, and 22Shapiro A.B. Ling V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 130-137Google Scholar), which are subject to many measurement artifacts including light-scattering, inner-filter effects, photobleaching, and multiple mechanisms of fluorescence quenching. Indeed, our new spin probe solved many previous technical problems and worked well in mechanistic studies of P-glycoprotein. Spin-labeled verapamil has several unique features. It is more hydrophilic than verapamil. The partition coefficient of SL-verapamil into olive oil was 120-fold smaller than that of verapamil. The fixed positive charge of the spin-labeled verapamil may have increased its hydrophilicity (Fig. 1). Even with this higher hydrophilicity SL-verapamil had apparent K m andK i values that were up to 10-fold lower than the corresponding values for verapamil. Thus SL-verapamil appears to exhibit high specific binding to P-glycoprotein. Additionally, SL-verapamil stimulated ATPase activity about 5-fold (Fig. 2) and was transported by P-glycoprotein (Fig. 5). Attachment of the nitroxide spin probe to verapamil resulted in a better transport substrate. The high hydrophilicity of SL-verapamil facilitates transport measurements. Transport studies were further aided by the very slow flip-flop rate of SL-verapamil in the bilayer (“Results”) in contrast to the relatively high flip-flop rate of verapamil (23Eytan G.D. Regev R. Oren G. Assaraf Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12897-12902Google Scholar). We believe that the fixed positive charge of SL-verapamil interacts with the negative surface dipole potential of the bilayer and also inhibits flip-flop activity across the thermodynamic barrier of the hydrocarbon core. For comparison, the translocation rate of TPP+ across membranes was only 0.001–0.01 s−1 (9Flewelling R.F. Hubbell W.L. Biophys. J. 1986; 49: 531-540Google Scholar). As SL-verapamil has a similar molecular topology and a larger size than TPP+, the flip-flop rate of our probe would be expected to be very slow. Prior to transport, the majority of SL-verapamil was located in the bulk water phase outside of vesicles yielding characteristic high mobility EPR signals (Figs. 3 C and 6). Once transported inside of the vesicles, most SL-verapamil was partitioned into the lipid bilayer, due to high internal lipid concentrations, yielding characteristic low mobility EPR signals (Figs. 3 D and 6). Thus, on addition of ATP, the concentration of free SL-verapamil decreased outside, and the concentration of lipid-partitioned SL-verapamil increased inside. Both parameters could be easily monitored and analyzed as shown in this study. Qualitative drug transport studies have long employed fluorescent transport substrates (e.g. Refs. 8Bolhuis H. van Veen H.W. Molenaar D. Poolman B. Driessen A.J. Konings W.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4239-4245Google Scholar and 24Homolya L. Hollo Z. Germann U.A. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21493-21496Google Scholar). Ling and colleagues (5Shapiro A.B. Corder A.B. Ling V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 115-121Google Scholar, 7Shapiro A.B. Ling V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 181-188Google Scholar, 22Shapiro A.B. Ling V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 130-137Google Scholar) employed fluorescent transport substrates where fluorescence intensities were high in the lipid phase and quenched in the aqueous phase precluding direct estimates of aqueous phase concentrations. In the latter studies, Pgp-mediated transport decreased total fluorescence in vesicular preparations, which was taken to indicate that drugs were transported into the luminal aqueous phase from the lipid phase. For this conclusion to hold, transport rates must be much higher than the drug-rebinding rate to the bilayer. Turnover was thus assumed to be limited by lipid drug-binding rates in apparent conflict with their own experimental observations (5Shapiro A.B. Corder A.B. Ling V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 115-121Google Scholar). However, alternative mechanisms of fluorescence quenching are also possible,e.g. self-quenching in inner leaflet at the high concentrations achieved (5Shapiro A.B. Corder A.B. Ling V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 115-121Google Scholar, 25Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 238-264Google Scholar) leading to different interpretations of the results. In contrast, we found that the binding rate of SL-verapamil to lipid was fast, and the transport rates were relatively slow and rate-limiting (see under “Results”). As a consequence, on transport, SL-verapamil rapidly partitioned into the inner leaflet of the bilayer in our case. Another great advantage of our transport studies is that they can be performed with pure Pgp in defined proteoliposomes as opposed to crude plasma membrane vesicle preparations required for transport studies using membrane fluorescent probes (5Shapiro A.B. Corder A.B. Ling V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 115-121Google Scholar). For the results of Fig. 6, SL-verapamil concentration in the outer leaflet was 250 μm in equilibrium with 23 μm free external probe (Fig. 7). Interestingly, net transport ceased after 10–20 min even though there was sufficient external substrate in the aqueous phase. This was not due to steady state equilibrium between transport and leakage, as we did not detect SL-verapamil leakage from vesicles after addition of EDTA or vanadate (Fig. 5). Also the mobility of lipid-partitioned spin probe at the steady state was not significantly changed, and vesicles were still intact. Thus transport was not inhibited by increased membrane fluidity (26Regev R. Assaraf Y.G. Eytan G.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 18-24Google Scholar). Another unlikely possibility for net transport termination was that the concentration of SL-verapamil reached the maximum binding capacity of the membrane. In the case of Fig. 6, SL-verapamil in the inner lipid layer was only 2.7 mm (values up to 29 mm were observed when more SL-verapamil was used). The lipid to spin probe ratio of 425 was also significantly smaller than the maximum binding capacity for TPP+ (9Flewelling R.F. Hubbell W.L. Biophys. J. 1986; 49: 531-540Google Scholar). The most likely possibility, which was also supported by kinetic simulations, 2M. K. Al-Shawi, unpublished results. is that the high concentration of luminal SL-verapamil directly inhibited Pgp activity by inhibiting drug unloading from the low affinity site. Experimentally determined luminal concentrations of SL-verapamil were in a range similar to determined K i values (see “Results”). If the low affinity drug-binding site faces the lumen (27van Veen H.W. Margolles A. Müller M. Higgins C.F. Konings W.N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2503-2514Google Scholar), then the luminal drug concentration may correlate with theK d value for this site. Furthermore, the ratio ofK i to K m would correlate with the maximum potential gradient formation by Pgp. In our case, the ratio ofK i to K m for SL-verapamil was 16 under transport conditions. In good agreement with this, P-glycoprotein generated a 13-fold gradient (range 7–25-fold in other experiments) between the luminal and outside aqueous phases and an 11-fold gradient between the lipid leaflets (Fig. 7). Our calculations only generate minimal estimates of the gradient, which is expected to be larger, because the calculations were based on the assumption that all vesicles were tightly sealed (no open sheets) and were uniformly spherical. Our new EPR approach resolved the technical problems of drug transport studies and is useful for understanding the molecular mechanism of drug transport and energy coupling by P-glycoprotein. We thank Dannon M. Smith for excellent technical assistance. We also thank Dr. Eduardo Perozo for helpful discussions and for the use of the EPR spectrometer."
https://openalex.org/W1985888036,"The rules of the genetic code are established in reactions that aminoacylate tRNAs with specific amino acids. Ambiguity in the code is prevented by editing activities whereby incorrect aminoacylations are cleared by specialized hydrolytic reactions of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. Whereas editing reactions have long been known, their significance for cell viability is still poorly understood. Here we investigated <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> four different mutations in the center for editing that diminish the proofreading activity of valyl-tRNA synthetase (ValRS). The four mutant enzymes were shown to differ quantitatively in the severity of the defect in their ability to clear mischarged tRNA<i>in vitro</i>. Strikingly, in the presence of excess concentrations of α-aminobutyrate, one of the amino acids that is misactivated by ValRS, growth of bacterial strains bearing these mutant alleles is arrested. The concentration of misactivated amino acid required for growth arrest correlates inversely in a rank order with the degree of the editing defect seen <i>in vitro</i>. Thus, cell viability depends directly on the suppression of genetic code ambiguity by these specific editing reactions and is finely tuned to any perturbation of these reactions."

Plant. 1992; 85: 561-566Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 42Li X.-Z. Oaks A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 1251-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The protein has a short half-life, which allows an efficient down-regulation of the nitrate metabolism under unfavorable conditions (42Li X.-Z. Oaks A.

In addition, NR can be rapidly inactivated by phosphorylation (44Kaiser W.M. Spill D. Plant Physiol. 1991; 91: 970-974Crossref Google Scholar, 45Douglas P. Morrice N. MacKintosh C.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Apparently the N-terminal part of the enzyme is essential for this regulation (49Nussaume L. Vincentz M. Meyer C. Boutin J.-P. Caboche M. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 611-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To which extent and why plastids exert their photosynthetic control on NR activity in the cytosol and NR gene expression in the nucleus is mainly unknown. This study monitored for the first time the changes in expression of the chimeric NIA2promoter::UIDA gene fusions in transgenic tobacco seedlings, the NIA2 transcript accumulation inArabidopsis and NR activity in three different species (Lemna, Arabidopsis, and tobacco) in parallel after physiological modulation of photosynthetic electron transport. Using photosystem-specific excitation in combination with electron transport inhibitor experiments on whole seedlings we demonstrate that the efficiency of photosynthetic electron flow affects the transcriptional rate and transcript pool size of the nuclear gene as well as the NR enzyme activity in a coordinated manner underlining the importance of photosynthesis as regulator of nitrate assimilation pathway components in plastids, cytosol, and nucleus. All tobacco (wild-type and transgenic lines, Samsun NN) and Arabidopsis(var. Columbia, or Landsberg in comparison with the phytochrome A mutant in the same background) seedlings were grown in Petri dishes with 0.5× strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium (50Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (54339) Google Scholar) supplemented with 2% sucrose in a temperature controlled growth chamber at 22 °C. Seedlings were either kept in PSI or PSII light for 18 days or they were transferred from one light source to the other 96 h before harvest. The spectral quality and light quantity of the PSI- and PSII-light sources (51Pfannschmidt T. Nilsson A. Allen J.F. Nature. 1999; 397: 625-628Crossref Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 52Pfannschmidt T. Nilsson A. Tullberg A. Link G. Allen J.F. IUBMB Life. 1999; 48: 1-6Crossref Google Scholar) as well as the characterization of the acclimation process of the tobacco seedlings to the two light sources have been described earlier (53Pfannschmidt T. Schütze K. Brost M. Oelmüller R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36125-36130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The acclimation of Lemnasprouts and of Arabidopsis (Landsberg erecta) seedlings has been analyzed in this study (see below). White light control plants were illuminated continuously for 18 days with 30-watt white stripe lamps (OSRAM) with a photon flux density of 100 μE. After 18 days, the seedlings were harvested and prepared for the determination of NR or β-glucuronidase (GUS) activity. The electron transport inhibitors DCMU and DBMIB (Sigma) have been applied to wild-type and transgenic plants as described (53Pfannschmidt T. Schütze K. Brost M. Oelmüller R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36125-36130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Control seedlings were treated with the solvent without inhibitors. DBMIB treatment was repeated every 3–4 h during the last 96 h of experimentation. Stock solutions of DCMU were 10 mm in 50% ethanol and of DBMIB 100 mm in 10% Me2SO in ethanol. Sublethal effects of used inhibitor concentrations (10 μm for DCMU and 25 μm for DBMIB) have been determined and described earlier (53Pfannschmidt T. Schütze K. Brost M. Oelmüller R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36125-36130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The different inhibitor concentrations were prepared by dilution in sterile water directly prior to use. For RNA isolation Arabidopsis wild-type seedlings were grown for 14 days under PSI or PSII light and were then switched to the respective other light source for 8 h. In inhibitor experiments plants were treated with 10 μm DCMU or 25 μm DBMIB just before this light switch. Untreated controls remained 14 days and 8 h under PSI or PSII light. The propagation, growth conditions, growth media, and temperature were described by Appenrothet al. (54Appenroth K.-J. Teller S. Horn M. Biol. Plant. 1996; 38: 95-106Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar), except that the medium was supplemented with 50 mm glucose. Wild-type and mutant strains (1073, see Ref.55Bruce B.D. Malkin R. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 203-212PubMed Google Scholar) were treated identically. After 2 weeks in white light, sprouts were transferred to darkness for 3 days before shifting them to PSI or PSII light for 48 h. After acclimation, sprouts were transferred to the respective other light source for an additional 48 h, and NR activity was assayed. The NIA2 promoter fromArabidopsis was isolated using classical strategies. A genomic Arabidopsis library was constructed in λgt10, and a positive phage was isolated using a NIA2 cDNA fragment as a probe. Sequence analysis confirmed that the phage contained theNIA2 sequence. Using PCR, we amplified ∼3.6 kbp of the 5′-flanking region. At the 5′-end we used a vector-specific oligonucleotide, at the 3′-end we designed a primer that ends directly before the ATG codon. After the complete sequence of theArabidopsis genome became available, our results were confirmed: NIA2 is located on chromosome 1 and our 5′-flanking region corresponds to the BAC F28L22 sequence 59370–62005. The DNA fragment was inserted into the SmaI site of pBI101 (56Jefferson R.A. Kavanagh T.A. Bevan M.W. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3901-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (8352) Google Scholar) and transformed into Nicotiana tabacum (Samsun NN) via Agrobacterium tumefaciens (57Lübberstedt T. Oelmüller R. Wanner G. Herrmann R.G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 602-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). 35 transgenic lines were regenerated after selection on kanamycin (100 μg/ml). F3 seedlings of 6 lines that showed the highest expression level of the reporter gene were used for these studies. For the initial characterization of the transgenic lines, F3seedlings were grown on solidified half-strength MS media for 18 days in either light or darkness. The media were either not supplemented or supplemented with nitrate (15 mm), cytokinin (N6-benzylaminopurine, 10−5m), abscisic acid (10−5m), sucrose (2%), or norflurazon (10−5m). For electron transport inhibitor experiments seedlings were sprayed with DCMU or DBMIB as described above. Seedlings were harvested and immediately put into X-gluc solution (50 mg X-gluc; 1 ml of dimethylformamide; 4.9 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0; 250 μl of Me2SO; 500 μl of potassium hexacyanoferrate (III) (100 mm); 500 μl of potassium hexacyanoferrate (II) (100 mm)) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. After washing with water, the seedlings were incubated in 70% ethanol and stored at 4 °C. For GUS staining of root hairs, seeds were germinated and seedlings were grown in liquid MS media to avoid hair damage. In vivoChla fluorescence parameters were measured with a pulse amplitude-modulated fluorometer (PAM101/103; Heinz Walz, Effeltrich, Germany). Arabidopsis seedlings and Lemna sprouts were arranged densely, so that the fluorescence of several seedlings/sprouts could be measured simultaneously under the emitter/detector unit. Fluorescence parameters were determined as described previously (53Pfannschmidt T. Schütze K. Brost M. Oelmüller R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36125-36130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The steady-state fluorescence Fs was calculated as Ft − Fo′ = Fs. Fluorescence-quenching parameter qP (photochemical quenching) was calculated as qP = (Fm′ − Fs)/(Fm′ − Fo) (58Schreiber U. Schliwa U. Bilger W. Photosynth. Res. 1986; 10: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (2396) Google Scholar). The effective quantum yield of PSII (φ PSII) was calculated as φ PSII = (Fm′ − Fs)/Fm′ (59Genty B. Briantais J.M. Baker N.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 990: 87-92Crossref Scopus (7061) Google Scholar). Total RNA from 3–5 g of leaf material was isolated following a protocol modified from Chomczynski and Sacchi (60Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies). RT-PCR analysis was performed by reverse transcription of 5 μg of total RNA with gene-specific reverse primers (see below) for Arabidopsis NIA2 and 18S rRNA genes using a first strand cDNA synthesis kit (K1631) (MBI Fermentas, St. Leon-Roth, Germany) followed by 20 PCR cycles. Gene-specific primer pairs for amplification of NIA2and 18ScDNAs were as follows: NIA2: forward primer, 5′-ATG GCG GCC TCT GTA GAT AAT CGC CC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CCT CGT GAC ATG GCG TCG TAA TCA CGG-3′; 18S: forward primer, 5′-GGT AGG CGA TTG GCT AAC ATT GTC TGC-3; reverse primer, 5′-GAG ACA CCA ACA GTC TTT CCT CTG CG-3′. PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized bands were quantified with the ImageMaster Video system (Amersham Biosciences). The NR and GUS assays were described earlier (14Deng M.-D. Moureaux T. Cherel I. Boutin J.-P. Caboche M. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1991; 29: 239-247Google Scholar, 57Lübberstedt T. Oelmüller R. Wanner G. Herrmann R.G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 602-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In both instances the system of reference was an equal amount of fresh weight. Saccharose was determined with an analytical kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (716260, Ingelheim, Germany). All NR activity data are based on seven independent experiments. The GUS values are based on independent experiments with the F3 seedling populations of six independent lines; all experiments were repeated seven times. To analyze the regulation of NR gene expression under various environmental conditions as well as its spatial expression characteristics in whole plants, we generated transgenic tobacco plants with a chimeric Arabidopsis NIA2 promoter::UIDA gene fusion (see “Experimental Procedures”). The isolated 3.6-kbp promoter region differed only in 3 positions in the far upstream region from the sequence, which is now available in the data bank (GenBankTM acc. no. F28L22, see “Experimental Procedures”). Initial primer extension analyses identified 3 major transcription start sites (59, 88, and 152-bp upstream of the ATG codon), the most prominent one being located 88-bp upstream of the ATG codon (data not shown), which is consistent with previous results (36Lin Y. Hwang C.F. Brown J.B. Cheng C.L. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). F3 seedlings from six independent transgenic lines were used for initial physiological and histological studies (TableI and Fig.1). GUS gene expression was significantly stimulated by light. The application of cytokinin, abscisic acid, sucrose, norflurazon, DCMU, and DBMIB had only small effects on the NIA2 promoter-driven reporter gene expression in the dark, only nitrate could activate it significantly. Additional illumination, however, led to a stimulation of promoter activity in each case. This becomes especially apparent when combinations of nitrate, sucrose, and cytokinin treatments were used (data not shown). As only exception, norflurazon treatment of seedlings, which completely prevents plastid biogenesis (61Oelmüller R. Photochem. Photobiol. 1989; 49: 229-239Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar), resulted in an inhibitory effect either when applied alone or in combination with other positive regulators (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the transgene responds similarly to the applied regulatory compounds or signals as described in other studies with NR (see the Introduction) and confirm at least partial transcriptional regulation of NR.Table IGUS activity in tobacco lines harboring NIA2 promoter∷UIDA gene fusionsTreatmentDarknessWhite lightNone100175Nitrate275566Cytokinin133341Abscisic acid83200Sucrose82600Norflurazon11675DCMU89185DBMIB128160Seedlings were grown on half-strength MS medium in either darkness or white light for 18 days, and whole seedlings were used for determination of the GUS activity. The medium was supplemented with nitrate, cytokinin, abscisic acid, sucrose, or norflurazon. As control unsupplemented medium was used. DCMU and DBMIB were sprayed directly on the seedlings. Results are based on seven independent experiments with six independent primary transformants.

Results are based on seven independent experiments with six independent primary transformants. Activity of untreated dark-grown plants was taken as 100%, and all other values were expressed relative to it. Maximal S.E. was ± 8%. For experimental details; see “Experimental Procedures.” Further GUS staining experiments indicate that the promoter is active in shoots and roots (Fig. 1). If seedlings are grown under conditions that allow extensive root formation and subsequent analysis of GUS staining (see “Experimental Procedures”), the high expression level in root hairs becomes obvious. Irrespective of the system of reference (fresh weight or protein content), ∼20% of the total GUS activity in white light-grown seedlings is found in roots, while more than 40% is detectable in roots of etiolated seedlings. More detailed studies uncovered that the activity in shoots is up-regulated by light and the functional stage of the plastids while the GUS level in the roots is more or less constitutively expressed (data not shown). This suggests that light regulation of NR in shoots is limited to photosynthetic active tissue. Therefore, all subsequent physiological studies were performed solely with cotyledons from seedlings grown under different light conditions. Transgenic tobacco lines with PSI promoter::UIDAreporter gene constructs have been demonstrated to represent a useful tool to investigate photosynthetic redox signaling pathways between plastids and the nucleus (53Pfannschmidt T. Schütze K. Brost M. Oelmüller R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36125-36130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Therefore the tobacco lines with theNIA2 promoter::UIDA gene fusion offered the opportunity to determine in an identical experimental setup whether light regulation of the Arabidopsis NIA2 promoter activity is coupled to photosynthetic electron transport. In this setup transgenic tobacco seedlings were grown under light sources favoring either PSI or PSII. Such light sources induce imbalances in the excitation of the two photosystems, and shifts between them can be used to generate oxidation or reduction signals from photosynthetic electron transport (51Pfannschmidt T. Nilsson A. Allen J.F. Nature. 1999; 397: 625-628Crossref Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 52Pfannschmidt T. Nilsson A. Tullberg A. Link G. Allen J.F.

Furthermore, in this system exogenous application of sublethal concentrations of electron transport inhibitors DCMU and DBMIB, which do not block, but limit the photosynthetic electron transport allow to confirm a coupling of photosynthetic electron transport and transgene promoter activity (53Pfannschmidt T. Schütze K. Brost M. Oelmüller R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36125-36130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). By performing such experiments with the tobacco lines carrying theNIA2 promoter::UIDA gene fusion we determined that PSI light stimulated and PSII light inhibited theArabidopsis NIA2 promoter activity (Fig.2). Conversely, PSI light grown plants (PSI plants) which were shifted to PSII light (PSI → II plants) showed a decrease in the NIA2 promoter activity while PSII light-grown plants (PSII plants) exhibited the opposite reaction after a shift to PSI light (PSI → I plants). We then added DCMU and DBMIB in the same way as described previously (53Pfannschmidt T. Schütze K. Brost M. Oelmüller R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36125-36130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) in order to manipulate the redox signal generated by the photosynthetic electron transport. Both inhibitors had no or only small effects on the NIA2 promoter activity in PSI plants but activates it significantly in PSII plants. These data are consistent with that obtained in the light-shift experiments and demonstrate that NR transcription is coupled to photosynthetic electron transport. To analyze if the regulation of the NIA2 promoter activity is reflected in transcript abundance and if the transgene expression in tobacco correlates with the situation in Arabidopsis we monitored the NIA2 transcript pool size by RT-PCR inArabidopsis seedlings, which were grown under the same conditions as the transgenic tobacco lines. The NIA2 RT-PCR product (Fig. 3, 1120 bp) exhibited essentially the same regulation as the promoter::reporter gene constructs; under PSI light the seedlings contain high amounts ofNIA2 transcripts (Fig. 3, lane 2), a shift to PSII light for only 8 h decreased the NIA2 transcript abundance (Fig. 3, lane 3) whereas pretreatment with DCMU and DBMIB abolished this repression (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and5). In PSII light-grown plants only small amounts ofNIA2 transcripts could be detected (Fig. 3, lane 7) while a shift to PSI light increased the transcript pool size (Fig. 3, lane 8). A preceding inhibitor treatment had no negative effect on this activation (Fig. 3, lanes 9 and10). Nitrate reductase is also highly regulated at the level of enzyme activity. To elucidate if the observed redox regulation extends to the enzyme activity tobacco has been grown under the different light regimes and NR activity was determined (Fig. 4). Under PSI light NR activity was higher than under PSII light. Furthermore shifts between these light sources resulted in corresponding changes of NR activity, i.e. a PSI → II light shift repressed the enzyme activity whereas a PSII → I light shift increased it. These results are consistent with those obtained at the transcriptional level. To obtain additional support for the coupling of NR activity to photosynthetic electron transport, which did not rely on inhibitor experiments, we included a muta"

Latent viruses, particularly the family of herpesviruses, have evolved numerous strategies to elude the innate and adaptive immune response. Such evasive maneuvers are specified by gene functions in the viral genome and include virus-encoded homologues of cellular immune regulators (1Ploegh H.L. Science. 1998; 280: 248-253Google Scholar).

To date, US28 is the only HCMV-encoded GPCR homologue that has been shown to be functional in vitro (2Gao J.-L. Murphy P.M. Nature. 1994; 269: 28539-28542Google Scholar). GPCR homologues have also been identified in other herpesviruses, among them the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV or HHV-8) (3Rosenkilde M.M. Waldhoer M. Luttichau H.R. Schwartz T.W. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1582-1593Google Scholar). Upon interaction with extracellular ligands, the chemokines, virally encoded GPCRs, transduce signals into the cell by activating a cascade of cellular processes, which is initiated by the activation of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins. The downstream activation of second-messenger pathways has been partially elucidated for Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus open reading frame 74 and HCMV-encoded US28 (4Smit M.J. Verzij D. Casarosa P. Navis M. Timmerman H. Leurs R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1744-1752Google Scholar, 5Billstrom M.A. Johnson G.L. Avdi N.J. Worthen G.S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5535-5544Google Scholar). The constitutive activity of virally encoded GPCRs was found to be associated with a variety of human diseases (6Leurs R. Smit M.J. Alewijnse A.E. Timmerman H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 418-422Google Scholar). More specifically, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus open reading frame 74 exhibits agonist-independent signaling via activation of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C that can abrogate normal growth control mechanisms and lead to oncogenic cellular transformation (7Arvanitakis L. Mesri E.A. Nador R.G. Said J.W. Asch A.S. Knowles D.M. Cesarman E. Blood. 1996; 88: 2648-2654Google Scholar, 4Smit M.J. Verzij D. Casarosa P. Navis M. Timmerman H. Leurs R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1744-1752Google Scholar). The US28-encoded receptor mediates high affinity binding to the CC-chemokines RANTES (CCL5), macrophage inflammatory polypeptide (MIP)-1α (CCL3), MIP-1β (CCL4), and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (CCL2) (8Kuhn D.E. Beall C.J. Kolattukudy P.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 325-330Google Scholar) and to the CX3C-chemokine fractalkine (CX3CL1) (9Kledal T.N. Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 209-214Google Scholar). In view of its pathogenic role, it was demonstrated that expression of US28 facilitated sequestration of extracellular CC chemokines from the environment of HCMV-infected cells (10Bodaghi B. Jones T.R. Zipeto D. Vita C. Sun L. Laurent L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.-L. Michelson S. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 855-866Google Scholar, 11Billstrom M.A. Lehman L.A. Scott-Worthen G. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 21: 163-167Google Scholar). Ligand binding to US28 has been shown to mediate intracellular Ca2+ flux (8Kuhn D.E. Beall C.J. Kolattukudy P.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 325-330Google Scholar) and leads to activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (5Billstrom M.A. Johnson G.L. Avdi N.J. Worthen G.S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5535-5544Google Scholar). Upon transient expression of US28 in COS-7 cells, US28 constitutively activates phospholipase C and NF-κB via a distinct Gq/11-mediated pathway, which is partially modulated by fractalkine (12Casarosa P. Bakker R.A. Verzijl D. Navis M. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Smit M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1133-1137Google Scholar). It was further demonstrated that HCMV infection of primary arterial smooth muscle cells results in significant cellular migration upon RANTES or monocyte chemotactic protein-1 production (13Streblow D.N. Soderberg-Naucler C. Vieira J. Smith P. Wakabayashi E. Ruchti F. Mattison K. Altschuler Y. Nelson J.A. Cell. 1999; 99: 511-529Google Scholar). Chemotaxis can be abrogated by deletion of US28 from the HCMV genome, thus providing a link between HCMV infection and acceleration of atherosclerosis. Surprisingly, epitope-tagged US28 receptors are located predominantly in perinuclear endosomes, possibly as a result of rapid constitutive, agonist-independent endocytosis and recycling of the receptor (14Fraile-Ramos A. Kledal T.N. Pelchen-Matthews A. Bowers K. Schwartz T.W. Marsh M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1737-1749Google Scholar). To gain more insight into the pathophysiological role of US28 signaling and subcellular distribution, we generated monoclonal antibodies (mAb) specific for the N-terminal extracellular domain of US28. These monoclonal antibodies specifically recognize US28 in its native form in transiently transfected HEK293A cells as well as in HCMV-infected fibroblasts. The native US28 receptor was largely absent from the cell surface; instead, the receptor was confined to intracellular organelles. In this study, we show that US28 is constitutively phosphorylated through a G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK)-mediated mechanism. We further identify amino acid residues within the US28 C terminus that are essential for the high basal receptor phosphorylation. Our data provide experimental evidence that such unique receptor phosphorylation is a prerequisite for the subcellular localization and for the constitutive agonist-independent endocytosis of the receptor. HEK293A cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 2 mm glutamine at 37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2. Human embryonic lung fibroblasts were maintained in culture medium containing 5% fetal calf serum and 10 mmHepes. The US28 sequence was amplified by PCR using a cosmid derived from the HCMV genome, strain AD169 (GenBankTM accession number X17403) as template. The PCR product flanked by a 5′ XbaI and a 3′HindIII restriction site was ligated into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1(−) (Invitrogen). PCR was employed to generate US28 mutants with serine to alanine mutations at Ser-315, Ser-319, Ser-323, Ser-325, Ser-327, Ser-330, Ser-331, Ser-333, Ser-338, Ser-339, Ser-343, and Ser-350 and threonine to alanine mutations at Thr-337 and Thr-341 by using degenerated primers. Plasmids containing FLAG-CCR5 and bovine GRK2 and GRK2/K220R have been described previously (15Oppermann M. Mack M. Proudfoot A.E.I. Olbrich H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8875-8885Google Scholar, 16Freedman N.J. Ligett S.B. Drachman D.E. Pei G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17953-17961Google Scholar). The NF-κB reporter plasmid 6NF-κBtkluc.neo was described elsewhere (17Bergmann M. Hart L. Lindsay M. Barnes P.J. Newton R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6607-6610Google Scholar), and pRL-TK plasmid was obtained from Promega. A glutathione S-transferase-US28 fusion protein (51 N-terminal amino acids) in pGEX-4T1 (AmershamBiosciences) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified according to standard procedures. All cDNA constructs were confirmed by sequencing. The mAbs Tub-45 (IgG2bκ) and Tub-6 (IgG2bκ) used in this study were raised by immunizing C57BL/6 mice with purified glutathioneS-transferase-US28 fusion protein in PBS and incomplete Freund's adjuvant in three two-weekly intervals followed by three final boosts. Fusions were performed according to standard procedures (18Köhler G. Milstein C. Nature. 1975; 256: 495-497Google Scholar). Hybridoma supernatants were screened by direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using glutathione S-transferase-US28 fusion protein or irrelevant glutathione S-transferase protein. Hybridomas were cloned by limiting dilution. The specificity of positively selected mAbs was further confirmed by immunoblot and flow cytometry analysis using HEK293A-US28 transfectants. Antibody isotyping was done by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, employing the mouse hybridoma subtyping kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). HEK293A cells were transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate method. To analyze GRK2- dependent phosphorylation of US28, a receptor plasmid was cotransfected with equal amounts of either GRK2, GRK2/K220R, or empty plasmid. For in vitro phosphorylation, cells were metabolically labeled 48 h after transfection with 200 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphoric acid (ICN) for 90 min and stimulated with RANTES, MIP-1α (R&D Systems) or PMA (Sigma). For inhibition of phosphorylation by fractalkine or for kinase inhibition experiments, labeling was carried out in the presence of fractalkine (R&D Systems) or kinase inhibitors (Calbiochem) as indicated. Phosphorylated cells were lysed in lysis buffer (PBS, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF) for 1 h at 4 °C and pelleted. Supernatants were precleared twice with 100 μl of a 50% slurry of Pansorbin®(Calbiochem) and 5 μl of normal mouse serum. US28 was immunoprecipitated from precleared lysates with mAb Tub-45 or Tub-6 immobilized on protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences), whereas FLAG-CCR5 was recovered with anti-FLAG mAb M2 (Sigma) bound to protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE using 13% gels, and radiolabeled receptors were visualized by autoradiography. Receptor phosphorylation levels were quantitated using a Fujix BAS 2000 image analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co.) and normalized to receptor protein loads, as assessed by immunoblotting. Briefly, blots were incubated with biotin-conjugated US28-specific mAbs Tub-45 followed by peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. Bound antibody was visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL,Amersham Biosciences), and receptor protein was quantitated by computer analysis (TINA 2.0, Raytest). For the determination of phosphoamino acids, 32P-labeled US28 receptor was excised from a dried SDS-PAGE gel and eluted by incubation in elution buffer (50 mm ammonium hydrogen carbonate, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol) for 16 h at 4 °C. The receptor was precipitated in 20% trichloroacetic acid and hydrolyzed in 6n HCl for 1 h at 110 °C. Hydrolysates were vacuum-dried, resolubilized in double-distilled H2O, and spotted on thin-layer cellulose plates (Merck) together with phosphoamino acid standards. Phosphoamino acids were separated by electrophoresis at pH 1.9 (formic acid/acetic acid/H2O, 50/156/1794 (v/v/v)) for 45 min at 1000 V followed by a second electrophoresis at pH 3.5 (pyridine/acetic acid/H2O, 10/100/1890 (v/v/v)) for 30 min at 1000 V in the orthogonal direction. Standard phosphoamino acids were stained by ninhydrin, and 32P-labeled phosphoamino acids were visualized by autoradiography. Human embryonic lung fibroblasts were infected with HCMV strain AD169 for various time points as indicated. After a 30-min starvation in methionine and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ICN), 2 × 106 cells were labeled with 200 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (Express protein labeling mix, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 90 min. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in PBS, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Subsequently, US28 was immunoprecipitated from cleared cell lysates with Tub-45 mAb as described under “Phosphorylation Experiments” in this section and resolved by 13% SDS-PAGE. Sample loads were normalized for radioactive counts. HEK293A cells grown in 6-well plates were transiently cotransfected with 6NF-κBtkluc.neo (100 ng/4 × 105 cells), pRL-TK (50 ng/4 × 105 cells) and either 100 ng/4 × 105cells of pcDNA3.1(−), US28, US28S1–12A, US28ST/A, or CXCR5. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed and incubated in serum-free medium for 6 h in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor-α or 100 nm fractalkine (R&D Systems). Cells were washed with PBS, lysed in 250 μl/well passive lysis buffer (Promega), and assayed for luciferase activity using the commercially available dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) in a Luminat LB 9507 (Berthold). HEK293A cells were transiently transfected for 24 h, washed, and seeded on coated glass slides. Cell surface receptors were stained 48 h after transfection by incubation with US28-specific mAb Tub-45 or anti-FLAG mAb (CCR5-FLAG) M2 on ice for 30 min followed by fixation in 5% paraformaldehyde, PBS (w/v) for 20 min at room temperature. For intracellular staining, cells were permeabilized after fixation with PBS, 0.1 % Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were blocked with PBS, 3% rat serum, and permeabilized cells were incubated with the receptor specific mAb for 60 min at room temperature. A 60-min incubation of a biotin-conjugated rat anti-mouse Ig antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was followed by a final incubation with streptavidin-conjugated Alexa Fluor® 568 (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at room temperature. Slides were mounted in Moviol (Calbiochem) and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy on a Leica DM IRBE (Leica). Images were collected using a digital camera (AxioCam™, Zeiss). For analysis of receptor expression by flow cytometry, cells were incubated with US28-specific mAb Tub-45 or anti-FLAG mAb M2 followed by incubation with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig Abs (Jackson Immunoresearch). Flow cytometric analysis was carried out with a FACSCalibur™ (Becton Dickinson), and 4 μm propidium iodide (Sigma) was added before measurement. Propidium iodide-positive cells were excluded from the analysis of cell surface expression. Detection of intracellularly located receptors was performed in cells that were fixed with 5% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.0025% digitonin (Sigma). Endocytosis assays were performed essentially as described (14Fraile-Ramos A. Kledal T.N. Pelchen-Matthews A. Bowers K. Schwartz T.W. Marsh M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1737-1749Google Scholar). Briefly, transiently transfected HEK293A cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 1 × 105/well. 24 h later, cells were washed with ice-cold binding medium (BM; RPMI 1640 without bicarbonate, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) and incubated in BM containing 125 pm125I-labeled RANTES for 2 h at 4 °C. To remove unbound ligand, cells were washed twice with ice-cold BM and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. Incubations were stopped by cooling the plates on ice and washing the cells with ice-cold BM. Four wells were used for each time point. For half of the wells, cells were washed twice in cold BM and lysed in 400 μl of 0.2 m NaOH (total cell-associated activity). To remove surface-bound radioligand, the remaining wells were washed twice for 3 min in RPMI 1640 without bicarbonate, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm MES, pH 2.7 (acid-resistant activity). After one wash with BM, cells were harvested as described above, and all lysates were transferred to tubes for γ-counting. The proportion of internalized radioligand was calculated by dividing the acid-resistant activity by the total cell-associated activity. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was assessed by the Student's ttest. It has been shown that epitope-tagged versions of the US28 receptor localize predominantly in intracellular organelles but only at marginal amounts at the plasma membrane, although this receptor efficiently binds its ligands and confers signals to downstream effector molecules at a high rate (14Fraile-Ramos A. Kledal T.N. Pelchen-Matthews A. Bowers K. Schwartz T.W. Marsh M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1737-1749Google Scholar). Because such unusual behavior of an epitope-tagged GPCR might not necessarily reflect the behavior of wild type (wt) receptor, we employed newly developed US28-specific mAbs to analyze native US28 expression in transient transfectants as well as in HCMV-infected fibroblasts. In flow cytometry analysis, US28 expression in transiently transfected HEK293A cells was detectable in permeabilized cells, whereas surface expression in non-permeabilized cells was marginal (Fig. 1 A). To exclude a cell type-specific peculiarity, we also tested transiently transfected HeLa cells and COS cells, obtaining identical results compared with HEK293A cells (data not shown). US28 gene transcription and US28 functional activity has been described in HCMV-infected primary fibroblasts. Using the US28-specific mAb Tub-45 in immunoprecipitation of 35S-labeled cells, we were able to resolve the kinetics of US28 protein expression in HCMV-infected human fetal lung fibroblasts. More specifically, US28 could be detected by immunoprecipitation as early as 48 h after infection, with a peak expression at 72–96 h (Fig. 1 B). This result supported our notion that the US28-specific mAbs Tub-45 and Tub-6 were able to detect native US28 receptor in transfected cell lines as well as in HCMV-infected primary cells. Because GPCR function and intracellular distribution are often regulated by receptor phosphorylation (19Ferguson S.S.G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24Google Scholar, 20Carman C.V. Benovic J.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 335-344Google Scholar), we analyzed such US28 receptor modification in transiently transfected HEK293A cells. Cells were labeled with 32Pi and stimulated with various chemokines. Receptors were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with the anti-US28 mAb Tub-45, which recognizes a US28-specific band of 36 kDa in SDS-PAGE (Fig2 A). We observed a high basal level of phosphorylation of US28, which could not be enhanced upon stimulation with the cognate ligands RANTES, MIP-1α, or the common PKC inductor PMA. It has been reported that the chemokine fractalkine acts as an inverse agonist on US28-mediated phospholipase C activation, resulting in down-modulation of phospholipase C-dependent second messenger molecules (12Casarosa P. Bakker R.A. Verzijl D. Navis M. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Smit M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1133-1137Google Scholar). Fractalkine, when added to transiently transfected HEK293A cells, resulted in partial inhibition of US28 basal phosphorylation (Fig. 2 B). Compared with the physiological receptor for RANTES and MIP-1α (i.e. CCR5), which exhibited a ligand-dependent phosphorylation and a low basal phosphorylation (Fig. 2 A), such constitutive ligand-independent phosphorylation is rather unique among chemokine receptors. In general, phosphorylation of GPCRs is mediated by ligand-induced GRKs or, alternatively, by second messenger dependent kinases. To probe potential mechanisms of US28 phosphorylation, we analyzed the amino acid sequence at the C terminus for potential consensus sites, accessible to serine/threonine kinases. Serines at positions 327 and 333 are potential candidates for PKC, whereas serine-331 and threonine-337 are located at potential phosphorylation sites of cAMP/cGMP-dependent kinases. Consensus sequences for casein kinase 2 were identified for threonine at positions 337 and 341 and serine 333. To assess the contribution of various kinases to US28 phosphorylation, we made use of pharmacological inhibitors. Treatment with the broad spectrum protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine or bisindolylmaleimide, a PKC specific inhibitor, or the casein kinase 2-specific inhibitor 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) reduced US28 phosphorylation to 63, 59, or 68% of basal levels, respectively (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, genistein treatment, an inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor kinase and other protein tyrosine kinases, had no inhibitory effect. We conclude that PKC and casein kinase 2 contribute partially to US28 receptor phosphorylation under agonist-independent conditions. None of the inhibitors tested was able to abrogate US28 phosphorylation completely, suggesting that alternative phosphorylation pathways must contribute to the constitutive phosphorylation of US28. The modulatory effect of the protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, AG490, on basal US28 phosphorylation provides a potential link to the role of the Jak family tyrosine kinases (Fig. 3 A). Among GRKs, the ubiquitously expressed GRK2 has a key role in regulating chemokine receptor phosphorylation (21Aragay A.M. Ruiz-Gomez A. Penela P. Sarnago S. Elorza A. Jimenez-Sainz M.C. Mayor Jr., F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 37-40Google Scholar). GRK-dependent phosphorylation of GPCRs could occur directly as phosphorylation of ligand-occupied receptor or indirectly as a result of GRK activation via PKC (19Ferguson S.S.G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24Google Scholar). Because basal US28 phosphorylation was partially PKC-dependent, we explored the ability of GRK2 to phosphorylate US28. Overexpression of GRK2 in HEK293A cells together with US28 resulted in a 2–3-fold increase in US28 phosphorylation. A dominant negative mutant of GRK2, GRK2/K220R, which lacks kinase activity, served as a negative control (Fig. 3B). Stimulation with RANTES did not significantly alter the phosphorylation status. In contrast, CCR5, when coexpressed with GRK2, showed a 5–6-fold enhanced phosphorylation upon stimulation with RANTES. The C-terminal domain of US28 contains 12 serine and 2 threonine residues that constitute potential phosphorylation sites for different kinases (Fig.4 A). To analyze which amino acids contribute to receptor phosphorylation in living cells, a two-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis of US28 transfectants (Fig.4 B) was performed. We observed a predominant phosphorylation of serine residues; in addition, a weak threonine phosphorylation was also detectable, but none on tyrosine residues. To localize the phosphorylated amino acid positions in more detail, we substituted the C-terminal serine and threonine residues with alanine. Substitutions of the C-terminal serine residues 3–5 (Ser-323, -325, -327), 6–8 (Ser-330, -331, -333), or 9–12 (Ser-338, -339, -343, -350) resulted in an impaired US28 phosphorylation (Fig. 4 C). Because this alteration was strongest for the S9–12A mutant, amino acids positions 338–350 most likely contain the majority of phosphorylation sites. Mutagenesis of serines 1 and 2 (Ser-315 and -319) did not alter US28 phosphorylation at all, indicating that these two residues display no phospho-acceptor sites. This conclusion is further confirmed by the observation that the S3–12A mutant, which preserved these first two serines, was phosphorylated at comparable levels to mutant S1–12A, lacking all C-terminal serines. As expected from the phosphoamino acid analysis, remaining phosphorylation of mutants S3–12A and S1–12A might be due to phosphorylation at threonine residues. An additional substitution of the threonine residues at positions 337 and 341 (ST/A mutant) did not lead to a further reduction of US28 phosphorylation. We conclude that C-terminal serines (Ser-323–Ser-350) contribute to basal US28 phosphorylation. Upon stimulation with the cognate ligand RANTES, no alteration in the phosphorylation status of any mutant receptor was observed. 2T. Mokros and U. E. Höpken, unpublished observations. It has been demonstrated (12Casarosa P. Bakker R.A. Verzijl D. Navis M. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Smit M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1133-1137Google Scholar) that US28 constitutively activates phospholipase C and the transcription factor NF-κB in COS-7 cells, transiently expressing US28. This effect was partially inhibited by the CX3C chemokine fractalkine. To investigate whether US28-induced NF-κB activity is dependent on receptor phosphorylation, we performed a reporter-gene assay. Plasmids encoding 6NF-κBtkluc and either US28 wt or US28 (S1–12A; ST/A) mutants were cotransfected into HEK293A cells. We observed constitutive activation of NF-κB upon expression of US28 wt, and essentially no differences to the US28 mutants (S1–12A; ST/A) were seen (Fig. 5). We conclude that a decreased phosphorylation of US28 did not lead to an impaired signaling via activation of NF-κB. Furthermore, US28-dependent NF-κB activity of both the US28 wt (Fig. 5) and mutant receptors (data not shown) was not significantly modulated upon stimulation with RANTES or fractalkine. Recently, it has been reported that epitope-tagged constructs or green fluorescent protein fusion proteins of US28 were expressed poorly at the cell surface and accumulated in intracellular organelles of transiently transfected HeLa cells (14Fraile-Ramos A. Kledal T.N. Pelchen-Matthews A. Bowers K. Schwartz T.W. Marsh M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1737-1749Google Scholar). Reduction or even loss of surface expression has been observed for many GPCRs upon ligand stimulation. Such cellular redistribution is the result of ligand induced endocytosis, which is facilitated in many cases by GRK2-mediated receptor phosphorylation (20Carman C.V. Benovic J.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 335-344Google Scholar, 19Ferguson S.S.G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24Google Scholar). Because GRK2 was capable of phosphorylating US28, we asked if the high basal US28 phosphorylation level was responsible for receptor endocytosis and low receptor display at the plasma membrane. US28 expression in transiently transfected HEK293A cells was detected in intracellular compartments, with the majority of the receptor localized in perinuclear structures, but not at the plasma membrane, as analyzed by immunocytochemistry (Fig.6 A). In contrast, the US28 mutant S1–12A, which lacks all C-terminal serine phosphorylation sites, showed a characteristic cell surface distribution, comparable with that observed for CCR5 (Fig. 6 A). To specifically address the influence of different C-terminal phosphorylation sites of US28 on plasma membrane localization, we tested all of the serine substitution mutants for cell surface expression. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that complete abrogation of serine phosphorylation (US28S1–12A, US28ST/A) resulted in a maximal surface expression of US28 (Fig. 6 B). By inhibition ofde novo protein synthesis with cycloheximide, we could largely exclude that enhanced surface expression was due to newly recruited receptor molecules.2 Single or combined deletions of phosphorylation sites in the additional serine mutants led to partial augmentation of surface expression, suggesting that single phosphorylation sites might have an additive effect on surface expression of US28. US28 undergoes rapid constitutive endocytosis and recycling, as demonstrated by radiolabeled antibody uptake and internalization of radiolabeled specific ligand (14Fraile-Ramos A. Kledal T.N. Pelchen-Matthews A. Bowers K. Schwartz T.W. Marsh M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1737-1749Google Scholar). To determine if high basal phosphorylation of US28 affects constitutive endocytosis, uptake of125I-labeled RANTES was compared between US28 wt and US28 mutant transfectants. Radiolabeled ligand bound to US28 wt receptor underwent rapid endocytosis, and receptor endocytosis was maximal after 60 min when ∼80% of the 125I-labeled RANTES initially bound to the cell surface was internalized. In contrast, mutation of phospho-acceptor sites in the C terminus of US28 (ST/A mutant) resulted in a significantly reduced 125I-labeled RANTES uptake already after 10 min (Fig. 7), suggesting that the endocytotic capacity of US28 is largely dependent on a constitutive receptor phosphorylation. To confirm that US28 wt and ST/A mutant receptor were expressed at comparable levels, we performed fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis with both receptor variants (data not shown). Because constitutive endocytosis is significantly down-regulated in the ST/A mutant, we conclude that rapid endocytosis and low surface expression of the native US28 receptor might be due to its high basal phosphorylation. It has been shown that the HCMV-encoded receptor US28 is constitutively active and undergoes rapid agonist-independent endocytosis. The mechanisms controlling such constitutive receptor down-regulation have not been characterized yet. Because agonist-dependent phosphorylation leads to rapid desensitization and internalization of GPCRs, we investigated whether constitutive signaling and internalization of US28 (12Casarosa P. Bakker R.A. Verzijl D. Navis M. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Smit M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1133-1137Google Scholar, 14Fraile-Ramos A. Kledal T.N. Pelchen-Matthews A. Bowers K. Schwartz T.W. Marsh M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1737-1749Google Scholar) might be linked to enhanced basal phosphorylation levels. Considerable basal phosphorylation levels have been described for another chemokine receptor, CXCR4 (22Orsini M.J. Parent J.-L. Mundell S.J. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31076-31086Google Scholar), and for some constitutively active GPCR mutants (19Ferguson S.S.G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24Google Scholar). As expected, phosphorylation of these receptors was further enhanced upon stimulation with their cognate ligands. In this study, we demonstrate that the virally encoded chemokine receptor US28 is constitutively phosphorylated. In contrast to the before-mentioned GPCRs, high basal phosphorylation of US28 in transiently transfected HEK293A cells was not altered upon stimulation with PMA or the cognate ligands RANTES and MIP-1α (Fig.2 A). Employing phosphoamino acid and mutational analysis, we identified phosphoserines located between Ser-323 and Ser-350 as the major phospho-acceptor sites on US28 (Fig. 4). Second messenger -dependent kinases like PKC and PKA, activated by Gq-coupled and Gs-coupled receptors, respectively, can participate in the phosphorylation of GPCRs (19Ferguson S.S.G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24Google Scholar). Once activated, second messenger-dependent kinases obtain the potential to phosphorylate not only ligand-occupied, but also free receptors, provided that phosphorylation consensus sequences exist. US28 was recently reported to constitutively activate phospholipase C via Gq/11 molecules in COS-7 cells (12Casarosa P. Bakker R.A. Verzijl D. Navis M. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Smit M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1133-1137Google Scholar). Thus, a phospholipase C-dependent activation of PKC could be hypothesized for the constitutive (ligand-independent) phosphorylation of US28. The PKC inhibitors staurosporine and bisindolylmaleimide used in our study partially inhibited constitutive US28 phosphorylation, but they were not able to abrogate it completely (Fig. 3 A). Thus, US28 mediated constitutive activation of phospholipase C, and subsequently PKC is not sufficient for a constitutive US28 phosphorylation in HEK293A cells. Together with our finding that inhibition of casein kinase 2 additionally decreased US28 phosphorylation, we propose that various second messenger-dependent kinases may participate in the regulation of agonist-independent US28 phosphorylation. This conclusion is supported by the observation that inhibition of tyrosine kinases with AG490 resulted in a 31% decrease in US28 phosphorylation (Fig.3 A). In the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation of US28, the influence of tyrosine kinases on US28 phosphorylation might be indirect. In addition to constitutive signaling through the phospholipase C pathway, ligand-independent activation of the transcription factor NF-κB as well as cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) have been described (12Casarosa P. Bakker R.A. Verzijl D. Navis M. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Smit M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1133-1137Google Scholar, 23Waldhoer M. Kledal T.N. Farrell H. Schwartz T.W. J Virol. 2002; 76: 8161-8168Google Scholar). We investigated the potential influence of constitutive receptor phosphorylation in regulating the activation of NF-κB mediated transcription. US28 mutants (S1–12A, ST/A) and US28 wt were equally effective in activating NF-κB (Fig. 5), suggesting that constitutive NF-κB activity is largely independent from receptor phosphorylation. We further assessed the effects of the chemokine fractalkine on the constitutive activation of NF-κB, since a role of fractalkine as a partial inverse agonist has been suggested recently (12Casarosa P. Bakker R.A. Verzijl D. Navis M. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Smit M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1133-1137Google Scholar). However, we failed to observe a regulatory effect of fractalkine on NF-κB activity in our experimental system (Fig. 5). Because all former studies have been performed in COS-7 cells instead of HEK293A cells, NF-κB activation can be regulated by multiple pathways, which might differ depending on cell type, GPCRs, and heterotrimeric G-protein subunit composition. Such differences might also account for fractalkine-independent constitutive NF-κB activation in US28-transfected HEK293 cells. In contrast to second messenger-dependent kinases, GRKs have been shown to preferentially bind and phosphorylate agonist-occupied receptors (24Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Google Scholar). When coexpressed, the ubiquitously occurring GRK2 isoform significantly increased US28 phosphorylation. When compared with other GPCRs, GRK2 enhanced phosphorylation of US28 was not altered upon RANTES stimulation (Fig. 3 B). It has been shown that PKCs can modulate GRK2 and GRK5 activity (25Winstel R. Freund S. Krasel C. Hoppe E. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2105-2109Google Scholar, 26Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3806-3812Google Scholar), thus providing a protein kinase cross-talk that may represent an alternative mechanism for the observed partial PKC dependence of the constitutive US28 phosphorylation. Our results indicate that US28 is a substrate for GRK2 and that both ligand-occupied and free US28 receptor represent targets for GRK2 phosphorylation. Epitope-tagged and fusion constructs of US28 exhibit low surface expression and localize predominantly to intracellular vesicles (14Fraile-Ramos A. Kledal T.N. Pelchen-Matthews A. Bowers K. Schwartz T.W. Marsh M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1737-1749Google Scholar). Such modifications might not necessarily reflect the behavior of a native receptor; therefore, we made use of our novel mAb, which specifically recognizes the native US28 receptor in transiently transfected HEK293A cells as well as in HCMV-infected human fibroblasts (Fig. 1). Immunostaining showed a preferential intracellular localization of US28 in transiently transfected HEK293A cells. US28 is known to undergo rapid constitutive internalization and recycling (14Fraile-Ramos A. Kledal T.N. Pelchen-Matthews A. Bowers K. Schwartz T.W. Marsh M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1737-1749Google Scholar). In general, internalization involves the GRK-dependent phosphorylation of activated GPCRs on cytoplasmic serine and threonine residues followed by the recruitment of β-arrestin and, subsequently, the internalization via clathrin-coated pits. Therefore, we asked if the constitutive phosphorylation of US28 is crucial for its rapid endocytosis and low surface expression. Flow cytometry analysis of US28 mutants revealed a reciprocal relationship between receptor surface display and number of phospho-acceptor sites. More specifically, maximal surface expression was detected for mutants with all C-terminal serines deleted (US28S1–12A and US28ST/A) (Fig. 6). The same mutants revealed a significant down-regulation of receptor endocytosis, as demonstrated by a reduced internalization of125I-labeled RANTES (Fig. 7). However, the effect observed was only incomplete, suggesting that endocytosis and subcellular redistribution of US28 might not be regulated exclusively by receptor phosphorylation. Various cellular factors can contribute additionally to the internalization of GPCRs, among them β-arrestin, AP-2, and dynamin (19Ferguson S.S.G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24Google Scholar). Amino acid motifs of the receptor C terminus might further enhance receptor internalization, as has been reported for CCR5 (27Venkatesan S. Petrovic A. Locati M. Kim Y.-O. Weissman D. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40133-40145Google Scholar, 28Kraft K. Olbrich H. Majoul I. Mack M. Proudfoot A. Oppermann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34408-34418Google Scholar) and CXCR4 (22Orsini M.J. Parent J.-L. Mundell S.J. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31076-31086Google Scholar). In view of the role of US28 in HCMV immune escape via chemokine sequestration, this study provides experimental evidence that constitutive receptor internalization and recycling are dependent on US28 phosphorylation. We are grateful to Prof. Dr. R. Heilbronn for providing us with a cosmid derived from the HCMV genome and Dr. S. Prösch for the HCMV strain AD169 and human embryonic lung fibroblasts."

Serpins are metastable in their native forms, and they ordinarily undergo conformational transition to a stable state only when they form a tight complex with target proteases. The metastable native form is thus considered to be a kinetically trapped folding intermediate. We sought to understand the nature of the serpin kinetic trap as a step toward discovering how conformational transition is regulated. We found that mutations of the B/C β-barrel of native α1-antitrypsin, a prototypical serpin, allowed conversion of the molecule into a more stable state. A 2.2 Å resolution crystal structure of the stable form (PDB code, 1IZ2) showed that the reactive site loop is inserted into an A β-sheet, as in the latent plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Mutational analyses suggest strongly that interactions not found in the final stable form cause the kinetic trap in serpin protein folding.

These studies have suggested that various unfavorable interactions, such as overpacking of hydrophobic side-chains, buried polar groups, and cavities may be responsible. However, the factors that prevent the conversion of these types of unfavorable interactions into more favorable ones remain unknown.The metastable native form of serpins is considered to be like a kinetically trapped folding intermediate because a more stable latent form can be produced from it under physiological (21Hekman C.M.

The native structure of serpins is converted into a stable structure when the physiological functions of these proteins are executed, that is, complex formation with a target protease. Tight regulation of this conversion is thus a crucial design principle of the serpin structure, and characterization of the kinetic trap is a key to understanding serpin structure-function relationships.Despite our knowledge of both the native and the latent structures, the molecular basis by which the kinetic trap prevents the native serpin from folding into a more stable state remains unknown. It has been suggested that native interactions in metastable proteins somehow prevent conversion into a more stable structure (24Carr C.M. Chaudhry C. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the present study, we tested whether destabilization of native interactions of α1AT can lower the kinetic barrier in folding into a more stable state.

https://openalex.org/W2130228740,"All eukaryotic organisms have mechanisms to adapt to changing metabolic conditions. The mammalian cell survival geneBcl-x L enables cells to adapt to changes in cellular metabolism. To identify genes whose function can be substituted by Bcl-xL in a unicellular eukaryote, a genetic screen was performed using the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae. S. cerevisiae grows by anaerobic glycolysis when glucose is available, switching to oxidative phosphorylation when carbohydrate in the media becomes limiting (diauxic shift). Given that Bcl-xL appears to facilitate the switch from glycolytic to oxidative metabolism in mammalian cells, a library of yeast mutants was tested for the ability to efficiently undergo diauxic shift in the presence and absence of Bcl-xL. Several mutants were identified that have a defect in growth when switched from a fermentable to a nonfermentable carbon source that is corrected by the expression ofBcl-x L. These genes include the mitochondrial chaperonin TCM62, as well as previously uncharacterized genes. One of these uncharacterized genes, SVF1, promotes cell survival in mammalian cells in response to multiple apoptotic stimuli.

Further characterization of the genes identified in this screen may enhance our understanding of Bcl-xLfunction in mammalian cells, and of cell survival pathways in general. Multicellular organisms use complex mechanisms to regulate cell survival in an effort to maintain tissue homeostasis. When individual cells become damaged or fail to compete for limiting amounts of nutrients and survival factors in their environment, a common response is programmed cell death. Although much progress has been made toward identifying the molecules and signaling pathways that allow cells to respond appropriately to these environmental cues, understanding how specific proteins function biochemically to regulate these pathways remains controversial (1Rathmell J.C. Vander Heiden M.G. Harris M.H. Frauwirth K.A. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 683-692Google Scholar). The Bcl-2 family of proteins contains both pro- and antiapoptotic proteins that are important regulators of programmed cell death (2Martinou J.C. Green D.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 63-67Google Scholar). Expression of antiapoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-xL, serves to promote cell survival in response to multiple cellular stresses including growth factor/nutrient deprivation and genotoxic damage. In contrast, expression of proapoptotic proteins, such as Bax and Bak, is required for the efficient elimination of cells (3Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Google Scholar, 4Lindsten T. Ross A.J. King A. Zong W.X. Rathmell J.C. Shiels H.A. Ulrich E. Waymire K.G. Mahar P.

Bcl-2 proteins appear to act at the mitochondria to affect cell survival (5Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Google Scholar). Bcl-2 proteins regulate cytochrome credistribution from the mitochondrial intermembrane space to the cytosol (2Martinou J.C. Green D.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 63-67Google Scholar, 6Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S. Gross A. Ashiya M. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2060-2071Google Scholar). Once in the cytosol, cytochrome c can activate caspases, which through their proteolytic activity cause the morphological features of programmed cell death (7Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Bcl-2 proteins regulate cytochrome c release and cell survival has remained the topic of much debate. It has been proposed that Bcl-2 proteins impact on cell survival pathways through their effect on metabolism and mitochondrial physiology (8Vander Heiden M.G. Thompson C.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E209-E216Google Scholar). Cells lose the ability to utilize glucose via glycolysis prior to undergoing programmed cell death (9Vander Heiden M.G. Plas D.R. Rathmell J.R. Fox C.J. Harris M.H. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5899-5912Google Scholar). Despite an inability to inhibit the metabolic changes that impair glucose utilization, Bcl-xL allows cells to maintain oxidative phosphorylation and adapt to the change in cellular metabolism. Bcl-xL may facilitate this metabolic switch by allowing the continued transport of metabolites across the outer mitochondrial membrane (10Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Li X.X. Schumacker P.T. Colombini M. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4666-4671Google Scholar). This hypothesis predicts that the regulation of outer mitochondrial membrane transport is critical to ensure cell survival under conditions of decreased glycolysis. All eukaryotic species with mitochondria would be expected to experience conditions where carbohydrates needed for glycolysis are limited. Therefore, this model predicts that all eukaryotic species must have evolved mechanism(s) to maintain metabolite flux across the outer mitochondrial membrane during periods of nutrient deprivation and cellular stress. To date there have been no proteins with sequence homology to Bcl-2 discovered outside of animal species. Nevertheless, Bcl-xLdemonstrates structural and functional homology to a family of bacterial pore-forming proteins in the absence of any primary sequence similarity (11Schendel S.L. Montal M. Reed J.C. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 372-380Google Scholar, 12Harris M.H. Thompson C.B. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1182-1191Google Scholar). Furthermore, the regions of sequence homology that exist within the Bcl-2 family of proteins are restricted to domains that are known to mediate interactions between members of the Bcl-2 family, and with other components of the metazoan cell death machinery (5Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Google Scholar, 13Sattler M. Liang H. Nettesheim D. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Eberstadt M. Yoon H.S. Shuker S.B. Chang B. Minn A.J. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.W. Science. 1997; 275: 983-986Google Scholar). It is possible that all eukaryotic organisms have maintained proteins that function similarly to Bcl-xL, but have evolved in the absence of other apoptotic proteins and hence lack sequence homology. Alternatively, it is possible that different eukaryotic organisms regulate mitochondrial metabolite transport by different mechanisms. There is evidence that Bcl-2 proteins retain at least some of their functions in yeast. Expression of Bax or Bak is toxic to bothSaccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and this toxicity can be rescued by co-expression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL even when mutations are present that prevent the physical association between pro- and antiapoptotic proteins (14Greenhalf W. Stephan C. Chaudhuri B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 169-175Google Scholar, 15Hanada M. Aime-Sempe C. Sato T. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11962-11969Google Scholar, 16Jurgensmeier J.M. Krajewski S.

Similar to its effect on mammalian cells, Bax expression in yeast causes changes in mitochondrial membrane potential and promotes cytochrome c release from the mitochondrial intermembrane space (17Minn A.J. Kettlun C.S. Liang H. Kelekar A. Vander Heiden M.G. Chang B.S. Fesik S.W. Fill M. Thompson C.B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 632-643Google Scholar). In addition, Bax expression inhibits oxidative phosphorylation in yeast, and Bax toxicity is enhanced by yeast mutations that impair metabolite exchange across the outer mitochondrial membrane (19Harris M.H. Vander Heiden M.G. Kron S.J. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3590-3596Google Scholar). Genetic screens using S. cerevisiae have identified both yeast and mammalian genes that can suppress Bax toxicity (20Matsuyama S. Xu Q. Velours J. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 327-336Google Scholar, 21Xu Q. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 337-346Google Scholar), and Bcl-2 has been shown to promote long term survival of yeast cells in stationary phase cultures (22Longo V.D. Ellerby L.M. Bredesen D.E. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1581-1588Google Scholar). These studies suggest that Bcl-2 proteins, including Bcl-xL, act within a conserved pathway to regulate at least some aspects of cell biology common to yeast and animal cells. To identify potential genes whose function can be substituted byBcl-x L in S. cerevisiae, a genetic screen was performed. When supplied with glucose, S. cerevisiae grow by fermentation and switch to oxidative phosphorylation only when carbohydrate in the media becomes limiting (23DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Google Scholar). This change from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation is called diauxic shift. Given that Bcl-xL appears to facilitate the switch from glycolytic to oxidative metabolism in mammalian cells and prevents Bax-mediated inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation in yeast, a library of yeast mutants was tested for a diauxic shift defect complemented by Bcl-x L. Several candidate mutants were identified that demonstrate a defect in growth following diauxic shift that was suppressed by the expression ofBcl-x L. Characterization of these yeast genes has the potential to improve the understanding of Bcl-xLfunction in cell survival. Yeast studies were performed with S. cerevisiae W303 (ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11.15, leu2-3.112, trp1-1, ura3-1) maintained on YPD or selective synthetic complete medium prepared as described previously (19Harris M.H. Vander Heiden M.G. Kron S.J. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3590-3596Google Scholar). ForBcl-x L expression, the humanBcl-x L cDNA was cloned into the pOW4 expression plasmid and transformed into yeast by standard protocols. The pOW4-Bcl-x L plasmid is a CEN plasmid containing theURA3 gene for selection and ADH1 promoter for Bcl-x L expression. Gene deletions were generated by replacing the coding sequence with a kanMX4 cassette that confers resistance to G418. Yeast were transformed with a kanMX4-containing PCR product flanked by 50 bp of upstream and downstream sequences. Deletions were selected on YPD media containing 0.2 mg/ml G418 and confirmed by PCR (24Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Google Scholar). Yeast carrying pOW4-Bcl-x L were transformed with a transposon-mutagenized genomic library as described previously (25Burns N. Grimwade B. Ross-Macdonald P.B. Choi E.Y. Finberg K. Roeder G.S. Snyder M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1087-1105Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μg of library DNA was digested with NotI overnight and used to transform logarithmically growing cells by standard lithium acetate techniques. Transformants were selected on synthetic media lacking leucine. Two independently generated pools of transposon-mutagenized yeast carrying the pOW4-Bcl-x L plasmid were cultured at room temperature overnight in liquid synthetic complete media (2% glucose) lacking uracil. These cultures were plated on solid YPEG media (2% yeast extract, 1% BactoPeptone, 3% glycerol, 3% ethanol) and grown for 2 days at 30 °C. The colonies were replica plated onto synthetic complete media (2% glucose) lacking uracil and synthetic complete media (2% glucose) containing 1 mg/ml 5-fluroorotic acid (FOA). 1The abbreviations used are: FOA, 5-fluroorotic acid; IL-3, interleukin 3. After culturing overnight (less than 18 h) at 30 °C, the colonies were again replica plated from both the uracil-deficient and FOA-containing plates onto YPEG and the colony growth on these plates was scored over time. Colonies were selected for decreased growth on the YPEG replica plated from FOA when compared with the YPEG replica plated from uracil-deficient plates. The two independently generated pools of mutants were equally represented. The colonies were retested using the identical conditions of the screen. Genomic DNA was prepared from the respective yeast strains using standard protocols and the site of transposon insertion determined by vectorette PCR as described previously (26Riley J. Butler R. Ogilvie D. Finniear R. Jenner D. Powell S. Anand R. Smith J.C. Markham A.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2887-2890Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μg of genomic DNA was digested overnight with AluI and annealed anchor bubble primers (5′-GAAGGAGAGGACGCTGTCTGTCGAAGGTAAGGAACGGACGAGAGAAGGGAGAG and 5′-GACTCTCCCTTCTCGAATCGTAACCGTTCGTACGAGAATCGCTGTCCTCTCCTTC) were ligated to the genomic DNA fragments. PCR was used to amplify the insertion site using an mTn3 library specific probe (5′-CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGA) and a probe homologous to the reverse complement of the anchor bubble sequence (5′-CGAATCGTAACCGTTCGTACGAGAATCGCT). The resultant PCR product was then isolated and sequenced. To measure diauxic shift in liquid culture, overnight cultures of the specified yeast were normalized and plated at an optical density measured at 600 nm (A 600) = 0.002 in both synthetic complete media deficient in uracil and synthetic complete media containing FOA. Growth of the cultures was followed byA 600 over time and the glucose concentration in the media was measured at each time point using a commercially available kit (Sigma). When cultures obtained anA 600 of close to 1.0 (and a [glucose] >0.4 mg/dl) the cultures were washed, normalized, and plated at anA 600 = 0.015 in YPEG media. Growth of the culture in YPEG was similarly followed by A 600. To assay temperature-sensitive growth, respective yeast strains were normalized to the same A 600 and 10-fold serial dilutions were plated to YPD and YPEG solid media and cultured for 4 days as indicated. The murine interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent FL5.12 cell line was cultured as described previously (10Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Li X.X. Schumacker P.T. Colombini M. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4666-4671Google Scholar). The human prohibitin cDNA was isolated by PCR using primers 5′-CAGAGTGAAAGCAGGTGTGAGTGG and 5′-AGCATGATGGAGGCCGTGGCCCGG. TCM62, SVF1, and prohibitin were cloned into the pSFFV-neo mammalian expression vector and transfections were carried out using 10 μg of plasmid electroporated into 1 × 107 cells at 960 microfarads and 250 V. Neomycin-resistant cells were selected with 1 mg/ml G418. For growth factor withdrawal, cells were washed three times in media lacking IL-3 and then cultured in IL-3-deficient media for the times indicated. For apoptosis induction by chemotherapeutic agents, cells were treated with 10 μg/ml etoposide, 0.1 μg/ml vincristine, or 5 μg/ml cisplatin as indicated. For γ-irradiation, viability was measured after exposing cells to 20 gray using a cesium source emitting 2.86 gray/min. In all cases viability was measured at the indicated time points by propidium iodide exclusion using flow cytometry as described previously (27Minn A.J. Rudin C.M. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Blood. 1995; 86: 1903-1910Google Scholar). To screen S. cerevisiae for genes that can be functionally complemented by a Bcl-x L gene, aS. cerevisiae strain was generated carrying a plasmid driving constitutive expression of human Bcl-x Lselectable by uracil auxotrophy. The expression of functional Bcl-xL in this strain was confirmed by both Western blot and the ability to protect against Bax toxicity (data not shown). This Bcl-xL-expressing strain was subjected to insertional mutagenesis using a previously reported transposon-generated library (25Burns N. Grimwade B. Ross-Macdonald P.B. Choi E.Y. Finberg K. Roeder G.S. Snyder M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1087-1105Google Scholar). In total, 40,000 independent gene disruptions were screened as outlined in Fig. 1. To screen for clones that were unable to efficiently undergo diauxic shift in the absence of Bcl-xL, the mutant yeast library was initially plated on the nonfermentable carbon source glycerol to select against mutations that would result in a petite phenotype. Petite yeast have lost genes necessary for oxidative phosphorylation and therefore have no ability to grow on a nonfermentable carbon source. Bcl-xL expression is unable to rescue the petite phenotype. Colonies able to form on glycerol were replica plated to glucose-containing media lacking uracil to select for retention of the Bcl-x L-containing plasmid, and to media supplemented with FOA to select for loss of theBcl-x L-containing plasmid. After ∼15 h, the colonies were then replica plated back to glycerol media and differences in growth were noted over time between colonies from uracil-deficient media (cells with Bcl-xL) and colonies from FOA-containing media (cells without Bcl-xL). Among those colonies that exhibited growth on both uracil-deficient and FOA-containing media, 134 were initially scored as exhibiting decreased growth on glycerol when replica plated from FOA media as compared with the colonies on glycerol when replica plated from uracil-deficient media. No colonies exhibited growth on FOA-containing media but not on uracil-deficient media, and the 18 colonies that failed to grow on glucose media with FOA were scored separately. These 18 colonies included mutants deficient in uracil uptake, leading to FOA lethality independent of the presence of Bcl-xL. After retesting the 134 candidate mutants, 8 exhibited the same dependence on Bcl-xL for efficient diauxic shift. The site of transposon insertion was determined for the 8 clones and 6 were found to have insertions within an open reading frame, with the remaining 2 in noncoding DNA or ribosomal RNA sequences. None of the insertions were cloned more than once, suggesting that the screen did not saturate the genome. Of the transposon insertions within open reading frames, all were in different genes, three of which were previously identified, one of which has a proposed name, and two of which are hypothetical open reading frames (TableI). Given the possible role ofYDR346C in cell survival, we termed this geneSVF1 for survival factor1.Table ISites of transposon insertion identified in mutants impaired in their ability to undergo diauxic shift that were complemented by Bcl-xLCloneLocus of Tn3 insertionFunction of gene1TCM62Mitochondrial chaperone2APE2Deaminase, dCTP/dTTP synthesis3DCD1Leucine aminopeptidase4SWR1 (YDR334W)Putative helicase5SVF1 (YDR346C)Unknown6YOR008C-AUnknown7rRNAgeneSignificance unclear8Between PHO86 andNCA3Significance unclear Open table in a new tab Of the named genes, APE2, DCD1, and TCM62 have known cellular functions. APE2 encodes a metallopeptidase important for obtaining leucine from leucine-containing dipeptide substrates. DCD1 encodes a deaminase necessary for dCTP and dTTP synthesis. APE2 and DCD1 were not examined further in the current study. TCM62 encodes a mitochondrial membrane protein that has been reported to function as a chaperonin for mitochondrially encoded polypeptides, and is necessary for proper folding and assembly of several subunits of the succinate dehydrogenase complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (28Dibrov E. Fu S. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32042-32048Google Scholar). The name SWR1 was proposed for YDR334Wafter its identification in a genetic screen for suppressors of yeast impaired in nuclear transport. Swr1 is a putative helicase related by sequence to Swi2/Snf2 that may be involved in chromatin remodeling, possibly in response to cellular stress.YOR008C-A is a very small open reading frame that includes a potential transmembrane domain. SVF1 is another open reading frame that has sequence homology with genes in other fungus species, but has no known cellular function. To confirm that the observed defect in diauxic shift is the result of gene disruption by the transposon, strains carrying complete deletions of the genes were generated in yeast carrying the URA3plasmid with Bcl-x L. To test for a defect in diauxic shift, wild-type and tcm62Δ strains were cultured in glucose media lacking uracil or glucose media containing FOA until they reached an A 600 between 1.0 and 1.5. At this time point none of the cultures had reached stationary phase and all of the strains had greater than 0.4 g/dl of glucose remaining in the media (data not shown). Cells were normalized, washed, and resuspended in fresh glycerol-containing media, and growth of the culture was measured by A 600 over time. Wild-type andtcm62Δ yeast proliferated at a similar rate in glucose-containing media regardless of the presence of Bcl-xL (data not shown). However, when compared with wild-type yeast, tcm62Δ yeast exhibited slower growth upon switch to glycerol-based media (Fig.2 A). Yeast deficient inTCM62 also could not proliferate to the same density in culture as wild-type yeast following diauxic shift. WhereasBcl-x L expression had no effect on the ability of wild-type yeast to grow in glycerol, tcm62Δ yeast with Bcl-xL demonstrated a significant improvement in growth when compared with tcm62Δ yeast lackingBcl-x L. Bcl-x L expression intcm62Δ yeast allowed them to grow to a slightly greater density, but was unable to completely rescue this phenotype. When compared with wild-type yeast, yeast null for SVF1 also demonstrate a decreased rate of growth and grew to a lower density upon switch to glycerol-based media (Fig. 2 B). However, unliketcm62Δ yeast, svf1Δ yeast expressingBcl-x L exhibit growth comparable with wild-type. Neither swr1Δ nor yor008c-aΔ showed a consistent phenotype that was rescued by Bcl-xL in liquid culture (data not shown). Given that Bcl-xL was able to at least partially rescue a defect in the ability to efficiently carry out diauxic shift in tcm62Δ and svf1Δ yeast, these two genes were characterized further. It has been previously reported that deletion of TCM62results in viable cells that exhibit a partial defect in growth on a nonfermentable carbon source at higher temperatures (29Klanner C. Neupert W. Langer T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 365-369Google Scholar). To determine whether svf1Δ yeast also have a temperature-sensitive growth defect on a nonfermentable carbon source, serial dilutions of wild-type and svf1Δ yeast were spotted onto glucose- and glycerol-containing medium and cultured at either 30 or 37 °C. When compared with wild-type yeast, svf1Δ yeast demonstrated decreased growth on glycerol at the higher temperature (Fig.3 A). Expression ofBcl-x L had no effect on the growth defect observed in svf1Δ yeast when they were cultured on glycerol at 37 °C (Fig. 3 B). When tcm62Δ yeast were similarly tested, the growth defect on glycerol at 37 °C was not rescued by Bcl-x L expression (data not shown). These data suggest that whereas Bcl-xL improves the kinetics of growth on glycerol when switched from glucose, it does not alter the end point of growth. Taken together, these data suggest thatBcl-x L expression can rescue some but not all of the functions of the genes identified in the screen. To determine whether further study of the genes identified in this screen might lend insight into the mechanism of Bcl-xL-mediated cell survival, the ability of Tcm62 to alter cell survival in mammalian cells was examined. TCM62was stably transfected into the IL-3-dependent murine pro-B cell line FL5.12, and viability was assessed after growth factor withdrawal. TCM62-transfected cells demonstrated a small but consistent increase in survival when compared with control-transfected cells (Fig. 4 A). Bcl-xL expression has been shown to increase cell survival in response to multiple apoptotic stimuli. To determine whether Tcm62 could also improve mammalian cell survival following apoptotic stimuli other than growth factor withdrawal, control- andTCM62-transfected cells were treated with the chemotherapeutic agent etoposide or exposed to ionizing radiation. Bcl-xL expression inhibits apoptosis following either treatment (27Minn A.J. Rudin C.M. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Blood. 1995; 86: 1903-1910Google Scholar). In contrast to results observed following growth factor withdrawal, Tcm62 had no effect on cell survival in response to etoposide treatment or γ-irradiation (Fig. 4 B). Similar results were obtained following treatment with cisplatin and vincristine (data not shown). These data suggest that unlike Bcl-xL, Tcm62 can improve cell survival in mammalian cells in response to some, but not all, apoptotic stimuli. To determine whether SVF1 can substitute forBcl-x L function in mammalian cells, FL5.12 cells were stably transfected with SVF1 or a control vector and deprived of growth factor. Expression of SVF1 inhibits cell death when compared with control cells (Fig.5 A). To determine whether Svf1 could protect mammalian cells from cellular stresses other than growth factor withdrawal, SVF1- and control-transfected cells were treated with etoposide, vincristine, or exposed to γ-irradiation. Svf1 inhibits cell death following treatment with each of these chemotherapeutic agents (Fig. 5, B–D). These data suggest that Svf1 promotes cell survival in mammalian cells following a variety of apoptotic stimuli. Svf1 has no obvious homologues in mammalian cells. However, Tcm62 is functionally analogous to prohibitin, a chaperonin found in mammals that is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Like Tcm62, prohibitin binds to newly synthesized mitochondrial translation products and facilitates their assembly into respiratory chain complexes (30Nijtmans L.G. de Jong L. Artal Sanz M. Coates P.J. Berden J.A. Back J.W. Muijsers A.O. van der Spek H. Grivell L.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2444-2451Google Scholar, 31Nijtmans L.G. Artal S.M. Grivell L.A. Coates P.J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 143-155Google Scholar). To confirm that the survival advantage conferred by Tcm62 was because of a physiological function of the protein, we examined the ability of prohibitin to also inhibit cell death in mammalian cells. FL5.12 cells were transfected with prohibitin or control vector and subjected to IL-3 withdrawal. Whereas the majority of control-transfected cells were dead after 2 days of growth factor withdrawal, prohibitin expression conferred increased resistance to cell death (Fig. 6 A). The ability of prohibitin to rescue cells from IL-3 withdrawal was similar to the rescue seen with TCM62 expression after 2 days of growth factor deprivation (Fig. 6 B). These data suggest that expression of mitochondrial chaperonins confers resistance to cell death following growth factor withdrawal in mammalian cells. To verify that increased propidium iodide exclusion was accurately reflecting increased cell survival, FL5.12 cells transfected with SVF1, TCM62, prohibitin, or control plasmid were withdrawn from IL-3 for 3 days, followed by transfer into media containing IL-3. Clonogenic recovery and expansion after IL-3 withdrawal was enhanced in SVF1, TCM62, and prohibitin transfectants relative to the Neo-transfected control (Fig.7 A). In addition, factors that slow cell cycle progression may increase the apparent resistance of cells to apoptotic induction as measured by propidium iodide exclusion. To determine whether Svf1, Tcm62, or prohibitin affect the rate of mammalian cell proliferation,SVF1-, TCM62-, prohibitin-, or control-transfected cells were cultured continuously in exponential phase for 6 days (Fig. 7 B). The rates of cell proliferation appear to be nearly identical in all four lines: the ability of these genes to protect cells from apoptosis cannot be explained by an effect on proliferation. These observations confirm that screening S. cerevisiae for genes that can be complemented byBcl-x L is a valid approach to gain further insight in the regulation of cell survival. Together these data suggest that Bcl-xL has a biochemical function that is capable of partially rescuing loss of function mutations in S. cerevisiae. Despite complete genomic information for two species, yeast lack genes with primary sequence homology to caspases, Ced-4/Apaf-1-like genes, andBcl-2. This argues that Bcl-xL has a biochemical activity that can be separated from the cell death signal transduction machinery. Whether the primary function of Bcl-xL in mammalian cells is different from the biochemical function of Bcl-xL manifested in yeast, or if the same activity is responsible for its effects on mammalian cell survival is not known. Considerable evidence suggests that the presence of Bcl-xLaffects mitochondrial physiology and the regulation of cellular metabolism (8Vander Heiden M.G. Thompson C.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E209-E216Google Scholar). Following growth factor withdrawal,Bcl-x L expression allows for continued oxidative phosphorylation and maintains cellular ATP levels despite decreased glycolysis (9Vander Heiden M.G. Plas D.R. Rathmell J.R. Fox C.J. Harris M.H. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5899-5912Google Scholar). Bcl-xL facilitates this change in metabolism by promoting the continued transport of metabolites across the outer mitochondrial membrane (10Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Li X.X. Schumacker P.T. Colombini M. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4666-4671Google Scholar). An explanation for these findings comes from experiments demonstrating that Bcl-xLmaintains the voltage-dependent anion channel, the primary channel for metabolite transport across the outer mitochondrial membrane, in an open configuration (32Vander Heiden M.G. Li X.X. Gottleib E. Hill R.B. Thompson C.B. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19414-19419Google Scholar). These data have led to the hypothesis that Bcl-xL promotes cell survival by permitting continued coupling of metabolism between the cytosol and mitochondria, allowing the cell to adapt to changes in nutrient availability. The finding that Bcl-xL improves the growth of yeast deficient in a mitochondrial chaperonin supports this hypothesis. Tcm62 is a member of a class of mitochondrial chaperonins that exist in all eukaryotic cells. Proper assembly of the mitochondrial respiratory chain is a complex event that requires the aid of several molecular chaperones including Tcm62, Abc1, Bcs1, Atp10, Atp11, and Atp12 in yeast (28Dibrov E. Fu S. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32042-32048Google Scholar). The prohibitin gene product belongs to a similar class of proteins (30Nijtmans L.G. de Jong L. Artal Sanz M. Coates P.J. Berden J.A. Back J.W. Muijsers A.O. van der Spek H. Grivell L.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2444-2451Google Scholar). Prohibitin was initially cloned as a tumor suppressor gene and has a known impact on replicative life span and mitochondrial membrane potential (31Nijtmans L.G. Artal S.M. Grivell L.A. Coates P.J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 143-155Google Scholar, 33Dell'Orco R.T. McClung J.K. Jupe E.R. Liu X.T. Exp. Gerontol. 1996; 31: 245-252Google Scholar, 34Coates P.J. Jamieson D.J. Smart K. Prescott A.R. Hall P.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 607-610Google Scholar). Whereas Bcl-xL itself is not likely to act as a chaperone, Bcl-xL may enable the mitochondria to overcome a deficit in properly folded components of the oxidative phosphorylation machinery either by enhancing mitochondrial efficiency or enhancing tolerance of mitochondrial inefficiency. Similarly, it is possible that by improving the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial chaperones facilitate survival through cellular adaptation to glucose deprivation that occurs as a result of growth factor withdrawal. In contrast to Bcl-xL, Tcm62 does not inhibit apoptosis in response to chemotherapeutic agents. This selectivity may be because of a distinct mechanism by which cells sense growth factor withdrawal and genotoxic damage, suggesting that growth factor withdrawal and genotoxic damage affect mitochondria and cellular metabolism differently. The identification of unknown and poorly characterized genes in this screen may lend further insight into the mechanism by which Bcl-xL interacts with pathways important for responding to cellular stress. Two of the genes, SWR1 andYOR008C-A, have been identified in screens that deal with stress response. SWR1 was found in a screen for suppressors of nuclear transport mutants and may be involved in chromatin remodeling in response to stress signaling. YOR008C-A was identified in a screen in which its disruption resulted in an increased sensitivity to the mutagens diepoxybutane and mitomycin C. SVF1 is a previously uncharacterized gene. Loss ofSVF1 results in a temperature-sensitive growth defect on the nonfermentable carbon source. In addition to genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis such as TCM62, loss ofPOR1, the major voltage-dependent anion channel gene in S. cerevisiae, also results in a temperature-sensitive growth defect on glycerol (35Blachly-Dyson E. Song J. Wolfgang W.J. Colombini M. Forte M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5727-5738Google Scholar). Loss ofSVF1 also adversely affects the ability of yeast to efficiently undergo diauxic shift. Gene array studies have shown thatSVF1 mRNA levels do not change significantly during the diauxic shift (23DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Google Scholar). This suggests that the study of nontranscriptional processes is necessary to understand this metabolic transition. Despite an ability to inhibit apoptosis in mammalian cells,SVF1 exhibits homology only to other fungal genes. All species of fungus with extensive genomic information including S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, and Candida albicanspossess at least one homologue indicating that evolutionary pressure exists for conservation of the gene. The recent finding that yeast have a caspase-like activity in the absence of any proteins with sequence homology to mammalian caspases suggests that the mechanisms controlling cell survival in yeast may be more conserved than previously appreciated (36Madeo F. Herker E. Maldener C. Wissing S. Lachelt S. Herlan M. Fehr M. Lauber K. Sigrist S.J. Wesselborg S. Frohlich K.U. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 911-917Google Scholar). Similarly, it is possible that Svf1 possesses a known biochemical activity that is important for metazoan cell survival. Alternatively, Svf1 may define an as yet unknown family of proteins that facilitates adaptation to cellular stress. Further characterization of SVF1 as well as other genes found in this screen has the potential to lend insight into the evolution of metabolic regulation and cell survival pathways in both yeast and higher eukaryotes.

https://openalex.org/W2152586487,"TrwB is an integral membrane protein linking the relaxosome to the DNA transport apparatus in plasmid R388 conjugation. Native TrwB has been purified in monomeric and hexameric forms, in the presence of dodecylmaltoside from overexpressing bacterial cells. A truncated protein (TrwBΔN70) that lacked the transmembrane domain could be purified only in the monomeric form. Electron microscopy images revealed the hexameric structure and were in fact superimposable to the previously published atomic structure for TrwBΔN70. In addition, the electron micrographs showed an appendix, ∼25 Å wide, corresponding to the transmembrane region of TrwB. TrwB was located in the bacterial inner membrane in agreement with its proposed coupling role. Purified TrwB hexamers and monomers bound tightly the fluorescent ATP analogue TNP-ATP. A mutant in the Walker A motif, TrwB-K136T, was equally purified and found to bind TNP-ATP with a similar affinity to that of the wild type. However, the TNP-ATP affinity of TrwBΔN70 was significantly reduced in comparison with the TrwB hexamers. Competition experiments in which ATP was used to displace TNP-ATP gave an estimate of ATP binding by TrwB (K d(ATP) = 0.48 mm for hexamers). The transmembrane domain appears to be involved in TrwB protein hexamerization and also influences its nucleotide binding properties. TrwB is an integral membrane protein linking the relaxosome to the DNA transport apparatus in plasmid R388 conjugation. Native TrwB has been purified in monomeric and hexameric forms, in the presence of dodecylmaltoside from overexpressing bacterial cells. A truncated protein (TrwBΔN70) that lacked the transmembrane domain could be purified only in the monomeric form. Electron microscopy images revealed the hexameric structure and were in fact superimposable to the previously published atomic structure for TrwBΔN70. In addition, the electron micrographs showed an appendix, ∼25 Å wide, corresponding to the transmembrane region of TrwB. TrwB was located in the bacterial inner membrane in agreement with its proposed coupling role. Purified TrwB hexamers and monomers bound tightly the fluorescent ATP analogue TNP-ATP. A mutant in the Walker A motif, TrwB-K136T, was equally purified and found to bind TNP-ATP with a similar affinity to that of the wild type. However, the TNP-ATP affinity of TrwBΔN70 was significantly reduced in comparison with the TrwB hexamers. Competition experiments in which ATP was used to displace TNP-ATP gave an estimate of ATP binding by TrwB (K d(ATP) = 0.48 mm for hexamers). The transmembrane domain appears to be involved in TrwB protein hexamerization and also influences its nucleotide binding properties. Bacterial conjugation is a highly efficient and broad host range process during which DNA is transferred from a donor to a recipient bacterium across the envelope of both cells (for reviews, see Refs. 1Zechner E.L. de la Cruz F.

Conjugative DNA transfer requires three sets of plasmid-encoded proteins called Dtr (DNA transfer andreplication), Mpf (mating pairformation) (3Pansegrau W. Lanka E. Progress Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 197-251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a coupling protein (2Llosa M. Gomis-Rüth F.M. Coll M. de la Cruz F. Mol.

Dtr proteins process conjugative DNA through the formation of a nucleoprotein complex, the relaxosome, that cleaves and unwinds DNA in order to form the single DNA to be transferred (T-strand). The relaxosome “moves” to the transport site by means of the coupling protein, where the DNA transport apparatus (Mpf proteins) provides the pore for transport of the T-strand to the recipient cell (2Llosa M.

Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5795-5802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Llosa M. Bolland S. de la Cruz F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 448-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Only three plasmid-encoded proteins, TrwA, TrwB, and TrwC, together withoriT, are involved in R388 mobilization (6Llosa M. Bolland S. de la Cruz F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 448-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). TrwC acts as a relaxase and a DNA helicase. It is responsible for both nick cleavage at oriT and T-strand unwinding (7Grandoso G. Llosa M. Zabala J.C. de la Cruz F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 8Llosa M. Grandoso G. de la Cruz M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). TrwA is a small tetrameric protein, which binds two sites at oriT and enhances TrwC relaxase activity, while repressing transcription of thetrwABC operon (9Moncalián G. Grandoso G. Llosa M. de la Cruz F. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The R388 relaxosome is composed of TrwA and TrwC bound to oriT DNA together with the host protein IHF. The latter inhibits TrwC nic cleavage by affecting the topology of the DNA site where TrwC has to act. By so doing, it is thought to modulate R388 conjugation (10Moncalián G. Valle M. Valpuesta J.M. de la Cruz F. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1643-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The third plasmid-encoded protein necessary for R388 conjugative DNA processing is TrwB, which belongs to the coupling protein family. TrwB sequence analysis predicts an integral membrane protein of 507 residues (6Llosa M. Bolland S. de la Cruz F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 448-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 11Moncalián G. Cabezón E. Alkorta I. Valle M. Moro F. Valpuesta J.M. Goñi F.M. de la Cruz F. J. Biol.

Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar, 13Lanka E. Wilkins B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 141-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) and shared by the other coupling proteins (14Cabezón E. Sastre J.I. de la Cruz F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 254: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The transmembrane domain predicted by sequence analysis comprises the 70 N-proximal residues and includes two transmembrane helices and a small periplasmic domain in between. Although the coupling proteins appear to play an essential role in bacterial conjugation, few data are available on their biochemical mechanism. Protein TraD was the first coupling protein purified and subjected to biochemical analysis (15Panicker M.M. Minkley E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12761-12766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later, a soluble form of TrwB, lacking the N-terminal transmembrane segments and called TrwBΔN70, was purified (11Moncalián G. Cabezón E. Alkorta I. Valle M. Moro F. Valpuesta J.M. Goñi F.M. de la Cruz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36117-36124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (see below). Recently, His-tagged TraG (RP4) and TraD (F) and truncated HP0524 (Helicobacter pylori) have been purified and partially characterized (16Schröder G. Krause S. Zechner E.L. Traxler B. Yeo H.-J. Lurz R. Waksman G. Lanka E. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2767-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Apparently, problems of aggregation and solubility precluded a more exhaustive characterization of these proteins. The poverty of results obtained in vitro underscores the difficulty in handling integral membrane proteins. We observed that in the purification protocol, TrwBΔN70 behaved as a monomer. However, its crystal structure unveiled a molecule with six equivalent protein units (4Gomis-Rüth F.X. Moncalián G. de la Cruz F. Coll M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7556-7566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In this study, we have purified the integral membrane protein TrwB in its native form from an extract of TrwB-overproducing Escherichia coli cells. Unlike TrwBΔN70, TrwB appears in both monomeric and hexameric forms in solution. Since this behavior is different from the one corresponding to the TrwBΔN70 mutant, we infer that the transmembrane portion could play an important role in TrwB oligomerization. Our electron microscopy results support this theory and corroborate the TrwBΔN70 tridimensional structure. Moreover, hexameric TrwB has been found to bind ATP with a dissociation constant of ∼0.5 mm(i.e. in the order of magnitude of other ATP-binding proteins) (17Thomas P.J. Garboczi D.N. Pedersen P. J.

Open table in a new tab The oligonucleotides used in the present work were 1) GAAGGAGGATTCATATGCATCCAGA, which creates an NdeI site (underlined) and start codon at the N terminus of the trwB gene, 2) GATTTACCGGTACCAGT, which creates aKpnI site (underlined) at nucleotides 398–403 of thetrwB gene, and 3) GCAACACCGAGGTACCCGTACC, which creates aKpnI site (underlined) at nucleotides 404–409 of thetrwB gene and a K136T mutation in TrwB protein. In order to overproduce TrwB protein, plasmid pBU1 was constructed as follows. Plasmid pSU4623, which carries the trwB gene with a silent mutation to create a KpnI site (11Moncalián G. Cabezón E. Alkorta I. Valle M. Moro F. Valpuesta J.M. Goñi F.M. de la Cruz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36117-36124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), was used as template for a PCR with oligonucleotides 1 and 2 (see above). The resulting 423-bp fragment was digested with NdeI andKpnI (fragment 1). Simultaneously, pSU4623 was digested withKpnI and BamHI, the resulting 1.1-kb fragment was mixed with fragment 1, and this mixture was cloned inNdeI-BamHI-digested pSU4743 (pET-3a derivative) (20Ávila P. Nuñez B. de la Cruz F. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This resulting construction contains TrwB protein under the control of the T7 promoter. Plasmid pBU1 was transformed to and stored in strain D1210. For protein overproduction, plasmid pBU1 was introduced in E. coli BL21 C41 (DE3), a mutant strain of E. coli BL21 (DE3) (21Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). To overproduce TrwB-K136T, plasmid pBU2 was constructed as described before, and pSU4632 plasmid that carries the trwBK136T gene where the K136T mutation creates a KpnI site was used (11Moncalián G. Cabezón E. Alkorta I. Valle M. Moro F. Valpuesta J.M. Goñi F.M. de la Cruz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36117-36124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the latter case, oligonucleotides 1 and 3 (see above) were used for PCR. TrwB was routinely purified from inducedE. coli BL21 C41 (DE3) cells. Cultures (6 × 500 ml of LB with 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin) of E. coli BL21 C41(DE3) harboring the plasmid pUB1 were grown at 37 °C with shaking. At anA 550 of 0.6–0.8, isopropyl β-d−thiogalactopyranoside was added to a concentration of 1 mm. Cells were grown at 25 °C for 3 h. The cultures were centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 15 min; the cells were then resuspended in the remaining volume of LB and frozen in liquid N2. Frozen cells were thawed at 37 °C in 30 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 0.1 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.07% (w/v) of lysozyme. After 30 min at 0 °C, the cells were disrupted by sonication (10 s on/10 s off, 30 cycles) and centrifuged at 7000 × g for 15 min to sediment the nonlysed cells. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the pellet that constitutes the membrane fraction was resuspended in 15 ml of buffer A. For protein solubilization, membranes were treated with β-d-dodecylmaltoside (Apollo, Waley Bridge, Derbyshire, UK) and NaCl to a final concentration of 1% (w/v) and 600 mm, respectively. The membrane preparation (30 ml) was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with continuous stirring and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. TrwB was recovered from the supernatant (Fraction I, 30 ml) (Fig. 1). Fraction I was brought to 200 mm NaCl by the addition of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% β-d-dodecylmaltoside) and applied at 1 ml/min to a 40 ml of cellulose phosphate P-11 (Whatman) column (2.5 × 8 cm) equilibrated with buffer B supplemented with 200 mm NaCl. Proteins were eluted in two steps: 500 mm NaCl in buffer B (fraction II, 100 ml) and 1 m NaCl in buffer B (fraction II′, 50 ml). TrwB eluted in both steps. From this point on, fractions II and II′ followed separate, although parallel, purification protocols. Fraction II′ was diluted to 150 mm NaCl by the addition of buffer B and loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap-SP (Amersham Biosciences) column connected to an Amersham Biosciences FPLC 1The abbreviations used for: FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; TNP-ATP, 2′(or 3′)-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5′-triphosphate. system equilibrated with buffer B containing 150 mm NaCl. The column was washed with this buffer B until base line was reached. Proteins were then eluted from the column with a 150–1000 mm NaCl gradient in buffer B at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. TrwB, as a monomer, eluted at about 275 mm NaCl (Fraction III′-m, 30 ml), and the hexameric form eluted at about 710 mm NaCl (Fraction III′-h, 75 ml). Fraction III′-m was concentrated by Centriprep and Centricon YM-50 systems (Amicon) to a final volume of 5 ml and loaded onto a 120-ml Superdex HR 200 column (16 × 60 cm) (AmershamBiosciences) by using Amersham Biosciences FPLC equipment. Gel filtration was performed in buffer B with 200 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The peak fractions corresponding to the monomer were pooled (fraction IV′-m, 10 ml), and after glycerol was added to a 20% (w/v) final concentration, they were stored at −80 °C. Similarly, fraction III′-h was concentrated by Centriprep and Centricon YM-50 systems (Amicon) to a final volume of 250 μl and loaded onto a 24-ml Superose 6 column (10 × 30 cm) (AmershamBiosciences) by using FPLC equipment. Gel filtration was performed in buffer B with 200 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. The peak fractions corresponding to the hexamer were pooled (fraction IV′-h, 4.4 ml), glycerol was added to a 20% (w/v) final concentration, and the protein was stored at −80 °C. Fraction II was treated exactly as fraction II′ through the HiTrap-SP and Superdex HR-200, giving rise to a single, monomeric fraction IV (Fig. 1). The TrwB-K136T mutant protein was purified following the same purification protocol. All protein determinations were performed by the BCA method (Pierce). Anti-TrwB protein polyclonal antibodies were prepared using the method described by Harlow and Lane (22Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1988: 53-138Google Scholar). For antibody production, TrwB was purified by preparative SDS gel electrophoresis of a membrane fraction solubilized with Triton X-100 (1%, w/v) and applied first onto a DE52 (Whatman) column and then to a HiTrap Heparin (Amersham Biosciences) column. The band corresponding to the TrwB protein was cut out of the gel and used to immunize New Zealand White rabbits. The IgG fraction from the serum was purified by chromatography on a Protein A-Sepharose column. Separation of the inner (cytoplasmic) and outer membranes was carried out essentially as described by Osborn and Munson (23Osborn M.J. Munson R. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 642-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to exponential phase and then harvested. Cell pellets were resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.75 m sucrose, and 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme. Then spheroplasts were formed by dilution with 2 volumes of 1.5 mm EDTA and lysed by brief sonication. The total membrane fraction was obtained by ultracentrifugation and resuspension in 5 mm EDTA (pH 7.5) supplemented with 20% sucrose. Outer and inner membrane fractions were prepared by loading the total membrane fraction on a continuous sucrose density gradient from 34 to 70% and then centrifuging at 96,000 × gfor 16 h at 4 °C (Beckman rotor TST 28.38). Membrane fractions were identified through determination of specific activities as ketodeoxyoctonate and NADH oxidase for outer and inner membrane, respectively. Bacterial transformation with plasmid DNA was carried out by the CaCl2 method (24Cohen S.N. Chang A.C.Y. Hsu L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 2110-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (1842) Google Scholar). Genetic complementation analysis of the conjugal ability of TrwB was carried out as described by Llosa et al. (6Llosa M. Bolland S. de la Cruz F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 448-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Donor cells were selected on Tp + Ap, and transconjugants were selected on Sm + Tp. Aliquots of TrwB were applied to carbon grids, negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate. Images were taken in a JEOL 1200EX-II electron microscope operated at 100 kV and recorded on Kodak SO-163 film at 60,000× nominal magnification. Micrographs were digitized at a 3.5 Å/pixel resolution using a Eikonix IEEE-488 camera. 860 side view particles and 530 top view particles of TrwB were extracted and aligned by cross-correlation free-pattern methods (25Marco S. Chagoyen M. de la Fraga L.G. Carazo J.M. Carrascosa J.L. Ultramicroscopy. 1996; 66: 5-10Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and processed using the XMIPP package (26Marabini R. Masegosa I.M. San Martı́n C. Marco S. Fernández J.J. de la Fraga L.G. Vaquerizo C. Carazo J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Resolution of the final average images of both side and top views was estimated by the spectral signal/noise ratio method (27Unser M. Trus B.L. Steven A.C. Ultramicroscopy. 1987; 23: 39-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) to be 25 and 27 Å, respectively. The nucleotide binding properties of TrwB were studied using a fluorescent ATP analogue, namely TNP-ATP (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) (28Hiratsuka T. Uchida K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 320: 635-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed at 25 °C using a PerkinElmer MPF-66 spectrofluorometer, with spectral bandwidths of 5 and 10 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. Proteins were suspended in buffer A supplemented with 0.05% (w/v) β-d-dodecylmaltoside and 20% (w/v) glycerol. All spectra were corrected for buffer fluorescence and for dilution (never exceeding 5% of the original volume). When the extrinsic fluorescence of TNP-ATP was studied, excitation was performed at 410 nm, and emission was scanned in the 470–650-nm range. TNP-ATP binding was determined from the increase in fluorescence at 560 nm in the presence of TrwB protein (29Grubmeyer C. Penefesky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3718-3727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Titration curve fitting was accomplished using SigmaPlot 2001 for Windows, Version 7.0 (SPSS Inc.) with the following quadratic equation in the case of increasing TNP-ATP fluorescence, F=Fmin+{(Fmax−Fmin)[(Et+L+Kd(TNP­ATP))−((Et+L+Kd(TNP­ATP))2−4EtL)½]}/2EtEquation 1 where F represents the relative fluorescence intensity, F min is the relative fluorescence intensity at the start of titration, F max is the fluorescence intensity at saturating concentration of TNP-ATP (L), E t is the total concentration of TrwB, and K d(TNP-ATP) is the apparent dissociation constant of TrwB-substrate complex. In the case of displacement of bound TNP-ATP by ATP, the following quadratic equation was used, F=Fmax−{(Fmax−Fmin)[(Et+L+K0.5)−((Et+L+K0.5)2−4EtL)½]}/2EtEquation 2 were F max is the fluorescence intensity at start of the titration, and F min is the fluorescence at saturating concentration of ATP,K 0.5 in this equation represents the amount of ATP necessary to displace half the amount of bound TNP-ATP, andL represents ATP concentrations. Therefore, it is possible to calculate the apparent dissociation constant of TrwB-ATP complex (K d(ATP)) by using theK 0.5 value obtained from the displacement experiments and the following equation, Kd(ATP)=K0.5/{1+[L/Kd(TNP­ATP)]}Equation 3 where L represents TNP-ATP concentration at start of the titration. The purification scheme of TrwB is shown in Fig. 1 and described under “Materials and Methods.” We have purified TrwB to apparent homogeneity from extracts of Escherichia coli BL21 C41 (DE3) carrying thetrwB gene on a multicopy plasmid derived from pET3a. After induction with 1 mmβ-d−thiogalactopyranoside, cells were grown at 25 °C to avoid formation of inclusion bodies and to promote integration of the protein into the cytoplasmic membrane. Membrane integration at this stage helped in obtaining functionally active protein. Cells were harvested and membranes were obtained after breaking cells by sonication and subsequent centrifugation. After centrifugation, the following detergents were tested for TrwB solubilization: 1) 50 or 100 mm octyl glucoside; 2) 40 or 200 mm CHAPS; 3) 1% (w/v) Triton X-100; 4) 56 mm sodium cholate; 5) 1% (w/v) β-d-dodecylmaltoside. β-d-Dodecylmaltoside was the most effective in extracting TrwB from the membranes (data not shown). Furthermore, it was found that the addition of 600 mm NaCl improved protein solubilization. Solubilized membranes were chromatographed on a cellulose phosphate P-11 column from which two fractions were obtained, at low (fraction II) and high (fraction II′) salt concentrations, respectively. These two fractions were separately treated from this stage onwards (seeA and B, respectively, in Fig.2). Fraction II (Fig. 2 A,lane 2) was applied to a HiTrap-SP column and finally sieved on Superdex HR-200 where TrwB eluted to give 3.83 mg of homogeneous TrwB monomer (Fig. 2 A, lane 4). Fraction II′ was applied to a HiTrap-SP column, and the resulting subfractions III′-m and III′-h were respectively applied to a Superdex HR-200 column, to give 0.5 mg of homogeneous TrwB monomer (Fig.2 B, lane 4) and to a Superose-6 column to give 0.34 mg of homogeneous TrwB hexamer (Fig. 2 B,lane 6). The TrwB-K136T mutant protein was purified following the same purification protocol. However, the protein yield was strongly reduced in all fractions, and consequently only fraction II was obtained in significant amounts at the end of the purification. Thus, the studies involving the mutant protein were carried out with monomeric TrwB-K136T only. Note, however, that, although in small amounts, a fraction II′ of the mutant protein was obtained that, when processed through the HiTrap-SP column, could be resolved into monomers and hexamers (data not shown). We examined the localization of TrwB by using specific antibody detection. E. coli D1210 cells containing the R388 plasmid were grown to exponential phase and lysed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Membrane fractions were prepared, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. After immunoblotting, TrwB protein was specifically found in the inner membrane fractions of D1210 cells containing the R388 plasmid (Fig.3). This result is fully compatible with the putative function of TrwB as a connector of the relaxosome (in the cytoplasm) to the transport system (in the membrane). Samples of TrwB fraction IV′-h were visualized by electron microscopy. Two preferred orientations of TrwB could be observed. The most abundant one can be defined as the side view (Fig. 4, upper panel A), and the processing of 860 of such particles generated an average image (Fig. 4, lower panel A) that was similar, albeit to a different resolution, to the lateral projection of the atomic structure of the TrwBΔN70 (Fig. 4, lower panel B), a mutant in which the first 70 residues, putatively involved in forming the membrane pore, have been deleted (30Gomis-Rüth F.X.

Both projections shared similar features, an orange-shaped structure with a channel traversing its central part. An important difference between both structures resides nevertheless in an ∼25-Å-wide appendix located at the bottom of the wild-type TrwB, which can be correlated with the transmembrane region of the protein and was not present in the structure of TrwBΔN70. This region was not as well resolved as the major domain, and this may be due to the presence of detergent shielding its hydrophobic core. The wider amplitude of the bottom of the transmembrane domain (Fig. 4, lower panel A) may be due to its intrinsic flexibility, which generates a blurring of this region in the average image. The other preferred orientation of TrwB can be defined as the top view (Fig. 4, upper panel B). The average image of 530 of these particles (Fig. 4,lower panel C) revealed a structure similar to the projection of the atomic structure of the TrwBΔN70 mutant along its 6-fold axis (Fig. 4, lower panel D). This average image presents, as its atomic counterpart, a central channel and six masses surrounding it, which undoubtedly indicates that TrwB was purified as a hexamer.

The SMN protein is important in small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) assembly and interacts with snRNP proteins via arginine/glycine-rich domains. Recently, SMN was also found to interact with core protein components of the two major families of small nucleolar RNPs, fibrillarin and GAR1, suggesting that SMN may also function in the assembly of small nucleolar RNPs. Here we present results that indicate that the interaction of SMN with GAR1 is mediated by the Tudor domain of SMN. Single point mutations within the Tudor domain, including a spinal muscular atrophy patient mutation, impair the interaction of SMN with GAR1. Furthermore, we find that either of the two arginine/glycine-rich domains of GAR1 can provide for interaction with SMN, but removal of both results in loss of the interaction. Finally, we have found that unlike the interaction of SMN with the Sm snRNP proteins, interaction with GAR1 and fibrillarin is not enhanced by arginine dimethylation. Our results argue against post-translational arginine dimethylation as a general requirement for SMN recognition of proteins bearing arginine/glycine-rich domains.

The best established role of SMN, the protein implicated in spinal muscular atrophy, is in the assembly of small nuclear RNA (snRNA) 1The abbreviations used are: snRNA and snRNP, small nuclear RNA and ribonucleoprotein, respectively; snoRNA and snoRNP, small nucleolar RNA and ribonucleoprotein, respectively; SMA, spinal muscular atrophy; sDMA, symmetric dimethylarginine(s); aDMA, asymmetric dimethylarginine(s); SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine. 1The abbreviations used are: snRNA and snRNP, small nuclear RNA and ribonucleoprotein, respectively; snoRNA and snoRNP, small nucleolar RNA and ribonucleoprotein, respectively; SMA, spinal muscular atrophy; sDMA, symmetric dimethylarginine(s); aDMA, asymmetric dimethylarginine(s); SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine.-protein complexes that function in pre-mRNA splicing. SMN interacts with the common snRNP proteins Sm B/B′, D1 and D3, and LSm 4 through arginine/glycine (RG)-rich domains present in these proteins (1Friesen W.J. Massenet S. Paushkin S. Wyce A.

Several studies have demonstrated that SMN and the other proteins of the SMN complex are required to facilitate the assembly of snRNPs and the generation of active spliceosomes (5Meister G. Buhler D.

Terns R.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R862-R864Google Scholar). In addition to the Sm and LSm snRNP proteins, SMN has been found to interact with RNA helicase A (13Pellizzoni L. Charroux B. Rappsilber J.

Most of these proteins contain a single RG-rich region that has been shown to be essential for association with SMN. GAR1 has two RG-rich domains, and interestingly, it has been reported that both of these are necessary for interaction (18Pellizzoni L. Baccon J. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1079-1088Google Scholar). Current evidence supports two different models for the basis of the interaction of SMN with partner proteins. One series of studies indicates that sequences near the carboxyl terminus of SMN mediate the interactions (including the interaction with GAR1) (2Friesen W.J. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26370-26375Google Scholar, 11Pellizzoni L. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11167-11172Google Scholar, 13Pellizzoni L. Charroux B. Rappsilber J.

Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1079-1088Google Scholar). This domain of SMN is important for the oligomerization of SMN (11Pellizzoni L. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11167-11172Google Scholar, 19Young P.J. Man N. Lorson C.L. Le T.T. Androphy E.J. Burghes A.H. Morris G.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2869-2877Google Scholar, 20Lorson C.L.

Other laboratories have implicated the Tudor domain of SMN in its interaction with some of the same RG domain proteins (3Brahms H. Meheus L. de Brabandere V. Fischer U. Luhrmann R. RNA. 2001; 7: 1531-1542Google Scholar, 4Selenko P. Sprangers R. Stier G. Buhler D. Fischer U. Sattler M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 27-31Google Scholar, 7Buhler D. Raker V. Luhrmann R. Fischer U.

Badbanchi F. Terns R.M. Terns M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38645-38651Google Scholar). Tudor domains, which have been found in several proteins (21Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 51-52Google Scholar), have been proposed to play a role in protein-protein interaction (4Selenko P. Sprangers R. Stier G. Buhler D. Fischer U. Sattler M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 27-31Google Scholar). Each of the models suggests that SMN interacts with multiple different proteins via a similar mechanism but differs in the domain of SMN that mediates the interactions. Based on the common features of the interactions, it has been proposed that SMN may be involved in the assembly of transcription complexes and snoRNPs as well as snRNPs (reviewed in Ref. 12Terns M.P. Terns R.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R862-R864Google Scholar).An additional determinant in the interaction of SMN with snRNP components is the methylation state of the target proteins. Arginines within the RG-rich domains of the Sm and LSm (“likeSm”) proteins are post-translationally methylated (3Brahms H. Meheus L. de Brabandere V. Fischer U. Luhrmann R. RNA. 2001; 7: 1531-1542Google Scholar,22Brahms H. Raymackers J. Union A. de Keyser F. Meheus L. Luhrmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17122-17129Google Scholar). The symmetric dimethylarginines (sDMA) that occur in Sm B/B′, D1 and D3, and Lsm 4 have been demonstrated to strengthen the binding of SMN (1Friesen W.J. Massenet S. Paushkin S. Wyce A. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1111-1117Google Scholar, 3Brahms H. Meheus L. de Brabandere V. Fischer U. Luhrmann R. RNA. 2001; 7: 1531-1542Google Scholar). A logical hypothesis is that methylation within the RG-rich domains of other target proteins would also enhance SMN binding (1Friesen W.J. Massenet S. Paushkin S. Wyce A. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1111-1117Google Scholar). However, unlike the Sm proteins, most SMN target proteins including fibrillarin (23Christensen M.E. Fuxa K.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 155: 1278-1283Google Scholar, 24Lischwe M.A. Ochs R.L. Reddy R. Cook R.G. Yeoman L.C. Tan E.M. Reichlin M. Busch H. J. Biol.

It is not known whether dimethylation influences the binding of SMN to these other target proteins.GAR1, the primary focus of the studies presented here, is a conserved nucleolar protein that is specifically associated with Box H/ACA family small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) (30Henras A.

The Box H/ACA snoRNAs direct site-specific pseudouridylation and processing of rRNA (34Mishra R.K. Eliceiri G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4972-4977Google Scholar, 35Ni J. Tien A.L.

GAR1, along with NHP2, NOP10, and dyskerin (Cbf5p in yeast) comprise a group of core proteins associated with all Box H/ACA snoRNAs (32Watkins N.J. Gottschalk A. Neubauer G. Kastner B. Fabrizio P. Mann M. Luhrmann R. RNA. 1998; 4: 1549-1568Google Scholar, 37Henras A. Henry Y. Bousquet-Antonelli C. Noaillac-Depeyre J. Gelugne J.P. Caizergues-Ferrer M.

The specific role of GAR1 in Box H/ACA snoRNP function is not yet known. GAR1 is so named because of the presence of two RG-rich (GAR) domains: one at each its amino and carboxyl termini. Studies in yeast indicate that GAR1 is a substrate for asymmetric arginine dimethylation (25Frankel A. Clarke S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 391-400Google Scholar).Here we present evidence that SMN interacts directly and specifically with GAR1. The SMN/GAR1 interaction is mediated by the Tudor domain of SMN and requires only one of the two RG-rich domains found in GAR1. Furthermore, we show that single missense mutations in the Tudor domain of SMN, including a mutation isolated from an SMA patient (E134K), have a negative effect on the ability of SMN to bind GAR1 in vitro. The panel of Tudor domain mutations affected the binding of GAR1 and Sm proteins in a similar manner, suggesting that similar contacts are made in the binding of SMN to the snoRNP and snRNP proteins. In addition, we have tested the role of arginine dimethylation on the interaction of SMN with both fibrillarin and GAR1. Our results indicate that whereas methylation of snRNP proteins facilitates SMN binding, and whereas snoRNP proteins are also substrates for methylation, arginine dimethylation is not a key determinant in the interaction of SMN with fibrillarin and GAR1. These findings indicate that dimethylation of arginine may only play a role in the interaction of SMN with a subset of its RG-rich target proteins and reveal an interesting difference between the interactions of SMN with snRNPs and snoRNPs, which otherwise appear to occur via similar mechanisms.DISCUSSIONSpinal muscular atrophy, one of the leading hereditary causes of infant mortality, results from mutation or deletion of the SMN1 gene and a reduction in the levels of functional SMN (41Lefebvre S.

Caizergues-Ferrer M. Henry Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 598-603Google Scholar)). SMN directly interacts with the core snoRNP proteins GAR1 and fibrillarin in vitro and in vivo (see Refs. 17Jones K.W. Gorzynski K. Hales C.M. Fischer U. Badbanchi F. Terns R.M. Terns M.P. J. Biol.

Moreover, SMN appears to interact with the snRNP and snoRNP complexes via a similar mechanism that involves the RG-rich domains of the target proteins and either the Tudor domain or COOH-terminal sequences of SMN (reviewed in Ref. 12Terns M.P.

Terns R.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R862-R864Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the determinants of this key interaction. We have demonstrated that the centrally located Tudor domain of SMN is necessary and sufficient for interaction with GAR1 (Figs. 2 and 3). Previous studies by us and others indicated that the Tudor domain is also the primary binding site for fibrillarin (17Jones K.W. Gorzynski K. Hales C.M. Fischer U. Badbanchi F. Terns R.M. Terns M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38645-38651Google Scholar) and snRNP proteins (3Brahms H. Meheus L. de Brabandere V. Fischer U. Luhrmann R. RNA. 2001; 7: 1531-1542Google Scholar, 4Selenko P. Sprangers R.

In contrast, investigations from another laboratory suggest that amino acids at the C terminus of SMN are essential for binding to these same proteins (2Friesen W.J. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26370-26375Google Scholar, 18Pellizzoni L. Baccon J. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1079-1088Google Scholar). We did not find a significant effect of the deletion of the C terminus of SMN (residues 1–278 or SMNΔEx7) or of the Y272C point mutation on interaction with GAR1, fibrillarin, or Sm B in this study (Fig. 2C) even with the assay conditions described in the previous work (see “Experimental Procedures”; data not shown). Among known SMN target proteins, GAR1 is unique in having two RG-rich domains, and we have shown that either domain can mediate interaction with SMN (Fig. 4). This observation is consistent with the fact that SMN interacts with multiple proteins that contain a single RG domain (2Friesen W.J. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26370-26375Google Scholar, 4Selenko P. Sprangers R. Stier G. Buhler D. Fischer U. Sattler M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 27-31Google Scholar, 11Pellizzoni L. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G.

Biol. 2001; 11: 1079-1088Google Scholar) but again contrasts with a recent report indicating that both of the RG domains of the GAR1 protein are necessary for SMN binding (18Pellizzoni L. Baccon J. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1079-1088Google Scholar). The basis of the differences observed within the field remains to be determined.For over 30 years, it has been known that arginines of RG-rich protein domains are subject to post-translational dimethylation in eukaryotes (28McBride A.E. Silver P.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 5-8Google Scholar, 29Gary J.D. Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 65-131Google Scholar). A family of protein arginine methyltransferases catalyzes the transfer of one, or more commonly two, methyl groups fromS-adenosylmethionine to the side chain (guanidino) nitrogen of arginine. Most PRMT family members, referred to as type I enzymes and including PRMT1, generate aDMA (63Tang J. Kao P.N. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19866-19876Google Scholar). Asymmetric arginine dimethylation is believed to be the most common arginine methylation of cellular proteins, and PRMT1 (Hmt1/Rmt1 in yeast) appears to execute most of these modifications (28McBride A.E. Silver P.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 5-8Google Scholar, 29Gary J.D. Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 65-131Google Scholar, 63Tang J. Kao P.N. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

PRMT1 is localized primarily in the nucleus (65Tang J. Gary J.D. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16935-16945Google Scholar). Proteins known to contain aDMA include nucleolin (66Lischwe M.A. Cook R.G. Ahn Y.S. Yeoman L.C. Busch H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6025-6028Google Scholar), poly(A)-binding proteins (67Smith J.J.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3668-3678Google Scholar, 27Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2800-2808Google Scholar, 69Green D.M. Marfatia K.A. Crafton E.B. Zhang X. Cheng X. Corbett A.H. J.

Clarke S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 391-400Google Scholar) and fibrillarin (23Christensen M.E. Fuxa K.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 155: 1278-1283Google Scholar, 66Lischwe M.A. Cook R.G. Ahn Y.S. Yeoman L.C. Busch H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6025-6028Google Scholar). Thus far, PRMT5 (JBP1) (71Branscombe T.L. Frankel A. Lee J.H. Cook J.R. Yang Z. Pestka S. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32971-32976Google Scholar), which has been shown to add sDMA to RG-rich substrates including a subset of Sm and LSm snRNP proteins (22Brahms H. Raymackers J. Union A. de Keyser F. Meheus L. Luhrmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17122-17129Google Scholar) and the myelin basic protein (72Baldwin G.S. Carnegie P.R. Science. 1971; 171: 579-581Google Scholar), is the only class II enzyme that has been identified. PRMT5 functions in the cytoplasm (as a component of the “methylosome”) to symmetrically dimethylate snRNP proteins (44Meister G. Eggert C. Buhler D. Brahms H. Kambach C. Fischer U. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1990-1994Google Scholar, 73Friesen W.J. Paushkin S. Wyce A. Massenet S. Pesiridis G.S. Van Duyne G. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8289-8300Google Scholar).SMN interacts both with proteins that contain sDMA (e.g. Sm and LSm snRNP proteins) and aDMA (e.g. fibrillarin, GAR1, and heterogeneous RNP proteins). Recent studies have shown that binding of SMN to Sm and LSm snRNP proteins is greatly enhanced by symmetric dimethylation of the proteins (1Friesen W.J. Massenet S. Paushkin S. Wyce A. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1111-1117Google Scholar, 3Brahms H. Meheus L. de Brabandere V. Fischer U. Luhrmann R. RNA. 2001; 7: 1531-1542Google Scholar). Accordingly, it was thought that dimethylarginine may promote interaction of SMN with the full array of its RG-rich target proteins (1Friesen W.J. Massenet S. Paushkin S. Wyce A. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1111-1117Google Scholar). However, our results indicate that post-translational arginine methylation, which is believed to be an irreversible protein modification, is not a general requirement for substrate recognition by SMN. Whereas we also observed the substantial enhancement in SMN binding with methylation of SmB (Fig. 5; see Refs. 1Friesen W.J. Massenet S. Paushkin S. Wyce A. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1111-1117Google Scholar and 3Brahms H. Meheus L. de Brabandere V. Fischer U. Luhrmann R. RNA. 2001; 7: 1531-1542Google Scholar), we did not detect any comparable effect of methylation on GAR1 or fibrillarin (Figs. 5 and 6).A number of possibilities can be envisioned to explain why methylation plays a critical role in the recognition of the Sm and LSm (sDMA-containing) proteins but not GAR1 and fibrillarin (aDMA-containing) proteins by SMN. SMN may recognize the differences between the symmetric and asymmetric dimethylarginines. sDMA and aDMA are structurally very similar, and both modifications add hydrophobic character and bulk but do not alter the net positive charge of the arginine. The key difference between the sDMA and aDMA is the distribution of the added methyl groups (a single methyl group added to both terminal nitrogens versus two methyl groups added to a single terminal nitrogen, respectively). Alternatively, enhancement of SMN binding by methylation may only be observed in the context of intrinsically weaker interactions. Conceivably, SMN has a greater affinity for unmodified GAR1 and fibrillarin (due perhaps to another feature such as the regularly spaced phenylalanine residues found in the RG domains of GAR1 and fibrillarin), which is not further enhanced by the addition of methyl groups. Taking this view, methylation of the RG-rich domains of the Sm and LSm proteins may be a requirement for SMN interaction because the unmodified forms of these proteins may have a lower affinity for SMN. Finally, it is possible that small changes in affinity that were not detected in vitro are significantin vivo. Detailed structural studies examining the amino acid contacts between SMN and a number of its substrates in their methylated and unmethylated states should help address this important issue.Whereas our work suggests that methylation is not a critical determinant for association with SMN, arginine dimethylation may influence other important aspects of the biogenesis or function of GAR1 and fibrillarin. RG domains have been proposed to be important for a variety of functions including nucleic acid (RNA) interaction, protein/protein interaction, and intracellular transport and subcellular localization (28McBride A.E. Silver P.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 5-8Google Scholar, 29Gary J.D. Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 65-131Google Scholar). In particular, there is evidence to indicate that the RG-rich domain of fibrillarin is important for localization of fibrillarin to the nucleolus (74Snaar S. Wiesmeijer K. Jochemsen A.G. Tanke H.J. Dirks R.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 653-662Google Scholar) and that the RG-rich domains of GAR1 play an auxiliary role in snoRNA binding (75Bagni C. Lapeyre B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10868-10873Google Schola"
https://openalex.org/W1978007602,"The small GTPase Rac1 has been implicated in regulation of cell migration and cell-cell adhesion in epithelial cells. Little is known, however, about the spatial and temporal coordination of Rac1 activity required to balance these competing processes. We fractionated endogenous Rac1-containing protein complexes from membranes of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and identified three major complexes comprising a Rac1·PAK (p21-activated kinase) complex, and 11 S and 16 S Rac1 complexes. Significantly, Rac1 shifts from the 11 S to a 16 S particle during initiation of cell-cell adhesion. This shift may reflect a diffusion trapping mechanism by which these Rac1 complexes are localized to cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts through an interaction with annexin II."
https://openalex.org/W2070815784,"Nucleosome structure and repair ofN-methylpurines were analyzed at nucleotide resolution in the divergent GAL1-10 genes of intact yeast cells, encompassing their common upstream-activating sequence. In glucose cultures where genes are repressed, nucleosomes with fixed positions exist in regions adjacent to the upstream-activating sequence, and the variability of nucleosome positioning sharply increases with increasing distance from this sequence. Galactose induction causes nucleosome disruption throughout the region analyzed, with those nucleosomes close to the upstream-activating sequence being most striking. In glucose cultures, a strong correlation between N-methylpurine repair and nucleosome positioning was seen in nucleosomes with fixed positions, where slow and fast repair occurred in nucleosome core and linker DNA, respectively. Galactose induction enhancedN-methylpurine repair in both strands of nucleosome core DNA, being most dramatic in the clearly disrupted, fixed nucleosomes. Furthermore, N-methylpurines are repaired primarily by the Mag1-initiated base excision repair pathway, and nucleotide excision repair contributes little to repair of these lesions. Finally,N-methylpurine repair is significantly affected by nearest-neighbor nucleotides, where fast and slow repair occurred in sites between pyrimidines and purines, respectively.

Simple methylating agents, such as methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) 1The abbreviations used are: MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; BER, base excision repair; BLM, bleomycin; DMS, dimethyl sulfate; 3MeA, N 3-methyladenine; 7MeG, N 7-methylguanine; NER, nucleotide excision repair; NMP, N-methylpurine; TS, transcribed strand; NTS, nontranscribed strand; UAS, upstream-activating sequence1The abbreviations used are: MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; BER, base excision repair; BLM, bleomycin; DMS, dimethyl sulfate; 3MeA, N 3-methyladenine; 7MeG, N 7-methylguanine; NER, nucleotide excision repair; NMP, N-methylpurine; TS, transcribed strand; NTS, nontranscribed strand; UAS, upstream-activating sequence and dimethyl sulfate (DMS), produce a variety of damaged bases in DNA of whichN7-methylguanine (7MeG) andN3-methyladenine (3MeA) constitute ∼80 and 10%, respectively (1Singer B.

DNA Damage and Repair, Vol. 2: DNA Repair in higher eukaryotes. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1998: 199-222Google Scholar). These N-methylpurines (NMPs), can be enzymatically removed or they can spontaneously depurinate to produce abasic sites, which may be more mutagenic than NMPs (3Posnick L.M. Samson L.D. Mutat. Res. 1999; 257: 127-143Google Scholar, 4Xiao W. Chow B.L. Hanna M. Doetsch P.W. Mutat. Res. 2001; 487: 137-147Google Scholar). Some DNA lesions that are repaired by nucleotide excision repair (NER) or certain base excision repair (BER) pathways are removed much faster in the transcribed strand (TS) than in the nontranscribed strand (NTS) of an active gene (5Hanawalt P.C. Mutat. Res. 2001; 485: 3-13Google Scholar). In contrast, repair of NMPs does not appear to be coupled to transcription, since the TS and NTS have similar repair rates in the genes analyzed to date (6Scicchitano D.A. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3050-3054Google Scholar, 7Ye N. Holmquist G.P. O'Connor T.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 269-285Google Scholar, 8Li S. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12201-12204Google Scholar). However, repair rates of NMPs vary dramatically at different sites in both the humanPGK1 gene (7Ye N. Holmquist G.P. O'Connor T.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 269-285Google Scholar) and the yeast minichromosome YRpSO1 (8Li S. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12201-12204Google Scholar). One reason for this repair heterogeneity is the effect of nearest-neighbor nucleotides (8Li S. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12201-12204Google Scholar), in that slow repair occurs at NMPs between purines and fast repair occurs at NMPs between pyrimidines. It was proposed that different stabilities of base stacking between adjacent base pairs can affect flipping out of NMPs from the DNA helix during recognition and incision by DNA glycosylase (8Li S. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12201-12204Google Scholar). In the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, DNA is packaged into a nucleoprotein complex known as chromatin (9Wolffe A.P. Chromatin: Structure and Function. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, London, and New York1999: 7-172Google Scholar). This complex provides the compaction and structural organization of DNA for processes such as replication, transcription, recombination, and repair. The fundamental subunits of chromatin are nucleosome cores, where 147 bp of DNA is wrapped around a histone octamer (10Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Google Scholar). DNA between two adjacent nucleosome cores is called linker DNA, which varies in length from about 20 to 90 bp in different organisms and tissues, or between individual nucleosomes in the same cell (11van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag KG, Berlin1989: 289-354Google Scholar). The effect of nucleosome structure on NMP repair is not understood. In rat liver cells, it was shown that the overall removal of NMPs occurred at a relatively uniform rate in different chromatin fractions (i.e. active chromatin, bulk genome and nuclear matrix) (12Ryan A.J. Billett M.A. O'Connor P.J. Carcinogenesis. 1986; 7: 1497-1503Google Scholar). On the other hand, within the yeast minichromosome YRpSO1, there was a mild correlation between repair rates and nucleosome positioning in regions of the inducible GAL1:URA3 fusion gene, but not in the constitutively expressed HIS3 gene on the same plasmid (8Li S. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12201-12204Google Scholar). To further address questions on the effect of nucleosome structure on repair of NMPs in intact cells, we examined repair in the divergent yeast GAL1-10 genes, which share a common upstream-activating sequence (UAS). These genes are induced to very high levels of expression in galactose, but are completely repressed in glucose (13Bash R. Lohr D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 65: 197-259Google Scholar). Extensive studies have been done on isolated nuclei or chromatin to map the nucleosome structure in the GAL1-10region and the effects of galactose induction (14Lohr D. Torchia T. Hopper J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15589-15597Google Scholar, 15Fedor M.J. Lue N.F. Kornberg R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 109-127Google Scholar, 16Fedor M.J. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1721-1732Google Scholar, 17Cavalli G. Thoma F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4603-4613Google Scholar). However, it is possible that subtle changes in nucleosome structure of this region differ in whole cells, and were missed because of the procedure of nuclei and/or chromatin isolation. Thus, to examine the influence of nucleosome structure on repair of NMPs in intact cells, we developed a nucleosome mapping procedure using bleomycin (BLM), which avoids isolation of nuclei or chromatin. This basic glycopeptide-derived antibiotic has been shown to preferentially cleave nucleosome linker DNA in isolated Chinese hamster nuclei (18Kuo M.T. Hsu T.C. Nature. 1978; 271: 83-84Google Scholar), lysophosphatidylcholine-permeabilized human cells (19Sidik K. Smerdon M.J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1613-1619Google Scholar), and whole yeast cells (20Moore C.W. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 6837-6843Google Scholar). However, BLM has not been used to map nucleosome positions in specific sequences in whole cells, since highly specific cleavage in linker DNA has not been achieved. By using the mild nonionic detergent digitonin to efficiently permeabilize yeast cells, and rich medium to effectively stop BLM cleavage during DNA isolation, we were able to map nucleosome structure at nucleotide resolution in the GAL1-10region in whole yeast cells and directly correlate repair of NMPs with nucleosome structure. DBY747 (MATa ura3-52his3-Δ1 leu2–3 leu2–112 trp1–289) and its isogenic mutant strains JC8901 (mag1Δ::hisG- URA3-hisG), WXY9379 (rad1Δ::LEU2), and WXY9380 (mag1Δ::hisG- URA3-hisG rad1Δ::LEU2) were generously provided by Dr. Wei Xiao (University of Saskatchewan, Canada). Strain Y452 (MATα ura3-52 his3–1 leu2–3 leu2–112) was provided by Dr. Louise Prakash (University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX). Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C in minimal medium containing 2% glucose or 2% galactose to late-log phase (OD600 ∼1.0). After washing twice with ice-cold 2% glucose (for glucose cultures) or 2% galactose (for galactose cultures), the cells were resuspended in 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.02% glucose or galactose, to give a cell density of 2 × 109cells/ml. Digitonin (Sigma, 10% stock) and Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 (10 mm, freshly dissolved in H2O) were mixed with the cell suspension to give a final concentration of 0.05% and 50 μm, respectively. BLM (Sigma, 20 units/ml stock) was then added to final concentrations of 0–400 milliunits/ml, and the mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 12 min. To stop the reaction, the cell suspension was mixed with 100 volumes of ice-cold YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) or YPG (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% galactose) and pelleted by centrifugation. For the second wash, cells were resuspended in ice-cold 2% glucose or 2% galactose, mixed with 1:10 volume of a stock solution containing 10% yeast extract and 20% peptone, and pelleted by centrifugation. It has been shown that BLM associates with outer plasma membranes of mammalian cells (CV-1), and can cleave DNA after the cells are lysed, even in the presence of EDTA (21Solomon L.R. Beerelli R.D. Moseley P.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9932-9937Google Scholar). Furthermore, BLM molecules can only be efficiently removed from mammalian cell membranes by trypsin treatment (21Solomon L.R. Beerelli R.D. Moseley P.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9932-9937Google Scholar). We found BLM can be efficiently removed after treatment, simply by washing the cells with media containing yeast extract and peptone. The naked DNA used in these experiments was a PCR fragment of the yeastGAL1-10 region. Reactions (50 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 ng of a PCR product, 1 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA, 1–5 μm of freshly prepared Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 and 0–5 milliunits/ml of BLM. After 12 min of incubation at 30 °C, the DNA was quickly separated from the reaction mixture with the QIAquick Nucleotide Removal Kit (Qiagen). Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C in minimal medium containing 2% glucose or 2% galactose to late log phase (OD600 ∼1.0), and mixed with DMS (Sigma, undiluted solution) to give a final concentration of 0.03% (v/v). After 2 min incubation at room temperature, cells were washed twice with ice-cold 2% glucose (or 2% galactose) and resuspended in the same solutions containing 100 mmhydroxyurea, to prevent DNA replication during repair incubation (22Slater M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 113: 263-270Google Scholar). One-tenth volume of a solution containing 10% yeast extract and 20% peptone was added to the DMS-treated cultures. After different times of repair incubation at 30 °C, an aliquot was removed and put on ice. After BLM treatment or repair incubation following DMS treatment, pellets of 2 × 109 cells, were mixed with 2 ml of ice-cold nuclei isolation buffer (NIB: 50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 17% glycerol, 0.5 mm spermine, 0.15 mm spermidine, pH8.0) and 2 ml of acid-washed glass beads (Sigma, 425–600 microns). The mixtures were vortexed for 30 s and kept on ice for 2–5 min. This procedure was repeated three times to completely break up the cells. The samples were mixed with 10 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 400 mm NaCl, 2% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and incubated at 65 °C for over 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the samples were mixed with 8 ml of 5 m NaCl and left on ice overnight. The samples were then centrifuged at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. The DNA was precipitated, treated with RNase A, and extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). After re-precipitation, the DNA was dissolved in H2O and stored at −20 °C before using. The sites of BLM cleavage and NMPs were mapped along a 1.9-kb region encompassing the common UAS and 5′-portion of the GAL1 and GAL10genes. Five overlapping restriction fragments (four of these fragments are shown in Figs. 1 and 2) on each strand of the region were end-labeled using the procedure described previously (23Li S. Waters R. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 1549-1552Google Scholar, 24Li S. Waters R. Smerdon M.J. Methods: Companion Methods Enzymol. 2000; 22: 170-179Google Scholar), with slight modification. Briefly, about 2–3 μg of genomic DNA was digested with restriction endonuclease(s) to release the fragments of interest. For NMP mapping, the restricted DNA was further cleaved at the NMP sites by incubating DNA in 1 m piperidine at 90 °C for 30 min, and the piperidine removed by evaporation (8Li S. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12201-12204Google Scholar). Excess copies of a biotinylated oligonucleotide, which has a portion complementary to one end of the fragment to be labeled, were mixed with the sample. The T tract in the biotinylated oligonucleotides described formerly (23Li S. Waters R. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 1549-1552Google Scholar, 24Li S. Waters R. Smerdon M.J. Methods: Companion Methods Enzymol. 2000; 22: 170-179Google Scholar) was changed to short runs (4Xiao W. Chow B.L. Hanna M. Doetsch P.W. Mutat. Res. 2001; 487: 137-147Google Scholar, 5Hanawalt P.C. Mutat. Res. 2001; 485: 3-13Google Scholar) of Ts separated by Gs. This change ensured full-length incorporation of radioactive dAMPs opposite the Ts, and eliminated hybridization between the oligonucleotides and contaminating poly(A) tails of mRNA. The mixture was heated to 95 °C for 5 min to denature the DNA and then cooled to an annealing temperature. The annealed fragments were attached to streptavidin magnetic beads (Dynal), and the other fragments were removed by washing the beads at the annealing temperature. The attached fragments were labeled using [α-32P]dATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and non-radioactive dCTP, rather than [α-32P]dATP alone (23Li S. Waters R. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 1549-1552Google Scholar, 24Li S. Waters R. Smerdon M.J. Methods: Companion Methods Enzymol. 2000; 22: 170-179Google Scholar). The labeled fragments were resolved on sequencing gels and exposed to PhosphorImager screens (Molecular Dynamics).Figure 2Bleomycin cleavage of the bottom strand of the GAL1-10 region ( NTS for GAL10 and TS for GAL1). Panels are of sequencing gels for four of five overlapping restriction fragments analyzed along a 1.9-kb region of the GAL1-10 genes. See legend to Fig. 1for details.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Sequence ladders were generated from PCR products of theGAL1-10 fragments, using the rapid Maxam-Gilbert method (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.1989: 13.95-13.97Google Scholar). The ladders were labeled using the same procedure as that for the BLM or DMS treated DNA samples. The BLM cleavage at individual sites is reflected by the band intensity on a gel. The doses of BLM used were relatively low, to ensure that cleavage by BLM followed single-hit kinetics for the majority of fragments analyzed. However, even under these conditions, a small portion of the fragments still have more than one cleavage, and a small portion of the signal at a site will not show up on a gel if the cleavage occurs upstream (relative to the labeled end) of the site. The effect of this “hidden signal” increases as a cleave site is more distant from the labeled 3′-end, which runs at the bottom of a gel. For a fragment of ≈400 nucleotides (i.e. the maximum length quantified on the sequencing gels), the hidden signal at a site close to the top of a gel can be as much as 30% of the total signal in a band. To correct for this, the following algorithm was used: Let A denote the total signal intensity in a gel lane, X the actual signal intensity (i.e. not reduced by upstream cleavages) at position N in a gel lane, and C the total signal intensity upstream of position N (the upstream sites run below position N in a gel lane). The proportion of signal intensity at position N is X/A and the proportion of signal intensity upstream of position N is C/A. Suppose BLM cleavage at specific sites is randomly distributed among different fragments (i.e. follow a Poisson distribution), then the probability of cleavages at position N and those upstream of position N on the same fragments is (X/A) × (C/A). Therefore, the total number of cleavages at position N and those upstream of position N on the same fragment is A × [(X/A) × (C/A)], or (X × C)/A. If B denotes the observed signal intensity at position N on the gel, then (X × C)/A = X − B and the actual signal intensity (X) at position N is (A × B)/(A − C). The signal intensity at all pixels in a gel lane was measured by ImageQuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics) and the data transferred to Microsoft Excel. After the gel background signal was subtracted, the total signal intensities in different lanes of a gel were normalized to the same amount. The signal intensity at all pixels along a gel lane (including the control lanes not cleaved with BLM) was then corrected using the above described equation X = (A × B)/(A − C). The signal intensities in a lane containing the uncleaved sample were used as a baseline for other lanes that contain BLM cleaved samples. As the signal intensities along a gel lane of uncleaved sample fluctuate, the baseline was smoothed by local averaging of signal intensities (at continuous intervals of 100–200 pixels) in the lane. The corrected signal intensities in a lane containing BLM cleaved sample were then corrected by subtraction of the smoothed baseline. The data was then imported to PeakFit (SPSS, Inc.) to fit and deconvolute peaks corresponding to the individual bands on the gels (24Li S. Waters R. Smerdon M.J. Methods: Companion Methods Enzymol. 2000; 22: 170-179Google Scholar). Quantitation for NMPs followed the same procedure as that for BLM cleavage. Wild type (Y452) yeast cells were grown in glucose or galactose medium, permeabilized with digitonin and treated with BLM. The time used for digitonin permeabilization and BLM treatment was 12 min, which is just long enough to see noticeable BLM cleavage in chromatin DNA. Under these conditions, different concentrations of BLM showed a linear response of band intensity (Figs. 1 and2 and data not shown). Therefore, the cleavage by BLM followed single-hit kinetics for the majority of the chromatin DNA fragments. Genomic DNA was isolated from the BLM-treated cells and cut with restriction enzyme to release the fragments of interest. A total of 5 overlapping restriction fragments were analyzed for each strand of theGAL1-10 region. The restricted fragments were strand-specifically end-labeled, resolved on DNA sequencing gels, and exposed to phosphorimager screens. For comparison, naked DNA of the same GAL1-10 region was also treated in parallel with the chromatin DNA. As can be seen from the gels in Figs. 1 and 2, naked DNA was cleaved at very low concentrations of BLM (5 milliunits/ml) and Fe2+ (1 μm), and no cleavage was observed in the presence of BLM or Fe2+ alone (lanes 1 and2 in Figs. 1 and 2; data not shown). Almost all pyrimidines 3′ to guanines are cleaved by BLM (compare lanes 2 in each gel with the sequencing lanes C+T and G) consistent with previous reports (26D'Andrea A.D. Haseltine W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3608-3612Google Scholar). Most adenines 3′ to guanines are also cleaved, but generally to a lesser extent (Figs. 1 and 2,arrowheads to the right of gels). Furthermore, some sites of weak cleavage are also observed at pyrimidines 3′ to adenines (Figs. 1 and 2, small horizontal bars on theright side of gels). Much higher concentrations of BLM and Fe2+ are needed for cleavage of chromatin DNA in permeabilized cells to reach the same level as that for naked DNA (Figs. 1 and 2). Furthermore, there was consistently more cleavage of chromatin DNA in glucose cultures than in galactose cultures, when the same concentration of BLM was applied (Figs. 1 and 2; data not shown). Most likely, BLM is hydrolyzed more rapidly in galactose cultures due to the induction of BLM hydrolase, which is encoded by the GAL6 gene (27Zheng W., Xu, H.E. Johnston S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30350-30355Google Scholar). To determine the protection level of a nucleosome to its DNA, the ratios of band intensities for BLM cleavage of naked DNA to chromatin DNA (in glucose and galactose cultures) were determined from scans of phosphorimages and peak deconvolution (24Li S. Waters R. Smerdon M.J. Methods: Companion Methods Enzymol. 2000; 22: 170-179Google Scholar). This ratio was designated as 1.0 at a BLM cleavage site (nucleotide 1003 relative to the uniqueStuI site in the GAL10 gene, Fig. 2 C) on the bottom strand near the UAS. The ratios at other cleavage sites were then normalized to the ratio at this site. The normalized ratios are plotted in Fig. 3 A for both glucose (open triangles) and galactose (solid triangles) grown cells, and the smoothed curves (by averaging values in continuous intervals of 40 nucleotides) for these values are plotted in Fig. 3 B. The BLM cleavage pattern at most sites in the UAS region is similar between chromatin (both glucose and galactose cultures) and naked DNA (Figs. 1 C and 2 C), suggesting the UAS region is nucleosome-free in both glucose and galactose cultures. This is in agreement with DNase I (28Lohr D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 8457-8474Google Scholar) and (methiumpropyl−EDTA)iron(II) (16Fedor M.J. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1721-1732Google Scholar) mapping in isolated nuclei. However, a few sites in the UAS region do show inhibition or enhancement of BLM cleavage (Figs. 1 C and 2 C, UAS region), indicating the binding of nonhistone protein(s), most notably Gal4, to this region may modulate BLM cleavage. In glucose cultures, where the genes are repressed, a region of about 150 bp on each side of the UAS is strongly protected from BLM cleavage (Figs. 1, B and C; 2, B andC; and 3, see regions marked by ovals e andf), indicating that each of these regions contains a nucleosome with a fixed position on DNA. The protection of flanking ∼150 bp regions (Figs. 1-3, ovals d and g) is less apparent, and the protection diminishes with increasing distance from the UAS (qualitatively represented by the shading of ovals in Figs. 1-3). Indeed, the protection levels can be 10-fold greater in the core regions of nucleosomes e and f (Figs.1-3), which are adjacent to the UAS, than those of nucleosomesa, b, c, h, andi, which are farther away from the UAS. These results indicate that the variability of nucleosome positions sharply increases with increasing distance from the UAS in intact cells. In galactose cultures, where GAL1-10 genes are induced, all the nucleosome core sequences in the GAL1-10 region analyzed are less protected from BLM cleavage (Figs. 1-3), indicating nucleosomes are disrupted upon galactose induction. This disruption is most striking in nucleosomes e and f, which are adjacent to the UAS, presumably due to their occupying the minimum number of positions in glucose cultures (Figs. 1-3). The same wild type (Y452) yeast cells as those used for nucleosome mapping were used for analyzing NMP induction and repair in the GAL1-10 region. The cells were treated with 0.03% DMS for 2 min to induce NMPs (see “Experimental Procedures”). After different times of repair incubation, genomic DNA was isolated, digested with restriction enzymes, and cleaved at NMPs by hot alkaline treatment. The cleaved fragments were strand-specifically end-labeled, resolved on DNA sequencing gels and exposed to phosphorimager screens. As can be seen from the gels in Figs. 4 and5, the main type of NMPs induced is 7MeG (e.g. compare 0-h lanes with G lanes), while 3MeA is induced to a much lower extent (e.g. compare0 h lanes with G and GA lanes). This pattern of NMP induction is similar to that seen with the yeast minichromosome YRpSO1 (8Li S. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12201-12204Google Scholar) and to that of other past reports (2Pieper R.O. Nickoloff J.A. Hoekstra M.F. DNA Damage and Repair, Vol. 2: DNA Repair in higher eukaryotes. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1998: 199-222Google Scholar).Figure 5Induction and repair of NMPs in the bottom strand ( NTS for GAL10 and TS forGAL1) of the GAL1-10 region for glucose (Glu) and galactose (Gal) cultures. See the legend to Fig.4 for details.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In galactose cultures, a strong protection from DMS methylation is seen at Gs in the triplet sequences of CGG, AGG, or CGC located at both ends of the palindromic Gal4 binding sites (brackets in Figs. 4 Cand 5 C; Gs marked with arrowheads on theright side of gels), consistent with a previous report (29Giniger E. Varnum S.M. Ptashne M. Cell. 1985; 40: 767-774Google Scholar). Meanwhile, an enhancement of methylation can also be seen in some sites of the UAS region, especially in the top strand (Figs. 4 Cand 5 C, small horizontal bars on the right side of gels). Moreover, there is a difference between glucose and galactose cultures in NMP yield at several sites in the promoter regions of the two genes (Figs. 4 B and 5 B, stars on the right side of gels). On the other hand, NMP yields at most sites throughout the region are similar between the two cultures (Figs. 4 and5), indicating that the presence of nucleosomes does not markedly affect NMP induction. This agrees with a previous in vitrostudy showing that formation of nucleosomes does not significantly modulate NMP induction by DMS (30McGhee J.D. Felsenfeld G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2133-2137Google Scholar). The repair rates of NMPs at different sites were dramatically different (>30-fold at sites) (Figs. 4-6). As can be seen from the gels in Figs. 4 and 5, most NMP sites located between pyrimidines (C or T) were repaired much faster than NMPs between purines (A or G), and those located between a purine and a pyrimidine were repaired at intermediate rates. In order to assess the generality of these observations, the percentages of 7MeGs remaining following different times of repair incubation in the same contexts of nearest-neighbor nucleotides (i.e. between purines, pyrimidines, and between a purine and a pyrimidine) were averaged. As can be seen from Fig. 7, the statistical data confirm these observations. As limited 3MeA sites were available for analysis, the effect of the nearest-neighbor nucleotides on 3MeA repair cannot be analyzed by this method.Figure 7Effect of nearest-neighbor nucleotides on repair of 7MeGs in the GAL1-10 genes of glucose (A) and galactose (B) cultures, respectively. The data in each panel represent the mean (± 1 S.D.) of the percent of 7MeGs remaining at all the sites that could be analyzed in the 1.9-kb region between purines (—⃝—, 122 sites), pyrimidines (—△—, 137 sites), and a purine and a pyrimidine (dashed line, 259 sites). The S.D. for the 7MeG sites between a purine and a pyrimidine are not included to more clearly show the difference of repair rates between the other two contexts of nearest-neighbor nucleotides.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In glucose cultures, the strongest correlation between nucleosome positioning and NMP repair can be seen in the two nucleosomes (e and f) with the most fixed positions (Figs. 4-6). In these regions, slow repair occurs in the nucleosome core DNA and faster repair takes place in nucleosome linker or nucleosome-free DNA (i.e. the UAS region). This correlation sharply fades off in the nucleosomes that are more distant from the UAS, in agreement with the observations that the variability of nucleosome positioning sharply increases with distance from the UAS. This profile of correlation can be seen more clearly after the individual times required for repairing 50% of the NMPs (T½) are smoothed (by locally averaging the values in continuous 40-nucleotide intervals) (Fig. 6 B). However, with the marked effects of nearest-neighbor nucleotides on NMP repair (see above) superimposed on the effects of nucleosome structure, the nucleosome effect is masked and more difficult to discern in the regions distant from the UAS. Galactose induction causes enhancement of repair in both strands of the nucleosome core DNA (Figs. 4-6). Indeed, increases of as much as 8-fold occur in the core regions of nucleosomes e andf, which are disrupted most dramatically (Fig.6 C). Interestingly, this galactose-enhancement of NMP repair also fades off with distance from the UAS (Fig. 6 C), correlating well with the nucleosome positioning and disruption trends (compare Figs. 3 B and 6 C). It has been shown thatmag1 mutants that are defective in NER (rad1 orrad2 mutants) are extremely sensitive to MMS-induced killing, and the effects of these mutations are synergistic (31Xiao W. Chow B.L. Curr. Genet. 1998; 33: 92-99Google Scholar). This suggests that NER may provide an alternative pathway for repair of NMPs. To assess the contribution of NER, repair of NMPs was analyzed in different genomic regions of isogenic wild type, mag1,rad1, and mag1 rad1 cells. As examples, NMP repair in regions of the GAL1 gene and the constitutively expressed RPB2 gene, which encodes the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, is shown in Fig.8. As can be seen, essentially normal repair occurred in rad1 cells. In contrast, deletion of theMAG1 gene almost completely abolishes repair of NMPs, although residual repair can be seen if the RAD1 gene is present in the mag1 cells (Fig. 8). Repair analysis in other genomic regions shows the same trends (data not shown), indicating NER plays little, if any, role in the repair of NMPs in S. cerevisiae. We have mapped nucleosome structure and repair ofN-methylpurines in whole yeast cells. The major nucleosome positions observed in this report agree well with past reports on isolated nuclei or chromatin (15Fedor M.J. Lue N.F. Kornberg R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 109-127Google Scholar, 16Fedor M.J. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1721-1732Google Scholar, 17Cavalli G. Thoma F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4603-4613Google Scholar). However, in the present study, nucleosomes that occupy fixed positions in the GAL1-10promoter region were only observed in the regions adjacent to the UAS in glucose cultures, and the variability of positions sharply increases with increasing distance from the UAS (Figs. 1-3). This observation fits well with the finding that the binding of Y factor to a short sequence that overlaps the Gal4 binding site II of the UAS serves as a nucleosome positioning boundary (15Fedor M.J. Lue N.F. Kornberg R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 109-127Google Scholar). In contrast, mapping with isolated nuclei or chromatin showed longer arrays of precisely positioned nucleosomes in the entire GAL1-10 region (15Fedor M.J. Lue N.F. Kornberg R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 109-127Google Scholar, 16Fedor M.J. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1721-1732Google Scholar, 17Cavalli G. Thoma F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4603-4613Google Scholar). This difference may reflect a selection for lowest energy nucleosome positions in chromatin during nuclei isolation, compared with more dynamic features of nucleosomes that are distant from the UAS in intact cells. This notion agrees well with the NMP repair data (Figs. 4-6), as well as results of nucleotide excision repair of ultraviolet light induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. 2S. Li and M. J. Smerdon, unpublished results. Our data strongly suggest that nucleosomes in intact cells inhibit NMP repair. First of all, in nucleosomes with fixed positions (especiallye and f), repair is much slower in the core DNA sequences than in linker DNA (Figs. 4-6). Secondly, induction of transcription enhanced NMP repair, with the regions close to the UAS (where nucleosome disruption is most dramatic) being most striking (Fig. 6 C). We note that, it is unlikely that this enhancement is caused by a direct coupling between transcription and repair, as no strand bias for repair is observed in these regions (Figs. 4-6). This enhancement, however, correlates well with nucleosome positioning and disruption profiles (compare Figs.3 B and 6 C). As multiple factors seem to influence repair of NMPs, nucleosome affected NMP repair may be obscured, especially in the more dynamic nucleosomes in the cell. In addition to the influence of nearest neighbor nucleotides (discussed below), the binding of nonhistone proteins may also affect NMP repair. Indeed, repair of NMPs in the UAS region was faster in glucose cultures than in galactose cultures, where the nonhistone protein Gal4 is bound to the UAS region (Figs. 4 C, 5 C, and 6). These considerations may explain why little or no correlation between NMP repair and nucleosome positioning is seen in regions distant from the UAS. In a previous report on NMP repair in the yeast minichromosome YRpSO1 (8Li S. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12201-12204Google Scholar), we observed a mild correlation between repair rates and nucleosome positioning in some regions of the GAL1:URA3fusion gene, but not in the HIS3 gene (8Li S. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12201-12204Google Scholar). Presumably, these observations reflect differences in dynamics of nucleosome positions in these genes on the minichromosome. NER and Mag1-initiated BER are synergistic in response to MMS-induced DNA lesions (31Xiao W. Chow B.L. Curr. Genet. 1998; 33: 92-99Google Scholar), indicating a subset of these lesions may be repaired by both pathways. Furthermore, in vitro experiments with purified human 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase (MPG protein), which is the counterpart of yeast Mag1, show that MPG interacts with the human homologue of Rad23 (hHR23) (32Miao F. Bouziane M. Dammann R. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Pfeifer G. O'Connor T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28433-28438Google Scholar). Importantly, this interaction elevates the rate of MPG-catalyzed excision from hypoxanthine-containing substrates (32Miao F. Bouziane M. Dammann R. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Pfeifer G. O'Connor T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28433-28438Google Scholar). Our results with mag1 and rad1mutant cells suggest that, in S. cerevisiae, repair of NMPs is accomplished primarily by the Mag1-initiated BER pathway, and that NER contributes very little to the repair of these lesions. We also analyzed NMP repair in mutants lacking Rad7, Rad16 and Rad23 proteins, each of which is a component of the NER pathway (33Prakash S. Prakash L. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 13-24Google Scholar). None of these mutants showed a detectable deficiency in repair of NMPs (data not shown). Thus, it is possible that the substrate shared by NER and Mag1 initiated BER is not NMPs, but a rare DNA lesion that cannot be detected by our technique. We note, however, that a very small amount of repair of NMPs does occur in mag1 cells if Rad1 is present (Fig. 8). This residual repair may be sufficient to cause the observed synergy between NER and the Mag1 initiated BER for MMS-induced lesions. A number of organisms have a strong backup pathway for repairing NMPs. In E. coli, the AlkA and Tag proteins can initiate repair of these lesions, even though the substrate specificity differs for the two enzymes (34Thomas L. Yang C.-H. Goldthwait D.A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1162-1169Google Scholar, 35Seeberg E. Eide L. Bjoras M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 391-397Google Scholar). In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, NMPs may be repaired primarily through the NER pathway, rather than a BER pathway (36Memisoglu A. Samson L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2104-2112Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, a pathway may exist that repairs 7MeG in the absence of the ordinarily used Aag DNA glycosylase (37Smith S.A. Engelward B.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3294-3300Google Scholar). However, deletion of the MAG1 gene in S. cerevisiae cells almost completely abolishes NMP repair (Fig. 8and data not shown), and no NMP repair can be seen in mag1 rad1 double deletion cells. This indicates that S. cerevisiae may lack a strong back up pathway for repairing NMPs. Finally, as observed with the yeast minichromosome YRpSO1 (8Li S. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12201-12204Google Scholar), there was a significant correlation between the nearest neighbor nucleotides of NMP sites and the repair of NMPs in the yeast genomicGAL1-10 region. These data suggest that the same repair machinery is used for repairing NMPs in genomic and minichromosome DNA. This finding is similar to that of Sweder and Hanawalt (38Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10696-10700Google Scholar), who studied repair of ultraviolet light-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in genomic and minichromosome DNA of yeast.

https://openalex.org/W1973953173,"The present study characterizes the interaction between the Raf-1 kinase domain and MEK1 and examines whether the magnitude of their interaction correlates to the ability of Raf to phosphorylate MEK1. Here we show that the minimal domain required for the Raf kinase activity starts from tryptophan 342. Maximal binding of the Raf kinase domain to MEK1 and its kinase activity are achieved upon phosphorylation of the region338SSYY341 in response to 4β-12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), or mutation of Y340Y341 to aspartic acids. Conversely, the TPA-stimulated MEK binding and kinase activity are diminished when this region is deleted or Ser338 and Ser339 are mutated to alanines. We also show that the integrity of the Raf ATP-binding site is necessary for the interaction between Raf-1 and MEK1. Furthermore, two MEK-binding sites are identified; the first is localized between amino acids 325 and 349, and the second is within the region between amino acids 350 and 648. Separately, the binding of each site to MEK1 is weak, but in a cis context, they give rise to a much stronger association, which can be further stimulated by TPA. Finally, we find that tryptophan 342, which is conserved among the Raf family and other protein kinases, is essential for the Ser338 phosphorylation of the full-length Raf and its binding to MEK1. Taken together, our results indicate that the phosphorylation of Ser338 and Tyr341 on Raf exerts an important effect on reconfiguring the two MEK-binding sites. As a result, these two sites coordinate to form a high affinity MEK-binding epitope, leading to a marked increase in Raf kinase activity. The present study characterizes the interaction between the Raf-1 kinase domain and MEK1 and examines whether the magnitude of their interaction correlates to the ability of Raf to phosphorylate MEK1.

Taken together, our results indicate that the phosphorylation of Ser338 and Tyr341 on Raf exerts an important effect on reconfiguring the two MEK-binding sites. As a result, these two sites coordinate to form a high affinity MEK-binding epitope, leading to a marked increase in Raf kinase activity. Raf-1 is a key enzyme in transition from a tyrosine phosphorylation event at the plasma membrane to serine/threonine phosphorylation in the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (1Kolch W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 289-305Google Scholar, 2Morrison D.K. Cutler R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Google Scholar). Activation of Raf-1 engages multiple concerted steps and factors, such as Ras binding, phosphorylation, and dimerization (1Kolch W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 289-305Google Scholar, 2Morrison D.K. Cutler R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Google Scholar). Phosphorylation plays both positive and negative roles in regulation of Raf-1 kinase. In the inactive state, Raf Ser259 is phosphorylated and bound by 14-3-3, thereby restraining spontaneous activation of Raf-1. In response to extracellular mitogens, Ras-GTP binds to a domain on Raf-1 amino-terminal to Ser259, which destabilizes the interaction between Ser(P)259 and 14-3-3 and allows dephosphorylation of this site and phosphorylation of other sites on Raf-1 to accomplish the activation process (3Abraham D.

Recent studies have shown that activation of Akt causes an inhibition of Raf-1 kinase in specific cell contexts such as muscle cell hypertrophy and differentiated myotubes (8Rommel C.

Zimmermann S. Schweneker M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31099-31106Google Scholar). This cross-regulation occurs through phosphorylation of Raf-1 Ser259 in accompany with an increase in 14-3-3 binding. Similar regulation also applies to B-Raf (12Guan K.L. Figueroa C. Brtva T.R. Zhu T. Taylor J. Barber T.D. Vojtek A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27354-27359Google Scholar). Compelling evidence has demonstrated that phosphorylation of the carboxyl moiety of Raf kinase plays an essential role in Raf-1 activation. This includes phosphorylation of Thr491, Ser494, Ser497, and Ser499 (13Chong H. Lee J. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3716-3727Google Scholar, 14Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H.

The regulation of Raf by protein kinase C impinges on both the amino and carboxyl termini (14Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R.

Marshall C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 109-112Google Scholar, 17Barnard D. Diaz B. Clawson D. Marshall M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1539-1547Google Scholar); on the other hand, it directly phosphorylates Ser497 and Ser499, resulting in an increase in its kinase activity (14Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G.

Thus, when the kinase domain of Raf-1 is expressed independently of its amino-terminal regulatory region, in contrast to growth factors, TPA 1The abbreviations used are: TPA, 4β-12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated and extracellular regulated kinase; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/Erk kinase.1The abbreviations used are: TPA, 4β-12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated and extracellular regulated kinase; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/Erk kinase. causes potent activation of Raf-1 (15Whitehurst C.E.

J. 2000; 351: 151-159Google Scholar). Another set of residues whose phosphorylation is critical for Raf activation is Ser338 and Tyr341 located in the junction region between the regulatory and kinase domains (20Fabian J.R. Daar I.O. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7170-7179Google Scholar, 21Mason C.S. Springer C.J. Cooper R.G. Superti-Furga G. Marshall C.J. Marais R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2137-2148Google Scholar, 22Diaz B.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2137-2148Google Scholar). γPAK, an isoform of p21-activated kinase, is the first kinase identified to phosphorylate Raf Ser338 (23King A.J. Sun H. Diaz B. Barnard D. Miao W. Bagrodia S. Marshall M.S. Nature. 1998; 396: 180-183Google Scholar), although the site may be phosphorylated by different kinases depending on the specific stimulus (24Chiloeches A. Mason C.S. Marais R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2423-2434Google Scholar). Likewise, the Src family is responsible for phosphorylation of Tyr340-Tyr341 (20Fabian J.R. Daar I.O. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7170-7179Google Scholar, 24Chiloeches A. Mason C.S. Marais R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2423-2434Google Scholar,25King A.J. Wireman R.S. Hamilton M. Marshall M.S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 497: 6-14Google Scholar). Mason et al. (21Mason C.S. Springer C.J. Cooper R.G. Superti-Furga G. Marshall C.J. Marais R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2137-2148Google Scholar) have described an incidence in which the mutation of Tyr341 to Phe abrogates Raf-1 activation despite normal phosphorylation of Ser338. Together with the observation that mutation of Ser338 to Ala abolishes Raf kinase activity, they suggest that phosphorylation of Ser338 is necessary but not sufficient for Raf activation. We have demonstrated that disrupting microtubules activates Raf-1, which occurs through activation of Rac/Cdc42/Pak pathway (26Zang M. Waelde C.A. Xiang X. Rana A. Wen R. Luo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25157-25165Google Scholar). In vivo, Pak strongly stimulates phosphorylation of Raf-1 Ser338 concomitant with an increase in the Erk activation (27Zang M. Hayne C. Luo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4395-4405Google Scholar), which can be further boosted by other stimuli (26Zang M. Waelde C.A. Xiang X. Rana A. Wen R. Luo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25157-25165Google Scholar). The physical association between Pak1 and Raf-1 occurs under physiological conditions and depending on the activation state of Pak1 (27Zang M. Hayne C. Luo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4395-4405Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Raf-binding site has been localized to the carboxyl-terminal kinase domain of Pak1. All of these data suggest that Pak serves as a physiological upstream kinase phosphorylating Raf Ser338. Although the role of phosphorylation of Ser338 has been well accepted in Raf activation, the mechanism by which it regulates Raf kinase activity has yet to be addressed. The present study attempts to evaluate whether the ability of Raf to associate with MEK1 is regulated via phosphorylation of Ser338 during Raf activation. We demonstrate that the magnitude of Raf-1 kinase activation closely correlates with its ability to bind to MEK. Furthermore, two MEK-binding sites are present in Raf-1, and the interaction of these two sites on the cis context with MEK are greatly enhanced in response to phosphorylation of Ser338. 4β-12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10.2 were purchased from Sigma. The anti-GST and Raf (E10) monoclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). GSH-Sepharose was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The rat monoclonal antibody against Raf-1 Ser(P)338 was a gift from R. Marais. The anti-EE epitope antibody was from Dr. A. Makkinje. cDNA for Raf-1, tagged amino-terminally by a Myc epitope, was inserted into the pMT2 plasmid, (28Luo Z. Tzivion G. Belshaw P.J. Vavvas D. Marshall M. Avruch J. Nature. 1996; 383: 181-185Google Scholar). 14-3-3 and Ki-Ras (V12) were cloned into pEBG (29Luo Z.J. Zhang X.F. Rapp U. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23681-23687Google Scholar). pCDNA1.1 MEK1 encoding mouse MEK1 tagged at its amino terminus with an EE epitope was a gift from R. Erikson. pFR-Luc and pFA2-Elk1 were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Site-specific mutations and deletion truncations were conducted by the PCR using Pfupolymerase and using wild type or mutant Raf as templates. The primers for mutagenesis were synthesized by incorporating a BamHI site immediately before the Raf-1 sequence and the PCR start sites indicated in Fig. 1. The carboxyl-terminal Raf mutants were inserted into pEBG by replacing the wild type BamHI/EcoRV fragment (GGATCC (BamHI) CAG (starting from Raf amino acids 325) GAGAAAAACAAAATTAGG; the EcoRV site is contained within the human Raf-1 cDNA near the carboxyl terminus of Raf-1) (26Zang M. Waelde C.A. Xiang X. Rana A. Wen R. Luo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25157-25165Google Scholar). To make Raf 325/349, two complementary synthetic oligonucleotides were directly inserted into the pEBG vector at theBamHI and NotI sites. For mutating Trp342 to Ala or His, oligonucleotides containing specific conversion were synthesized, and two fragments with overlapping mutated sites were amplified separately. The outside upstream and downstream primers were then used to amplify the full-length mutant Raf-1 from the mutated fragments. The final PCR products were inserted into pMT2. All of the mutants were verified by sequencing. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK293T) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfection of plasmid DNA was carried out using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (26Zang M. Waelde C.A. Xiang X. Rana A. Wen R. Luo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25157-25165Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were serum-starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum for 16–20 h, treated with TPA for 15 min, and then burst in a lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 25 mm β-glycerol-phosphate, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors) (26Zang M. Waelde C.A. Xiang X. Rana A. Wen R. Luo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25157-25165Google Scholar). The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g at 4 °C for 15 min, and the protein concentrations were measured using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. For Western blotting, the cell extracts were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked, incubated with specific antibodies, and then with incubated an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by the ECL. For immunoprecipitation, proteins of interests were first normalized by Western blotting. Cell lysates containing equal amounts of specific proteins were then incubated with protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) preabsorbed with specific antibodies at 4 °C overnight. The precipitates were washed three times with the lysis buffer and twice with a kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). For purification of recombinant GST-Raf, the lysates were incubated with GSH beads and washed the same as for immunoprecipitation. Raf-1 kinase activity was measured by a coupled enzyme assay in which bacterially expressed recombinant GST-MEK1 (0.2 μg) and the kinase-dead mutant of ERK2 (2 μg) were sequentially added to the Raf preparation in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (100 μm, 4000 cpm/pmol) in a total volume of 50 μl (30Hayne C. Tzivion G. Luo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31876-31882Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by the addition of a SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and visualized by autoradiography. The radiolabeled Erk2 bands were excised and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Luciferase activity was assayed according to the Promega protocol. Briefly, Raf mutants and reporter plasmids including pFA2-Elk1 and pFR-Luc were transfected into HEK293T cells. To monitor transfection efficiency, a plasmid encoding a secreted alkaline phosphatase was co-transfected. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cell culture media were saved for alkaline phosphatase activity assay, and the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with lysis buffer provided in the kit. Aliquots of the cell extracts after the removal of cell debris were incubated with luciferase assay reagents, and the activity was analyzed with a luminometer (LKB Wallac). The secreted alkaline phosphatase was assayed using Clontech kit protocol. The activities of Raf-1 variants were obtained by division of the luciferase activity with the secreted alkaline phosphatase activity and subsequent division with Raf polypeptide densitometric unit. Phosphorylated Ser338 and/or Tyr341 are considered a key element for the catalytic function of Raf-1 kinase. Thus, the Raf mutants S338A and Y341F are regarded as kinase-defective. Because these residues are located outside the conserved kinase core domain, the present study attempts to define the minimal domain required for Raf-1 kinase activity and explore the relationship between the phosphorylation of Ser338 and Tyr341 and the minimal kinase domain, as reflected by the binding of Raf to MEK and its MEK kinase activity. To determine the functional unit of Raf-1 containing the catalytic activity, a series of deletion and point mutations were made to the kinase domain, as depicted in Fig.1. Previous studies demonstrated that the activity of the Raf catalytic domain devoid of the amino-terminal regulatory region could still be up-regulated by the treatment of cells with agents such as phorbol ester (15Whitehurst C.E. Owaki H. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Geppert T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5594-5599Google Scholar, 19Yip-Schneider M.T. Miao W. Lin A. Barnard D.S. Tzivion G. Marshall M.S. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 151-159Google Scholar). To compare the activity of the carboxyl-terminal kinase domain (amino acids 325–648) with the full-length Raf-1, the recombinant Raf variants, as indicated in Fig.2, were expressed as GST fusion proteins in HEK 293T cells and purified by GSH affinity beads, and the kinase activity was assayed in vitro by sequential addition of MEK and Erk. The specific activity was calculated by dividing the cpm of32P-Erk bands with the scan densitometric unit of Raf polypeptide, as shown in Fig. 2 A. The activities of both the kinase domain and the full-length Raf-1 were rather low, although the former was about 2-fold higher under the basal condition. Nevertheless, TPA markedly stimulated the activities of both Raf proteins to comparable levels. Next, the activation of endogenous Erk was examined. The results (Fig.2 B) revealed that without TPA treatment, the full-length Raf only modestly increased Erk phosphorylation, whereas the Raf kinase domain induced a potent Erk activation that was obviously severalfold higher and equal to the level at which Erk was aroused by TPA in the GST-transfected cells (lanes 1–3 and 5). In addition, TPA stimulated the Erk phosphorylation approximately to the same level in both the Raf full-length and carboxyl-terminal kinase domain-transfected cells (lane 4 and 6). Together, the results in Fig. 2 demonstrated that the basal activity of the Raf kinase domain in vivo was much greater than that of the full-length Raf, although the in vitro assay revealed that the amino-terminal truncation only caused a marginal increase in Raf kinase activity. Because the activity of the Raf kinase domain is regulated well by TPA, the present study focuses on characterization of the Raf kinase domain. To determine the minimal sequence required for the catalytic activity of Raf, deletion was made to amino acids 350, and the activity of this mutant was examined. As shown in Fig.3 A, whereas the Raf kinase domain containing residues 325–648, as a control, was potently activated by TPA, truncation to amino acids 350 caused a complete loss of Raf kinase activity. Although Raf 350/648 contained the entire catalytic domain (Gly356-Xaa-Gly-Xaa-Xaa-Gly) according to sequence alignment with cAMP-dependent protein kinase, we could not exclude the possibility that the truncation had altered the proper folding of the first β sheet, a structural tag to the catalytic domain, which is important for the catalytic function. Thus, another set of truncations was made, and the results revealed (Fig.3 B) that deletion of the amino-terminal 341 amino acids blunted TPA-induced activation. One more amino acid deletion essentially inhibited all of the Raf kinase activity. These findings suggest that 1) Trp342 is involved in acquisition of a proper conformation of Raf-1 and 2) the negative charge of the region encompassing 338SSYY341 is necessary for the maximal activation of Raf-1. To further evaluate the role of the region338SSYY341, we assessed the kinase activity of the Raf kinase domain variants, wild type, S338A/S339A, and Y340D/Y341D. As shown in Fig.4 A, mutation of Ser338-Ser339 to Ala-Ala diminished the kinase activity, similar to mutations made in the full-length Raf (S338A/S339A or Y340F/Y341F) (26Zang M. Waelde C.A. Xiang X. Rana A. Wen R. Luo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25157-25165Google Scholar). In contrast, conversion of Tyr340-Tyr341 to Asp-Asp generated a fully active kinase that could not be further boosted by TPA. The specific activity of Raf 325/648-Y340D/Y341D seemed to be underestimated because the mutant behaved as two closely migrated bands, which exaggerated the quantity of the polypeptide. To appraise the impact of Ser338 and Tyr341, the kinase domain was deleted to Ser338 or Tyr341 with or without aspartic acid substitution. Fig. 4 B shows that the deletion of the amino-terminal 337 amino acids greatly inhibited the in vitro Raf kinase activity, regardless of substituting Ser338 with aspartic acid, whereas the mutant 341D/648 was constitutively activated to the same extent as 325/648-Y340D/Y341D. When the precipitates were blotted with anti-Ser(P)338 antibody, phosphorylation of this site was markedly enhanced by TPA or by substitution of Tyr340 and Tyr341 with aspartic acids, whereas other mutants did not contain detectable phosphorylation. These results suggest that the phosphorylation of Ser338 and Tyr341 is critical for the activation of Raf kinase domain and that the phosphorylation of Tyr341 is more important than that of Ser338. To make sure that the in vitro Raf kinase activity mirrors the in vivo function of Raf, we employed a luciferase reporter system that is driven by activation of Elk1, a transcription factor that binds to the serum response element and activates transcription from serum response element-containing genes after phosphorylation of its carboxyl-terminal activation domain by Erk1/2 (31Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Google Scholar). In this system, the Elk1 activation domain is fused with the DNA-binding domain of the yeast Gal4 transcription factor, and luciferase is translated from mRNA, whose transcription is driven by the minimal promoter plus five contiguous Gal4-binding sites. We then assessed the effect of mutating the sequence surrounding338SSYY341 on the ability of Raf-1 to regulate Erk activity in vivo. Hence, plasmids encoding these two chimeric genes were co-transfected into HEK 293T cells with each of the Raf carboxyl kinase domain variants, 325/648, 342/648, 350/648, 343/648, Y341D/648, 338/648, S338D/648, 325/648-S338A/S339A, and 325/648-Y340D/Y341D. Similar to the in vitro kinase assay, as compared with Raf 325/648, deletion beyond the residue 342 eradicated Raf function, whereas the mutant Raf 341/648-Y341D contained the highest activity, as had the mutant 325/648-Y340D/Y341D, which was about 2-fold of the wild type (Fig. 4 C). The results also displayed some interesting findings wherein Raf variants 325/648-S338A/S339A, 338/648, and S338D/648 still possessed substantial amounts of kinase activity (30–60% that of wild type), whereas they lost the kinase activity as assayed in vitro (Fig. 4,A and B). Immunoblot of endogenous Erk with an anti-phospho-Erk antibody showed parallel changes. A loss of kinase activity resulting from deletion or point mutations of the negative region of Raf-1 could be attributed to the impairment of the physical interaction between Raf and MEK. To test this hypothesis, we first co-transfected plasmids bearing a cDNA for EE-tagged MEK1 into HEK 293T cells with Raf constructs encoding 325/648, 342/648, or 343/648 and compared their abilities to bind to MEK. The results (Fig.5 A) showed that the interaction between Raf 325/648 and MEK was greatly potentiated by TPA, consistent with the increase in the kinase activity. Deletion beyond residue 341 abrogated the response of Raf to TPA in binding to MEK, although the mutants exhibited a modestly increased binding at the basal level. In another experiment, we assessed the binding of Raf 325/648, 325/648-S338A/S339A, and 325/648-Y340D/Y341D to MEK1 (Fig.5 B). Conversion of Ser338-Ser339 to Ala-Ala severely impeded the association under both basal and TPA-stimulated conditions, whereas the double mutant Y340D/Y341D displayed the strongest binding. Again, these data were in agreement with the activity assays on these mutants, suggesting a mechanism by which phosphorylation of Ser338 or Tyr341facilitates an optimal conformation of Raf, allowing maximal binding and phosphorylation of MEK1. To determine whether binding of Raf to MEK requires its kinase activity, lysine 375, a crucial residue for ATP binding and phospho-transfer, was replaced by methionine in the Raf kinase domain that already had the Y340D/Y341D substitution. The binding was then examined for comparison with its active counterpart. To our surprise, the result shown in Fig. 5 C revealed that the binding of Raf Y340D/Y341D to MEK was almost completely wiped out by the Lys375 to Met mutation. This clearly indicates that the integrity of the Raf ATP-binding site is necessary for Raf binding to MEK. The necessity of the Raf sequence from amino acids 325 to 349 for both Raf binding to MEK1 and its kinase activity inspired us to ask whether an MEK-binding site is located in this region. Thus, this Raf segment was co-expressed as a GST fusion protein with MEK, and the binding was evaluated by reciprocal purification and immunoblot, as compared with the GST control. As shown in Fig.6 (A and B), GST-Raf 325/349 specifically associated with MEK1, because the binding withstood high salt washing and was not observed with the GST control. In the next experiment, Raf 325/349, 350/648, 325/648, and 1/259 were assayed for their abilities to bind to MEK. Whereas the amino-terminal fragment (1/259) did not exhibit any detectable binding, both 325/349 and 350/648 had a weak binding to MEK (Fig. 6 C). In contrast, TPA aroused a strong binding of Raf 325/648 to MEK, which was greater than the sum of the two. Thus, the present results indicate that these two independent sites cooperate on the single molecular context to confer Raf a high affinity binding to MEK in response to TPA. Studies by deletion mutations indicate that Trp342 is important for the activity of the Raf kinase domain and its binding to MEK. In evaluating the impact of Trp342 on the function of full-length Raf-1, the residue was first converted to alanine, and the response of the resultant mutant to TPA was examined. As shown in Fig.7 (A and B), whereas the wild type Raf was activated by TPA (about 5-fold), as well as by active mutants of Ras and Src, the mutation of Trp342to Ala disabled Raf activation, concomitant with a loss of the Ser338 phosphorylation. Alternatively, when Trp342 was replaced with histidine in the active mutant Raf-1 Y340D/Y341D, the kinase also became totally inactive (Fig.7 C). To exclude the possibility that the W342A mutation induced a conformational change in overall structure of Raf-1, we evaluated the binding of the wild type and mutant Raf to the two well characterized interacting proteins, Ras and 14-3-3, which are known to be important for active conformation of Raf-1. In this assay, Myc-Raf-1, wild type or W342A, was co-expressed with GST-Ki-Ras (V12) or GST-14-3-3, and the binding was examined. The result (Fig.8 A) demonstrated that these two Raf functional domains were not disturbed by the mutation. In fact, overexpression of this mutant kinase could compete with endogenous Raf for activators (e.g. Ras), resulting in an inhibition of Erk activation by Ki-Ras (V12) and TPA (Fig. 8 B). Finally, to explore whether the inhibition of Raf activation by the mutation is due to a decrease in Raf/MEK binding, the cDNAs for the wild type or the mutant Raf were introduced into HEK 293T cells with MEK1, and the binding was determined. Fig. 8 C shows that the mutation abolished TPA-stimulated binding of Raf to MEK, although it caused a mild increase in binding to MEK under the basal condition. This result was similar to those obtained with the truncation mutants (Fig. 5). Thus, we conclude that Trp342 is essential for both phosphorylation of Ser338 and TPA-stimulated binding to MEK1. An important feature of the Raf/MEK/Erk signaling module is the accuracy of signal transmission. Although individual kinases possess homology with those at the same level in other mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, they do not erroneously cross-phosphorylate substrates that are not in the same pathway. In the signal transduction cascade from Ras to Erk, many of the components are associated with each other through multiple interactions in addition to being tethered by scaffold proteins, so as to assure the accuracy and efficiency of signaling. The present study is the first to show that Raf-1 contains two sites that can independently bind to its substrate, MEK1. The results indicate that these two sites on the cis context cooperate to bind to MEK in response to TPA. Deletion of the amino-terminal site outside the core kinase domain abolishes Raf kinase activity because of loss of TPA-stimulated binding to MEK. Previous studies using transformation assays have demonstrated that truncation from the amino terminus causes progressive activation of Raf-1 (32Stanton Jr., V.P. Nichols D.W. Laudano A.P. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 639-647Google Scholar). In the present investigation, we have found that at the basal level, the in vitro activity of the Raf kinase domain is low, whereas it is highly active in vivo. Although it is not known what contributes to these different results, we could conceive several possibilities. First, the difference may be ascribed to the duration of the enzymatic reaction, because the in vitro kinase assay occurs in much less time (about 30 min), whereas the in vivo kinase reaction lasts more than 48 h. The latter is long enough to allow Raf phosphorylation of the endogenous substrate MEK to reach a high level. Hence, as long as it attains a threshold, even a small difference is sufficient to produce a significant change, leading to accumulation of considerable amount of active MEK and Erk. Secondly, the amino-terminal regulatory domain might restrain the interaction of the Raf kinase domain with MEK or with an adaptor protein between Raf and MEK, if it ever existed inside the cells. Thus, such an adaptor might bind better to the kinase domain than to the full length, resulting in potent activation of MEK. These possibilities are not mutually exclusive and should also be applicable to other carboxyl-terminal mutants, provided that they contain a functional unit of the catalytic domain (Fig. 4). The present study reinforces the notion that maximal activation of Raf kinase requires the phosphorylation of the sites Ser338and/or Tyr341. Accordingly, point mutation or deletion of these sites greatly impairs the in vitro enzymatic activity of Raf-1. Additionally, our study suggests that the negative charge on the residue 341 is more important than that of Ser338. Failure of the Raf mutant 338D/648 to respond to TPA (Fig. 4) implies that Tyr341 in these mutants is not phosphorylated, probably because of a loss of an additional sequence amino-terminal to Ser338 (residues 325–337) (Fig. 4). It is also possible that phosphorylated Ser338, rather than an acidic amino acid substitute, induces phosphorylation of Tyr341. Unfortunately, we were unable to detect it by using a Tyr(P)341 antibody and, instead, observed an increase in phosphorylation of Ser338 by mutation of Tyr340-Tyr341 to aspartic acid. Our results demonstrate that the phosphorylation of Raf Ser338 and/or Tyr341 markedly stimulates binding of Raf to MEK. The binding magnitudes of the Raf kinase domain mutants closely correlate with their abilities to phosphorylate MEK. We noticed that deletion or mutation of Trp342 (Raf 343/648 and Raf FL W342A) slightly increased Raf binding to MEK but reduced the TPA-stimulated binding that is even lower than the basal level (Figs.5 A and 8 C). The mechanism underlying this change remains unclear. Because the observed binding reflected the balance between association and dissociation, it is likely that Trp342, in cooperation with phosphorylated Ser338–Tyr341 residues, regulates the equilibrium with result of the increased binding. Conversely, the loss of such cooperation caused by the Trp342 mutation may favor the dissociation upon the treatment of cells with TPA. In other words, phosphorylation of other sites stimulated by TPA could facilitate the dissociation process in the absence of Trp342. McPerson et al. (33McPherson R.A. Taylor M.M. Hershey E.D. Sturgill T.W. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3616-3622Google Scholar) have recently reported a similar observation regarding the importance of Trp342, where its mutations to Ala, Asp, His, or Lys all eliminate the enzyme activity. The present study further demonstrates that Trp342 is necessary for phosphorylation of Ser338 and thus kinase activity. An in vitro study by using a synthetic peptide as a substrate by King et al. (25King A.J. Wireman R.S. Hamilton M. Marshall M.S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 497: 6-14Google Scholar) showed that Trp342 is dispensable for the phosphorylation of Ser338 by Pak3/γPak. There might be two explanations for this discrepancy; first, the Ser338 kinase in response to TPA, Src and Ras may be different from Pak, and second, phosphorylation of the peptide substrate is different from that of the intact molecule. The latter is more restrictive. It is intriguing to hypothesize that a tryptophan close to the amino terminus of the kinase domain plays a role in regulating the conformation of the kinase, because it can be found in almost all Raf family members and a number of other kinases, such as MEKK1 (34Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Google Scholar), MOS (35Watson R. Oskarsson M. Vande Woude G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4078-4082Google Scholar), KSR (36Therrien M. Chang H.C. Solomon N.M. Karim F.D. Wassarman D.A. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 879-888Google Scholar), and Src (37Gonfloni S. Williams J.C. Hattula K. Weijland A. Wierenga R.K. Superti-Furga G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7261-7271Google Scholar). The sequence surrounding Trp342 in Raf-1 shows the closest similarity to KSR and Src (QEWDI/mouse KSR, DAWEI/Src versus YYWEI/Raf-1). Although its role in KSR has not been addressed, tryptophan at the position 260 of Src exerts an inhibitory role by interacting with the Cα-helix and constraining the conformation of the Src catalytic domain so as to inhibit the phospho-transfer reaction. In light of the sequence alignment between Raf-1 and Src, it is reasonable to speculate that the role of tryptophan depends on the negative charge of the residue immediately amino-terminal to it. Thus, loss of Raf kinase activity by the Tyr341 to Ala or Phe mutation may be a consequence of transition of Raf conformation into the closed one, whereas mutation of Tyr340 to Ala does not have such an effect. In keeping with this, substitution of Tyr341 with Asp in the absence of additional amino-terminal sequence creates an active kinase. Likewise, we predict that mutation of Ala259 to Asp would generate a constitutively active form of Src. We also show that, when Lys375, a critical residue for ATP binding and phospho-transfer reaction, is mutated to methionine, Raf fails to bind to MEK (Fig. 5 C). This suggests that the Lys to Met mutation may disturb the tertiary structure of the Raf kinase domain, possibly because of loss of ATP binding. As a result, the kinase adapts an inactive, closed conformation that is unfavorable to interact with MEK. Alternatively, phosphorylation of Ser338–Tyr341 may stimulate autophosphorylation of other sites such that they cooperate to expose two MEK-binding sites. These two possibilities are currently under investigation. In summary, an important finding in the present study is the identification of Trp342 as the start point of the minimal Raf catalytic unit and two MEK-binding sites on Raf-1, which extends our knowledge on the double-lock feature in the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway that confers specificity and efficiency in signaling. Binding of these two sites to MEK is greatly invoked by phosphorylation of Raf Ser338 and Tyr341 when they are on a single molecule. The stimulated MEK binding closely correlates with the increase in Raf kinase activity. This should serve as a framework for understanding phosphorylation of other substrates by Raf. We thank Drs. R.

https://openalex.org/W2098332918,"Disaggregation and reactivation of aggregated proteins by chaperones is well established. However, little is known regarding such kind of function of single-domain small cyclophilins (CyPs). Here we demonstrate that, with increasing concentrations, fully active adenosine kinase (AdK) of Leishmania donovani tends to form soluble aggregates, resulting in inactivation. Using this inactive enzyme as the substrate, it is shown that a CyP from L. donovani (LdCyP) alone can cause complete disaggregation, leading to reactivation of the enzyme. The reactivating ability of LdCyP remains unaffected even in the presence of cyclosporin A and macromolecular crowding agents. The reactivation occurs noncatalytically and is reversible. A truncated LdCyP, devoid of 88 amino acids from the N terminus, is found to be required in near stoichiometric proportion to reactivate AdK, suggesting essentiality of the C-terminal region. Gel filtration and light-scattering experiments together with protein cross-linking studies revealed that both full-length LdCyP and the truncated form directly interact with AdK and convert oligomeric forms of the enzyme to monomeric state. Homology modeling studies suggest that the exposed hydrophobic residues of LdCyP, by interacting with solvent-accessible hydrophobic surface of AdK, pull apart its aggregated inactive oligomers to functional monomers. Clearly, the results are consistent with the interpretation that the higher efficiency of the truncated LdCyP is most likely due to increased exposure of the hydrophobic residues on its surface. These observations, besides establishing L. donovani AdK as one of the model enzymes to study aggregation-disaggregation of proteins, raise the possibility that single-domain small CyPs, under physiological conditions, may regulate the activity of aggregation-prone proteins by ensuring their disaggregation.

The mechanism of protein folding in vitro is presently studied with a view to understand how proteins fold and remain active inside cells. Broadly, two in vitro approaches are followed to study the process of protein folding. The first approach involves prevention of aggregation of proteins by a variety of molecular chaperones during the process of refolding of chemically induced denatured proteins, whereas the second approach explains the kinetics of resolubilization and refolding of heat-treated artificial protein aggregates in the presence of such chaperones (1Skowyra D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Cell. 1990; 62: 939-944Google Scholar, 2Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Google Scholar, 3Diamant S. Ben-Zvi A.P. Bukau B. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21107-21113Google Scholar, 4Mitra Bhattacharya A. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28739-28743Google Scholar). These elegant studies conclude that during the process of folding, these groups of chaperones selectively recognize and bind with nonnative unstable protein folding intermediates mostly through exposed hydrophobic surfaces and thereby prevent aggregation (see Refs. 5Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Google Scholar and 6Dobson C.M. Karplus M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 92-101Google Scholar and references therein). Whereas these approaches under well definedin vitro conditions have provided us with an enormous amount of information about the mechanism of protein folding, the question of how protein aggregates, formed inside cells under various stress conditions, are disaggregated and reactivated within the complex cellular environment is still obscure (7Fink A.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 425-449Google Scholar, 8Jaenicke R. Seckler R. Bukau B. Molecular Chaperones and Folding Catalysts. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1999: 407-436Google Scholar). For instance, the major difference between the well defined in vitro condition and those faced inside cells is that the cellular environment is highly complex in terms of the number and concentrations of various soluble and insoluble macromolecules present (9Zimmerman S.B. Trach S.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 599-620Google Scholar, 10Martin J. Hartl F.-U. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1107-1112Google Scholar). This situation, known as a “crowded environment,” creates a significant reduction in intracellular space for macromolecules, resulting in an increase in association constants of macromolecules by several orders of magnitude (11Zimmermann S.B. Minton A.P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 27-65Google Scholar, 12Ellis R.J. Hartl F.-U. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 102-110Google Scholar). Cyclophilins (CyPs), 1The abbreviations used are: CyP, cyclophilin; LdCyP, CyP from L. donovani ; PPIase, peptidyl-prolylcis-trans-isomerase; CsA, cyclosporin A; AdK, adenosine kinase; DSS, disuccinimidyl suberate; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; BSA, bovine serum albumin a multigenic family of ubiquitous proteins carrying peptidyl-prolylcis-trans-isomerase (PPIase) activity, was originally discovered as a specific receptor of the immunosuppressive drug, cyclosporin A (CsA) (13Handschumacher R.E. Harding M.W. Rice J. Drugge R.J. Speicher D.W. Science. 1984; 226: 544-547Google Scholar). It has been shown that the formation of a CyP·CsA complex is an essential step for immunosuppressive effect of the drug (14Liu J. Albers M.W. Wandless T.J. Luan S. Albers D.G. Belshaw P.J. Cohen P. Mackintosh C. Klee C.B. Schreiber S.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3896-3901Google Scholar). Subsequent studies revealed that apart from mediating in the CsA-induced immunosuppressive effect, CyPs are involved in various cellular processes including protein-protein interaction, cell division, acceleration of protein folding, receptor maturation, and several other mechanisms (15Schreiber S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 283-287Google Scholar, 16Lodish H.F. Kong N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14835-14838Google Scholar, 17Price E.R. Zydowski L.D. Jin M. Baker C.R. McKeon F.D. Walsh C.T. Proc. Nat.

Zuker C.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4886-4895Google Scholar). Alteration of activities of enzymes and transcription factors also occurs following complexation with CyPs (20Nadeau K. Das A. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1479-1487Google Scholar, 21Jaschke A. Mi H. Tropschug M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 763-769Google Scholar). It has been suggested that whereas multidomain large CyPs can function as chaperones, the small single-domain CyPs are restricted only to their PPIase-associated functions (22Fischer G. Schmid F.X. Bukau B. Molecular Chaperones and Folding Catalysts. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1999: 461-489Google Scholar). Leishmania donovani, a purine auxotrophic and dimorphic protozoan parasite, is the causative agent of kala azar in human. This protozoon exists as a flagellated promastigote (extracellular form) in the sand fly vector and transforms into amastigote (intracellular form) in the mammalian macrophages. Due to purine auxotrophy, this parasite utilizes host purines using its purine salvage pathway enzymes. Adenosine kinase (AdK), which catalyzes phosphorylation of Ado to AMP, is one of the key purine salvage pathway enzymes of this parasite. Because of its unique biochemical properties and stage-specific differential activity patterns, this enzyme is considered as one of the prospective drug-targeting sites (see Ref. 23Datta A.K. Bhaumik D. Chatterjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5515-5521Google Scholar, references therein, and Ref. 24Schumacher M.A. Scott D.M. Mathews I.I. Ealick S.E. Roos D.S. Ullman B. Brennan R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 875-893Google Scholar). One of the major activities of this laboratory centers around studies related to structure-function analysis of this enzyme (25Ghosh M. Datta A.K. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 295-301Google Scholar, 26Bagui T.K. Ghosh M. Datta A.K. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 439-445Google Scholar, 27Sinha K.M. Ghosh M. Das I. Datta A.K. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 667-673Google Scholar). During kinetic analysis, it was unexpectedly noticed that the purified AdK, at higher concentrations, ceases to follow linear kinetics. While investigating the possible cause of this inactivation, we discovered that AdK, which is fully active under dilute conditions, tends to form soluble aggregates at higher concentrations, resulting in inactivation. Recently, we reported identification and cloning of a CyPB homologue (LdCyP) from L. donovani and suggested chaperonic function of this protein (28Dutta M. Delhi P. Sinha K.M. Banerjee R. Datta A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19294-19300Google Scholar). Using the inactive AdK as the substrate, we herein report a novel finding that this small single-domain CyP fromL. donovani, alone, can completely convert this enzyme from inactive oligomers to its active monomeric form. Macromolecular crowding agents (viz. BSA or Ficoll 70), known to mimic thein vivo excluded volume effects, did not appear to affect the process (29van den Berg B. Ellis R.J. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6927-6933Google Scholar). Disaggregation and reactivation of heat-aggregated proteins by conventional chaperones such as groEL, DnaK, or Hsp104 has been extensively analyzed (1Skowyra D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Cell. 1990; 62: 939-944Google Scholar, 2Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Google Scholar, 3Diamant S. Ben-Zvi A.P. Bukau B. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21107-21113Google Scholar, 4Mitra Bhattacharya A. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28739-28743Google Scholar). It has also been shown that CyP acts as chaperone (18Freskgard P.-O. Bergenhem N. Jonsson B.-H. Svensson M. Carlsson U. Science. 1992; 258: 466-468Google Scholar, 30Ou W.-B. Luo W. Park Y.-D. Zhou H.-M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2346-2353Google Scholar). In those experiments, using guanidine HCl-treated human carbonic anhydrase, Freskgard et al. (18Freskgard P.-O. Bergenhem N. Jonsson B.-H. Svensson M. Carlsson U. Science. 1992; 258: 466-468Google Scholar) suggested that the chaperone function of CyP is exerted only at the early folding intermediate state, thereby preventing off-pathway reaction, and the isomerase activity is performed later in the folding process, whereas Ou et al. (30Ou W.-B. Luo W. Park Y.-D. Zhou H.-M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2346-2353Google Scholar) observed that the ability of the inactive PPIase to effect reactivation of denatured creatine kinase and prevent its aggregation during folding was weaker than that of active PPIase. In other words, most of the studies on chaperone function of CyP described so far, dealt with prevention or suppression of aggregation during the early steps of protein folding. However, these results never addressed whether small single-domain CyPs could rescue functional monomers from already aggregated inactive proteins. Our experiments demonstrating the ability of LdCyP to reactivate such a type of soluble aggregates of proteins in vitro is therefore clearly unique and may reflect the capacity of CyPs to carry out similar functions in vivo. These results further suggest that, unlike most of the large immunophilins, both PPIase and chaperone activities of single-domain CyP reside in the C-terminal region of the protein. All chemicals used were of analytical grade. [2-3H]adenosine (23 Ci/mmol) was the product of AmershamBiosciences. CsA was the gift from Dr. G. Engel of Sandoz Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland). Disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS), a noncleavable, amine-reactive, homobifunctional cross-linker, was purchased from Pierce. The complete coding sequence (1035 bp) of L. donovani AdK (27Sinha K.M. Ghosh M. Das I. Datta A.K. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 667-673Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR and ligated in-frame at the BamHI/KpnI sites of pQE30 expression plasmid (Qiagen), resulting in isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible expression of the AdK as an N-terminal 6-histidine-tagged fusion protein. AdK from Escherichia coli M15 cells harboring the plasmid was purified to near homogeneity using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column as per the manufacturer's suggested procedure. For all of the biochemical experiments, imidazole-eluted His-tagged AdK, extensively dialyzed against a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol was used. Full-length recombinant LdCyP was expressed and purified using procedures described previously (28Dutta M. Delhi P. Sinha K.M. Banerjee R. Datta A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19294-19300Google Scholar). To construct the N-terminal deleted clone of LdCyP (N22–88-DEL), the coding sequence (amino acids 89–187) was amplified by PCR and ligated in-frame at theBamHI/SalI sites of the expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen). The 5′-PCR primer (sense), 5′-CGACCAGGATCCGACTTCACCAACTTCGATG-3′ with aBamHI site and 3′-primer (antisense), 5′-CGACCTCTCGAGTCAGCCTCCCCCTTCCTC-3′ containing aXhoI site were used. Using the similar strategy, three C-terminal deleted fragments (viz. C89–187-DEL, C142–187-DEL, and C105–187-DEL) were ligated at the BamHI/PstI sites of the expression vector pQE32. E. coli M15 cells harboring all of these chimeric plasmids, when exposed to isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, led to induction of fusion proteins with a His6 tag at the N terminus. Purification of the full-length and N-terminal deleted CyP (N22–88-DEL) to homogeneity was achieved using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column as per the manufacturer's suggested procedure. For all biochemical experiments, the purified proteins were extensively dialyzed against a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. However, while purifying all three C-terminal deleted clones, most of the proteins were found in the inclusion body and could not be solubilized under normal nondenaturing conditions. Even when these proteins were purified under denaturing conditions using 8m urea, they could not be refolded. AdK was routinely assayed at 30 °C by determining the formation adenine mononucleotide from [2-3H]adenosine in the presence of ATP and magnesium (31Bhaumik D. Datta A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4356-4361Google Scholar). The concentrations of [2-3H]adenosine (100 cpm/pmol) and ATP, in a 50-μl reaction mixture, were maintained at 50 μm and 1 mm, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, to follow the reactivation of AdK, LdCyP was added prior to initiation of the phosphorylation reaction by AdK. Wherever indicated, a large amount of Ficoll 70 (72 mg/ml) or BSA (80 mg/ml) was included to mimic the in vivo excluded volume effects (9Zimmerman S.B. Trach S.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 599-620Google Scholar, 10Martin J. Hartl F.-U. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1107-1112Google Scholar, 11Zimmermann S.B. Minton A.P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 27-65Google Scholar,31Bhaumik D. Datta A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4356-4361Google Scholar). During reactivation assays, the concentrations of protein substrate were chosen to obtain optimal rates of activation as measured by AMP formation. The reactivation of AdK was judged on the basis of (i) the increase in the rate of AMP formation at the initial stage of the reaction and (ii) the increased yield of AMP formed. Chemical cross-linking of AdK with either LdCyP or N22–88-DEL peptide was performed using DSS as the cross-linking agent. The optimal DSS concentration was determined to be 0.5 mm. Following preincubation (30 °C for 30 min) of a fixed concentration of AdK with variable stoichiometric proportions of LdCyP or its truncated form, the mixtures were further incubated for another 30 min in the presence of 0.5 mm DSS. An equal amount of the reaction mixture from each reaction were separated on SDS-PAGE (10 or 13%) and visualized after immunoblotting with polyclonal antisera against both LdCyP and AdK (28Dutta M. Delhi P. Sinha K.M. Banerjee R. Datta A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19294-19300Google Scholar,31Bhaumik D. Datta A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4356-4361Google Scholar). The oligomeric state of the AdK was analyzed by gel filtration using a Biosil Sec-250 (Bio-Rad) column. The column was equilibrated with buffer (20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 200 mmKCl). AdK (25 μg), LdCyP (12.5 μg), and a mixture of AdK (25 μg) and LdCyP (12.5 μg), made in 150 μl of equilibration buffer, were separately passed through the column using the same buffer. Flow rate was maintained at 0.8 ml/min. The absorbance was monitored at 220 nm. Molecular weights were estimated by gel filtration standards (Bio-Rad). At low concentrations, the scattering of macromolecules is governed by a Debye-Zimm relation. For noninteracting globular proteins of low molecular mass (<100 kDa), the scattering at 90° is directly proportional to the concentration (c) of proteins and their molecular weights (Mr). The equation is represented as follows, Rθ=K·c·MrEquation 1 where R θ represents Rayleigh scattering, and K is the constant that depends on the refractive index of the solvent. Assuming partial specific volume (ρ) of all globular proteins to be same, the equation further reduces to the following,Rθ=K′·c·rs3Equation 2 where Mr = 4/3r S3, r S represents the Stokes radius, and K′ is a new constant. When proteins are noninteracting, the scattering becomes directly proportional to the concentration of proteins and their Stokes radii. However, a deviation from linearity with increasing concentrations of the protein provides an indication of association-dissociation (32Pittz E.P. Lee J.C. Bablouzian B. Townend R. Timasheff S.N. Methods Enzymol. 1973; 27: 209-256Google Scholar, 33Harding S.E. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure—A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 219-251Google Scholar). Scattering was measured in a Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorometer at 25 °C. The excitation and emission wavelengths were fixed at 350 nm, where AdK and LdCyP had no absorption. Slit widths were 5 nm. Scattering of samples was followed for 5 min, and minimum values recorded for each sample were considered. Predictions of the three-dimensional structures of AdK, full-length LdCyP, and its truncated version were made by knowledge-based homology modeling using InsightII 98.0 of MSI (Biosym Technologies, San Diego, CA), ABGEN (34Mandal C. Kingery B.D. Anchin J.M. Subramanium S. Linthicum D.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 323-328Google Scholar), and our in house package of MODELYN and ANALYN (35Mandal C. MODELYN and ANALYN. Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata, India1998Google Scholar) in UNIX as well as in the Microsoft Windows environment. Energy minimization and molecular dynamics were performed with the InsightII 98.0/Discover package using the cff91 force field on a Silicon Graphics OCTANE work station. Energy minimizations were done with a convergence criterion of 0.001 kcal/mol, using a combination of steepest descent and conjugate gradient methods (100 steps each). Molecular dynamics simulations were performed using a time step of 1 fs for 100 steps of equilibration and 1000 steps of dynamics. In the case of truncated LdCyP, distance constraints were applied to the other parts of the molecule while running minimization and dynamics for regularization of selected segments. Repeated steps of molecular dynamics, selection of conformation with least potential energy, and energy minimization were performed until satisfactory conformational parameters were obtained. The electrostatic potential surfaces of the protein models were determined by MOLMOL (36Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Google Scholar). Protein BLAST (37Ltschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Google Scholar) was used for searching the homologous proteins of known structures taking AdK/LdCyP as the query sequence in the Protein Data Bank data base. ClustalW (38Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Google Scholar) was used for multiple alignments of protein sequences. PROCHECK (39Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar) was used for checking the structural parameters and comparing with reference protein structures. In the presence of saturating substrates, most enzymes under permissible assay conditions follow time-dependent linear reaction kinetics with increasing protein concentrations. The purified L. donovani AdK, however, was found to behave anomalously in this respect. At a comparatively low concentration of the enzyme, the rate of Ado phosphorylation, as expected, followed a linear kinetics. However, at higher concentrations of the protein, the reactions ceased to follow concentration and time-dependent linear reaction and became increasingly sluggish with time (Fig.1). The presence of LdCyP in the mixture clearly prevented this trend and allowed the reactions to proceed faster as evident from the increase in the rate of reaction and extent of AMP formation (Fig. 1, inset). The reactivation of AdK was not affected even when CsA was added in molar excess over LdCyP, indicating that the process is isomerase-independent. These results suggest that the observed sluggish rate of the reaction at higher concentrations of AdK was clearly not due to substrate limitation. The kinetic nature of the reaction remained identical even if the reaction was initiated with ATP, indicating that ATP did not have any role in the activation process (data not presented). Instead of LdCyP, BSA and other proteins like lysozyme and histone, even if added in a 20–400-fold excess, did not exert any stimulatory effect on AdK-mediated phosphorylation (Table I). Sorbitol, an osmolyte, also failed to reactivate the enzyme. Ficoll 70 and BSA are well known to mimic the in vivo excluded volume effects and are routinely used to create in vivo-like conditions (9Zimmerman S.B. Trach S.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 599-620Google Scholar, 10Martin J. Hartl F.-U. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1107-1112Google Scholar, 11Zimmermann S.B. Minton A.P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

To test whether these components exert any effect on LdCyP-mediated stimulation of AdK, large amounts of Ficoll 70 and BSA were included in the AdK reactivation assay. The stimulatory effect of LdCyP on AdK remained unaffected, indicating that the effect was very specific and occurred efficiently even in presence of macromolecular crowding agents (Table I). The stimulation was, however, inhibited in the presence of high concentration of KCl, suggesting that charged residues may play some indirect/direct role in AdK-LdCyP interaction. It should also be pointed out here that AdK isolated fromL. donovani cells also behave similarly in the presence of LdCyP (data not shown).Table IEffects of various agents and LdCyP on the activity of AdKExperimentAdK activitynmol AMP/mg/minAdK125AdK + BSA137AdK + histone143AdK + lysozyme142AdK + sorbitol126AdK + Ficoll 70126AdK + LdCyP501AdK + Ficoll 70 + LdCyP512AdK + BSA + LdCyP505AdK + KCl (1.2 M)125AdK + KCl (1.2 M) + LdCyP125The activity of AdK (10 nM) was measured at 30°C after 30 min.

Besides catalyzing cis-transisomerization of X-prolyl bonds of proteins, CyPs are known to be involved in protein-protein interaction (15Schreiber S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 283-287Google Scholar, 16Lodish H.F. Kong N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14835-14838Google Scholar, 19Baker E.K. Colley N.J. Zuker C.S.

In order to investigate the process of CsA-independent reactivation, the effect of increasing concentrations of LdCyP was tested on various amounts of AdK by both time-dependent kinetic and fixed time (30-min) assays (Fig. 2). Results indicated that with increasing LdCyP/AdK ratio, there was rapid increase in the extent of reactivation, as measured by the amount of AMP formed (Fig.2 A). Activity increase, discernible even at near stoichiometric ratio (1:1) of LdCyP/AdK, continued to rise further upon increase in LdCyP concentration. Fixed time assay (Fig. 2 B) also demonstrated similar increased stimulation of AdK upon increased concentration of LdCyP. A closer examination of the initial nature of the stimulation further revealed that the amount of LdCyP required for a similar extent of reactivation in different sets of reactions, containing different amounts of AdK, followed a clear inverse relationship with the amount of AdK present. At low AdK concentrations (physiologically suboptimal), all of the reactions, as expected of saturation kinetics, reached various levels of steady states with a molar excess of LdCyP, indicating that complete reactivation of the enzyme can indeed be attained, whereas, at high concentrations of AdK, the reactivation was manifested at concentrations of LdCyP close to 1:1 molar stoichiometry. However, due to the limitation of the assay system used here, it was not possible to determine the exact stoichiometry. Nevertheless, from these results, it is clear that the interaction of LdCyP with AdK that results in activation of the enzyme is probably governed by the product of active masses of the two reactants. Perhaps the large requirement for LdCyP at a low concentration of AdK was due to low probability of collision between AdK and LdCyP. Taken together, observations made in Figs. 1 and 2 led us to conclude that the action of LdCyP occurs most likely through protein-protein interaction rather than CsA-sensitivecis-trans isomerization. In order to gain an understanding as to how LdCyP leads to reactivation of AdK, we followed the effect of adding LdCyP at different time intervals during the progress of Ado phosphorylation (Fig. 3). Although the concentration of LdCyP chosen for this purpose was in molar excess over AdK, it was suboptimal with respect to its requirement for maximal stimulation of AdK present in the reaction mixture (Fig. 2). In the first step, three separate sets of phosphorylation reactions in the absence (reaction C) and in the presence of 5 μm (reaction B) and 22 μm (reaction A) LdCyP were started simultaneously using a fixed amount (50 nm) of AdK in each reaction. While the reaction containing a high molar excess of LdCyP (22 μm) was allowed to proceed uninterrupted for 120 min (reaction A), the other two sets, after a period of 30 min, were divided into two equal halves (reactions B and C). The incubation of all four subdivided reactions was further continued for 120 min with the difference that one of the subdivided reactions from each set received an additional dose of LdCyP that raised its final concentration to 22 μm. At the indicated time intervals, samples were withdrawn and processed for AMP formation. As expected, the reaction without LdCyP, after the initial few minutes, became sluggish (reaction C). In contrast, the other two sets of reactions (reactions A and B), depending upon the amount of LdCyP present, progressed with higher initial rates, resulting in increased yield of AMP. An additional dose of LdCyP to reactions B and C at the 30th min resulted in a further increase in"

https://openalex.org/W2011324397,"Aurora kinases have evolved as a new family of mitotic centrosome- and microtubule-associated kinases that regulate the structure and function of centrosomes and spindle. One of its members, Aurora-A, is a potential oncogene. Overexpression of Aurora-A is also implicated in defective centrosome duplication and segregation, leading to aneuploidy and tumorigenesis in various cancer cell types. However, the regulatory pathways for mammalian Aurora-A are not well understood. Exploiting the lethal phenotype associated with the overexpression of Aurora-A in yeast, we performed a dosage suppressor screen in yeast and report here the identification of a novel negative regulator of Aurora-A, named AIP (Aurora-A kinase Interacting Protein). AIP is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein that interacts specifically with human Aurora-A <i>in vivo</i>. Ectopic expression of AIP with Aurora-A in NIH 3T3 and COS cells results in the down-regulation of ectopically expressed Aurora-A protein levels, and this down-regulation is demonstrated to be the result of destabilization of Aurora-A through a proteasome-dependent protein degradation pathway. A noninteracting deletion mutant of AIP does not down-regulate Aurora-A protein, suggesting that the interaction is important for the protein degradation. AIP could therefore be a potential useful target gene for anti-tumor drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2157495692,"Skp1 is a subunit of the Skp1 cullin-1 F-box protein (SCF) family of E3 ubiquitin ligases and of other regulatory complexes in the cytoplasm and nucleus. In Dictyostelium, Skp1 is modified by a pentasaccharide with the type I blood group H antigen (Fucα1,2Galβ1,3GlcNAc-) at its core. Addition of the Fuc is catalyzed by FT85, a 768-amino acid protein whose fucosyltransferase activity maps to the C-terminal half of the protein. A strain whose FT85 gene is interrupted by a genetic insertion produces a truncated, GlcNAc-terminated glycan on Skp1, suggesting that FT85 may also have β-galactosyltransferase activity. In support of this model, highly purified native and recombinant FT85 are each able to galactosylate Skp1 from FT85 mutant cells. Site-directed mutagenesis of predicted key amino acids in the N-terminal region of FT85 abolishes Skp1 β-galactosyltransferase activity with minimal effects on the fucosyltransferase. In addition, a recombinant form of the N-terminal region exhibits β-galactosyltransferase but not fucosyltransferase activity. Kinetic analysis of FT85 suggests that its two glycosyltransferase activities normally modify Skp1 processively but can have partial function individually.

Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). Skp1 serves as an adaptor to link the F-box containing protein to the scaffold-like cullin-1, which is in turn linked to an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme via the ring H2 finger protein Roc1 (2Zheng N. Schulman B.A. Song L. Miller J.J. Jeffrey P.D. Wang P. Chu C. Koepp D.M. Elledge S.J. Pagano M. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P.

Other evidence suggests that Skp1 can also be associated with Snf1-related protein kinases, the kinetochore CBF3 complex, the RAVE-complex linked to assembly of the vacuolar proton transporter, and another complex(es) possibly involved in membrane trafficking (3West C.M.

Gaucher E.A. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 17R-27RCrossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The majority of Skp1 in both growing and developing Dictyostelium cells appears to be fully glycosylated based on Western blotM r analysis of whole cell Skp1, and partial glycosylation of Skp1 is required for its normal accumulation in the nucleus (6Sassi S. Sweetinburgh M. Erogul J. Zhang P. Teng-umnuay P. West C.M. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Assays have been developed for most of the enzymes of the Skp1 glycosylation pathway (3West C.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar, 5West C.M. van der Wel H. Gaucher E.A. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 17R-27RCrossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Analysis of subcellular fractions suggests that they modify Skp1 sequentially in the cytoplasm, rather than the secretory pathway (rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi) as for most glycosyltransferases that modify proteins. We have taken a proteomics approach to define the glycosylation pathway of Dictyostelium Skp1 (3West C.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar, 5West C.M. van der Wel H. Gaucher E.A. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 17R-27RCrossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Purification of the Skp1 fucosyltransferase (Fuc-Tase) activity led to the identification of the FT85 protein and its corresponding gene (7van der Wel H. Morris H.R. Panico M. Paxton T. Dell A.

Huynh A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12024-12035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). FT85 is required for Skp1 fucosylation as judged by the absence of Fuc-Tase activity in extracts of cells whose FT85 gene was modified by the replacement of its central coding region with a blastocidin resistance marker (7van der Wel H.

In addition, Skp1 made in these cells exhibits slightly increased mobility in SDS-PAGE consistent with the absence of Fuc and the outer, α-linked Gal residues. FT85 appears to be sufficient for Fuc-Tase activity based on expression studies inEscherichia coli (7van der Wel H. Morris H.R. Panico M. Paxton T. Dell A. Thomson J.M. West C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33952-33963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). With 768 amino acids, the FT85 sequence harbors two potential glycosyltransferase (GTase) domains. The C-terminal domain is sufficient, when expressed in FT85 mutant cells, to fucosylate the simple disaccharide substrate Galβ1,3GlcNAcα1-pNP. This corresponds to the core disaccharide of Skp1, therefore assigning Fuc-Tase activity to this domain. We report here that addition of the β1,3-linked Gal to Skp1 maps to the N-terminal half of FT85. The second and third sugars of the Skp1 glycosylation pathway are thus added by a single protein, which can act processively to efficiently extend the oligosaccharide chain. This molecular design has been previously observed for a class of glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of prokaryotic glycosaminoglycans (9DeAngelis P.L. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 9R-16RCrossref PubMed Google Scholar), and is distinct from the mechanism of synthesis of the type I blood group H antigen in animals (10Schachter H. Brockhausen I. Allen H.J. Kisailus E.C. Glycoconjugates; Composition, Structure, and Function. Marcel Dekker, New York1992: 263-332Google Scholar), which occurs in the Golgi apparatus using conventional type 2 membrane proteins with single GTase domains. For glycosidase digestions described in Fig. 2 B, Skp1 was isolated from the FT85-null strain HW260 by DEAE anion exchange chromatography of the crude S100 cell fraction, as described (8West C.M.

For the Fig. 6 Gal-Tase assays, the eluate from the mAb 3F9 step was applied directly to a Amersham Biosciences mini-Q column equilibrated in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mmMnCl2, which was mounted onto an Amersham Biosciences SmartSystem high pressure liquid chromatography unit. Skp1 was eluted with an ascending linear gradient of NaCl in the same buffer, and fractions were pooled based on A 280 values. SDS-PAGE and Western blot assays confirmed the identity and homogeneity of the pooled material. Skp1 pools were then concentrated in a Microcon centrifugal ultrafiltration cartridge (Amicon) with a nominalM r cut-off of 10,000, diluted in 20–50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and concentrated again to reduce NaCl levels.

Singly and doubly charged ions of bovine carbonic anhydrase II (Sigma; average mass = 28,980 daltons) analyzed in the same fashion were used as an external standard.

Fractions were pooled based on the presence of a Western blot band that was immunoreactive with mAb 9E10 directed against the c-myc epitope that was engineered at the C terminus of the domains. Protein was estimated using a Coomassie Blue dye-binding assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard (Pierce).

Assays performed in crude extracts were supplemented with 1 mm ATP, 3 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors (see above). β1,3-Gal-Tase activity was assayed similarly except that the donor was 1 μm UDP-[4,5-3H]Gal (30 Ci/mmol, diluted 5–20-fold with unlabeled UDP-Gal; New England Nuclear) or 2 μm UDP-[U-14C]Gal (300 mCi/mmol; American Radiochemical Corporation) as indicated, and the acceptor was Skp1-GlcNAc isolated from strain HW260. Linearity of reactions was established based on time-course studies. The radioactive product from the mixture of FT85, Skp1-GlcNAc purified from FT85 mutant (HW260) cells through the DEAE column step (see above), and UDP-[3H]Gal, was desalted by two passages over a PD10 column (Sephadex G-25; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 25 mm NH4Ac (pH 7.1). The void volume was distributed into multiple tubes each receiving 2,300 dpm, which were each taken to dryness in a vacuum centrifuge, redissolved in water, and taken to dryness again.

After 8-fold dilution in 50 mm NH4HCO3, a stock solution of 0.5 mg/ml TPCK trypsin (Worthington) in 1 mm HCl was added to a final concentration of 20 μg/ml and incubated at 37 °C for 8 h. The sample was heated at 100 °C for 5 min and taken to dryness by vacuum centrifugation, rehydrated, and dried again. Samples were redissolved in 100 μl of a solution containing the glycosidase to be tested dissolved in its appropriate buffer as described (4Teng-umnuay P. Morris H.R. Dell A. Panico M. Paxton T.

Glycosidases were bovine kidney β-galactosidase (cleaves Galβ1,3/4 > 6; Oxford Glycosciences), recombinant β-galactosidase (cleaves Galβ1,3/6; Glyko), Xanthomonas manihotis β-galactosidase (cleaves Galβ1,3; New England Biolabs), and green coffee bean α-galactosidase (cleaves Galα1,4 > 2/3≫6; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Digestions were incubated at 37 °C for 5 h, passed over 0.8 ml Dowex-2 columns in water, and analyzed in a liquid scintillation counter. Activity of α-galactosidase was verified by treatment of Skp1 glycopeptides that had been labeled in their α-linked Gal residues in vitro. 3H. van der Wel and C.M. West, unpublished data. Skp1 from FT85 mutant cells (strain HW260) migrates slightly more rapidly than normal Skp1 on SDS-PAGE gels consistent with the loss of Fuc and 2 Gal residues thought to be attached to Fuc (7van der Wel H.

To verify the structure of the glycan formed, Skp1 was purified to homogeneity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The A 280 profile of the final purification step on a C8-reversed phase column is shown in Fig. 1 A. MALDI-TOF-MS analysis of this material yielded an ion with anm/z value of 19,130 (Fig. 1 B), similar to the predicted M r of 19,132 of Skp1 in which the N-terminal Met has been removed, the new N terminus has beenN-acetylated, and Pro-143 has been hydroxylated and modified by a GlcNAc residue. These N-terminal modifications are consistent with previous results based on Edman degradation (11West C.M. Kozarov E. Teng-umnuay P. Gene. 1997; 200: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To confirm the modification on Pro-143, Skp1 was digested with endo-Lys-C, and the peptides were separated on a C18 reversed phase column.A 215 peaks were assigned based onm/z values determined by MALDI-TOF-MS (Fig.1 C). Peak 7 had a singly charged monoisotopicm/z value of 1853.8 (Fig. 1 D), which is identical to the MH+ value of the previously identified Skp1 peptide 139–151 (4Teng-umnuay P. Morris H.R. Dell A.

This peptide eluted as expected between the positions of peptide 139–151 modified at Pro-143 by GlcNAc-Gal (2017) and the unmodified peptide (1635) as indicated in Fig. 1 B and had no A 280 absorbance, consistent with the absence of amino acids that absorb at this wavelength. To confirm the identity of the glycopeptide, the grid voltage was increased to promote in-source decay (Fig. 1 D). This yielded new ions atm/z 1652, corresponding to the loss of a GlcNAc (1651 predicted), and 1725, corresponding to the loss of the C-terminal Lys (1724 predicted). A 215 peaks corresponding to alternative glycoforms were not detected (Fig. 1 C). Therefore, in the absence of FT85, Skp1 was missing its β-linked Gal in addition to Fuc and the outer sugars. The unexpected absence of the β1,3-linked Gal in addition to the outer sugars of the Skp1 glycan might be due to an absence of Skp1 β1,3-Gal-Tase activity in FT85 mutant cells. To test for Skp1 Gal-Tase activity, crude S100 extracts of FT85 mutant HW260 cells were incubated with UDP-[3H]Gal for 2 h, and incorporation of radioactivity into Skp1 was measured by running the extract on an SDS-PAGE gel, excising the gel band containing endogenous Skp1, and counting in a liquid sci"

However, several lines of evidence suggest that this neuronal κB-binding factor (NKBF) is not bona fide NF-κB. We have identified NKBF from cultures of neocortical neurons as a complex containing proteins related to Sp1. This complex was bound by antibodies to Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 and was competed from binding to an NF-κB element by an oligonucleotide containing an Sp1-binding site. This Sp1 oligonucleotide detected an abundant factor in neuronal nuclei that migrated in electrophoretic mobility shift assays at a position consistent with NKBF. Expression of transfected Sp1 stimulated transcription in a manner dependent upon a κBcis-element. Similar to our previous reports for NKBF (Mao, X., Moerman, A. M., Lucas, M. M., and Barger, S. W.

Expression of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-1 (NR1) subunit of glutamate receptors correlated with the activity of the Sp1-related factor, specifically through an Sp1 element in the NR1 promoter. These data provide the first evidence that Sp1 or related family members are responsible for κB-binding activity and are involved in a negative feedback for NR1 in central nervous system neurons.

Agonists often stimulate down-regulation of their receptors as a mechanism providing negative feedback. Glutamate plays a major role in many fundamental aspects of neurotransmission in the central nervous system (1Lipton S.A. Rosenberg P.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 613-622Google Scholar). On the other hand, it is also well known that glutamate contributes to many neuropathological states. Glutamate is able to kill many types of neurons through the phenomenon of excitotoxicity (2Choi D.W. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 369-379Google Scholar). By activating its ionotropic receptors, especially those of the NMDA 1The abbreviations used are: NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; NKBF, neuronal κB-binding factor; NR1, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-1; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; IL6, interleukin; RBP-Jκ, recombination signal binding protein Jκ; RT, reverse transcription; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. class, glutamate can generate an ion flux and free radical production so robust that cellular homeostatic mechanisms are overwhelmed. In a population of cortical neurons challenged with glutamate, a fraction die by rapid osmotic stress; however, others die 18–24 h later (2Choi D.W. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 369-379Google Scholar). This later cell death bears signs of apoptosis (2Choi D.W. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 369-379Google Scholar, 3Ankarcrona M. Dypbukt J.M. Bonfoco E. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. Lipton S.A. Nicotera P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 961-973Google Scholar) and is dependent on an early commitment phase. The commitment appears to involve calcium influx (4Choi D.W. Trends Neurosci. 1988; 11: 465-469Google Scholar) and a mitochondrial membrane permeability transition (5Schinder A.F. Olson E.C. Spitzer N.C. Montal M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6125-6133Google Scholar, 6Reynolds I.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 893: 33-41Google Scholar), but is otherwise incompletely understood. The delayed aspect of excitotoxicity permits consideration of changes in gene expression. The number of genes altered by glutamate receptor activation is also consistent with transcriptional contributions to the delayed component excitotoxicity. Unfortunately, the influence of abusive glutamate receptor stimulation on transcription is poorly characterized. Some reports have suggested that the transcription factor NF-κB is an important target for glutamate (7Guerrini L. Blasi F. Denis-Donini S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9077-9081Google Scholar, 8Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Baeuerle P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9618-9622Google Scholar, 9Grilli M. Goffi F. Memo M. Spano P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15002-15007Google Scholar). However, no defined role of NF-κB in neuronal death has been demonstrated in excitotoxic paradigms, and emerging data suggest that NF-κB might play completely different roles under different neurotoxic conditions (10Behl C. J. Neural Transm. 2000; 107: 393-407Google Scholar, 11Qin Z. Wang Y. Chasea T.N. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 80: 111-122Google Scholar, 12Yabe T. Wilson D. Schwartz J.P. J. Biol.

Glutamate is able to activate NF-κB in mouse and rat cerebellar cultures maintained in serum-containing medium (7Guerrini L. Blasi F. Denis-Donini S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9077-9081Google Scholar, 8Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Baeuerle P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9618-9622Google Scholar, 9Grilli M. Goffi F. Memo M. Spano P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15002-15007Google Scholar). However, by rigorously controlling glial numbers, we found that the prominent κB-binding factor in cultured cortical neurons is composed of proteins distinct from bona fide NF-κB (14Mao X. Moerman A.M. Lucas M.M. Barger S.W. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1851-1858Google Scholar, 15Moerman A.M. Mao X. Lucas M.M. Barger S.W. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 303-315Google Scholar). This neuronal κB-binding factor (NKBF) is distinct from NF-κB with regard to immunoreactivity, DNA binding preferences, and electrophoretic mobility under both denaturing and nondenaturing conditions. An additional distinction is that glutamate application diminishes NKBF activity; NF-κB is activated by glutamate only in cultures containing significant numbers of glia (14Mao X. Moerman A.M. Lucas M.M. Barger S.W. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1851-1858Google Scholar, 15Moerman A.M. Mao X. Lucas M.M. Barger S.W. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 303-315Google Scholar). NMDA receptors and calcium were involved in the diminution of NKBF by glutamate, and other data provided correlations between NKBF suppression and excitotoxicity (14Mao X. Moerman A.M. Lucas M.M. Barger S.W. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1851-1858Google Scholar). In light of the fact that Sp1 can compete with Rel factors for κB enhancers (16Hirano F. Tanaka H. Hirano Y. Hiramoto M. Handa H. Makino I. Scheidereit C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1266-1274Google Scholar), we explored the contribution of Sp1 family transcription factors to NKBF. Antibody reactivity and probe competition assays indicated that Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 contribute to NKBF binding activity. Glutamate was able to evoke a substantial reduction in Sp1-related factors in a time- and dose-dependent manner, as detected by DNA binding assays and immunoblot analysis of the Sp1 family polypeptide levels. More importantly, glutamate was capable of influencing expression of NMDA receptor-1 (NR1) expression through the modulation of Sp1-related factors, consistent with previous demonstrations of a role for Sp1 in NR1 transcriptional regulation (17Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7737-7744Google Scholar). Ig/HIV-κB, Sp1, and AP-1 oligonucleotides used in DNA binding assays were supplied by Promega (Madison, WI).

Invitrogen supplied all other oligonucleotides, including Ig/HIV-κΒ in assays where it was compared with other probes. The IL6-κB enhancer sequence (AATGTGGGATTTTCCCATGA, κB site is underlined) is derived from the human interleukin-6 gene promoter.

Luciferase reporter plasmids pNRL239, pNRL356, and pNRL356mtSp1×2 were generously provided by Dr. G. Bai (17Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7737-7744Google Scholar, 21Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5936-5942Google Scholar). These reporters are derivatives of pGL2-Basic (Promega) with insertions from the NR1 gene promoter. The pNRL239 plasmid contains NR1 promoter region −239 to −1 (translation initiation site as +1). The pNRL356 plasmid contains NR1 promoter region −356 to −1; two Sp1 sites located at −299 to −267 have been specifically mutated in pNRL356mtSp1×2. N9 cells were generously provided by Prof. P. Ricciardi-Castagnoli (22Corradin S.B. Mauel J. Donini S.D. Quattrocchi E. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Glia. 1993; 7: 255-262Google Scholar); they were maintained in minimal essential medium with Earle's salts (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Drosophila melanogaster SL2 cells (obtained from Dr. J. C. Azizkhan, Roswell Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY) were cultured at room temperature in Schneider'sDrosophila medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 12.5% fetal bovine serum and 10 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate. Primary neuronal cultures were established from the neocortices of 18-day Sprague-Dawley rat embryos as described previously (14Mao X. Moerman A.M. Lucas M.M. Barger S.W. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1851-1858Google Scholar) and were maintained in Neurobasal medium containing B27 supplement (Neurobasal/B27 medium; Invitrogen); 10 μm cytosine arabinoside was present during the first 4 days to suppress glial growth. All neuronal cultures were 8–10 days old at the time of treatment. To minimize background in experiments on expression of Sp1-related factors, the reporter construct pGL3-prom was modified by removal of the six Sp1 sites in its SV40 promoter. PCR was used to amplify the portion of the SV40 promoter downstream of the Sp1 sites: forward primer, 5′-CGAGCTCAGATCTCCCCATCGCTGACTAATT-3′ (the underlinedBglII site was included to facilitate subsequent cloning); and reverse primer, 5′-AAATAACGCGCCCAACACCG-3′. The amplimer was digested by BglII and BamHI, and then the Sp1-less SV40 promoter was used to replace the intact SV40 promoter. The resulting reporter gene with an Sp1-less SV40 promoter was termed pGL3-promΔ. To create a κB reporter construct (pβcE1-GL3), pGL3-promΔ received four copies of the κB element from the human β-amyloid precursor protein promoter, supplied by two insertions of the tandem oligonucleotide cassette: 5′-GGGGTTTCACCG TGT TAG CCA GAC GGGGTTTCACCG A-3′ (κB site is underlined). As a control for efficiency of transfection and survival, primary neurons were cotransfected with pRL-CMV, a plasmid encodingRenilla luciferase under the constitutive control of a cytomegalovirus promoter. When pRL-CMV was used as a transfection control in SL2 cells, the expression of Sp1-related factors consistently elevated Renilla luciferase activity. Therefore, a second control reporter was constructed in which theRenilla luciferase coding sequence replaced the firefly luciferase coding sequence located between NcoI andXbaI in pGL3-promΔ. The resulting reporter was pRL-promΔ, which was used as an efficiency control in experiments with SL2 cells. The specific protocols have been described previously (15Moerman A.M. Mao X. Lucas M.M. Barger S.W. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 303-315Google Scholar). Antibodies and unlabeled oligonucleotides were added to the binding reaction prior to addition of the radiolabeled NF-κB or Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide. For EMSAs including antibodies, the 15-min incubation period was extended to 60 min at 4 °C in the presence of antibody. For Western blot analysis, highly enriched neocortical neurons were treated with glutamate (50 μm) for the times indicated. After glutamate treatment, cultures were lysed in 80 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) and 2.5% SDS, and total proteins were harvested for Western blot analysis as described previously (15Moerman A.M. Mao X. Lucas M.M. Barger S.W. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 303-315Google Scholar). The decoy protocol has been described previously (23Mao X. Barger S.W. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 759-763Google Scholar). Briefly, 500 μl of minimal essential medium containing 3 μm decoy or scrambled oligonucleotide was dispensed into 500 μl of minimal essential medium containing 70 μl of LipofectAMINE suspension dropwise with constant mixing. The DNA/LipofectAMINE mixture was mixed vigorously for 15 s and then incubated for 30 min at room temperature before use. Fifty microliters of the DNA/LipofectAMINE mixture was added dropwise to each well of 24-well plates containing 450 μl of Neurobasal/B27 medium per well. The final concentration for decoy and scrambled oligonucleotides was 150 nm. Only marginal toxicity could be detected after long-term (≥72 h) decoy administration. After 24 h of decoy treatment, total RNA was harvested by Trireagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. The RNA concentration was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm. RNA was immediately used for RT-PCR or stored at −80 °C. The RT-PCR procedure was performed according to the manufacturer's protocols and has been described previously (24Li Y. Liu L. Kang J. Sheng J.G. Barger S.W. Mrak R.E. Griffin W.S.T. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 149-155Google Scholar). For NR1, the forward primer was 5′-CCTCCTGAGCGCAAGTACTCT-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-GCCGTGGATACTTGGAGTGA-3′, creating a 333-bp amplimer. For β-actin, the forward primer was 5′-GTCCTCTGCCATGTGGTTTTC-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-GCTGCGCTCTCGTAATTGTG-3′, creating a 439-bp amplimer. The PCR was performed at 94 °C for 30 s, 61 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for denaturation, annealing, and extension, respectively (27 and 24 cycles for NR1 and β-actin, respectively). SL2 cells were transfected with plasmids prepared from QIAGEN maxiprep kits by calcium phosphate coprecipitation. Cells were plated in 24-well plates at 106/ml with 0.5 ml of medium/well the day before transfection. Each well received 50 μl of a DNA/calcium phosphate suspension that contained 0.2 μg of reporter plasmid (pNRL series or pβcE1-GL3), 40 ng of pPAC series plasmids, 0.2 μg of pRL-promΔ, and an appropriate amount of inert carrier DNA to equalize to 2.0 μg of DNA. After 48 h, cells were harvested. The dual-luciferase reporter assay system was used to determine luciferase activities following the manufacturer's instructions in a Turner TD-20e luminometer. Transient transfection of primary neocortical neurons followed a calcium phosphate protocol optimized for these cells (25Xia Z. Dudek H. Miranti C.K. Greenberg M.E. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5425-5436Google Scholar). Extensive tests of plasmid/calcium phosphate concentrations and cell density were conduced to further optimize this protocol for our culture conditions. Ultimately, neurons were plated in 24-well plates at 2 × 105/cm2 and treated with cytosine arabinoside in Neurobasal/B27 medium to restrict glial cell numbers. After 8 daysin vitro, neurons were transfected with DNA/calcium phosphate suspension (at 40 μl/well) containing 0.2 μg of pNRL series plasmid, 0.2 μg of pRL-CMV, and 1.6 μg of carrier DNA. After a 3-h transfection, the medium containing DNA/calcium phosphate was removed, and the neurons were washed three times with HEPES-buffered Hanks' balanced salt solution and then maintained in fresh Neurobasal/B27 medium overnight. After this recovery phase, neurons were treated with glutamate (50 μm) for 60 min, followed by two washes with HEPES-buffered Hanks' balanced salt solution; neurons in control conditions experienced the same treatment lacking glutamate. Twenty hours after glutamate exposure, neurons were harvested, and the luciferase activities was determined. Glutamate did not evoke any significant activity change for Renillaluciferase. All experiments were repeated three times. In our investigations of the influence of glutamate on the activity of neuronal κB-binding factors, we found that the prominent factor binding a κB sequence in neurons is not composed ofbona fide NF-κB proteins (15Moerman A.M. Mao X. Lucas M.M. Barger S.W. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 303-315Google Scholar). This factor, which we termed NKBF, was found to have target sequence specificities that are subtly distinct from those of NF-κB, and its DNA-binding activity is diminished by toxic glutamate treatments in primary neuronal cultures (14Mao X. Moerman A.M. Lucas M.M. Barger S.W. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1851-1858Google Scholar). Sp1 and related factors can compete with NF-κB for binding to a DNA sequence (16Hirano F. Tanaka H. Hirano Y. Hiramoto M. Handa H. Makino I. Scheidereit C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1266-1274Google Scholar). Combined with the target DNA specificity of NKBF, this finding suggested that NKBF might include Sp1-related proteins. To test this possibility, EMSA analyses were performed utilizing antibodies directed against Sp1-related factors. Four such factors have been cloned: Sp1 and Sp3 are ubiquitously expressed in most cell and tissue types; Sp2 and Sp4 have more restricted expression patterns (26Suske G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 291-300Google Scholar), but high levels of Sp4 expression have been reported in the developing central nervous system (27Supp D.M. Witte D.P. Branford W.W. Smith E.P. Potter S.S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 176: 284-299Google Scholar). Therefore, Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 were investigated in extracts from primary cultures of neocortical neurons probed with an oligonucleotide probe containing an NF-κB-binding site. Antibodies against Sp1 family factors either supershifted or inactivated NKBF (Fig.1 A), and the combination of multiple antibodies was more efficient than an equivalent amount of a single antibody. For example, the combination of 0.9 μg of anti-Sp1 antibody and 0.9 μg of anti-Sp4 antibody (Fig. 1 A,lane 9) altered NKBF more effectively than did 1.8 μg of anti-Sp1 antibody alone (lane 3) or 1.8 μg of anti-Sp4 antibody alone (lane 7). The combination of antibodies against Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 almost completely abrogated the detection of NKBF (Fig. 1 A, lane 11). These data indicate that NKBF consists of Sp1 family factors. We previously observed an abundant, fast-migrating κB-binding activity (Complex III) in several cell and tissue populations (15Moerman A.M. Mao X. Lucas M.M. Barger S.W. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 303-315Google Scholar); this complex is insensitive to anti-Sp1 family antibodies. An Sp1-binding activity with the same mobility as NKBF was observed when an Sp1 consensus probe was used in EMSA (Fig. 1 B). With this probe, Complex III was absent, but a separate fast-migrating band appeared (Fig. 1 B,arrowhead). Antibodies against Sp1 family factors affected the NKBF-comigrating complex similarly to their influence on reactions with the NF-κB probe. The fast-migrating band observed with this probe was sensitive to anti-Sp3 antibody. No interactions between antibodies and the probe were observed when nuclear proteins were omitted in the reactions (Fig. 1 B, lanes 12–14). An unlabeled, double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide containing an Sp1-binding site was able to compete NKBF from a labeled NF-κB probe (data not shown). On the basis of its target sequence specificity and its mobility, we speculated that Complex III might include RBP-Jκ. The core sequence for RBP-Jκ binding is 5′-CCTGGGAAA-3′, which matches the sequence of the 3′-end of the Ig/HIV-κB probe, extending beyond the 3′-end of the κB consensus sequence. Furthermore, mutations in this portion of the probe disrupted Complex III binding (data not shown). Initial assays indicated that a monoclonal antibody (K0043) against RBP-Jκ supershifted Complex III with high efficiency. The supershifted RBP-Jκ complex had a mobility similar to that of native NKBF, potentially confounding interpretation. Therefore, we also performed this test with a sequence that allows Complex III formation, but is deficient in NKBF binding (IL6-κB) (Fig. 1 C). In EMSA of nuclear extracts from N9 microglial cells, anti-RBP-Jκ antibody caused a supershift of Complex III interacting with the IL6-κB probe. Furthermore, this analysis demonstrated that anti-RBP-Jκ antibody did not interfere with the DNA-binding activity of bona fideNF-κB present in the N9 extracts. A similar supershift pattern for Complex III was observed when neuronal nuclear extracts were used (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that the neuronal factors binding most prominently to the Ig/HIV-κB sequence are RBP-Jκ and a complex that includes members of the Sp1 family. However, RBP-Jκ binding depends on the bases at the 3′-end of this sequence rather than the core κB consensus sequence. To determine whether Sp1 or related factors can act as transactivating factors at κB cis-elements, we cotransfected an Sp1, Sp3, or Sp4 expression vector with a luciferase reporter plasmid containing four copies of a κB element. These experiments were performed in the Drosophila SL2 cell line, which lacks detectable Sp1-related activity. The reporter construct utilized the κB element from the promoter of the human β-amyloid precursor protein, as this sequence lacks the element responsible for RBP-Jκ binding (15Moerman A.M. Mao X. Lucas M.M. Barger S.W. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 303-315Google Scholar). Separate cultures were transfected with the above expression vectors alone, and nuclear extracts were prepared to confirm active protein production by EMSA analysis (Fig.2 A). When Sp1 was cotransfected with the κB-dependent reporter plasmid, luciferase activity was elevated over 2-fold (Fig. 2 B). Expression of Sp3 alone did not affect transcription from this particular κB element, and Sp3 did not appreciably affect the induction by Sp1. However, Sp4 expression significantly suppressed basal activity, and the combination of Sp3 and Sp4 significantly suppressed the induction by Sp1. We previously found that glutamate evokes reduction of NKBF DNA-binding activity in a time- and dose-dependent manner (14Mao X. Moerman A.M. Lucas M.M. Barger S.W. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1851-1858Google Scholar). This effect is correlated with glutamate neurotoxicity. To further characterize the relationship of Sp1 to NKBF, we tested the influence of glutamate on the DNA-binding activity of Sp1 and related factors in extracts from neocortical neurons. Glutamate influenced the gel retardation of an Sp1 consensus target probe in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig.3, A and B), reminiscent of its effects on NKBF binding to the Ig/HIV-κB probe. Substantial suppression of Sp1-related binding activity was observed only after long-term or high-dose glutamate exposure. This effect appeared to be specific to Sp1-related factors, as glutamate did not have a similar influence on the activities of other transcription factors tested. First, using a similar time course paradigm, we found that the DNA binding of transcription factor AP-1 was inhibited by short-term glutamate exposure and enhanced at longer times of glutamate treatment (Fig. 4 A), behavior that was essentially opposite that of the Sp1-related factors. Second, no significant influence (p = 0.9175) of glutamate on RBP-Jκ was observed (Fig. 4 B). On the other hand, glutamate treatment significantly inhibited the DNA-binding activity of Sp1-related factors (p = 0.0002, glutamate-treatedversus untreated). Surprisingly, the activity of Sp factors was fully restored after prolonged glutamate exposure (Fig.5), whereas glutamate inhibited the activity of Sp1-related factors for relatively short-term treatments (<18 h).Figure 4Glutamate specifically inhibits the activity of Sp factors. Nuclear extracts were prepared from neocortical neurons, and the DNA-binding activity was analyzed by EMSA.A, primary neocortical neurons were treated with 50 μm glutamate for the indicated times, and nuclear proteins (3 μg) were probed with an AP-1 enhancer sequence. For the time points between 0 and 60 min, a chase period followed the glutamate exposure such that the total elapsed time in all conditions was 60 min. *, percentage of control. B, neocortical neurons were treated with 50–300 μm glutamate for 60 min, and the DNA-binding activities of Sp1-related factors and RBP-Jκ were assayed with Sp1 and IL6-κB probes, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 5The DNA-binding activity of Sp1-related factors is fully restored after overnight glutamate treatments.Primary neocortical neurons were exposed to 50 μmglutamate for the indicated times. Nuclear proteins were harvested and probed for Sp1-binding activities in EMSA. Arrowheadsindicate fast-migrating complexes. F.P., free probe.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Interestingly, the diminution of the activity of Sp1-related factors was accompanied by the appearance of a fast-migrating species binding the Sp1 site probe (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 3,arrowheads). The possibility that this band arose from a fragment of an Sp1-related factor could not be confirmed by supershift, perhaps due to changes in the antigenic determinant. However, degradation of Sp1 family factors was suggested by Western blot analysis. When proteins from neocortical cultures were analyzed with an antibody against Sp1, a 78-kDa immunoreactive band was detected in neuronal cultures. The levels of this species were reduced by short-term glutamate exposure and recovered after long-term treatments (Fig. 6 B). Concomitant with the diminution of the 78-kDa band by glutamate, a smaller species (∼68 kDa) was initially enhanced. Its levels were also diminished by 12 h, perhaps due to loss of the 78-kDa precursor. The levels of Sp3 and Sp4 experienced a similar transient decline, although the precise time course was different for these proteins (Fig.6 B). Specifically, the lowest level of Sp3 was at 1 h, whereas for Sp4, it was at 6 h. Parallel cultures were subjected to EMSA (Fig. 6 A), confirming a correlation between Sp1-related DNA-binding activity and the described changes in Sp1 polypeptide levels. Sp1-binding sites appear to be important for expression of the NR1 glutamate receptor subunit (17Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7737-7744Google Scholar). Together with our demonstration of the attenuation by glutamate of Sp1-related DNA-binding activity, this relationship suggested a potential feedback inhibition of NR1 expression. Therefore, we assayed NR1 polypeptide levels by Western blot analysis in the same samples analyzed for Sp1-related factors. Application of glutamate to neocortical cultures resulted in a reduction of detectable NR1 protein, reaching ∼50% of its control level after a 3-h treatment (Fig. 6 B). Thus, reductions in NR1 expression correlated with the reduction of Sp1-related proteins by glutamate. As a more direct test of the role of Sp1-related proteins in control of NR1 expression, we sought to inhibit Sp1-related DNA-binding activity by loading the cells with"
https://openalex.org/W2074580642,"Nitric-oxide synthase type I (NOS I) is expressed primarily in gonadotrophs and in folliculo-stellate cells of the anterior pituitary. In gonadotrophs, the expression and the activity of NOS I are stimulated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) under both experimental and physiological conditions. In the present study, we show that pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is twice as potent as GnRH at increasing NOS I levels in cultured rat anterior pituitary cells. The action of PACAP is detectable after 4–6 h and maximal at 24 h, this effect is mimicked by 8-bromo-cAMP and cholera toxin and suppressed by H89 suggesting a mediation through the cAMP pathway. Surprisingly, NADPH diaphorase staining revealed that these changes occurred in gonadotrophs exclusively although PACAP and cAMP, in contrast to GnRH, have the potential to target several types of pituitary cells including folliculo-stellate cells. There was no measurable alteration in NOS I mRNA levels after cAMP or PACAP induction. PACAP also stimulated cGMP synthesis, which was maximal within 15 min and independent of cAMP, however, only part resulted from NOS I/soluble guanylate cyclase activation implying that in contrast to GnRH, PACAP has a dual mechanism in cGMP production. Interestingly, induction of NOS I by PACAP markedly enhanced the capacity of gonadotrophs to produce cGMP in response to GnRH. The fact that PACAP may act on gonadotrophs to alter NOS I levels, generate cGMP, and potentiate the cGMP response to GnRH, suggests that cGMP could play important cellular functions.

The secretory action of pituitary gonadotrophs is under a complex neuroendocrine control network that includes hypothalamic, gonadal, and locally produced hormones and other factors (1Evans J.J. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 46-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) of which gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), a decapeptide, is the most prominent among the hypothalamic regulatory peptides. In fact it is well established that GnRH acting through a specific G protein-coupled receptor present on the surface of gonadotrophs is crucial for gene expression, synthesis, and release of biologically active gonadotropins (2Gharib S.D. Wierman M.E. Shupnik M.A. Chin W.W. Endocr. Rev. 1990; 11: 177-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 3Counis R. Jutisz M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1991; 2: 181-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). GnRH also regulates a number of genes involved in GnRH signaling including its own receptor gene (4Counis R. Neill J. Knobil E. Encyclopedia of Reproduction. Vols. 2/4. Academic Press, San Diego1999: 507-520Google Scholar). Compared with GnRH, the function and mechanisms of action of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), another potential regulator of gonadotrophs is much less documented. PACAP is a 27- or 38-amino acid hypophysiotropic peptide first isolated from sheep hypothalamus by its ability to stimulate cAMP production in rat pituitary cells (5Miyata A. Arimura A. Dahl R.R. Minamino N. Uehara A. Jiang L. Culler M.D. Coy D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar). Intra-atrial injection of PACAP induces LH secretion in male rats. In vitro, PACAP stimulates only a weak secretion of LH and FSH by primary cultures of pituitary cells over 3–5 h (6Vaudry D. Gonzalez B.J. Basille M. Yon L. Fournier A. Vaudry H. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 269-324PubMed Google Scholar, 7Rawlings S.R. Hezareh M. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 4-29PubMed Google Scholar), however, longer stimulation periods appear more effective (8Hart G.R. Gowing H. Burrin J.M. J. Endocrinol. 1992; 134: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). PACAP also regulates the mRNA expression of the gonadotropin α, LHβ, and FSHβ subunits (9Tsujii T. Winters S.J. Life Sci. 1995; 56: 1103-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 10Tsujii T. Attardi B. Winters S.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 113: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). There is significant evidence that PACAP may act in synergy with GnRH to induce gonadotropin release with at least several of these effects mediated through cAMP (10Tsujii T. Attardi B. Winters S.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 113: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 11Culler M.D. Paschall C.S.

Metab. 1996; 7: 168-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that PACAP stimulates the promoter activity of rat GnRH receptor via the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway (14Pincas H. Laverrière J.N. Counis R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23562-23571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Finally, most of the pituitary endocrine cell types as well as folliculo-stellate cells have been shown to possess receptors to PACAP (7Rawlings S.R. Hezareh M. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 4-29PubMed Google Scholar). Gonadotrophs would express essentially, if not exclusively, PACAP-specific type 1 (PAC1) receptors that respond to PACAP via activation of phospholipase C in addition to adenylate cyclase, and Ca2+ mobilization (7Rawlings S.R. Hezareh M. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 4-29PubMed Google Scholar). In these cells PACAP would be a more potent stimulator of cAMP (EC50 ≈ 3 nm) than of inositol phosphate production (EC50 ≈ 20 nm) (15Schomerus E. Poch A. Bunting R. Mason W.T. McArdle C.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Similar to PACAP and suggesting possible interconnections between transduction mechanisms of both neurohormones, GnRH initiates several intracellular signaling pathways among which are the activation of phospholipase C resulting in the production of diacylglycerol and inositol phosphate that are responsible for protein kinase C (PKC) activation and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. GnRH also induces the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade and the production of cGMP. Recent studies have demonstrated that the latter two effects are indirect, the first resulting from the activation of PKC (16Naor Z. Benard O. Seger R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 91-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), and the second from the acute elevation of Ca2+ resulting in the activation of nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) type I (17Naor Z. Leifer A.M. Catt K.J. Endocrinology. 1980; 107: 1438-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18Lozach A. Garrel G. Lerrant Y. Bérault A. Counis R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 143: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). NOS I is one of the three NOS isoforms that have been described to date. Each is encoded by a distinct gene: type I (neuronal) and type III (endothelial) NOS are thought to be constitutive Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent enzymes, whereas type II, primarily found in macrophages, is inducible and Ca2+-independent. These enzymes catalyze the formation of nitric oxide (NO), a highly reactive and diffusible gas that plays an important role as an inter- or intracellular messenger and exerts, at least in part, its effects via the activation of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) (19Wang Y. Newton D.C. Marsden P.A. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1999; 13: 21-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 20Knowles R.G. Moncada S. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2491) Google Scholar). NOS I has been shown to mediate theN-methyl-d-aspartate action on GnRH secretion in the hypothalamus (21Bhat G.K. Mahesh V.B. Lamar C.A. Ping L. Aguan K. Brann D.W. Neuroendocrinology. 1995; 62: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 22Belsham D.D. Wetsel W.C. Mellon P.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 538-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), whereas an endothelial NOS III is involved in the estradiol-induced secretion of GnRH (23Prevot V. Bouret S. Stefano G.B. Beauvillain J. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 34: 27-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The identification of NOS I in pituitary gonadotrophs and folliculo-stellate cells (24Ceccatelli S.

A. 1993; 90: 11292-11296Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) has raised the possibility that NO may act as a regulator of pituitary activity. In mammals, the exact role of NO and cGMP on gonadotropin secretion is still controversial (18Lozach A. Garrel G. Lerrant Y. Bérault A. Counis R. Mol. Cell.

Zerani M. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 1217-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). An effect of NO and cGMP on growth hormone and prolactin secretion has been described in mammals (28Duvilanski B.H. Zambruno C. Seilicovich A. Pisera D. Lasaga M. Del C-Diaz M. Belova N. Rettori V.

Recent studies (27Garrel G. Lerrant Y. Siriostis C. Bérault A. Magre S. Bouchaud C. Counis R. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2163-2170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from our laboratory have provided evidence that GnRH stimulated NOS I gene expression and the consequent increase in NOS I protein in rat pituitary gonadotrophs. Moreover, this GnRH-dependent up-regulation of NOS I was distinct during an important physiologic event such as proestrus in female rats, leading to an amplified production of pituitary cGMP (18Lozach A. Garrel G. Lerrant Y. Bérault A. Counis R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 143: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Complementary to this, we have isolated a pituitary-specific promoter of NOS I that conferred responsiveness to GnRH as well as cAMP (34Bachir L.K. Laverrière J.N. Counis R. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4631-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The effect of PACAP on the GnRH signaling pathway (12Tsujii T. Ishizaka K. Winters S.J.

Sci. 1996; 805: 648-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and its ability to act through cAMP and Ca2+ prompted us to analyze the effect of PACAP on NOS I in the pituitary. We show that, like GnRH, PACAP augments pituitary levels of NOS I in vitro, via the cAMP/PKA-dependent transduction pathway, and that this NOS I is restricted to the gonadotrope cells. In addition, besides its stimulating effect on NOS I protein that occurs after a protracted period, PACAP also induces a rapid, cAMP-independent production of cGMP. The PACAP-induced NOS I appears fully functional because pretreatment with PACAP enhances the capacity of pituitary cells to produce cGMP and potentiates the cGMP response of gonadotrophs to GnRH. Collectively, data suggest that PACAP and GnRH operate together to regulate the NOS/cGMP signaling pathway in these cells. PACAP27, PACAP38, 8-Br-cAMP, H89, andN G-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA) were obtained from Alexis Corporation (Coger, Paris, France). TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate), PD98059 (2′-amino-3′-methoxyflavone), GF109203X (bisindolylmaleimide I), ODQ (1H-(1,2,4)-oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one), and A23187 were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Cholera toxin, IBMX (3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine), and triptorelin ([d-Trp6]GnRH) were provided by Sigma. Anterior pituitary glands were removed from male Wistar rats (200–220 g; Janvier, Le Genest-Saint-Isle, France). The cells were enzymatically dispersed using the trypsin dissociation procedure described previously (38Garrel G. Delahaye R. Hemmings B.A. Counis R. Neuroendocrinology. 1995; 62: 514-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cells in 300–350 μl of Ham's F-10 medium (Biomedia, Boussens, France) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Biomedia) and gentamycin (20 μg/ml, Sigma) were plated in 20-mm diameter Nunc multiwell culture dishes (Poly-labo, France) at a density 3 × 106 cells for Western blot analysis. After the 30–45 min required for cell attachment, the culture medium volume was adjusted to 2 ml and the cells were further incubated for 2 days at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Drugs were added in serum-free Ham's F-10 medium as described in the text and when required, inhibitors were added 1 h before incubation with secretagogues. At the end of the incubation period, the medium was removed and stored at −20 °C for quantitative analysis of gonadotropin release and the cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 10 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) before protein extraction. Protein extraction and Western analysis were performed as previously described (27Garrel G. Lerrant Y. Siriostis C. Bérault A. Magre S. Bouchaud C. Counis R. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2163-2170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pituitary cells (3 × 106 cells) were homogenized in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin. Homogenates were centrifuged for 45 min at 20,000 × gat 4 °C and protein concentration in the supernatant was determined according to Bradford (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213892) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated in slab gel electrophoresis using 7% polyacrylamide separating gel in a Mini-Protean-3 apparatus (Bio-Rad). Protein molecular weight markers (Kaleidoscope standards, Bio-Rad) were co-electrophoresed. After electrotransfer onto nitrocellulose membrane (Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany), NOS I, NOS II, or NOS III were immunodetected using specific affinity purified antibodies (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) at dilutions of 1/200, 1/1000, and 1/500, respectively, and the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham). Blots were exposed to Kodak XAR-5 films (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). The pituitary-specific promoter used in this study was previously isolated and characterized (34Bachir L.K. Laverrière J.N. Counis R. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4631-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The construct consisted of the full-length promoter (−1523 to +387) placed upstream of the firefly luciferase (Luc) reporter gene. Transfection assays were performed using the pituitary gonadotrope cell lines LβT2 and αT3-1 generated by P. Mellon (40Alarid E.T. Windle J.J. Whyte D.B. Mellon P.L. Development. 1996; 122: 3319-3329PubMed Google Scholar, 41Thomas P. Mellon P.L. Turgeon J.L. Waring D.W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2979-2989Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cells, grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2, were transfected using the LipofectAMINE Plus assay according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Invitrogen). Briefly, 1 × 105 cells were plated in 24-well plates in triplicate wells 24 h before transfection. 200 ng of promoter construct and 100 ng of pTK-Renilla (Promega Corp., Lyon, France) were combined with 0.6 μl of LipofectAMINE and 0.42 μl of Plus reagent in 250 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). The mixture was incubated for 15 min at room temperature before being added to the cells. After 6 h, the medium was replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 2% fetal calf serum, and penicillin/streptomycin, in the presence or absence of either substances to be tested. After 18 h, cells were harvested, lysed, and luciferase (firefly and renilla) activities were measured using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) (42Pincas H. Amoyel K. Counis R. Laverrière J.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 319-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The ratio of firefly luciferase to renilla luciferase activity served as a measure of normalized luciferase activity. Total RNA was prepared from cultured rat pituitary cells (3 × 106) using Tri-Insta-Pure (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium). Dots and hybridization were performed as previously described (27Garrel G. Lerrant Y. Siriostis C. Bérault A. Magre S. Bouchaud C. Counis R. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2163-2170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Lerrant Y. Kottler M.L. Bergametti F. Moumni M. Blumberg-Tick J. Counis R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2803-2808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a 1.2-kb rat NOS I complementary DNA (Alexis Corp.) as probe and cyclophilin mRNA for standardization. Pituitary cells (6 × 105) were plated in poly-l-lysine-coated (Sigma) chambers of Lab-Tek slides (Nalge Nunc Int., Poly-labo) in Ham's F-10 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. After 3 days, the medium was replaced and 20 nm PACAP38 or 1 mm 8-Br-cAMP was added to cells previously treated (1 h) or not with 30 μm H89. After 24 h, cells were washed with cold PBS, then fixed for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde, and rinsed three times for 10 min with PBS before permeabilization by incubation with 0.1% saponin for 15 min. After a further three washes with PBS, the NADPH diaphorase cytochemical procedure was performed as described previously (27Garrel G. Lerrant Y. Siriostis C. Bérault A. Magre S. Bouchaud C. Counis R. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2163-2170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in the dark at 37 °C for 30 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 1 mg/ml β-NADPH, 0.1 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium salt, and 0.3% Triton X-100. Following cytochemistry, the cells were further processed for immunochemistry. Gonadotrophs were identified with a mouse monoclonal immunoaffinity purified anti-bovine LHβ antibody (number 518B7) used at a 1/300 dilution (44Matteri R.L. Roser J.F. Baldwin D.M. Lipovetsky V. Papkoff H. Domest. Anim. Endocrinol. 1987; 4: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). All the other cell types were identified using rabbit polyclonal antibodies: folliculo-stellate cells with an anti-S100 protein (Immunotech, Marseille, France; dilution 1/600), lactotrophs with an anti-rat prolactin (number 27B14, dilution 1/200) (45Duhau L. Grassi J. Grouselle D. Enjalbert A. Grognet J.M. J. Immunoassay. 1991; 12: 233-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), somatotrophs with an anti-synthetic human growth hormone (NIDDK, National Institutes of Health (NIH), number IC-4, AFP-1613102481; dilution 1/100), corticotrophs with an anti-human ACTH (NIDDK (NIH), number IC-2, AFP-39013082; dilution 1/200), and thyrotrophs with an anti-rat TSHβ (NIDDK (NIH), number IC-1, AFP-1274789; dilution 1/200). Occasionally, FSH-containing gonadotrophs were immunoidentified with a polyclonal anti-rat FSHβ (NIDDK (NIH), number IC-2, AFP-HFSH6; dilution 1/100). After a 1-h incubation, cells were washed with PBS and then incubated with biotinylated donkey anti-rabbit Ig F(ab′)2 (dilution 1/500) or rhodamine goat anti-mouse Ig antibodies (dilution 1/200) for 45 min each, followed by 30 min with streptavidin-fluorescein complex (dilution 1/100). The cells were then washed in PBS and mounted with Vectashield (Biosys, Compiègne, France). Controls omitting primary antibodies were also performed. RIA, using kits provided by Dr. A. F. Parlow, National Hormone and Peptide Program (Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, CA) and NIDDK (NIH, Baltimore, MD), determined LH and FSH in the culture. Highly purified rat LH (NIDDK LH I-9) and rat FSH (NIDDK FSH I-8) were used for iodination (46Hunter W.M. Greenwood F.C. Nature. 1962; 194: 495-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (5840) Google Scholar), and rLH-RP3 and rFSH-RP2 were used as the references. Anti-rLH-S11 and anti-rFSH-S11 antisera were used at the appropriate dilution (1/750,000 and 1/125,000, respectively). Bound and free hormone were separated using immobilized protein A (47Gupta R. Morton D.L. Clin. Chem. 1979; 25: 752-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Anterior hemipituitaries dissected from male Wistar rats were incubated 1 h at 37 °C in culture medium 199 (Biomedia, Boussens, France). The tissues were then incubated for 1 h in the presence of 0.3 mm IBMX alone or in combination with appropriate concentrations of EGTA and inhibitors of NOS, sGC, or PKA as indicated in the text. Then, 50 nmPACAP38, 3 nm cholera toxin, or 10 nmtriptorelin was added and the incubation was continued for the indicated periods of time (from 15 to a maximum 60 min). Tissue and medium were separated and stored, at −80 and −20 °C, respectively, until use. Cells were used to test the effects of prolonged treatments with PACAP on cGMP production. Two-day cultures (1 × 106 cells/well) were incubated for 24 h in the absence or presence of 20 nm PACAP38 in serum-free Ham's F-10 culture medium. After medium removal, cells were incubated for 1 h without PACAP but in the presence of 0.3 mm IBMX alone or in combination with 1 mml-NMMA. The medium was renewed and the capacity of cells to produce cGMP was measured after an incubation of 1 h in the absence or presence of 1 nmtriptorelin. Cells and medium were collected and immediately used for cGMP assay. The cGMP was determined according to Steineret al. (48Steiner A.L. Parker C.W. Kipnis D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1106-1113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a commercial RIA kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Le Blanc-Mesnil, France) that required acetylation of the samples (49Frandsen E.K. Krishna G. Life Sci. 1976; 18: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Western blots were scanned and numeric images were analyzed with a computer image processing system (NIH Image software for densitometric analysis of gels). All given values are the mean ± S.E. of at least three separate experiments typically with three replicates for each experimental group. Differences between means were assessed by analysis of variance followed by Dunnett'st test. *, p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. The potential influence of PACAP on NOS I expression was examined over a 96-h period using primary cultures of rat anterior pituitary cells. According to the autoradiogram shown in Fig.1 A, pituitary cells contained detectable levels of NOS I under basal (nonstimulated) conditions, whereas neither NOS II nor NOS III were detected. As illustrated in the time course (Fig. 1 B) and concentration dependence (Fig.2) curves, PACAP38 and PACAP27 were both equally potent in increasing NOS I protein. The increase was detectable as early as 4–6 h after the addition of an optimal concentration of PACAP (≥10 nm). The maximum level was attained at 24 h representing a 3.59 ± 0.08-fold augmentation as compared with nonstimulated cells and remained elevated for the rest of the period examined (96 h). The EC50 deduced from the concentration dependence curves determined during a 24-h period was 1.36 ± 0.32 nm (Fig. 2). Neither NOS II nor NOS III were induced by 50 nm PACAP38 or PACAP27 over 24 h (Fig.1 A) indicative of a selective action of the neuropeptide on isoform I.Figure 2Concentration dependence of the stimulatory effects of PACAP on NOS I protein in rat pituitary cells. Rat anterior pituitary cells (3 × 106) were cultured for 24 h with increasing concentrations of PACAP38 or PACAP27 (range 0–100 nm). The NOS I level was determined by Western analysis and densitometric analysis of autoradiographs as indicated in Fig. 1. Values were expressed relative to nonstimulated cells.Inset shows LH and FSH released in medium (expressed as nanograms/ml).

Fig. 1 B shows that triptorelin also increased in vitro the level of NOS I. The time course was similar to that of PACAP, however, at the maximal effective concentration, GnRH was about two times less potent"
https://openalex.org/W2087691305,"Human host cell factor-1 (HCF-1) is essential for cell cycle progression and is required, in conjunction with the herpes simplex virus transactivator VP16, for induction of viral immediate-early gene expression. We show here that HCF-1 directly binds to the Myc-interacting protein Miz-1, a transcription factor that induces cell cycle arrest at G1, in part by directly stimulating expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p15INK4b. A domain encompassing amino acids 750–836, contained within a subregion of HCF-1 required for cell cycle progression, was sufficient to bind Miz-1. Conversely, HCF-1 interacted with two separate regions in Miz-1: the N-terminal POZ domain and a C-terminal domain (residues 637–803) previously shown to harbor determinants for interaction with c-Myc and the coactivator p300. The latter functioned as a potent transactivation domain when tethered to DNA, indicating that HCF-1 targets a transactivation function in Miz-1. HCF-1 or a Miz-1-binding fragment of HCF-1 repressed transactivation by Gal4-Miz-1 in transfection assays. Moreover, HCF-1 repressed Miz-1-mediated transactivation of a reporter gene linked to the p15INK4b promoter. Protein/protein interaction studies and transient transfection assays demonstrated that HCF-1 interferes with recruitment of p300 to Miz-1, similar to what has been reported with c-Myc. Our findings identify Miz-1 as a novel HCF-1-interacting partner and illustrate cross-talk between these two proteins that may be of consequence to their respective functions in gene regulation and their opposing effects on the cell cycle.

Numerous studies of VP16 and its association with Oct-1, HCF-1, and DNA have provided fundamental insights into mechanisms of transcriptional activation and how combinatorial networks of protein/protein and protein/DNA interactions underpin complexity, specificity, and diversity in transcriptional regulation (1Herr W.

Human HCF-1 is a ubiquitously expressed and evolutionarily conserved protein with a number of unusual properties and features (3Wilson A.C. LaMarco K. Peterson M.G. Herr W.

HCF-1 is synthesized as a 2035-amino acid long precursor protein that is autocatalytically processed at centrally reiterated 26-amino acid repeat elements (HCFPRO repeats) to generate a family of N- and C-terminal polypeptides that remain tightly, but noncovalently, associated with each other (10Wilson A.C.

Biol. 2000; 20: 6721-6730Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). VP16 associates with a discrete 380-residue N-terminal modular domain referred to as HCFVIC (also called the kelch domain), which is composed of six repeated copies of a kelch-like sequence proposed to form a barrel-like six-bladed β-propeller (14Wilson A.C. Freiman R.N. Goto H. Nishimoto T. Herr W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6139-6146Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The HCFVICdomain is necessary and sufficient to bind VP16, to stabilize VIC, and to promote transactivation (14Wilson A.C. Freiman R.N. Goto H. Nishimoto T. Herr W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6139-6146Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition to subserving a role in viral gene expression, HCF-1 is essential for normal cell cycle progression (6Goto H. Motomura S. Wilson A.C. Freiman R.N. Nakabeppu Y. Fukushima K. Fujishima M. Herr W. Nishimoto T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 726-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This finding arose from studies of tsBN67 cells, a temperature-sensitive hamster cell line that reversibly arrests at the G0/G1 decision point of the cell cycle at the nonpermissive temperature. The defect in tsBN67 cells is due to a single proline-to-serine missense mutation (P134S) at position 134 in HCF-1 (6Goto H. Motomura S. Wilson A.C. Freiman R.N. Nakabeppu Y. Fukushima K. Fujishima M. Herr W. Nishimoto T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 726-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Interestingly, HCF-1(P134S) also fails to bind to VP16 (14Wilson A.C. Freiman R.N. Goto H. Nishimoto T. Herr W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6139-6146Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), foretelling the existence of cellular factors that mimic VP16 in their interaction with HCF-1. The first such HCF-1-interacting cellular factor identified was LZIP (also called Luman) (15Freiman R.N. Herr W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3122-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 16Lu R. Yang P. O'Hare P. Misra V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5117-5126Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 17Lu R. Yang P. Padmakumar S. Misra V. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6291-6297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a basic leucine zipper protein belonging to the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein/activating transcription factor family of transcription factors. Like VP16, LZIP and a related protein called Zhangfei (18Lu R. Misra V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2446-2454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) target determinants in the HCFVIC domain. More recently, the transcription factors GA-binding protein (19Vogel J.L. Kristie T.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and Sp1 (20Gunther M. Laithier M. Brison O. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2000; 210: 131-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the nuclear hormone receptor co-regulatory factor PGC-1 (21Lin J. Puigserver P. Donovan J. Tarr P. Spiegelman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1645-1648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), and a protein phosphatase (22Ajuh P.M. Browne G.J. Hawkes N.A. Cohen P.T. Roberts S.G. Lamond A.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 678-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have been shown to associate with HCF-1. The foregoing adds to growing evidence that HCF-1 is an essential, multifunctional, co-regulatory protein that plays a global role in coordinating viral and cellular gene regulation and cell proliferation. However, the cellular role and mechanisms of action of HCF-1 and the identity of its cellular gene targets are essentially unknown. Recent findings show that HCF-1 is chromatin-associated, and it has been postulated that HCF-1 is recruited to DNA through its association with sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, analogous to what occurs with VP16 and Oct-1 (23Wysocka J. Reilly P.T. Herr W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3820-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The HCFVIC domain is necessary and sufficient for chromatin association, and the P134S mutation renders this association temperature-sensitive, suggesting that this detachment is responsible for the growth arrest phenotype in tsBN67 cells (23Wysocka J. Reilly P.T. Herr W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3820-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, the minimal region capable of rescuing tsBN67 cells encompasses residues 1–902, which include the HCFVICdomain and a downstream region rich in basic amino acids (6Goto H. Motomura S. Wilson A.C. Freiman R.N. Nakabeppu Y. Fukushima K. Fujishima M. Herr W. Nishimoto T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 726-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 14Wilson A.C. Freiman R.N. Goto H. Nishimoto T. Herr W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6139-6146Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Moreover, the binding of the cellular proteins LZIP and Zhangfei to HCF-1 is not required to rescue tsBN67 cells and to promote cell cycle progression (23Wysocka J. Reilly P.T. Herr W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3820-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 24Mahajan S.S. Wilson A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This indicates that other cellular factors important for cell cycle control that target the N-terminal domain and/or the basic region of HCF-1 may exist. The importance of the basic region in cell proliferation is underscored by recent studies with the HCF-1 family member HCF-2 and the related Caenorhabditis elegans homolog (25Johnson K.M. Mahajan S.S. Wilson A.C. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3930-3940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lee S. Herr W. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12402-12411Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). HCF-1, HCF-2, and C. elegansHCF share conserved N- and C-terminal domains; however, HCF-2 andC. elegans HCF lack the basic region and the central HCFPRO repeats. Although HCF-2 and C. elegansHCF are able to support VIC formation, these proteins are unable to rescue the temperature-sensitive cell cycle defect in tsBN67 cells (26Lee S. Herr W. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12402-12411Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Coexpression of HCF-2 inhibits rescue by HCF-1, however, suggesting that the two factors share a common interacting partner(s) (25Johnson K.M. Mahajan S.S. Wilson A.C. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3930-3940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The foregoing indicates that the basic region of HCF-1 provides an additional function that is required, in conjunction with the N-terminal proximal region, to promote cell cycle progression. To shed light on the cellular and functional roles of HCF-1, we carried out yeast two-hybrid interaction cloning with the HCF-1 basic region as bait to identify putative cellular factors that target this region. We show here that HCF-1 interacts physically and functionally with Miz-1, a recently identified cell cycle regulatory factor that was originally isolated by virtue of its ability to interact with the cellular oncoprotein c-Myc (27Peukert K. Staller P. Schneider A. Carmichael G. Hanel F. Eilers M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5672-5686Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 28Schneider A. Peukert K. Eilers M. Hanel F. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 224: 137-146PubMed Google Scholar, 29Sakamuro D. Prendergast G.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2942-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Miz-1 is an 803-amino acid long POZ domain/zinc finger transcription factor that modulates transcription by binding directly to initiator elements of target genes (27Peukert K. Staller P. Schneider A. Carmichael G. Hanel F. Eilers M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5672-5686Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 30Staller P. Peukert K. Kiermaier A. Seoane J. Lukas J. Karsunky H. Moroy T.

Cell. 2001; 8: 339-349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In contrast to the stimulation of cell cycle progression ascribed to HCF-1, Miz-1 causes cell cycle arrest at G1 (27Peukert K. Staller P. Schneider A. Carmichael G. Hanel F. Eilers M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5672-5686Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). This is manifested in part by Miz-1-mediated activation of the gene encoding the key cell cycle inhibitor p15INK4b, a potent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (30Staller P. Peukert K. Kiermaier A. Seoane J. Lukas J. Karsunky H. Moroy T. Bartek J. Massague J. Hanel F. Eilers M. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Accumulation of p15INK4b at G1 results in cell cycle arrest due to a reduction in cyclin D1-associated kinase activity. Recent studies have shown that transcriptional activation of p15INK4b and the subsequent cell cycle arrest are potentiated by the antimitogenic cytokine transforming growth factor-β and antagonized by the cell proliferation mediator c-Myc through opposing pathways that directly converge on Miz-1 (30Staller P. Peukert K. Kiermaier A. Seoane J. Lukas J. Karsunky H. Moroy T. Bartek J. Massague J. Hanel F. Eilers M. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 33Seoane J. Pouponnot C. Staller P. Schader M. Eilers M. Massague J. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: 400-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Thus, c-Myc binds directly to Miz-1 on the p15INK4b initiator element and represses Miz-1 transactivation by abrogating recruitment of the coactivator p300. Conversely, transforming growth factor-β activates SMAD proteins, which relieve c-Myc-mediated repression by causing the dissociation of c-Myc from Miz-1 and which directly transactivate the p15INK4b promoter in cooperation with Miz-1. Miz-1 is thus at the nexus of reciprocal growth regulatory signaling pathways that link p15INK4b to cell cycle control (32Amati B. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: E112-E113Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that Miz-1/HCF-1 association is manifested through the basic domain of HCF-1 and by two independent regions of Miz-1: the N-terminal POZ domain and a C-terminal transactivation domain. We further show that HCF-1 represses Miz-1-mediated transactivation of a reporter gene linked to the p15INK4b promoter, likely as a result of HCF-1 interfering with the recruitment of p300 to Miz-1. Thus, HCF-1 functions in a manner analogous to c-Myc in modulating Miz-1 function. Our findings point to a convergence between two regulatory proteins that have opposing roles in cell proliferation and may thus be relevant to the mechanisms by which HCF-1 promotes cell cycle progression. Mammalian expression vectors pCGNHCF and pFLAG-C1, encoding hemagglutinin/c-Myc and FLAG epitope-tagged derivatives of full-length human HCF-1, respectively, have been described (3Wilson A.C. LaMarco K. Peterson M.G. Herr W. Cell. 1993; 74: 115-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 18Lu R. Misra V.

Kristie, respectively. pCGNHCF-1FL(P134S) (where FL is full-length) was constructed by isolating a SpeI/XhoI fragment from pCGNHCF and inserting this fragment into pCGNHCF-1-(1–1011)(P134S), supplied by A. Wilson (25Johnson K.M. Mahajan S.S. Wilson A.C. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3930-3940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A mammalian expression vector encoding V5 epitope-tagged full-length Miz-1 was provided by R. Tjian (31Ziegelbauer J. Shan B. Yager D. Larabell C. Hoffmann B. Tjian R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 339-349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Mammalian expression vectors for full-length Miz-1 (pPK7) and human c-Myc (pMNBabeIRESc-Myc) were obtained from M. Eilers (27Peukert K. Staller P. Schneider A. Carmichael G. Hanel F. Eilers M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5672-5686Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) and L. Penn (University of Toronto), respectively. pGal4(5X)luc, a luciferase reporter vector that contains five upstream copies of the Gal4-binding site, was obtained from J. Hassell (McMaster University). p15INK4b luc, a luciferase reporter gene that contains sequences spanning −113 to +160 relative to the transcription start site of the p15INK4b promoter, was provided by M. Eilers (30Staller P. Peukert K. Kiermaier A. Seoane J. Lukas J. Karsunky H. Moroy T. Bartek J. Massague J. Hanel F. Eilers M. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The in vitro transcription vector pSPUTK was obtained from D. Andrews (McMaster University). The yeast two-hybrid bait plasmid pGBT9-HCF-1-(450–1439), which contains residues 450–1439 of HCF-1 linked to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DBD), was constructed by cloning a PCR fragment corresponding to this region into the two-hybrid vector pGBT9 (Clontech). Similarly, pGBT9-HCF-1-(1–380) expresses the HCFVIC subdomain. Deletions of HCF-1 were constructed in pGBT9 by conventional or PCR-based methods using appropriate primers. The Gal4 activation domain (AD)-VP16 fusion protein (residues 1–404 of VP16) was cloned into pGAD424 (Clontech). Mammalian Gal4-DBD-Miz-1 derivatives were derived by subcloning PCR-derivedXhoI/BamHI subfragments into the corresponding sites of the Gal4 fusion protein expression vector pSG424 by standard procedures. A mammalian expression plasmid for HCF-1-(750–902) was generated by amplifying this fragment from pCGNHCF and cloning into the XhoI site of pCMV/Myc/nuc (Invitrogen). This construct expresses HCF-1-(750–902) tagged with a c-Myc epitope and containing a nuclear localization signal at the C terminus. Various glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-HCF-1 and GST-Miz-1 derivatives, as indicated in the figure legends, were constructed by cloning PCR fragments into the EcoRI/SalI sites of pGEX4T1 (Amersham Biosciences). GST-VP16-(1–404) contains residues 1–404 of VP16 cloned into pGEX2T. In vitro transcription/translation vector for full-length Miz-1 was generated by cloning the Miz-1 open reading frame into the NcoI and SalI sites of pGEM5zf (Promega). In vitro expression vectors for Miz-1 derivatives expressing the POZ domain (residues 109–308) and residues 637–803 were generated by cloning PCR fragments into pSPUTK. In vitro expression vectors for HCF-1-(612–902) and HCF-1-(1–902) were constructed by cloning appropriate PCR fragments into pSPUTK and pGEM5zf, respectively. The GST-p300-(1572–2371) plasmid was obtained from R. Eckner, and the pcDNA-Myc vector used for in vitro transcription/translation was provided by M. Eilers. Site-directed mutagenesis of pGEM5zf-HCF-1-(1–902) to incorporate the P134S mutation was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the following mutagenic primers: 5′-AAAAACGGGCCCCCTTCGTGTCCTCGACTC-3′ and 5′-GAGTCGAGGACACGAAGGGGGCCCGTTTTTG-3′ (altered nucleotides are underlined). The authenticity of all clones constructed above was verified by DNA sequence analysis. Mammalian Gal4-VP16AAD, which expresses the Gal4 DBD linked to the C-terminal acidic activation domain of VP16 has been described (34Popova B. Bilan P. Xiao P. Faught M. Capone J.P. Virology. 1995; 209: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Two-hybrid analysis was carried out using the Clontech Matchmaker system essentially as described (35Bai C. Elledge S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 141-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 36$$Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast strain HF7c (MATa, ura3-52, his3-200,ade2-101, lys2-801, trp1-901,leu2-3,112, can r, gal4-542,gal80-538, URA3::GAL1-lacZ) was transformed with pGBT9-HCF-1-(450–1439) and a HeLa cell Matchmaker cDNA library fused to the Gal4 AD (Clontech) by the lithium acetate method (37Elble R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar). Independent transformants (2 × 106) were grown on His−, Leu−, and Trp− plates supplemented with 20 mm3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. Library plasmids from His+ colonies were selectively recovered from yeast following transformation intoEscherichia coli HB101 (leuB −), transformed along with pGBT9-HCF-1-(450–1439) or control Gal4-DBD plasmids into yeast strain Y190 and assayed for β-galactosidase activity using the β-galactosidase overlay assay (36$$Google Scholar). Colonies that scored positive for β-galactosidase activity in the presence of the HCF-1 bait plasmid, but not with control or irrelevant plasmids, were sequenced. One clone containing a partial cDNA encoding amino acids 269–803 of Miz-1 was selected for further studies. Protein binding assays with GST fusion proteins and [35S]methionine-radiolabeled proteins synthesized in vitro using a coupled rabbit reticulocyte transcription/translation system (Promega) were carried out as described previously (38Meertens L.M. Miyata K.S. Cechetto J.D. Rachubinski R.A. Capone J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6972-6978Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, E. coli BL21 cells harboring expression vectors for GST-Miz-1, GST-HCF-1, or GST alone were grown to an A 600 nm of 0.6–0.8 and induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Gibco BRL) for 3 h. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, and one tablet of mini C protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)/25 ml of buffer, and cell extracts were prepared by sonication. 50 μl of a 50:50 slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B was incubated with clarified cell extracts containing GST or GST fusion protein for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and beads containing equivalent amounts of bound protein (as determined by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels) were incubated with 10–20 μl of reticulocyte lysate containing radiolabeled translated protein in buffer A (150 mm KCl, 0.02 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mmMgCl2, and 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9)) for 2–3 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed extensively with buffer A lacking bovine serum albumin, and bound radiolabeled proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Competition assays were carried out with unlabeled competitor protein synthesized in vitro as detailed in the figure legends. The total amount of rabbit reticulocyte lysate was kept constant by adding unprogrammed lysate to the binding reactions as required. COS-1 cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were seeded in six-well plates at a concentration of 2–3 × 105 cells/well 1 day prior to transfection to achieve 70–80% confluence. Transfections were carried out using LipofectAMINE reagent (4–8 μl/well; Invitrogen) as outlined by the manufacturer. Unless indicated otherwise in the figure legends, transfections typically contained 0.5 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid (pGal4(5X)luc or p15INK4b luc) and 0.05–0.5 μg of various effector plasmids (HCF-1, Miz-1, c-Myc, or derivatives thereof). Total DNA and promoter dosage was kept constant with the appropriate amounts of corresponding empty vectors. Luciferase activity was assayed in cell lysates prepared 48 h post-transfection and normalized to protein concentration. Transfections were carried out as described above using expression plasmids (0.5 μg/well) for V5-Miz-1FL and/or FLAG-HCF-1FL. Lysates were prepared 48 h post-transfection using Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (150 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). 1 ml of clarified supernatant, normalized for protein concentration, was precleared with 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and incubated with 1 μg of anti-FLAG antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected, extensively washed, suspended in 50 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel sample buffer, and subjected to PAGE. Proteins were transferred to HybondTM-C pure nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and probed using mouse anti-V5 monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) as the primary antibody, followed by horseradish peroxidase-coupled sheep anti-mouse polyclonal antibody (Amersham Biosciences) as the secondary antibody. Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence with a commercially available kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. COS-1 cells were transfected as described above, except that 1 μg of the various Gal4-Miz-1 expression plasmids was used. Preparation of cell extracts for immunoblotting using HybondTM-C pure nitrocellulose membrane was carried out as described (36$$Google Scholar, 38Meertens L.M. Miyata K.S. Cechetto J.D. Rachubinski R.A. Capone J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6972-6978Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Gal4 fusion proteins were detected by ECL as described above using mouse anti-Gal4 DNA-binding domain monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as the primary antibody and horseradish peroxidase-coupled sheep anti-mouse polyclonal antibody as the secondary antibody. We carried out yeast two-hybrid screens to identify novel HCF-1-interacting proteins that may provide insights into the cellular functions, targets, and mechanisms of action of HCF-1. Similar approaches by others (15Freiman R.N. Herr W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3122-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 16Lu R. Yang P. O'Hare P. Misra V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5117-5126Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) have used the N-terminal domain (residues 1–450) of HCF-1 as bait because this region is known to be sufficient for interaction with VP16 and for promoting VIC formation (14Wilson A.C. Freiman R.N. Goto H. Nishimoto T. Herr W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6139-6146Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We focused our attention on a separate region of HCF-1 (residues 450–1439) that encompasses the basic domain (Fig.1 A) because this region has been shown to be required, along with the HCFVIC domain, to rescue the temperature-sensitive block to cell cycle progression in tsBN67 cells (14Wilson A.C. Freiman R.N. Goto H. Nishimoto T. Herr W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6139-6146Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The rationale was that the basic region may target novel HCF-1-interacting proteins that subserve a role in cell cycle regulation and/or other functions of HCF-1 that are independent of the HCFVIC region. Yeast two-hybrid screens using a Gal4-DBD-HCF-1-(450–1439) fusion protein as bait resulted in the identification"
https://openalex.org/W1996789560,"Yeast ISC1 (Yer019w) encodes inositolphosphosphingolipid-phospholipase C and is activated by phosphatidylserine (PS) and cardiolipin (CL) (Sawai, H., Okamoto, Y., Lubert, C., Mao, C., Bielawska, A., Domae, M., and Hannun, Y. A. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 39793–39798). In this study, the structural requirements for anionic phospholipid-selective binding of ISC1 were determined using site-directed and deletion mutants. FLAG-tagged Isc1p was activated by PS, CL, and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) in a dose-dependent manner. Using lipid-protein overlay assays, Isc1p interacted specifically and directly with PS/CL/PG. Lipid-protein binding studies of a series of deletion mutants demonstrated that the second transmembrane domain (TMII) and the C terminus were required for PS binding. Moreover, the TMII and the C terminus domain were sufficient to impart PS binding to a heterologous protein, green fluorescence protein. In addition, mutations of positively charged amino acid residues at the C terminus of ISC1 reduced the activating effects of PS, suggesting involvement of these amino acids in interaction with PS/CL/PG and in the activation of the enzyme. Finally, when separate fragments containing the N terminus-TMI and TMII-C terminus were expressed heterologously, enzyme activity was reconstituted, demonstrating that the interaction of the N terminus and the C terminus is required for activity of Isc1p. These results raise the hypothesis that in the presence of PS/CL/PG, the catalytic domain in the N terminus of Isc1p is “pulled” to the membrane to interact with substrate. These studies provide unique insights into the properties ofISC1 and define a novel mechanism for activation of enzymes by lipids cofactors. Yeast ISC1 (Yer019w) encodes inositolphosphosphingolipid-phospholipase C and is activated by phosphatidylserine (PS) and cardiolipin (CL) (Sawai, H., Okamoto, Y., Lubert, C., Mao, C., Bielawska, A., Domae, M., and Hannun, Y. A. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 39793–39798). In this study, the structural requirements for anionic phospholipid-selective binding of ISC1 were determined using site-directed and deletion mutants.

The binding of specific proteins to anionic phospholipids in membranes results in conformational changes linked to protein activation and biological responses.

Recently, we reported that ISC1 (YER019w), which has homology to bacterial sphingomyelinase, encodes inositolphosphosphingolipid phospholipase C (15Sawai H. Okamoto Y. Lubert C. Mao C. Bielawska A. Domae M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39793-39798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The activity of Isc1p was completely dependent on anionic phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine (PS) or cardiolipin (CL) (15Sawai H. Okamoto Y. Lubert C. Mao C. Bielawska A. Domae M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39793-39798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The stimulation of the activity by PS was sigmoidal, suggesting that PS interacts cooperatively with Isc1p to stimulate its activity and that Isc1p has at least three to four PS-binding site(s) based on a Hill coefficient of 2–3 (15Sawai H.

However, it is unknown how PS/CL activates Isc1p as the enzyme does not contain a classical C2 domain found in protein kinase C, cytosolic phospholipase A2, and other PS-binding proteins. Therefore, it became important to define anionic phospholipid-selective binding site(s) of Isc1p and the regulatory mechanism of the activation of Isc1p by PS/CL. To identify the structural requirements for anionic phospholipid-selective binding of Isc1p, we generated deletion mutants and a series of point mutations. These results demonstrate that the second transmembrane domain (TMII) and the C terminus are required for PS binding and that the positively charged amino acid residues within the C terminus cooperatively recognize PS. In addition, we demonstrate that the N terminus and the C terminus interact and that this interaction plays a critical role in catalysis by Isc1p. A model for activation of Isc1p by PS/CL/PG is presented and discussed. Anti-FLAG M2 antibody, anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel, FLAG peptide, and fatty acid-free bovine serum were obtained from Sigma.

All the constructs were respectively introduced into ΔISC1 cells as described (15Sawai H. Okamoto Y. Lubert C. Mao C. Bielawska A. Domae M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39793-39798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and gene expression was induced by incubating cells in SC-ura medium plus 2% galactose. Samples for gel electrophoresis were combined with reducing 6× SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. For Western blotting, following separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) containing 5% dried milk. Proteins were then identified by incubating with a 1:2000 dilution of anti-FLAG M2 antibody in 5% dried milk/TBS-T for 1 h. Secondary antibody was diluted 1:4000 into 5% dried milk/TBS-T and incubated for 1 h. Finally, proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) with exposure to Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Lipid-protein overlay assays were performed as described previously (14Jones J.A. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15530-15538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 17Dowler S. Currie R.A. Campbell D.G. Deak M. Kular G. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Equimolar amounts of the indicated lipids from chloroform stocks were spotted onto Hybond C extra nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were allowed to dry under vacuum for 1 h and were then wetted by floating on purified water. The membranes were equilibrated in TBS-T for 5 min, followed by blocking with 3% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin/TBS-T (blocking reagent) for 1 h at room temperature. Yeast cell lysate was diluted into blocking reagent to a final concentration of 2 μg/ml. The membranes were then incubated in the presence of the cell lysate overnight at 4 °C on a rocking platform. The following day the membranes were washed six times for 5 min with TBS-T. All subsequent steps were carried out at room temperature. The protein was then identified by incubating with a 1:2000 dilution of anti-FLAG M2 antibody in blocking reagent for 1 h. This was followed by a second wash step of six times for 5 min with TBS-T. Secondary antibody was diluted 1:4000 into blocking reagent and incubated for 1 h. This was followed by final washes (12 times for 5 min) with TBS-T. Finally, the protein was visualized using ECL (Amersham Biosciences) with exposure to Biomax MR film. Yeast cells were suspended in buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 4 μg/ml each chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin A. Cells were disrupted with glass beads as described (15Sawai H. Okamoto Y. Lubert C. Mao C. Bielawska A. Domae M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39793-39798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Glass beads and cell debris were removed by centrifugation twice at 2,500 ×g for 10 min. Protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Lysates of ISC1-overexpressing cells or GFP were prepared as described above. The lysates was loaded onto anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma), washed with Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl), and eluted with 150 ng/μl of FLAG peptide. The activity of Isc1p was examined as described with modifications (15Sawai H. Okamoto Y. Lubert C. Mao C. Bielawska A. Domae M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39793-39798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates were incubated in 100 μl of buffer containing 100 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 nmol (6.7 mol %) of PS, 10 nmol (6.7 mol %) of unlabeled SM, and 100,000 dpm of [choline-methyl-14C]SM at 30 °C for 30 min. After the incubation, 1.0 ml of chloroform, 0.5 ml of methanol, and 0.2 ml of water were added according to the method of Folch et al. (18Folch J. Leos M. Stanley G.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the radioactivity in a portion (400 μl) of the upper phase was measured by liquid scintillation counting. We have demonstrated previously that Isc1p is stimulated by PS in a dose-dependent manner (15Sawai H. Okamoto Y. Lubert C. Mao C. Bielawska A. Domae M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39793-39798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To demonstrate a physical interaction between Isc1p and anionic phospholipids, binding studies were carried out using the lipid-protein overlay method as described previously (14Jones J.A. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15530-15538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 17Dowler S. Currie R.A. Campbell D.G. Deak M. Kular G. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). By this method, PS and other phospholipids were immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane, and binding was assessed by incubation with purified FLAG-Isc1p protein or yeast cell lysate from cells overexpressing FLAG-ISC1followed by immunostaining with anti-FLAG antibody. Fig.1 demonstrates the binding of Isc1p to PS. As a control for nonspecific binding of protein to lipids, FLAG-tagged GFPuv was used (Fig. 1, a and b). The binding of purified FLAG-Isc1p to PS was very prominent whereas that of FLAG-GFPuv was hardly detectable (Fig. 1 c). Fig.1 c also demonstrates that cell lysates from yeast cells overexpressing FLAG-ISC1 interacted similarly with PS. Therefore, yeast cell lysates were used in subsequent studies. These results suggested that Isc1p may harbor a PS-binding domain. To evaluate whether other phospholipids are able to interact with Isc1p, the activity of Isc1p using various concentrations of different phospholipids was determined. As shown in Fig.2 a, FLAG-Isc1p was stimulated by PS, CL, PG, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidic acid, but not phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine, suggesting that anionic phospholipids activate Isc1p. Fig. 2 b shows that using yeast cell lysate from FLAG-ISC1-overexpressing cells, FLAG-Isc1p bound specifically to the anionic phospholipids PS, CL, or PG. FLAG-Isc1p also interacted, but weakly, with phosphatidylinositol or phosphatidic acid and did not bind phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine. These results support the kinetic data (Fig.2 a) and suggest that Isc1p can interact with anionic phospholipids with a clear preference for PG, PS, and CL. Therefore, PS was used in subsequent studies. To determine whether there is a discrete PS-binding domain in Isc1p, deletion mutants were constructed (Fig.3) and tested. Fig. 3 b shows a representative Western blot analysis of the deletion mutants, and the level of expression of all mutants was noticeably similar. The results of lipid-protein overlay assays with the deletion mutants are show in Fig. 3 c. A dramatic decrease in the binding to PS was observed for 377-stop (Isc1p lacking TMI, TMII, and C terminus), and a moderate decrease was seen with 450-stop (lacking only the C terminus) compared with the wild-type full-length FLAG-Isc1p. On the other hand, the binding of an N terminus deletion mutant to PS was similar to wild-type. Isc1p contains a domain with homology to P-loops, domains found in nucleotide-binding proteins (19Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofen A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). A P-loop truncation deletion mutant (162–169) also bound PS with similar intensity to wild-type protein. These results suggest that the TMs and the C terminus, but not the N terminus or the P-loop, are required for anionic phospholipid-selective binding. Fig. 3 d indicates the effects of these mutants on activity of Isc1p. The 377-stop, 450-stop, or P-loop truncation mutants lost activity completely. Noticeably the P-loop deletion lost activity but not PS binding. These results show that although the activity of Isc1p requires multiple domains, the interaction with PS (activation and binding) is determined primarily by the TMs and the C terminus. Next, to determine whether there is a domain in Isc1p sufficient to bind PS, a series of FLAG-tagged GFP fusion proteins were constructed and examined. These fusion proteins, consisting of different fragments ofISC1 attached to FLAG-tagged GFP, were expressed in ΔISC1 cells, and a schematic diagram of the constructs is shown in Fig. 4 a. Fig.4 b shows a representative Western blot analysis of the GFP fusion proteins, and the level of expression of all GFP fusion proteins was found to be consistently higher than the wild-type. The results of lipid-protein overlay assays with GFP fusion proteins are shown in Fig.4 c. Modest binding to PS was observed for FLAG-GFP+C terminus (C terminus fragment of ISC1) compared with the FLAG-GFP, which did not show significant binding. On the other hand, the binding of FLAG-GFP-TMII-C terminus (TMII and C terminus fragment of ISC1) to PS was robust, although somewhat weaker compared with FLAG-Isc1p. These results suggest that the anionic phospholipid-selective-binding domain is localized primarily to TMII and the C terminus. As the above results defined a minimum domain that was necessary and sufficient for PS binding, we searched the database for possible similar motifs. As shown in Fig.5 a, ISC1 appeared to contain a motif first identified in the classical PKCs and shown to be present in PS decarboxylases, and in PLA1, which acts specifically on PS as a substrate (20Igarashi K. Kaneda M. Yamaji A. Saido T.C. Kikkawa U. Ono Y. Inoue K. Umeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29075-29078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this motif was not discovered when the whole sequence of ISC1 was searched but only with the TMI-C terminus domain. Moreover, this domain contains a number of conserved positively charged amino acids that are therefore candidates for binding the negatively charged PS (21Buckland A.G. Wilton D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 199-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To test the role of these positively charged amino acid residues in the regulation of ISC1 by PS, we investigated the effects of mutating these amino acids on PS regulation of Isc1p using site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 5 b). Fig.5 c shows a representative Western blot analysis of the C terminus mutants, and the level of expression of mutants was found to be similar. Next, the effects of these positively charged amino acid residues on PS regulation of Isc1p were investigated using kinetic analysis of activation by PS. It should be noted that overlay assays proved inadequate to distinguish quantitative effects on binding and therefore was not utilized in these studies. Fig. 5 d shows activity of Isc1p at various concentrations of PS. A dramatic decrease of activity was observed for R454A compared with FLAG-Isc1p. On the other hand, a significant but less pronounced decrease of activity was observed for R450A, H468A/H469A, and K477A compared with FLAG-Isc1p. The activity of H468A/H469A/K477A was similar to H468A/H469A, but R450A/R454A/K477A abolished the activity. The activity of H468A/H469A, K477A, or H468A/H469A/K477A was S-shaped, and the Hill coefficient of activation of these mutants by PS was similar to FLAG-Isc1p (∼4). The activation of R450A or R454A by PS was decreased significantly. The Hill coefficient of R450A and R454A were 3.9 and 2.3, respectively. These results suggested that the cooperativity with PS of R454A decreased. These results suggested that Arg-450 and Arg-454 are the primary amino acids involved in the activating effects of PS/CL/PG. The above results with the P-loop deletion indicated that the N terminus is required for the activity of Isc1p but not PS binding (Fig. 3), suggesting that the amino “domain” of the enzyme harbors the catalytic site. On the other hand, the above results identify a carboxyl domain that is required for interaction with PS/CL/PG and for activation of the enzyme by these lipids. These results suggested the hypothesis that the function of the carboxyl domain is perhaps to interact with the amino domain, such that when the carboxyl domain binds PS/CL/PG, it is then able to position the catalytic domain to access substrates. Therefore, to examine whether the N- and the C-domains interact, we expressed N terminus-TMI and TMII-C terminus in separate plasmids in ΔISC1 cells. All deletion mutant constructs are shown in Fig.6 a. Fig. 6 b shows a representative Western blot analysis of the deletion mutants, and the expected bands of all deletion mutants were observed. When 422-stop and FLAG-GFP-TMII-C terminus were expressed together, both bands were observed. Expression of 422-stop (N terminus-TMI), FLAG-TMII-C terminus, or FLAG-GFP-TMII-C terminus separately did not demonstrate any enzyme activity. On the other hand, when 422-stop and FLAG-TMII-C terminus or FLAG-GFP-TMII-C terminus were expressed in combination, the activity was reconstituted, suggesting that the interaction of the N terminus and the C terminus is be required for activity of Isc1p. The results of this study demonstrated that Isc1p is capable of interacting with anionic phospholipids, especially PS, CL, and PG. The results define a discrete domain in Isc1p composed of the second transmembrane domain and the carboxyl terminus that functions as anionic phospholipid-selective binding domain. Our studies show that this domain is both necessary and sufficient for binding of PS and for imparting PS-dependent stimulation of activity. The results also pinpoint two major cationic amino acids in this domain that are necessary for the cooperative activation of Isc1p by PS. Finally, the results suggest a mechanism by which the anionic phospholipid-selective binding carboxyl domain activates the enzyme by interacting with the catalytic domain. Recently, the motif FXFXLKXXXKXR found in the C2 domain of classical PKCs, in PS decarboxylases, and in PS-PLA1 was defined based on the ability of an anti-idiotypic antibody raised against the combining site of a PS-specific antibody to interact with PKC (20Igarashi K.

Interestingly, residues 446–454 (FLFGRSEIR) found in the membrane-proximal C terminus of Isc1p are similar to this putative PS-binding motif. However, Johnson et al. (21Buckland A.G. Wilton D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 199-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) reported that this motif is not involved in regulation of PKCβII by lipids using site-directed mutagenesis. In addition, Verdaguer et al.(22Johnson J.E. Edwards A.S. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30787-30792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) showed that PS binding of PKC relied upon completely different residues. Moreover, the situation with PKC is more complicated by the fact that both the C1 and C2 domain interact with anionic phospholipids but perhaps with different specificities (23Verdaguer N. Corbalan-Garcia S. Ochoa W.F. Fita I. Gómez- Fernández J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6329-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 24Newton A.C. Johnson J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Taken together, our observations suggest that this motif is essential for interaction with PS/CL/PG and not only PS. Thus, the specificity of the interaction of the other proteins that contain this motif with anionic phospholipid should be examined and determined. Moreover, it has been shown that positively charged amino acid residue(s) play significant roles in some cases of protein-anionic phospholipids interactions. A number of positively charged amino acid residues of DnaA have been implicated by mutagenesis as being involved in binding to anionic phospholipids such as CL (25Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32407-32410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 26Makise M. Mima S. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7450-7456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Five positively charged amino acid residues (Arg-450, Arg-454, His-468, His-469, and Lys-477) are found in the C terminus of Isc1p. Our site-directed mutagenesis studies indicated that the co-substitution of Arg-450 and Arg-454 with alanine results in significant loss of PS activation of Isc1p and in complete loss of cooperativity of interaction (Fig. 5), suggesting that these two positively charged amino acid residues are critical for the activating effects of PS/CL/PG. Although we did not evaluate the role of the amino-terminal hydrophobic residues (Phe-446 and Phe-448), these Phe residues or other hydrophobic amino acid residues within the TMII may be involved in recognizing the hydrophobic tail of PS/CL/PG, because the TMII is necessary for the binding of Isc1p to PS (Fig. 4). The results from this study also demonstrated an essential role for the P-loop-like domain in the amino terminus in catalysis but not in binding to PS. Together with the results showing that the C terminus is required for both binding of PS and activation by PS (Fig. 3), we wondered whether the two domains of the enzyme interact. Thus, when the two separate fragments N terminus-TMI and TMII-C terminus were co-expressed, activity was reconstituted (Fig. 6), suggesting that the interaction of the N terminus and the C terminus is required for activity of Isc1p. Interestingly, a cluster of negative charged amino acid resides is found in the C terminus downstream to Arg-450, Arg-454 (residues 458–467). On the other hand, a cluster of positively charged amino acid resides is found downstream to the catalytic domain in the N terminus (residues 382–398). Therefore, it is possible that these regions interact via electrostatic interactions. These mechanisms are under investigation. Fig. 7 shows a proposed molecular mechanism for how PS/CL/PG stimulates Isc1p activity. We propose that in the presence of PS/CL/PG, the TMII and the proximal C terminus (anionic phospholipid-selective binding domain) associates with membranes via tethering to anionic phospholipids. As a consequence of this tethering and the interaction of the amino and carboxyl domains of the enzyme, the catalytic domain in the N terminus of Isc1p is pulled to the membrane to interact with lipid substrates. One possible prediction of this model is that colocalization of Isc1p and PS/CL/PG might be critical for the activation of Isc1p. In conclusion, these results define a novel domain composed of one transmembrane domain (TMII) and the C terminus that is required for anionic phospholipid-selective binding. This domain contains a conserved motif that is required for PS/CL/PG binding with a critical role for positively charged amino acids that cooperatively recognize PS/CL/PG. In addition, we demonstrate that the N terminus and the C terminus interact, and that this interaction plays a critical role in catalysis by Isc1p. These studies provide unique insights into the properties of ISC1 and define a novel mechanism for activation of enzymes by lipids cofactors. We thank Dr. Korey R. Johnson and Kevin P.

Based on N-terminal and internal amino acid sequences, a 535-bp DNA fragment corresponding to a portion of the isonitrile hydratase gene was amplified, which was used as a probe to clone a 6.4-kb DNA fragment containing the whole gene. Sequence analysis of the 6.4-kb fragment revealed that the isonitrile hydratase gene (inhA) was 684 nucleotides long and encoded a protein with a molecular mass of 24,211 Da. Overexpression of inhA in Escherichia coligave a large amount of soluble isonitrile hydratase exhibiting the same molecular and catalytic properties as the native enzyme from thePseudomonas strain. The predicted amino acid sequence ofinhA showed low similarity to that of an intracellular protease in Pyrococcus horikoshii (PH1704), and an active cysteine residue in the protease was conserved in the isonitrile hydratase at the corresponding position (Cys-101). A mutant enzyme containing Ala instead of Cys-101 did not exhibit isonitrile hydratase activity at all, demonstrating the essential role of this residue in the catalytic function.

An isonitrile (more generally called an isocyanide) is a highly toxic compound with an isocyano group (-N≡C). The isonitriles form the only class of organic compounds that contain a stable, formally mono-coordinated carbon, cf. carbon monoxide (1Edenborough M.S. Herbert R.B. Natl. Prod. Rep. 1988; 5: 229-245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The isocyano group exhibits the unusual characteristic that it reacts with nucleophiles and electrophiles on the same carbon atom of the functional group, which has been exploited for synthetic applications (1Edenborough M.S. Herbert R.B. Natl. Prod. Rep. 1988; 5: 229-245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); in particular, isocyanide-based multicomponent reactions are a powerful tool for the one-pot synthesis of diverse and complex compounds and are being increasingly used for the discovery of new drugs and agrochemicals (2Dömling A. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 3Dömling A. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 4Dömling A. Ugi I. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2000; 39: 3168-3210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, naturally occurring isonitriles have so far been discovered in various organisms, including bacteria, fungi, marine sponges, etc. The first report of an isocyanide metabolite, xanthocillin, which was isolated from Penicillium notatum, was published in 1957 (5Hagedorn I. Tönjes H. Pharmazie. 1957; 12: 567-580PubMed Google Scholar). An indoleacryloisocyanide was isolated fromPseudomonas NCIB 11237 through screening for antibiotic compounds produced by bacteria (6Evans J.R. Napier E.J. Yates P. J. Antibiot. 1976; 29: 850-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The isonitriles that are elaborated by marine organisms, such as axisonitrile-1 (7Cafieri F. Fattorusso E. Magno S. Santacroce C. Sica D. Tetrahedron. 1973; 29: 4259-4262Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and 9-isocyanopupukeanane (8Burreson B.J. Scheuer P.J. Finer J. Clardy J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1975; 97: 4763-4764Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar), form the largest group of naturally occurring isonitriles. A lot of other reports on the structures and biological activities of natural isocyanides have also been published (for reviews, see Refs. 1Edenborough M.S. Herbert R.B. Natl. Prod. Rep. 1988; 5: 229-245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 9Scheuer P.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 1992; 25: 433-439Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, information on their metabolism is quite limited. Although parts of the metabolic intermediates of some isonitriles have been elucidated through incorporation experiments (10Hagadone M.R. Scheuer P.J. Holm A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 2447-2448Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11Achenbach H. Grisebach H. Z. Naturforsch. 1965; 20B: 137-140Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 12Achenbach H. König F. Chem.

Moreover, none of the enzymes involved in isonitrile metabolism, except for our enzyme described below, has yet been identified, and no analyses at the gene level have been performed. We have extensively studied (14Kobayashi M. Shimizu S. Nature Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 15Yamada H. Kobayashi M. Biosci. Biotechnol.

Biochem. 1999; 261: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) the enzymes (i.e.nitrilase, nitrile hydratase, and amidase) involved in the metabolism of nitriles, which are isomers of isonitriles, and therefore are interested in the differences between the metabolism of nitriles and that of isonitriles. Recently, we isolated a microorganism that is able to degrade isonitriles, sp. N19–2, from soil and identified it asPseudomonas putida. In this strain, we discovered a novel enzyme that catalyzes the hydration of an isonitrile to the corresponding N-substituted formamide and named it isonitrile hydratase (20Goda M. Hashimoto Y. Shimizu S. Kobayashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23480-23485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It has been approved as a new enzyme by NC-IUBMB; EC 4.2.1.103. Among known enzymes, only nitrogenase has been reported to act on an isonitrile; it converts methyl isocyanide to the corresponding amine (21Kelly M. Postgate J.R. Richards R.L. Biochem. J. 1967; 102: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 22Rubinson J.F. Corbin J.L. Burgess B.K. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 6260-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, isonitriles are not physiological substrates of the enzyme, and there is no evidence that it is involved in the metabolism of isonitriles in vivo. Therefore, our work on the isonitrile hydratase is the first on an enzyme involved in the metabolism of isocyano compounds. In the present study, for the first time, we cloned an isonitrile hydratase gene (inhA) from P. putida N19–2 and constructed an Escherichia coli transformant overexpressing InhA. We report the interesting sequence similarity between the isonitrile hydratase and an intracellular protease in Pyrococcus horikoshii (PH1704). We also attempted to identify its active amino acid by site-directed mutagenesis and obtained evidence that a cysteine residue (Cys-101) plays an important role in the catalytic mechanism of isonitrile hydratase. P. putida N19–2 was isolated previously from soil (20Goda M. Hashimoto Y. Shimizu S. Kobayashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23480-23485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). E. coli DH10B (Invitrogen) was used as the host for pUC plasmids (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).E. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL (Novagen) was used as the host for a plasmid, pET-21a(+) (Novagen), and its derivative and was also used for expression of the isonitrile hydratase gene (inhA). E. coli transformants were grown in 2× YT medium (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The isonitrile hydratase was purified from P. putida N19–2 as described previously (20Goda M. Hashimoto Y. Shimizu S. Kobayashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23480-23485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and its N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined by automated Edman degradation with an Applied Biosystems model 470A gas-phase amino acid sequencer (Foster City, CA). To determine its internal sequences, the purified enzyme was digested with lysyl endopeptidase (Wako Pure Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan) in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9.0) at 37 °C for 6 h. The reaction mixture was applied to a Smart System (reversed-phase chromatography; Amersham Biosciences) on a μRPC C2.1/10 column and eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile (0–80%) (v/v) in the presence of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. The peptide fragments isolated were sequenced by automated Edman degradation. Genomic DNA was prepared from P. putida N19–2 as follows: P. putida N19–2 was cultured at 28 °C for 12 h in 20 ml of LB medium (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with reciprocal shaking. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with Tris/EDTA buffer (50 mm Tris/50 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)), and then suspended in 1.5 ml of Tris/EDTA buffer containing 15% (w/v) sucrose. Then 1.5 ml of Tris/EDTA buffer containing 1% (w/v) sodiumN-lauroylsarcosine was added to the cell suspension, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The solution was subjected to equilibrium centrifugation in a CsCl-ethidium bromide gradient, and the fraction containing genomic DNA was pooled, extracted with n-butanol to remove ethidium bromide, and then dialyzed against 10 mm Tris/1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). An oligonucleotide sense primer (23-mer, 512 variants, 5′TTYCCICARGTNCARCARYTNGA-3′; I = deoxyinosine) and an antisense primer (26-mer, 512 variants, 5′-TCRAAIGGIGGNGCNGGNGCRTAYTC-3′) were synthesized based on the N-terminal (FPQVQQLD) and internal amino acid (EYAPAPPFD) sequences of the enzyme, respectively. A reaction mixture (50 μl) comprising 10 ng of genomic DNA, 300 pmol of each primer, and Ex Taqpolymerase (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan) was subjected to PCR (94 °C for 30 s, 45 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 60 s; 30 cycles), and the amplified DNA fragment (535 bp) was gel-purified. The DNA fragment was then used as a probe for Southern hybridization and colony hybridization to clone the full-length isonitrile hydratase gene (inhA). Southern hybridization was carried out using an Alkphos direct labeling and detection system with CDP-Star (Amersham Biosciences) according to the procedure recommended by the supplier. Colony hybridization was carried out as follows: the recombinant colonies were transferred to a nylon membrane, lysed with denaturing buffer (0.5m NaOH, 1.5 m NaCl, 0.1% SDS) for 15 min, and then treated with neutralizing buffer (1 m Tris/HCl, 1.5m NaCl (pH 7.5)) for 5 min and 2× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15m NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate) for 15 min, successively. After DNA fixation by UV cross-linking, the membrane was washed in 3× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 68 °C for 3 h and then hybridization was carried out with the same system as used for Southern hybridization. Nucleotides were sequenced by the dideoxy-chain terminating method using an ABI Prism 310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The coding sequence of the enzyme (inhA) was amplified by PCR with pINH10 as a template. The following two oligonucleotide primers were used: sense primer, 5′-CATATGGCGTTGCAGATCGGTTTTC-3′ containing aNdeI recognition site (underlined) and 22 nucleotides ofinhA starting with the ATG start codon (nucleotides 29–50 in Fig. 1); antisense primer, 5′-GAATTCTCAGCGCAGATTGAGCTTCGC-3′ containing anEcoRI recognition site (underlined) and 21 nucleotides that are complementary to the 3′-end sequence of inhA ending with the TGA stop codon (nucleotides 695–715 in Fig. 1). The amplified DNA was subcloned into vector pUC18 and checked by DNA sequencing. The insert DNA was digested with NdeI and EcoRI and then inserted into the respective sites of pET-21a(+). The resultant plasmid was designated as pET-inhA; in this construction,inhA was under the control of the T7 promoter. E. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL was transformed with pET-inhA, and the recombinant cells were used for the overproduction and purification of isonitrile hydratase. The transformed cells were incubated with reciprocal shaking at 37 °C in 20 ml of 2× YT medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. After overnight cultivation, the entire culture was inoculated into 2 liters of the same medium, followed by incubation with shaking at 37 °C for 2 h. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 0, 0.01, 0.1, or 1 mm to induce the T7 promoter, and further cultivation was carried out at 37 °C for 4 or 12 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 10% (v/v) glycerol, and then disrupted by sonication (Insonator Model 201 m; Kubota, Tokyo, Japan) to prepare a cell-free extract. The recombinant enzyme was partially purified from this extract through ammonium sulfate fractionation and DEAE-Sephacel column chromatography, by the same procedure as used for the purification of isonitrile hydratase from P. putidaN19–2 (20Goda M. Hashimoto Y. Shimizu S. Kobayashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23480-23485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Then the enzyme solution was applied to a Resource Q column (6.4 × 30 mm) equilibrated with 10 mm buffer, which was attached to an ÄKTA purifier (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted by increasing the ionic strength of KCl in a linear manner from 0 to 0.3 m. The active fractions were pooled, precipitated with 70% saturated ammonium sulfate, and then dialyzed against 10 mm buffer. Site-directed mutagenesis (converting Cys-101 to Ala, Thr-102 to Ala, Glu-79 to Gln, and Glu-81 to Gln, respectively) was carried out on inhA by means of an overlap extension PCR protocol (24Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar, 25Pogulis R.J. Yallejo A.N. Pease L.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 167-176PubMed Google Scholar). To construct the C101A mutant, two PCRs, with plasmid pET-inhA as the template, were performed with primer pairs C101A-S plus T7T and T7P plus C101A-AS (Table I). These reactions produced 3′ and 5′ fragments of inhA, respectively, whose sequences overlapped by 24 bp at the mutation. The second round of PCR was performed by mixing equimolar amounts of the first-round products and amplifying between primers T7P and T7T to produce the full-length inhA. The second-round product was digested with NdeI and EcoRI, ligated into expression vector pET-21a(+), and then sequenced. A clone with the sequence for the desired C101A mutation was chosen and transformed intoE. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL. The recombinant cells were used for the overproduction and purification of the C101A mutant enzyme. The T102A, E79Q, and E81Q mutations were constructed in the same manner as the C101A mutation, with the internal primer pairs T102A-S plus T102A-AS, E79Q-S plus E79Q-AS, and E81Q-S plus E81Q-AS, respectively (Table I).Table IOligonucleotide primers used for the preparation of mutant isonitrile hydratasesNameSequencePositionT7P :5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′T7T :5′-GCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGG-3′C101A-S :5′-GTTACGTCGGTTGCGACCGGTTCGCTTGTG-3′317–346C101A-AS:5′-CGAACCGGTCGCAACCGACGTAACGTACCG-3′311–340T102A-S :5′-TCGGTTTGCGCCGGTTCGCTTGTGCTTGGC-3′323–352T102A-AS:5′-CACAAGCGAACCGGCGCAAACCGACGTAAC-3′317–346E79Q-S :5′-GGGCCGTTGATGCAGGATGAGCAGACGCTG-3′251–280E79Q-AS :5′-CTGCTCATCCTGCATCAACGGCCCGACCCC-3′245–274E81Q-S :5′-TTGATGGAGGATCAGCAGACGCTGGACTTC-3′257–286E81Q-AS :5′-GTCCAGCGTCTGCTGATCCTCCATCAACGG-3′254–283Bold letters indicate the nucleotides changed for the desired mutations.

Shimizu S. Kobayashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23480-23485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). One unit of isonitrile hydratase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1 μmol N-cyclohexylformamide/min from cyclohexyl isocyanide under the standard experimental conditions. The protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar). The specific activity is expressed as units/mg of protein. SDS-PAGE was performed in a 12.5% polyacrylamide slab gel according to Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207523) Google Scholar). The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The molecular mass of the enzyme subunit was determined from the relative mobilities of marker proteins, phosphorylase b (94 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (30 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (20.1 kDa), and α-lactalbumin (14.4 kDa). CD measurements were carried out with an Aviv model 62A DS spectrometer (Aviv Instrument, Lakewood, NJ) at 20 °C with a 1-mm lightpath cell. The CD spectra were obtained at the protein concentration of 0.2 mg/ml in the far UV region (200–260 nm). Isonitrile hydratase was purified to homogeneity fromP. putida N19–2, and the amino acid sequences of peptides were determined by digesting the enzyme with lysyl endopeptidase. Two oligonucleotide primers were synthesized based on the N-terminal and internal sequences (corresponding to amino acids 10–17 and 180–188 in Fig. 1, respectively) and used for PCR amplification with genomic DNA of P. putida N19–2 as a template, resulting in the generation of a 535-bp fragment. The deduced amino acid sequence of the amplified fragment was consistent with the internal sequences of the enzyme determined by Edman degradation, indicating that the fragment was a portion of the enzyme gene. To obtain the entire isonitrile hydratase gene, after digestion of the genomic DNA with several restriction enzymes, Southern hybridization was performed using the 535-bp fragment as a probe. A single 6.4-kbSalI fragment was positively detected, and this fragment was recovered and ligated with SalI-digested pUC18 to transformE. coli DH10B. After screening of the recombinant plasmids by colony hybridization, a positive clone, designated as pINH10, was obtained. The nucleotide sequencing of pINH10 revealed a 684-bp open reading frame encoding 228 amino acids (Fig. 1), which corresponded precisely to those determined with the purified isonitrile hydratase. The molecular mass of the protein encoded by this gene (inhA) was calculated to be 24,211 Da, which was a little bit different from that of the enzyme subunit (molecular mass = 29 kDa) determined on SDS-PAGE (20Goda M. Hashimoto Y. Shimizu S. Kobayashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23480-23485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This discrepancy may be explained by the unusual mobility of the enzyme protein on SDS-PAGE, which was caused by its small SDS binding capacity, because some proteins exhibit greater resistance to binding than others (28Nelson C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3895-3901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A typical Shine-Dalgarno sequence was present 6 bp upstream from the initiation codon, but none of the consensus promoter sequences were observed in the upstream region. There was a palindromic sequence (ΔG = −41.9 kcal/mol) just downstream the termination codon, which seemed to be a putative transcriptional termination signal. A search of protein sequence databases with the BLAST server revealed that isonitrile hydratase exhibits significant similarity to several ThiJ/PfpI family proteins, e.g. a putative protein inNostoc sp. PCC 7120 (DDBJ BAB771641; 54% identity), two putative proteins in Caulobacter crescentus CB15 (GenBankTMAAK24921.1 and AAK23756.1; 51 and 46% identity, respectively), a putative AraC-type transcriptional regulator in Methanosarcina mazei Goe1 (GenBankTMAAM33006.1; 40% identity), and a putative 4-methyl-5-(β-hydroxyethyl)-thiazole monophosphate biosynthesis enzyme in Mycobacterium tuberculosis CDC1551 (GenBankTMAAK44280.1; 40% identity). Isonitrile hydratase also showed sequence similarity to the intracellular proteases fromP. horikoshii (PH1704) (Swiss-Prot O59413; 24% identity) (29Kawarabayasi Y. Sawada M. Horikawa H. Haikawa Y. Hino Y. Yamamoto S. Sekine M. Baba S. Kosugi H. Hosoyama A. Nagai Y. Sakai M. Ogura K. Otsuka R. Nakazawa H. Takamiya M. Ohfuku Y. Funahashi T. Tanaka T. Kudoh Y. Yamazaki J. Kushida N. Oguchi A.

DNA Res. 1998; 5: 55-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar) and Pyrococcus furiosus (PfpI) (Swiss-ProtQ51732; 24% identity) (30Halio S.B. Blumentals I.I. Short S.A. Merrill B.M. Kelly R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2605-2612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although the similarities were very low. Recently, the crystal structure of PH1704 was solved (31Du X. Choi I.G. Kim R. Wang W. Jancarik J. Yokota H. Kim S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14079-14084Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Judging from the three-dimensional structural information, Cys-100 must be the active site nucleophile, which comprises a catalytic triad with His-101 and Glu-74 (of an adjacent monomer) in PH1704. The active Cys-100 in PH1704 was conserved at the corresponding position in isonitrile hydratase (Cys-101) (Fig. 2). Therefore, we investigated the catalytic role of Cys-101 in isonitrile hydratase by means of site-directed mutagenesis. The residues (i.e.Thr-102 and Glu-79/Glu-81 in isonitrile hydratase) that correspond to His-101 and Glu-74 in PH1704 were also investigated (see below). To overproduce isonitrile hydratase in E. coli, the coding sequence (inhA) was inserted between the NdeI and EcoRI sites of pET-21a(+), resulting in pET-inhA, in which the isonitrile hydratase gene was under the control of the T7 promoter. When E. coli harboring pET-inhA was cultured in the presence of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, isonitrile hydratase activity was observed in the cell-free extract. The maximum level of isonitrile hydratase activity was 5.23 units/mg (TableII); this value corresponded to 31.7% of the specific activity (16.5 units/mg: 100%) of the isonitrile hydratase purified from P. putida N19–2 (20Goda M. Hashimoto Y. Shimizu S. Kobayashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23480-23485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We analyzed the cell-free extract by SDS-PAGE and detected a 29-kDa protein band corresponding to the subunit of the P. putida N19–2 enzyme. Therefore, hyperproduction of isonitrile hydratase in the active form was attained. We also examined other host-vector systems (such as pUC plasmids and E. coli JM109) to increase the production of isonitrile hydratase but with none of the transformants was the enzyme activity more than 5.23 units/mg in the cell-free extract (data not shown). Thus, we used the combination of pET-inhA andE. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL in the following studies.Table IIIsonitrile hydratase activities of E. coli transformants under various culture conditionsCultivation timeIPTG concentrationSpecific activityhmmunits/mg401.301200.5640.011.41120.013.3840.13.96120.15.23411.561210.91Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to 2× YT medium at the same time as the culture was started. Open table in a new tab Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to 2× YT medium at the same time as the culture was started. The isonitrile hydratase produced in the recombinant cells was purified to homogeneity through ammonium sulfate fractionation and two-step column chromatography procedures (Fig. 3,lane 1). The purified enzyme exhibited almost the same specific activity (17.3 units/mg; TableIII) as the P. putida N19–2 enzyme.Table IIISpecific activities of the wild-type and mutant isonitrile hydratasesEnzymeSpecific activityRelative activityunits/mg%Wild type17.3100E79Q18.7108E81Q15.489C101ANDaNot detected.0T102A1.418.2a Not detected. Open table in a new tab We constructed four mutants of isonitrile hydratase by site-directed mutagenesis, converting Cys-101 to Ala (C101A), Thr-102 to Ala (T102A), Glu-79 to Gln (E79Q), and Glu-81 to Gln (E81Q), respectively. Cys-101 is the amino acid residue that corresponds to Cys-100 in PH1704, whereas Thr-102 corresponds to His-101 in PH1704 (Fig. 2). Instead of Gly-75 (which actually corresponds to Glu-74 in PH1704), Glu-79 was selected as a candidate for the active amino acid residue, because the glycine residue did not seem to be involved in the catalytic mechanism, and Glu-79 is the glutamate residue closest to Gly-75 (Fig. 2). Glu-81 was also selected, because it is located near Gly-75 and is the only conserved glutamate residue in the overall sequence. Each of the mutant enzymes was expressed in E. coli, purified to homogeneity (Fig. 3,lanes 2–5) according to the same procedure as used for the wild-type enzyme, and then characterized. The specific activities of the mutant enzymes are shown in Table III. The C101A mutant exhibited no detectable isonitrile hydratase activity at all, even when a large amount of enzyme (over 200 times as much as usually used for assaying of the wild-type enzyme) was added to the reaction mixture. The T102A mutant exhibited a reduction of >90% in activity. On the other hand, the E79Q and E81Q mutants exhibited almost the same specific activity as the wild-type enzyme. The circular dichroism spectra of these four mutants were very similar to that of the parental enzyme; particularly those of the C101A mutant and the T102A mutant were almost identical to that of the wild-type enzyme, and those of the E79Q mutant and the E81Q mutant were a little bit above that of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 4). These findings indicate that essentially no major change in the overall conformation of the enzyme protein was induced by the mutations. The native molecular mass of each mutant determined by gel-permeation chromatography (data not shown) was also similar to that of the wild-type enzyme, suggesting that the subunit composition was not altered (i.e. homodimer (20Goda M. Hashimoto Y. Shimizu S. Kobayashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23480-23485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)). These findings demonstrate that Cys-101 and Thr-102 are important for catalytic activity, whereas Glu-79 and Glu-81 are not. An isonitrile is a compound with an NC functional group that possesses an unusual valence structure and reactivity. Based on its unique reactivity, i.e. the α-addition of nucleophiles and electrophiles at the same isocyanide carbon, many synthetically useful methods have been developed (1Edenborough M.S. Herbert R.B. Natl. Prod. Rep. 1988; 5: 229-245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among them, isocyanide-based multicomponent reactions are by far the most versatile and are receiving increasing attention, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry; they have become popular reactions for the preparation of a drug-like compound library (4Dömling A. Ugi I. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2000; 39: 3168-3210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, many natural isonitriles have been isolated from various organisms. Most of them show a strong antibiotic effect and have potential as possible agents of practical use, e.g. a series of isocyanoterpenes, isolated from marine sponges, exhibit antimalarial activities (32Angerhofer C.K.

Chem. 1997; 1: 127-152Google Scholar). However, no investigation of isonitrile metabolism at the protein or gene level was performed. Theref"
https://openalex.org/W2044606874,"Large T-antigen (T-ag) is a viral helicase required for the initiation and elongation of simian virus 40 DNA replication. The unwinding activity of the helicase is powered by ATP hydrolysis and is critically dependent on the oligomeric state of the protein. We confirmed that the double hexamer is the active form of the helicase on synthetic replication forks. In contrast, the single hexamer cannot unwind synthetic forks and remains bound to the DNA as ATP is hydrolyzed. This inability of the T-ag single hexamer to release the DNA fork is the likely explanation for its poor helicase activity. We characterized the interactions of T-ag single and double hexamers with synthetic forks and single-stranded (ss) DNA. We demonstrated that DNA forks promote the formation of T-ag double hexamer. The lengths of the duplex region and the 3′ tail of the synthetic forks are the critical factors in assembly of the double hexamer, which is bound to a single fork. We found that the cooperativity of T-ag binding to ss oligonucleotides increased with DNA length, suggesting that multiple consecutive subunits in the hexamer engage the ssDNA.

We found that the cooperativity of T-ag binding to ss oligonucleotides increased with DNA length, suggesting that multiple consecutive subunits in the hexamer engage the ssDNA. DNA helicases are ubiquitous enzymes that function as cellular motors to unwind DNA duplexes at the expense of NTP hydrolysis (1Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Google Scholar). Helicases must not only bind to DNA but also translocate along it. Translocation involves a series of binding and release events during which helicases cycle between DNA binding states varying in affinity using steps in the NTP hydrolysis cycle as “switches.” Helicases translocate unidirectionally along ssDNA. 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; AMP-PNP, adenylyl imidodiphosphate; nt, nucleotide(s); OBD- origin DNA binding domain, T-ag, T-antigen; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; oligo, oligonucleotide. This directionality is also intrinsic to their unwinding activity and is revealed by a tight association to only one of the product single strands. Two general groups of helicases are thus distinguished: 3′→5′ and 5′→3′. Helicases are also classified according to their quaternary structure as monomeric, dimeric, and hexameric. Hexameric helicases form rings around DNA and function primarily in replication. Simian virus 40 (SV40) T-antigen (T-ag) is a 3′→5′-hexameric helicase (2Stahl H. Droge P. Knippers R. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1939-1944Google Scholar, 3Bullock P.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 503-568Google Scholar, 4Simmons D.T. Adv. Virus Res. 2000; 55: 75-134Google Scholar). Its essential role in DNA replication depends on its ability to bind specifically to the SV40 origin of replication and subsequently to power bi-directional unwinding via its helicase activity. Thus, as in other well studied DNA replication programs, the origin recognition and helicase loading steps may be studied separately. In the case of SV40 a single protein is responsible for all of these reactions. An initiation complex at the origin assembles through the binding of T-ag monomers to precisely spaced and oriented GAGGC repeats (5Mastrangelo I.A. Hough P.V. Wall J.S. Dodson M. Dean F.B. Hurwitz J. Nature. 1989; 338: 658-662Google Scholar, 6Deb S.P. Tegtmeyer P. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3649-3654Google Scholar, 7Cohen G.L. Wright P.J. DeLucia A.L. Lewton B.A. Anderson M.E. Tegtmeyer P. J. Virol. 1984; 51: 91-96Google Scholar). T-ag hexamers can also form in the absence of DNA, but these cannot load productively onto origin-containing duplex fragments (8Dean F.B. Borowiec J.A. Eki T. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14129-14137Google Scholar). The pre-replication origin complex consists of two bound T-ag hexamers in a head-to-head orientation (9Valle M. Gruss C. Halmer L. Carazo J.M. Donate L.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 34-41Google Scholar). Once unwinding starts from the origin, the two T-ag hexamers could remain attached to one another or separate and move away from each other. Evidence for both scenarios has been obtained by electron microscopy (EM) of in vitro unwinding intermediates (10Wessel R. Schweizer J. Stahl H. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 804-815Google Scholar). The finding of unwinding intermediates with two hexamers linked to each other has been interpreted as suggesting that double hexamers are the active helicase machine. T-ag is a complex DNA-binding protein. It binds double- (11Wessel R. Ramsperger U. Stahl H. Knippers R. Virology. 1992; 189: 293-303Google Scholar), as well as single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) (12Wu C. Edgil D. Simmons D.T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10256-10259Google Scholar, 13Wu C. Roy R. Simmons D.T. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2839-2847Google Scholar). Moreover, the duplex DNA binding can be specific to SV40 origin sequences or be sequence-independent (14Simmons D.T. Wun-Kim K. Young W. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4858-4865Google Scholar). The nonspecific binding is crucial for the helicase activity of T-ag. EM analyses of unwinding intermediatesin vivo (15Stahl H. Knippers R. J. Virol. 1983; 47: 65-76Google Scholar) and in vitro (10Wessel R. Schweizer J. Stahl H. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 804-815Google Scholar) have shown that the physiological substrate of T-ag is the border between the melted ssDNA and the intact upstream duplex. In this study we will focus exclusively upon T-ag complexes bound to synthetic replication forks that mimic the structure of the in vivo substrate. The forks we constructed contain a duplex part and 3′ and 5′ ssDNA tails. In principle, T-ag could bind to any combination of these three regions. Moreover, the strength and distribution of these contacts are expected to change during ATP hydrolysis to bring about unwinding. Knowing how T-ag engages its substrate is essential for understanding the molecular mechanism of its helicase activity. Two previous footprinting studies have reached somewhat different conclusions as to how T-ag binds to forks. Wessel et al. (10Wessel R. Schweizer J. Stahl H. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 804-815Google Scholar) have presented evidence that T-ag protects both the duplex and the two ssDNA tails, and SenGupta and Borowiec (16SenGupta D.J. Borowiec J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1656-1661Google Scholar) have proposed that T-ag engages the forks through interactions with only the 3′ ssDNA tail. Binding of T-ag to either synthetic forks or replication bubbles results in the formation of two distinct complexes, which differ in gel mobility and sedimentation velocity (17Smelkova N.V. Borowiec J.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8766-8773Google Scholar). We designate the faster migrating complex on gels as type I and the slower as type II. Smelkova and Borowiec (17Smelkova N.V. Borowiec J.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8766-8773Google Scholar) have found that type II complexes are 15 times more active helicases than type I complexes. Based on parallels with the origin binding activity of T-ag and the structures formed at the SV40 replication origin (18Virshup D.M. Russo A.A. Kelly T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4883-4895Google Scholar), the authors proposed that type I complexes are single hexamers, whereas type II complexes are dimers of type I complexes held together by protein-protein interactions. However, the evidence supporting this model for type II complexes is not strong, and little is known about what governs the formation of the two types of T-ag complexes. Recently Smelkova and Borowiec (19Smelkova N.V. Borowiec J.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8676-8681Google Scholar) found that efficient assembly of type II complexes on replication bubbles requires a ssDNA region of at least 40 nucleotides (nt). To construct a model for how T-ag interacts with the replication forks during unwinding, we systematically characterized the binding of T-ag to ssDNA and to synthetic DNA forks, in the presence or absence of nucleotide cofactors. AMP-PNP (a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog) and ADP were used to mimic the pre-hydrolysis and post-hydrolysis states, respectively, of T-ag helicase. We varied independently the length of the three components of the forks, the duplex region and the 3′ and 5′ ssDNA tails, and found that extension of either the 3′ ssDNA tail or the duplex markedly stimulated the formation of type II complexes. We further demonstrated that T-ag forms a double hexamer in type II complexes but that both type I and type II complexes contain only a single DNA fork. This result required a revision of the model for how double hexamers are arranged at a fork. We found that type I complexes are extremely stable, independent of the bound nucleotide cofactor. In contrast, type II complexes are bound tightly to their substrate in the presence of AMP-PNP but loosen their grip on the DNA when ADP is bound by the helicase. These differences in DNA binding affinities can explain why type II complexes have much higher helicase activity than do type I complexes. SV40 T-ag was immunoaffinity-purified from Sf9 cells as described (20Simanis V. Lane D.P. Virology. 1985; 144: 88-100Google Scholar) using the monoclonal antibody PAb419 with the following modifications. T-ag was eluted either with 50% ethylene glycol, 20 mmTris, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol (pH 8.5) or with 56.5 μl of triethanolamine in 20 ml of 10% glycerol (pH ∼10.8). Eluted T-ag was dialyzed overnight against 10 mmPipes, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pH 7.0) and stored at −80 °C. Oligonucleotides were from Operon and purified by PAGE. All DNA forks contained a duplex part and two poly(dT) tails. DNA forks with duplex lengths of 25, 55, or 80 bp were used. The sequences of the 5′→ 3′ strand of the duplex are as follows: 1) 25 bp, CCC GGT CGT CCA GGT AGT CAC AGA A; 2) 55 bp, CCC GGT CGT CCA GGT AGT CAC AGA AAT GAA GAT CCA TTC GTT TGT GAA TAT CAA G; and 3) 80 bp, CCC GGT CGT CCA GGT AGT CAC AGA AAT GAA GAT CGA ATT CTT TGT GAA TAT CAA GAC TCA TCA TCA CTA GAT GGC ACC TT. The sequences of the ssDNA oligonucleotides used are as follows: 7-mer, TTT TTT T; 13-mer, TCG AAG CTA CGA A; 17-mer, CGA GCT CGG TAC CCG GG; 24-mer, CCC GGT CGT CCA GGT AGT CAC AGA; 32-mer, (T)8 CCC GGT CGT CCA GGT AGT CAC AGA; 44-mer, (T)20 CCC GGT CGT CCA GGT AGT CAC AGA; and 54-mer, (T)30 CCC GGT CGT CCA GGT AGT CAC AGA. Oligonucleotides were 5′-32P-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 10.17-10.19Google Scholar) to a specific activity of ∼1·108 cpm/μg. Polynucleotide kinase was heat-inactivated by a 20-min incubation at 65 °C, and unincorporated32P was removed by passage through a Biospin-6 column (Bio-Rad). Synthetic replication forks and origin duplex were prepared by annealing two partially complementary oligonucleotides in 50-μl reaction mixtures containing 5 pmol of labeled oligo and 5 pmol of cold oligo, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 10 mmMgCl2. Reaction mixtures were heated to 96 °C and cooled overnight. The origin duplex, formed by annealing two complementary oligonucleotides of 83 and 84 nt, contained a single nucleotide (A) 5′ overhang. Klenow fragment was used to fill-in the end of the duplex with a single Biotin-16-dUTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Four pmol of origin duplex with a 5′ overhang were incubated with 5 units of Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs) at 30 °C for 1 h in a 30-μl reaction containing 1× DNA polymerase buffer (New England Biolabs) and 100 μm biotin-16-dUTP. Unless otherwise stated, T-ag·fork complexes were assembled in standard reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing 50 mm triethanolamine (pH 7.6), 7 mm MgCl2, nucleotide cofactor AMP-PNP, ADP, or ATP at final concentrations indicated in the figure legends, 15 fmol (1.5 nm) of labeled fork, 15 fmol (1.5 nm) of labeled SV40 origin-containing fragment, or 100 fmol (10 nm) of ssDNA oligo and the appropriate amount of T-ag. T-ag was diluted in 10 mm Pipes (pH 7.6), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol and added last to the reaction mixture in 5-μl aliquots. When needed, the standard binding reaction was scaled up. The final reaction volume for each experiment is indicated in the figure legends. Binding of T-ag to ssDNA in the absence of nucleotides was carried out in 1 mm MgCl2. Binding reactions were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Glutaraldehyde (final concentration 0.04%) was used to cross-link the protein and to stabilize the T-ag·fork complexes before electrophoresis. Cross-linking was quenched by the addition of 10× quenching buffer (100 mm glycine, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.6)). AMP-PNP is a competitive inhibitor of the helicase activity of T-ag (data not shown). Indicated amounts of T-ag were incubated with radiolabeled DNA forks under standard reaction conditions in the presence of 4 mm ATP. The helicase activity of T-ag leads to melting of the duplex part of the fork and formation of free radiolabeled ssDNA. The helicase reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS and EDTA to final concentrations of 0.5% and 15 mm, respectively. Reactions were further treated with proteinase K (final concentration of 1 mg/ml) for 10 min at 37 °C and then analyzed by electrophoresis through an 8% native polyacrylamide gel. Alternatively, helicase reactions were stopped by glutaraldehyde cross-linking and analyzed by native PAGE (3.5% gel). Binding of T-ag to the synthetic forks or origin-containing duplex was analyzed by gel-shift analysis using non-denaturing PAGE (4 or 3.5% gels, 0.5× TBE, 6–8 V/cm). After electrophoresis, the gels were dried on Whatman paper and autoradiographed or scanned using a Fuji PhosphorImager. Binding was quantified using the Image Gauge version 3.3 software. Filter binding assays were performed using a 96-well slot-blot apparatus (Schleicher & Schuell) as described (22Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12478-12487Google Scholar). Streptavidin-coated ferromagnetic particles were purchased from Dynal. Before use, the beads were washed 1 time with TE and 3 times with 1 m NaCl and then resuspended in 1 mNaCl at a concentration of 10 mg/ml. Five μl of the stock were used for every 30 fmol of biotinylated fork. Beads were added to the reaction mixtures after the assembly of T-ag-DNA complexes was completed and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with occasional mixing. DNA or protein-DNA complexes bound to the beads were isolated from the reaction mixture on magnetic separator stands, washed, and processed as described in the individual experiments. Cross-linked T-ag-DNA complexes were pulled down on streptavidin-coated beads, washed in 50 μl of TE, and allowed to stand for 3 min at room temperature. The TE wash was repeated 2 more times, and the beads were incubated with 20 μl of 1× SDS loading buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 1% SDS, 0.1m dithiothreitol, 0.005% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol) for 5 min at 50 °C and 15 min at room temperature. The beads were pulled down, and the supernatant, containing the cross-linked T-ag oligomers, was recovered and used for SDS-PAGE. Cross-linked T-ag was separated on SDS/PO4 gels according to the procedure of Weber et al. (23Weber K. Pringle J.R. Osborn M. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 26: 3-27Google Scholar). Gels consisted of 0.5% agarose, 3% acrylamide with a ratio of acrylamide/bisacrylamide of 80:1. Gels were run at 0.8 V/cm for 24 h with constant circulation of the buffer and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride or nitrocellulose membranes using the semi-dry transfer system (Bio-Rad). Transfer was carried out in Towbin buffer (without methanol) and lasted for 1.5 h. Membranes were processed for Western analysis using a mouse anti-SV40 antibody (PAb101) (BD Biosciences) and secondary horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (Pierce). The protein was detected using the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce). The quantification of the signals was done using a ChemiImager 5500 by Alpha Innotech Corp. Cross-linked T-ag-DNA complexes were pulled down on streptavidin-coated beads, washed once with 20 μl of 1m NaCl and twice more with 100 μl of TE, and resuspended in 20 μl of TE. The bead suspension, the supernatants after the initial pull-down (S), and the NaCl wash (W) were treated with proteinase K (final concentration of 1 mg/ml) and SDS (0.5%) at 37 °C for 15 min with occasional mixing to prevent sedimentation of the beads. The bead suspension was further treated with NaOH (final concentration of 0.4 n) and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The beads were pulled down, and the supernatant (E) containing radiolabeled DNA was recovered. Salts and sodium hydroxide were removed from samples (S), (W), and (E) by passage through Biospin-6 columns. The flow-through were collected and analyzed by PAGE. Gel shifts from the pull-down experiment were analyzed by PhosphorImager analysis, and the relative percentages of the individual complexes in the binding reactions were determined for each experiment. The percentages were used to calculate the corrected theoretical ratio (corer. Ratio), according to Equation 1,corr.ratio=[¾·(%type II)+½·(%type I)+%bio­fork]/[½·(%type II)](Eq. 1) The calculation assumes that half of type I complexes are formed on biotinylated forks. One 2-μl aliquot containing radioactive nucleotides was spotted onto cellulose polyethyleneimine-thin layer chromatography plates (J. T. Baker Inc.), separated with 1 m formic acid, 0.5 mLiCl, air-dried, and quantified using a Fuji PhosphorImager. The total percentage of all T-ag-ssDNA complexes for each protein concentration was plotted against the free concentration of monomeric T-ag. Free T-ag was determined by subtracting the concentration of the bound T-ag from the total protein concentration, assuming that all complexes represent bound hexamers. Binding data were fit to sigmoidal binding curves by nonlinear least square analysis using Prism 3 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego). The Hill coefficient (n app) and the concentration at the mid-point of the titration curves (S0.5) were determined. For each experiment the relative percentages of type I, type II, type III, and aggregates in each lane were determined from the PhosphorImager analysis of the gel shifts as described above. The data were plotted as percent of complexes (type I or combined type II + type III)versus the total protein concentration expressed as monomers. Under most conditions, type III complexes and aggregates represent a minor fraction of all assembled complexes, except at very high protein concentration. Data sets for each fork were fitted to a sigmoidal binding curve as described for the ssDNA analysis. The Hill coefficient (n app) and the concentration at the mid-point of the titration curves (S0.5) were determined. The best-fit values for S0.5 andn app are presented in the legend to Fig. 2 and refer to the individual data sets. Standard errors for all best-fit values were less than 5% for n app and 2% for S0.5. The 95% confidence intervals of all best-fit curves were narrow, and R2 values were greater than 0.99. The statistical significance of the differences between the curves was evaluated by a pairwise F test. We find that the differences between the curves shown are highly statistically significant, withp values less than 5 × 10−5. Three of the presented seven different binding curves in the presence of ADP (Fig.2 B forks with a 25- and 55-bp duplex, and Fig. 2 Cforks with a 10- and 30-nt 3′ tail) and two of the curves in AMP-PNP (data not shown) were determined twice. We find that the difference between the duplicates is not statistically significant as pvalues using an F-test were greater than 0.03. As binding of T-ag to synthetic forks is expected to occur, at least in part, through interactions with the ssDNA tails, we began our study by investigating the length dependence of T-ag binding to ssDNA using gel-shift analyses (Fig.1 A). One predominant complex was formed independent of the length of the ssDNA. This complex was previously identified as a hexamer (12Wu C. Edgil D. Simmons D.T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10256-10259Google Scholar, 13Wu C. Roy R. Simmons D.T. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2839-2847Google Scholar). Two minor complexes with slower electrophoretic mobility probably representing higher oligomeric states of T-ag were also detected. We found that the affinity of T-ag binding increased with oligonucleotide length, saturating at 45–55 nt (Fig. 1 B). The T-ag preference for long ssDNA is manifest in the presence of either AMP-PNP or ADP. In a competition binding experiment, T-ag bound predominantly to a 54-mer, even in the presence of a more than 1000-fold molar excess of a 24-mer (Fig. 1 C). We next compared quantitatively the binding curves for four ssDNA oligonucleotides with lengths of 24, 32, 44, and 54 nt with increasing amounts of T-ag (Fig. 1 D). The binding data were fit to Hill equations, and the Hill coefficient (n app) and S0.5 values, the protein concentration at the mid-point of the titration curve, were determined (TableI). The values ofn app we obtained are all much greater than 1 (2.4–4.8), which clearly shows cooperative binding to all the oligonucleotides. The molecular basis for the preference of T-ag for binding to long ssDNA seems to be the increase in cooperativity with increasing oligonucleotide length. Additionally, the Hill coefficient (n app) generally gives a lower bound to the number of protomers that are recruited into cooperative binding. Thus,n app can be interpreted as the minimum number of T-ag protomers within the hexamer that are bound to ssDNA. We could therefore derive an approximate value for the maximal length of the ssDNA-binding site of a single T-ag protomer by dividing the length of the ssDNA oligo by n app. The result for all four oligonucleotides is that each T-ag protomer binds ∼9–10 nt (TableI). We also found an interesting dependence of T-ag binding on the absolute concentration of ssDNA oligonucleotide (Fig. 1 E and Table II). The cooperativity of binding to a 54-nt DNA decreased as its concentration was increased. This result can be explained if multiple sites on the T-ag hexamer simultaneously bind to the ssDNA. At low concentrations of ssDNA, successive protomers will be recruited to the same ssDNA (Fig.1 F, dashed line). However, as the concentration of ssDNA in solution is increased, separate ssDNA molecules (solid line) would be bound, resulting in a loss of the free energy associated with the binding of adjacent sites on a single DNA molecule.Table ILength dependence of the binding of T-ag to ssDNALength24-mer32-mer44-mer54-merS 0.5(nM)707349190227n app2.43.84.44.7Length/n app108.51011.5Values for S 0.5, the protein concentration at the mid-point of the titration curve and n app, the Hill coefficient, are derived from averages of two independent experiments by fitting the data to the Hill equation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Binding reactions were performed with 4 mM ADP and 10 nM ssDNA.

We examined whether the nucleotide cofactors affect the binding of T-ag to ssDNA (Fig. 1 G). Although T-ag binds cooperatively to a 54-mer under all three conditions, the presence of nucleotide cofactors clearly makes binding stronger and more cooperative. Thus, we conclude that T-ag binds cooperatively, in a length-dependent fashion to ssDNA, in a reaction stimulated by nucleotide cofactors. We next turned our attention to the analysis of how T-ag binds to synthetic forks, as a model for the in vivosubstrate. As in the ssDNA binding experiments, we investigated first the effect of the length of the DNA forks and, second, the effect of nucleotide cofactors on the binding affinity of T-ag. We focused on data for the formation of type II complexes, as they are the active helicase species. Binding data for type I complexes are shown where they emphasize important distinctions from type II complexes. To determine the effect of the fork length, we independently varied the length of the 3′ ssDNA tail, the 5′ ssDNA tail, or the duplex region starting with a fork consisting of a 25-bp duplex, a 30-nt 5′ ssDNA tail, and a 10-nt 3′ ssDNA tail. We measured T-ag binding by gel shifts in protein titration assays. A representative experiment with this fork is shown in Fig.2 A. As the amount of T-ag was increased, type I complexes were formed first, but at higher protein concentrations type II complexes were the predominant species. A third minor complex, called type III, also formed at high protein concentration, as did aggregates. Type III complexes form when all of the free DNA fork is already bound and probably reflect binding of T-ag to type II complexes. For this reason we add the usually small amount of type III complexes to the type II complexes in quantifying the results (see “Experimental Procedures”). We first examined the effect of the duplex length on T-ag binding. The percentage of type II complexes formed at each protein concentration was plotted along with the binding curves for two different DNA forks (Fig. 2 B). The length of the two ssDNA tails was unchanged, whereas the duplex was extended from 25 to 55 or 80 bp. Extending the duplex to 55 bp stimulated markedly the formation of type II complexes, whereas a further increase in length to 80 bp had no additional effect. Formation of type II complexes on all three forks is clearly cooperative, and the slope of the binding curves increases as the length of the duplex is extended from 25 to 55 bp, indicating increasing cooperativity of T-ag binding. We then analyzed the effect of extending the 3′ ssDNA tail. We compared forks with a 3′ tail of 10, 30, or 60 nt, a 5′ tail of 30 nt, and a duplex of 25 bp (Fig. 2 C). Extending the 3′ ssDNA tail stimulated the formation of type II complexes by increasing the cooperativity of T-ag binding, similar to what we observed when we increased the duplex length. However, with forks containing a 55-bp duplex, the assembly of type II complexes was only modestly enhanced by extending the 3′ ssDNA tail from 10 to 60 nt (Fig. 2 D). Together these results imply that in type II complexes, T-ag interacts extensively with both the duplex part of the fork and the 3′ ssDNA tail. The finding that the assembly of type II complexes is sensitive to the length of the DNA forks prompted us to investigated whether the formation of type I complexes is also DNA length-dependent. The combined binding data for the formation of type I complexes on seven forks (Fig. 2, B–D) of different lengths in the low protein concentration range (in which the percentage of type II complexes was less than 15%) are plotted in Fig. 2 F. The data can all be fit well to a single sigmoidal binding curve (R2 = 0.97), implying that type I complex formation is insensitive to an increase in the length of the fork beyond that of the shortest fork used (25 bp in the duplex, 10 nt in the 3′ ssDNA tail, and 30 nt in the 5′ ssDNA tail), even though formation of type I complexes is also cooperative (Hill coefficient of 3.3). The second aspect of our studies of T-ag binding to synthetic forks was the analysis of the effect of different nucleotide cofactors. As we observed with ssDNA, we found that the binding affinity of T-ag was similar in the presence of ADP or AMP-PNP. Comparative binding curves for type II complexes formed in the presence of either ADP or AMP-PNP on the highest affinity fork (55-bp duplex, 60-nt 3′ tail, and 30-nt 5′ tail) are presented in Fig. 2 E. Moreover, we found that extending the length of the duplex and t"

Consequently, PDK-1 is a pivotal effector enzyme of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, which transduces prosurvival and mitogenic signals in mammalian cells (12Stein R.C. Waterfield M.D. Mol. Med. Today. 2000; 6: 347-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PKC ζ also transduces growth and survival signals.

Caspase processing may activate PKC ζ by separating the catalytic domain from the autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate motif, and the free catalytic domain may or may not depend on transphosphorylation for activity. For example, PKC δ is highly active without transphosphorylation (24Stempka L. Girod A. Muller H.J. Rincke G. Marks F. Gschwendt M. Bossemeyer D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6805-6811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). An acidic residue (Glu500 of PKC δ) that immediately precedes the PDK-1 substrate motif is critical for the inherent catalytic activity of bacterial expressed nontransphosphorylated PKC δ and partially fulfills the role of activation loop phosphorylation of other PKC isoforms (25Stempka L.

The only other PKC isoforms with an acidic residue immediately preceding the PDK-1 substrate motif are PKC ι/λ, ζ, and θ, all of which have an aspartyl residue. In contrast to other isoforms, PKC ζ has a glutamate at the conserved hydrophobic autophosphorylation site (Glu579), which might contribute to constitutive kinase activity. Like PKC ζ, the δ, θ, and μ PKC isoforms are efficiently processed by caspases to catalytic domain fragments (26Ghayur T. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V. Ratnofsky S. Quinlan C. Emoto Y. Pandey P. Datta R.

Because they are divorced from the inhibitory regulatory domain, the kinase domain fragments are considered to be constitutively active (1Nishizuka Y.

Transfection efficiencies were optimized with pcDNA3.1LacZ plasmid (Invitrogen) and histochemical staining with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal), a β-galactosidase substrate (35Cepko C. Ryder E.F. Austin C.P. Walsh C. Fekete D.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 387-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Amino acid substitution mutants were produced by the QuikChange method as described by the manufacturer (Stratagene). Wild type and the T410A mutant of CAT ζ (amino acids 238–592) flanked by KpnI andEcoRI were produced by PCR with Taq DNA polymerase, TA cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), and subcloned into theKpnI/EcoRI sites of pcDNA4C to produce CAT ζ with amino-terminal His6 and Xpress tags. PDK-1 and the kinase-dead K111N PDK-1 mutant were cloned into pcDNA4HisMax plasmid (Invitrogen) in order to produce PDK-1 and K/N PDK-1 with amino-terminal His6 and Xpress epitope tags to facilitate affinity purification from transfected mammalian cells. PDK-1 and K/N PDK-1 cDNAs were produced by PCR with PfuDNA polymerase using PDK-1 and K/N PDK-1 pcDNA3 plasmids as templates. The cDNAs were simultaneously digested with the restriction enzymes and purified by electrophoresis in a low melt agarose gel. The purified cDNAs were ligated into theKpnI/EcoRI sites of pcDNAHisMax4C. Each of the cDNA constructions was validated by sequencing using dye terminator chemistry and an ABI Prism 377 automated sequencer. CAT ζ (amino acids 240–592) and human CAT δ (amino acids 330–676) cDNAs with flanking 5′ HindIII and 3′NotI restriction sites were produced by PCR usingPfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) using the above described PKC ζ pcDNA3.1GS or pBlueBac/PKC δ (ATCC number 80048) as template, cloned by the zero blunt method (Novagen), and subcloned into the HindIII/NotI sites of the ProTet.E133 6×HN vector (CLONTECH). Production of CAT ζ and CAT δ proteins with an amino-terminal (His-Asn)6 tag was induced by treatment of a liter of the BL21PRO strain of Escherichia coli(A 600 = 0.7) with 100 ng/ml anhydrotetracycline for 24 h at 18 °C. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and frozen in a −80 °C freezer. The bacteria were thawed with 10 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer, which contained 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 0.3 mNaCl, 25 μm acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal, 1 mmPefabloc SC and PSC protector (Pierce), 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm benzamidine. The cells were disrupted by sonication on ice with a Branson Cell Disrupter 350 at number 5 output (four cycles of 10 s with a 20-s rest between cycles, pulse mode at 50% duty cycle), and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at 4 °C at 80,000 × g. CAT ζ and δ proteins were purified at room temperature with TALON metal affinity resin (CLONTECH). The supernatant (5 ml) was incubated for 1.5 h with 0.5 ml of packed resin, which had been equilibrated with lysis buffer. The resin was collected by centrifugation, suspended with 5 ml of wash buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, and 0.3 m NaCl, and incubated for 10 min before transferring the suspension to a 2-ml gravity flow column. The resin was washed again with 5 ml of wash buffer and finally with wash buffer containing 5 mmimidazole. Proteins were eluted with wash buffer containing 0.2m imidazole, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. EDTA, EGTA, and DTT were added to the fractions to final concentrations of 0.1, 0.1, and 1 mm, glycerol was added to 20%, and the fractions were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. Purified proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (10% gel), subjected to Western blot analysis, and immunostained with polyclonal antibodies to the extreme carboxyl-terminal segment of CAT ζ (C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or CAT δ (C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The eluate fraction with the highest concentration of CAT ζ or δ (usually the second fraction) was used directly for treatment with PDK-1 and assaying kinase activity. Enzymatically active forms of these three proteins were affinity-purified following transient expression in mammalian cell lines. Two days after transfection, the cells were rinsed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, detached by scraping, collected by centrifugation, and suspended with lysis buffer, which contained 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 150 mmNaCl, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mmimidazole, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm Pefabloc SC and PSC protector, 25 mm acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin. The cells were homogenized with a 26-gauge needle, and the homogenate was centrifuged for 20 min at 16,000 ×g at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated for 30 min with 0.05 ml of packed nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) that had been equilibrated with ice cold lysis buffer. The resin was washed at 4 °C by centrifugation as follows: once with lysis buffer lacking acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal, Pefabloc SC, and PSC protector; three times with wash buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, containing 20 mm imidazole, and 300 mm NaCl); and three times with wash buffer lacking NaCl. Proteins were eluted with two 0.1-ml volumes of elution buffer that contained 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 250 mmimidazole, and 20% glycerol. EDTA, EGTA, and DTT were added to 1 mm, and the fractions were frozen in liquid N2and stored at −80 °C. Purified proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (10% gel) and subjected to Western blot analysis. Purified wild type and mutant forms of PKC ζ, CAT ζ, and PDK-1 were prepared by this method. Transfected HER 911 cells were the source of PDK-1 and amino-terminal His6 Xpress-tagged CAT ζ and T410A CAT ζ. Transfected HEK 293 cells were the source of carboxyl-terminal V5 His6 tagged wild type and mutant PKC ζ and CAT ζ. Immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged PKC ζ or CAT ζ with a monoclonal antibody to the V5 epitope tag (Invitrogen) and assay of immune complex kinase activity using MBP as phosphoacceptor were done as previously described (22Smith L.

Each assay (30 μl) contained 25 mm Hepes-Tris, pH 7.4, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 μm ATP, and an immune complex or affinity-purified PKC ζ, CAT ζ, and/or PDK-1. For the treatment of affinity-purified CAT ζ or F578A CAT ζ with PDK-1 or K110N PDK-1, the reactions contained 10 μm sn-1,2, dipalmitoyl PtdIns 3,4,5-P3(Calbiochem), and 100 μm each of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phospho-l-serine) (Avanti Polar Lipids) for 1 h at 30 °C (30 μl/assay). Kinase assays were started by adding (7.5 μl/assay) 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and either 5 μg of MBP or 40 μm ε peptide (ERMRPRKRQGSVRRRV) as substrate. After 30 min at 30 °C, the reactions were stopped by pipetting 25 μl onto a 2.1-cm phosphocellulose P81 disc (Whatman) and rinsing the discs with 5% acetic acid. The amount of 32P-labeled peptide bound to the disc was determined by scintillation counting. Immunoprecipitated CAT ζ was incubated at 22 °C for 1 h with 2 μg of human recombinant CS1 (γ isoform, 3 units/mg; Calbiochem) in a buffer (30 μl total) that contained 20 mmHepes-Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mmMnCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, and 0.04 mm EDTA. The reaction was stopped by rinsing the immunoprecipitate three times with kinase buffer containing 1 μm calyculin A. Kinase activity was assayed with MBP as substrate as described above. Affinity-purified CAT ζ (2 μl) was incubated with 0.4 μg of CS1 in the buffer described above with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 1 mm MnCl2. Reactions were stopped by the addition of calyculin A to 1 μm, and kinase activity was assayed with MBP as substrate. A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) was used for Western analysis of immunoprecipitates from HeLa cells transfected with epitope-tagged PKC ζ or CAT ζ. Affinity-purified PDK-1 or K/N PDK-1 were quantified by Western blot analysis with anti-Xpress antibody (Invitrogen). Western analysis was done essentially as previously described (22Smith L. Chen L.

Briefly, proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (10% gel), transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.). The membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), which contained 8 g/liter NaCl, 0.2 g/liter KCl, and 3 g/liter Tris and was adjusted to pH 7.4 with HCl and with 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20 in the case of TTBS. Following the incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated first or second antibody, the membrane was rinsed with TTBS and incubated with a chemiluminescent substrate (36Lee H.W. Smith L. Pettit G.R. Vinitsky A. Smith J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20973-20976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Some membranes were immunostained with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (catalog no. 2291; Cell Signaling Technology) that specifically recognizes the phosphothreonine-FCGT motif. It is generally assumed that the free kinase domain of various PKC isoforms is constitutively active because it lacks the inhibitory regulatory domain that includes a pseudosubstrate motif (2Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar, 3Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). To determine whether or not the free kinase domain of PKC ζ depended on threonine 410 for activity, HeLa cells were transfected with wild type or threonine 410 mutants of PKC ζ. A brief treatment of HeLa cells with TNFα plus CHX, which activates caspase-3, evoked the processing of most full-length PKC ζ to two catalytic domain fragments and increased immune complex kinase activity (Fig.1), as previously reported (22Smith L. Chen L. Reyland M.E. DeVries T.A. Talanian R.V. Omura S. Smith J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40620-40627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The TNFα/CHX treatment induced caspase processing of the T410E mutant similarly to wild type PKC ζ; however, the carboxyl-terminal fragment of the T410E mutant had low but significant kinase activity (Fig. 1). This result suggests that threonine 410 has a marked impact on the kinase function of the free catalytic domain of PKC ζ. Although the TNFα/CHX treatment evoked efficient processing of the T410A PKC ζ mutant, relatively little of the carboxyl-terminal fragments accumulated (Fig. 1). Hence, HeLa cells were transfected with wild type or threonine 410 mutants of CAT ζ. The CAT ζ constructs migrated slightly more slowly than the major fragment produced by caspase processing of full-length PKC ζ, because they have 15 additional amino acids (residues 1–15 of PKC ζ). Fig. 1 shows that the T410A CAT ζ immune complex lacked detectable kinase activity and that the T410E CAT ζ immune complex had low but significant kinase activity. These findings agree with the results with affinity-purified T410 CAT ζ mutants (Fig. 2 A) and suggest that threonine 410 modulates the kinase function of the carboxyl-terminal fragment of PKC ζ. The carboxyl-terminal fragments of the T410A CAT ζ appear to be less stable than the wild type or T410E fragments following their production by the TNFα/CHX treatment. CAT ζ is a relatively short lived protein and, like full-length PKC ζ, is ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome (22Smith L. Chen L. Reyland M.E. DeVries T.A. Talanian R.V. Omura S. Smith J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40620-40627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The half-life of CAT ζ was 1.6 ± 0.4 h (n = 4) (mean ± S.E.), as determined by Western blot analysis following the treatment of the HeLa cells with CHX for 1–4 h. The deficiency in the kinase activity of the T410A and T410E CAT ζ immune complexes from transfected HeLa cells was confirmed following metal affinity purification from transfected HER 911 cells (Fig. 2 A). Wild type CAT ζ was active and positively immunostained with an antibody that specifically recognized the phosphorylated PDK-1 substrate motif (phospho-Thr-Phe-Cys-Gly-Thr) (Fig. 2 A). The T410A CAT ζ mutant lacked detectable kinase activity and was not recognized by the phospho-Thr410 antibody (Fig. 2 A). The mutant with the negatively charged glutamate substituted for Thr410 (T410E CAT ζ) to partially mimic phosphothreonine had significant kinase activity, although it was much less active than wild type CAT ζ (Fig. 2 A). PDK-1 was recently shown to dock to a hydrophobic motif in the carboxyl-terminal tail of PKC ζ (37Balendran A. Biondi R.M. Cheung P.C. Casamayor A. Deak M. Alessi D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20806-20813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Substitution of Ala for Phe578 of this motif essentially abolished Thr410 phosphorylation and the kinase activity of immune complexes from 293 cells transfected with amino-terminal epitope-tagged full-length PKC ζ (37Balendran A. Biondi R.M. Cheung P.C. Casamayor A. Deak M. Alessi D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20806-20813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We have confirmed this result and extended it to the free catalytic domain. In contrast to wild type CAT ζ, F578A CAT ζ had no detectable kinase activity and was not immunostained by the phospho-Thr410 antibody following affinity purification from transfected HEK 293 cells (Fig. 2 B). The F578A mutant of full-length PKC ζ was weakly immunostained by the phospho-Thr410 antibody and exhibited weak but significant kinase activity (Fig. 2 B). The regulatory domain apparently influences Thr410 phosphorylation in 293 cells, because F578A CAT ζ lacked detectable phospho-Thr410, whereas F578A PKC ζ was partially active and phosphorylated at Thr410. To address the possibility that the carboxyl-terminal V5 and His6 tags or the inclusion of the first 15 amino acids of PKC ζ was responsible for the requirement for phospho-Thr410 for kinase activity, amino-terminal His6 Xpress-tag"

Initial studies found that endogenous hECE-1 was constitutively phosphorylated in a primary endothelial cell line. The four known isoforms of hECE-1 expressed in this cell line (1a, 1b, 1c, and 1d) were then cloned by reverse transcription-PCR to determine which isoform(s) may be phosphorylated. The isoforms differ only in the first portion of their short amino-terminal cytoplasmic domains whereas their transmembrane domains and ectodomains of the proteins are identical. Isoforms 1b, 1c, and 1d but not 1a, were constitutively phosphorylated in vivo when expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and casein kinase I readily phosphorylated the immunopurified isoforms in vitro. Site-directed mutagenesis established that two conserved serine residues, Ser18 and Ser20, (numbering based on isoform 1c) form at least one phosphorylation site in these three isoforms. Mutant forms of 1b, 1c, and 1d were constructed in which a single alanine was introduced at either serine residue and a double mutant for each isoform was constructed as well in which both serines were replaced with alanine. Phosphorylation of the single mutants was greatly reduced and was nearly abolished in the double mutants in both in vivo andin vitro labeling assays. Analysis by MALDI-MS of32P-labeled proteolytic peptides derived from wild type 1c and the 1c mutants supported both Ser18 and Ser20 as phosphorylated residues. These data demonstrate the first finding that hECE-1 is constitutively phosphorylated within its cytoplasmic domain in an isoform-specific manner.

Cell. 1994; 78: 473-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar), potent vasoconstrictive and mitogenic substances produced mainly by endothelial and smooth muscle cells. ECE may be involved in the synthesis and/or degradation of other peptide hormones as well (2Hoang M.V. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 3Johnson G.D. Stevenson T. Ahn K. J. Biol.

Ohkubo C. Kimura T. Kosaka A. Inoue N. Ishida Y. Mitsui H. Onda M. Fujino M. Masaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2863-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar). ETs are produced as large preproendothelin polypeptides, containing ∼200 amino acids. Following removal of the signal peptides, the inactive intermediate big ET is formed consisting of 38–41 amino acids. ECE then cleaves big ET between Trp21 and Val22/Ile22 to generate the mature active 21-amino acid protein (1Xu D. Emoto N. Giaid A. Slaughter C. Kaw S. deWit D. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1994; 78: 473-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 5Shimada K. Takahashi M. Tanzawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18275-18278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of this cleavage site is demonstrated by the fact that the vasoconstricting activity of either ET-1-(1–20) amino acids or ET-1-(1–22) amino acids is three orders of magnitude weaker than ET-1-(1–21) amino acids (6Nishikori M. Tsuchida S. Okada M. Fukuroda T. Shimamoto K. Yano M. Ishikawa K. Ikemoto F. Neurochem. Int. 1991; 18: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The enzyme therefore plays a key role in maintaining vascular tone by catalyzing the production of ET, making it an important target for the treatment of pathological conditions such as cardiovascular and renal diseases.ECE belongs to the M13 subfamily of neutral endopeptidases. The mammalian subfamily consists of eight other members, including neprilysin (NEP) (7Malfroy B. Kuang W.J. Seeburg P.H. Mason A.J. Schofield P.R.

These enzymes are type-II integral membrane proteins with a short amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain followed by a single transmembrane domain and a large carboxyl-terminal domain containing the active site.

In addition, isoforms 1b, 1c, and 1d contain isoform-specific phosphorylation sequences in their unique amino termini for CK-I, CK-II, cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), and protein kinase C (PKC). Given that phosphorylation plays a critical role for the proper function and/or localization of numerous proteins, we wished to investigate whether any or all of the hECE-1 isoforms are phosphorylated. In order to assess phosphorylation of hECE-1, we performed in vivo metabolic labeling with [32P]orthophosphate in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We then cloned the isoforms 1b, 1c, and 1d by RT-PCR using total RNA isolated from HUVECs. Each isoform was expressed in CHO cells for in vivo phosphorylation studies, and the immunopurified proteins were used for in vitro kinase assays. Site-directed mutations of the phosphoamino acids were constructed to analyze phosphorylation of ECE-1.DISCUSSIONThe results described in this study demonstrate the first finding that hECE-1 is phosphorylated. Isoforms 1c, 1d, and 1b, and to a lesser degree 1a, appear to be constitutively phosphorylated in vivo. Phosphate incorporation was not increased by PKC or PKA stimulation. Based upon in vitro analysis, the kinase involved may be CK-I or a CK-I-like kinase. We determined a major phosphorylation site at Ser18 and Ser20 in isoforms 1c as well as the corresponding serine residues in isoforms 1b and 1d using site-directed mutagenesis. These data were also supported by MALDI-MS analysis on isoform 1c. The two serine residues are conserved in the cytosolic tails of isoforms 1c, 1b, and 1d, but not in isoform 1a, the most divergent isoform. Weak 32P labeling of 1a however, suggests that other phosphorylation sites may exist for the isoforms. Because the protein samples analyzed by MALDI-MS were recovered from small scale in vivo labeling experiments, the mass spectral data contained relatively weak signals from the HPLC fractions of the proteolytic digests. The lower intensity of these phosphopeptides (and their dephosphorylation products) in the presence of other peptides coeluting in the labeled HPLC fractions further exacerbated this problem and precluded more definitive localization studies using techniques such as post-source decay analysis.ET-1 secretion is dependent upon numerous factors including hypoxia, epinephrine, angiotensin II, oncostatin, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, interferon-γ, and transforming growth factor-β (for review see Ref. 24Russell F.D. Davenport A.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 126: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Each of these factors involves complex signaling pathways that often include tyrosine protein kinases or serine/threonine protein kinases. In addition, studies have demonstrated that mRNA levels and protein expression of ECE-1a may be up-regulated in response to PKC (25Orzechowski H.D. Gunther A. Menzel S. Zimmerman A. Funke-Kaiser Real R. Subkowski T. Zollmann F.S. Paul M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1332-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) but no previous studies have demonstrated that ECE-1 protein is directly modified by any kinases.ECE-1 isoforms contain a number of phosphorylation consensus sequences indicating that the enzyme may be phosphorylated. NEP was reported to be phosphorylated by CK II in vitro and appeared to be phosphorylated in vivo on a serine or threonine (26Ganju R.K. Shpektor R.G. Brenner D.G. Shipp M.A. Blood. 1996; 88: 4159-4165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although it was suggested using a soluble form of NEP that the phosphorylated residue(s) reside in the cytoplasmic tail, the phosphorylated amino acid(s) were not identified in the study. There have also been recent reports of other metalloproteases being modified by phosphorylation (27Tullai J.W. Cummins P.M. Pabon A. Roberts J.L. Lopingeo M.C. Shrimpton C.N. Smith A.I.

Our results clearly demonstrate constitutive phosphorylation of ECE-1.The subcellular localization of the four isoforms and their respective sites of activity remain unclear. Differences in localization of the isoforms may affect phosphorylation of the proteins. It is possible that phosphorylation may regulate activity, either directly or indirectly, in different parts of the cell affecting substrate specificity, as the pH optimum for ECE-1 activity is substrate-dependent. Small peptide hormones such as bradykinin and substance P have an acidic pH optima of 5.6–5.8, whereas big ET-1 has a neutral pH optimum, indicating that different substrates may be cleaved in different intracellular compartments (29Fahnoe D.C. Knapp J. Johnson G.D. Ahn K. J. Cardiovasc. Phamacol. 2000; 36 Suppl. 1: S22-S25Crossref Google Scholar). Isoforms localized to different subcellular areas may have different functions and phosphorylation of ECE-1 may be one way of regulating activity of the enzyme, directly or indirectly. A better understanding of the pathways involved and the processing of the various substrates is needed.It is also important to note that many functions of ET and ECE depend upon cell types. Differences in mRNA levels of the four ECE-1 isoforms vary between cell types. For example, 1a is highly expressed in HUVECs but undetectable in HSMC (16Valdenaire O. Lepailleur-Enouf D. Egidy G. Thouard A. Barret A. Vranckx R. Tougard C. Michel J.-B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The different isoform-specific promoters are believed to relate to tissue-specific differences or to developmental or pathological differences. Phosphorylation of ECE-1 isoforms may also be dependent upon cell-type or physiological conditions. Results from this study indicate that ECE-1 is constitutively phosphorylated in HUVECs, which contain message of all four isoforms. It will be of interest to determine which isoform(s) this is as well as to determine phosphorylation patterns of ECE-1 endogenously expressed in other tissues and the conditions under which the proteins may be phosphorylated.The results in this study also demonstrate that CK-I can phosphorylate ECE-1 in vitro. The initial consensus phosphorylation sequence for CK-I, S/T(P)X1–2S/T/Y, was determined where S/T(P) is any phosphorylated serine or threonine upstream from the target amino acid (S/T/Y), and X is any amino acid. The phosphorylated S/T provides a favorable negative charge immediately amino-terminal to the target serine or threonine residue. Additional studies have revealed optimal sequences for non-phosphate-directed phosphorylation by CK-I isoforms (30Pulgar V. Marin O. Meggio F. Allende C.C. Allende J.E. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 520-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A cluster of more than three acidic residues upstream from position n-2 was required for optimal phosphorylation efficiency. For instance the tetrapeptide DDDD between n-6 and n-3 from the target serine served as a potent substrate. The phosphorylated serine residues in ECE-1b, 1c, and 1d all contain an extremely acidic region immediately amino-terminal to the phosphorylation sites identified in this study; DEEDLVDSLSE, agreeing with a predicted consensus sequence for CK-I. The sequence DEEDLVDSLSE found in hECE-1 is well conserved between several different mammalian species including bovine, guinea pig, and rat. A similar sequence consisting of serines flanked by acidic residues is found in the chicken ECE isoform (DDEDPLDSISESD). The sequence is not found in mouse, hECE-1a, hECE-2, or hNEP. Because this region appears to be conserved in several mammalian species, phosphorylation of these serines may be a common event.We have demonstrated that hECE-1 is constitutively phosphorylated in HUVECs and that isoforms 1b, 1c, and 1d are phosphorylated bothin vivo and in vitro on two conserved serine residues found in their cytoplasmic tails. We have also provided evidence that CK-I phosphorylates the proteins in vitro. This is the first study showing phosphorylation of ECE-1 and identifies the residues involved. It will be interesting to determine which endogenous isoforms and residues are phosphorylated in other cell lines using isoform-specific antibodies. Further work will be required to define more completely the role of ECE-1 phosphorylation and possibly identify other phosphoresidues in ECE-1.

Emoto N. Giaid A. Slaughter C. Kaw S. deWit D. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1994; 78: 473-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar), potent vasoconstrictive and mitogenic substances produced mainly by endothelial and smooth muscle cells. ECE may be involved in the synthesis and/or degradation of other peptide hormones as well (2Hoang M.V. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 3Johnson G.D. Stevenson T. Ahn K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4053-4058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Three endothelin peptides have been identified (ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3) (4Inoue A.M. Yanagisawa S. Ohkubo C. Kimura T. Kosaka A. Inoue N. Ishida Y. Mitsui H. Onda M. Fujino M. Masaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2863-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar). ETs are produced as large preproendothelin polypeptides, containing ∼200 amino acids. Following removal of the signal peptides, the inactive intermediate big ET is formed consisting of 38–41 amino acids. ECE then cleaves big ET between Trp21 and Val22/Ile22 to generate the mature active 21-amino acid protein (1Xu D. Emoto N. Giaid A. Slaughter C. Kaw S. deWit D. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1994; 78: 473-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 5Shimada K. Takahashi M. Tanzawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18275-18278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of this cleavage site is demonstrated by the fact that the vasoconstricting activity of either ET-1-(1–20) amino acids or ET-1-(1–22) amino acids is three orders of magnitude weaker than ET-1-(1–21) amino acids (6Nishikori M. Tsuchida S. Okada M. Fukuroda T. Shimamoto K. Yano M. Ishikawa K. Ikemoto F. Neurochem. Int. 1991; 18: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The enzyme therefore plays a key role in maintaining vascular tone by catalyzing the production of ET, making it an important target for the treatment of pathological conditions such as cardiovascular and renal diseases. ECE belongs to the M13 subfamily of neutral endopeptidases. The mammalian subfamily consists of eight other members, including neprilysin (NEP) (7Malfroy B. Kuang W.J. Seeburg P.H. Mason A.J. Schofield P.R. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), the erythrocyte cell-surface antigen Kell (KELL) (8Lee S. Zambas E.D. Marsh W.L. Redman C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6353-6357Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and a phosphate-regulating neutral endopeptidase (PEX) (9Consortium T.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 130-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). These enzymes are type-II integral membrane proteins with a short amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain followed by a single transmembrane domain and a large carboxyl-terminal domain containing the active site. Two isoenzymes of ECE have been cloned and characterized, ECE-1 (1Xu D. Emoto N. Giaid A. Slaughter C. Kaw S. deWit D. Yanagisawa M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 15262-15268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The overall amino acid sequence identity of ECE-1 to ECE-2 is 59% and they differ in substrate specificity, pH optimum, cellular localization, and tissue distribution. Four isoforms of human ECE-1 (1a, 1b, 1c, and 1d) have been cloned. The four proteins are encoded by one gene and share a common carboxyl-terminal portion. Each is expressed from one of four distinct promoters that regulate expression of four unique amino termini (13Valdenaire O. Rohrbacher E. Mattei M.G. J. Biol.

Although the ectodomain containing the active site is identical in each of the isoforms, the diverse amino-terminal sequences may be responsible for differences in tissue-specificity of expression as well as differences in subcellular localization.

All four isoforms of hECE-1 contain several consensus recognition sequences for a variety of kinases. In addition, isoforms 1b, 1c, and 1d contain isoform-specific phosphorylation sequences in their unique amino termini for CK-I, CK-II, cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), and protein kinase C (PKC).

Based upon in vitro analysis, the kinase involved may be CK-I or a CK-I-like kinase. We determined a major phosphorylation site at Ser18 and Ser20 in isoforms 1c as well as the corresponding serine residues in isoforms 1b and 1d using site-directed mutagenesis. These data were also supported by MALDI-MS analysis on isoform 1c. The two serine residues are conserved in the cytosolic tails of isoforms 1c, 1b, and 1d, but not in isoform 1a, the most divergent isoform. Weak 32P labeling of 1a however, suggests that other phosphorylation sites may exist for the isoforms. Because the protein samples analyzed by MALDI-MS were recovered from small scale in vivo labeling experiments, the mass spectral data contained relatively weak signals from the HPLC fractions of the proteolytic digests.

Our results clearly demonstrate constitutive phosphorylation of ECE-1.The subcellular localization of the four isoforms and their respective sites of activity remain unclear. Differences in localization of the isoforms may affect phosphorylation of the proteins. It is possible that phosphorylation may regulate activity, either directly or indirectly, in different parts of the cell affecting substrate specificity, as the pH optimum for ECE-1 activity is substrate-dependent. Small peptide hormones such as bradykinin and substance P have an acidic pH optima of 5.6–5.8, whereas big ET-1 has a neutral pH optimum, indicating that different substrates may be cleaved in different intracellular compartments (29Fahnoe D.C. Knapp J. Johnson G.D. Ahn K. J. Cardiovasc. Phamacol. 2000; 36 Suppl. 1: S22-S25Crossref Google Scholar). Isoforms localized to different subcellular areas may have different functions and phosphorylation of ECE-1 may be one way of regulating activity of the enzyme, directly or indirectly. A better understanding of the pathways involved and the processing of the various substrates is needed.It is also important to note that many functions of ET and ECE depend upon cell types. Differences in mRNA levels of the four ECE-1 isoforms vary between cell types. For example, 1a is highly expressed in HUVECs but undetectable in HSMC (16Valdenaire O. Lepailleur-Enouf D. Egidy G.

The initial consensus phosphorylation sequence for CK-I, S/T(P)X1–2S/T/Y, was determined where S/T(P) is any phosphorylated serine or threonine upstream from the target amino acid (S/T/Y), and X is any amino acid. The phosphorylated S/T provides a favorable negative charge immediately amino-terminal to the target serine or threonine residue. Additional studies have revealed optimal sequences for non-phosphate-directed phosphorylation by CK-I isoforms (30Pulgar V. Marin O. Meggio F. Allende C.C. Allende J.E. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 520-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A cluster of more than three acidic residues upstream from position n-2 was required for optimal phosphorylation efficiency. For instance the tetrapeptide DDDD between n-6 and n-3 from the target serine served as a potent substrate. The phosphorylated serine residues in ECE-1b, 1c, and 1d all contain an extremely acidic region immediately amino-terminal to the phosphorylation sites identified in this study; DEEDLVDSLSE, agreeing with a predicted consensus sequence for CK-I. The sequence DEEDLVDSLSE found in hECE-1 is well conserved between several different mammalian species including bovine, guinea pig, and rat. A similar sequence consisting of serines flanked by acidic residues is found in the chicken ECE isoform (DDEDPLDSISESD). The sequence is not found in mouse, hECE-1a, hECE-2, or hNEP. Because this region appears to be conserved in several mammalian species, phosphorylation of these serines may be a common event.We have demonstrated that hECE-1 is constitutively phosphorylated in HUVECs and that isoforms 1b, 1c, and 1d are phosphorylated bothin vivo and in vitro on two conserved serine residues found in their cytoplasmic tails. We have also provided evidence that CK-I phosphorylates the proteins in vitro. This is the first study showing phosphorylation of ECE-1 and identifies the residues involved. It will be interesting to determine which endogenous isoforms and residues are phosphorylated in other cell lines using isoform-specific antibodies.

The subcellular localization of the four isoforms and their respective sites of activity remain unclear. Differences in localization of the isoforms may affect phosphorylation of the proteins. It is possible that phosphorylation may regulate activity, either directly or indirectly, in different parts of the cell affecting substrate specificity, as the pH optimum for ECE-1 activity is substrate-dependent. Small peptide hormones such as bradykinin and substance P have an acidic pH optima of 5.6–5.8, whereas big ET-1 has a neutral pH optimum, indicating that different substrates may be cleaved in different intracellular compartments (29Fahnoe D.C. Knapp J. Johnson G.D. Ahn K. J. Cardiovasc. Phamacol. 2000; 36 Suppl. 1: S22-S25Crossref Google Scholar). Isoforms localized to different subcellular areas may have different functions and phosphorylation of ECE-1 may be one way of regulating activity of the enzyme, directly or indirectly. A better understanding of the pathways involved and the processing of the various substrates is needed. It is also important to note that many functions of ET and ECE depend upon cell types. Differences in mRNA levels of the four ECE-1 isoforms vary between cell types. For example, 1a is highly expressed in HUVECs but undetectable in HSMC (16Valdenaire O. Lepailleur-Enouf D. Egidy G. Thouard A. Barret A. Vranckx R. Tougard C. Michel J.-B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The different isoform-specific promoters are believed to relate to tissue-specific differences or to developmental or pathological differences. Phosphorylation of ECE-1 isoforms may also be dependent upon cell-type or physiological conditions. Results from this study indicate that ECE-1 is constitutively phosphorylated in HUVECs, which contain message of all four isoforms. It will be of interest to determine which isoform(s) this is as well as to determine phosphorylation patterns of ECE-1 endogenously expressed in other tissues and the conditions under which the proteins may be phosphorylated. The results in this study also demonstrate that CK-I can phosphorylate ECE-1 in vitro. The initial consensus phosphorylation sequence for CK-I, S/T(P)X1–2S/T/Y, was determined where S/T(P) is any phosphorylated serine or threonine upstream from the target amino acid (S/T/Y), and X is any amino acid. The phosphorylated S/T provides a favorable negative charge immediately amino-terminal to the target serine or threonine residue. Additional studies have revealed optimal sequences for non-phosphate-directed phosphorylation by CK-I isoforms (30Pulgar V. Marin O. Meggio F. Allende C.C. Allende J.E. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 520-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A cluster of more than three acidic residues upstream from position n-2 was required for optimal phosphorylation efficiency. For instance the tetrapeptide DDDD between n-6 and n-3 from the target serine served as a potent substrate. The phosphorylated serine residues in ECE-1b, 1c, and 1d all contain an extremely acidic region immediately amino-terminal to the phosphorylation sites identified in this study; DEEDLVDSLSE, agreeing with a predicted consensus sequence for CK-I. The sequence DEEDLVDSLSE found in hECE-1 is well conserved between several different mammalian species including bovine, guinea pig, and rat. A similar sequence consisting of serines flanked by acidic residues is found in the chicken ECE isoform (DDEDPLDSISESD). The sequence is not found in mouse, hECE-1a, hECE-2, or hNEP. Because this region appears to be conserved in several mammalian species, phosphorylation of these serines may be a common event. We have demonstrated that hECE-1 is constitutively phosphorylated in HUVECs and that isoforms 1b, 1c, and 1d are phosphorylated bothin vivo and in vitro on two conserved serine residues found in their cytoplasmic tails. We have also provided evidence that CK-I phosphorylates the proteins in vitro. This is the first study showing phosphorylation of ECE-1 and identifies the residues involved. It will be interesting to determine which endogenous isoforms and residues are phosphorylated in other cell lines using isoform-specific antibodies. Further work will be required to define more completely the role of ECE-1 phosphorylation and possibly identify other phosphoresidues in ECE-1. We thank Dr. Bernd-M Loffler (F.
