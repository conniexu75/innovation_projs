https://openalex.org/W1976560500,"Despite variations in pore diameter and pore concentration between 22 species of planktonic Foraminifera, shell porosites are relatively uniform for those co-occurring in the same latitudinal belts: over 10 percent for tropicalsubtropical species; 5 to 10 percent for temperate species; and less than 5 percent for subpolar-polar species. Shell porosities of fossil planktonic Foraminifera may be useful indices for interpreting Cenozoic climates."
https://openalex.org/W2004514946,"X-ray diffraction studies made in situ under conditions of high pressure and high temperature revealed the direct transition of rutile to the alpha lead dioxide form in titanium dioxide. Compressibility studies of this alpha lead dioxide form at room temperature showed anomalous behavior in that its molar volume converges close to, but not equal to, that of the rutile form. Under this circumstance an unexpectedly large error appears in the calculations of the equilibrium pressure for the two forms at 298 degrees K."
https://openalex.org/W1989124294,Plant fossils from Lower Permian strata of the southwestern United States have been interpreted as cycadalean megasporophylls. They are evidently descended from spermopterid elements of the Pennsylvanian Taeniopteris complex; thus the known fossil history of the cycads is extended from the Late Triassic into the late Paleozoic. Possible implications of the Permian fossils toward evolution of the angiosperm carpel are considered.
https://openalex.org/W2052616509,"The average tilt of Mars' equator with respect to its orbital plane may have increased significantly over the age of the solar system. Obliquity oscillations might have induced changes in the climate, which altered the mass distribution and hence the solar torque on the planet. Viscous deformation attributable to loading by the large polar caps expected at low obliquity may have induced secular changes in the axial tilt. Earth-like effective viscosities can account for virtually the entire present obliquity of 24.4 degrees. Thus the present average tilt of Mars may not be primordial."

The article discusses the significance of transforms in numerical work, defines the modern forms of several common transforms and their inverses, gives examples, and describes and gives references to methods of numerical evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W1991257051,"Glassy objects of spherical, oval, dumbbell, teardrop, and irregular shapes have been found in a deep-sea sediment core taken off the Ivory Coast. They occur in a layer of sediment that was apparently deposited about 800,000 years ago. Their geographic location, appearance, and physical properties suggest that they are microtektites and that they are related to the tektite-strewn field of the Ivory Coast."

https://openalex.org/W2057193596,"A few leafy gymnosperm shoots were found in Eocene deposits of southeastern North America. Similar fossil material from Tertiary deposits in North America has been identified as Taxodium, Taxites, and Sequoia. This new fossil material is not related to these genera but belongs to Podocarpus section Stachycarpus. This is the first fossil record of this section in North America."
https://openalex.org/W2079167403,The hydrolysis of methyl phosphate bound to the triethylenetetramine-cobalt(III) ion is much faster than the hydrolysis of either dimethyl phosphate bound to the same cation or methyl phosphate bound to the pentamminecobalt-(III) ion. The rate enhancement is attributed to bidenate coordination of the methyl phosphate. This feature suggests a pseudorotation mechanism analogous to that proposed by Westheimer for the hydrolysis of ethylene methyl phosphate. Stabilization of bidentate coordination might play a role in metal ion activation of phosphate-transfer enzymes.
https://openalex.org/W2038733396,"The solar constant was directly measured from an altitude of about 82 kilometers-apparently the first such determination. The total solar intensity was 136.1 milliwatts per square centimeter, or 1.952 calories per square centimeter, per minute-about 2.5 percent less than Johnson's derived value. Energy in the ultraviolet and visible regions (for lambda less than 607 nanometers) was 7.0 percent less than that obtained by integration over Johnson'Scurve; for integral flux of lambda greater than 607 nanometers there was almost perfect agreement. Seven supporting series of measurements from lower altitudes agreed extremely well with these results after correction for atmospheric extinction."

https://openalex.org/W2059201843,"A basalt pavement outcrops almost continuously in a band along the crestal region of the East Pacific Rise from about 14 degrees S to 6 degrees S, that is, for more than 800 ikilometers; the outcrop may well extend beyond the above limits along the axis of the rise. The basalt band is generally between 40 and 60 kilometers wide and is replaced laterally by sediment. The lavas are fresh, ""oceanic tholeiites"" which were emplaced less than I million years ago by fissure eruptions. These findings, can be explained by the hypothesis of ocean-floor spreading; the basalts are the expression of material originating from the mantle and rising through fissures along the axis of the ridge. The absence of an axial rift valley on the East Pacific Rise may be explained by the fact that large volumes of lava are being outpoured along its crest."

https://openalex.org/W2077975302,"Vertical profiles of solar radiation in openings in forest canopies showed increasing solar radiation with depth in Colorado, but not in Minnesota. A model was developed and tested to calculate solar radiation in openings from the incoming direct and sky radiation and from the depth and diameter of the opening. The increase occurs only with high direct and low sky radiation. The model may explain the geographic and seasonal distribution of the solar radiation profiles and the lack of such observations previously."

https://openalex.org/W2051185835,"Soap bubbles of long life (over 2 years) and large size (over 60 centimeters in diameter, 100 liters volume) have been produced from bubble solutions improved by the addition of water-soluble synthetic organic polymers such as polyvinyl alcohol or polyoxyethylene. The natural life can be defined as the time it takes for the bubble, if left undisturbed, to contract from the original size to a flat film."

https://openalex.org/W1964768917,"Comparisons of the various crater counts obtained from the Mariner IV photographs indicate that, out of 300 to 600 possible craters mapped by different investigators, only about 120 craters can be reliably identified. Thus, only a lower limit for the Martian crater density can be established from the Mariner IV data."

For other metals the method should have the highest eficiency, if these have low melting points and are liquids over a wide temperature range."

https://openalex.org/W2006613069,"Clay gels were prepared by extrusion of sodium-Wyoming bentonite pastes through a small orifice. Clay sols were prepared from the gels by rapping on the laboratory bench for disturbance. Lettuce seeds germinated faster, microbes generated more heat, and corn seedlings absorbed more 22Na in the sols than in the gels. These differences in biological activity are attributable to changes in water properties and ion activities that accompany transformation from gel to sol."

No precedent is involved in its adoption, for in times of peace oceanographic studies heretofore have always been an important part of the Navy's duties. With these closing words I commend the plan to you as most worthy of your consideration and support."
