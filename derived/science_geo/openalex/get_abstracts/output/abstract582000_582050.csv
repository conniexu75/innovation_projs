Blancon et al. show that if the perovskite layer is more than two unit cells thick, photogenerated excitons undergo an unusual but highly efficient process for creating free carriers that can be harvested in photovoltaic devices (see the Perspective by Bakr and Mohammed). Lower-energy local states at the edges of the perovskite layer facilitate dissociation into electrons and holes that are well protected from recombination.

https://openalex.org/W2595907366,"We describe complete design of a synthetic eukaryotic genome, Sc2.0, a highly modified Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome reduced in size by nearly 8%, with 1.1 megabases of the synthetic genome deleted, inserted, or altered. Sc2.0 chromosome design was implemented with BioStudio, an open-source framework developed for eukaryotic genome design, which coordinates design modifications from nucleotide to genome scales and enforces version control to systematically track edits. To achieve complete Sc2.0 genome synthesis, individual synthetic chromosomes built by Sc2.0 Consortium teams around the world will be consolidated into a single strain by ""endoreduplication intercross."" Chemically synthesized genomes like Sc2.0 are fully customizable and allow experimentalists to ask otherwise intractable questions about chromosome structure, function, and evolution with a bottom-up design strategy."

The response of whole-soil profiles to warming has not been tested in situ. In a deep warming experiment in mineral soil, we found that CO2 production from all soil depths increased with 4°C warming; annual soil respiration increased by 34 to 37%. All depths responded to warming with similar temperature sensitivities, driven by decomposition of decadal-aged carbon. Whole-soil warming reveals a larger soil respiration response than many in situ experiments (most of which only warm the surface soil) and models."

Koyama et al. took inspiration from bone to develop a steel with a laminated substructure that arrests cracks. The resulting hierarchical material has much better fatigue resistance properties than other iron alloys. The strategy need not be limited to steel; other metal alloys should also benefit from this type of microstructural engineering. Science , this issue p. 1055"

Despite this importance, systematic estimates of historical seawater pH are lacking. Halevy and Bachan developed a model of seawater chemistry and pH over time scales exceeding ∼100 million years. Their highly robust probabilistic history of seawater pH and chemistry reflects evolving properties of Earth's atmosphere, oceans, and crust. Seawater pH increased from early Archean values of ∼6.5 to 7.0 to more recent values of ∼7.5 to 9.0 mostly as a result of solar brightening and decreasing interaction between seawater and oceanic crust.

Gallego et al. propose a way to rationalize the process by using structure-directing agents that act as scaffolds for creating the zeolite pores and channels (see the Perspective by Millini). They picked molecules that mimic the transition states for reactions such as the isomerization of ethylbenzene into xylene, and they successfully identified catalysts with improved reactant conversion and product selectivity.

https://openalex.org/W2594133343,"Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are diverse, naturally occurring bacteria that establish a close association with plant roots and promote the growth and immunity of plants. Established mechanisms involved in PGPR-mediated plant growth promotion include regulation of phytohormones, improved nutrient availability, and antagonistic effects on plant pathogens. In this study, we isolated a bacterium from the rhizospheric soil of a soybean field in Chungcheong buk-do, South Korea. Using 16S rRNA sequencing, the bacterium was identified as Bacillus aryabhattai strain SRB02. Here we show that this strain significantly promotes the growth of soybean. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis showed that SRB02 produced significant amounts of abscisic acid, indole acetic acid, cytokinin and different gibberellic acids in culture. SRB02-treated soybean plants showed significantly better heat stress tolerance than did untreated plants. These plants also produced consistent levels of ABA under heat stress and exhibited ABA-mediated stomatal closure. High levels of IAA, JA, GA12, GA4, and GA7, were recorded in SRB02-treated plants. These plants produced longer roots and shoots than those of control plants. B. aryabhattai SRB02 was found to be highly tolerant to oxidative stress induced by H2O2 and MV potentiated by high catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities. SRB02 also tolerated high nitrosative stress induced by the nitric oxide donors GSNO and CysNO. Because of these attributes, B. aryabhattai SRB02 may prove to be a valuable resource for incorporation in biofertilizers and other soil amendments that seek to improve crop productivity."
https://openalex.org/W2592535880,"Music emotion recognition (MER) field rapidly expanded in the last decade. Many new methods and new audio features are developed to improve the performance of MER algorithms. However, it is very difficult to compare the performance of the new methods because of the data representation diversity and scarcity of publicly available data. In this paper, we address these problems by creating a data set and a benchmark for MER. The data set that we release, a MediaEval Database for Emotional Analysis in Music (DEAM), is the largest available data set of dynamic annotations (valence and arousal annotations for 1,802 songs and song excerpts licensed under Creative Commons with 2Hz time resolution). Using DEAM, we organized the 'Emotion in Music' task at MediaEval Multimedia Evaluation Campaign from 2013 to 2015. The benchmark attracted, in total, 21 active teams to participate in the challenge. We analyze the results of the benchmark: the winning algorithms and feature-sets. We also describe the design of the benchmark, the evaluation procedures and the data cleaning and transformations that we suggest. The results from the benchmark suggest that the recurrent neural network based approaches combined with large feature-sets work best for dynamic MER."

Chromatin compaction is also believed to be critical for the repression of homeotic genes by the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) during development. Lau et al. used mutagenesis and expression analyses to examine this gene silencing mechanism. Altering the PRC1 compaction region affected transcriptional repression and patterning of the mouse body axis. Thus, chromatin compaction may drive the stable and heritable silencing of genes involved in body patterning. Science , this issue p. 1081"
https://openalex.org/W2594112212,"Cold temperature is an important abiotic stress which negatively affects morphological development and seed production in rice (Oryza sativa L.). At the seedling stage, cold stress causes poor germination, seedling injury and poor stand establishment; and at the reproductive stage cold decreases seed yield. The Rice Diversity Panel 1 (RDP1) is a global collection of over 400 O. sativa accessions representing the five major subpopulations from the INDICA and JAPONICA varietal groups, with a genotypic dataset consisting of 700,000 SNP markers. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the RDP1 accessions for the complex, quantitatively inherited cold tolerance traits at the germination and reproductive stages, and to conduct genome-wide association (GWA) mapping to identify SNPs and candidate genes associated with cold stress at these stages. GWA mapping of the germination index (calculated as percent germination in cold divided by warm treatment) revealed 42 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with cold tolerance at the seedling stage, including 18 in the panel as a whole, seven in temperate japonica, six in tropical japonica, 14 in JAPONICA, and nine in INDICA, with five shared across all subpopulations. Twenty-two of these QTLs co-localized with 32 previously reported cold tolerance QTLs. GWA mapping of cold tolerance at the reproductive stage detected 29 QTLs, including seven associated with percent sterility, ten with seed weight per panicle, 14 with seed weight per plant and one region overlapping for two traits. Fifteen co-localized with previously reported QTLs for cold tolerance or yield components. Candidate gene ontology searches revealed these QTLs were associated with significant enrichment for genes related to with lipid metabolism, response to stimuli, response to biotic stimuli (suggesting cross-talk between biotic and abiotic stresses), and oxygen binding. Overall the JAPONICA accessions were more tolerant to cold stress than INDICA accessions."

However, it has not been possible to measure distal dendritic membrane potential and spiking in vivo over a long period of time. Moore et al. developed a technique to record the subthreshold membrane potential and spikes from neocortical distal dendrites in freely behaving animals. These recordings were very stable, providing data from a single dendrite for up to 4 days. Unexpectedly, distal dendrites generated action potentials whose firing rate was nearly five times greater than at the cell body. Science , this issue p. eaaj1497"
https://openalex.org/W3104635521,"Coherent light-matter interaction can be used to manipulate the energy levels of atoms, molecules and solids. When light with frequency {\omega} is detuned away from a resonance {\omega}o, repulsion between the photon-dressed (Floquet) states can lead to a shift of energy resonance. The dominant effect is the optical Stark shift (1/({\omega}0-{\omega})), but there is an additional contribution from the so-called Bloch-Siegert shift (1/({\omega}o+{\omega})). Although it is common in atoms and molecules, the observation of Bloch-Siegert shift in solids has so far been limited only to artificial atoms since the shifts were small (<1 {\mu}eV) and inseparable from the optical Stark shift. Here we observe an exceptionally large Bloch-Siegert shift (~10 meV) in monolayer WS2 under infrared optical driving by virtue of the strong light-matter interaction in this system. Moreover, we can disentangle the Bloch-Siegert shift entirely from the optical Stark shift, because the two effects are found to obey opposite selection rules at different valleys. By controlling the light helicity, we can confine the Bloch-Siegert shift to occur only at one valley, and the optical Stark shift at the other valley. Such a valley-exclusive Bloch-Siegert shift allows for enhanced control over the valleytronic properties in two-dimensional materials, and offers a new avenue to explore quantum optics in solids."

https://openalex.org/W2594427367,"Interactions between different phytoplankton taxa and heterotrophic bacterial communities within aquatic environments can differentially support growth of various heterotrophic bacterial species. In this study, phytoplankton diversity was studied using traditional microscopic techniques and the bacterial communities associated with phytoplankton bloom were studied using High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicons from the V1-V3 and V3-V4 hypervariable regions. Samples were collected from Lake Akersvannet, a eutrophic lake in South Norway, during the growth season from June to August 2013. Microscopic examination revealed that the phytoplankton community was mostly represented by Cyanobacteria and the dinoflagellate Ceratium hirundinella. The HTS results revealed that Proteobacteria (Alpha, Beta, and Gamma), Bacteriodetes, Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia dominated the bacterial community, with varying relative abundances throughout the sampling season. Species level identification of Cyanobacteria showed a mixed population of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, Microcystis aeruginosa and Woronichinia naegeliana. A significant proportion of the microbial community was composed of unclassified taxa which might represent locally adapted freshwater bacterial groups. Comparison of cyanobacterial species composition from HTS and microscopy revealed quantitative discrepancies, indicating a need for cross validation of results. To our knowledge, this is the first study that uses HTS methods for studying the bacterial community associated with phytoplankton blooms in a Norwegian lake. The study demonstrates the value of considering results from multiple methods when studying bacterial communities."
https://openalex.org/W2594803849,"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic metabolic disease in which the decrease or loss of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) activity results in elevated, neurotoxic levels of phenylalanine (Phe). Due to many obstacles, PAH enzyme replacement therapy is not currently an option. Treatment of PKU with an alternative enzyme, phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), was first proposed in the 1970s. However, issues regarding immunogenicity, enzyme production and mode of delivery needed to be overcome. Through the evaluation of PAL enzymes from multiple species, three potential PAL enzymes from yeast and cyanobacteria were chosen for evaluation of their therapeutic potential. The addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG, MW = 20,000), at a particular ratio to modify the protein surface, attenuated immunogenicity in an animal model of PKU. All three PEGylated PAL candidates showed efficacy in a mouse model of PKU (BTBR Pahenu2) upon subcutaneous injection. However, only PEGylated Anabaena variabilis (Av) PAL-treated mice demonstrated sustained low Phe levels with weekly injection and was the only PAL evaluated that maintained full enzymatic activity upon PEGylation. A PEGylated recombinant double mutant version of AvPAL (Cys503Ser/Cys565Ser), rAvPAL-PEG, was selected for drug development based on its positive pharmacodynamic profile and favorable expression titers. PEGylation was shown to be critical for rAvPAL-PEG efficacy as under PEGylated rAvPAL had a lower pharmacodynamic effect. rAvPAL and rAvPAL-PEG had poor stability at 4°C. L-Phe and trans-cinnamate were identified as activity stabilizing excipients. rAvPAL-PEG is currently in Phase 3 clinical trials to assess efficacy in PKU patients."
https://openalex.org/W2591744218,"The Asian citrus psyllid (ACP), Diaphorina citri Kuwayama, is one of the most important citrus pests. ACP is the vector of the phloem-limited bacteria Candidatus Liberibacter americanus and Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus, the causal agents of the devastating citrus disease huanglongbing (HLB). The management of HLB is based on the use of healthy young plants, eradication of infected plants and chemical control of the vector. RNA interference (RNAi) has proven to be a promising tool to control pests and explore gene functions. Recently, studies have reported that target mRNA knockdown in many insects can be induced through feeding with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). In the current study, we targeted the cathepsin D, chitin synthase and inhibitor of apoptosis genes of adult and nymph ACP by feeding artificial diets mixed with dsRNAs and Murraya paniculata leaves placed in dsRNAs solutions, respectively. Adult ACP mortality was positively correlated with the amount of dsRNA used. Both nymphs and adult ACP fed dsRNAs exhibited significantly increased mortality over time compared with that of the controls. Moreover, qRT-PCR analysis confirmed the dsRNA-mediated RNAi effects on target mRNAs. These results showed that RNAi can be a powerful tool for gene function studies in ACP and perhaps for HLB control."
https://openalex.org/W2591895862,"Objective To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a single CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) blood test in detecting colorectal cancer recurrence. Background Patients who have undergone curative resection for primary colorectal cancer are typically followed up with scheduled CEA testing for 5 years. Decisions to investigate further (usually by CT imaging) are based on single test results, reflecting international guidelines. Methods A secondary analysis was undertaken of data from the FACS trial (two arms included CEA testing). The composite reference standard applied included CT-CAP imaging, clinical assessment and colonoscopy. Accuracy in detecting recurrence was evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, predictive values, time-dependent area under the ROC curves, and operational performance when used prospectively in clinical practice are reported. Results Of 582 patients, 104 (17.9%) developed recurrence during the 5 year follow-up period. Applying the recommended threshold of 5μg/L achieves at best 50.0% sensitivity (95% CI: 40.1–59.9%); in prospective use in clinical practice it would lead to 56 missed recurrences (53.8%; 95% CI: 44.2–64.4%) and 89 false alarms (56.7% of 157 patients referred for investigation). Applying a lower threshold of 2.5μg/L would reduce the number of missed recurrences to 36.5% (95% CI: 26.5–46.5%) but would increase the false alarms to 84.2% (924/1097 referred). Some patients are more prone to false alarms than others—at the 5μg/L threshold, the 89 episodes of unnecessary investigation were clustered in 29 individuals. Conclusion Our results demonstrated very low sensitivity for CEA, bringing to question whether it could ever be used as an independent triage test. It is not feasible to improve the diagnostic performance of a single test result by reducing the recommended action threshold because of the workload and false alarms generated. Current national and international guidelines merit re-evaluation and options to improve performance, such as making clinical decisions on the basis of CEA trend, should be further assessed."

Moreover, chronically elevated glucose causes β-cell dysfunction, but little is known about how cells handle excess fuels to avoid toxicity. Here we sought to determine which among the candidate pathways and coupling factors best correlates with glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), define the fate of glucose in the β-cell, and identify pathways possibly involved in excess-fuel detoxification. We exposed isolated rat islets for 1 h to increasing glucose concentrations and measured various pathways and metabolites. Glucose oxidation, oxygen consumption, and ATP production correlated well with GSIS and saturated at 16 mm glucose. However, glucose utilization, glycerol release, triglyceride and glycogen contents, free fatty acid (FFA) content and release, and cholesterol and cholesterol esters increased linearly up to 25 mm glucose. Besides being oxidized, glucose was mainly metabolized via glycerol production and release and lipid synthesis (particularly FFA, triglycerides, and cholesterol), whereas glycogen production was comparatively low. Using targeted metabolomics in INS-1(832/13) cells, we found that several metabolites correlated well with GSIS, in particular some Krebs cycle intermediates, malonyl-CoA, and lower ADP levels. Glucose dose-dependently increased the dihydroxyacetone phosphate/glycerol 3-phosphate ratio in INS-1(832/13) cells, indicating a more oxidized state of NAD in the cytosol upon glucose stimulation. Overall, the data support a role for accelerated oxidative mitochondrial metabolism, anaplerosis, and malonyl-CoA/lipid signaling in β-cell metabolic signaling and suggest that a decrease in ADP levels is important in GSIS. The results also suggest that excess-fuel detoxification pathways in β-cells possibly comprise glycerol and FFA formation and release extracellularly and the diversion of glucose carbons to triglycerides and cholesterol esters.

https://openalex.org/W2594533669,"Purpose In oncology, texture features extracted from positron emission tomography with 18-fluorodeoxyglucose images (FDG-PET) are of increasing interest for predictive and prognostic studies, leading to several tens of features per tumor. To select the best features, the use of a random forest (RF) classifier was investigated. Methods Sixty-five patients with an esophageal cancer treated with a combined chemo-radiation therapy were retrospectively included. All patients underwent a pretreatment whole-body FDG-PET. The patients were followed for 3 years after the end of the treatment. The response assessment was performed 1 month after the end of the therapy. Patients were classified as complete responders and non-complete responders. Sixty-one features were extracted from medical records and PET images. First, Spearman’s analysis was performed to eliminate correlated features. Then, the best predictive and prognostic subsets of features were selected using a RF algorithm. These results were compared to those obtained by a Mann-Whitney U test (predictive study) and a univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis (prognostic study). Results Among the 61 initial features, 28 were not correlated. From these 28 features, the best subset of complementary features found using the RF classifier to predict response was composed of 2 features: metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and homogeneity from the co-occurrence matrix. The corresponding predictive value (AUC = 0.836 ± 0.105, Se = 82 ± 9%, Sp = 91 ± 12%) was higher than the best predictive results found using the Mann-Whitney test: busyness from the gray level difference matrix (P < 0.0001, AUC = 0.810, Se = 66%, Sp = 88%). The best prognostic subset found using RF was composed of 3 features: MTV and 2 clinical features (WHO status and nutritional risk index) (AUC = 0.822 ± 0.059, Se = 79 ± 9%, Sp = 95 ± 6%), while no feature was significantly prognostic according to the Kaplan-Meier analysis. Conclusions The RF classifier can improve predictive and prognostic values compared to the Mann-Whitney U test and the univariate Kaplan-Meier survival analysis when applied to several tens of features in a limited patient database."
https://openalex.org/W2594768052,"In an effort to improve health service delivery and achieve better health outcomes, the World Health Organization (WHO) has called for improved efficiency of health care systems to better use the available funding. This study aims to examine the efficiency of national health systems using longitudinal country-level data. Data on health spending per capita, infant mortality rate (IMR), under 5 mortality rate (U5MR), and life expectancy (LE) were collected from or imputed for 173 countries from 2004 through 2011. Data envelopment analyses were used to evaluate the efficiency and regression models were constructed to examine the determinants of efficiency. The average efficiency of the national health system, when examined yearly, was 78.9%, indicating a potential saving of 21.1% of health spending per capita to achieve the same level of health status for children and the entire population, if all countries performed as well as their peers. Additionally, the efficiency of the national health system varied widely among countries. On average, Africa had the lowest efficiency of 67%, while West Pacific countries had the highest efficiency of 86%. National economic status, HIV/AIDS prevalence, health financing mechanisms and governance were found to be statistically associated with the efficiency of national health systems. Taking health financing as an example, a 1% point increase of social security expenses as a percentage of total health expenditure correlated to a 1.9% increase in national health system efficiency. The study underscores the need to enhance efficiency of national health systems to meet population health needs, and highlights the importance of health financing and governance in improving the efficiency of health systems, to ultimately improve health outcomes."

The aim of this study was to investigate whether the incidence of pediatric mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) pneumonia and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia was associated with meteorological factors in Hangzhou, China. Methods A total of 36500 pneumonia patients were recruited to participate in the study. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected for the detection of MP and RSV using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) assays, respectively. We used a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) to evaluate the correlations between the MP/RSV incidence and meteorological factors. Results The detection rates of MP and RSV were 18.4% and 10.4%, respectively. There was a positive correlation between temperature and the MP infection rate, but RSV infection rate was negatively associated with temperature. Moreover, the impact of temperature on infection with RSV presented evident lag and cumulative effects. There was also an evident lag effect of temperature on the infection rate of MP; however, there was no evident cumulative effect. Conclusions In this study, the results showed meteorological factors play an important role in the incidence of these two pathogens. All these results can provide the laboratory basis for the early diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia in children."

In vivo, EBI3 is present in interfollicular cells in tonsils, perifollicular cells in the spleen, and placental syncytial trophoblasts (3.Devergne O. Coulomb-L'Herminé A. Capel F. Moussa M. Capron F.

EBI3 pairs with IL-30 (p28) to form IL-27 (4.Pflanz S. Timans J.C. Cheung J. Rosales R. Kanzler H. Gilbert J. Hibbert L. Churakova T. Travis M. Vaisberg E. Blumenschein W.M. Mattson J.D. Wagner J.L.

U.S.A. 1997; 94: 12041-12046Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Both IL-27 and IL-35 belong to the IL-6/IL-12 family of cytokines (6.Vignali D.A. Kuchroo V.K. IL-12 family cytokines: immunological playmakers.Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). IL-27 is mainly produced by activated dendritic cells and macrophages in response to Toll-like receptor ligands and pro-inflammatory cytokines (7.Pirhonen J. Sirén J. Julkunen I. Matikainen S. IFN-α regulates Toll-like receptor-mediated IL-27 gene expression in human macrophages.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2007; 82: 1185-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Its receptor comprises a unique IL-27Rα chain and the gp130 chain shared with members of the IL-6 cytokine family (Fig. 1) (8.Pflanz S. Hibbert L. Mattson J. Rosales R. Vaisberg E. Bazan J.F. Phillips J.H. McClanahan T.K. de Waal Malefyt R. Kastelein R.A. WSX-1 and glycoprotein 130 constitute a signal-transducing receptor for IL-27.J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 2225-2231Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Initially identified as a CD4+T cell activator (4.Pflanz S. Timans J.C. Cheung J. Rosales R. Kanzler H. Gilbert J.

IL-27 has pleiotropic functions, including the regulation of inflammation in multiple models of infectious diseases (9.Bosmann M. Ward P.A. Modulation of inflammation by interleukin-27.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2013; 94: 1159-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For example, it induces the secretion of IL-10 and limits inflammatory responses (10.Freitas do Rosário A.P. Lamb T. Spence P. Stephens R. Lang A. Roers A. Muller W. O'Garra A. Langhorne J. IL-27 promotes IL-10 production by effector Th1 CD4+ T cells: a critical mechanism for protection from severe immunopathology during malaria infection.J.

It also inhibits Th17 CD4+ T cell differentiation and shows promising effects in EAE models of multiple sclerosis (11.Stumhofer J.S. Laurence A. Wilson E.H. Huang E. Tato C.M. Johnson L.M. Villarino A.V. Huang Q. Yoshimura A. Sehy D. Saris C.J. O'Shea J.J. Hennighausen L. Ernst M. Hunter C.A.

Like other cytokines of the IL-12 family, IL-27 has potent anti-tumor effect in mouse models of cancer (13.Liu Z. Yu J. Carson 3rd, W. E Bai X.F. The role of IL-27 in the induction of anti-tumor cytotoxic T lymphocyte response.Am. J. Transl. Res. 2013; 5: 470-480PubMed Google Scholar). IL-35 is a composite cytokine produced by regulatory T cells (14.Li X. Mai J. Virtue A. Yin Y. Gong R. Sha X. Gutchigian S. Frisch A. Hodge I. Jiang X. Wang H. Yang X.F. IL-35 is a novel responsive anti-inflammatory cytokine: a new system of categorizing anti-inflammatory cytokines.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e33628Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Like IL-27, IL-35 has anti-inflammatory roles in models of infectious diseases and EAE. IL-35, akin to IL-10 and TGF-β, promotes the differentiation of human and mouse induced T regulatory cells (iTR35) that play a key role in infection tolerance and contribute to tumor progression (15.Collison L.W. Chaturvedi V. Henderson A.L. Giacomin P.R. Guy C. Bankoti J. Finkelstein D. Forbes K. Workman C.J. Brown S.A. Rehg J.E. Jones M.L. Ni H.T. Artis D. et al.IL-35-mediated induction of a potent regulatory T cell population.Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11: 1093-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). IL-35 induces ex vivo conversion of mouse or human B cells into IL-35 or IL-10 producing B-cells (16.Wang R.X. Yu C.R. Dambuza I.M. Mahdi R.M. Dolinska M.B. Sergeev Y.V. Wingfield P.T. Kim S.H. Egwuagu C.E. Interleukin-35 induces regulatory B cells that suppress autoimmune disease.Nat. Med. 2014; 20: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Studies using cells deficient in hematopoietin receptor chains revealed that IL-35 signals through unconventional receptors comprising IL-12Rβ2 or gp130 homo- or heterodimers (Fig. 1) (17.Collison L.W. Delgoffe G.M. Guy C.S. Vignali K.M. Chaturvedi V. Fairweather D. Satoskar A.R. Garcia K.C. Hunter C.A. Drake C.G. Murray P.J. Vignali D.A. The composition and signaling of the IL-35 receptor are unconventional.Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13: 290-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). EBI3 lacks the cysteine homologous to the residue forming the interchain disulfide bond in IL-12 and IL-23, indicating that cytokines involving EBI3 may be more unstable than their counterparts that utilize p40 (1.Jones L.L. Vignali D.A. Molecular interactions within the IL-6/IL-12 cytokine/receptor superfamily.Immunol. Res. 2011; 51: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the p28 subunit of IL-27, IL-30, which can be secreted independently of EBI3 (18.Stumhofer J.S. Tait E.D. Quinn 3rd, W.J. Hosken N. Spudy B. Goenka R. Fielding C.A. O'Hara A.C. Chen Y.

Immunol. 2010; 11: 1119-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) is an IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) ligand with pro-inflammatory activities (19.Crabé S. Guay-Giroux A. Tormo A.J. Duluc D. Lissilaa R. Guilhot F. Mavoungou-Bigouagou U. Lefouili F. Cognet I. Ferlin W. Elson G. Jeannin P. Gauchat J.F.

This suggests that injection of EBI3 or EBI3 derivatives such as EBI3-Fc fusion proteins could have therapeutic anti-inflammatory effect by favoring the formation of IL-27 and IL-35 complexes in vivo. EBI3, like p40, can be secreted independent of its cytokine subunit partners (4.Pflanz S. Timans J.C. Cheung J. Rosales R. Kanzler H. Gilbert J. Hibbert L. Churakova T. Travis M. Vaisberg E.

Pahan K.

Therefore, we investigated whether EBI3 has functions outside IL-27 or IL-35 complexes and whether such functions could adversely affect the therapeutic use of recombinant EBI3 or EBI3 derivative in inflammatory or autoimmune diseases. We observed that EBI3 can activate gp130-expressing cells by mediating IL-6 trans-signaling (Fig. 1). The B9 cell line is a mouse IL-6-dependent plasmacytoma widely used to measure mouse IL-6 biological activity (26.Diamant M. Hansen M.B. Rieneck K. Svenson M. Yasukawa K. Bendtzen K. Stimulation of the B9 hybridoma cell line by soluble interleukin-6 receptors.J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 173: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We previously generated a derivative of this cell line transfected with the IL-27Rα cDNA that responds to IL-27 (Fig. 2B, left panel) (20.Tormo A.J. Meliani Y. Beaupré L.A. Sharma M. Fritz J.H. Elson G. Crabé S. Gauchat J.F. The composite cytokine p28/cytokine-like factor 1 sustains B cell proliferation and promotes plasma cell differentiation.J. Immunol. 2013; 191: 1657-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We observed that the IL-27Rα-expressing B9 cells (B9-IL-27R) also respond in a dose-dependent manner to recombinant mEBI3 (Fig. 2B, right panel). To assess whether the observed effect reflects the capacity of mEBI3 to recruit and activate the IL-27Rα, we tested the effect of mEBI3 on the unmodified B9 cells that express only the IL-6Rα and therefore do not respond to IL-27 (Fig. 2A, left panel). Unexpectedly, these cells also proliferated in response to mEBI3 (Fig. 2A, right panel). Because mEBI3 can form a composite cytokine with the IL-12 p35 subunit (IL-35) shown to activate homodimers of the signal transducing subunit of gp130 (Fig. 1) (17.Collison L.W. Delgoffe G.M. Guy C.S. Vignali K.M. Chaturvedi V. Fairweather D. Satoskar A.R. Garcia K.C. Hunter C.A. Drake C.G. Murray P.J. Vignali D.A. The composition and signaling of the IL-35 receptor are unconventional.Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13: 290-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), we assessed the expression of p35 mRNA by B9 cells by real-time RT-PCR. No expression could be detected, suggesting that the observed proliferation was not due to the formation of IL-35 by an interaction between the exogenous EBI3 and B9-secreted p35 (data not shown). B9 cells express low levels of IL-6 mRNA and proliferate in response to soluble IL-6Rα in a dose-dependent manner (26.Diamant M. Hansen M.B. Rieneck K. Svenson M. Yasukawa K. Bendtzen K. Stimulation of the B9 hybridoma cell line by soluble interleukin-6 receptors.J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 173: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This proliferation is believed to reflect trans-signaling induced by the formation of a soluble IL-6Rα·IL-6 complex (10.Freitas do Rosário A.P. Lamb T. Spence P. Stephens R. Lang A. Roers A. Muller W. O'Garra A. Langhorne J. IL-27 promotes IL-10 production by effector Th1 CD4+ T cells: a critical mechanism for protection from severe immunopathology during malaria infection.J.

Stimulation of the B9 hybridoma cell line by soluble interleukin-6 receptors.J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 173: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether mEBI3 can substitute for IL-6Rα and promote B9 proliferation by trans-signaling (Fig. 1). Because this signaling would imply the formation of a complex between recombinant mEBI3 and B9-secreted IL-6 followed by the recruitment and activation of gp130 by this initial complex (27.Thibault V. Richards C.D. Botelho F. Gauldie J. Antibodies to rat soluble IL-6 receptor stimulate B9 hybridoma cell proliferation.FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), we first assessed the effect of blocking anti-IL-6 and anti-gp130 mAbs on EBI3-induced proliferation. Isotype-matched rat IgG was used as negative control. A marked inhibition of the mEBI3-induced B9 proliferation was observed by blocking either the gp130 receptor (Fig. 3A) or the B9-secreted IL-6 (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that both IL-6 and gp130 were involved in B9 proliferative response, supporting the hypothesis that mEBI3 could substitute for IL-6Rα in the activation of gp130 by trans-signaling (Fig. 1). We further explored the mechanism involved in the activation of B9 by mEBI3 using the mAb 25F10. This mAb, which was generated at NovImmune using the IL-6·IL-6Rα complex as immunogen, can prevent IL-6 trans-signaling (28.Lacroix M. Rousseau F. Guilhot F. Malinge P. Magistrelli G. Herren S. Jones S.A. Jones G.W. Scheller J. Lissilaa R. Kosco-Vilbois M. Johnson Z. Buatois V. Ferlin W. Novel insights into interleukin 6 (IL-6) cis- and trans-signaling pathways by differentially manipulating the assembly of the IL-6 signaling complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 26943-26953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The addition of mAb 25F10 inhibited B9-IL-27R cell proliferation induced by IL-6 but not by IL-27, included as control (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, 25F10 mAb also inhibited the proliferation of B9-IL-27R cells induced by mEBI3 (Fig. 3C). To investigate whether the observed proliferation was IL-6R-independent, we assessed the effect of blocking anti-IL-6Rα mAb on IL-6, EBI3, or IL-27-induced proliferation using the B9-IL-27R transfectants: although IL-6-induced proliferation was inhibited, either EBI3 or IL-27 proliferations were unaffected in the presence of blocking anti-IL-6R mAb (Fig. 3D). Collectively, these results suggest that mEBI3 can form a trans-signaling complex with IL-6 and that the EBI3·IL-6 and IL-6Rα·IL-6 complexes are sufficiently similar for recognition by the same mAb. In line with this hypothesis, the epitope recognized by the mAb 25F10 has been mapped near Glu-261 in the D3 mIL-6Rα domain (28.Lacroix M. Rousseau F. Guilhot F. Malinge P. Magistrelli G. Herren S.

Gascan H. IL-27 structural analysis demonstrates similarities with ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and leads to the identification of antagonistic variants.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 19420-19425Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We analyzed whether induction of B9 cell proliferation was paralleled by activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. Although 15 min of stimulation with IL-6 induced a clear STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation, no signal was observed in response to mEBI3 (Fig. 4A). Because activation of B9 by a trans-signaling mechanism involving an EBI3·IL-6 complex would require a secretion of IL-6 in the B9 culture medium unlikely to occur in 15 min, we tested the effect of longer incubation. Interestingly, overnight incubation with mEBI3 resulted in a STAT3 phosphorylation detectable by flow cytometry (Fig. 4A) or Western blot (Fig. 4C) that could be prevented by the inclusion of a blocking anti-IL-6 mAb (Fig. 4, A and C). B9 transfectants expressing IL-27Rα were used as control for the specificity of the blocking anti-IL-6 mAb (Fig. 4, B and C). Induction of STAT3 phosphorylation could be observed with EBI3 concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 2 μg/ml (Fig. 4C). These results indicate that mEBI3 can induce the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in B9 cells and confirm the implication of IL-6 in the activation of B9 cells. To assess whether mEBI3 could also induce STAT3 phosphorylation in primary mouse cells, we stimulated mouse splenocytes with IL-6, IL-27, or mEBI3 for 15 min or 16 h and analyzed STAT3 phosphorylation in CD4 T cells by flow cytometry (Fig. 5). Whereas no STAT3 activation could be detected in cells incubated with mEBI3 for 15 min, a detectable signal was observed at 16 h. This signal could be prevented by the inclusion of a blocking anti-IL-6 mAb (Fig. 5), suggesting that it was induced by a complex formed between the recombinant mEBI3 and IL-6 secreted by the splenocytes. To investigate whether the observed EBI3-induced STAT3 phosphorylation was IL-6R-independent, we assessed the effect of blocking anti-IL-6Rα mAb inclusion during the splenocyte stimulation. Although the IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation was blocked by anti-IL-6R mAb, it did not affect the EBI3 and IL-27-induced STAT3 phosphorylation (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that EBI3 can activate the JAK/STAT pathway in CD4 T cells independently of the canonical IL-6/IL-6R signaling and suggest that EBI3 can form an active complex with IL-6.Figure 5EBI3 activates STAT3 phosphorylation in CD4+ T cells, and this phosphorylation is blocked by anti-IL-6 mAb. A, mouse splenocytes were stimulated with mEBI3 (1 μg/ml), IL-27 (100 ng/ml), or IL-6 (10 ng/ml) for 15 min or 16 h with or without anti-IL-6 mAb. B, mouse splenocytes were stimulated with mEBI3 (1 μg/ml), IL-27 (100 ng/ml), or IL-6 (10 ng/ml) for 15 min or 16 h with or without anti-IL-6R mAb. The cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with APC-labeled anti-CD4 and FITC-labeled anti-pSTAT3. Fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry.

The data are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, we evaluated the binding between EBI3 and IL-6 by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 6). We generated stable HEK-293 transfectants expressing IL-6, IL-27 (i.e. co-expressing EBI3 and IL-30), or a combination of EBI3 and IL-6. Both EBI3 and IL-6 were detected in respective transfectant cell culture medium (Fig. 6A). When EBI3 was immunoprecipitated with a specific mAb, co-immunoprecipitation of IL-6 could be detected (Fig. 6A, bottom panel). As expected, no signal for IL-6 was observed when the co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed using medium containing IL-6 alone or IL-27 (Fig. 6A, bottom panel). To investigate whether both mouse and human EBI3 could bind IL-6, His-Biotin-tagged mouse or human EBI3 was incubated with unconjugated mouse or human IL-6, and the mix was subjected to IMAC. Co-immunoprecipitation of EBI3 and IL-6 could be detected using HRP-labeled streptavidin to reveal EBI3 and anti-IL-6 to detect IL-6 (Fig. 6B). As expected, no signal was observed when co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed using medium containing only IL-6 (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that both mouse and human EBI3 can bind IL-6. We further proved binding of EBI3 with IL-6 with SPR measurements. EBI3 was covalently immobilized on the surface of the SPR chip and incubated with IL-6. A shift of ∼3.5 nm was observed with IL-6 (Fig. 7, A and D). When EBI3 immobilized on the SPR chip was incubated with identical concentrations of IL-11, a background shift of 0.8 nm was observed (Fig. 7, C and D). When equal concentrations of soluble G-CSFR were immobilized on the surface by the same manner, a background shift of 0.8 nm was observed with IL-6 (Fig. 7, B and D). The significantly larger SPR response for EBI3-IL-6 confirms the selectivity of interaction between these proteins. We then used SPR to estimate the dissociation constant (KD) of the EBI3·IL-6 complex, which was measured at 4.1 μm (Fig. 7E). These data further indicate that EBI3 can bind IL-6. Recombinant fusion proteins between sIL-6Ra·IL-6 (“hyper-IL-6”) in which the complex is stabilized by a flexible linker have been widely used to demonstrate that the sIL-6Ra·IL-6 complex can activate cells expressing only gp130 (“trans-signaling”) (Fig. 1) and to investigate the role of IL-6 trans-signaling (30.Peters M. Blinn G. Solem F. Fischer M. Meyer zum Büschenfelde K.H. Rose-John S. In vivo and in vitro activities of the gp130-stimulating designer cytokine hyper-IL-6.J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3575-3581PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore assessed whether a structurally analogous fusion between EBI3 and IL-6 could, like hyper-IL-6, activate gp130-expressing Ba/F3 cells. Ba/F3 was chosen because this IL-3-dependent cell line does not express IL-6Rα, can be rendered sensitive to other cytokines by transfection with the relevant receptor cDNA, and has been widely used to study type I cytokine receptors (31.Fischer M. Goldschmitt J. Peschel C. Brakenhoff J.P. Kallen K.J. Wollmer A. Grötzinger J. Rose-John S. I. A bioactive designer cytokine for human hematopoietic progenitor cell expansion.Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 142-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). As expected, expressions of gp130 rendered Ba/F3 cells sensitive to hyper-IL-6, as well as to IL-27, because Ba/F3 spontaneously express IL-27Rα (32.Sprecher C.A. Grant F.J. Baumgartner J.W.

No proliferation in response to either IL-6 (Fig. 8A, left panel) or EBI3 alone could be detected (Fig. 8A, right panel), confirming that these transfectants do not constitutively express either IL-6 or IL-6Rα and are therefore suitable for investigating the trans-signaling capacity of the EBI3-IL-6 fusion.

However, the specific physiological role of this receptor has yet to be identified, and the mechanisms regulating its activity and cell surface availability also remain enigmatic. In the present study, we investigated the trafficking properties of GPRC6A by use of both a classical antibody feeding internalization assay in which cells were visualized using confocal microscopy and a novel internalization assay that is based on real-time measurements of fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Both assays revealed that GPRC6A predominantly undergoes constitutive internalization, whereas the agonist-induced effects were imperceptible. Moreover, postendocytic sorting was investigated by assessing the co-localization of internalized GPRC6A with selected Rab protein markers. Internalized GPRC6A was mainly co-localized with the early endosome marker Rab5 and the long loop recycling endosome marker Rab11 and to a much lesser extent with the late endosome marker Rab7. This suggests that upon agonist-independent internalization, GPRC6A is recycled via the Rab11-positive slow recycling pathway, which may be responsible for ensuring a persistent pool of GPRC6A receptors at the cell surface despite chronic agonist exposure. Distinct trafficking pathways have been reported for several of the class C receptors, and our results thus substantiate that non-canonical trafficking mechanisms are a common feature for the nutrient-sensing class C family that ensure functional receptors in the cell membrane despite prolonged agonist exposure.

https://openalex.org/W2594562078,"Background Stroke in cancer patients is not rare but is a devastating event with high mortality. However, the predictors of mortality in stroke patients with cancer have not been well addressed. D-dimer could be a useful predictor because it can reflect both thromboembolic events and advanced stages of cancer. Aim In this study, we evaluate the possibility of D-dimer as a predictor of 30-day mortality in stroke patients with active cancer. Methods We included 210 ischemic stroke patients with active cancer. The 30-day mortality data were collected by reviewing medical records. We also collected follow-up D-dimer levels in 106 (50%) participants to evaluate the effects of treatment response on D-dimer levels. Results Of the 210 participants, 30-day mortality occurred in 28 (13%) patients. Higher initial NIHSS scores, D-dimer levels, and CRP levels as well as frequent cryptogenic mechanism, systemic metastasis, multiple vascular territory lesion, hemorrhagic transformation, and larger infarct volume were related to 30-day mortality. In the multivariate analysis, D-dimer [adjusted OR (aOR) = 2.19; 95% CI, 1.46–3.28, P < 0.001] predicted 30-day mortality after adjusting for confounders. The initial NIHSS score (aOR = 1.07; 95% CI, 1.00–1.14, P = 0.043) and hemorrhagic transformation (aOR = 3.02; 95% CI, 1.10–8.29, P = 0.032) were also significant independent of D-dimer levels. In the analysis of D-dimer changes after treatment, the mortality group showed no significant decrease in D-dimer levels, despite treatment, while the survivor group showed the opposite response. Conclusions D-dimer levels may predict 30-day mortality in acute ischemic stroke patients with active cancer."

This study presents the implementation of a methodology capable of overcoming the visual challenges of fluorescent microscopy for diagnostic neuropathology by using automated digital image analysis, with long term goal of providing unbiased quantitative analyses of multiplexed biomarkers for solid tissue neuropathology. In this study, we validated PTBP1, a putative biomarker for glioma, and tested the extent to which immunofluorescent microscopy combined with automated and unbiased image analysis would permit the utility of PTBP1 as a biomarker to distinguish diagnostically challenging surgical biopsies. As a paradigm, we utilized second resections from patients diagnosed either with reactive brain changes (pseudoprogression) and recurrent glioblastoma (true progression). Our image analysis workflow was capable of removing background autofluorescence and permitted quantification of DAPI-PTBP1 positive cells. PTBP1-positive nuclei, and the mean intensity value of PTBP1 signal in cells. Traditional pathological interpretation was unable to distinguish between groups due to unacceptably high discordance rates amongst expert neuropathologists. Our data demonstrated that recurrent glioblastoma showed more DAPI-PTBP1 positive cells and a higher mean intensity value of PTBP1 signal compared to resections from second surgeries that showed only reactive gliosis. Our work demonstrates the potential of utilizing automated image analysis to overcome the challenges of implementing fluorescent microscopy in diagnostic neuropathology."

Although treatment of people living with HIV (PLHIV) with antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces TB-associated morbidity and mortality, incident TB can occur while on ART. We estimated incidence and characterized factors associated with TB after ART initiation in Nigeria.We analyzed retrospective cohort data from a nationally representative sample of adult patients on ART. Data were abstracted from 3,496 patient records, and analyses were weighted and controlled for a complex survey design. We performed domain analyses on patients without documented TB disease and used a Cox proportional hazard model to assess factors associated with TB incidence after ART.At ART initiation, 3,350 patients (95.8%) were not receiving TB treatment. TB incidence after ART initiation was 0.57 per 100 person-years, and significantly higher for patients with CD4<50/μL (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR]: 4.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4-12.7) compared with CD4≥200/μL. Patients with suspected but untreated TB at ART initiation and those with a history of prior TB were more likely to develop incident TB (AHR: 12.2, 95% CI: 4.5-33.5 and AHR: 17.6, 95% CI: 3.5-87.9, respectively).Incidence of TB among PLHIV after ART initiation was low, and predicted by advanced HIV, prior TB, and suspected but untreated TB. Study results suggest a need for improved TB screening and diagnosis, particularly among high-risk PLHIV initiating ART, and reinforce the benefit of early ART and other TB prevention efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2594062079,"Frogs' outstanding jumping ability has been associated with a high power output from the leg extensor muscles. Two main theories have emerged to explain the high power output of the frog leg extensor muscles, either (i) the contractile conditions of all leg extensor muscles are optimized in terms of muscle length and speed of shortening, or (ii) maximal power is achieved through a dynamic catch mechanism that uncouples fibre shortening from the corresponding muscle-tendon unit shortening. As in vivo instantaneous power generation in frog hind limb muscles during jumping has never been measured directly, it is hard to distinguish between the two theories. In this study, we determined the instantaneous variable power output of the plantaris longus (PL) of Lithobates pipiens (also known as Rana pipiens), by directly measuring the in vivo force, length change, and speed of muscle and fibre shortening in near maximal jumps. Fifteen near maximal jumps (> 50cm in horizontal distance) were analyzed. High instantaneous peak power in PL (536 ± 47 W/kg) was achieved by optimizing the contractile conditions in terms of the force-length but not the force-velocity relationship, and by a dynamic catch mechanism that decouples fascicle shortening from muscle-tendon unit shortening. We also found that the extra-muscular free tendon likely amplifies the peak power output of the PL by modulating fascicle shortening length and shortening velocity for optimum power output, but not by releasing stored energy through recoiling as the tendon only started recoiling after peak PL power had been achieved."

This article contributes to that goal by testing the effectiveness of nudges intended to prevent the purchase of 'incompatible' digital products (i.e., those which cannot be used with the devices owned by consumers or the systems they operate). We ran a computerised lab experiment (n = 626) examining three types of nudges, the effects of age and education, and interaction effects between these variables and the nudges. Results show that emotive warning messages and placing incompatibility information at the checkout page rather than earlier in the purchasing process were effective in reducing the purchase of incompatible goods. Age was also a relevant factor: older participants were more likely to purchase incompatible goods. In addition, there was an interaction effect between all nudges and age: two nudges exacerbated the effect of age, while another mitigated it. These results suggest nudges can be an effective policy tool, confirm a generational gap in online behaviour, and highlight how nudges can moderate the effect of socio-demographic variables."
https://openalex.org/W2594227676,"In vitro culture of ovarian granulosa cells and theca cells has been very important for our understanding of their function and regulation. One of the most eagerly sought attributes of cell culture is the use of chemically-defined conditions. However, even under such in vitro conditions cell behaviour could differ from the in vivo situation because of differences in oxygen tension, nutrients, adhesion matrix and other factors. To examine this further we compared the transcriptomes of both granulosa cells and cells from the theca interna that were cultured in what are arguably the best in vitro conditions for maintaining the 'follicular' phenotypes of both tissue types, as displayed by their respective freshly-isolated counterparts. The array data analysed are from recently published data and use the same sizes of bovine follicles (small antral 3-6 mm) and the same Affymetrix arrays. We conducted analysis using Partek, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and GOEAST. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering clearly separated the in vivo from the in vitro groups for both cells types and transcriptomes were more homogeneous upon culture. In both cell cultures behaviours associated with cell adhesion, migration and interaction with matrix or substrate were more abundant. However, the pathways involved generally differed between the two cell types. With the thecal cultures a gene expression signature of an immune response was more abundant, probably by leukocytes amongst the cells cultured from the theca interna. These results indicate differences between in vivo and in vitro that should be considered when interpreting in vitro data."

Our study aimed to assess the prognosis value of lactate in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia. Methods This retrospective observational study included out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia in four ICUs. Lactate levels were compared at different times during the first 24 hours according to outcome at ICU discharge and to the type of death (multiorgan or neurologic failure). Results Two hundred and seventy-two patients were included, 89 good outcome and 183 poor outcome. In the latter group, 171 patients died, from multiorgan failure in 30% and neurologic failure in 70%. Lactate levels were higher in the poor compared to the good outcome patients at admission (5.4 (3.3–9.4) vs. 2.2 (1.5–3.6) mmol/L; p<0.01), 12 hours (2.5 (1.6–4.7) vs. 1.4 (1.0–2.2) mmol/L; p<0.01) and 24 hours (1.8 (1.1–2.8) vs. 1.3 (0.9–2.1) mmol/L; p<0.01). Patients succumbing from multiorgan failure exhibited higher lactate levels compared to those dying from neurologic failure at admission (7.9 (3.9–12.0) vs. 5.2 (3.3–8.8) mmol/L; p<0.01), H12 (4.9 (2.1–8.9) vs. 2.2 (1.4–3.4) mmol/L; p<0.01) and H24 (3.3 (1.8–5.5) vs. 1.4 (1.1–2.5) mmol/L; p<0.01). Initial lactate levels showed an increasing proportion of poor outcome from the first to fourth quartile. Conclusions After out-of-hospital cardiac arrest treated with therapeutic hypothermia, lactate levels during the first 24 hours seem linked with ICU outcome. Patients dying from multiorgan failure exhibit higher initial lactate concentrations than patients succumbing from neurological failure."

We further demonstrate that specific GAS clinical isolates display high affinity for the D-domain of hFg, and this interaction allowed for subsequent surface binding of human-host plasminogen (hPg) to the E-domain of hFg. This GAS surface-bound hPg is then activated by GAS-secreted streptokinase, leading to the generation of an invasive proteolytic bacterial surface.

https://openalex.org/W2592584230,"Chemokines are important in macrophage recruitment and the progression of atherosclerosis. The 'M3' chemokine binding protein inactivates key chemokines involved in atherosclerosis (e.g. CCL2, CCL5 and CX3CL1). We aimed to determine the effect of M3 on plaque development and composition. In vitro chemotaxis studies confirmed that M3 protein inhibited the activity of chemokines CCL2, CCL5 and CX3CL1 as primary human monocyte migration as well as CCR2-, CCR5- and CX3CR1-directed migration was attenuated by M3. In vivo, adenoviruses encoding M3 (AdM3) or green fluorescence protein (AdGFP; control) were infused systemically into apolipoprotein (apo)-E-/- mice. Two models of atherosclerosis development were used in which the rate of plaque progression was varied by diet including: (1) a 'rapid promotion' model (6-week high-fat-fed) and (2) a 'slow progression' model (12-week chow-fed). Plasma chemokine activity was suppressed in AdM3-infused mice as indicated by significantly less monocyte migration towards AdM3 mouse plasma ex vivo (29.56%, p = 0.014). In the 'slow progression' model AdM3 mice had reduced lesion area (45.3%, p = 0.035) and increased aortic smooth muscle cell α-actin expression (60.3%, p = 0.014). The reduction in lesion size could not be explained by changes in circulating inflammatory monocytes as they were higher in the AdM3 group. In the 'rapid promotion' model AdM3 mice had no changes in plaque size but reduced plaque macrophage content (46.8%, p = 0.006) and suppressed lipid deposition in thoracic aortas (66.9%, p<0.05). There was also a reduction in phosphorylated p65, the active subunit of NF-κb, in the aortas of AdM3 mice (37.3%, p<0.0001). M3 inhibited liver CCL2 concentrations in both models with no change in CCL5 or systemic chemokine levels. These findings show M3 causes varying effects on atherosclerosis progression and plaque composition depending on the rate of lesion progression. Overall, our studies support a promising role for chemokine inhibition with M3 for the treatment of atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2592532889,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a devastative neurodegenerative disease characterized by selective loss of motoneurons. While several breakthroughs have been made in identifying ALS genetic defects, the detailed molecular mechanisms are still unclear. These genetic defects involve in numerous biological processes, which converge to a common destiny: motoneuron degeneration. In addition, the common comorbid Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) further complicates the investigation of ALS etiology. In this study, we aimed to explore the protein-protein interaction network built on known ALS-causative genes to identify essential proteins and common downstream proteins between classical ALS and ALS+FTD (classical ALS + ALS/FTD) groups. The results suggest that classical ALS and ALS+FTD share similar essential protein set (VCP, FUS, TDP-43 and hnRNPA1) but have distinctive functional enrichment profiles. Thus, disruptions to these essential proteins might cause motoneuron susceptible to cellular stresses and eventually vulnerable to proteinopathies. Moreover, we identified a common downstream protein, ubiquitin-C, extensively interconnected with ALS-causative proteins (22 out of 24) which was not linked to ALS previously. Our in silico approach provides the computational background for identifying ALS therapeutic targets, and points out the potential downstream common ground of ALS-causative mutations."

To evaluate a potential correlate of protection, we measured the ability of participant sera to inhibit growth of 3D7 and FVO strains in vitro using high-throughput growth inhibition assay (GIA) testing. Sera from 400 children randomized to receive either malaria vaccine or a control rabies vaccine were assessed at baseline and over two annual malaria transmission seasons after immunization. Baseline GIA against vaccine strain 3D7 and FVO strain was similar in both groups, but more children in the malaria vaccine group than in the control group had 3D7 and FVO GIA activity ≥15% 30 days after the last vaccination (day 90) (49% vs. 16%, p<0.0001; and 71.8% vs. 60.4%, p = 0.02). From baseline to day 90, 3D7 GIA in the vaccine group was 7.4 times the mean increase in the control group (p<0.0001). In AMA1 vaccinees, 3D7 GIA activity subsequently returned to baseline one year after vaccination (day 364) and did not correlate with efficacy in the extended efficacy time period to day 730. In Cox proportional hazards regression models with time-varying covariates, there was a slight suggestion of an association between 3D7 GIA activity and increased risk of clinical malaria between day 90 and day 240. We conclude that vaccination with this AMA1-based malaria vaccine increased inhibition of parasite growth, but this increase was not associated with allele-specific efficacy in the first malaria season. These results provide a framework for testing functional immune correlates of protection against clinical malaria in field trials, and will help to guide similar analyses for next-generation malaria vaccines.

https://openalex.org/W2594384803,"A new methodology based on tensor algebra that uses a higher order singular value decomposition to perform three-dimensional voxel reconstruction from a series of temporal images obtained using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is proposed. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to robustly extract the spatial and temporal image features and simultaneously de-noise the datasets. Tumour segmentation on enhanced scaled (ES) images performed using a fuzzy C-means (FCM) cluster algorithm is compared with that achieved using the proposed tensorial framework. The proposed algorithm explores the correlations between spatial and temporal features in the tumours. The multi-channel reconstruction enables improved breast tumour identification through enhanced de-noising and improved intensity consistency. The reconstructed tumours have clear and continuous boundaries; furthermore the reconstruction shows better voxel clustering in tumour regions of interest. A more homogenous intensity distribution is also observed, enabling improved image contrast between tumours and background, especially in places where fatty tissue is imaged. The fidelity of reconstruction is further evaluated on the basis of five new qualitative metrics. Results confirm the superiority of the tensorial approach. The proposed reconstruction metrics should also find future applications in the assessment of other reconstruction algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W2592031452,"Background Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has been providing healthcare in Afghanistan since 1981 including specialized health services for trauma patients in Kunduz Trauma Center (KTC) from 2011. On October 3rd, 2015, a US airstrike hit the KTC, killing 42 people including 14 MSF staff. This study aims to demonstrate the impact on healthcare provision, after hospital destruction, by assessing the extent of care provided for trauma and injuries by the MSF KTC and to report on treatment outcomes from January 2014 to June 2015, three months prior to the bombing. Methods This is a descriptive, retrospective review of hospital records. All patients with traumatic injuries registered in the Emergency Department (ED) or hospitalized in In-Patients Department (IPD) and/or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of KTC between January 2014 and June 2015 were included in the study. Results A total of 35647 patients were registered in KTC during the study period. 3199 patients registered in the ED were children aged <5 years and 310 of them were admitted including 47 to the ICU. 77.5% patients were from Kunduz province and the remaining were from other provinces. The average length of stay was 7.3 days and 3.3 days while the bed occupancy rate was an average 91.1% and 75.8% in IPD and ICU, respectively. Of 4605 IPD patients, 105 (2.3%) developed complications. Among those admitted to the ICU, 12.6% patients died. About one-third surgical interventions were carried out on an urgent basis and the major proportion (45.8%) of surgical procedures was wound surgery followed by orthopedic surgery (27.0%). Conclusions This study highlights the high burden of traumatic injuries in Kunduz province and MSF Trauma Center’s contribution to saving lives, preventing disabilities and alleviating suffering among adults and children within the region. The bombing and destruction of KTC has resulted in a specific gap in critical healthcare services for the local communities in the health system of this war-ravaged region. This suggests the urgent need for reconstruction and re-opening of the center."

To modulate and evade host immune systems, these yersiniae inject effector proteins into host macrophages. One such protein, the serine/threonine kinase YopO (YpkA in Yersinia pestis), uses monomeric actin as bait to recruit and phosphorylate host actin polymerization-regulating proteins, including the actin-severing protein gelsolin, to disrupt actin filaments and thus impair phagocytosis. However, the YopO phosphorylation sites on gelsolin and the consequences of YopO-mediated phosphorylation on actin remodeling have yet to be established. Here we determined the effects of YopO-mediated phosphorylation on gelsolin and identified its phosphorylation sites by mass spectrometry. YopO phosphorylated gelsolin in the linker region between gelsolin homology domains G3 and G4, which, in the absence of calcium, are compacted but adopt an open conformation in the presence of calcium, enabling actin binding and severing. Using phosphomimetic and phosphodeletion gelsolin mutants, we found that YopO-mediated phosphorylation partially mimics calcium-dependent activation of gelsolin, potentially contributing to a reduction in filamentous actin and altered actin dynamics in phagocytic cells. In summary, this work represents the first report of the functional outcome of serine/threonine phosphorylation in gelsolin regulation and provides critical insight into how YopO disrupts normal gelsolin function to alter host actin dynamics and thus cripple phagocytosis.

Gelsolin comprises six gelsolin homology domains (G1–G6), which, in the absence of calcium, exist in a compact globular arrangement (8Burtnick L.D. Koepf E.K. Grimes J. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I.

In the presence of micromolar concentrations of calcium, gelsolin undergoes large conformational changes to adopt an open conformation in which the 47-residue-long linker between G3 and G4 extends, allowing the two halves (G1-G3 and G4-G6) to bind the barbed ends of actin filaments, exposing the major actin-binding surfaces on G1, G2-G3, and G4 (9Robinson R.C.

Biol. 2002; 324: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Activated gelsolin binds to the side of an actin filament and severs that filament into two smaller polymers while capping the barbed end of one-half of the severed filament. The binding of polyphosphoinositides (PPIs) to gelsolin (particularly PIP2) uncaps gelsolin from the barbed end to re-enable growth of the actin filament (11Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. Modulation of gelsolin function by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate.Nature. 1987; 325: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Besides regulation by calcium and PIP2, gelsolin can also be regulated by pH, proteolysis, and phosphorylation. Gelsolin undergoes calcium-independent activation below pH 6 (12Lamb J.A. Allen P.G. Tuan B.Y. Janmey P.A. Modulation of gelsolin function. Activation at low pH overrides Ca2+ requirement.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8999-9004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Caspase-3, a critical mediator of apoptosis, cleaves gelsolin in the linker region between domains 3 and 4, giving rise to an N-terminal gelsolin fragment (residues 1–352) that is pro-apoptotic (13Kothakota S. Azuma T. Reinhard C. Klippel A. Tang J. Chu K. McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Koths K. Kwiatkowski D.J. Williams L.T. Caspase-3-generated fragment of gelsolin: effector of morphological change in apoptosis.Science. 1997; 278: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). Gelsolin is phosphorylated by the tyrosine kinase c-Src primarily at Tyr-438 in the domain G4. Artificial phosphorylation of plasma gelsolin at its N terminus removes its dependence on calcium activation (14Takiguchi K. Yamashiro-Matsumura S. Matsumura F. Artificial phosphorylation removes gelsolin's dependence on calcium.Cell Struct. Funct. 2000; 25: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In osteoclasts, proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2) phosphorylates gelsolin on tyrosine residues, reducing gelsolin-actin interactions while increasing the association of gelsolin with PIP2 (15Wang Q. Xie Y. Du Q.S. Wu X.J. Feng X. Mei L. McDonald J.M. Xiong W.C. Regulation of the formation of osteoclastic actin rings by proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 interacting with gelsolin.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Our recent work has shown that YopO kinase from Yersinia phosphorylates human gelsolin through a mechanism that involves the formation of a ternary complex with actin (16Lee W.L. Grimes J.M. Robinson R.C. Yersinia effector YopO uses actin as bait to phosphorylate proteins that regulate actin polymerization.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Yersinia bacteria cause a range of human diseases, including gastrointestinal syndromes (Yersinia enterocolitica), Far East scarlet-like fever (Yersinia pseudotuberculosis), and the plague (Yersinia pestis). Pathogenic Yersinia species use a type III secretion system to inject effector proteins (Yops) into host macrophages. These comprise six proteins, YopO/YpkA, YopH, YopM, YopE, YopT, and YopJ, that collectively inhibit phagocytosis and reorient the host immune responses (17Cornelis G.R. Boland A. Boyd A.P. Geuijen C. Iriarte M. Neyt C. Sory M.P. Stainier I. The virulence plasmid of Yersinia, an antihost genome.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1315-1352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). YopO, also known as YpkA in Y. enterocolitica, harbors a serine/threonine kinase domain (18Galyov E.E. Håkansson S. Forsberg A. Wolf-Watz H. A secreted protein kinase of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis is an indispensable virulence determinant.Nature. 1993; 361: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and a guanidine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI)-like domain (19Prehna G. Ivanov M.I. Bliska J.B. Stebbins C.E. Yersinia virulence depends on mimicry of host Rho-family nucleotide dissociation inhibitors.Cell. 2006; 126: 869-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The kinase activity of YopO is activated in the host cytosol upon binding to actin (20Trasak C. Zenner G. Vogel A. Yüksekdag G. Rost R. Haase I. Fischer M. Israel L. Imhof A. Linder S. Schleicher M. Aepfelbacher M. Yersinia protein kinase YopO is activated by a novel G-actin binding process.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2268-2277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Actin becomes sandwiched between the serine/threonine kinase domain and the GDI-like domain, which stabilizes the kinase active site in an active conformation (16Lee W.L. Grimes J.M. Robinson R.C. Yersinia effector YopO uses actin as bait to phosphorylate proteins that regulate actin polymerization.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Actin-binding proteins are recruited to YopO-actin through the bound actin to form ternary complexes, some of which are phosphorylated by YopO, including Ena/VASP family proteins, DIAPH1, WASP, and gelsolin (16Lee W.L. Grimes J.M. Robinson R.C. Yersinia effector YopO uses actin as bait to phosphorylate proteins that regulate actin polymerization.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, the phosphorylation sites on the phosphorylated substrates and their consequences on actin remodeling have yet to be examined. In this study, we determined the functional implications of gelsolin phosphorylation by YopO. We identified the phosphorylation sites on gelsolin by mass spectrometry and validated these sites by in vitro phosphorylation assays. Molecular dynamics simulations on the modeled phosphorylated gelsolin indicate that phosphorylation by YopO contributes to the instability of inactive gelsolin. Furthermore, actin polymerization assays of phosphomimetic mutants of gelsolin confirm that phosphorylation by YopO confers on gelsolin Ca2+-independent activation. Thus, these findings suggest how YopO may circumvent the native calcium-signaling pathways for gelsolin activation to manipulate the host actin cytoskeleton and resist phagocytosis. To identify the YopO phosphorylation sites on gelsolin, we carried out an in vitro phosphorylation assay of gelsolin by YopO in the presence of actin and analyzed the modifications by LC-MS/MS. Phosphorylation sites were identified at Ser-381, Ser-384, and Ser-385 (numbering corresponds to plasma gelsolin). These residues lie in the linker region between the gelsolin domains G3 and G4 (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). To validate these sites, phospho-deletion mutants of gelsolin, in which the respective serine residues were mutated to alanine, were generated (supplemental Table S1) and tested for radioactive γ-32P incorporation in the presence of YopO and Sf9 actin. In comparison with wild-type (WT) gelsolin, the triple mutant TM (381AYLAA385) displayed the least phosphorylation, and the double mutant DM3 (381AYLSA385) had a similar level of phosphorylation as TM (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S2). Both TM and DM3 possess mutations at positions 381 and 385, indicating that YopO readily phosphorylates these residues in WT gelsolin. The double mutant DM2 (381SYLAA385) showed a significant reduction in phosphorylation, whereas DM1 (381AYLAS385) had only a slight attenuation. These data suggest that Ser-385 is the major phosphorylation site, based on the reduction in incorporation of radioactivity observed for the mutants TM and DM3, whereas Ser-381 and Ser-384 are minor phosphorylation sites. Sequence alignments of gelsolin across species revealed the conservation of Ser-385 across human, mouse, rat, pig, horse, and bovine but not in chicken (Fig. 1C). Chickens are rarely transmission hosts for Yersinia (21Heroven A.K. Dersch P. Coregulation of host-adapted metabolism and virulence by pathogenic yersiniae.Front. Cell. Infect. Microbiol. 2014; 4: 146Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To obtain insight into the structural implications that could arise from phosphorylation at Ser-381 and Ser-385, we modeled their positions in the crystal structure of full-length inactive gelsolin (Fig. 2A) (PDB code 3FFN (22Nag S. Ma Q. Wang H. Chumnarnsilpa S. Lee W.L. Larsson M. Kannan B. Hernandez-Valladares M. Burtnick L.D. Robinson R.C. Ca2+ binding by domain 2 plays a critical role in the activation and stabilization of gelsolin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 13713-13718Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar)). The residues that lie in the vicinity of these serines, as derived from the inactive structure of full-length human cytoplasmic gelsolin (PDB code 3FFN), are tabulated in supplemental Table S2. Ser-381 packs against G3, lying in close proximity to the negatively charged Glu-358 and bulky Trp-369 on G3 at distances of 3.8 and 4.7 Å, respectively. Ser-381 also lies in close proximity to the negatively charged residues Asp-371 and Glu-374 on the G3-G4 linker, at distances of 2.9 and 4.2 Å, respectively. Likewise, Ser-385 packs against G1 and lies in close proximity to the charged residues Lys-72 (4.3 Å) and Asp-84 (6.3 Å) and hydrophobic residues Tyr-133 and Val-74 in G1. We hypothesized that the introduction of negative charges by phosphorylation, coupled with steric hindrance from the much bulkier phosphate groups, may induce repulsion of G1 and G3. To test this hypothesis, we carried out molecular dynamics simulations with calcium-free WT gelsolin and the phosphorylated model (based on PDB code 3FFN) to verify that phosphorylation of these sites results in instability to the compact form of calcium-free inactive gelsolin. Although WT gelsolin remained stable for 250 ns following a 50-ns equilibration, gelsolin that has been phosphorylated at Ser-381, Ser-384, and Ser-385 consistently increased its radius of gyration (Rg) (Fig. 2B), and the distance between the centers of the masses of G1–G3 and G4–G6 during this time period (Fig. 2C), indicating a destabilizing effect by phosphorylation on the inactive conformation. Size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle light scattering experiments confirmed that the phosphomimetic triple mutant (PM5, S381D/S384D/S385D), where the serines were mutated to aspartic acids to mimic phosphorylation, had higher R(avg) (geometric and hydrodynamic radius) than WT gelsolin, supporting the MD simulation data that predicted that the phosphorylated form of gelsolin adopts a more extended conformation than the WT (supplemental Table S3). To test the effect of phosphorylation on the gelsolin-actin interaction, in vitro-phosphorylated gelsolin was tested for its ability to sever actin filaments via a sedimentation assay. Under calcium-free conditions, gelsolin, phosphorylated by YopO WT, was active in severing actin filaments, as judged by the appearance of actin in the soluble fraction, compared with the non-phosphorylated gelsolin, across a range of gelsolin concentrations (Fig. 3A). In the presence of calcium (1.0 mm), both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated gelsolin was observed to sever actin to a similar extent as revealed by comparing the ratios of actin in the soluble versus pellet fractions (Ca WT YopO versus Ca KD YopO) (Fig. 3B). In an attempt to validate these results, a more extensive set of phosphomimetic mutants of gelsolin were created, where the serines were mutated to aspartic acid as follows: PM1 (S381D/S385D); PM2 (S381D); PM3 (S385D); PM4 (S384D); and PM5 (S381D/S384D/S385D). We measured the decrease in pyrenyl fluorescence of F-actin to compare the activities of WT gelsolin and phosphomimetic mutants on the depolymerization of actin. At saturating calcium concentrations (1.0 mm), both WT and the phosphomimetic mutants exhibit similar depolymerizing kinetics (Fig. 4). However, in calcium-free conditions (1.5 mm EGTA), WT gelsolin remained inactive, yet the triple phosphomimetic mutant (PM5, S381D/S384D/S385D) displayed pronounced actin depolymerization activity.Figure 4Pyrene actin depolymerization assay with gelsolin phosphomimetic mutants in EGTA conditions. Polymerized F-actin (12 μm) was incubated with different gelsolin mutants (6 μm) in 1.5 mm EGTA or 1.0 mm calcium. The loss of pyrenyl fluorescence was measured. In EGTA, the triple mutant PM5 is more active at severing actin filaments, compared with WT and the other mutants. In calcium, phosphomimetic mutants and WT depolymerize actin filaments to similar extents.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Following this, the severing activities of WT gelsolin and PM5 were compared in an actin sedimentation assay (Fig. 5A). At saturating calcium levels (1.0 mm), PM5 severed and distributed actin into a soluble fraction similar to WT gelsolin, across a range of protein concentrations. However, in the absence of calcium, although WT gelsolin did not sever actin significantly, a substantial decrease in the pelletable actin fraction and a corresponding increase of actin in the supernatant were observed for the mutant PM5 (S381D/S384D/S385D) across the tested concentrations of gelsolin. Furthermore, PM5 appears to partition into the pellet fraction and co-sediment with F-actin, which may suggest that PM5 (in EGTA) preferentially severs and caps F-actin over sequestering G-actin. A slight redistribution of actin into the soluble fraction was detected with WT gelsolin in calcium-free conditions, possibly due to the residual activity of gelsolin. The proportion of actin in the pellet or soluble fraction in the presence of different concentrations of gelsolin is plotted in Fig. 5B. These data demonstrate that the incorporation of acidic residues into the linker region of gelsolin either reduces or removes its calcium requirement for activity. These data prompted us to further investigate the activities of the phosphomimetic mutants at different calcium concentrations (Fig. 6). A pyrene actin depolymerization assay was carried out against different calcium concentrations, in which the pyrene fluorescence was measured after 3 h upon addition of the various gelsolin constructs to F-actin. The value along the y axis is the measure of the fraction of F-actin remaining in the sample upon depolymerization by gelsolin. The y axis represents the percentage of actin that remains as F-actin following depolymerization by gelsolin. A fit to the data with the Hill equation (Fig. 6) yields Kd values for the calcium requirement for gelsolin activity of 0.37 μm for WT, 0.23 μm for PM1, 0.33 μm for PM2, 0.27 μm for PM3, 0.36 μm for PM4, and 0.11 μm for PM5, suggesting that PM5 (S381D/S384D/S385D) and PM1 (S381D/S385D) were substantially more active at depolymerizing actin than WT or other mutants at lower calcium concentrations. At intermediate concentrations of calcium, there is a small but significant increase in activity for PM3. At calcium concentrations above 0.7 μm, the activities of WT and phosphomimetic mutants were indistinguishable, agreeing with the depolymerization kinetics (Fig. 4). These biochemical results, together with structural modeling, suggest that the introduction of negative charges and the steric hindrance destabilizes the inactive closed conformation of gelsolin, paralleling calcium activation, where the binding of calcium destabilizes the inactive conformation. Because gelsolin is phosphorylated by YopO in its active actin-bound form, we hypothesize that the phosphorylated gelsolin will not be able to revert to the inactive conformation, thus remaining constitutively active. Next, we compared the actin nucleation activity of the phosphomimetic mutants in comparison with WT gelsolin (Fig. 7). In the absence of profilin, gelsolin nucleates actin filament formation by binding to two actin monomers to form an actin filament nucleus (23Janmey P.A. Chaponnier C. Lind S.E. Zaner K.S. Stossel T.P. Yin H.L. Interactions of gelsolin and gelsolin-actin complexes with actin. Effects of calcium on actin nucleation, filament severing, and end blocking.Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3714-3723Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The actin filament nucleation properties of the WT and mutants were examined via a pyrene-actin polymerization assay at a gelsolin to actin ratio (1:40) in the presence of Ca2+ (0.1 mm). Ca2+ concentrations above 1 μm are required for gelsolin to bind to two actin monomers via its two halves G1–G3 and G4–G6 to form a stable actin nucleus (8Burtnick L.D. Koepf E.K. Grimes J. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. McLaughlin P.J. Robinson R.C. The crystal structure of plasma gelsolin: implications for actin severing, capping, and nucleation.Cell. 1997; 90: 661-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Although WT gelsolin eliminated the lag phase and increased the initial rate of polymerization, four of the five phosphomimetic mutants exhibited reductions in nucleation activity. Nucleation was most strongly attenuated in PM5 (S381D/S384D/S385D) followed by the PM1 (S381D/S385D), PM3 (S385D), and PM2 (S381D). PM4 (S384D) was indistinguishable from WT. These data suggest that the substitution of the phosphorylation sites by aspartic acid, which partially mimics phosphorylation, lowers the in vitro nucleation activity, possibly by inducing a change in the G3–G4 linker to a conformation that is suboptimal for forming a stable actin nucleus with G1–G3 and G4–G6. Previously, we demonstrated that YopO uses actin as bait to recruit and phosphorylate actin-filament-regulating proteins (16Lee W.L. Grimes J.M. Robinson R.C. Yersinia effector YopO uses actin as bait to phosphorylate proteins that regulate actin polymerization.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). YopO binds to subdomain 4 of actin, leaving the common binding pocket between subdomains 1 and 3 of actin available, a region of interaction for the majority of actin-binding proteins. A subset of actin filament-regulating proteins, those that are sufficiently elongated to span from the actin-binding site to the kinase catalytic cleft and can present suitable residues, are phosphorylated by YopO, including gelsolin, mDia1, VASP, EVL, and WASP (16Lee W.L. Grimes J.M. Robinson R.C. Yersinia effector YopO uses actin as bait to phosphorylate proteins that regulate actin polymerization.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Mechanisms of Yersinia YopO kinase substrate specificity. Mechanisms of Yersinia YopO kinase substrate specificity.Sci. Rep. 2017; 739998Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Here, we have mapped the YopO phosphorylation sites on the substrate gelsolin via proteomic analysis and have determined the effects of phosphorylation on the activities of gelsolin in actin filament dynamics. We identified Ser-385 as the major YopO phosphorylation site on gelsolin. YopO-phosphorylated gelsolin has actin-severing activity in the presence of EGTA. To validate the effect of phosphorylation at these sites, phosphomimetic mutants were created to mimic the phosphorylated state of gelsolin. Although WT gelsolin remains inactive in calcium-free conditions, the phosphomimetic mutants exhibit varying degrees of activity in depolymerization and severing actin filaments in both sedimentation and pyrene-actin assays. Mutants incorporating both S381D and S385D, PM5 (S381D/S384D/S385D), followed by PM1 (S381D/S385D), display the strongest activity in calcium-free conditions. However, single phosphomimetic mutants did not display any activity in EGTA conditions, probably due to the inability of substitution by aspartic acid to completely mimic phosphorylation. Nevertheless, phosphomimetic mutants PM1 (S381D/S385D), PM2 (S381D), PM3 (S385D), and PM5 (S381D/S384D/S385D) exhibit reduction in nucleation activity. Actin nucleation occurs through binding to two actin monomers in an appropriate orientation (26Hesterkamp T. Weeds A.G. Mannherz H.G. The actin monomers in the ternary gelsolin: 2 actin complex are in an antiparallel orientation.Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which in the case of gelsolin involves the linker between G3 and G4 wrapping around the filament (8Burtnick L.D. Koepf E.K. Grimes J. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. McLaughlin P.J. Robinson R.C. The crystal structure of plasma gelsolin: implications for actin severing, capping, and nucleation.Cell. 1997; 90: 661-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The reduction in nucleation by phosphorylated gelsolin may be due to the interference of the phosphorylated sites in adopting a conformation that is optimal for actin nucleation. However, inhibiting nucleation by gelsolin is unlikely to have a physiological role in vivo, because pointed-end elongation is not favored in the presence of profilin in vivo. The identification of phosphorylation sites within the linker region of gelsolin and its effects on gelsolin activity support a role for the linker in regulating the activity of gelsolin.

A total of 103 specimens of P. capensis collected from 12 localities and 217 specimens of P. peringueyi collected from 24 localities were sequenced for the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase one (CO1) locus. Results from analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA), pairwise ΦST comparisons and haplotype networks demonstrate weak to moderate genetic differentiation in P. capensis and P. peringueyi respectively. P. peringueyi exhibits partial isolation between populations associated with distinct biogeographic regions, likely driven by the region’s oceanography. However, there is minimal evidence for the occurrence of discrete regional evolutionary lineages. This demonstrated lack of genetic differentiation is consistent with a marine, highly dispersive planktonic phase in both the amphidromous P. capensis and the marine/estuarine P. peringueyi. Bayesian skyline plots, mismatch expansions and time since expansion indicate that both species maintained stable populations during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), unlike other southern African aquatic species."

Subjects subsequently conduct a series of binary dictator games in which they can distribute money between themselves and a charity that supports low-income people in developing countries. In each decision task, subjects choose between two different distributions, one of which is more generous towards the charity. In contrast to previous experiments that report a negative effect of undermining free will on honest behavior and self-reported willingness to help, we find an insignificant average treatment effect. However, we do find that our treatment reduces charitable giving among non-religious subjects, but not among religious subjects. This could be explained by our finding that religious subjects associate more strongly with social norms that prescribe helping the poor, and might therefore be less sensitive to the effect of reduced belief in free will. Taken together, these findings indicate that the effects of free will belief on prosocial behavior are more nuanced than previously suggested."

A number of clinical LQTS2-associated mutations have been reported in the first transmembrane segment (S1) of Kv11.1 channels, but the role of this region of the channel is largely unexplored. In part, this is due to problems defining the extent of the S1 helix, as a consequence of its low sequence homology with other Kv family members. Here, we used NMR spectroscopy and electrophysiological characterization to show that the S1 of Kv11.1 channels extends seven helical turns, from Pro-405 to Phe-431, and is flanked by unstructured loops. Functional analysis suggests that pre-S1 loop residues His-402 and Tyr-403 play an important role in regulating the kinetics and voltage dependence of channel activation and deactivation. Multiple residues within the S1 helix also play an important role in fine-tuning the voltage dependence of activation, regulating slow deactivation, and modulating C-type inactivation of Kv11.1 channels. Analyses of LQTS2-associated mutations in the pre-S1 loop or S1 helix of Kv11.1 channels demonstrate perturbations to both protein expression and most gating transitions.

https://openalex.org/W2594411294,"In heart failure (HF), a disturbed cardiac norepinephrine (NE) homeostasis is characterized by depleted cardiac NE stores, impairment of the cardiac NE re-uptake by the neuronal norepinephrine transporter (NET) and enhanced cardiac NE net release. Reduced cardiac NE content appears to be caused by enhanced cardiac NE net release from sympathetic neurons in HF, triggered by neurohumoral activation. However, it remains unclear whether reduced NE itself has an impact on cardiac NE re-uptake, independent of neurohumoral activation. Here, we evaluated whether depletion of cardiac NE stores alone can regulate cardiac NE re-uptake. Treatment of Wistar rats with reserpine (5 mg/kg/d) for one (1d) or five days (5d) resulted in markedly reduced cardiac NE content, comparable to NE stores in experimental HF due to pressure overload. In order to assess cardiac NE re-uptake, the specific cardiac [3H]-NE uptake via the NET in a Langendorff preparation was measured. Reserpine treatment led to decreased NE re-uptake at 1d and 5d compared to saline treatment. Expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme of the NE synthesis, was elevated in left stellate ganglia after reserpine. Mechanistically, measurement of NET mRNA expression in left stellate ganglia and myocardial NET density revealed a post-transcriptional downregulation of the NET by reserpine. In summary, present data demonstrate that depletion of cardiac NE stores alone is sufficient to impair cardiac NE re-uptake via downregulation of the NET, independent of systemic neurohumoral activation. Knowledge about the regulation of the cardiac NE homeostasis may offer novel therapeutic strategies in HF."

Highly similar cluster IIp RISA profiles were obtained from two patients harboring isolates of a same P. aeruginosa clone, suggesting convergent evolution in the structure of their microbiota. CF patients of cluster IIp had received significantly less antibiotics than patients of clusters Ip and IIIp but harbored the most resistant P. aeruginosa strains. Patients of cluster IIIp were older than those of Ip. The effects of P. aeruginosa on the RISA structures could not be fully dissociated from the above two confounding factors but several trends in these datasets support the conclusion of a strong incidence of P. aeruginosa on the genetic structure of CF lung microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W2593666988,"Emergency department (ED) crowding leads to prolonged emergency department length of stay (ED-LOS) and adverse patient outcomes. No uniform definition of ED crowding exists. Several scores have been developed to quantify ED crowding; the best known is the Emergency Department Work Index (EDWIN). Research on the EDWIN is often applied to limited settings and conducted over a short period of time.To explore whether the EDWIN as a measure can track occupancy at a Dutch ED over the course of one year and to identify fluctuations in ED occupancy per hour, day, and month. Secondary objective is to investigate the discriminatory value of the EDWIN in detecting crowding, as compared with the occupancy rate and prolonged ED-LOS.A retrospective cohort study of all ED visits during the period from September 2010 to August 2011 was performed in one hospital in the Netherlands. The EDWIN incorporates the number of patients per triage level, physicians, treatment beds and admitted patients to quantify ED crowding. The EDWIN was adjusted to emergency care in the Netherlands: modified EDWIN (mEDWIN). ED crowding was defined as the 75th percentile of mEDWIN per hour, which was ≥0.28.In total, 28,220 ED visits were included in the analysis. The median mEDWIN per hour was 0.15 (Interquartile range (IQR) 0.05-0.28); median mEDWIN per patient was 0.25 (IQR 0.15-0.39). The EDWIN was higher on Wednesday (0.16) than on other days (0.14-0.16, p<0.001), and a peak in both mEDWIN (0.30-0.33) and ED crowding (52.9-63.4%) was found between 13:00-18:00 h. A comparison of the mEDWIN with the occupancy rate revealed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.86 (95%CI 0.85-0.87). The AUC of mEDWIN compared with a prolonged ED-LOS (≥4 hours) was 0.50 (95%CI 0.40-0.60).The mEDWIN was applicable at a Dutch ED. The mEDWIN was able to identify fluctuations in ED occupancy. In addition, the mEDWIN had high discriminatory power for identification of a busy ED, when compared with the occupancy rate."

We found that the structure is stabilized by non-covalent interactions, with dominant contributions from hydrophobic residues at a and d heptad positions. Using NMR chemical-shift perturbation (CSP) analysis, we identified a subset of hydrophobic and charged residues of CC MBS (localized within and adjacent to the C-terminal region) contributing to the dimer-dimer interaction interface between homodimeric CC MBS and homodimeric LZ PKG-Iα. 15N backbone relaxation NMR revealed the dynamic features of the CC MBS interface residues identified by NMR CSP.

However, these results provide no atomic scale insight into the binding mechanism, due to the lack of 3D structural information for the subdomains of MBSCT180. We previously reported the structural characterization of the LZ PKG-Iα homodimer and identified critical residues of LZ PKG-Iα mediating its binding with CC MBS (14Sharma A.K. Zhou G.P. Kupferman J.

However, the absence of 3D structural information for CC MBS and lack of knowledge of the core residues involved in its binding to PKG-Iα have limited our structural understanding of the CC MBS·LZ PKG-Iα complex.

Using NMR chemical-shift perturbation (CSP)- and paramagnetic relaxation-enhancement (PRE)-driven intermolecular distances, we identify the critical hydrophobic and electrostatic residues of CC MBS constituting the dimer-dimer interaction interface of the CC MBS·LZ PKG-Iα complex. We apply 15N backbone relaxation NMR and molecular dynamics simulations to validate the CC MBS interface residues identified by NMR CSP and report a HADDOCK model of this heterotetrameric complex of two homodimers. The combined technical approaches deepen our understanding of the binding interaction between CC MBS and LZ PKG-Iα and set the stage for reevaluation of the interaction’s role in VSMC contractility and its regulation. The interaction between MBS/MYPT1 and PKG-Iα is currently modeled between the N-terminal LZ domain of PKG-Iα and the C-terminal MBSCT180 domain of MLCP (see schematic in supplemental Fig. S1). Although CC MBS binds LZ PKG-Iα, the structural basis of this interaction is not well-understood. Our results presented below describe the solution NMR structure of CC MBS and define at the molecular level the individual amino acid residues and dimer-dimer interface involved in the CC MBS·LZ PKG-Iα complex of VSMC. Overexpressed CC MBS polypeptide (aa 931–980) was predominantly soluble and was purified from soluble fractions (Fig. 1A). Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) shows that the purified CC MBS polypeptide adopts a dimeric conformation in solution (Fig. 1B; extrapolated dimer mass of 13,275 Da from the calibration curve agrees well with theoretical mass of 13,142.2 Da). 13C/15N- or 15N-labeled CC MBS polypeptides of >96% apparent purity migrated as a single homodimeric peak on SEC (Fig. 1B), consistent with previous results (16Sharma A.K. Sawhney P. Memisoglu G. Rigby A.C.

Fig. 1C shows the well-dispersed 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of 13C/15N labeled CC MBS, including the previously unassigned side-chain 1H-15N correlation cross-peaks for 2 Asn and 5 Gln residues. The excellent dispersion of observed cross-peaks within the 1HN chemical shift region 8.95–7.33 ppm confirmed the well-folded state of CC MBS polypeptide. Expression and purification of unlabeled and 15N-labeled LZ PKG-Iα followed protocols described previously (14Sharma A.K. Zhou G.P. Kupferman J. Surks H.K. Christensen E.N. Chou J.J. Mendelsohn M.E.

CD and 1D 1H NMR spectroscopy confirmed intact protein folding of LZ PKG-Iα (supplemental Fig. S2). Previously reported NMR assignments of CC MBS (17Sharma A.K. Rigby A.C. NMR assignment and secondary structure of coiled coil domain of C-terminal myosin binding subunit of myosin phosphatase.Protein Pept. Lett. 2014; 21: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) were confirmed in 3D 1H-15N NOESY-HSQC (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B) and in 3D 1H-13C NOESY-HSQC spectra. 831 intrachain NOEs were easily assigned in these highly resolved NOESY spectra. Sequential and medium range NOEs reveal (Fig. 2A) that aa Phe932–Ala967 constitute an α-helical coiled-coil region in CC MBS. An independent investigation of 15N relaxation rate ratios (T1/T2) validates identification of the coiled-coil region (supplemental Fig. S4A). Heteronuclear NOE values (supplemental Fig. S4B) suggest that this coiled-coil α-helical region is rigid in solution, whereas the remaining C-terminal loop region adopts a flexible conformation. Assignment of NOESY data revealed no inter-subunit NOEs for anti-parallel packing of two monomer units. High cross-peak symmetry prevented assignment of unambiguous NOEs for parallel packing. Isotope-filtered 3D and 2D NOESY experiments conducted with an isotopically mixed CC MBS sample allowed unambiguous assignment of 271 intersubunit NOEs, identifying a parallel packing mode of two monomer units in the CC MBS structure. (For this experiment, equimolar equivalents of 13C/15N-labeled and 12C/14N-labeled samples were denatured and then refolded, with confirmation of folding by CD spectroscopy (supplemental Fig. S3C; see also “Experimental procedures”). Fig. 2B shows strip plots for select residues eliciting numerous intersubunit NOEs in the isotope-filtered 3D NOESY experiments (see also supplemental Fig. S3D). These NOEs were easily verified in isotope-filtered 2D NOESY experiments. Fig. 2C summarizes intersubunit NOE contacts between heptad positions a and d′, a and g′, and d and e′ in the parallel homodimer of CC MBS. The NMR-derived experimental restraints consisted of 1933 unique distance restraints deduced from NOEs, 132 H-bond restraints, and 70 (φ,ψ)-backbone dihedral angle restraints (Table 1). Of 271 interchain NOEs assigned, 220 involved hydrophobic residues. Aromatic residues Phe932 and Tyr936 shared a total of 50 interchain NOEs. Predominant interchain contacts included almost equally distributed backbone-side chain and side chain-side chain interactions. No interchain NOEs were observed C-terminal to Gln969, reflecting the region’s flexibility.Table 1Structural statistics for ensemble of 20 refined structures of CC MBSParametersValuesNOE restraintsTotal1933Intraresidue (|i − j| = 0)678Sequential (|i − j| = 1)488Medium range (1 < |i − j| < 5)496Long range (|i − j| ≥ 5)0Intermonomer271Hydrogen bonds132Average distance restraints/residueaPer monomer subunit.24.0Dihedral angles (per monomer subunit)φ35ψ35Restraint violation (Å)Upper distance (>0.5)0Dihedral angle (>5°)0Average RMSD from mean coordinatesbValues for ordered structures (aa 931–967).

Open table in a new tab Fig. 3A shows an ensemble of the 20 best 3D structural conformers of the CC MBS parallel homodimer. These structures were selected based on lowest target functions, absence of upper distance NOE violations of >0.5 Å, and absence of dihedral angle violations of >5°, indicating good correlation between NMR experimental data and calculated structures. The mean structure is composed of two well-defined α-helices (Phe932–Ala967) packed in parallel. C-terminal aa residues Thr968–Phe974 constitute a flexible loop region. The CC dimer interface of the native 3D fold is packed and stabilized primarily by hydrophobic interactions. This tight packing is also reflected in a low RMSD value of all individual structures from the mean structure. The representative CC MBS ribbon structure shown in Fig. 3B highlights the hydrophobic and charged CC residue locations at heptad positions a and d and heptad positions e and g, respectively. In addition to several hydrophobic residues, heptad positions a and d also register polar residues. The hydrophobic phenyl ring protons of Tyr936 at heptad position a make several a-d′ and a-g′ interchain contacts. Although the presence of polar residue Asn943 at heptad a could partially destabilize its local environment, the residue’s several a-d′ interchain contacts probably foster parallel packing of monomers within the coiled-coil structure. Thr953 at heptad d also makes d-a′ interchain contacts, alongside similar contacts elicited by the classical hydrophobic residues contributing to core packing. The dimer interface near its N terminus is stabilized by several interchain contacts conferred by Phe932 at position d and by Tyr936 at position a. The aromatic rings of Phe932 and Phe932′ make a π-π stacking interaction, whereas, Tyr936 engages Phe932 and Leu935 at g and Ile939 at d through several interchain contacts. Additional hydrophobic interactions arising from residues located at a and d positions in heptad repeats 3–5 stabilize dimer interface packing in middle and C-terminal regions. Interestingly, no electrostatic interactions were observed despite the placement of two Lys residues at e and two Glu residues at g heptad positions. The electrostatic potential surface of CC MBS (Fig. 3C) reveals a near-C-terminal region occupied by several negatively charged residues and a near-N-terminal region of positive charge (overall pI, 5.72; net surface charge, −1). The positive electrostatic surface potential of the nearby LZ PKG-Iα C terminus (overall pI, 8.91; net surface charge, +2) is probably important in its binding to CC MBS. We applied molecular dynamics (MD) to examine the conformational stability of the homodimeric NMR structures of CC MBS and LZ PKG-Iα. Within the coiled-coil region, the narrow distributions of values of radius of gyration (Rg) for CC MBS (1.76 nm) and LZ PKG-Iα (1.62 nm) suggest overall stability with persistence of conformational fold throughout the simulation period (Fig. 4, A and B). Fig. 4, C and D, show the trajectory time-dependent Cα–Cα distance between the two chains of each homodimer (dC1-C2). In CC MBS and LZ PKG-Iα, the distributions of dC1-C2 values remain closer to their overall averages of 4.6 Å (Fig. 4C) and 5.7 Å (Fig. 4D), respectively, and remain stable throughout their trajectories. Fig. 4, E and F, show average RMSD evolution across the simulation trajectory for CC MBS (0.37 nm) and LZ PKG-Iα (0.26 nm). The similar initial RMSD values exhibit minor fluctuations at later simulation times. The initial RMSD for CC MBS oscillates within a narrow distribution, whereas the variation for LZ PKG-Iα is slightly larger throughout the simulation. These results demonstrate that tertiary conformations of the coiled-coil regions of these binding partners remain stable in solution during the simulation. We previously reported conformational perturbation of LZ PKG-Iα residues Leu22,"

Domestic sheep, goats and wild bighorn sheep are all susceptible to a multifactorial pneumonia. We sampled 43 herd goats from 7 herds and 48 pack goats from 11 herds for viral and bacterial serology, parasitology, and Pasteurellaceae microbiology. The goats in this study were in generally good health, although most goats did harbor various pathogens and parasites including several bacteria, specifically Pasteurellaceae, which have been associated with pneumonia in free-ranging bighorn sheep. It is not known if domestic goats can transmit the Pasteurellaceae or other pathogens found in this study readily to wild bighorn sheep. However, due the possibility of transmission, domestic goats in areas in or near bighorn sheep habitat should be managed to minimize the risk of spreading disease agents to bighorn sheep."
