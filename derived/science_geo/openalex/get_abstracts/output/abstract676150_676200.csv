https://openalex.org/W3174412391,"Foxp3+ T regulatory (Treg) cells promote immunological tumor tolerance, but how their immune-suppressive function is regulated in the tumor microenvironment (TME) remains unknown. Here, we used intravital microscopy to characterize the cellular interactions that provide tumor-infiltrating Treg cells with critical activation signals. We found that the polyclonal Treg cell repertoire is pre-enriched to recognize antigens presented by tumor-associated conventional dendritic cells (cDCs). Unstable cDC contacts sufficed to sustain Treg cell function, whereas T helper cells were activated during stable interactions. Contact instability resulted from CTLA-4-dependent downregulation of co-stimulatory B7-family proteins on cDCs, mediated by Treg cells themselves. CTLA-4-blockade triggered CD28-dependent Treg cell hyper-proliferation in the TME, and concomitant Treg cell inactivation was required to achieve tumor rejection. Therefore, Treg cells self-regulate through a CTLA-4- and CD28-dependent feedback loop that adjusts their population size to the amount of local co-stimulation. Its disruption through CTLA-4-blockade may off-set therapeutic benefits in cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W3177228822,"Aziridines-three-membered nitrogen-containing cyclic molecules-are important synthetic targets. Their substantial ring strain and resultant proclivity towards ring-opening reactions makes them versatile precursors of diverse amine products1-3, and, in some cases, the aziridine functional group itself imbues important biological (for example, anti-tumour) activity4-6. Transformation of ubiquitous alkenes into aziridines is an attractive synthetic strategy, but is typically accomplished using electrophilic nitrogen sources rather than widely available amine nucleophiles. Here we show that unactivated alkenes can be electrochemically transformed into a metastable, dicationic intermediate that undergoes aziridination with primary amines under basic conditions. This new approach expands the scope of readily accessible N-alkyl aziridine products relative to those obtained through existing state-of-the-art methods. A key strategic advantage of this approach is that oxidative alkene activation is decoupled from the aziridination step, enabling a wide range of commercially available but oxidatively sensitive7 amines to act as coupling partners for this strain-inducing transformation. More broadly, our work lays the foundations for a diverse array of difunctionalization reactions using this dication pool approach."
https://openalex.org/W3174871628,"We extend previous studies on the impact of masks on COVID-19 outcomes by investigating an unprecedented breadth and depth of health outcomes, geographical resolutions, types of mask mandates, early versus later waves and controlling for other government interventions, mobility testing rate and weather. We show that mask mandates are associated with a statistically significant decrease in new cases (-3.55 per 100K), deaths (-0.13 per 100K), and the proportion of hospital admissions (-2.38 percentage points) up to 40 days after the introduction of mask mandates both at the state and county level. These effects are large, corresponding to 14% of the highest recorded number of cases, 13% of deaths, and 7% of admission proportion. We also find that mask mandates are linked to a 23.4 percentage point increase in mask adherence in four diverse states. Given the recent lifting of mandates, we estimate that the ending of mask mandates in these states is associated with a decrease of -3.19 percentage points in mask adherence and 12 per 100K (13% of the highest recorded number) of daily new cases with no significant effect on hospitalizations and deaths. Lastly, using a large novel survey dataset of 847 thousand responses in 69 countries, we introduce the novel results that community mask adherence and community attitudes towards masks are associated with a reduction in COVID-19 cases and deaths. Our results have policy implications for reinforcing the need to maintain and encourage mask-wearing by the public, especially in light of some states starting to remove their mask mandates."
https://openalex.org/W3177458716,"APOE is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease. ApoE exacerbates tau-associated neurodegeneration by driving microglial activation. However, how apoE regulates microglial activation and whether targeting apoE is therapeutically beneficial in tauopathy is unclear. Here, we show that overexpressing an apoE metabolic receptor, LDLR (low-density lipoprotein receptor), in P301S tauopathy mice markedly reduces brain apoE and ameliorates tau pathology and neurodegeneration. LDLR overexpression (OX) in microglia cell-autonomously downregulates microglial Apoe expression and is associated with suppressed microglial activation as in apoE-deficient microglia. ApoE deficiency and LDLR OX strongly drive microglial immunometabolism toward enhanced catabolism over anabolism, whereas LDLR-overexpressing microglia also uniquely upregulate specific ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors upon activation. ApoE-deficient and LDLR-overexpressing mice harbor enlarged pools of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and show greater preservation of myelin integrity under neurodegenerative conditions. They also show less reactive astrocyte activation in the setting of tauopathy."
https://openalex.org/W3173668760,"A fraction of mature T cells can be activated by peripheral self-antigens, potentially eliciting host autoimmunity. We investigated homeostatic control of self-activated T cells within unperturbed tissue environments by combining high-resolution multiplexed and volumetric imaging with computational modeling. In lymph nodes, self-activated T cells produced interleukin (IL)-2, which enhanced local regulatory T cell (Treg) proliferation and inhibitory functionality. The resulting micro-domains reciprocally constrained inputs required for damaging effector responses, including CD28 co-stimulation and IL-2 signaling, constituting a negative feedback circuit. Due to these local constraints, self-activated T cells underwent transient clonal expansion, followed by rapid death (""pruning""). Computational simulations and experimental manipulations revealed the feedback machinery's quantitative limits: modest reductions in Treg micro-domain density or functionality produced non-linear breakdowns in control, enabling self-activated T cells to subvert pruning. This fine-tuned, paracrine feedback process not only enforces immune homeostasis but also establishes a sharp boundary between autoimmune and host-protective T cell responses."
https://openalex.org/W3176719069,"The unprecedented global COVID-19 pandemic has prompted a desperate international effort to accelerate the development of anti-viral candidates. For unknown reasons, COVID-19 infections are associated with adverse cardiovascular complications, implicating that vascular endothelial cells are essential in viral propagation. The etiological pathogen, SARS-CoV-2, has a higher reproductive number and infection rate than its predecessors, indicating it possesses novel characteristics that infers enhanced transmissibility. A unique K403R spike protein substitution encodes an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif, introducing a potential role for RGD-binding host integrins. Integrin αVβ3 is widely expressed across the host, particularly in the endothelium, which acts as the final barrier before microbial entry into the bloodstream. This mutagenesis creates an additional binding site, which may be sufficient to increase SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity. Here, we investigate how SARS-CoV-2 passes from the epithelium to endothelium, the effects of αVβ3 antagonist, Cilengitide, on viral adhesion, vasculature permeability and leakage, and also report on a simulated interaction between the viral and host protein in-silico ."
https://openalex.org/W3175225572,"Background and aim Public health measures used to mitigate the COVID-19 epidemic may have unintended, detrimental consequences particularly on older adults, whose voices and perspectives are often silent or silenced. The aim of this study was to explore the lived experiences of individuals aged 64 or older during the first COVID-19 lockdown. Methods We conducted a qualitative study in a convenience sample of 19 older adults (aged 64+) living at home in the Italian-speaking region of Switzerland during the first COVID-19 lockdown, between April and May 2020. Participants varied in terms of gender, education, age, nationality, and socio-economic status. We conducted semi-structured phone interviews to elicit emotions, expectations and hopes in relation to the present situation, and the post-pandemic world. We inquired about opinions on the enforced public health measures, including those specifically targeting older adults, and on the societal portrayal of older adults. Findings We found that the epidemic and the public health response to it had both generated a variety of resentments and a high degree of ambivalence at the individual, micro-, meso- and macro-social levels. We also found that labelling older adults as an at-risk sub-population inevitably contributed to public and self-stigmatization. Discussion We conducted an in-depth qualitative investigation of lived experiences of older adults during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in one of the most gravely hit region in Europe. Our findings on the complexity of unintended, detrimental consequences of outbreak responses on older adults have relevant implications for local adaptions of public health measures, and suggest that public health authorities should engage vulnerable sub-populations and promote bi-directional communication to inform and support communities."
https://openalex.org/W3175832841,"The gut microbiome may play a role in inflammation associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) development. This cross-sectional study examined its relation with glycemic status within a subset of the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) and estimated the association of circulating bacterial endotoxin (measured as plasma lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP)) with T2D, which may be mediated by C-reactive protein (CRP).In 2013-16, cohort members from five ethnic groups completed clinic visits, questionnaires, and stool and blood collections. Participants with self-reported T2D and/or taking medication were considered T2D cases. Those with fasting glucose >125 and 100-125 mg/dL were classified as undiagnosed (UT2D) and pre-diabetes (PT2D) cases, respectively. We characterized the gut microbiome through 16S rRNA gene sequencing and measured plasma LBP and CRP by standard assays. Linear regression was applied to estimate associations of the gut microbiome community structure and LBP with T2D status adjusting for relevant confounders.Among 1,702 participants (59.9-77.4 years), 735 (43%) were normoglycemic (NG), 506 (30%) PT2D, 154 (9%) UT2D, and 307 (18%) T2D. The Shannon diversity index decreased (ptrend = 0.05), while endotoxin, measured as LBP, increased (ptrend = 0.0003) from NG to T2D. Of 10 phyla, Actinobacteria (ptrend = 0.007), Firmicutes (ptrend = 0.003), and Synergistetes (ptrend = 0.02) were inversely associated and Lentisphaerae (ptrend = 0.01) was positively associated with T2D status. Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Lachnospira, and Peptostreptococcaceae were less, while Escherichia-Shigella and Lachnospiraceae were more abundant among T2D patients, but the associations with Actinobacteria, Clostridium sensu stricto 1, and Escherichia-Shigella may be due metformin use. PT2D/UT2D values were closer to NG than T2D. No indication was detected that CRP mediated the association of LBP with T2D.T2D but not PT2D/UT2D status was associated with lower abundance of SCFA-producing genera and a higher abundance of gram-negative endotoxin-producing bacteria suggesting that the gut microbiome may contribute to chronic systemic inflammation and T2D through bacterial translocation."
https://openalex.org/W3174323525,"Cyclin D1 is an essential regulator of the G1-S cell-cycle transition and is overexpressed in many cancers. Expression of cyclin D1 is under tight cellular regulation that is controlled by many signaling pathways. Here we report that PARP14, a member of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family, is a regulator of cyclin D1 expression. Depletion of PARP14 leads to decreased cyclin D1 protein levels. In cells with a functional retinoblastoma (RB) protein pathway, this results in G1 cell-cycle arrest and reduced proliferation. Mechanistically, we found that PARP14 controls cyclin D1 mRNA levels. Using luciferase assays, we show that PARP14 specifically regulates cyclin D1 3'UTR mRNA stability. Finally, we also provide evidence that G1 arrest in PARP14-depleted cells is dependent on an intact p53-p21 pathway. Our work uncovers a new role for PARP14 in promoting cell-cycle progression through both cyclin D1 and the p53 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3175112548,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the causative agent for causing the clinical syndrome of COVID -19. Accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection is not only important for management of infected individuals but also to break the chain of transmission. South Africa is the current epicenter of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Africa. To optimize the diagnostic algorithm for SARS-CoV-2 in the South African setting, the study aims to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assays. This study reported the performance of EUROIMMUN enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for semi-quantitative detection of IgA and IgG antibodies in serum and plasma samples targeting the recombinant S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as antigen. Samples were collected from 391 individuals who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 139 SARS CoV-2 negative controls. Samples were stratified by number of days’ post-PCR diagnosis and symptoms. The sensitivity of EUROIMMUN IgG was 64.1% (95% CI: 59.1–69.0%) and 74.3% (95% CI: 69.6–78.6%) for IgA and the specificity was lower for IgA [84.2% (95% CI: 77–89.2%)] than IgG [95.2% (95% CI: 90.8–98.4%)]. The EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA Assay sensitivity was higher for IgA but low for IgG and improved for both assays in symptomatic individuals and at later timepoints post PCR diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W3175256926,"The trimeric severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein (S) is the sole viral protein responsible for both viral binding to a host cell and the membrane fusion event needed for cell entry. In addition to facilitating fusion needed for viral entry, S can also drive cell-cell fusion, a pathogenic effect observed in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. While several studies have investigated S requirements involved in viral particle entry, examination of S stability and factors involved in S cell-cell fusion remain limited. A furin cleavage site at the border between the S1 and S2 subunits (S1/S2) has been identified, along with putative cathepsin L and transmembrane serine protease 2 cleavage sites within S2. We demonstrate that S must be processed at the S1/S2 border in order to mediate cell-cell fusion and that mutations at potential cleavage sites within the S2 subunit alter S processing at the S1/S2 border, thus preventing cell-cell fusion. We also identify residues within the internal fusion peptide and the cytoplasmic tail that modulate S-mediated cell-cell fusion. In addition, we examined S stability and protein cleavage kinetics in a variety of mammalian cell lines, including a bat cell line related to the likely reservoir species for SARS-CoV-2, and provide evidence that proteolytic processing alters the stability of the S trimer. This work therefore offers insight into S stability, proteolytic processing, and factors that mediate S cell-cell fusion, all of which help give a more comprehensive understanding of this high-profile therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W3177068247,"Retinal photoreceptors undergo daily renewal of their distal outer segments, a process indispensable for maintaining retinal health. Photoreceptor outer segment (POS) phagocytosis occurs as a daily peak, roughly about 1 hour after light onset. However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms which initiate this process are still unknown. Here we show that, under constant darkness, mice deficient for core circadian clock genes (Per1 and Per2) lack a daily peak in POS phagocytosis. By qPCR analysis, we found that core clock genes were rhythmic over 24 hours in both WT and Per1, Per2 double mutant whole retinas. More precise transcriptomics analysis of laser capture microdissected WT photoreceptors revealed no differentially expressed genes between time points preceding and during the peak of POS phagocytosis. In contrast, we found that microdissected WT retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) had a number of genes that were differentially expressed at the peak phagocytic time point compared to adjacent ones. We also found a number of differentially expressed genes in Per1, Per2 double mutant RPE compared to WT ones at the peak phagocytic time point. Finally, based on STRING analysis, we found a group of interacting genes that potentially drive POS phagocytosis in the RPE. This potential pathway consists of genes such as: Pacsin1, Syp, Camk2b, and Camk2d among others. Our findings indicate that Per1 and Per2 are necessary clock components for driving POS phagocytosis and suggest that this process is transcriptionally driven by the RPE."
https://openalex.org/W3175507277,"Access to safe, clean water and sanitation is globally recognized as essential for public health. Public toilets should be accessible to all members of a society, without social or physical barriers preventing usage. A public toilet facility's design and upkeep should offer privacy and safety, ensure cleanliness, provide required sanitation-related resources, and be gender equitable, including enabling comfortable and safe management of menstruation. Menstrual hygiene management (MHM) refers to the need to ensure that girls, women and all people who menstruate have access to clean menstrual products, privacy to change the materials as often as needed, soap and water for washing the body as required, and access to facilities to dispose of used materials. Challenges around menstruation faced by people experiencing homelessness, which tend to be greater than those facing the general population, include inadequate toilet and bathing facilities, affordability issues around menstrual products, and menstrual stigma. Public toilets are a vital resource for managing menstruation, particularly for vulnerable populations without reliable access to private, safe, and clean spaces and menstrual products. This mixed-methods study sought to: 1) understand the lived experiences of MHM among people experiencing homelessness in New York City with respect to public toilets; 2) describe general and MHM-related characteristics of public toilets in high need areas of Manhattan and analyze their interrelationships; and 3) examine the associations among neighborhood-level demographics and the public toilet characteristics in those areas. Qualitative methods included key informant interviews (n = 15) and in-depth interviews (n = 22) with people with experience living on the street or in shelters, which were analyzed using Malterud's 'systematic text condensation' for thematic cross-case analysis. Quantitative methods included audits and analyses of public toilet facilities (n = 25) using traditional statistics (e.g., Spearman's correlations) and spatial analyses (e.g., proximity buffers). Qualitative findings suggest cleanliness, access to restrooms, and availability of resources are critical issues for the participants or prospective users. Quantitative analyses revealed insufficiently provided, maintained, and resourced public toilets for managing menstruation in high-needs areas. Findings also suggest that toilets with more MHM-related resource availability, such as menstrual products and toilet stall disposal bins, were more difficult to access. Neighborhood-level characteristics showed a potential environmental injustice, as areas characterized by higher socioeconomic status are associated with more access to MHM-specific resources in public restrooms, as well as better overall quality."
https://openalex.org/W3175250943,"c-Myc is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in cellular homeostasis, and its deregulation is associated with highly aggressive and chemotherapy-resistant cancers. After binding with partner MAX, the c-Myc-MAX heterodimer regulates the expression of several genes, leading to an oncogenic phenotype. Although considered a crucial therapeutic target, no clinically approved c-Myc-targeted therapy has yet been discovered. Here, we report the discovery via computer-aided drug discovery of a small molecule, L755507, which functions as a c-Myc inhibitor to efficiently restrict the growth of diverse Myc-expressing cells with low micromolar IC50 values. L755507 successfully disrupts the c-Myc-MAX heterodimer, resulting in decreased expression of c-Myc target genes. Spectroscopic and computational experiments demonstrated that L755507 binds to the c-Myc peptide and thereby stabilizes the helix-loop-helix conformation of the c-Myc transcription factor. Taken together, this study suggests that L755507 effectively inhibits the c-Myc-MAX heterodimerization and may be used for further optimization to develop a c-Myc-targeted antineoplastic drug."
https://openalex.org/W3176435071,"Global survival studies have shown favorable development in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) treatment but few studies have considered extended periods or covered populations for which medical care is essentially free of charge. We analyzed RCC survival in Finland and Sweden over a 50-year period (1967–2016) using data from the NORDCAN database provided by the local cancer registries. While the health care systems are largely similar in the two countries, the economic resources have been stronger in Sweden. In addition to the standard 1- and 5-year relative survival rates, we calculated the difference between these as a measure of how well survival was maintained between years 1 and 5. Relative 1- year survival rates increased almost linearly in both countries and reached 90% in Sweden and 80% in Finland. Although 5-year survival also developed favorably the difference between 1- and 5-year survival rates did not improve in Sweden suggesting that the gains in 5-year survival were entirely due to gains in 1-year survival. In Finland there was a gain in survival between years 1 and 5, but the gain in 1-years survival was the main contributor to the favorable 5-year survival. Age group specific analysis showed large survival differences, particularly among women. Towards the end of the follow-up period the differences narrowed but the disadvantage of the old patients remained in 5-year survival. The limitations of the study were lack of information on performed treatment and clinical stage in the NORDCAN database. In conclusion, the available data suggest that earlier diagnosis and surgical treatment of RCC have been the main driver of the favorable change in survival during the past 50 years. The main challenges are to reduce the age-specific survival gaps, particularly among women, and push survival gains past year 1."
https://openalex.org/W3176578545,"Pediatric firearm-related injuries pose a significant public health problem in the United States, yet the associated financial burden has not been well described. This is the first study examining national data on the cost of initial hospitalization for pediatric firearm-related injuries. In this retrospective review, the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Kids' Inpatient Database from the years 2003, 2006, 2009, and 2012 was used to identify all patients 18 years of age and under who were admitted with firearm-related injuries. We compared demographic and discharge-level data including injury severity score, hospital length of stay, income quartile, injury intent, and inflation-adjusted hospital costs across age groups (0-5, 6-9, 10-15, 16-18 years). There were approximately 4,753 pediatric firearm-related admissions each year, with a median hospitalization cost of $12,984 per patient. Annual initial hospitalization costs for pediatric firearm injuries were approximately $109 million during the study period. Pediatric firearm-related injuries predominately occured among older teenagers (74%, 16-18 years), males (89%), black individuals (55%), and those from the lowest income quartile (53%). We found significant cost variation based on patient race, income quartile, injury severity score, intent, hospital length of stay, disposition, and hospital region. Inflation-adjusted hospitalization costs have increased significantly over the study period (p < 0.001). Pediatric firearm-related injuries are a large financial burden to the United States healthcare system. There are significant variations in cost based on predictable factors like hospital length of stay and injury severity score; however, there are also substantial discrepancies based on hospital region, patient race, and income quartile that require further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3175299692,"Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) are crucial mediators of electrochemical signal transduction in various organisms from bacteria to humans. Lipids play an important role in regulating pLGIC function, yet the structural bases for specific pLGIC-lipid interactions remain poorly understood. The bacterial channel ELIC recapitulates several properties of eukaryotic pLGICs, including activation by the neurotransmitter GABA and binding and modulation by lipids, offering a simplified model system for structure-function relationship studies. In this study, functional effects of noncanonical amino acid substitution of a potential lipid-interacting residue (W206) at the top of the M1-helix, combined with detergent interactions observed in recent X-ray structures, are consistent with this region being the location of a lipid-binding site on the outward face of the ELIC transmembrane domain. Coarse-grained and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations revealed preferential binding of lipids containing a positive charge, particularly involving interactions with residue W206, consistent with cation-π binding. Polar contacts from other regions of the protein, particularly M3 residue Q264, further support lipid binding via headgroup ester linkages. Aromatic residues were identified at analogous sites in a handful of eukaryotic family members, including the human GABAA receptor ε subunit, suggesting conservation of relevant interactions in other evolutionary branches. Further mutagenesis experiments indicated that mutations at this site in ε-containing GABAA receptors can change the apparent affinity of the agonist response to GABA, suggesting a potential role of this site in channel gating. In conclusion, this work details type-specific lipid interactions, which adds to our growing understanding of how lipids modulate pLGICs."
https://openalex.org/W3173248409,"How does a public health crisis like a global pandemic affect political opinions in fragile democratic contexts? Research in political science suggests several possible public reactions to crisis, from retrospective anti-incumbency to rally ‘round the flag effects to democratic erosion and authoritarianism. Which of these obtains depends on the nature of the crisis. We examine whether and how the onset of the global pandemic shifted public opinion toward the president, elections, and democracy in Haiti. We embedded two experiments in a phone survey administered to a nationally representative sample of Haitians in April-June 2020. We find that the early pandemic boosted presidential approval and intentions to vote for the incumbent president, consistent with a rally effect. These results show that a rally effect occurs even in the most unlikely of places–an unstable context in which the incumbent president is struggling to maintain order and support. At the same time, we find scant evidence that the onset of the pandemic eroded democratic attitudes, even in a context in which democracy rests on uncertain grounds."
https://openalex.org/W3174671319,"Chronic wounds are a major disease burden worldwide. The breach of the epithelial barrier facilitates transition of skin commensals to invasive facultative pathogens. Therefore, we investigated the potential effects of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) on dermal fibroblasts as key cells for tissue repair. In co-culture systems combining live or heat-killed SA with dermal fibroblasts derived from the BJ-5ta cell line, healthy individuals, and patients with systemic sclerosis, we assessed tissue repair including pro-inflammatory cytokines, matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), myofibroblast functions, and host defense responses. Only live SA induced the upregulation of IL-1β/-6/-8 and MMP1/3 as co-factors of tissue degradation. Additionally, the increased cell death reduced collagen production, proliferation, migration, and contractility, prerequisite mechanisms for wound closure. Intracellular SA triggered inflammatory and type I IFN responses via intracellular dsDNA sensor molecules and MyD88 and STING signaling pathways. In conclusion, live SA affected various key tissue repair functions of dermal fibroblasts from different sources to a similar extent. Thus, SA infection of dermal fibroblasts should be taken into account for future wound management strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3174356333,"Post-translational modifications to tubulin are important for many microtubule-based functions inside cells. It was recently shown that methylation of tubulin by the histone methyltransferase SETD2 occurs on mitotic spindle microtubules during cell division, with its absence resulting in mitotic defects. However, the catalytic mechanism of methyl addition to tubulin is unclear. We used a truncated version of human wild type SETD2 (tSETD2) containing the catalytic SET and C-terminal Set2-Rpb1-interacting (SRI) domains to investigate the biochemical mechanism of tubulin methylation. We found that recombinant tSETD2 had a higher activity toward tubulin dimers than polymerized microtubules. Using recombinant single-isotype tubulin, we demonstrated that methylation was restricted to lysine 40 of α-tubulin. We then introduced pathogenic mutations into tSETD2 to probe the recognition of histone and tubulin substrates. A mutation in the catalytic domain (R1625C) allowed tSETD2 to bind to tubulin but not methylate it, whereas a mutation in the SRI domain (R2510H) caused loss of both tubulin binding and methylation. Further investigation of the role of the SRI domain in substrate binding found that mutations within this region had differential effects on the ability of tSETD2 to bind to tubulin versus the binding partner RNA polymerase II for methylating histones in vivo, suggesting distinct mechanisms for tubulin and histone methylation by SETD2. Finally, we found that substrate recognition also requires the negatively charged C-terminal tail of α-tubulin. Together, this study provides a framework for understanding how SETD2 serves as a dual methyltransferase for both histone and tubulin methylation."
https://openalex.org/W3175125757,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a devastating condition with high morbidity and mortality rates. The pathological features of AKI are tubular injury, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and impaired vascular integrity. Pyruvate kinase is the final rate-limiting enzyme in the glycolysis pathway. We previously showed that pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) plays an important role in regulating the glycolytic reprogramming of fibroblasts in renal interstitial fibrosis. The present study aimed to determine the role of PKM2 in fibroblast activation during the pathogenesis of AKI. We found increased numbers of S100A4 positive cells expressing PKM2 in renal tissues from mice with AKI induced via folic acid or ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). The loss of PKM2 in fibroblasts impaired fibroblast proliferation and promoted tubular epithelial cell death including apoptosis, necroptosis, and ferroptosis. Mechanistically, fibroblasts produced less hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in response to a loss of PKM2. Moreover, in two AKI mouse models, fibroblast-specific deletion of PKM2 blocked HGF signal activation and aggravated AKI after it was induced in mice via ischemia or folic acid. Fibroblast proliferation mediated by PKM2 elicits pro-survival signals that repress tubular cell death and may help to prevent AKI progression. Fibroblast activation mediated by PKM2 in AKI suggests that targeting PKM2 expression could be a novel strategy for treating AKI."
https://openalex.org/W3175474994,"Tendon injuries are common and heal poorly, due in part to a lack of understanding of fundamental tendon cell biology. A major impediment to the study of tendon cells is the absence of robust, well-characterized in vitro models. Unlike other tissue systems, current tendon cell models do not account for how differences in isolation methodology may affect the activation state of tendon cells or the presence of various tendon cell subpopulations. The objective of this study was to characterize how common isolation methods affect the behavior, fate, and lineage composition of tendon cell cultures. Tendon cells isolated by explant exhibited reduced proliferative capacity, decreased expression of tendon marker genes, and increased expression of genes associated with fibroblast activation compared to digested cells. Consistently, explanted cells also displayed an increased propensity to differentiate to myofibroblasts compared to digested cells. Explanted cultures from multiple different tendons were substantially enriched for the presence of scleraxis-lineage (Scx-lin+) cells compared to digested cultures, while the overall percentage of S100a4-lineage (S100a4-lin+) cells was dependent on both isolation method and tendon of origin. Neither isolation methods preserved the ratios of Scx-lin+ or S100a4-lin+ to non-lineage cells seen in tendons in vivo. Combined, these data indicate that further refinement of in vitro cultures models is required in order to more accurately understand the effects of various stimuli on tendon cell behavior. Statement of clinical significance: The development of informed in vitro tendon cell models will facilitate enhanced screening of potential therapeutic candidates to improve tendon healing."

We developed an integrated modeling system to allow for spatially-explicit evaluation of potential impacts to bird populations following exposures to pesticides. Our novel methodology builds upon three existing models: the Terrestrial Investigation Model (TIM), the Markov Chain Nest Productivity Model (MCnest), and HexSim to simulate population dynamics. We parameterized the integrated modeling system using information required under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, together with species habitat and life history data available from the scientific literature as well as landcover data representing agricultural areas and species habitat. Our case study of the federally threatened California Gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica) illustrates how the integrated modeling system can estimate the population-scale consequences of pesticide applications. We simulated impacts from two insecticides applied to wheat: one causing mortality (survival stressor), and the other causing reproductive failure (reproductive stressor). We observed declines in simulated gnatcatcher abundance and changes in the species' distribution following applications of each pesticide; however, the impacts of the two pesticides were different. Our methodology attempts to strike a balance between biological realism and model complexity and should be applicable to a wide array of species, systems, and stressors."

We identified a highly specific recognition surface in the hydrophobic core of the CD86 transmembrane (TM) domain (TMD) that is required for recognition by MARCH1 and prominently features a proline at position 254. In contrast, MIR2 requires no specific sequences in the CD86 TMD but relies primarily on an aspartic acid at position 244 in the CD86 extracellular juxtamembrane region. Surprisingly, MIR2 recognized CD86 with a TMD composed entirely of valine, whereas many different single amino acid substitutions in the context of the native TM sequence conferred MIR2 resistance. These results show that the human and viral proteins evolved completely different recognition modes for the same substrate.

Cell-surface ligands play crucial roles in controlling adaptive immunity by modulating lymphocyte function both at initial activation and during downstream effector functions such as the clearance of infected or damaged cells. These crucial molecular cues are regulated in part by a family of membrane-associated RING-CH (MARCH) E3 ubiquitin ligases that mark cell-surface proteins for endocytosis and degradation by attaching ubiquitin to their cytoplasmic tails (1Lin H.

MARCH proteins thereby contribute to control of cell–cell contact, antigen presentation, and key accessory signals that are integral to T cell activation. The potent immune-modulating potential of MARCH proteins is underscored by the existence of virus-encoded homologs (11Coscoy L. Ganem D.

The best studied viral MARCHs are Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) proteins K3 and K5, also known as modulators of immune recognition (MIR)1 and MIR2, which downregulate MHC-I (MIR1/2), CD86 (MIR2 only), and ICAM-1 (MIR2 only) (11Coscoy L.

Most MARCH proteins share a common architecture consisting of an N-terminal cytoplasmic RING-CH domain, two transmembrane (TM) domains connected by a short extracellular loop, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of varying length (Fig. 1A). MARCH/MIR substrates are marked for downregulation through ubiquitin transfer to acceptor lysines in their cytoplasmic tails mediated by the cytoplasmic RING-CH domains of the MARCH proteins (6Ohmura-Hoshino M.

Only one study has reported dependence of substrate downregulation on a specific TM sequence (17Jahnke M. Trowsdale J. Kelly A.P. Structural requirements for recognition of major histocompatibility complex class II by membrane-associated RING-CH (MARCH) protein E3 ligases.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 28779-28789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), showing that human MARCH8 requires an aromatic-rich stretch of five amino acids at the cytosolic end of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRβ TMD for recognition of DRαβ heterodimers. Here, we examine the question of TM sequence specificity in MARCH/MIR-mediated downregulation of human CD86. Like MHC-I and ICAM-1, CD86 is ubiquitinated, internalized, and lysosomally degraded in dendritic cells by both human MARCH and viral MIR proteins (15Corcoran K. Jabbour M. Bhagwandin C. Deymier M.J. Theisen D.L. Lybarger L. Ubiquitin-mediated regulation of CD86 protein expression by the ubiquitin ligase membrane-associated RING-CH-1 (MARCH1).J. Biol.

These share little sequence homology, raising the question of whether they use common or distinct recognition sequences to achieve the same functional outcome. Human MARCH1 and KSHV MIR2 are both active against human CD86, yet they share only 18% amino acid identity globally and only 17% in the TM–loop–TM regions believed to encode substrate selectivity, suggesting that they may use distinct features to recognize CD86. We interrogated the requirements for MARCH1 and MIR2 downregulation of CD86 under identical experimental conditions using both CD86 proteins with engineered polyvaline TM domains (PolyVal TMDs) and a deep mutational scanning (DMS) analysis (21Fowler D.M. Fields S. Deep mutational scanning: A new style of protein science.Nat. Methods. 2014; 11: 801-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 22Rubin A.F. Gelman H. Lucas N. Bajjalieh S.M. Papenfuss A.T. Speed T.P. Fowler D.M. A statistical framework for analyzing deep mutational scanning data.Genome Biol. 2017; 18: 150Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) of CD86 mutants in which every possible single amino acid substitution was included for the entire single TM and short juxtamembrane (JM) domains. Our results show that MARCH1 very specifically requires a proline at position 254 in the CD86 TMD, whereas MIR2 requires an aspartic acid in the extracellular JM domain, as previously reported in a study using a chimeric model substrate (18Kajikawa M. Li P.C. Goto E. Miyashita N. Aoki-Kawasumi M. Mito-Yoshida M. Ikegaya M. Sugita Y. Ishido S. The intertransmembrane region of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus modulator of immune recognition 2 contributes to B7-2 downregulation.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 5288-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, MIR2 requires no specific sequences in the CD86 TMD, because it effectively downregulated CD86 with a PolyVal TMD, yet single amino acid substitutions at many TM positions could impair susceptibility to MIR2 but not MARCH1. These results demonstrate that mammalian and viral MARCH-family proteins have evolved completely different recognition modes for the same crucial immune-stimulatory molecule. Previous studies indicated that the recognition and downregulation of CD86 involved contributions from the TM and cytosolic domains for mouse MARCH1 (15Corcoran K. Jabbour M. Bhagwandin C. Deymier M.J. Theisen D.L. Lybarger L. Ubiquitin-mediated regulation of CD86 protein expression by the ubiquitin ligase membrane-associated RING-CH-1 (MARCH1).J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 37168-37180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) or the TM and extracellular JM regions for KSHV MIR2 (18Kajikawa M. Li P.C. Goto E. Miyashita N. Aoki-Kawasumi M. Mito-Yoshida M. Ikegaya M. Sugita Y. Ishido S. The intertransmembrane region of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus modulator of immune recognition 2 contributes to B7-2 downregulation.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 5288-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These studies used two different model chimeric substrates rather than full-length CD86, and the determinants of human MARCH1 specificity for human CD86 have never been systematically interrogated. We therefore tested dependence on the human CD86 TMD sequence for recognition by human MARCH1 and KSHV MIR2 in a quantitative cellular assay where they could be tested in parallel under identical experimental conditions (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1). We chose to assess MARCH1 and MIR2 functions in HeLa cells as they are naturally deficient in CD86 and amenable to retroviral transduction, allowing rapid generation of stable cell lines expressing WT CD86 and various mutants. Unmodified MARCH1 and MIR2 coding sequences were retrovirally introduced into HeLa cells under a tet-on element that provides doxycycline (DOX)-inducible expression (Fig. 1A). When these HeLa cells also stably express human CD86, DOX treatment causes removal of CD86 from the cell surface. This downregulation is measured using flow cytometry and converted into a susceptibility score that is proportional to the fraction of CD86 lost from the cell surface after MARCH induction (Fig. S1). Two HeLa cell lines were generated that stably expressed either WT human CD86 or a variant in which all 19 amino acids in the TMD (between W248 and W268) were simultaneously replaced with valine (PolyVal TMD) (Fig. 1, B and C). Both CD86 proteins were expressed at similarly high levels on the HeLa cell surface. These cells were then transduced with DOX-inducible MARCH1 or MIR2 and analyzed for CD86 susceptibility. Both MARCH1 and MIR2 exhibited strong activity against WT CD86. CD86 PolyVal TMD was no longer effectively downregulated by MARCH1, experiencing only a small (but reproducible) reduction in cell-surface level after DOX treatment, but it retained a level of susceptibility to MIR2 that was indistinguishable from that of the WT CD86 protein. The dependence of MARCH1 on specific sequence elements in the CD86 TMD is therefore near complete, whereas MIR2 requires no particular CD86 TM sequences at all, with the possible exception that one of the four valines in the WT sequence is crucial. These starkly contrasting results demonstrate that MARCH1 and MIR2 use distinct recognition modes to downregulate CD86. To interrogate the specific sequence requirements for recognition of the CD86 TMD, we devised a DMS approach that would yield the relative susceptibilities of all possible single amino acid substitutions in a 27-amino-acid stretch encompassing the 19 TM residues that had been replaced with valine in the aforementioned experiment, with an additional five extracellular and three intracellular JM positions to capture the effects of membrane-proximal mutations. A PCR-based strategy similar to one we previously reported (23Bridgford J.L. Lee S.M. Lee C.M.M. Guglielmelli P. Rumi E. Pietra D. Wilcox S. Chhabra Y. Rubin A.F. Cazzola M. Vannucchi A.M.

The combined variant library was retrovirally transduced into HeLa cells in triplicate and at low multiplicity of infection, with ZsGreen under an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) marking transduced cells. The resulting populations were sorted for ZsGreen expression (step A in Fig. 2). The ZsGreen+ cells (population I in Fig. 2) were expanded and further sorted for surface CD86 expression (step B). Total mRNA was prepared from samples of CD86+ cells (population II in Fig. 2) as well as total ZsGreen+ cells (population I), and the randomized region of CD86 was Illumina sequenced to measure variant frequencies before and after the CD86 sort. These are shown in diversity maps in Figure 3, A and B that represent variant counts as shades of purple in a matrix format for the entire sequence space covered in the screen. Each square represents the sum of counts for all synonymous codons encoding a given amino acid at that position. While most variants are well represented, some mutations show low counts both before and after selection and are therefore under-represented in the library. In particular, mutations to tryptophan and methionine can only be encoded by a single codon and are thus present at much lower frequencies than mutations to serine and arginine, which can both be encoded by six synonymous codons. Other examples are likely to be random variations arising during library preparation, such as P247E. Care should be taken when interpreting frequency changes in variants with low counts both before and after selection, as division by numbers approaching 0 can lead to large apparent differences. However, rather than cutoff data below a threshold number of counts, which can lead to meaningful changes being discarded when low frequency variants are enriched in subsequent steps, we have elected to display all data and assist the reader in evaluating sequence-function maps by including diversity maps calculated from an aggregation of the counts in all replicates before and after selection either in the main figure (Fig. 3) or in the supplement (Figs. 4 and 5) .Figure 3Selection of CD86 TM variants that reach the cell surface.

Variants are scored based on the log of the variant counts divided by WT counts. These log ratios for the input population are subtracted from the log ratios for the selected population. Because WT counts are used in the ratio to normalize all variants, other factors such as loss of diversity and uneven variant representation are controlled for. Variants that are enriched or depleted at the same rate as WT have a score of 0 (set to white in the color scale). A variant that is enriched 10-fold relative to WT counts will have a score of 1 (red). A 10-fold depletion relative to WT conversely results in a score of −1 (blue). The resulting sequence-function heat map shows the effects of all TM/JM mutations on surface CD86 expression in cells that do not express MARCH1 or MIR2 (Fig. 3C). This heat map reveals depletion of the types of variants one would expect when selecting for surface expression of a type I single-spanning membrane protein. For example, early termination mutants (far right column) are expected to be depleted because these remove or truncate the TMD, and most were strongly depleted (dark blue squares) compared with the WT sequence (white squares with gray dots) in population II. At some positions, early stop codons were only mildly depleted, for example, Asp244, His 245, Ala251, and Val256. These corresponded to variants that already had low starting frequencies (Fig. 3A) and therefore provide less reliable data. Also depleted were strong polar substitutions in the core hydrophobic region of the TMD (approximately A251–I266), since these substitutions carry large energetic penalties for residing in the nonpolar membrane interior"
https://openalex.org/W3175748521,"Alx1, a homeodomain-containing transcription factor, is a highly conserved regulator of skeletogenesis in echinoderms. In sea urchins, Alx1 plays a central role in the differentiation of embryonic primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs) and positively regulates the transcription of most biomineralization genes expressed by these cells. The alx1 gene arose via duplication and acquired a skeletogenic function distinct from its paralog (alx4) through the exonization of a 41-amino acid motif (the D2 domain). Alx1 and Alx4 contain glutamine-50 paired-type homeodomains, which interact preferentially with palindromic binding sites in vitro. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) studies have shown, however, that Alx1 binds both to palindromic and half sites in vivo. To address this apparent discrepancy and explore the function of the D2 domain, we used an endogenous cis-regulatory module associated with Sp-mtmmpb, a gene that encodes a PMC-specific metalloprotease, to analyze the DNA-binding properties of Alx1. We find that Alx1 forms dimeric complexes on TAAT-containing half sites by a mechanism distinct from the well-known mechanism of dimerization on palindromic sites. We used transgenic reporter assays to analyze the functional roles of half sites in vivo and demonstrate that two sites with partially redundant functions are essential for the PMC-specific activity of the Sp-mtmmpb cis-regulatory module. Finally, we show that the D2 domain influences the DNA-binding properties of Alx1 in vitro, suggesting that the exonization of this motif may have facilitated the acquisition of new transcriptional targets and consequently a novel developmental function."
https://openalex.org/W3176116645,"Mushrooms exhibit a high ability to accumulate potentially toxic elements. The legal regulations in force in the European Union countries do not define the maximum content of elements in dried wild-grown mushrooms. This study presents the content of mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As) determined in dried wild-grown mushrooms (Boletus edulis and Xerocomus badius) available for sale. Moreover, the health risk associated with their consumption is assessed. The inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (Cd, Pb, As) and atomic absorption spectrometry (Hg) were used. The mean Hg, Cd, Pb and As concentration in Boletus edulis was 3.039±1.092, 1.983±1.145, 1.156±1.049 and 0.897±0.469 mg/kg and in Xerocomus badius 0.102±0.020, 1.154±0.596, 0.928±1.810 and 0.278±0.108 mg/kg, respectively. The maximum value of the hazard index (HI) showed that the consumption of a standard portion of dried Boletus edulis may have negative consequences for health and corresponded to 76.2%, 34.1%, 33% and 4.3% of the maximum daily doses of Hg, Cd, Pb and As, respectively. The results indicate that the content of toxic elements in dried wild-grown mushrooms should be monitored. The issue constitutes a legal niche where unfavourable EU regulations may pose a threat to food safety and consumer health."
https://openalex.org/W3176513234,"Platinum sensitivity is an important prognostic factor in patients with ovarian cancer. Chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4) is a core member of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex, which functions as a chromatin remodeler. Emerging evidence indicates that CHD4 could be a potential therapeutic target for cancer therapy. The purpose of this study was to clarify the role of CHD4 in ovarian cancer and investigate its therapeutic potential focusing on platinum sensitivity. In an analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas ovarian cancer dataset, CHD4 gene amplification was associated with worse overall survival. CHD4 mRNA expression was significantly higher in platinum-resistant samples in a subsequent clinical sample analysis, suggesting that CHD4 overexpression conferred platinum resistance to ovarian cancer cells, resulting in poor patient survival. In concordance with these findings, CHD4 knockdown enhanced the induction of apoptosis mediated by cisplatin in ovarian cancer cells TOV21G and increased cisplatin sensitivity in multiple ovarian cancer cells derived from different subtypes. However, CHD4 knockdown did not affect the expression of RAD51 or p21, the known targets of CHD4 in other cancer types that can modulate platinum sensitivity. Knockdown and overexpression assays revealed that CHD4 positively regulated the expression of multi-drug transporter MDR1 and its coding protein p-glycoprotein. In addition, a first-in-class CHD4/SMARCA5 inhibitor ED2-AD101 showed synergistic interactions with cisplatin. Our findings suggest that CHD4 mediates platinum sensitivity by modulating MDR1 expression in ovarian cancer. Further, CHD4 suppression has a potential to be a novel therapeutic strategy in combination with platinum agents."
https://openalex.org/W3177265893,"A detailed understanding of the dynamics of small-scale (10s km) habitat use by the reef manta ray ( Mobula alfredi ) in the Maldives Archipelago is required to develop an effective national conservation management plan for this wide-ranging species. Here, a combination of photo-ID sightings data and acoustic telemetry were used to investigate both long-term M . alfredi visitation trends and small-scale movement patterns to key habitats on the eastern side of Baa Atoll (Hanifaru Bay feeding area, Dhigu Thila multifunctional site, and Nelivaru Thila cleaning station). All tagged and most of the sighted M . alfredi exhibited high affinity to the eastern side of Baa Atoll, where 99% of detections occurred, and 69% of individuals were re-sighted in multiple years. Sightings data suggests that visitation patterns may be associated with differences in habitat use by sex and maturity status. Boosted regression trees indicated that tag detection probability at Hanifaru Bay increased with increased westerly wind speed (&gt;5ms -1 ) during the day, close to a new and full moon just after high tide, and when the tidal range was low. Interaction effects between predictors suggest that wind-driven oceanographic processes, such as Langmuir Circulation, maybe working to increase zooplankton concentration at this location. Tag detection probability increased at Dhigu Thila under similar conditions. At Nelivaru Thila, it increased at lower wind speeds (&lt;5ms -1 ), close to a full moon, three hours after high tide. These results suggest that M . alfredi may utilise cleaning stations during the day when environmental conditions are not suitable for feeding. There was a high level of connectivity between these three locations, which suggests they form part of a network of key habitats that provide essential services to M . alfredi locally. Future conservation efforts should focus on identifying all areas of key habitat use for this species within the Maldives; applying strict protective measures to these sites and any connecting migration corridors which link them."

https://openalex.org/W3175557733,"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many governments to impose social distancing measures upon its citizens, including in the Netherlands. Motivating adolescents to adhere to measures such as social distancing can be challenging, since adolescents are relatively more affected by them, while experiencing virtually no personal health benefit. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic seems to impact the social environment of adolescents in schools, as some media sources have reported bullying and stigmatisation of students with an Asian appearance. This study aims to explore the experiences of adolescents regarding their Health-Protective Behaviour (HPB), as well as the prevalence and expression of stigma towards ethnic minorities within the context of the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. We performed a cross-sectional mixed-methods study, including two independent online questionnaires. An adapted version of the “HPB” questionnaire (n = 528) and the “Measure of Disease-Related Stigma (MDRS)” questionnaire (n = 380), were administered to Dutch adolescents of 10–16 years old, attending primary or secondary school. Furthermore, 15 interviews were held with eight male and seven female adolescents. All data collection took place between March 17 and April 20, 2020. Results show that adolescents perceive COVID-19 as a threat to other peoples’ health, rather than their own, and report adherence to public health measures in the interest of older and more vulnerable members of their community. We found no convincing evidence for widespread misinformation or stigmatising of certain ethnic groups among adolescents related to COVID-19 during this study. Participants acknowledged such behaviour happened in the early stages of the pandemic, before this study was initiated. Adolescents are a vital group for public health researchers to engage with during a pandemic, even when reaching them can be challenging."
https://openalex.org/W3176626590,"The aging process has an impact on mandibular bone morphology and can therefore affect shape sexual dimorphism. Understanding the effect of senescence on mandibular shape changes is particularly important to correctly estimate the sex of an individual and predict age-related conformational modifications. The purpose of this study was to assess age-related changes in mandibular shape and sexual dimorphism. The study sample comprised 160 Multi Slice Computed Tomography examinations of individuals aged 40 to 79 years. Geometric morphometric analysis of fourteen osteometric landmarks was used to examine sexual dimorphism and patterns of mandibular shape variation with age. Results showed that mandibular sexual dimorphism of shape remained significant with aging. Conformational changes occurred between 50 and 70 years and were different for male and female individuals. Females presented earlier and more marked age-related shape changes than males. These observations suggest that mandibular senescence is a sexually dimorphic process since its onset, rate, and the areas subjected to conformational changes differ from male to female individuals. Senescence-related changes present substantial variability, and further investigation is required to determine precisely the age that marks their onset."

Socio-demographic, lifestyle and sexual behavior data at enrollment were collected through a questionnaire.Overall, 39.3% of the men were seropositive for CT, 25.4% for HSV2, 1.3% for HCV, 97.3% for EBV, 14.0% for at least one of the seven oncogenic HPV (types: 16/18/31/33/45/52/58), and 17.4% for HPV 6/11. In the unadjusted models, age, race, smoking, sexual behavior variables, and seropositivity for high-risk HPV were significantly associated with the seropositivity for CT. In multivariable analyses, self-reported black race, higher numbers of lifetime female/male sexual partners, current smoking, and seropositivity to high-risk HPV were significantly associated with increased odds of CT seropositivity. Odds of HSV2 seroprevalence were elevated among older men and those seropositive for high risk HPV.Exposure to STIs is common among men. Prevention and screening programs should target high-risk groups to reduce the disease burden among men, and to interrupt the disease transmission to sexual partners."
https://openalex.org/W3177083924,"Over the last three decades, the accessibility and usage of mobile devices have increased among young children. This study's objective was to develop a validated caregiver-reported digital-screen exposure questionnaire (DSEQ) for children aged 2-5 years.DSEQ was developed in five phases. Phase 1, a draft questionnaire was developed by reviewing the literature on existing tools (n = 2) from 2009-2017. Phase 2, face-to-face interviews with primary caregivers (n = 30) were conducted in a tertiary-care-hospital for acculturation. Nine experts assessed the face and content validity of the draft Hindi and English questionnaire. Phase 3, a pilot study conducted among randomly selected families (n = 40) to evaluate the feasibility of DSEQ in field settings. Phase 4, test-retest reliability was done among 30 primary caregivers selected randomly in another urban cluster. Phase 5, the internal consistency of DSEQ was checked by conducting a cross-sectional study among randomly selected 400 primary caregivers in Chandigarh, North India. IBM SPSS Statistics for Macintosh, version 25.0, was for data management and analysis.A valid DSEQ with 86 items under five domains, including sociodemographic, screen-time exposure and home media environment, level of physical activity, media-related behaviors, and parental perceptions was developed. The pilot study showed that it was feasible to use the DSEQ in the field. DSEQ was reliable with kappa value ranging from 0.52 to 1.0, and intra-class coefficient of 0.62-0.99 (p<0.05). A strong internal consistency was observed for three domains including, screen-time exposure and home media environment (Cronbach's alpha of 0.82), media-related behaviors (Cronbach's alpha of 0.74) and physical activity (Cronbach's alpha 0.73).The developed DSEQ has good face and content validity and acceptable evidence of internal consistency and test-retest reliability. The DSEQ can be used for measuring digital screen exposure and its correlates among children aged 2 to 5 years."
https://openalex.org/W3174002686,"Socioeconomic inequality including wealth distribution is a barrier to implementation of health policies. Wealth distribution can be measured effectively using household data on durable assets. Compared to other methods of analysing Socio-economic Status (SES) using durable assets, Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) can create more reliable wealth quintiles. We therefore evaluated socioeconomic determinants of Schistosoma mansoni using MCA on household data among adult population in western Kenya. The hypothesis of this study was that MCA would be a useful predictor of S. mansoni prevalence and/or intensity.Twelve villages, 6 villages that had showed the greatest decrease in S. mansoni prevalence (Responder villages) and 6 villages that showed relatively lower decrease (Hotspot villages) between the year 2011 and 2015 were randomly selected for this study. This was according to a previous Schistosomiasis Consortium for Operational Research and Elimination (SCORE) report from western Kenya. From each village, convenience sampling was used to identify 50 adults from 50 households for inclusion in this study. An interview with a questionnaire based upon MCA indicators was conducted. One stool sample from each of the 600 adults was examined based on four slides for S. mansoni eggs using Kato Katz technique. Mean Eggs per gram(EPG) was calculated by taking the average of the readings from the four slides. A log binomial regression model was used to identify the influence of the various age-groups(<30 years, 30-60 years and >60 years), household size, wealth class, occupation, education status, main water supply, sex and sub-county of residence on S. mansoni infection. EPG was then compared across variables that were significant based on multivariate log binomial model analysis using a mixed model.Overall prevalence of S. mansoni was 41.3%. Significantly higher prevalence of S. mansoni were associated with males, those aged below 30 years, those who use unsafe water sources (unprotected wells, lakes and rivers), residents of Rachuonyo North, Hotspot villages and those earning livelihood from fishing. Only sex and household size were significant predictors in the multivariate model. Males were associated with significantly higher prevalence compared to the females (aPR = 1.37; 95% CI = 1.14-1.66). In addition, households with at least four persons had higher prevalence compared to those with less than four (aPR = 1.29; 95% CI = 1.03-1.61). However, there was no difference in prevalence between the wealth classes(broadly divided into poor and less poor categories). Intensity of infection (Mean EPG)was also significantly higher among males, younger age group, Rachuonyo North residents and Hotspot Villages.Socioeconomic status based on an MCA model was not a contributing factor to S. mansoni prevalence and/or intensity possibly because the study populations were not sufficiently dissimilar. The use of convenience sampling to identify participants could also have contributed to the lack of significant findings."
https://openalex.org/W3174272176,"To effectively address excessive SO42-, Cr(VI), total chromium and F- in the groundwater of acidic mining areas, a facultative anaerobic bacterium, Citrobacter, with sulfate-reducing properties, tolerance to hexavalent chromium and the ability to reduce Cr(VI) to Cr(III) was isolated and domesticated. Based on microbial immobilization technology, a nano-ZrO2 polyacrylamide hybrid material was prepared as an embedding agent to form nano-ZrO2 polyacrylamide Citrobacter (ZPC) particles. ZPC was microscopically characterized, and the removal performance and mechanism of ZPC for SO42-, Cr(VI), total chromium and F- in groundwater were analyzed. The results of single-factor tests showed that the optimal reaction conditions included a reaction temperature of 35°C, Citrobacter dosage of 35% (volume ratio) in the particles and hybrid material dosage of 300 mL; under these conditions, the removal rates of SO42-, Cr(VI), total chromium and F- were 70.5%, 100%, 100% and 93.3%, respectively, and the pH value increased from 4.6 to 8.07. On this basis, the effects of the reaction layer type, influent hydraulic load and influent concentration on the removal efficiency of polluted groundwater were studied through dynamic experiments. The experimental results showed that ZPC particles were better than Citrobacter as a reaction layer; the optimal influent hydraulic load was 3.0 m3/(m2·d); the selectivity of ZPC particles to anions and anionic groups was different; and the order of adsorption selectivity was F- > Cr(VI) > SO42-."
https://openalex.org/W3175946986,"Sounds like ""running water"" and ""buzzing bees"" are classes of sounds which are a collective result of many similar acoustic events and are known as ""sound textures"". A recent psychoacoustic study using sound textures has reported that natural sounding textures can be synthesized from white noise by imposing statistical features such as marginals and correlations computed from the outputs of cochlear models responding to the textures. The outputs being the envelopes of bandpass filter responses, the 'cochlear envelope'. This suggests that the perceptual qualities of many natural sounds derive directly from such statistical features, and raises the question of how these statistical features are distributed in the acoustic environment. To address this question, we collected a corpus of 200 sound textures from public online sources and analyzed the distributions of the textures' marginal statistics (mean, variance, skew, and kurtosis), cross-frequency correlations and modulation power statistics. A principal component analysis of these parameters revealed a great deal of redundancy in the texture parameters. For example, just two marginal principal components, which can be thought of as measuring the sparseness or burstiness of a texture, capture as much as 64% of the variance of the 128 dimensional marginal parameter space, while the first two principal components of cochlear correlations capture as much as 88% of the variance in the 496 correlation parameters. Knowledge of the statistical distributions documented here may help guide the choice of acoustic stimuli with high ecological validity in future research."

It has not been proved that CGMMV can be transmitted by an insect vector. In this study, the physical contact transmission of CGMMV by Myzus persicae in Nicotiana benthamiana plants was confirmed under laboratory conditions. The acquisition rate increased with time, and most aphids acquired CGMMV at 72 h of the acquisition access period (AAP). Besides, the acquired CGMMV was retained in the aphids for about 12 h, which was efficiently transmitted back to the healthy N. benthamiana plants. More importantly, further experiments suggested that the transmission was mediated by physical contact rather than the specific interaction between insect vector and plant virus. The results obtained in our study contribute to the development of new control strategies for CGMMV in the field."
https://openalex.org/W3176924520,"Overexpression and persistent activation of STAT5 play an important role in the development and progression of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common pediatric cancer. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated downregulation of STAT5 represents a promising therapeutic approach for ALL to overcome the limitations of current treatment modalities such as high relapse rates and poor prognosis. However, to effectively transport siRNA molecules to target cells, development of potent carriers is of utmost importance to surpass hurdles of delivery. In this study, we investigated the use of lipopolymers as non-viral delivery systems derived from low molecular weight polyethylenimines (PEI) substituted with lauric acid (Lau), linoleic acid (LA) and stearic acid (StA) to deliver siRNA molecules to ALL cell lines and primary samples. Among the lipid-substituted polymers explored, Lau- and LA-substituted PEI displayed excellent siRNA delivery to SUP-B15 and RS4;11 cells. STAT5A gene expression was downregulated (36-92%) in SUP-B15 and (32%) in RS4;11 cells using the polymeric delivery systems, which consequently reduced cell growth and inhibited the formation of colonies in ALL cells. With regard to ALL primary cells, siRNA-mediated STAT5A gene silencing was observed in four of eight patient cells using our leading polymeric delivery system, 1.2PEI-Lau8, accompanied by the significant reduction in colony formation in three of eight patients. In both BCR-ABL positive and negative groups, three of five patients demonstrated marked cell growth inhibition in both MTT and trypan blue exclusion assays using 1.2PEI-Lau8/siRNA complexes in comparison with their control siRNA groups. Three patient samples did not show any positive results with our delivery systems. Differential therapeutic responses to siRNA therapy observed in different patients could result from variable genetic profiles and patient-to-patient variability in delivery. This study supports the potential of siRNA therapy and the designed lipopolymers as a delivery system in ALL therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3177411132,"Wound healing is a multi-step process to rapidly restore the barrier function. This process is often impaired in diabetic patients resulting in chronic wounds and amputation. We previously found that paradoxical activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway via topical administration of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib accelerates wound healing by activating keratinocyte proliferation and reepithelialization pathways in healthy mice. Herein, we investigated whether this wound healing acceleration also occurs in impaired diabetic wounds and found that topical vemurafenib not only improves wound healing in a murine diabetic wound model but unexpectedly promotes hair follicle regeneration. Hair follicles expressing Sox-9 and K15 surrounded by CD34+ stroma were found in wounds of diabetic and non-diabetic mice, and their formation can be prevented by blocking downstream MEK signaling. Thus, topically applied BRAF inhibitors may accelerate wound healing, and promote the restoration of improved skin architecture in both normal and impaired wounds."
https://openalex.org/W3176409792,"Adenine nucleotides represent crucial immunomodulators in the extracellular environment. The ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73 are responsible for the sequential catabolism of ATP to adenosine via AMP, thus promoting an anti-inflammatory milieu induced by the “adenosine halo”. AMPD2 intracellularly mediates AMP deamination to IMP, thereby both enhancing the degradation of inflammatory ATP and reducing the formation of anti-inflammatory adenosine. Here, we show that this enzyme is expressed on the surface of human immune cells and its predominance may modify inflammatory states by altering the extracellular milieu. Surface AMPD2 (eAMPD2) expression on monocytes was verified by immunoblot, surface biotinylation, mass spectrometry, and immunofluorescence microscopy. Flow cytometry revealed enhanced monocytic eAMPD2 expression after TLR stimulation. PBMCs from patients with rheumatoid arthritis displayed significantly higher levels of eAMPD2 expression compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, the product of AMPD2—IMP—exerted anti-inflammatory effects, while the levels of extracellular adenosine were not impaired by an increased eAMPD2 expression. In summary, our study identifies eAMPD2 as a novel regulator of the extracellular ATP-adenosine balance adding to the immunomodulatory CD39-CD73 system."
https://openalex.org/W3177141883,"We evaluated the clinical utility of ultra-widefield imaging as an adjunctive tool for training resident ophthalmologists in the detection of retinal breaks. This was a prospective study conducted at a secondary health care center (Tri-Service General Hospital) in Taiwan. Participants were 44 patients (53 eyes) who were referred to our hospital after being diagnosed with retinal breaks. Patients first underwent an indirect ophthalmoscopy examination of the total fundus without scleral depression by our junior (first and second year) or senior (third and fourth year) resident ophthalmologist and then underwent an ultra-widefield imaging examination with a central image and four gaze-steered (up, down, nasal, and temporal) images to determine the number of retinal breaks in the total fundus and the four quadrants. Of the total 53 eyes, 31 were examined by junior residents and 22 were examined by senior residents. In the group of junior residents, ultra-widefield imaging was significantly better at detecting retinal breaks of the total fundus (49 vs. 33 retinal breaks, p < 0.001) and the temporal quadrant (17 vs. 10 retinal breaks, p = 0.018) than indirect ophthalmoscopy. In the group of senior residents, there was no significant difference in the ability to detect retinal breaks in the total fundus or each of the four quadrants with ultra-widefield imaging or indirect ophthalmoscopy. Our results indicate that, compared to indirect ophthalmoscopy, ultra-widefield imaging with a central image and four gaze-steered images has a better performance and is a useful adjunct tool for the detection of retinal breaks in junior resident training. Additionally, it could be a useful method for teaching indirect ophthalmoscopy examination to junior residents."

Such local modelling has not been completed for diet consumption in England despite diet being an important predictor of health status. The study sets out whether aspects of adult diet can be modelled from previously collected data to define and evaluate area-level interventions to address obesity and ill-health.Adults aged 16 years and over living in England. Consumption of fruit, vegetables, and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) are modelled using small-area estimation methods in English neighbourhoods (Middle Super Output Areas [MSOA]) to identify areas where reported portions are significantly different from recommended levels of consumption. The selected aspects of diet are modelled from respondents in the National Diet and Nutrition Survey using pooled data from 2008-2016.Estimates indicate that the average prevalence of adults consuming less than one portion of fruit, vegetables or 100% juice each day by MSOA is 6.9% (range of 4.3 to 14.7%, SE 0.06) and the average prevalence of drinking more than 330ml/day of SSB is 11.5% (range of 5.7 to 30.5%, SE 0.03). Credible intervals around the estimates are wider for SSB consumption. The results identify areas including regions in London, urban areas in the North of England and the South coast which may be prioritised for targeted interventions to support reduced consumption of SSB and/or an increase in portions of fruit and vegetables.These estimates provide valuable information at a finer spatial scale than is presently feasible, allowing for within-country and locality prioritisation of resources to improve diet. Local, targeted interventions to improve fruit and vegetable consumption such as subsidies or voucher schemes should be considered where consumption of these foods is predicted to be low."
https://openalex.org/W3173495465,"The chronic inflammation influences a microenvironment, where as a result of losing control over tissue homeostatic mechanisms, the carcinogenesis process may be induced. Inflammatory response cells can secrete a number of factors that support both initiation and progression of cancer and also they may consequently induct an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), the process responsible for development of distant metastasis. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) acts as a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is considered as a link between chronic inflammation and tumor development. MIF can function as a modulator of important cancer-related genes expression, as well as an activator of signaling pathways that promotes the development of prostate cancer. The study was performed on FFPE tissues resected from patients who underwent radical prostatectomy. To investigate the relationship of studied proteins with involvement in tumor progression and initiation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, we selected clinicopathological parameters related to tumor progression. Immunohistochemical analyses of MIF, SOX-4, β-catenin and E-cadherin were performed on TMA slides. We found a statistically significant correlation of overall β-catenin expression with the both lymph node metastasis (p<0.001) and presence of angioinvasion (p = 0.012). Membrane β-catenin expression was associated with distant metastasis (p = 0.021). In turn, nuclear MIF was correlated with lymph node metastasis (p = 0.003). The positive protein-protein correlations have been shown between the total β-catenin protein expression level with level of nuclear SOX-4 protein expression (r = 0.27; p<0.05) as well as negative correlation of β-catenin expression with level of nuclear MIF protein expression (r = -0.23; p<0.05). Our results seem promising and strongly highlight the potential role of MIF in development of nodal metastases as well as may confirm an involvement of β-catenin in disease spread in case of prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3175516787,"Reversing ecological degradation through restoration activities is a key societal challenge of the upcoming decade. However, lack of evidence on the effectiveness of restoration interventions leads to inconsistent, delayed, or poorly informed statements of success, hindering the wise allocation of resources, representing a missed opportunity to learn from previous experiences. This study contributes to a better understanding of spatial and temporal dynamics of ecosystem services at ecological restoration sites. We developed a method using Landsat satellite images combined with a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design, and applied this to an arid rural landscape, the Baviaanskloof in South Africa. Since 1990, various restoration projects have been implemented to halt and reverse degradation. We applied the BACI approach at pixel-level comparing the conditions of each intervened pixel (impact) with 20 similar control pixels. By evaluating the conditions before and after the restoration intervention, we assessed the effectiveness of long-term restoration interventions distinguishing their impact from environmental temporal changes. The BACI approach was implemented with Landsat images that cover a 30-year period at a spatial resolution of 30 meter. We evaluated the impact of three interventions (revegetation, livestock exclusion, and the combination of both) on three ecosystem services; forage provision, erosion prevention, and presence of iconic vegetation. We also evaluated whether terrain characteristics could partially explain the variation in impact of interventions. The resulting maps showed spatial patterns of positive and negative effects of interventions on ecosystem services. Intervention effectiveness differed across vegetation conditions, terrain aspect, and soil parent material. Our method allows for spatially explicit quantification of the long-term restoration impact on ecosystem service supply, and for the detailed visualization of impact across an area. This pixel-level analysis is specifically suited for heterogeneous landscapes, where restoration impact not only varies between but also within restoration sites."

We aimed to develop a dynamically accommodating intraocular lens powered by a membrane-shaped ion polymer metal composite actuator that is thin enough to be inserted in the eye. This study addresses two key problems identified in our previous accommodating intraocular lens prototype: the lack of repeatability due to the use of swine lenses instead of artificial lenses and the occurrence of a sixth order aberration. Thus, we present a new accommodating intraocular lens design and a method to transfer energy to actuators. To accommodate lens deformation and depth of focus, we used a membrane-shaped ion polymer metal composite actuator, thin enough to be inserted in the eye, and used an artificial silicone lens. To prevent the sixth order aberration, we included a ring between the ion polymer metal composite actuator and the lens. Different voltage patterns were applied to the IPMC actuator and changes in focus were observed. We were able to obtain repeatability and prevent the sixth order aberration. The dioptric power changed to ±0.23 D when ±1.5 V was used; however, at >1.5 V, a large accommodating range occurred, in addition to astigmatic vision. Thus, we have developed a novel prototype that is completely artificial, allowing reproducible and repeatable results. Visual accommodative demands were successfully met; however, although astigmatic vision was lessened, it was not completely eradicated."

Traditionally, forecasting has involved linear models such as AR and MR or nonlinear models such as ANNs using standardized numerical data such as corporate financial data and stock price data. Due to the difficulty of securing a sufficient variety of data, researchers have recently begun using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with stock price graph images only. However, we know little about which characteristics of stock charts affect the accuracy of predictions and to what extent. The purpose of this study is to analyze the effects of stock chart characteristics on stock price prediction via CNNs. To this end, we define the image characteristics of stock charts and identify significant differences in prediction performance for each characteristic. The results reveal that the accuracy of prediction is improved by utilizing solid lines, color, and a single image without axis marks. Based on these findings, we describe the implications of making predictions only with images, which are unstructured data, without using large amounts of standardized data. Finally, we identify issues for future research."

Our study focused on three Iowa towns that continue to experience an increase in under-represented minority populations and decline of majority populations as a proxy for studying shifting populations in an era of industrialized agriculture and global capital. We aimed to understand the socioecological impact of built environments-outdoor locations where people live and work-and likelihood of environmental exposures to impact vulnerable populations. Urban socioecological measures tend to present contradictory results in small towns due to their reliance on density and proximity. To compensate, we used post-occupancy evaluations (POE) to examine built environments for evidence of access to environmental design criteria to support healthy behaviors. The study systematically identified 44 locations on transects across three small towns to employ a 62 item POE and assess multiple environmental criteria to crosscut design with environmental health disparities. Principal-components factor analysis identified two distinct significant components for environmental risk and population vulnerability, supporting similar studies on parallel communities. Multilevel modeling found a divergence between supportive environmental design coupled with an increase environmental risk due to location. The combined effect likely contributes to environmental health disparities. The study provides a strategy for auditing small town built environments as well as insight into achieving equity."

Together with their co-regulators, they regulate development, homeostasis, and metabolism in a ligand-dependent manner. Their ability to respond to environmental stimuli rapidly makes them versatile cellular components. Their coordinated activities regulate essential pathways in normal physiology and in disease. Due to their complexity, the challenge remains in understanding their direct associations in cancer development. Basal-like breast cancer is an aggressive form of breast cancer that often lacks ER, PR and Her2. The absence of these receptors limits the treatment for patients to the non-selective cytotoxic and cytostatic drugs. To identify potential drug targets it is essential to identify the most important nuclear receptor association network motifs in Basal-like subtype progression. This research aimed to reveal the transcriptional network patterns, in the hope to capture the underlying molecular state driving Basal-like oncogenesis. In this work, we illustrate a multidisciplinary approach of integrating an unsupervised machine learning clustering method with network modelling to reveal unique transcriptional patterns (network motifs) underlying Basal-like breast cancer. The unsupervised clustering method provides a natural stratification of breast cancer patients, revealing the underlying heterogeneity in Basal-like. Identification of gene correlation networks (GCNs) from Basal-like patients in both the TCGA and METABRIC databases revealed three critical transcriptional regulatory constellations that are enriched in Basal-like. These represent critical NR components implicated in Basal-like breast cancer transcription. This approach is easily adaptable and applicable to reveal critical signalling relationships in other diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3176876173,"Background “Third agers” are people over retirement age in relatively good health; third agers make up an increasing percentage of the global population as the world’s longevity increases. Therefore, the challenge of prolonging a healthy third age and shortening the unhealthy period during the “fourth age” in the global health and social contexts is important in this process. However, no means to measure and support this has been developed as yet. We developed the Social Contact Self-Efficacy Scale for Third Agers (SET) and evaluated its reliability and validity. Methods We used a self-administered mail survey covering 2,600 randomly selected independent older adults living in Yokohama, Japan. The construct validity of the SET was determined using exploratory factor and confirmatory factor analyses. Its criterion-related validity was assessed using the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), the Japan Science and Technology Agency Index of Competence (JST-IC), and subjective health status. Results In total, 1,139 older adults provided responses. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses identified eight items within two factors: social space mobility and social support relationship. The final model had a Cronbach’s alpha 0.834, goodness-of-fit index 0.976, adjusted goodness-of-fit index 0.955, comparative fit index 0.982, and root mean square error of approximation 0.050. There was good correlation between scale scores and the GSES (r = 0.552, p &lt; 0.001), JST-IC (r = 0.495, p &lt; 0.001) and subjective health status (r = 0.361, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions The SET showed sufficient reliability and validity to assess self-efficacy in promoting social contact among third agers. This scale may help third agers in gaining and expanding opportunities for social contact, which can improve their physical health and quality of life and contribute to care prevention and healthy longevity."

Only 27.9% of university students in the department of science is women in 2019. In this study, we used an online survey to investigate whether randomly providing three types of gender equality information increased the motivation of junior high school students to choose STEM subjects and the motivation of their parents to support that choice. Information on STEM, especially about social equality, and information on math stereotypes and STEM occupations, increased students’ motivations for studying STEM. This suggests that providing gender equality information is an effective way to change students’ attitudes toward STEM."
