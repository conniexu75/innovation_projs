https://openalex.org/W2004033258,"Female hierarchies are stable over short periods but fluctuate from year to year. In general, young females rise in rank over older and often larger female relatives, even though old females remain active in troop defense. This previously undescribed dominance system can be plausibly explained with reference to inclusive fitness theory and the concept of reproductive value."
https://openalex.org/W1996848050,Computer simulation with plotter output reveals the close interrelation between ambient light and the skeletal morphogenesis of the massive Caribbean reef coral Montastrea annularis. This technique illustrates a new quantitative approach to evaluating ecological growth responses of colonial organisms.
https://openalex.org/W2003265310,"As cities increase in size, so do wage rates for the same work. There is evidence that the wage differential is persistent and stable over time, which suggests that the differential does not arise from a lack of adjustment that is in process of correction. Indeed, there is an inverse relation between size and growth rate. Large metropolitan areas with high wage rates have been losing population in recent years, which is hardly a sign that their higher wage rates are temporary inducements to workers to move into those cities. It is much more plausible that the differential is a more-orless permanent money payment that compensates urban residents for costs they bear as population size increases. This argument does not deny that there are nonwage benefits as well as costs of city size, that city size effects may vary between individuals and groups, or that there may be scope for improved policy on population distribution. Nonetheless, the benefits of size seem to be outweighed by the costs; all types and groups of people generally can and do move about until alternative locations are less attractive than their current location; and solutions to population distribution problems will often emerge as byproducts to the solutions of more basic problems."

https://openalex.org/W2071014152,"The discovery and investigation of X-ray continua has provided a new tool for studying the detailed electronic processes that occur when atoms collide. In the collisions considered here, the quasimolecular origin of the continuum radiation has been established. Therefore, as the atomic numbers of the projectiles and target atoms are increased one can simulate some of the properties of superheavy atoms. In particular, the peaked nature of the x-ray energy dependence of the anisotropy of K, L, and M MO radiation, as well as the peaked nature of the M MO spectra, will allow approximate spectroscopic studies of superheavy atoms. Special excitement attaches to the possibility of observing fundamental processes occurring under extremely high electric and magnetic fields. The recent successful development of a 1400-Mev U beam at the GSI (Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung) accelerator in Darmstadt, Germany, promises an imminent attack on these basic problems (63)."

While hydrographic observations were indicating El Niño activity off the South American coast, the current meters recorded an oscillation with a 25-day period, a wavelength of about 1000 kilometers, and an amplitude of 0.04 meter per second propagating westward at approximately 0.5 meter per second. These characteristics agree with theoretical models of a first-mode baroclinic Rossby wave trapped at the equator."
https://openalex.org/W1992209237,"A combined gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric technique was used to identify and quantitate the occurrence of myo-, chiro-, and scyllo-inositol in marine sediments. The most abundant isomer was myo-inositol. These inositols were found in all the organic-rich sediment samples examined, and the amount of inositol decreased steadily with the age of the sample. A small fraction of the inositols occurred as hexaphosphate esters."
https://openalex.org/W1992337466,The magnitudes of the mercury anomaly found in unequilibrated meteorites appear to fit a trend. The excesses in the ratios of mercury-202 to mercury-196 are related by simple multiplication factors. This periodicity may be interpreted in terms of the mode of production and ejection of the anomalous isotope from a stellar source.

https://openalex.org/W2007564413,"Liquefaction is probably the most difficult of the coal conversion techniques. In the true sense of the term, it is an unattained goal because the existing commercial processes for converting coal to liquid fuels require that the coal be gasified before the synthesis of a liquid product. Various economic and technological problems are discussed. (EJH)"

https://openalex.org/W2080379179,"Yearly seismic energy totals for many different regions of the earth show highs in 1965 and lows in 1967. Correlations found between totals for ridge systems and for the world are attributed to ambient stresses, which are close to those needed for failure in the lithosphere underlying those ridge systems. Energy highs for many different plate edges are thought to be the result of triggering by the large Alaskan earthquake of 1964. Other suggestions of triggering by major earthquakes are found in 1969 and 1971."
