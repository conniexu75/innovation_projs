Metabolites comprise the largest fraction of molecules in cells, but our knowledge of the metabolite-protein interactome lags behind our understanding of protein-protein or protein-DNA interactomes. Here, we present a chemoproteomic workflow for the systematic identification of metabolite-protein interactions directly in their native environment. The approach identified a network of known and novel interactions and binding sites in Escherichia coli, and we demonstrated the functional relevance of a number of newly identified interactions. Our data enabled identification of new enzyme-substrate relationships and cases of metabolite-induced remodeling of protein complexes. Our metabolite-protein interactome consists of 1,678 interactions and 7,345 putative binding sites. Our data reveal functional and structural principles of chemical communication, shed light on the prevalence and mechanisms of enzyme promiscuity, and enable extraction of quantitative parameters of metabolite binding on a proteome-wide scale."
https://openalex.org/W2781608882,"Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is an early-stage breast cancer that infrequently progresses to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Genomic evolution has been difficult to delineate during invasion due to intratumor heterogeneity and the low number of tumor cells in the ducts. To overcome these challenges, we developed Topographic Single Cell Sequencing (TSCS) to measure genomic copy number profiles of single tumor cells while preserving their spatial context in tissue sections. We applied TSCS to 1,293 single cells from 10 synchronous patients with both DCIS and IDC regions in addition to exome sequencing. Our data reveal a direct genomic lineage between in situ and invasive tumor subpopulations and further show that most mutations and copy number aberrations evolved within the ducts prior to invasion. These results support a multiclonal invasion model, in which one or more clones escape the ducts and migrate into the adjacent tissues to establish the invasive carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W2781483269,"The κ-opioid receptor (KOP) mediates the actions of opioids with hallucinogenic, dysphoric, and analgesic activities. The design of KOP analgesics devoid of hallucinatory and dysphoric effects has been hindered by an incomplete structural and mechanistic understanding of KOP agonist actions. Here, we provide a crystal structure of human KOP in complex with the potent epoxymorphinan opioid agonist MP1104 and an active-state-stabilizing nanobody. Comparisons between inactive- and active-state opioid receptor structures reveal substantial conformational changes in the binding pocket and intracellular and extracellular regions. Extensive structural analysis and experimental validation illuminate key residues that propagate larger-scale structural rearrangements and transducer binding that, collectively, elucidate the structural determinants of KOP pharmacology, function, and biased signaling. These molecular insights promise to accelerate the structure-guided design of safer and more effective κ-opioid receptor therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2781633877,"Clostridium difficile disease has recently increased to become a dominant nosocomial pathogen in North America and Europe, although little is known about what has driven this emergence. Here we show that two epidemic ribotypes (RT027 and RT078) have acquired unique mechanisms to metabolize low concentrations of the disaccharide trehalose. RT027 strains contain a single point mutation in the trehalose repressor that increases the sensitivity of this ribotype to trehalose by more than 500-fold. Furthermore, dietary trehalose increases the virulence of a RT027 strain in a mouse model of infection. RT078 strains acquired a cluster of four genes involved in trehalose metabolism, including a PTS permease that is both necessary and sufficient for growth on low concentrations of trehalose. We propose that the implementation of trehalose as a food additive into the human diet, shortly before the emergence of these two epidemic lineages, helped select for their emergence and contributed to hypervirulence."

The highly structured mammalian cerebral cortical wall is divided into laminae enriched for distinct cell types and functions during cortical neurogenesis (Bystron et al., 2008Bystron I. Blakemore C.

Decades of comparative cross-species studies reveal that cerebral cortical expansion in primates plays a major role in the evolution of human cognition (Krasnegor et al., 1997Krasnegor N.A. Lyon G.R.

Explaining human uniqueness: genome interactions with environment, behaviour and culture.Nat. Rev.

Gene expression programs in the developing human cortex are beginning to be defined (Kang et al., 2011Kang H.J. Kawasawa Y.I. Cheng F. Zhu Y. Xu X. Li M. Sousa A.M. Pletikos M. Meyer K.A.

Yet, compared with mouse, non-coding regions regulating gene expression in human corticogenesis are less well understood (Gray et al., 2017Gray L.T. Yao Z. Nguyen T.N. Kim T.K. Zeng H. Tasic B.

Blow M.J. et al.A high-resolution enhancer atlas of the developing telencephalon.Cell. 2013; 152: 895-908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Characterizing these regions is of great importance because most human-specific genetic variation and risk loci for neuropsychiatric diseases are found in these likely regulatory, non-coding regions (Ward and Kellis, 2012Ward L.D. Kellis M. Interpreting noncoding genetic variation in complex traits and human disease.Nat. Biotechnol. 2012; 30: 1095-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Enhancers and promoters are often found in open or accessible regions of chromatin where DNA-binding proteins like transcription factors (TFs) preferentially bind (Nord et al., 2015Nord A.S. Pattabiraman K. Visel A. Rubenstein J.L. Genomic perspectives of transcriptional regulation in forebrain development.Neuron. 2015; 85: 27-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Regions of accessible chromatin in bulk human fetal and adult brain have been identified using DNase-seq (Kundaje et al., 2015Kundaje A. Meuleman W. Ernst J. Bilenky M. Yen A. Heravi-Moussavi A. Kheradpour P. Zhang Z. Wang J. Ziller M.J. et al.Roadmap Epigenomics ConsortiumIntegrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes.Nature. 2015; 518: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (3578) Google Scholar), but not with a spatial resolution permitting identification of regulatory elements involved in human cortical neurogenesis. Chromatin regulators and TFs are key regulators of neuronal differentiation and function, further highlighting the need to define the cis-regulatory elements governing corticogenesis (Nord et al., 2015Nord A.S. Pattabiraman K. Visel A. Rubenstein J.L.

Wu W. Crabtree G.R. From neural development to cognition: unexpected roles for chromatin.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2013; 14: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Here, we perform assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq), a high-throughput method to profile accessible chromatin (Buenrostro et al., 2013Buenrostro J.D. Giresi P.G. Zaba L.C. Chang H.Y. Greenleaf W.J. Transposition of native chromatin for fast and sensitive epigenomic profiling of open chromatin, DNA-binding proteins and nucleosome position.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10: 1213-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (3189) Google Scholar), in the germinal zone and subplate/cortical plate in developing human brain, and by integrating these data with chromatin interaction measured via Hi-C, we identify distal regulatory elements (DREs) of key genes involved in cortical neurogenesis, including human-gained enhancers (HGEs). We show that target genes of HGEs regulate neural progenitor biology and are enriched in genes specifically expressed in outer radial glia (oRG), a cell population that is notably increased in humans and postulated to be critical for the cerebral cortical expansion in primates and other gyrencephalic species (Lui et al., 2011Lui J.H.

Biol. 2014; 30: 465-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Our data also suggest that gene regulation in neural progenitors and early-born neurons affects individual variation in adult cognitive function and risk for neuropsychiatric disease. This firmly connects prenatal cortical development to adult cognitive function and later-onset neuropsychiatric disease risk. To obtain a high resolution depiction of chromatin structure (ATAC-seq) and gene expression (RNA sequencing [RNA-seq]) in developing human fetal cortex, we dissected post-conception week (PCW) 15–17 human neocortex (STAR Methods) into two major anatomical divisions: (1) GZ: the neural progenitor-enriched region encompassing the ventricular zone (VZ), subventricular zone (SVZ), and intermediate zone (IZ), and (2) CP: the neuron-enriched region containing the subplate (SP), cortical plate (CP), and marginal zone (MZ) (Figure 1A; STAR Methods). Comparison of gene expression between dissected regions with a gold standard human cortex laminar transcriptomic atlas (Miller et al., 2014Miller J.A. Ding S.L. Sunkin S.M. Smith K.A. Ng L. Szafer A. Ebbert A. Riley Z.L. Royall J.J. Aiona K. et al.Transcriptional landscape of the prenatal human brain.Nature. 2014; 508: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar) revealed that differential gene expression (DE) between GZ and CP best matched the transitions between either the VZ or SVZ and CP in vivo with very high correlation (Figures S1A and S1B) (SVZ versus CP; r = 0.84; p < 2 × 10−16), validating the dissection and tissue isolation strategy. Following ATAC-seq QC measures (Figures S1C–S1G), we took a conservative approach to peak identification and quantification (Figures 1B and S1H–S1L; STAR Methods), finding high correlation between replicates and published DNase-seq from brain (Kundaje et al., 2015Kundaje A. Meuleman W. Ernst J. Bilenky M. Yen A. Heravi-Moussavi A. Kheradpour P. Zhang Z. Wang J.

Samples clustered first by tissue type (GZ/CP) and next by donor, similar to clustering by gene expression (Figures 1C and 1D), further demonstrating that the major differences in chromatin accessibility and gene expression are driven by tissue type and that replicates are highly concordant (Figures S2A, S2B, and S3A).Figure S1Tissue Dissection and ATAC-Seq Data Quality Measures, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Transition mapping (Stein et al., 2014Stein J.L. de la Torre-Ubieta L.

Correlations between samples not shown were not included for space limitations and were not substantially different than those displayed. To define functional regulatory elements related to neurogenesis, we identified 19,260 peaks with greater accessibility in GZ than CP (GZ > CP peaks; STAR Methods) and 17,803 peaks with greater accessibility in CP than GZ (CP > GZ peaks; Table S1). Differentially accessible (DA) peaks are significantly enriched in regions of the genome with known functionality including promoters (+/−1 kb from transcription start site [TSS]; 5′ UTR), and nominally depleted in regions with poorly annotated functionality (intergenic regions; STAR Methods) (Figures 1E and S3B). Near TSSs, DA peaks are also found at long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), microRNA (miRNA), and rRNA loci, in addition to protein-coding genes (Figures 1E and S3C; see Table S1 for complete list of proximal regulatory elements for non-coding RNAs [ncRNAs]). DA peaks are enriched in previously annotated chromatin states, including promoters and enhancers (Kundaje et al., 2015Kundaje A. Meuleman W. Ernst J. Bilenky M. Yen A. Heravi-Moussavi A. Kheradpour P. Zhang Z. Wang J. Ziller M.J. et al.Roadmap Epigenomics ConsortiumIntegrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes.Nature. 2015; 518: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (3578) Google Scholar), and in regions containing validated human forebrain enhancers (Visel et al., 2007Visel A. Minovitsky S. Dubchak I. Pennacchio L.A. VISTA Enhancer Browser--a database of tissue-specific human enhancers.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: D88-D92Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar) (Figure 1F), but depleted heterochromatin, quiescent, and actively transcribed regions of the genome (Figures 1F and S3D). Previous work predicts a significant relationship between chromatin accessibility and gene expression (Frank et al., 2015Frank C.L. Liu F. Wijayatunge R. Song L. Biegler M.T. Yang M.G. Vockley C.M. Safi A. Gersbach C.A. Crawford G.E. West A.E. Regulation of chromatin accessibility and Zic binding at enhancers in the developing cerebellum.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), although the correlations are often weak, because many additional factors, including TF binding, DNA methylation, histone tail modifications, and miRNA regulate steady-state transcript levels of a gene (Heintzman and Ren, 2007Heintzman N.D. Ren B. The gateway to transcription: identifying, characterizing and understanding promoters in the eukaryotic genome.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 386-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, Natarajan et al., 2012Natarajan A. Yardimci G.G. Sheffield N.C. Crawford G.E. Ohler U. Predicting cell-type-specific gene expression from regions of open chromatin.Genome Res. 2012; 22: 1711-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). To assess this relationship, we first visualized peaks of chromatin accessibility at genes known to be involved in neurogenesis. As expected, SOX2, a TF expressed in radial glia, has both higher chromatin accessibility at the promoter and expression in GZ, whereas HOMER1, a component of the post-synaptic density expressed in post-mitotic neurons, shows the converse pattern (Figure 2A). We observed a highly significant relationship between chromatin accessibility and gene expression across a set of marker genes known to be involved in neurodevelopment (Figure 2B), and across a less biased set of the top 240 DE genes between GZ and CP (Figure 2C; STAR Methods). Genome-wide, we found that accessibility at the TSS has a highly significant, but not perfect, correlation with expression at protein-coding genes (r = 0.417; p = 6.2 × 10−60) and lncRNA (r = 0.454; p = 0.0017) (Figure 1G; STAR Methods), consistent with prevailing models of transcriptional regulation (Heintzman and Ren, 2007Heintzman N.D. Ren B. The gateway to transcription: identifying, characterizing and understanding promoters in the eukaryotic genome.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 386-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, Natarajan et al., 2012Natarajan A. Yardimci G.G. Sheffield N.C. Crawford G.E. Ohler U. Predicting cell-type-specific gene expression from regions of open chromatin.Genome Res. 2012; 22: 1711-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We next assessed the biological pathways revealed by DA of chromatin at protein-coding TSS, observing an enrichment of gene ontology (GO) terms related to neurogenesis and early neuronal morphogenesis in GZ > CP peaks (Figure 2D). Conversely, enrichment of terms related to neuronal physiology and synapses were found in CP > GZ peaks. Similar GO enrichment was obtained in GZ > CP and CP > GZ DE genes (Figure S4A). KEGG pathway analysis of DA sites found enrichment in Notch and Wnt signaling pathways in GZ > CP sites, in contrast with neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and calcium signaling pathways found in CP > GZ sites (Figures S4A and S4B). These terms are consistent with both the expected cellular composition in regions containing neural progenitors versus neurons, as well as the correlation between chromatin accessibility and gene expression. We next sought to define DREs involved in neurogenesis for each gene. Although regulatory elements are often assumed to regulate the closest gene, this is an overly simplifying assumption (Amano et al., 2009Amano T. Sagai T. Tanabe H. Mizushina Y. Nakazawa H. Shiroishi T. Chromosomal dynamics at the Shh locus: limb bud-specific differential regulation of competence and active transcription.Dev. Cell. 2009; 16: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Therefore, we created a mapping between chromatin accessibility peaks and their cognate genes (Figure 3A; STAR Methods), which is predicted to represent functional enhancer-promoter interactions that regulate gene expression during corticogenesis. To avoid spurious correlations, we also required evidence of a physical interaction between the two correlated regions, as measured by chromatin capture via Hi-C from matching stages and tissue type (Won et al., 2016Won H. de la Torre-Ubieta L. Stein J.L. Parikshak N.N. Huang J. Opland C.K. Gandal M.J. Sutton G.J. Hormozdiari F. Lu D. et al.Chromosome conformation elucidates regulatory relationships in developing human brain.Nature. 2016; 538: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Consistently, the inter-peak correlation was significantly higher between ATAC-seq peak pairs with evidence of interaction by Hi-C than in those not supported by Hi-C (p = 1.1 × 10−100 for GZ > CP peaks with Hi-C data from GZ tissue; p = 3.22 × 10−34 for CP > GZ peaks with Hi-C data from CP tissue) (Figure"
https://openalex.org/W2782249154,"Mesolimbic dopamine (DA) neurons play a central role in motivation and reward processing. Although the activity of these mesolimbic DA neurons is controlled by afferent inputs, little is known about the circuits in which they are embedded. Using retrograde tracing, electrophysiology, optogenetics, and behavioral assays, we identify principles of afferent-specific control in the mesolimbic DA system. Neurons in the medial shell subdivision of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) exert direct inhibitory control over two separate populations of mesolimbic DA neurons by activating different GABA receptor subtypes. In contrast, NAc lateral shell neurons mainly synapse onto ventral tegmental area (VTA) GABA neurons, resulting in disinhibition of DA neurons that project back to the NAc lateral shell. Lastly, we establish a critical role for NAc subregion-specific input to the VTA underlying motivated behavior. Collectively, our results suggest a distinction in the incorporation of inhibitory inputs between different subtypes of mesolimbic DA neurons."

Insufficient INS leads to diabetes mellitus, a metabolic disease that affects over 300 million people worldwide (Ackermann and Gannon, 2007Ackermann A.M. Gannon M.

The fundamental objective of diabetes treatment is to preserve and restore a functional beta cell mass, perhaps through beta cell replacement therapy. However, beta cell replacement may fall short in autoimmune type 1 diabetes (T1D) due to persistent, recurrent autoimmunity against the new beta cells (Ackermann and Gannon, 2007Ackermann A.M.

In fact, this form of renewed autoimmune attack has been found to be particularly aggressive (Purcell and Mottram, 1995Purcell L.J. Mottram P.L. Prevention of both rejection and recurrence of autoimmune disease in the NOD/Lt mouse following segmental pancreas transplantation.Transplant. Proc. 1995; 27: 2166-2167PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, a clinically applicable strategy leading to a more durable beta cell mass has yet to be developed for T1D (Campbell et al., 2007Campbell P.M. Salam A. Ryan E.A. Senior P. Paty B.W.

Although great efforts have been made to identify, isolate, and purify beta cell progenitors in the adult pancreas (Kopp et al., 2011aKopp J.L. Dubois C.L. Hao E. Thorel F. Herrera P.L. Sander M.

Thus, gene therapy may be required in order to generate new beta cells from other cell types (Lee et al., 2013Lee J. Sugiyama T. Liu Y. Wang J. Gu X. Lei J. Markmann J.F. Miyazaki S. Miyazaki J.

In vivo reprogramming of adult pancreatic exocrine cells to beta-cells.Nature. 2008; 455: 627-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). Pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (Pdx1) is a transcription factor necessary for pancreatic development, including beta cell maturation, beta cell proliferation, and function (Gannon et al., 2001Gannon M. Gamer L.W. Wright C.V. Regulatory regions driving developmental and tissue-specific expression of the essential pancreatic gene pdx1.Dev. Biol. 2001; 238: 185-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). MafA is a transcription factor that binds to the INS promoter to regulate INS expression and beta cell metabolism (Hang and Stein, 2011Hang Y. Stein R. MafA and MafB activity in pancreatic β cells.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2011; 22: 364-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of a combination of three key pancreatic beta cell transcription factors (Pdx1, neurogenin 3 [Ngn3], and MafA) has been shown to reprogram adult mouse pancreatic acinar cells into beta cell-like cells (Akinci et al., 2012Akinci E. Banga A. Greder L.V. Dutton J.R. Slack J.M. Reprogramming of pancreatic exocrine cells towards a beta (β) cell character using Pdx1, Ngn3 and MafA.Biochem.

Moreover, co-overexpression of these three genes has been shown to convert Sox9+ liver cells into INS-producing cells (Banga et al., 2012Banga A. Akinci E. Greder L.V. Dutton J.R. Slack J.M. In vivo reprogramming of Sox9+ cells in the liver to insulin-secreting ducts.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 15336-15341Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, alpha cells may be the ideal source for beta cell replacement for several reasons. First, as endocrine cells, alpha cells are developmentally similar to beta cells, which may facilitate reprogramming (Bramswig and Kaestner, 2011Bramswig N.C. Kaestner K.H. Transcriptional regulation of α-cell differentiation.Diabetes Obes. Metab. 2011; 13: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, Herrera, 2000Herrera P.L. Adult insulin- and glucagon-producing cells differentiate from two independent cell lineages.Development. 2000; 127: 2317-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, alpha cells are already situated within the islet (Bramswig and Kaestner, 2011Bramswig N.C. Kaestner K.H. Transcriptional regulation of α-cell differentiation.Diabetes Obes. Metab. 2011; 13: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, Herrera, 2000Herrera P.L. Adult insulin- and glucagon-producing cells differentiate from two independent cell lineages.Development. 2000; 127: 2317-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Pipeleers et al., 2002Pipeleers D. Keymeulen B. Chatenoud L. Hendrieckx C. Ling Z. Mathieu C. Roep B. Ysebaert D. A view on beta cell transplantation in diabetes.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2002; 958: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) so that a reprogrammed beta cell from an alpha cell would be well positioned for ideal beta cell function. Third, alpha cell hyperplasia is commonly seen in diabetic animals and patients and constitutes a potentially abundant source for reprogramming, and human islets in particular have a large percentage of alpha cells (Zaret and White, 2010Zaret K.S. White M.F. Diabetes forum: Extreme makeover of pancreatic alpha-cells.Nature. 2010; 464: 1132-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Fourth, according to recent reports, a significant decrease in the number of alpha cells did not appear to harm proper glucose metabolism (Shiota et al., 2013Shiota C. Prasadan K. Guo P. El-Gohary Y. Wiersch J. Xiao X. Esni F. Gittes G.K. α-Cells are dispensable in postnatal morphogenesis and maturation of mouse pancreatic islets.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2013; 305: E1030-E1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, Thorel et al., 2011Thorel F. Damond N. Chera S. Wiederkehr A. Thorens B. Meda P. Wollheim C.B. Herrera P.L. Normal glucagon signaling and β-cell function after near-total α-cell ablation in adult mice.Diabetes. 2011; 60: 2872-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Fifth, glucagon (GCG) signaling appears to be detrimental in diabetes, which suggests that a partial reduction in alpha cell mass due to their conversion to beta cells may be beneficial to blood glucose control (Ackermann and Gannon, 2007Ackermann A.M. Gannon M. Molecular regulation of pancreatic beta-cell mass development, maintenance, and expansion.J. Mol.

Generation and regeneration of cells of the liver and pancreas.Science. 2008; 322: 1490-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Sixth, alpha-to-beta cell conversion is feasible since it has been reported to occur after an extreme beta cell loss (Thorel et al., 2010Thorel F. Népote V. Avril I. Kohno K. Desgraz R. Chera S. Herrera P.L. Conversion of adult pancreatic alpha-cells to beta-cells after extreme beta-cell loss.Nature. 2010; 464: 1149-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar) and in an insulinoma model with alpha cell-specific Men1 ablation (Lu et al., 2010Lu J. Herrera P.L. Carreira C. Bonnavion R. Seigne C. Calender A. Bertolino P. Zhang C.X. Alpha cell-specific Men1 ablation triggers the transdifferentiation of glucagon-expressing cells and insulinoma development.Gastroenterology. 2010; 138: 1954-1965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Last, a recent ATAC sequencing (ATAC-seq) study showed that the alpha cell genome is remarkably accessible and thus likely to more easily undergo transdifferentiation (Ackermann et al., 2016Ackermann A.M. Wang Z. Schug J. Naji A. Kaestner K.H. Integration of ATAC-seq and RNA-seq identifies human alpha cell and beta cell signature genes.Mol. Metab. 2016; 5: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Based on these concepts, we were prompted to examine whether forced expression of key beta cell transcription factors in alpha cells may trigger their reprogramming to generate beta or beta-like cells. We expected that Ngn3 would not be necessary to convert alpha cells to beta cells because Ngn3 is necessary for the formation of endocrine cells, but alpha cells are already endocrine cells. Non-integrative adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors can impart long-term expression of transgenes up to 4.5 kb in length. Moreover, AAV vectors have been found to be more efficient than adenoviral and lentiviral vectors in transducing pancreatic cells (Guo et al., 2012aGuo P. El-Gohary Y. Prasadan K. Shiota C. Xiao X.

We saw glucose normalization in beta cell-toxin-treated mice, and the new INS+ cells were found to derive almost exclusively from alpha cells. We then similarly delivered virus to autoimmune, hyperglycemic non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, and saw durable euglycemia, typically for 4 months. The mechanisms underlying the prolonged survival of new INS+ cells in the autoimmune environment were further investigated. Here, we examined the potential reprogramming of alpha cells into beta cells by inducing the expression of Pdx1 and MafA (PM) using AAV (AAV-PM) in mice. We first administered a single dose of either alloxan (ALX) or streptotozocin (STZ) to induce a sustained hyperglycemia in C57BL/6 mice (Figure S1A) (Xiao et al., 2013aXiao X. Chen Z. Shiota C. Prasadan K. Guo P. El-Gohary Y. Paredes J. Welsh C. Wiersch J. Gittes G.K. No evidence for β cell neogenesis in murine adult pancreas.J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123: 2207-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) due to a significant decrease in beta cell mass (Figures S1B–S1E, ALX: decreased to 3.8% ± 0.2%, STZ: decreased to 6.5% ± 0.9%). Moreover, both ALX and STZ induced a modest but significant increase in alpha cell mass (Figures S1B–S1E), similar to that seen in some diabetic patients (Zaret and White, 2010Zaret K.S. White M.F. Diabetes forum: Extreme makeover of pancreatic alpha-cells.Nature. 2010; 464: 1132-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). No significant increase in INS+ cell proliferation was detected after ALX treatment (Figures S1F and S1G). We thus chose to use ALX in further studies to examine alpha-to-beta cell conversion in vivo, due to the higher and more consistent degree of beta cell ablation at the dosages used. To allow lineage tracing of alpha cells, we first generated GCG-Cre; R26RTomato reporter mice (Herrera, 2000Herrera P.L.

Quantification showed that the baseline labeling of alpha cells in GCG-Cre; R26RTomato mice was 71.5% ± 5.5%, with absence of detectable off-target labeling (Figure S2A). Thus, we then gave ALX to destroy the majority of beta cells in these GCG-Cre; R26RTomato mice. One week later, AAV-PM or control AAV-GFP was directly introduced into the mouse pancreas, using a recently developed pancreatic intraductal viral infusion technique, in which infusion of 150 μL of AAV serotype 8 efficiently transduces endocrine cells (Xiao et al., 2014aXiao X.

The intrapancreatic ductal delivery of virus did not result in appreciable expression of GFP in the liver. More importantly, no significant levels of INS gene expression were detected in the liver (Figures S3A and S3B). As a quality control, we stained for Pdx1 and MafA in untreated mice (no ALX, no virus), ALX/AAV-GFP-treated mice, and ALX/AAV-PM-treated mice to confirm the expression of these transgenes in the transduced pancreatic cells (Figure S3C). We found that ALX-induced hyperglycemia was corrected within 2 weeks by intraductal infusion of AAV-PM, but not with control AAV-GFP mice (Figure 1B). We also saw a significant improvement in the glucose response (intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test, IPGTT) in ALX-treated, AAV-PM-infused mice at 4 weeks after viral infusion (Figure 1C). Moreover, beta cell mass significantly increased in ALX-mice receiving AAV-PM (0.84 ± 0.06 mg), compared to mice receiving AAV-GFP (0.09 ± 0.01 mg) at 4 weeks after viral infusion, reaching more than 60% of the beta cell mass of untreated mice (UT, no ALX, no virus; 1.35 ± 0.11 mg) (Figure 1D).

https://openalex.org/W2783523019,"Indigo is an ancient dye uniquely capable of producing the signature tones in blue denim; however, the dyeing process requires chemical steps that are environmentally damaging. We describe a sustainable dyeing strategy that not only circumvents the use of toxic reagents for indigo chemical synthesis but also removes the need for a reducing agent for dye solubilization. This strategy utilizes a glucose moiety as a biochemical protecting group to stabilize the reactive indigo precursor indoxyl to form indican, preventing spontaneous oxidation to crystalline indigo during microbial fermentation. Application of a β-glucosidase removes the protecting group from indican, resulting in indigo crystal formation in the cotton fibers. We identified the gene coding for the glucosyltransferase PtUGT1 from the indigo plant Polygonum tinctorium and solved the structure of PtUGT1. Heterologous expression of PtUGT1 in Escherichia coli supported high indican conversion, and biosynthesized indican was used to dye cotton swatches and a garment."

The emergence of drug-resistant bacteria coupled with a lack of novel structural classes of antibiotics have made antibiotic resistance one of the most eminent threats to global health (May, 2014May M.

Therapeutic options and strategies are especially scarce for Gram-negative pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Boucher et al., 2013Boucher H.W. Talbot G.H. Benjamin Jr., D.K. Bradley J.

This versatile, opportunistic pathogen is a frequent cause of acute nosocomial infections as well as chronic infections in high-risk patient groups, such as those suffering from cystic fibrosis (CF) (Mesaros et al., 2007Mesaros N.

CF is a recessive lethal genetic disorder among the Caucasian population that is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene (Elborn et al., 2016Elborn J.S.

While intensive antibiotic treatment for the eradication of P. aeruginosa infections has been successful in young patients, eradication ultimately fails, leading to the chronic infections experienced by most adult CF patients (Folkesson et al., 2012Folkesson A.

Pulmonol. 2004; 37: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). During chronic infection, antibiotic treatments can temporarily reduce airway infection and inflammation, thus extending the periods of stable disease status and maintained lung function (Fodor et al., 2012Fodor A.A.

The adult cystic fibrosis airway microbiota is stable over time and infection type, and highly resilient to antibiotic treatment of exacerbations.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e45001Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the ability of P. aeruginosa to sustain chronic infection and resist antibiotic treatment is associated with decline in lung function, respiratory failure, and death in CF patients (Hauser et al., 2011Hauser A.R.

The antibiotic resistance of P. aeruginosa is driven by several factors in CF patients, including the activation of chromosomally encoded resistance mechanisms, such as decreased production of the outer membrane porin, inducible chromosomal β-lactamase AmpC, and overexpression of several efflux systems (Lister et al., 2009Lister P.D.

Convergent evolution and adaptation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa within patients with cystic fibrosis.Nat. Genet. 2015; 47: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The main efflux pumps are tripartite systems consisting of a resistance nodulation cell division (RND) transporter, a membrane fusion protein (MFP), and an outer membrane factor (OMF). MexAB-OprM, MexCD-OprJ, MexEF-OprN, and MexXY-OprM are the main efflux pumps that expel functionally and structurally dissimilar antibiotics (Li et al., 2015Li X.-Z. Plésiat P. Nikaido H.

When Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus evolve resistance toward specific antibiotics, they also develop sensitivity toward other antibiotics (Baym et al., 2016Baym M. Stone L.K. Kishony R.

Evol. 2015; 32: 1175-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This observation led to the proposal of a new, rational drug treatment paradigm termed collateral sensitivity cycling, in which sequential drug treatments are designed to exploit collateral sensitivity resulting from resistance evolution (Imamovic and Sommer, 2013Imamovic L. Sommer M.O.A. Use of collateral sensitivity networks to design drug cycling protocols that avoid resistance development.Sci. Transl. Med. 2013; 5: 204ra132Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Collateral sensitivity has also been demonstrated in cancer cell lines (Hall et al., 2009Hall M.D. Handley M.D. Gottesman M.M. Is resistance useless? Multidrug resistance and collateral sensitivity.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2009; 30: 546-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and was recently successfully deployed for treatment of Ph(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia in an animal model (Zhao et al., 2016Zhao B. Sedlak J.C. Srinivas R. Creixell P. Pritchard J.R. Tidor B. Lauffenburger D.A. Hemann M.T. Exploiting temporal collateral sensitivity in tumor clonal evolution.Cell. 2016; 165: 234-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Collateral sensitivity may be particularly useful for optimizing treatments of chronic infections since their nature and severity warrants and requires tailored treatment strategies. Chronic lung infections of CF patients caused by P. aeruginosa may be a useful clinical model to study the evolution of collateral sensitivity in response to antibiotic therapy. While a recent study reported a lack of collateral sensitivity in clinical isolates from CF patients (Jansen et al., 2016Jansen G. Mahrt N. Tueffers L. Barbosa C. Harjes M. Adolph G. Friedrichs A. Kreinz-Weinreich A. Rosenstiel P. Schulenburg H. Association between clinical antibiotic resistance and susceptibility of Pseudomonas in the cystic fibrosis lung.Evol. Med. Public Heal. 2016; 2016: 182-194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the study did not investigate relative changes in strain susceptibility, and, thus, collateral sensitivity might be missed due to the lack of appropriate baseline controls. Moreover, if evolutionary tradeoffs, such as collateral sensitivity, do not occur in vivo, then ever-increasing resistance would be the consequence of decades of antibiotic exposure. Yet, previous phenotypic characterization of CF isolates did not observe such monotonic increase in antibiotic resistance over time (López-Causapé et al., 2013López-Causapé C. Rojo-Molinero E. Mulet X. Cabot G. Moyà B. Figuerola J. Togores B. Pérez J.L. Oliver A. Clonal dissemination, emergence of mutator lineages and antibiotic resistance evolution in Pseudomonas aeruginosa cystic fibrosis chronic lung infection.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e71001Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we hypothesized that P. aeruginosa might evolve collateral sensitivity in response to antibiotic exposure both in vitro and in patients and that these vulnerabilities modulate population dynamics during antibiotic treatment. To elucidate the collateral sensitivity network of drug-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa, PAO1 were experimentally evolved in media that resembled the chemical composition encountered in the lungs of CF patients (SCFM) (Palmer et al., 2007Palmer K.L. Aye L.M. Whiteley M. Nutritional cues control Pseudomonas aeruginosa multicellular behavior in cystic fibrosis sputum.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 8079-8087Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Twenty-four clinically relevant antibiotics that included anti-pseudomonal antibiotics and other drugs were chosen from eight chemical classes affecting different targets in P. aeruginosa (Table 1). To exclude possible effects on resistance phenotypes from adaptation to novel growth conditions, we adapted the ancestral PA01 strain to SCFM for 10 days as a media control (WTE). At the last day of the adaptive evolution experiment, all lineages could grow in the media with antibiotic concentrations exceeding the clinical breakpoint defined by EUCAST for P. aeruginosa (Table 1; Figures S1A–S1F) (EUCAST, 2016EUCAST 2016 The European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. MIC Clinical breakpoints version 6.0. http://www.eucast.org/.Google Scholar). Collateral sensitivity or collateral resistance was defined as a decrease or increase in the MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) of the antibiotic-resistant strain relative to the wild-type adapted to SCFM (WTE) (Figures S1G–S1I) (Imamovic and Sommer, 2013Imamovic L. Sommer M.O.A. Use of collateral sensitivity networks to design drug cycling protocols that avoid resistance development.Sci. Transl. Med. 2013; 5: 204ra132Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). To confirm the robustness of our susceptibility tests, we measured the significance of the fold increase or decrease in resistance relative to the WTE (see STAR Methods). We observed that collateral sensitivity toward ampicillin decreased by 8.5-fold for ciprofloxacin-resistant strain (p value 3.42e−21, t test). Increase in susceptibility for other antibiotics such as amikacin and colistin was 2.5- and 1.5-fold relative to the WTE; yet, in both cases, we observed that collateral sensitivity observed was statistically significant (p value 7.87e−55 and 2.07e−290, t test, respectively) (Figure S1J).Table 1List of Antibiotics Used in the StudyAntibioticAntibiotic AbbreviationClass (sub-class)Class AbbreviationTargetEUCAST BreakpointsAmikacinAMIaminoglycosideAprotein synthesis, 30S16GentamicinGENaminoglycosideAprotein synthesis, 30S4TobramycinTOBaminoglycosideAprotein synthesis, 30S4CiprofloxacinCIPquinoloneQDNA gyrase1LevofloxacinLEVquinoloneQDNA gyrase2AmpicillinAMPβ-lactam (penicillin)Bcell walln.a.PiperacillinPIPβ-lactam (penicillin)Bcell wall16CarbenicillinCARβ-lactam (penicillin)Bcell walln.a.TicarcillinTICβ-lactam (penicillin)Bcell wall16AztreonamAZEβ-lactam (monobactam)Bcell wall16CefepimeCFPβ-lactam (cephalosporin)Bcell wall8CefuroximeCFXβ-lactam (cephalosporin)Bcell walln.a.CeftazidimeCFZβ-lactam (cephalosporin)Bcell wall8MeropenemMERβ-lactam (carbapenem)Bcell wall8ImipenemIMIβ-lactam (carbapenem)Bcell wall8MinocyclineMINtetracyclineTprotein synthesis, 30Sn.a.DoxycyclineDOXtetracyclineTprotein synthesis, 30Sn.a.AzithromycinAZYmacrolideMprotein synthesis, 50Sn.a.ErythromycinERImacrolideMprotein synthesis, 50Sn.a.ClarithromycinCLAmacrolideMprotein synthesis, 50Sn.a.ColistinCOLpolymyxinPlipopolysaccharide4FosfomycinFOSfosfomycinFcell wall biogenesisn.a.RifampicinRIFrifamycinRRNA synthesisn.a.Trimethoprim/SulfamethoxazoleTMSantifolateCcombination folic acid pathway/ synthesis of dihydrofolic acidn.a.n.a., no EUCAST breakpoints listed (EUCAST, 2016EUCAST 2016 The European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing.

Given that the majority of resistant strains (75%) were collaterally sensitive to at least one antibiotic (Figure 1A; Table S1), we were able to construct a collateral sensitivity network for P. aeruginosa (Figures 1B and S2A). We simulated the number of collateral sensitivity cycles comprising: (1) all antibiotics in the study and (2) anti-pseudomonal antibiotics that have EUCAST-defined resistance breakpoints for P. aeruginosa (Table 1). For EUCAST-defined anti-pseudomonal antibiotics, we detected five collateral sensitivity cycles including two and three drugs (Figure 1C; Table S2). However, expanding the simulation for collateral sensitivity cycles to all antibiotics tested, the majority of antibiotics exhibiting collateral sensitivity (78%) could be employed in collateral sensitivity cycling. The number of simulated collateral sensitivity cycles including two and three drugs reached 18 and 51 cycles, respectively (Figures 1C and S2B).Figure S2Complex Networks of Interactions Based on the Collateral Susceptibility Profiles, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Collateral sensitivity network.

Exploring the effects of exposure of drugs beyond typical anti-pseudomonal range is relevant for designing treatment strategies since the CF airways are frequently infected by complex microbiota, including potentially pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenza, Burkholderia cepacia, or Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (Parkins and Floto, 2015Parkins M.D. Floto R.A.

Fibros. 2015; 14: 293-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, Willner et al., 2012Willner D. Haynes M.R. Furlan M. Schmieder R. Lim Y.W. Rainey P.B. Rohwer F. Conrad D. Spatial distribution of microbial communities in the cystic fibrosis lung.ISME J. 2012; 6: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These bacteria may be treated with drugs toward which P. aeruginosa is considered intrinsically resistant or not used in treatment due to quick resistance development. Intriguingly, we observed changes in collateral susceptibility profiles for P. aeruginosa strains exposed to such drugs (Figure 1A), including trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMS) (Table 1), which was used in some centers for the treatment of S. aureus infections in CF patients (Gibson et al., 2003Gibson R.L. Burns J.L. Ramsey B.W. Pathophysiology and management of pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis.Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2003; 168: 918-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar). The TMS-exposed PAO1 strain became collaterally sensitive toward aminoglycosides, polymyxin, and several β-lactam antibiotics. Simultaneously, the TMS-exposed PAO1 strain conferred resistance toward quinolone and tetracycline drugs (Figure 1A). These results suggest that, following treatment of S. aureus using TMS, P. aeruginosa treatment with aminoglycosides would be more effective than quinolones. This finding supports the hypothesis that the patient’s treatment history should be considered in order to exploit specific vulnerabilities of P. aeruginosa that result even from management of other pathogens. To systematically elucidate the similarity of susceptibility phenotypes between the evolved strains, we computed Spearman correlation coefficients (ρ) for each pairwise comparison of their normalized susceptibility profiles (see STAR Methods). We detected 107 significant correlations (p < 0.05, a two-tailed significance test) between resistant strains. Interestingly, 67 (60%) pairwise comparisons had high positive correlation coefficients for strains resistant to drugs from different chemical classes suggesting convergent phenotypes (Figure S3A; Table S3). Among those strains were tetracycline- and macrolide- and quinolone-resistant strains. In contrast, 40 pairwise comparisons had a negative correlation between their susceptibility profiles (p < 0.05) suggesting orthogonal phenotypic states. Notably, negative correlations of susceptibility profiles were observed in 90% of cases between polymyxin- and β-lactam-resistant strains (Figure S3A). For instance, colistin- and ceftazidime-resistant strains had strong negatively correlated susceptibility (ρ = −0.74; p < 0.0001) (Figure S3A; Table S3). Interestingly, several strains resistant to β-lactams (aztreonam, carbenicillin, and ampicillin) also displayed reciprocal collateral sensitivity with colistin (Figure 1A). To further examine the phenotypic states of the resistant strains, we reduced the dimensionality of the data using principal component analysis (PCA). This analysis revealed that resistant strains are divided into four groups that are positioned in different regions of PCA (Figure 2A), highlighting the convergence toward specific phenotypic states in response to antibiotic exposure. β-lactams, aminoglycoside, quinolone, and polymyxin antibiotics are commonly applied for the treatment of lung infections in CF patients. Notably, strains resistant to these antibiotic classes were positioned in different regions of PCA indicating that understanding the convergence toward drug-specific phenotypes for these drugs could inform treatment strategies. Interestingly, region II in the PCA plot included strains resistant to quinolones, macrolides, and tetracyclines (Figure 2A), highlighting that these different drug classes select for similar phenotypic states with strongly correlated susceptibility profiles (ρ = 0.84 – 0.97, p < 0.0001, Spearman correlation) (Figure S3A; Table S3). To explore further the phenotypic convergence in response to antibiotic exposure, we investigated whether antibiotic resistance evolution from different genetic starting points would lead to convergent evolution of their susceptibility profiles. We selected five clinical CF isolates from the DK2 clone type that share a common ancestor but have diverged during years of isolation in three different hosts (Marvig et al., 2013Marvig R.L. Johansen H.K. Molin S. Jelsbak L. Genome analysis of a transmissible lineage of pseudomonas aeruginosa reveals pathoadaptive mutations and distinct evolutionary paths of hypermutators.PLoS Genet. 2013; 9: e1003741Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We observed changes in susceptibility for all adapted clinical isolates, indicating that evolutionary trajectories toward collateral sensitivity can occur in divergent lineages (with diverse phenotypic and genotypic starting point) (Figure S3B). Importantly, several collateral sensitivity interactions remained preserved in the majority of strains tested (Figure S3C). For instance, resistance development for ciprofloxacin was consistently associated with collateral sensitivity toward aminoglycoside antibiotics in all different genetic backgrounds. In addition, the fold change relative to the ancestral strains was higher in clinical isolates than observed in PAO1 evolution. Notably, the clinical isolates evolved to azithromycin and ciprofloxacin resistance (173-1991-CIP and 173-1991-AZY) were 32-fold more sensitive to colistin antibiotics then the WT (Figure S3C; Table S1). Profound collateral sensitivity was also previously observed for E. coli clinical isolates (Imamovic and Sommer, 2013Imamovic L. Sommer M.O.A. Use of collateral sensitivity networks to design drug cycling protocols that avoid resistance development.Sci. Transl. Med. 2013; 5: 204ra132Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), indicating the potential for exploiting collateral sensitivity to optimize antibiotic regimens. To explore the link between the phenotypic changes of laboratory-evolved resistant PAO1 and clinical isolates, we determined the Spearman correlation coefficients for their resistance profiles. Overall, this analysis shows that exposure of different P. aeruginosa strains to a particular drug tends to increase the correlation between them (Figure 2B; Table S4). When considering selective antibiotic pressure in clinical isolates, all clinical isolates exposed to aztreonam and ciprofloxacin as well as 80% of azithromycin- and tobramycin-resistant DK2 strains increased the correlation of their susceptibility profiles to the respective antibiotic-resistant PAO1 strains (Figure 2B). For instance, the correlation coefficient for clinical isolate 173 evolved to ciprofloxacin changed from a negative ρ = −0.67 (p < 0.01) to a positive ρ = 0.65 (p < 0.01) (Table S4). The exception was the colistin-resistant strain, for which no changes in correlation ρ were linked to the colistin-resistant PAO1 strain, indicating that the difference with PAO1 might be reflected in the different genetic background between DK2 and PAO1 (Gutu et al., 2015Gutu A.D. Rodgers N.S. Park J. Moskowitz S.M. Pseudomonas aeruginosa high-level resistance to polymyxins and other antimicrobial peptides requires cprA, a gene that is disrupted in the PAO1 strain.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2015; 59: 5377-5387Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Using PCA we observed that the phenotypic states of the ciprofloxacin and aztreonam evolved clinical isolates shifted their corresponding resistant PAO1 strain in response to antibiotic resistance evolution (Figures 2C and 2D). Indeed, this analysis indicates that for some antibiotics, exposure and subsequent resistance evolution leads to convergence toward specific phenotypic states in diverse phenotypic and genotypic backgrounds. To explore the genetic basis of phenotypic changes in susceptibility profiles, we sequenced the genomes of experimentally evolved strains. We observed that the impact of drug exposure on genome-wide evolutionary paths causing collateral resistance and sensitivity were associated with drug resistance genes also found to be undergoing selection in chronically infected CF patients (Marvig et al., 2013Marvig R.L. Johansen H.K. Molin S. Jelsbak L. Genome analysis of a transmissible lineage of pseudomonas aeruginosa reveals pathoadaptive mutations and distinct evolutionary paths of hypermutators.PLoS Genet. 2013; 9: e1003741Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Mutations in seven out of nine pathoadaptive, antibiotic resistance genes (fusA1, ampC, ampD, gyrA, gyrB, mexB, and pmrB) were observed in our adaptive evolution experiment (Figure S4A; Table S5). Uniformly, PAO1 strains resistant to quinolone, macrolide, and tetracyclines had mutations in the pathoadaptive gene nfxB (Marvig et al., 2015aMarvig R.L. Sommer L.M. Molin S. Johansen H.K.

Multiple immune-cell types can infiltrate tumors and promote progression and metastasis through different mechanisms, including immunosuppression. How distinct genetic alterations in tumors affect the composition of the immune landscape is currently unclear. Here, we characterized the immune-cell composition of prostate cancers driven by the loss of the critical tumor suppressor gene Pten, either alone or in combination with the loss of Trp53, Zbtb7a or Pml. We observed a striking quantitative and qualitative heterogeneity that was directly dependent on the specific genetic events in the tumor and ranged from 'cold', noninflamed tumors to massively infiltrated landscapes—results with important therapeutic implications. Further, we showed these qualitative differences in transcriptomic analysis of human prostate cancer samples. These data suggest that patient stratification on the basis of integrated genotypic–immunophenotypic analyses may be necessary for successful clinical trials and tailored precision immunological therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2782248454,"The transition from the fed to the fasted state necessitates a shift from carbohydrate to fat metabolism that is thought to be mostly orchestrated by reductions in plasma insulin concentrations. Here, we show in awake rats that insulinopenia per se does not cause this transition but that both hypoleptinemia and insulinopenia are necessary. Furthermore, we show that hypoleptinemia mediates a glucose-fatty acid cycle through activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, resulting in increased white adipose tissue (WAT) lipolysis rates and increased hepatic acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) content, which are essential to maintain gluconeogenesis during starvation. We also show that in prolonged starvation, substrate limitation due to reduced rates of glucose-alanine cycling lowers rates of hepatic mitochondrial anaplerosis, oxidation, and gluconeogenesis. Taken together, these data identify a leptin-mediated glucose-fatty acid cycle that integrates responses of the muscle, WAT, and liver to promote a shift from carbohydrate to fat oxidation and maintain glucose homeostasis during starvation."
https://openalex.org/W2782456186,"Summary Peptides have great potential to combat antibiotic resistance. While many platforms can screen peptides for their ability to bind to target cells, there are virtually no platforms that directly assess the functionality of peptides. This limitation is exacerbated when identifying antimicrobial peptides because the phenotype, death, selects against itself and has caused a scientific bottleneck that confines research to a few naturally occurring classes of antimicrobial peptides. We have used this seeming dissonance to develop Surface Localized Antimicrobial Display (SLAY), a platform that allows screening of unlimited numbers of peptides of any length, composition, and structure in a single tube for antimicrobial activity. Using SLAY, we screened ∼800,000 random peptide sequences for antimicrobial function and identified thousands of active sequences, dramatically increasing the number of known antimicrobial sequences. SLAY hits present with different potential mechanisms of peptide action and access to areas of antimicrobial physicochemical space beyond what nature has evolved. Video Abstract"

https://openalex.org/W2781607143,"Summary Motor output varies along the rostro-caudal axis of the tetrapod spinal cord. At limb levels, ∼60 motor pools control the alternation of flexor and extensor muscles about each joint, whereas at thoracic levels as few as 10 motor pools supply muscle groups that support posture, inspiration, and expiration. Whether such differences in motor neuron identity and muscle number are associated with segmental distinctions in interneuron diversity has not been resolved. We show that select combinations of nineteen transcription factors that specify lumbar V1 inhibitory interneurons generate subpopulations enriched at limb and thoracic levels. Specification of limb and thoracic V1 interneurons involves the Hox gene Hoxc9 independently of motor neurons. Thus, early Hox patterning of the spinal cord determines the identity of V1 interneurons and motor neurons. These studies reveal a developmental program of V1 interneuron diversity, providing insight into the organization of inhibitory interneurons associated with differential motor output."

The biomechanical basis and neural codes for these features are not completely understood, particularly during active sensation. A fundamental question is how discrete geometric features (local shapes) are represented simultaneously with macroscopic features like texture. During active whisker sensation, rodents rhythmically sweep the whiskers against objects, inducing whisker bends, vibrations, and discrete high-velocity, high-acceleration micromotions called stick-slips, here termed “slips” (Chen et al., 2015Chen J.L.

Which tactile features are sensed by slips is only partially understood. In the “slip hypothesis” of texture encoding, higher friction on rough surfaces increases slip rate and amplitude, driving higher mean firing rate in S1 (Jadhav and Feldman, 2010Jadhav S.P. Feldman D.E. Texture coding in the whisker system.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2010; 20: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, Zuo et al., 2015Zuo Y. Safaai H. Notaro G. Mazzoni A. Panzeri S.

However, other kinematic and mechanical features, such as whisker bend, may also contribute to roughness coding (Boubenec et al., 2014Boubenec Y. Claverie L.N. Shulz D.E. Debrégeas G.

Brain Res. 2015; 233: 2869-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and whether slips and slip-evoked spikes are sufficiently robust to predict rough versus smooth surfaces on a single-trial basis remains unknown. We hypothesized that slips also play a role in coding local shape. In this model, slips occur more often when the moving whisker “bumps” over local surface irregularities, and slip-evoked spikes may therefore be an instantaneous (temporal) code for spatially precise surface features (Arabzadeh et al., 2005Arabzadeh E. Zorzin E. Diamond M.E. Neuronal encoding of texture in the whisker sensory pathway.PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e17Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, Schwarz, 2016Schwarz C. The slip hypothesis: tactile perception and its neuronal bases.Trends Neurosci. 2016; 39: 449-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). If so, the same slips and slip-locked spikes could underlie both instantaneous coding of local spatial features and coding of macroscopic texture by firing rate. Simultaneous temporal and rate codes have been recently observed in primate and rodent S1 (Harvey et al., 2013Harvey M.A. Saal H.P. Dammann 3rd, J.F. Bensmaia S.J. Multiplexing stimulus information through rate and temporal codes in primate somatosensory cortex.PLoS Biol. 2013; 11: e1001558Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, Zuo et al., 2015Zuo Y.

Biol. 2015; 25: 357-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), but how these codes arise during active sensation is unknown. To address these questions, we trained head-fixed mice to discriminate smooth from rough surfaces while running past surfaces on a virtual track. Rough stimuli consisted of raised gratings with 2–10 mm spatial period and sandpaper. Active whisking and forward running generated complex sampling trajectories across surfaces. Slips and slip-evoked spikes were temporally precise and accumulated along ridges of raised gratings with ∼1 mm spatial precision, recapitulating grating patterns. At the same time, time-averaged firing of individual units predicted rough versus smooth trials with 85% accuracy. Both slip-evoked spikes and an additional non-slip signal in slip-insensitive units contributed to this mean firing rate code for roughness. Thus, slips and slip-evoked spikes both provide an instantaneous signal for spatially localized features and contribute to a slower firing rate signal that encodes macroscopic roughness. We trained head-fixed mice running on a passive disk treadmill to discriminate smooth from rough surface patches presented on a rotating cylinder (Figure 1). Surface patches were 3 cm long and consisted of a smooth surface, raised ridge gratings (2, 4, 8, or 10 mm spatial period), or coarse sandpaper (P150). Sandpaper and gratings were collectively termed “Rough” stimuli, as in past studies (Carvell and Simons, 1990Carvell G.E. Simons D.J. Biometric analyses of vibrissal tactile discrimination in the rat.J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 2638-2648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Morita et al., 2011Morita T. Kang H. Wolfe J. Jadhav S.P.

Safaai H. Notaro G. Mazzoni A. Panzeri S. Diamond M.E. Complementary contributions of spike timing and spike rate to perceptual decisions in rat S1 and S2 cortex.Curr. Biol. 2015; 25: 357-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Mice ran and actively whisked against the cylinder, which rotated in proportion to the mouse’s running velocity, creating a 1D virtual track. Mice were trained in a Go/No-go task design to lick for water reward when they felt any of the Rough stimuli and to withhold licking for Smooth stimuli. Training was performed in the dark, with stimuli only accessible by the whiskers. Thus, this was a virtual tactile foraging task in which mice were rewarded for finding rough patches along an otherwise smooth cylinder surface. The task consisted of discrete trials that began when the cylinder, presenting a smooth surface, was translated medially to contact the whiskers (Figure 1B; static introduction). The mouse then self-initiated a trial by running forward, causing the stimulus cylinder to rotate proportionally to run velocity (Figures 1B and 1C). This brought a randomly chosen stimulus patch, either smooth or rough, into whisker contact and opened a 1.5–2 s response window in which mice licked or withheld licking to indicate choice. On Rough trials, licking above a threshold rate in the response window triggered water reward (Hit). On Smooth trials, licking was scored as a False Alarm (FA) and triggered a time out. No action was taken on Correct Rejection (CR) and Miss trials (Movie S1). An example Hit trial is shown in Figure 1C. Cylinder rotation stopped when mice ran to the end of the stimulus patch. After the response window, the cylinder was retracted (inter-trial epoch). Rough and Smooth trials were presented in 50:50 ratio, and 7% of trials were Catch trials in which the cylinder was translated only partially to the whiskers, so that the mouse whisked in air. Only C1 and C2 whiskers were intact. Multiple precautions ensured that mice solved the task using whisker tactile cues, and not auditory, visual, or olfactory cues (STAR Methods). During each trial, we imaged C1 and C2 whiskers in the rostrocaudal plane using a 1D CCD imaging system (4 kHz sampling rate). From this we calculated time series of whisker angle relative to the follicle and whisker contact position on the surface. We calculated the time and spatial position of first whisker contact with the leading edge of Rough stimuli (i.e., the onset of the first ridge or the P150 sandpaper), or with the corresponding position on the Smooth stimulus (Figure 1C). First contact was always by the C2 whisker, which is more rostral on the face. Substantial trial-to-trial variability in mouse locomotion and active whisking led to heterogeneous whisker exploration patterns across trials (Movies S2 and S3). Calibration on a subset of trials using high-speed 2D imaging showed that our average error in estimating contact position was ∼1 mm (Figure S1). Mice were trained in stages until they reached criterion performance in discriminating Rough and Smooth trials with random, closed-loop stimulus presentation (>75% correct for 2 consecutive days). Training took 21 ± 13 sessions (n = 7 mice; Figure S2A) with all whiskers intact, at which point all right whiskers except C1 and C2 were trimmed. Final discrimination was well above chance (78% ± 2.5% correct, 7 mice, total of 244 days above criterion), with significantly more licks to Rough trials than Smooth trials (p < 0.001, t test; Figure 1D). This corresponded to a total d’ of 1.63. All behavioral, whisker, and neural data measurements were made in these seven mice. There was no difference in Hit rate for individual Rough stimuli (p = 0.48, one-way ANOVA). However, Hit rate was weakly correlated with spatial frequency (r2 = 0.14, p = 0.038; Figure 1D). Licks occurred 781 ± 29 ms after First contact on Hit trials (n = 1,215 imaged trials), but were uniformly distributed in time on FA trials (Figure 1E). Mean running speed did not differ between Rough and Smooth trials (p = 0.21, paired t test; Figures S2B and S2C). Thus, mice learned to discriminate rough and smooth surfaces in a closed-loop virtual track using two intact whiskers. We first tested whether whisker slips could underlie discrimination of Rough versus Smooth texture. Slips are known to correlate with roughness on sandpaper and irregular 2D surfaces (Ritt et al., 2008Ritt J.T. Andermann M.L. Moore C.I.

Texture coding in the rat whisker system: slip-stick versus differential resonance.PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e215Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We analyzed whisker slips and other whisker kinematics in a palpation window from 50 ms before First contact to 200 ms before the first lick (Figure 2A). This truncation avoids contamination by licks and behavioral decision. We identified all slips defined by whisker acceleration above a ± 2.5 SD threshold in this window (Figure 2B). This threshold was chosen because slips >± 2.5 SD maximally drive spikes in S1 single units (see below). Palpation window duration was 722 ± 454 ms (mean ± SD) and varied with running speed and lick time across trials. On non-lick trials, a 650 ms window was used. We compared C2 whisker slip amplitude (absolute peak acceleration), slip rate, and mean speed (absolute whisker velocity) in the palpation window on Smooth versus Rough trials. Smooth surfaces generated 28.3 ± 0.8 slips/s at a mean amplitude of 1.0 ± 0.01°/ms2 (n = 3,355 Smooth trials; 29 imaging sessions in 7 mice). Collectively, rough surfaces generated 52.0 ± 1.2 slips/s at a mean amplitude of 1.2 ± 0.01°/ms2 in these same sessions (n = 3,223 Rough trials). We Z scored slip rate and amplitude on all stimuli to Smooth data values in each mouse. Slip rate and amplitude significantly increased on Rough surfaces and decreased in Air, relative to Smooth. Within Rough stimuli, slip rate and amplitude increased with spatial frequency, while mean whisker speed decreased (Figure 2C). The decrease in whisker speed was associated with reduced whisking amplitude (Figures S2D and S2E) but constant mean whisking frequency (18 ± 0.1 Hz; Figures S2F and S2G). Therefore, surface roughness was accompanied by increased slip rate and amplitude, as observed previously on sandpapers (Jadhav et al., 2009Jadhav S.P. Wolfe J. Feldman D.E. Sparse temporal coding of elementary tactile features during active whisker sensation.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 792-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, Wolfe et al., 2008Wolfe J. Hill D.N.

Texture coding in the rat whisker system: slip-stick versus differential resonance.PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e215Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), but with decreased mean speed, due to lower whisk amplitude. Because each whisk generates few slips, it has been unclear whether slips can accurately code roughness on a single-trial basis (Chen et al., 2015Chen J.L. Margolis D.J. Stankov A. Sumanovski L.T. Schneider B.L. Helmchen F. Pathway-specific reorganization of projection neurons in somatosensory cortex during learning.Nat.

Sparse temporal coding of elementary tactile features during active whisker sensation.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 792-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). To test this, we fit a general linear model (GLM) to classify Smooth and Rough stimuli based on C1 and C2 whisker slip rate and amplitude (STAR Methods). This model predicted stimulus identity on hold-out trials with 77.6% ± 11% accuracy (Figure 2D). This performance was significantly above chance (p < 0.001, one-way t test) and was not different from mouse behavioral discrimination accuracy (78% ± 4%) on the same trials (p = 0.91, paired t test; Figure 2D). To examine whether slips predict the mouse’s behavioral decision to lick or not lick, we compared slip rate and amplitude during trials that elicited lick responses versus trials with the same surfaces that elicited no licks. We found higher slip rate and slip amplitude during FA versus CR trials on Smooth surfaces (Figure 2E, top). There was a similar trend for Hit versus Miss trials on Rough surfaces. To examine whether this difference in whisker slips was sufficient to predict lick behavior, the slip GLM described above was refit to classify Lick and No Lick trials. We then tested the model on slip data from held-out Hit, Miss, FA, and CR trials. The model indeed predicted licks significantly more often on Hit than Miss trials, and on FA than CR trials (Figure 2E, bottom). This suggests that trial-to-trial variability in slip sensory data biases lick responses, and that excess slips contribute to FA licks on Smooth trials. Thus, slips are a potent cue for roughness and carry sufficient information to explain average mouse behavior and to accurately discriminate Smooth versus Rough surfaces on single trials. How the whisker system detects specific local surface features, like ridges, is unknown. Because ridges are raised and have spatially sharp edges, they are likely to increase local whisker bend and the local coefficient of friction, which may increase the probability of stick-slip events. To test whether slips cluster at ridges, we plotted the prevalence of slips as a function of position of whisker contact on the stimulus surface (Figure 3A). Slips were spatially modulated and tended to cluster at the leading edge of ridges, and of the P150 sandpaper (Figure 3B). This was consistent across trials and mice (Figures 3B and 3C). Slips tracked the spatial period of gratings for 4–10 mm periods, but were less spatially precise for the 2 mm grating. This may be because the whisker often bent to span across two bars on the 2 mm grating, instead of separately contacting individual ridges (Figures S3A and S3B). To confirm that ridges induce whisker acceleration transients, we calculated the ridge-triggered average |acceleration| as the C2 whisker first crossed a ridge, compared to when it first crossed an equivalent cylinder position on the Smooth stimulus (“fictive ridge”). On ridges, C2 whisker acceleration increased significantly relative to pre-ridge baseline and was greater than acceleration on fictive ridges (Figure 3D; STAR Methods). The slight increase in acceleration during fictive ridge crossing reflects a bias in selecting first ridge crossings, which are constrained to be moments of forward whisker movement. Randomly sampled whisker traces from Smooth trials, which include both forward and backward whisker movement, showed no bias (Figure S3C). Thus, ridges cause an increase in the local number and magnitude of stick-slip events compared with smooth surfaces. To determine how whisker touch, roughness, and local ridge geometry are encoded in S1, we made extracellular single-unit recordings using multi-site linear probes while mice performed the Rough-Smooth discrimination task. Recordings were made in C1 or C2 whisker columns, targeted by intrinsic signal optical imaging, and confirmed by histological recovery of fluorescent tracer relative to cytochrome oxidase-stained barrels (Figure 4A). We isolated single units by spike-sorting from four adjacent channels treated as one tetrode (Figure 4B). Overall, 170 C1 column units and 256 C2 column units were recorded in 15 penetrations in 5 mice spanning L2/3 to L6. We distinguished fast spiking (FS) from regular spiking (RS) units based on trough-to-peak width of the average spike waveform (Figure 4C). We determined unit depth relative to the L4-L5A border, identified by current source density analysis of local field potentials that were recorded simultaneously with spikes (Figures 4D and S4; STAR Methods). Firing rates were low and skewed in L2/3, L4, and L6, and higher in L5 (Figure 4D). Median firing rates per layer were as follows: L2/3, 0.45 ± 0.14 Hz; L4, 1.12 ± 0.22 Hz; L5A, 3.29 ± 0.82 Hz; L5B, 5.10 ± 1.26 Hz; L6, 1.24 ± 0.41 Hz (±CI95). To test whether units responded to whisker-cylinder touch, we compared firing rates in 650 ms windows before and after the static introduction of the stimulus cylinder at trial onset (Figure 5A). Touch onset was defined as occurring 400 ms before the final stimulus cylinder position, corresponding to 2.22 ± 0.05 cm from the mystacial pad. As expected in S1, touch drove firing rate changes in the majority of units (85.9%, 366/426), 89.6% of which were touch excited and 10.4% of which were touch inhibited (Figure 5B). Responsive units were distributed evenly across layers and across RS and FS units (Figure 5C). Nearly all L4 and L2/3 units were touch excited. Touch-inhibited units tended to be RS units located in L5-L6 (78.0%, n = 46; Figure 5C). To test how units encode Rough stimuli, we examined firing rates during smooth → rough transitions (Figure 5D; STAR Methods). Rough surface onset drove firing rate changes in 56.1% (239/426) of units, of which 74.1% were excited and 25.9% were inhibited (Figure 5E). In contrast, smooth → smooth transitions on Smooth trials did not systematically modulate firing rate (Figure S5A), and smooth → smooth and smooth → rough modulations were uncorrelated within units (r2 = 0.01, p = 0.02; Figure S5B). Thus, firing rate modulation in Rough trials was texture related. Roughness responsive units were found in both C1 and C2 columns, though C1 contained a slightly higher proportion of texture inhibited units (Figure S5C). Rough-responsive RS units were most prevalent outside L4 (Figure 5F), while rough-responsive FS units were evenly distributed across layers (p = 0.84, χ2 = 0.04, degrees of freedom [df] = 1). We compared the mean response to touch versus the mean response to roughness for each unit (Figure 5G; STAR Methods). While most units that increased firing to touch also increased to roughness, 31.8% of touch-increased units decreased firing to roughness, suggesting a non-monotonic response to increasing tactile intensity. How well mean S1 firing rate encodes roughness is unclear in behaving rodents (von Heimendahl et al., 2007von Heimendahl M. Itskov P.M. Arabzadeh E. Diamond M.E. Neuronal activity in rat barrel cortex underlying texture discrimination.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e305Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, Jadhav et al., 2009Jadhav S.P. Wolfe J. Feldman D.E.

Biol. 2015; 25: 357-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To address this, we compared firing rates on Rough versus Smooth trials during the palpation window, which ends just prior to behavioral decision. For each unit, firing rate on all trials was Z scored to Smooth trial firing rates (Figure 5H). Average firing was higher on Rough than Smooth trials (p < 0.001; paired t test, n = 426 units) and lower during epochs of whisking in air (p < 0.001; paired t test). Whisking in air consisted of Catch trials, which had rapid whisking, but no touch (Figure 2C), and quiescent inter-trial epochs. Thus, roughness elicits both increases and decreases in RS unit firing, with a net significant, but modest, increase in overall firing rate. In contrast, whisker-cylinder touch drives a more robust and uniform firing rate increase across S1 layers. To examine how S1 encodes local surface features, we detected columnar whisker slips and aligned S1 spikes relative to the slip peak (Figure 6A). Firing rate increased with increased slip amplitude in all cortical layers (Figure 6B). Responses were strongest for slips ≥2.5 SD (Figure S6A). We identified slip-sensitive (SS) units by comparing spike rate 20 ms before and after slip peaks for slips ≥2.5 SD (α = 0.05, paired t test). In total, 43.9% (187/426) of S1 units were SS, with the remainder considered not SS (NSS). Slip-evoked spikes were temporally precise (mean 5.6 ± 0.6 ms jitter, 85.5% of slip-excited neurons had <10 ms jitter [142/166]). Slip-excited units in L4 had the shortest slip response latency (6.4 ± 1 ms) and lowest temporal jitter (4 ± 1 ms, medians ± CI95; Figures S6B and S6C). C1 slips modestly suppressed spiking to C2 slips in C2 column units, but C2 slips did not suppress spiking in the C1 column (Figures S6D and S6E), consistent with known direction bias for surround suppression (Jacob et al., 2008Jacob V.

SS units were significantly more likely to be FS units (64.9%) than RS units (32.7%; p < 0.001, two-way z test of proportions; Figure 6C). In addition, SS FS units were almost exclusively slip excited (96.9%) compared with 79.8% of SS RS units (Figure 6C). Individual ridges also evoked spiking responses in S1. We measured ridge responsiveness by aligning spikes to time points when whiskers crossed onto or off of bars (ridge crossing) (Figure 6D). On average, units showed a small increase in firing rate to ridge crossing (Figure 6E). To identify ridge-sensitive (RDS) units, we compared firing rate 20 ms before and after ridge crossing (α = 0.05, paired t test). Unlike slips, only 11% of units were RDS (n = 48 units) with the highest proportion of RDS units in L5B (20%; Figure 6F). Ridges evoked firing rate increases in most RDS L2/3, L4, and L5B units, but decreases in most RDS L5A and L6 units (Figure 6F). SS and RDS units"

Socioeconomic, haemodynamic, anthropometric and health data were collected in the research centers of ELSA-Brasil. The presence of high blood pressure was identified when the systolic blood pressure was ≥140 mm Hg and/or the diastolic was ≥90 mm Hg. Alcohol consumption was estimated and categorized regarding consumption and pattern of ingestion. The Student's t-test, chi-squared and logistic regression tests were used for analysis, including potential co-variables of the model, and a 5% significance level was adopted.A dose-response relation was observed for the consumption of alcohol (g/week) in systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure. Alcohol consumption was associated with high blood pressure in men who reported moderate (OR = 1.69; 95%CI 1.35-2.11) and excessive (OR = 2.70; 95%CI 2.04-3.59) consumption. Women have nearly three times more chance of presenting elevated blood pressure when presenting excessive consumption (OR = 2.86, 95%CI 1.77-4.63), and binge drinkers who drink more than 2 to 3 times a month have approximately 70% more chance of presenting with elevated blood pressure, after adjusting for consumption of drinks with meals.The consumption of alcohol beverages increases the odds of elevated blood pressure, especially among excessive drinkers. Therefore alcohol consumption needs a more robust regulation in view of its impact on population health."
https://openalex.org/W2781659131,"Iron is universally important to cellular metabolism, and mitoferrin-1 and -2 have been proposed to be the iron importers of mitochondria, the cell's assembly plant of heme and iron–sulfur clusters. These iron-containing prosthetic groups are critical for a host of physiological processes ranging from oxygen transport and energy consumption to maintaining protein structural integrity. Mitoferrin-1 (Mfrn1) belongs to the mitochondrial carrier (MC) family and is atypical given its putative metallic cargo; most MCs transport nucleotides, amino acids, or other small- to medium-size metabolites. Despite the clear importance of Mfrn1 in iron utilization, its transport activity has not been demonstrated unambiguously. To bridge this knowledge gap, we have purified recombinant Mfrn1 under non-denaturing conditions and probed its metal ion–binding and transport functions. Isothermal titration calorimetry indicates that Mfrn1 has micromolar affinity for Fe(II), Mn(II), Co(II), and Ni(II). Mfrn1 was incorporated into defined liposomes, and iron transport was reconstituted in vitro, demonstrating that Mfrn1 can transport iron. Mfrn1 can also transport manganese, cobalt, copper, and zinc but discriminates against nickel. Experiments with candidate ligands for cellular labile iron reveal that Mfrn1 transports free iron and not a chelated iron complex and selects against alkali divalent ions. Extensive mutagenesis identified multiple residues that are crucial for metal binding, transport activity, or both. There is a clear abundance of residues with side chains that can coordinate first-row transition metal ions, suggesting that these could form primary or auxiliary metal-binding sites during the transport process."

To gain insights into the control of G1 length, we generated an E2F activity reporter that captures free E2F activity after dissociation from Rb sequestration and followed its kinetics of activation at the single-cell level, in real time. Our results demonstrate that its activity is precisely coordinated with S phase progression. Quantitative analysis indicates that there is a pre-S phase delay between E2F transcriptional dynamic and activity dynamics. This delay is variable among different cell types and is strongly modulated by the cyclin D/CDK4/6 complex activity through Rb phosphorylation. Our findings suggest that the main function of this complex is to regulate the appropriate timing of G1 length."

Targeting B-cells has been an effective approach in ameliorating both central and peripheral autoimmune diseases. However, there is a paucity of literature on the safety of continuous B-cell depletion over a long period of time.The aim of this study was to examine the long-term safety, incidence of infections, and malignancies in subjects receiving continuous therapy with a B-cell depleting agent rituximab over at least 3 years or longer.This was a retrospective study involving PIMND who received continuous cycles of rituximab infusions every 6 to 9 months for up to 7 years. The incidence of infection related adverse events (AE), serious adverse events (SAE), and malignancies were observed.There were a total of 32 AE and 4 SAE with rituximab treatment. The 3 SAE were noted after 9 cycles (48 months) and 1 SAE was observed after 11 cycles (60 months) of rituximab. There were no cases of Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and malignancies observed throughout the treatment period. Rituximab was well tolerated without any serious infusion reactions. Also, rituximab was found to be beneficial in treating PIMND over a 7-year period.This study demonstrates that long-term depletion of peripheral B-cells appears safe and efficacious in treating PIMND. Longer and larger prospective studies with rituximab are needed to carefully ascertain risks associated with chronic B-cell depletion, including malignancies. Recognizing that this is a small, retrospective study, such data nonetheless complement the growing literature documenting the safety and tolerability of B-cell depleting agents in neurological diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2781787692,"Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major obstacle in cancer treatment due to the ability of tumor cells to efflux chemotherapeutics via drug transporters (e.g. P-glycoprotein (Pgp; ABCB1)). Although the mechanism of Pgp-mediated drug efflux is known at the plasma membrane, the functional role of intracellular Pgp is unclear. Moreover, there has been intense focus on the tumor micro-environment as a target for cancer treatment. This investigation aimed to dissect the effects of tumor micro-environmental stress on subcellular Pgp expression, localization, and its role in MDR. These studies demonstrated that tumor micro-environment stressors (i.e. nutrient starvation, low glucose levels, reactive oxygen species, and hypoxia) induce Pgp-mediated drug resistance. This occurred by two mechanisms, where stressors induced 1) rapid Pgp internalization and redistribution via intracellular trafficking (within 1 h) and 2) hypoxia-inducible factor-1α expression after longer incubations (4–24 h), which up-regulated Pgp and was accompanied by lysosomal biogenesis. These two mechanisms increased lysosomal Pgp and facilitated lysosomal accumulation of the Pgp substrate, doxorubicin, resulting in resistance. This was consistent with lysosomal Pgp being capable of transporting substrates into lysosomes. Hence, tumor micro-environmental stressors result in: 1) Pgp redistribution to lysosomes; 2) increased Pgp expression; 3) lysosomal biogenesis; and 4) potentiation of Pgp substrate transport into lysosomes. In contrast to doxorubicin, when stress stimuli increased lysosomal accumulation of the cytotoxic Pgp substrate, di-2-pyridylketone 4,4-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT), this resulted in the agent overcoming resistance. Overall, this investigation describes a novel approach to overcoming resistance in the stressful tumor micro-environment."

Most of the tested isolates (71.05%) demonstrated at least one of the degradative properties, with Penicillium bilaiae as the most potent, since it tested positive in all four. The remaining isolates (28.95%) showed no deterioration capabilities and were hence considered unlikely to partake in the complex process of fungal deterioration of murals via the tested mechanisms. The obtained results clearly indicate that utilization of fast and simple plate assays can provide insight into the biodegradative potential of deteriogenic fungi and allow for their separation from allochthonous transients, a prerequisite for precise assessment of the amount of risk posed by a thriving mycobiota to mural paintings."
https://openalex.org/W2782190004,"Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) is a ubiquitously expressed, intracellular as well as extracellular protein with multiple modes of post-translational regulation, including an allosteric disulfide bond between Cys-370–Cys-371 that renders the enzyme inactive in the extracellular matrix.

https://openalex.org/W2783612887,"A luteinizing hormone–releasing hormone antagonist, used clinically for sex-steroid inhibition, promotes quiescence of hematopoietic stem cells and thereby promotes hematopoietic recovery and survival of lethally irradiated mice. There is a substantial unmet clinical need for new strategies to protect the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) pool and regenerate hematopoiesis after radiation injury from either cancer therapy or accidental exposure1,2. Increasing evidence suggests that sex hormones, beyond their role in promoting sexual dimorphism, regulate HSC self-renewal, differentiation, and proliferation3,4,5. We and others have previously reported that sex-steroid ablation promotes bone marrow (BM) lymphopoiesis and HSC recovery in aged and immunodepleted mice5,6,7. Here we found that a luteinizing hormone (LH)-releasing hormone antagonist (LHRH-Ant), currently in wide clinical use for sex-steroid inhibition, promoted hematopoietic recovery and mouse survival when administered 24 h after an otherwise-lethal dose of total-body irradiation (L-TBI). Unexpectedly, this protective effect was independent of sex steroids and instead relied on suppression of LH levels. Human and mouse long-term self-renewing HSCs (LT-HSCs) expressed high levels of the LH/choriogonadotropin receptor (LHCGR) and expanded ex vivo when stimulated with LH. In contrast, the suppression of LH after L-TBI inhibited entry of HSCs into the cell cycle, thus promoting HSC quiescence and protecting the cells from exhaustion. These findings reveal a role of LH in regulating HSC function and offer a new therapeutic approach for hematopoietic regeneration after hematopoietic injury."
https://openalex.org/W2784208000,"The capacity of Acinetobacter baumannii to persist and cause infections depends on its interaction with abiotic and biotic surfaces, including those found on medical devices and host mucosal surfaces. However, the extracellular stimuli affecting these interactions are poorly understood. Based on our previous observations, we hypothesized that mucin, a glycoprotein secreted by lung epithelial cells, particularly during respiratory infections, significantly alters A. baumannii's physiology and its interaction with the surrounding environment. Biofilm, virulence and growth assays showed that mucin enhances the interaction of A. baumannii ATCC 19606T with abiotic and biotic surfaces and its cytolytic activity against epithelial cells while serving as a nutrient source. The global effect of mucin on the physiology and virulence of this pathogen is supported by RNA-Seq data showing that its presence in a low nutrient medium results in the differential transcription of 427 predicted protein-coding genes. The reduced expression of ion acquisition genes and the increased transcription of genes coding for energy production together with the detection of mucin degradation indicate that this host glycoprotein is a nutrient source. The increased expression of genes coding for adherence and biofilm biogenesis on abiotic and biotic surfaces, the degradation of phenylacetic acid and the production of an active type VI secretion system further supports the role mucin plays in virulence. Taken together, our observations indicate that A. baumannii recognizes mucin as an environmental signal, which triggers a response cascade that allows this pathogen to acquire critical nutrients and promotes host-pathogen interactions that play a role in the pathogenesis of bacterial infections."
https://openalex.org/W2772263299,"A combination of biochemical and structural techniques allows the characterization of a novel docking domain in polyketide synthases, which is structurally disordered and facilitates association of subunits at ketosynthase–dehydratase junctions. Modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) produce numerous structurally complex natural products that have diverse applications in medicine and agriculture. PKSs typically consist of several multienzyme subunits that utilize structurally defined docking domains (DDs) at their N and C termini to ensure correct assembly into functional multiprotein complexes. Here we report a fundamentally different mechanism for subunit assembly in trans-acyltransferase (trans-AT) modular PKSs at the junction between ketosynthase (KS) and dehydratase (DH) domains. This mechanism involves direct interaction of a largely unstructured docking domain (DD) at the C terminus of the KS with the surface of the downstream DH. Acyl transfer assays and mechanism-based crosslinking established that the DD is required for the KS to communicate with the acyl carrier protein appended to the DH. Two distinct regions for binding of the DD to the DH were identified using NMR spectroscopy, carbene footprinting, and mutagenesis, providing a foundation for future elucidation of the molecular basis for interaction specificity."

Adapted cells had higher survival rates under desiccation than non-adapted cells. Transcript levels and patterns of general stress-related genes increased immediately after the combined-stress adaptation treatment, and remained unaltered or repressed during the desiccation challenge. However, there were differences between strains in the transcription patterns that were in agreement with a better performance of adapted cells of PM411 than TC92 in plant surfaces under low RH environmental conditions. The combined-stress adaptation treatment increased the survival of PM411 cells consistently in different plant hosts in the greenhouse and under field conditions.

In this study, 10 candidate reference genes-ACT (Actin), E2 (Ubiquitin conjugating enzyme 2), TUBα (Alpha-tubulin), TUBβ6 (Beta-tubulin 6), GAPDH (Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase), EF-1α (Elongation factor 1-alpha), SAMDC (S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase), PKABA1 (Gene for protein kinase HvPKABA1), PGK (Phosphoglycerate kinase), and HSP90 (Heat shock protein 90)-were selected from the NCBI gene database of barley. Following qRT-PCR amplifications of all candidate reference genes in Tibetan hulless barley seedlings under various stressed conditions, the stabilities of these candidates were analyzed by three individual software packages including geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper. The results demonstrated that TUBβ6, E2, TUBα, and HSP90 were generally the most suitable sets under all tested conditions; similarly, TUBα and HSP90 showed peak stability under salt stress, TUBα and EF-1α were the most suitable reference genes under cold stress, and ACT and E2 were the most stable under drought stress. Finally, a known circadian gene CCA1 was used to verify the service ability of chosen reference genes. The results confirmed that all recommended reference genes by the three software were suitable for gene expression analysis under tested stress conditions by the qRT-PCR method."

It has recently been reported that LFA performance can be improved by using magnetic reporter particles and an external magnetic field applied at the test line. The mechanism of sensitivity/performance enhancement was suggested to be concentration/retardation of reporter particles at the test line. Here we demonstrate an additional mechanism of particle relocation where reporter particles from the lower depths of the translucent LFA strip relocate to more-visible locations nearer to the top surface, producing a more visible signal. With a magnetic field we observed an improvement in sensitivity of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) detection from 1.25 ng/mL to 0.31 ng/mL. We also observed an increase of the color intensity per particle in test lines when the magnetic field was present."
https://openalex.org/W2781691843,"Objective To determine the impact of the fixed and adaptive beamforming technology of the new MED-EL SONNET cochlear implant audio processor on speech perception in noise. Methods The study cohort comprises 18 postlingually deafened adult cochlear implant recipients with at least six months of experience. Speech reception thresholds were measured with the Oldenburg Sentence Test in continuous, speech-shaped noise. Target sentences were presented in front of the listener, with noise sources placed at -135° and 135°, respectively. Outcome measures were the differences in speech reception threshold using omnidirectional, fixed and adaptive beamformer microphone settings. Results The use of directional microphones significantly improved speech reception thresholds: fixed beamformer vs. omnidirectional: 4.3 dB (95%-CI [3.1; 5.5]), p<0.0001; adaptive beamformer vs. omnidirectional: 6.1 dB (95%-CI [4.9; 7.3]), p<0.0001; and adaptive beamformer vs. fixed beamformer: 1.8 dB (95%-CI [0.7; 3.0]), p = 0.001. Conclusion This study confirms the previously reported improvements in speech perception in noise of the fixed beamformer microphone setting and is the first to report significant improvements in speech perception in noise when applying the adaptive beamformer microphone settings of the SONNET audio processor. Cochlear implant users may be able to benefit from improved hearing performance especially in difficult listening situations."

Though many mutants improving the endospermic protein quality were discovered, they could not be successfully deployed. Recently discovered opaque16 (o16)mutant enhances the lysine and tryptophan content in maize endosperm. In the present study, the influence of o16 on the endosperm modification was analyzed in four F2 populations, two each segregating for o16 allele alone and in combination with o2. The recessive o16o16 seed endosperm was found to be vitreousphenotypically similar to wild-O16O16. The mutant did not influence the degree of kernel opaqueness in o2o2 genetic background as opaqueness in o2o2/O16O16 and o2o2/o16o16 was similar. Grain hardness of o16o16 was comparable with the normal and QPM maize. The pattern of microscopic organization of proteinaceous matrix and starch granules, and zein profiling of the storage protein in o16o16 were found to be similar with normal maize endosperm, but distinct from the o2o2-soft genotype. The pattern in o2o2/o16o16 was unique and different from o2o2 and o16o16 as well. Here we demonstrated the effects of o16 on physico-biochemical characteristics of endosperm and report of o16 possessing negligible influence on kernel modification and hardness, which holds a great significance in maize quality breeding programme."

Health promoting lifestyle profiles have been developed, but measures of health protective behavior are still lacking. This study sought to develop a health protecting behavior scale. Methods An initial item pool for the Health Protective Behavior Scale (HPBS) was generated based on read and referred literature and a single-item open-ended survey. An expert group screened this initial item pool using an item-level content validity index. Pilot testing was conducted. The degree of variation, the response rate, the item-total correlation coefficient, and the factor loading in factor analysis and item analysis were used to screen items using data of pilot testing. 454 subjects were recruited evaluate the psychometric properties of the HPBS. Analyses included internal consistency, test-retest reliability, factor analysis, parallel analysis, correlation analysis and criterion validity analysis. Results The final iteration of the HPBS was developed with 32 items and five dimensions: interpersonal support, general behavior, self-knowledge, nutrition behavior and health care. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient, and test-retest reliability were 0.89 and 0.89 respectively. Correlation coefficients of the five dimensions ranged from 0.28 to 0.55. The Spearman correlation coefficient between the total scores on the WHOQOL-BREF and on the HPBS was 0.34. Conclusions HPBS has sufficient validity and reliability to measure health protective behaviors in adults."
https://openalex.org/W2782094194,"The heme-containing enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) is critical for optimal antimicrobial activity of human neutrophils. We recently discovered that the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus expresses a novel immune evasion protein, called SPIN, that binds tightly to MPO, inhibits MPO activity, and contributes to bacterial survival following phagocytosis. A co-crystal structure of SPIN bound to MPO suggested that SPIN blocks substrate access to the catalytic heme by inserting an N-terminal β-hairpin into the MPO active-site channel. Here, we describe a series of experiments that more completely define the structure/function relationships of SPIN. Whereas the SPIN N terminus adopts a β-hairpin confirmation upon binding to MPO, the solution NMR studies presented here are consistent with this region of SPIN being dynamically structured in the unbound state. Curiously, whereas the N-terminal β-hairpin of SPIN accounts for ∼55% of the buried surface area in the SPIN-MPO complex, its deletion did not significantly change the affinity of SPIN for MPO but did eliminate the ability of SPIN to inhibit MPO. The flexible nature of the SPIN N terminus rendered it susceptible to proteolytic degradation by a series of chymotrypsin-like proteases found within neutrophil granules, thereby abrogating SPIN activity. Degradation of SPIN was prevented by the S. aureus immune evasion protein Eap, which acts as a selective inhibitor of neutrophil serine proteases. Together, these studies provide insight into MPO inhibition by SPIN and suggest possible functional synergy between two distinct classes of S. aureus immune evasion proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2783073093,"Postoperative ileus (POI) is an important factor prolonging the length of hospital stay following colorectal surgery. We retrospectively explored whether there is a clinically relevant association between intraoperative hypothermia and POI in patients who underwent laparoscopic colorectal surgery for malignancy within the setting of an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) program between April 2016 and January 2017 at our institution. In total, 637 patients were analyzed, of whom 122 (19.2%) developed clinically and radiologically diagnosed POI. Overall, 530 (83.2%) patients experienced intraoperative hypothermia. Although the mean lowest core temperature was lower in patients with POI than those without POI (35.3 ± 0.5°C vs. 35.5 ± 0.5°C, P = 0.004), the independence of intraoperative hypothermia was not confirmed based on multivariate logistic regression analysis. In addition to three variables (high age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index score, long duration of surgery, high maximum pain score during the first 3 days postoperatively), cumulative dose of rescue opioids used during the first 3 days postoperatively was identified as an independent risk factor of POI (odds ratio = 1.027 for each 1-morphine equivalent [mg] increase, 95% confidence interval = 1.014–1.040, P <0.001). Patients with hypothermia showed significant delays in both progression to a soft diet and discharge from hospital. In conclusion, intraoperative hypothermia was not independently associated with POI within an ERAS pathway, in which items other than thermal measures might offset its negative impact on POI. However, as it was associated with delayed discharge from the hospital, intraoperative maintenance of normothermia is still needed."
https://openalex.org/W2783966671,"Background Some studies have listed motions that may cause Osgood-Schlatter disease, but none have quantitatively assessed the load on the tibial tubercle by such motions. Purposes To quantitatively identify the load on the tibial tubercle through a biomechanical approach using various motions that may cause Osgood-Schlatter disease, and to compare the load between different motions. Methods Eight healthy male subjects were included. They conducted 4 types of kicks with a soccer ball, 2 types of runs, 2 types of squats, 2 types of jump landings, 2 types of stops, 1 type of turn, and 1 type of cutting motion. The angular impulse was calculated for knee extension moments ≥1.0 Nm/kg, ≥1.5 Nm/kg, ≥2.0 Nm/kg, and ≥2.5 Nm/kg. After analysis of variance, the post-hoc test was used to perform pairwise comparisons between all groups. Results/Conclusions The motion with the highest mean angular impulse of knee extension moment ≥1.0 Nm/kg was the single-leg landing after a jump, and that with the second highest mean was the cutting motion. At ≥1.5 Nm/kg, ≥2.0 Nm/kg, and ≥2.5 Nm/kg, the cutting motion was the highest, followed by the jump with a single-leg landing. They have a large load, and are associated with a higher risk of developing Osgood-Schlatter disease. The mean angular impulse of the 2 types of runs was small at all the indicators. Clinical relevance Motions with a high risk of developing Osgood-Schlatter disease and low-risk motions can be assessed in further detail if future studies can quantify the load and number of repetitions that may cause Osgood-Schlatter disease while considering age and the development stage. Scheduled training regimens that balance load on the tibial tubercle with low-load motions after a training day of many load-intensive motions may prevent athletes from developing Osgood-Schlatter disease and increase their participation in sports."

The fast component of the delayed rectifier potassium currents responsible for repolarization of the cardiac action potential, Ikr, is encoded by the human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) channel. Here, we exposed hERG1a channel–expressing HEK293T cells to lamiNAr shear stress (LSS) and observed that this mechanical stress increased the whole-cell current by 30–40%. LSS shifted the voltage dependence of steady-state activation of the hERG channel to the hyperpolarizing direction, accelerated the time course of activation and recovery from iNActivation, slowed down deactivation, and shifted the steady-state iNActivation to the positive direction, all of which favored the hERG open state. In contrast, the time course of iNActivation was faster, favoring the closed state. Using specific inhibitors of focal adhesion kiNAse, a regulator of mechano-transduction via the integrin pathway, we also found that the LSS-induced modulation of the whole-cell current depended on the integrin pathway. The hERG1b channel variant, which lacks the Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain, and long QT syndrome–associated variants having point mutations in the PAS domain were uNAffected by LSS, suggesting that the PAS domain in hERG1a channel may be involved in sensing mechanical shear stress.

We conclude that a mechano-electric feedback pathway modulates hERG channel activity through the integrin pathway, indicating that mechanical forces in the heart influence its electrical activity. The beating of the heart is initiated by an elaborate and well-tuned electrical system that generates the cardiac action potential (AP). 2The abbreviations used are: APaction potentialLSSlaminar shear stressFAKfocal adhesion kinasePASPer-Arnt-SimAPDaction potential durationpFpicofaradVGCvoltage-gated channelECMextracellular matrixCNBhcyclic nucleotide-binding homology domainhERGhuman ether-a-go-go related gene. The shape and duration of the cardiac AP is held within close tolerances as small variations can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and even catastrophic heart failure. The firing of the AP, in turn, results in contractions of the musculature of the heart and hence blood flow through the body. The effect of mechanical forces at work during the heart beat on the electrical system of the heart have not, surprisingly, been investigated in detail so far. Regulation of ion channel activity plays a central role in controlling heart rate, rhythm, and contractility responses to cardiovascular demands. Dynamic beat to beat regulation of ion channels in the context of hemodynamic shear forces is still a gray area.

Voltage-gated ion channels are abundant in the heart, playing pivotal roles in the proper shaping of the cardiac action potential. Several neuronal voltage-gated potassium channels have recently been shown to be mechanosensitive (1Schmidt D. del Mármol J. MacKinnon R. Mechanistic basis for low threshold mechanosensitivity in voltage-dependent K+ channels.Proc. NAtl. Acad. Sci.

Voltage-gated cardiac channels (cardiac VGCs) share the same architecture as neuronal VGCs, raising the possibility that they are also mechanosensitive (2Isenberg G. Kazanski V. Kondratev D.

The ventricles lack specialist stretch-activated channels, i.e. channels that are relatively insensitive to other stimuli but mediate cation currents in response to stretch (3Morris C.E.

The myocardium is continuously exposed to a variety of forces over each contraction and must therefore adapt to the associated mechanical stresses. One such major force is the shear stress that arises from blood flow and the sliding of myocardial layers against each other with each heart beat (5Boycott H.E. Barbier C.S. Eichel C.A. Costa K.D.

However, it is unclear as to whether mechanosensitivity is an integral part of cardiac voltage-gated channel function and, if so, how gating transitions are modified under shear stress. The human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) encodes a K+ channel that is responsible for the IKr current that contributes to the falling phase of the cardiac action potential. hERG channels, unlike other voltage-gated potassium channels, have a unique inactivation mechanism that limits potassium efflux during depolarization but rebounds during repolarization, thereby facilitating a significant outward K+ tail current (8Trudeau M.C.

We have expressed hERG channels in HEK293T cells and investigated the response of whole-cell currents to shear stress, reproduced in vitro by laminar flow in a patch-clamp recording chamber. Laminar shear stress is correlated with an increase in whole-cell currents together with shifts of the V1/2 of activation in the hyperpolarizing direction, the V1/2 of inactivation toward depolarizing potentials, acceleration of the activation kinetics, decrease in deactivation rates, and increase in the rate of recovery from inactivation. All of these changes favor the open state. Conversely, shear stress also increased the rate of inactivation favoring a non-conducting state. Shear effects were saturable and reversible. β1 integrins are highly expressed in HEK293T cells (22Cherubini A. Hofmann G. Pillozzi S. Guasti L. Crociani O. Cilia E. Di Stefano P. Degani S. Balzi M. Olivotto M. Wanke E. Becchetti A. Defilippi P. Wymore R. Arcangeli A. Human ether-a-go-go-related gene 1 channels are physically linked to β1 integrins and modulate adhesion-dependent sigNAling.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16 (15800067): 2972-298310.1091/mbc.E04-10-0940Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and our data suggest that mechano-transduction occurs via the integrin pathway. The cytoskeleton participates in the shear response. hERG1b, a splice variant lacking the PAS domain, as well as long QT mutants harboring point mutations in the PAS domain were unresponsive to shear stress suggesting a possible role of the PAS domain in mechanosensation. The effect of laminar shear stress (LSS) on hERG-transfected HEK293T cells was investigated using the whole-cell patch-clamp configuration in the voltage-clamp mode. Voltage was stepped to a series of potentials from a holding potential of −80 mV and then taken to a test potential of −60 mV. The current just prior to the −60-mV step is taken as the step current, whereas that immediately after the step is the tail current. As shown in Fig. 1B, increased flow rate caused enhancement in tail current recorded at −60 mV from a step potential of 0 mV. Data are presented as percentage change from the value of the parameter at a baseline flow rate of 1 ml/min, which was taken as pre-shear. We present all data as mean ± S.D. Flow rates between 1 and 15 ml/min were tested, and tail current at −60 mV was found to be significantly greater under shear than pre-shear at all flow rates above 1 ml/min. The data suggest two states for the whole-cell current and fit well to a Boltzmann function with a midpoint at 5.2 ± 0.10 ml/min (n = 5). Currents at flow rates of 7, 10, and 15 ml/min were essentially indistinguishable, indicating that shear-induced changes in hERG physiology had saturated by 7 ml/min (Fig. 1C). All further studies compared recordings at flow rates of 1 and 10 ml/min. The corresponding shear stress to which the cells in the recording chamber were exposed is not precisely known. However, assuming a linear velocity variation in the direction orthogonal to flow, the shear stress is estimated to be 11.3 dyn/cm2 at 10 ml/min (28Barakat A.I. Leaver E.V. Pappone P.A. Davies P.F. A flow-activated chloride-selective membrane current in vascular endothelial cells.Circ. Res. 1999; 85 (10532950): 820-82810.1161/01.RES.85.9.820Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In addition to enhancement of tail current, the step current also increased on application of shear stress (Fig. 1, A and C). An increase of around 27% from 42.5 ± 10.02 to 54 ± 16.48 pA/pF (n = 16, p < 0.001, paired t test) was observed for a step to 0 mV. Tail currents in the same experiment increased from 51.2 ± 13.80 pA/pF at 1 ml/min flow to 66.8 ± 16.56 pA/pF (n = 20, p < 0.001) at 10 ml/min, an increase of 30.4%. Around 88% of the cells recorded showed an increase in current in both step and tail current on being subjected to shear stress. However, some cells displayed an increase in either step or tail current but not both. The reversibility of the phenomenon was tested at −60 mV by switching flow rates between 1 and 10 ml/min (Fig. 1D). After acquiring a baseline at 1 ml/min, flow was increased to 10 ml/min for 390 s, then allowed to recover at 1 ml/min for 360 s before returning to 10 ml/min. Tail currents increased by the first measured time point, which was at 20 s after switching to 10 ml/min on both occasions, and they continued to increase with a time constant of 91.4 s (fit is shown with a smooth black line, Fig. 1D). Saturation of the response was seen in about 300 s. Decay to baseline was slower, with a time constant of 154.8 s (fit is shown with a smooth black line, Fig. 1D). Recovery saturated at a value that was 13% higher than the original baseline. The second episode of high flow resulted in an increase of current to a value that was 95% of the first cycle (n = 6). Another mechanical stress is membrane stretching by cell swelling. We recorded hERG1a potassium currents in whole-cell mode first under iso-osmotic conditions and then under hypo-osmotic conditions for a period of 2.5 min to induce cell swelling at a constant flow rate of 1 ml/min (Fig. S4A). Osmotic strength was modified using sorbitol to maintain the ionic composition. On switching from iso-osmotic to hypo-osmotic solutions, the step currents increased from 56.22 ± 12.40 to 69.16 ± 13.14 pA/pF at 0 mV (an increase of 23.2%), and tail currents increased from 80.66 ± 20.33 to 97.97 ± 17.17 pA/pF at −60 mV (an increase of 21.4%). Statistical comparison was done using paired t test, n = 6, p = 0.004, and p = 0.03 for step and tail currents, respectively. Cell capacitance did not change significantly (p > 0.05, n = 6, paired t test) between iso-osmotic (15.18 ± 4.87 pF) and hypo-osmotic conditions (14.54 ± 4.48 pF), which renders the fusion of channel containing vesicles with the plasma membrane an unlikely source of the increased current (Fig. S4B). The initial survey of sensitivity to shear stress was restricted to a 0-mV step (Fig. 2, A–C). Analysis of the full range of step potentials at 10 ml/min reveals that the step current is enhanced in the presence of shear at all potentials below +10 mV (Fig. 2C). Additionally, when the I–V plots are normalized, a shift of 10 mV to hyperpolarizing potentials can be observed in the presence of shear (Fig. 2C, inset). This means that normalized current is higher under shear than in its absence at any potential below the peak potential of +10 mV. The combination of voltage shift and increased amplitude result in the two curves being indistinguishable above +10 mV (Fig. 2C). The tail current seen immediately after stepping to the test potential of −60 mV is proportional to the total number of channels that had opened during the step pulse. The voltage dependence of channel opening could be fit with a Boltzmann function with a mid-point (V1/2) at 0.6 ± 0.23 mV at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and at −8.8 ± 0.39 mV at 10 ml/min, a hyperpolarizing shift of −9.4 mV (Fig. 2D, n = 7). A mid-point (V1/2) of −2.4 ± 0.46 was observed after switching back to 1 ml/min flow rate, which is close to the pre-shear value (Fig. 2D, dashed lines, n = 7). No change in reversal potential was seen (Fig. 3A). The tail current is proportional to the number of channels open at the end of the step pulse. Decay of the tail current is due to the closing of these channels, i.e. deactivation. The decay of the tail current could be fit to two exponentials. At −60 and −100 mV, both the deactivation time constants (τdeact) (Fig. 3, B and C) increased with shear 161.3 ± 38.2 to 173 ± 38.07 ms (p < 0.0001, n = 5, paired t test) and 63 ± 18.24 to 92 ± 39.23 ms (p = 0.01, n = 5, paired t test), respectively, for the fast component, which includes 90% of the deactivation, and 1040 ± 161 to 1137 ± 57.92 ms (p = 0.01, n = 5, paired t test) and 343.8 ± 93.39 to 558.9 ± 168.1 ms (p = 0.02, n = 5, paired t test), respectively, for the slow component. Hence the outward current through hERG lasts longer under shear. Examination of kinetic transitions provides more information regarding the influence of shear stress on hERG current activation. Fig. 4A illustrates the envelope of tails protocol used to measure the activation time constant uncontaminated by the faster inactivation process (29Sale H. Wang J. O'Hara T.J. Tester D.J.

Res. 2008; 103 (18776039): e81-e9510.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.185249Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Because the inactivation of HERG channels is released at a faster rate than the channels deactivate (30Smith P.L. Baukrowitz T. Yellen G. The inward rectification mechanism of the HERG cardiac potassium channel.NAture. 1996; 379 (8587608): 833-83610.1038/379833a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), this is a more specific measure of activation. The tail current at −60 mV, which is proportional to the number of channels having transitioned from closed to open during the preceding step to 0 mV, is plotted as a function of time in Fig. 4B. Peak tail current values at different time points were fit with a single exponential function as shown. The analysis reveals a t½ of 279.9 ± 5.9 ms at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and t½ of 155.5 ± 17 ms under LSS (Fig. 4C), indicating that transitions from the closed to the open state almost double under shear (p < 0.0001, n = 8, paired t test). hERG1b is a splice variant that lacks the PAS domain found in the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail of hERG1a. hERG1b also has a unique N-terminal cap comprising 20 amino acid residues (31Jones D.K.

It has been reported earlier that hERG1b fails to form functional channels in HEK293T (29Sale H. Wang J. O'Hara T.J. Tester D.J. Phartiyal P. He J.-Q. Rudy Y. Ackerman M.J. Robertson G.A.

However, with 2 μg of Dna we were able to get measurable currents (step current density, 36.2 ± 11.59 pA/pF, and tail current density: 11.4 ± 4.39 6 pA/pF). As shown in Fig. 5A and Fig. S1A, laminar shear stress had no effect on hERG1b current activation (p > 0.05, n = 7, paired t test). Because hERG1b lacks the PAS domain and is resistant to shear stress, we tested the role of the PAS domain in the shear response. The PAS domain alone, expressed as an independent polypeptide, interacts directly with hERG1a/1b heteromeric channels, and it has been suggested that it occupies sites left vacant by hERG1b subunits (33GustiNA A.S.

Expressing the PAS domain together with hERG1b resulted in a large increase in currents (Fig. S1B). As shown in Fig. 5B, increasing flow rates to 10 ml/min had little effect in step currents in this system but did increase the tail currents by around 16% (73.1 ± 26.04 to 87.2 ± 29.43 pA/pF, p = 0.01, n = 5, paired t test). The PAS domain thus restored some degree of mechanosensitivity.

B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, which can trigger UPR, induces gammaherpesvirus lytic replication and serves as a physiological mechanism for gammaherpesvirus reactivation in vivo. However, how the UPR regulates BCR-mediated gammaherpesvirus infection is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the ER stressors tunicamycin and thapsigargin inhibit BCR-mediated murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) lytic replication by inducing expression of the UPR mediator Bip and blocking activation of Akt, ERK, and JNK. Both Bip and the downstream transcription factor ATF4 inhibited BCR-mediated MHV68 lytic gene expression, whereas UPR-induced C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) was required for and promoted BCR-mediated MHV68 lytic replication by suppressing upstream Bip and ATF4 expression. Bip knockout was sufficient to rescue BCR-mediated MHV68 lytic gene expression in CHOP knockout cells, and this rescue was blocked by ectopic ATF4 expression. Furthermore, ATF4 directly inhibited promoter activity of the MHV68 lytic switch transactivator RTA. Altogether, we show that ER stress–induced CHOP inhibits Bip and ATF4 expression and that ATF4, in turn, plays a critical role in CHOP-mediated regulation of BCR-controlled MHV68 lytic replication.

https://openalex.org/W2783774172,"In this study, the differences in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and abscisic acid (ABA) accumulation in senescing leaves were investigated by early-senescence-leaf (esl) mutant and its wild type, to clarify the relationship among ABA levels, ROS generation, and NADPH oxidase (Nox) in senescing leaves of rice (Oryza sativa). The temporal expression levels of OsNox isoforms in senescing leaves and their expression patterns in response to ABA treatment were determined through quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Results showed that the flag leaf of the esl mutant generated more O2- concentrations and accumulated higher ABA levels than the wild-type cultivar did in the grain-filling stage. Exogenous ABA treatment induced O2- generation; however, it was depressed by diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI) pretreatment in the detached leaf segments. This finding suggested the involvement of NADPH oxidase in ABA-induced O2- generation. The esl mutant exhibited significantly higher expression of OsNox2, OsNox5, OsNox6, and OsNox7 in the initial of grain-filling stage, followed by sharply decrease. The transcriptional levels of OsNox1, OsNox3, and OsFR07 in the flag leaf of the esl mutant were significantly lower than those in the wild-type cultivar. The expression levels of OsNox2, OsNox5, OsNox6, and OsNox7 were significantly enhanced by exogenous ABA treatments. The enhanced expression levels of OsNox2 and OsNox6 were dependent on the duration of ABA treatment. The inducible expression levels of OsNox5 and OsNox7 were dependent on ABA concentrations. By contrast, exogenous ABA treatment severely repressed the transcripts of OsNox1, OsNox3, and OsFR07 in the detached leaf segments. Therefore, OsNox2, OsNox5, OsNox6, and OsNox7 were probably involved in the ABA-induced O2- generation in the initial stage of leaf senescence. Subsequently, other oxidases activated in deteriorating cells were associated with ROS generation and accumulation in the senescing leaves of the esl mutant. Conversely, OsNox1, OsNox3, and OsFR07 were not associated with ABA-induced O2- generation during leaf senescence."

Subtyping was performed through REGA v3.0 and the relationship of our CRF19_cpx sequences, among themselves and regarding other reference sequences from the same variant, was defined by phylogenetic analysis. We used PhyML program to perform a reconstruction of the phylogeny by Maximum Likelihood method as well as further confirmation of the transmission clusters by Bayesian inference. Additionally, we collected demographic, clinical and immunovirological data.Between 2011 and 2016, we detected 57 treatment-naïve patients with the CRF19_cpx variant. Of these, 55 conformed a very well-defined transmission cluster, phylogenetically close to CRF19_cpx sequences from the United Kingdom. The origin of this subtype in Malaga was dated between 2007 and 2010. Over 50% of the patients presented the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor G190A resistance mutation.

https://openalex.org/W2783969507,"Equine pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) is characterized by hyperplasia of the pars intermedia (PI) melanotrophs of the pituitary gland (PG), and increased production of proopiomelanocortin (POMC). POMC is cleaved by prohormone convertase 1 (PC1) to produce adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and further processing of ACTH by PC2 to produce alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) and corticotropin-like intermediate peptide (CLIP). High plasma ACTH concentrations in horses with PPID might be related to reduced conversion of ACTH to α-MSH by PCs. The hypothesis of this study was that PC1 and PC2 expression in the pituitary gland are altered in PPID, resulting in an abnormal relative abundance of POMC derived proteins. The objectives of this study were to identify the partial sequences of equine POMC, PC1, and PC2 mRNAs; and to determine whether the expression of POMC, PC1, and PC2 mRNAs in whole pituitary extracts, and POMC-protein in the cavernous sinus blood of horses are altered in PPID. We confirmed (RT-PCR and sequencing) that the partial sequences obtained match the corresponding regions of predicted equine POMC, PC1 and PC2 sequences. The expression (quantification by RT-qPCR) of POMC, PC1 and PC2 mRNAs were found upregulated in the pituitary of horses with PPID. Plasma (measured using RIA/ELISA) ACTH and α-MSH were elevated in PPID horses. These results indicate distinct differences in gene and protein expression of POMC and its intermediates, and processing enzymes in PPID. It provides evidence to support the notion that local, pituitary-specific inadequacies in prohormone processing likely contribute to equine PPID."

The plasma focus has been widely investigated as a radiation source, including as ion-beams, electron-beams and as a source of x-ray and neutron production, providing considerable scope for use in a variety of technological situations. Thus said, the nature of the radiation emission depends on the dynamics of the plasma pinch. In this study of the characteristics of deuteron-beam emission, in terms of energy, fluence and angular distribution were analyzed. The 2.7 kJ plasma focus discharge has been made to operate at a pressure of less than 1 mbar rather than at its more conventional operating pressure of a few mbar. Faraday cup were used to determine deuteron-beam energy and deuteron-beam fluence per shot while CR-39 solid-state nuclear track detectors were employed in studying the angular distribution of deuteron emission. Beam energy and deuteron-beam fluence per shot have been found to be pressure dependent. The largest value of average deuteron energy measured for present conditions was found to be (52 ± 7) keV, while the deuteron-beam fluence per shot was of the order of 1015 ions/m2 when operated at a pressure of 0.2 mbar.

https://openalex.org/W2784263842,"Functional linear regression models are effectively used in gene-based association analysis of complex traits. These models combine information about individual genetic variants, taking into account their positions and reducing the influence of noise and/or observation errors. To increase the power of methods, where several differently informative components are combined, weights are introduced to give the advantage to more informative components. Allele-specific weights have been introduced to collapsing and kernel-based approaches to gene-based association analysis. Here we have for the first time introduced weights to functional linear regression models adapted for both independent and family samples. Using data simulated on the basis of GAW17 genotypes and weights defined by allele frequencies via the beta distribution, we demonstrated that type I errors correspond to declared values and that increasing the weights of causal variants allows the power of functional linear models to be increased. We applied the new method to real data on blood pressure from the ORCADES sample. Five of the six known genes with P < 0.1 in at least one analysis had lower P values with weighted models. Moreover, we found an association between diastolic blood pressure and the VMP1 gene (P = 8.18×10-6), when we used a weighted functional model. For this gene, the unweighted functional and weighted kernel-based models had P = 0.004 and 0.006, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2784313058,"To inform a community-based ocean zoning initiative, we conducted an intensive ecological assessment of the marine ecosystems of Barbuda, West Indies. We conducted 116 fish and 108 benthic surveys around the island, and measured the abundance and size structure of lobsters and conch at 52 and 35 sites, respectively. We found that both coral cover and fish biomass were similar to or lower than levels observed across the greater Caribbean; live coral cover and abundance of fishery target species, such as large snappers and groupers, was generally low. However, Barbuda lacks many of the high-relief forereef areas where similar work has been conducted in other Caribbean locations. The distribution of lobsters was patchy, making it difficult to quantify density at the island scale. However, the maximum size of lobsters was generally larger than in other locations in the Caribbean and similar to the maximum size reported 40 years ago. While the lobster population has clearly been heavily exploited, our data suggest that it is not as overexploited as in much of the rest of the Caribbean. Surveys of Barbuda's Codrington Lagoon revealed many juvenile lobsters, but none of legal size (95 mm carapace length), suggesting that the lagoon functions primarily as nursery habitat. Conch abundance and size on Barbuda were similar to that of other Caribbean islands. Our data suggest that many of the regional threats observed on other Caribbean islands are present on Barbuda, but some resources-particularly lobster and conch-may be less overexploited than on other Caribbean islands. Local management has the potential to provide sustainability for at least some of the island's marine resources. We show that a rapid, thorough ecological assessment can reveal clear conservation opportunities and facilitate rapid conservation action by providing the foundation for a community-driven policymaking process at the island scale."
https://openalex.org/W2783158731,"The present study explored the sensitivity towards bimanual end-state comfort in a task that required anticipating different final grips. Participants simultaneously reached and grasped two objects with either a whole-hand grip (WHG) or a precision grip (PG), and placed them at two target locations by transporting them either over or under an obstacle. The transport path was varied such that it could be either congruent (i.e., both objects over or under) or incongruent (i.e., one object over and the other object under). In the congruent conditions, participants satisfied bimanual end-state comfort (and identical initial grips) on the majority of trials. That is, participants adopted a PG for either hand when the objects were transported over the obstacle and a WHG for either hand when the objects were transported under the obstacle. In contrast, in the incongruent conditions, bimanual end-state comfort was significantly reduced, indicating the presence of intermanual inference. The results indicate that goal-related planning constraints (i.e., bimanual end-state comfort) do not strictly take precedence over means-related constraints (i.e., identical initial grips) if this requires anticipating different final grips. Thus, bimanual end-state comfort per se does not provide a predominant constraint in action selection, by which sensorimotor interference can be reduced. In line with the proposal that bimanual grip planning relies on a flexible constraint hierarchy, a simple formal model that considers bimanual grip posture planning as a tradeoff between goal-related and means-related planning processes can explain our results reasonably well."

ShinyGPA allows users to effectively investigate genetic relationships among phenotypes using a flexible low-dimensional visualization and an intuitive user interface. In addition, ShinyGPA provides joint association mapping functionality that can facilitate biological understanding of the pleiotropic architecture. We analyzed GWAS summary statistics for 12 phenotypes using ShinyGPA and obtained visualization results and joint association mapping results that are well supported by the literature. The visualization produced by ShinyGPA can also be used as a hypothesis generating tool for relationships between phenotypes, which might also be used to improve the design of future genetic studies. ShinyGPA is currently available at https://dongjunchung.github.io/GPA/."

Similarly, animal models of schizophrenia by these drugs are also induced after the critical period around postnatal week three. Based upon the development-dependent onsets of these psychotomimetic effects, by using a DNA microarray technique, we identified the WD repeat domain 3 (WDR3) and chitobiosyldiphosphodolichol beta-mannosyltransferase (ALG1) genes as novel candidates for schizophrenia-related molecules, whose mRNAs were up-regulated in the adult (postnatal week seven), but not in the infant (postnatal week one) rats by an indirect dopamine agonist, and phencyclidine, an antagonist of the NMDA receptor. WDR3 and other related proteins are the nuclear proteins presumably involved in various cellular activities, such as cell cycle progression, signal transduction, apoptosis, and gene regulation. ALG1 is presumed to be involved in the regulation of the protein N-glycosylation. To further elucidate the molecular pathophysiology of schizophrenia, we have evaluated the genetic association of WDR3 and ALG1 in schizophrenia. We examined 21 single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs; W1 (rs1812607)-W16 (rs6656360), A1 (rs8053916)-A10 (rs9673733)] from these genes using the Japanese case-control sample (1,808 schizophrenics and 2,170 matched controls). No significant genetic associations of these SNPs were identified. However, we detected a significant association of W4 (rs319471) in the female schizophrenics (allelic P = 0.003, genotypic P = 0.008). Based on a haplotype analysis, the observed haplotypes consisting of W4 (rs319471)-W5 (rs379058) also displayed a significant association in the female schizophrenics (P = 0.016). Even after correction for multiple testing, these associations remained significant. Our findings suggest that the WDR3 gene may likely be a sensitive factor in female patients with schizophrenia, and that modification of the WDR3 signaling pathway warrants further investigation as to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia."
