https://openalex.org/W2016080258,The human adenovirus E1B gene encodes a 55-kilodalton protein that inactivates the cellular tumor suppressor protein p53. Here it is shown that a mutant adenovirus that does not express this viral protein can replicate in and lyse p53-deficient human tumor cells but not cells with functional p53. Ectopic expression of the 55-kilodalton EIB protein in the latter cells rendered them sensitive to infection with the mutant virus. Injection of the mutant virus into p53-deficient human cervical carcinomas grown in nude mice caused a significant reduction in tumor size and caused complete regression of 60 percent of the tumors. These data raise the possibility that mutant adenoviruses can be used to treat certain human tumors.

The distribution of benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE) adducts along exons of the P53 gene in BPDE-treated HeLa cells and bronchial epithelial cells was mapped at nucleotide resolution. Strong and selective adduct formation occurred at guanine positions in codons 157, 248, and 273. These same positions are the major mutational hotspots in human lung cancers. Thus, targeted adduct formation rather than phenotypic selection appears to shape the P53 mutational spectrum in lung cancer. These results provide a direct etiological link between a defined chemical carcinogen and human cancer."

https://openalex.org/W1997173667,"When humans respond to sensory stimulation, their reaction times tend to be long and variable relative to neural transduction and transmission times. The neural processes responsible for the duration and variability of reaction times are not understood. Single-cell recordings in a motor area of the cerebral cortex in behaving rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were used to evaluate two alternative mathematical models of the processes that underlie reaction times. Movements were initiated if and only if the neural activity reached a specific and constant threshold activation level. Stochastic variability in the rate at which neural activity grew toward that threshold resulted in the distribution of reaction times. This finding elucidates a specific link between motor behavior and activation of neurons in the cerebral cortex."

https://openalex.org/W1967020365,"Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) can cross the intact vaginal epithelium to establish a systemic infection in macaques (mac). Using this SIVmac model, we found that subcutaneous progesterone implants, which could mimic hormonally based contraceptives, thinned the vaginal epithelium and enhanced SIV vaginal transmission 7.7-fold over that observed in macaques treated with placebo implants and exposed to SIV in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Progesterone treatment also increased the number of SIV DNA-positive cells in the vaginal lamina propria as detected by in situ polymerase chain reaction analysis. Moreover, plasma viral RNA was elevated for the first three months in macaques with progesterone implants, and three of the progesterone-treated macaques developed relatively rapid disease courses. This study shows that SIV genital infection and disease course are enhanced by subcutaneous implants containing progesterone when compared with the rate of vaginal transmission in the follicular phase."
https://openalex.org/W1557501694,"Macrophages have long been known to play a key role in the healing processes of tissues that regenerate after injury; however, the nature of their involvement in healing of the injured central nervous system (CNS) is still a subject of controversy. Here we show that the absence of regrowth in transected rat optic nerve (which, like all other CNS nerves in mammals, cannot regenerate after injury) can be overcome by local transplantation of macrophages preincubated ex vivo with segments of a nerve (e.g., sciatic nerve) that can regenerate after injury. The observed effect of the transplanted macrophages was found to be an outcome of their stimulated activity, as indicated by phagocytosis. Thus, macrophage phagocytic activity was stimulated by their preincubation with sciatic nerve segments but inhibited by their preincubation with optic nerve segments. We conclude that the inability of nerves of the mammalian CNS to regenerate is related to the failure of their macrophages recruited after injury to acquire growth-supportive activity. We attribute this failure to the presence of a CNS resident macrophage inhibitory activity, which may be the biochemical basis underlying the immune privilege of the CNS. The transplantation of suitably activated macrophages into injured nerves may overcome multiple malfunctioning aspects of the CNS response to trauma, and thus may be developed into a novel, practical, and multipotent therapy for CNS injuries."

https://openalex.org/W2088256755,"In mice, susceptibility to Leishmania major is associated with the early expansion of T helper 2 cells (TH2) cells, but nothing is known of the specificity of these cells. A previously identified antigen, Leishmania homolog of receptors for activated C kinase (LACK), was found to be the focus of this initial response. Mice made tolerant to LACK by the transgenic expression of the antigen in the thymus exhibited both a diminished TH2 response and a healing phenotype. Thus, T cells that are activated early and are reactive to a single antigen play a pivotal role in directing the immune response to the entire parasite."

https://openalex.org/W2075999855,"Plasma measurements made during the flyby of Io on 7 December 1995 with the Galileo spacecraft plasma analyzers reveal that the spacecraft unexpectedly passed directly through the ionosphere of Io. The ionosphere is identified by a dense plasma that is at rest with respect to Io. This plasma is cool relative to those encountered outside the ionosphere. The composition of the ionospheric plasmas includes O++, O+ and S++, S+, and SO2+ ions. The plasma conditions at Io appear to account for the decrease in the magnetic field, without the need to assume that Io has a magnetized interior."

https://openalex.org/W2001167026,The Escherichia coli DNA binding protein RuvA acts in concert with the helicase RuvB to drive branch migration of Holliday intermediates during recombination and DNA repair. The atomic structure of RuvA was determined at a resolution of 1.9 angstroms. Four monomers of RuvA are related by fourfold symmetry in a manner reminiscent of a four-petaled flower. The four DNA duplex arms of a Holliday junction can be modeled in a square planar configuration and docked into grooves on the concave surface of the protein around a central pin that may facilitate strand separation during the migration reaction. The model presented reveals how a RuvAB-junction complex may also accommodate the resolvase RuvC.
https://openalex.org/W2049693129,"The Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer performed spectral studies of Jupiter and the Galilean satellites during the June 1996 perijove pass of the Galileo spacecraft. Spectra for a 5-micrometer hot spot on Jupiter are consistent with the absence of a significant water cloud above 8 bars and with a depletion of water compared to that predicted for solar composition, corroborating results from the Galileo probe. Great Red Spot (GRS) spectral images show that parts of this feature extend upward to 240 millibars, although considerable altitude-dependent structure is found within it. A ring of dense clouds surrounds the GRS and is lower than it by 3 to 7 kilometers. Spectra of Callisto and Ganymede reveal a feature at 4. 25 micrometers, attributed to the presence of hydrated minerals or possibly carbon dioxide on their surfaces. Spectra of Europa's high latitudes imply that fine-grained water frost overlies larger grains. Several active volcanic regions were found on Io, with temperatures of 420 to 620 kelvin and projected areas of 5 to 70 square kilometers."

https://openalex.org/W2044486795,"The formation of a topoisomerase-quinolone-DNA ternary complex leads to cell death. We show here that an active strand breakage and reunion activity is required for formation of a norfloxacin-topoisomerase IV-DNA ternary complex that can arrest the progression of replication forks in vitro. Mutant topoisomerases containing either an active site mutation, a quinolone resistance-conferring mutation, or both, could all bind DNA as well as the wild-type, but unlike the wild-type, could not halt replication fork progression. The collision between the replication fork and the frozen topoisomerase converted the cleavable complex to a nonreversible form but did not generate a double-stranded break. Thus, the cytotoxicity of this class of topoisomerase inhibitors likely results from a two-step process: (i) conversion of the frozen topoisomerase-quinolone-DNA ternary complex to an unreversible form; and (ii) generation of a double-strand break by subsequent denaturation of the topoisomerase, perhaps by an aborted repair attempt.

https://openalex.org/W1955539178,"Cellular iron homeostasis is regulated by the cytoplasmic iron regulatory protein (IRP), which binds to iron-responsive elements (IRE) of mRNAs, modulating iron uptake and sequestration, respectively. When iron is scarce, IRP binds to IRE and coordinately increases the synthesis of transferrin receptor and decreases that of ferritin, thus providing the cell with readily available free iron. When iron is in excess, IRP does not bind and iron sequestration prevails over iron uptake. We have found that incubation of rat liver lysates with xanthine oxidase (XO), which generates superoxide (O2-.) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), caused a remarkable but reversible inhibition of IRP activity, as the formation of IRE-IRP decreased by 70-80% but returned to baseline values upon exposure to a reducing agent like 2-mercaptoethanol. IRP inhibition was prevented by separate or simultaneous addition of superoxide dismutase and catalase, showing that both O2-. and H2O2 were involved. By contrast, iron chelators and hydroxyl radical scavengers did not impede the inhibition of IRP, suggesting that O2-. and H2O2 acted independently of free iron sources. Ferritin enhanced IRP inhibition, but this process involved tightly bound iron centers that shunted reducing equivalents from XO and returned them to oxygen, thus increasing the formation of O2-. In agreement with the exclusive role of O2-. and H2O2, XO also inhibited recombinant human IRP in the absence of iron. These results demonstrate that O2-. and H2O2 can directly but reversibly down-regulate the RNA-binding activity of IRP, causing transient decrease of free iron that otherwise would convert them into more potent oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals or equally aggressive iron-peroxo complexes. This establishes a novel protective stratagem against oxidative injury under pathophysiologic conditions characterized by the excessive generation of O2-. and H2O2."

These beams can carry sufficient energy flux into Jupiter's atmosphere to produce a visible aurora at the footprint of the magnetic flux tube connecting Io to Jupiter. Composition measurements through the torus showed that the spatial distributions of protons, oxygen, and sulfur are different, with sulfur being the dominant energetic (> approximately 10 kiloelectron volts per nucleon) ion at closest approach."

https://openalex.org/W2061670244,"Signal transduction across cell membranes often involves interactions among identical receptor subunits, but the contribution of individual subunits is not well understood. The chemoreceptors of enteric bacteria mediate attractant responses by interrupting a phosphotransfer circuit initiated at receptor complexes with the protein kinase CheA. The aspartate receptor (Tar) is a homodimer, and oligomerized cytoplasmic domains stimulate CheA activity much more than monomers do in vitro. Intragenic complementation was used to show in Escherichia coli that heterodimers containing one full-length and one truncated Tar subunit mediated responses to aspartate in the presence of full-length Tar homodimers that could not bind aspartate. Thus, a Tar dimer containing only one cytoplasmic domain can initiate an attractant (inhibitory) signal, although it may not be able to stimulate kinase activity of CheA."
https://openalex.org/W1930560310,"Pressure overload on the heart is known to produce hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes and distinct changes in protein phenotype, including reduced expression of the gene for the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ATPase (SERCA2). In this study we have shown that the decrease in SERCA2 gene expression (normalized by poly(A)+ mRNA or 18 S rRNA) in rats with 8 wk of aortic constriction was prevented by treatment with etomoxir, an inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1. The reduction in steady-state mRNA levels for SR phospholamban (PLP) and Ca2+ release channel (CRC) in the pressure-overloaded animals was also prevented without any reduction in the extent of cardiac hypertrophy by treatment with etomoxir. Although no changes in mRNA levels for GAPDH were evident in rats with pressure overload, the expression of the α-skeletal actin was increased; this change was prevented by etomoxir. Similar beneficial effects of etomoxir treatment were also evident when the gene expression for SR SERCA2, PLP, and CRC in the hypertrophied heart was normalized with respect to mRNA for GAPDH. These results support the view that drugs such as etomoxir may increase the abundance of the mRNA for SR proteins in the hypertrophied heart and thus may prevent the transition of cardiac hypertrophy into heart failure.—Zarain-Herzberg, A., Rupp, H., Elimban, V., Dhalla, N.

https://openalex.org/W1973007142,"PA28 is a protein activator of the 20S proteasome. It has a native molecular weight of approximately 200,000 and is composed of six 28,000-dalton subunits arranged in a ring-shaped complex. Purified preparations of PA28 contain two polypeptides, α and β, which are about 50% identical in primary structure. It has been unclear whether native PA28 consists of two distinct homohexameric proteins or of a single protein containing both α and β subunits. To distinguish between these possibilities, we prepared antibodies that reacted specifically with either the α or β subunit and used these subunit-specific antibodies in two types of experiments designed to elucidate PA28 quaternary structure. In the first experiment, the α and β subunits were completely co-immunoprecipitated by each subunit-specific antibody, indicating that both subunits were part of a single protein complex. In the second experiment, PA28 was chemically cross-linked using bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate. When the cross-linked products were immunoblotted after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, indistinguishable patterns were obtained with each subunit-specific antibody. These results confirm that the α and β subunits were part of the same protein complex. The pattern of cross-linked products also provided insight as to the relative abundance and arrangement of the subunits within the PA28 complex and indicated that the ring-shaped PA28 hexamer may be composed of alternating α and β subunits with a stoichiometry of (αβ)3. PA28 was inactivated by treatment with carboxypeptidase Y, which cleaved Tyr and Ile residues from the carboxyl terminus of the α subunit but had very little effect on the β subunit. This selective and limited proteolysis prevented binding of both α and β subunits to the proteasome and therefore provides additional evidence of the heterodimeric nature of PA28. These results indicate that a short carboxyl-terminal sequence of the α subunit is critical for binding of native PA28 to the proteasome. To learn about the relative functions of the α and β subunits, PA28α was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. Purified PA28α stimulated proteasome activity but required 5-10-fold greater concentrations than the heterodimeric PA28 to achieve a given level of activity.

https://openalex.org/W2154633231,"Accumulating evidence indicates that calcification by isolated mammalian matrix vesicles (MVs) can be initiated by ATP. Since ATP can be hydrolyzed by either a specific ATPase or by nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (ALP), it remains to be established whether ATPase or ALP mediates ATP-initiated Ca and Pi deposition. To support the hypothesis that specific ATPase is responsible for ATP-initiated calcification by MVs isolated from mammalian cartilage and bone, the effects of ATP analogs, ALP substrates, and specific inhibitors on ATP hydrolysis and ATP-initiated calcification were compared between intact MVs and monoclonal antibody affinity-purified MV ALP. ATP analogs such as ADP and AMP exerted marked inhibitory effects on both [γ-32P]ATP hydrolysis and ATP-initiated calcification by intact MVs, whereas phosphomonoesters such as β-glycerophosphate or phosphoethanolamine had no effect. In contrast to intact MVs, purified MV ALP failed to calcify, and its [γ-32P]ATP hydrolytic activity was readily inhibited by phosphomonoesters. Additionally, [γ-32P]ATP hydrolysis by purified ALP in contrast to that by intact vesicles was completely inhibited by l-tetramisole, a specific inhibitor of ALP, suggesting a loss of specific ATPase during purification. Vanadate inhibition of ATP hydrolysis by purified ALP can be decreased by increasing ATP concentrations. On the contrary, ATP concentrations did not affect vanadate inhibition of ATP hydrolysis by intact MVs if ALP activity was blocked by l-tetramisole.

Investigation into the intracellular mecha-nisms of PACAP action revealed that the increase in L-channel currents was blocked by calphostin C and bisindolylmaleimide IV [protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors] and mimicked by 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), an activator of PKC. PACAP was also found to cause translocation of PKC, suggesting that the increase in the current by PACAP was due to PKC. In contrast, activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) by 8-bromo-cAMP caused an inhibition of the L-channel current. A high concentration of PACAP (1 times 10−6 M) had no effect on the L-channel current. The null effect of PACAP on the L-channel current could be converted to an increase by Rp-cAMPs, a cAMP antagonist, and a decrease by calphostin C. PACAP also increased cAMP accumulation. These observations indicate the effect of PACAP on the L-channel current represents the integration of two signaling mechanisms that involve the activation of PKA and PKC.—Chik, C.

https://openalex.org/W1978683065,"Many Golgi membrane-bound glycosyltransferases are released from cells in a soluble form. To characterize this release process, we stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells with three myc epitope-tagged forms of cloned beta1, 4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GalNAcT); two of these forms resided in the Golgi, while the third was retained in the ER. GalNAcT was released into the culture medium from cells transfected with the Golgi forms but not with the ER form of the enzyme. The medium from cells transfected with the Golgi forms contained disulfide-bonded dimers of GalNAcT, which carried neuraminidase sensitive, complex N-linked carbohydrate chains. This soluble species represented the major degradation product of cellular GalNAcT, which turned over with a half-time of about 1.7 h. The soluble species consisted of a mixture of truncated GalNAcT molecules, the major form of which was produced by cleavage near the boundary between the transmembrane and lumenal domains between Leu-23 and Tyr-24. This cleavage site fits the sequence pattern for sites cleaved by cathepsin D (van Noort, J.M., and van der Drift, A. C.M. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 14159-14164). These findings suggest that GalNAcT is converted from a membrane-bound to a soluble form as a result of cleavage by a cathepsin D-like protease in a compartment late in the Golgi secretory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1892834318,"Leukocytes produce many biological mediators that orchestrate the subsequent cellular events during wound healing. We have identified a novel cytokine, leukocyte-derived growth factor (LDGF), which is mitogenic for connective tissue cells. Sequence analysis of the LDGF peptide revealed that it is a precursor of other known peptides including platelet basic protein (PBP), connective tissue activating peptide III (CTAP-III), and neutrophil activating peptide 2 (NAP-2). None of these shorter peptides are active as mitogens for fibroblasts. LDGF appears to stimulate fibroblast growth by stimulation of tyrosine kinase activity of the PDGF receptors. One of the truncated products of LDGF, NAP-2, is a potent neutrophil chemoattractant. Peptides larger than NAP-2, such as PBP and CTAP-III, are not active as neutrophil chemoattractants. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the LDGF peptide must remain intact in order to retain its fibroblast mitogenic activity. If the LDGF peptide is processed to release the carboxyl terminal half to generate NAP-2, a peptide with proinflammatory activity is generated. These results indicate that the multiple peptides produced from the LDGF-PBP gene posses divergent biological activities that could regulate different phases of the repair process."

Newer inhibitors have recently been described that do not stabilize the covalent complex but nevertheless inhibit the function of this essential enzyme. Some of these inhibitors were shown to have a different spectrum of antitumor activity (10Boritzki T.J. Wolfard T.S. Besserer J.A. Jackson R.C. Fry D.W. Biochem.

For example, a 2,6-dioxopiperazine found to be effective against adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma was not cross-resistant to other antitumor drugs and was recently approved for clinical use in Japan (15Ohno R. Masaoka T. Shirakawa S. Sakamoto S. Hirano M. Hanada S. Yasunaga K. Yokomaku S. Mitomo Y. Nagai K. Yamada K. Furue H. Cancer (Phila.). 1993; 71: 2217-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Detailed mechanistic studies revealed that 2,6-dioxopiperazines inhibited the catalytic activity of topoisomerase II by interfering with enzyme turnover (16Roca J. Ishida R. Berger J.M. Andoh T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). These findings have renewed interest in identifying topoisomerase II inhibitors with new mechanisms of action.The catalytic cycle of topoisomerase II can be separated into six discrete steps as reviewed by Osheroff et al. (17Osheroff N. Zechiedrich E.L. Gale K.C. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 269-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar): 1) noncovalent binding of topoisomerase II to DNA; 2) establishing pre-strand passage cleavage/religation equilibrium; 3) DNA strand passage upon binding of ATP; 4) establishing cleavage/religation equilibrium following strand passage; and 5) ATP hydrolysis that results in the 6) dissociation of the enzyme from the DNA (i.e. enzyme turnover). Topoisomerase II maintains the integrity of the cleaved DNA (steps 2-4) by forming covalent, O4-phosphotyrosyl bonds with each newly created 5′-phosphate termini of the cleaved DNA segment. This transfer of phosphodiester bonds from DNA to topoisomerase II is similar to the autophosphorylation reaction of tyrosine kinases, where the enzyme forms an O4-phosphotyrosyl bond between its tyrosine and the γ-phosphate of ATP. It is possible, therefore, that kinase inhibitors that interact with the active tyrosine site of the kinase may also inhibit topoisomerase II through a similar mechanism. It was also noticed that topoisomerase II shares the second of its two consensus ATP binding motifs, GXGXXG, with protein kinases (18Markovits J. Linassier C. Fosse P. Couprie J. Jacqemin-Sablon A. Saucier J.-M. Le Pecq J.-B. Larsen A.K. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5111-5117PubMed Google Scholar). When an initial observation was made that some tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g. erbstatin, tyrphostin, and genistein) also inhibit topoisomerase II, it was suggested that these compounds inhibit both classes of enzymes by interacting with their ATP sites (18Markovits J. Linassier C. Fosse P. Couprie J. Jacqemin-Sablon A. Saucier J.-M. Le Pecq J.-B. Larsen A.K. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5111-5117PubMed Google Scholar, 19Markovits J. Larsen A.K. Segal-Bendirdjian E.

Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10485-10489Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) indicated, however, that yeast topoisomerase II uses the first of its two consensus ATP binding motifs, which is not shared with kinases, and the mechanism whereby these compounds inhibit topoisomerase II remained unelucidated. To clarify the mechanism of topoisomerase II inhibition by protein kinase antagonists, we have studied three of them in detail, including an ATP competitive inhibitor (bis-indolylmaleimide) (21Davis P.D. Elliot L.H. Harris W. Hill C.H. Hurst S. Keech E. Kumar M.K.H. Lawton G. Nixon J.S. Wilkinson S.E. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 994-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar); a substrate/ATP-competitive tyrosine kinase inhibitor (methyl-2,5-dihydroxycinnamate) (22Umezawa K. Hori T. Tajima H. Imoto M. Isshiki K. Takeuchi T. FEBS Lett. 1990; 260: 198-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and staurosporine (not competitive with either substrate or ATP) (23Ward N.E. O'Brian C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 387-392PubMed Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONGenistein inhibits protein kinases by competing at the ATP binding site (33Akiyama T. Ishida J. Nakagawa S. Ogawara H. Watanabe S. Itoh N. Shibuya M. Furakami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5592-5595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was the first tyrosine kinase inhibitor shown to also inhibit topoisomerase II (18Markovits J. Linassier C. Fosse P. Couprie J. Jacqemin-Sablon A. Saucier J.-M. Le Pecq J.-B. Larsen A.K. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5111-5117PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of ATP is required for activity of both protein kinases and topoisomerase II, and it was initially suggested that genistein inhibits both enzymes by interfering with their ATP cassettes (18Markovits J. Linassier C. Fosse P. Couprie J. Jacqemin-Sablon A. Saucier J.-M. Le Pecq J.-B. Larsen A.K. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5111-5117PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that the inhibition of topoisomerase II by genistein was partially competitive with ATP (Table I). However, this proposed mode of action is not consistent with the observation that genistein stabilized the topoisomerase II-DNA complex (18Markovits J. Linassier C. Fosse P. Couprie J. Jacqemin-Sablon A. Saucier J.-M. Le Pecq J.-B. Larsen A.K. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5111-5117PubMed Google Scholar). The binding site for genistein apparently overlaps that of etoposide, but not novobiocin, a compound known to interfere with the ATP cassette of topoisomerase II (34Corbett A.H. Hong D. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14394-14398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).These observations suggest that genistein inhibited topoisomerase II by a mechanism different than interaction with the ATP binding site. Both topoisomerase II and tyrosine kinase catalyze a phosphoesterification reaction between the phosphate group of a nucleotide and a tyrosine residue. Therefore, it is possible that tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which interfere with the formation of phosphomonoester bonds, may also inhibit the formation of phosphodiester bonds by topoisomerase II. Such compounds would inhibit the catalytic activity of the enzyme without stabilizing the topoisomerase II·DNA complexes.It was recently shown that the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g. erbstatin and tyrphostin), thought to be partially competitive at both substrate and ATP binding sites, also inhibited topoisomerase II catalytic activity (19Markovits J. Larsen A.K. Segal-Bendirdjian E. Fosse P. Saucier J.-M. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Umezawa K. Jacqemin-Sablon A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 549-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The erbstatins and tyrphostins are chemically reactive Michael acceptors and as such are capable of forming covalent adducts with nucleofile centers on proteins, preferentially cysteines, but also histidines and ϵ-amino groups (30Kupchan S.M. Fessler D.C. Eakin M.A. Giacobbe T.J. Science. 1970; 168: 376-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Topoisomerase II can be inhibited by exposure to N-ethylmaleimide (31Sander M. Nolan J.M. Hsieh T-s. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6938-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), another Michael acceptor reacting with nucleofiles. It is, therefore, possible that the mechanism of topoisomerase II inhibition by erbstatin and tyrphostin is identical to that of N-ethylmaleimide. To test this hypothesis, we have studied the inhibition of topoisomerase II by the erbstatin methyl-2,5-dihydroxycinnamate (22Umezawa K. Hori T. Tajima H. Imoto M. Isshiki K. Takeuchi T. FEBS Lett. 1990; 260: 198-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and compared it to N-ethylmaleimide. Both compounds blocked formation of the ATP-independent topoisomerase II·DNA complex. 2G. Singh and P. Lassota, unpublished result. Preincubation of these compounds with an excess of dithiothreitol totally abolished inhibition of the enzyme by N-ethylmaleimide as well as by methyl-2,5-dihydroxycinnamate. In both cases, inhibition of the catalytic activity was partially competitive with ATP. It is known that ATP binding to topoisomerase II changes the conformation of the enzyme from “open” to “closed” (35Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 833-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), possibly rendering target nucleofiles less accessible to N-ethylmaleimide or methyl-2,5-dihydroxycinnamate. Thus, ATP may protect topoisomerase II from inactivation by an allosteric effect. These results strongly suggest that 2,5-dihydroxycinnamate inactivates topoisomerase II by alkylating residues essential for the enzyme activity, most likely cysteines.Staurosporine was originally thought to be an ATP-competitive inhibitor specific for protein kinase C. More recent studies showed that it is a broad, potent inhibitor of various kinases, including tyrosine kinases, and does not compete with ATP (23Ward N.E. O'Brian C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 387-392PubMed Google Scholar, 36Tamaoki T. Nomoto H. Takahashi I. Kato Y. Morimoto M. Tomita F. Biochem. Biophys Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar, 37Ruegg U.T. Burgess G.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; 10: 218-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). We report here that staurosporine is also a potent inhibitor of the catalytic activity of topoisomerase II, does not seem to compete with ATP, and that it inhibits the ATP-independent transfer of phosphodiester bonds from DNA to the active site tyrosine residues of the enzyme. Staurosporine does not react with thiols, which makes its mechanism of action different from that of the erbstatins. Staurosporine is the first topoisomerase II inhibitor shown to directly interfere with the transfer of phosphodiester bonds from DNA to the enzyme. Although staurosporine is not selective for topoisomerase II, it may be possible to develop analogs that are selective for this enzyme. Similar efforts to optimize the specificity of staurosporine toward protein kinase C were successful, resulting in the synthesis of bis-indolylmaleimide, a selective and potent, ATP-competitive inhibitor of protein kinase C, that only modestly affects other kinases (21Davis P.D. Elliot L.H. Harris W. Hill C.H. Hurst S. Keech E. Kumar M.K.H. Lawton G. Nixon J.S. Wilkinson S.E. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 994-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). This compound inhibited topoisomerase II but was less potent than staurosporine and was partially competitive with ATP. Surprisingly, it was shown to interact directly with DNA, suggesting that it may inhibit topoisomerase II by more than one mechanism.It was recently shown that compounds that inhibit the catalytic activity of topoisomerase II but that do not stabilize the formation of topoisomerase II·DNA complexes are clinically useful in the treatment of cancer (15Ohno R. Masaoka T. Shirakawa S. Sakamoto S. Hirano M. Hanada S. Yasunaga K. Yokomaku S. Mitomo Y. Nagai K. Yamada K. Furue H. Cancer (Phila.). 1993; 71: 2217-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the ATP-independent transfer of the phosphodiester bond from the DNA to the enzyme can constitute a target for the design and development of novel anticancer drugs.

To clarify the mechanism of topoisomerase II inhibition by protein kinase antagonists, we have studied three of them in detail, including an ATP competitive inhibitor (bis-indolylmaleimide) (21Davis P.D. Elliot L.H. Harris W. Hill C.H. Hurst S. Keech E. Kumar M.K.H. Lawton G. Nixon J.S. Wilkinson S.E. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 994-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar); a substrate/ATP-competitive tyrosine kinase inhibitor (methyl-2,5-dihydroxycinnamate) (22Umezawa K. Hori T. Tajima H. Imoto M. Isshiki K. Takeuchi T. FEBS Lett. 1990; 260: 198-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and staurosporine (not competitive with either substrate or ATP) (23Ward N.E. O'Brian C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 387-392PubMed Google Scholar). Topoisomerase II is a nuclear enzyme that regulates the topology of DNA by passing an intact double strand of DNA through transient double-stranded breaks created in an adjacent DNA segment (1Osheroff N. Shelton E.R. Brutlag D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9536-9543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Wang J.C. Annu. Rev.

This allows for resolution of topological perturbations that occur during transcription (4Drolet M. Wu H.Y. Liu L.F. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29A: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), DNA replication, and separation of chromosomes (5Nitiss J.L. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29A: 103-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the past decade, a number of clinically important and structurally diverse antineoplastic agents have been found to exert their cytotoxic mechanism by stabilizing the covalent complex formed between topoisomerase II and DNA (e.g. etoposide, mitoxantrone, and Adriamycin; reviewed in 6Corbett A.H. Osheroff N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Accumulation of these covalent protein-DNA intermediates activates apoptosis, resulting in cell death (7Roy C. Brown D.L. Little J.E. Valentine B.K. Walker P.R. Sikorska M. Leblanc J. Chaly N. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 200: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 8Kaufmann S.H. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5870-5878PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hickman J.A. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1992; 11: 121-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). Newer inhibitors have recently been described that do not stabilize the covalent complex but nevertheless inhibit the function of this essential enzyme. Some of these inhibitors were shown to have a different spectrum of antitumor activity (10Boritzki T.J. Wolfard T.S. Besserer J.A. Jackson R.C. Fry D.W. Biochem.

Utsumi K.R. Tanabe K. Andoh T. Cancer. Res. 1991; 51: 4909-4916PubMed Google Scholar) compared to etoposide or Adriamycin. For example, a 2,6-dioxopiperazine found to be effective against adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma was not cross-resistant to other antitumor drugs and was recently approved for clinical use in Japan (15Ohno R. Masaoka T. Shirakawa S. Sakamoto S. Hirano M. Hanada S. Yasunaga K. Yokomaku S. Mitomo Y. Nagai K. Yamada K. Furue H. Cancer (Phila.). 1993; 71: 2217-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Detailed mechanistic studies revealed that 2,6-dioxopiperazines inhibited the catalytic activity of topoisomerase II by interfering with enzyme turnover (16Roca J. Ishida R. Berger J.M. Andoh T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). These findings have renewed interest in identifying topoisomerase II inhibitors with new mechanisms of action. The catalytic cycle of topoisomerase II can be separated into six discrete steps as reviewed by Osheroff et al. (17Osheroff N. Zechiedrich E.L. Gale K.C. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 269-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar): 1) noncovalent binding of topoisomerase II to DNA; 2) establishing pre-strand passage cleavage/religation equilibrium; 3) DNA strand passage upon binding of ATP; 4) establishing cleavage/religation equilibrium following strand passage; and 5) ATP hydrolysis that results in the 6) dissociation of the enzyme from the DNA (i.e. enzyme turnover). Topoisomerase II maintains the integrity of the cleaved DNA (steps 2-4) by forming covalent, O4-phosphotyrosyl bonds with each newly created 5′-phosphate termini of the cleaved DNA segment. This transfer of phosphodiester bonds from DNA to topoisomerase II is similar to the autophosphorylation reaction of tyrosine kinases, where the enzyme forms an O4-phosphotyrosyl bond between its tyrosine and the γ-phosphate of ATP. It is possible, therefore, that kinase inhibitors that interact with the active tyrosine site of the kinase may also inhibit topoisomerase II through a similar mechanism. It was also noticed that topoisomerase II shares the second of its two consensus ATP binding motifs, GXGXXG, with protein kinases (18Markovits J. Linassier C. Fosse P. Couprie J. Jacqemin-Sablon A. Saucier J.-M. Le Pecq J.-B. Larsen A.K. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5111-5117PubMed Google Scholar). When an initial observation was made that some tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g. erbstatin, tyrphostin, and genistein) also inhibit topoisomerase II, it was suggested that these compounds inhibit both classes of enzymes by interacting with their ATP sites (18Markovits J.

Chem. 1992; 35: 994-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar); a substrate/ATP-competitive tyrosine kinase inhibitor (methyl-2,5-dihydroxycinnamate) (22Umezawa K. Hori T. Tajima H. Imoto M. Isshiki K. Takeuchi T. FEBS Lett. 1990; 260: 198-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and staurosporine (not competitive with either substrate or ATP) (23Ward N.E. O'Brian C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 387-392PubMed Google Scholar). DISCUSSIONGenistein inhibits protein kinases by competing at the ATP binding site (33Akiyama T. Ishida J. Nakagawa S. Ogawara H. Watanabe S. Itoh N. Shibuya M. Furakami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5592-5595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was the first tyrosine kinase inhibitor shown to also inhibit topoisomerase II (18Markovits J. Linassier C. Fosse P. Couprie J. Jacqemin-Sablon A. Saucier J.-M. Le Pecq J.-B. Larsen A.K. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5111-5117PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of ATP is required for activity of both protein kinases and topoisomerase II, and it was initially suggested that genistein inhibits both enzymes by interfering with their ATP cassettes (18Markovits J. Linassier C. Fosse P. Couprie J. Jacqemin-Sablon A. Saucier J.-M. Le Pecq J.-B. Larsen A.K. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5111-5117PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that the inhibition of topoisomerase II by genistein was partially competitive with ATP (Table I). However, this proposed mode of action is not consistent with the observation that genistein stabilized the topoisomerase II-DNA complex (18Markovits J. Linassier C. Fosse P. Couprie J. Jacqemin-Sablon A. Saucier J.-M. Le Pecq J.-B. Larsen A.K. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5111-5117PubMed Google Scholar). The binding site for genistein apparently overlaps that of etoposide, but not novobiocin, a compound known to interfere with the ATP cassette of topoisomerase II (34Corbett A.H. Hong D. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14394-14398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).These observations suggest that genistein inhibited topoisomerase II by a mechanism different than interaction with the ATP binding site. Both topoisomerase II and tyrosine kinase catalyze a phosphoesterification reaction between the phosphate group of a nucleotide and a tyrosine residue. Therefore, it is possible that tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which interfere with the formation of phosphomonoester bonds, may also inhibit the formation of phosphodiester bonds by topoisomerase II. Such compounds would inhibit the catalytic activity of the enzyme without stabilizing the topoisomerase II·DNA complexes.It was recently shown that the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g. erbstatin and tyrphostin), thought to be partially competitive at both substrate and ATP binding sites, also inhibited topoisomerase II catalytic activity (19Markovits J. Larsen A.K. Segal-Bendirdjian E. Fosse P. Saucier J.-M. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Umezawa K. Jacqemin-Sablon A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 549-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The erbstatins and tyrphostins are chemically reactive Michael acceptors and as such are capable of forming covalent adducts with nucleofile centers on proteins, preferentially cysteines, but also histidines and ϵ-amino groups (30Kupchan S.M. Fessler D.C. Eakin M.A. Giacobbe T.J. Science. 1970; 168: 376-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Topoisomerase II can be inhibited by exposure to N-ethylmaleimide (31Sander M. Nolan J.M. Hsieh T-s. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6938-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), another Michael acceptor reacting with nucleofiles. It is, therefore, possible that the mechanism of topoisomerase II inhibition by erbstatin and tyrphostin is identical to that of N-ethylmaleimide. To test this hypothesis, we have studied the inhibition of topoisomerase II by the erbstatin methyl-2,5-dihydroxycinnamate (22Umezawa K. Hori T. Tajima H. Imoto M. Isshiki K. Takeuchi T. FEBS Lett. 1990; 260: 198-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and compared it to N-ethylmaleimide. Both compounds blocked formation of the ATP-independent topoisomerase II·DNA complex. 2G. Singh and P. Lassota, unpublished result. Preincubation of these compounds with an excess of dithiothreitol totally abolished inhibition of the enzyme by N-ethylmaleimide as well as by methyl-2,5-dihydroxycinnamate. In both cases, inhibition of the catalytic activity was partially competitive with ATP. It is known that ATP binding to topoisomerase II changes the conformation of the enzyme from “open” to “closed” (35Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 833-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), possibly rendering target nucleofiles less accessible to N-ethylmaleimide or methyl-2,5-dihydroxycinnamate. Thus, ATP may protect topoisomerase II from inactivation by an allosteric effect. These results strongly suggest that 2,5-dihydroxycinnamate inactivates topoisomerase II by alkylating residues essential for the enzyme activity, most likely cysteines.Staurosporine was originally thought to be an ATP-competitive inhibitor specific for protein kinase C. More recent studies showed that it is a broad, potent inhibitor of various kinases, including tyrosine kinases, and does not compete with ATP (23Ward N.E. O'Brian C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 387-392PubMed Google Scholar, 36Tamaoki T. Nomoto H. Takahashi I. Kato Y. Morimoto M. Tomita F. Biochem. Biophys Res.

We report here that staurosporine is also a potent inhibitor of the catalytic activity of topoisomerase II, does not seem to compete with ATP, and that it inhibits the ATP-independent transfer of phosphodiester bonds from DNA to the active site tyrosine residues of the enzyme. Staurosporine does not react with thiols, which makes its mechanism of action different from that of the erbstatins. Staurosporine is the first topoisomerase II inhibitor shown to directly interfere with the transfer of phosphodiester bonds from DNA to the enzyme. Although staurosporine is not selective for topoisomerase II, it may be possible to develop analogs that are selective for this enzyme. Similar efforts to optimize the specificity of staurosporine toward protein kinase C were successful, resulting in the synthesis of bis-indolylmaleimide, a selective and potent, ATP-competitive inhibitor of protein kinase C, that only modestly affects other kinases (21Davis P.D. Elliot L.H. Harris W. Hill C.H. Hurst S. Keech E. Kumar M.K.H. Lawton G. Nixon J.S. Wilkinson S.E. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 994-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). This compound inhibited topoisomerase II but was less potent than staurosporine and was partially competitive with ATP. Surprisingly, it was shown to interact directly with DNA, suggesting that it may inhibit topoisomerase II by more than one mechanism.It was recently shown that compounds that inhibit the catalytic activity of topoisomerase II but that do not stabilize the formation of topoisomerase II·DNA complexes are clinically useful in the treatment of cancer (15Ohno R.

https://openalex.org/W1550607492,"Numerous studies have suggested that enhanced membrane phospholipid degradation contributes to hypoxic and ischemic injury. Recently, acidosis has been found to potently protect against hypoxic and ischemic injury. To investigate the interrelationships of these two events in hypoxic injury, we studied the role of a pH-dependent group II phospholipase A2 (PLA2, E.C. 3.1.1.4) in chemical hypoxic injury in rat hepatocytes. Northern blot analysis of RNA extracted from normoxic and hypoxic rat hepatocytes with group II rat liver PLA2-specific oligonucleotide cDNA probes revealed a 0.9 kb transcript whose abundance was significantly increased in rat hepatocytes within 15 min after initiation of chemical hypoxia and remained high until cells lost viability. Immunofluorescence staining of hepatocytes with polyclonal antibodies that recognize group II PLA2 demonstrated a substantial increase in the level of PLA2 protein in hypoxic rat hepatocytes within 30 min of initiation of hypoxic injury. Treatment of hepatocytes with group II PLA2-specific anti-sense DNA oligonucleotides: 1) abolished accumulation of PLA2 protein in hypoxic rat hepatocytes as assessed by immunofluorescence staining with anti-PLA2 antibodies; 2) decreased the enzymatic activity of PLA2 manifested as decreased arachidonic acid release in hypoxic hepatocytes; and 3) significantly delayed cell death evoked by chemical hypoxia as indicated by a decrease in propidium iodide uptake. These findings suggest that pH-dependent group II PLA2 plays an important role in chemical hypoxic injury of rat hepatocytes."

The global analysis of upstream activation sequences containing sites A and B, A and B one-half helical turn out of phase, and only B yielded values for the intrinsic and cooperative binding free energies of ΔG0A = −9.5 ± 0.3, ΔG0B = −11.2 ± 0.2, and ΔG0AB = −2.5 ± 0.5. A separate analysis of data from upstream activation sequences containing site A and a point mutant of site B, and site A and mutant site B one-half helical turn out of phase confirmed the estimate of cooperativity, yielding free energy values of ΔG0A = −9.4 ± 0.2, ΔG0B(G→C) = −10.0 ± 0.2, and ΔG0AB(G→C) = −2.2 ± 0.4. We previously showed that removing the two-component receiver domain from DctD, making DctDΔ(1-142), yields a constitutively active truncated protein.
