https://openalex.org/W2016253387,"Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) are some of the most common human diseases worldwide. However, they have a complex and diverse etiology, and the characteristics of the pathogens involved in respiratory infections in developing countries are not well understood. In this work, we analyzed the characteristics of 17 common respiratory pathogens in children (≤14 years old) with ARI in Guangzhou, southern China over a 3-year period using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Pathogens were identified in 2361/4242 (55.7%) patients, and the positivity rate varied seasonally. Ten of the 17 pathogens investigated showed positivity rates of more than 5%. The most frequently detected pathogens were respiratory syncytial virus (768/2361, 32.5%), influenza A virus (428/2361, 18.1%), enterovirus (138/2361, 13.3%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (267/2361, 11.3%) and adenovirus (213/2361, 9.0%). Co-pathogens were common and found in 503 of 2361 (21.3%) positive samples. When ranked according to frequency of occurrence, the pattern of co-pathogens was similar to that of the primary pathogens, with the exception of human bocavirus, human coronavirus and human metapneumovirus. Significant differences were found in age prevalence in 10 of the 17 pathogens (p≤0.009): four basic patterns were observed, A: detection rates increased with age, B: detection rates declined with age, C: the detection rate showed distinct peaks or D: numbers of patients were too low to detect a trend or showed no significant difference among age groups (p>0.05). These data will be useful for planning vaccine research and control strategies and for studies predicting pathogen prevalence."
https://openalex.org/W2053287898,"The aim of this study was to assess the mechanisms of transmission of bluetongue virus serotype 26 (BTV-26) in goats. A previous study, which investigated the pathogenicity and infection kinetics of BTV-26 in goats, unexpectedly revealed that one control goat may have been infected through a direct contact transmission route. To investigate the transmission mechanisms of BTV-26 in more detail an experimental infection study was carried out in which three goats were infected with BTV-26, three goats were kept uninfected, but were housed in direct contact with the infected goats, and an additional four goats were kept in indirect contact separated from infected goats by metal gates. This barrier allowed the goats to have occasional face-to-face contact in the same airspace, but feeding, watering, sampling and environmental cleaning was carried out separately. The three experimentally infected goats did not show clinical signs of BTV, however high levels of viral RNA were detected and virus was isolated from their blood. At 21 dpi viral RNA was detected in, and virus was isolated from the blood of the three direct contact goats, which also seroconverted. The four indirect barrier contact goats remained uninfected throughout the duration of the experiment. In order to assess replication in a laboratory model species of Culicoides biting midge, more than 300 Culicoides sonorensis were fed a BTV-26 spiked blood meal and incubated for 7 days. The dissemination of BTV-26 in individual C. sonorensis was inferred from the quantity of virus RNA and indicated that none of the insects processed at day 7 possessed transmissible infections. This study shows that BTV-26 is easily transmitted through direct contact transmission between goats, and the strain does not seem to replicate in C. sonorensis midges using standard incubation conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1985589273,"Coral reefs and associated fish populations have experienced rapid decline in the Caribbean region and marine protected areas (MPAs) have been widely implemented to address this decline. The performance of no-take MPAs (i.e., marine reserves) for protecting and rebuilding fish populations is influenced by the movement of animals within and across their boundaries. Very little is known about Caribbean reef fish movements creating a critical knowledge gap that can impede effective MPA design, performance and evaluation. Using miniature implanted acoustic transmitters and a fixed acoustic receiver array, we address three key questions: How far can reef fish move? Does connectivity exist between adjacent MPAs? Does existing MPA size match the spatial scale of reef fish movements? We show that many reef fishes are capable of traveling far greater distances and in shorter duration than was previously known. Across the Puerto Rican Shelf, more than half of our 163 tagged fish (18 species of 10 families) moved distances greater than 1 km with three fish moving more than 10 km in a single day and a quarter spending time outside of MPAs. We provide direct evidence of ecological connectivity across a network of MPAs, including estimated movements of more than 40 km connecting a nearshore MPA with a shelf-edge spawning aggregation. Most tagged fish showed high fidelity to MPAs, but also spent time outside MPAs, potentially contributing to spillover. Three-quarters of our fish were capable of traveling distances that would take them beyond the protection offered by at least 40–64% of the existing eastern Caribbean MPAs. We recommend that key species movement patterns be used to inform and evaluate MPA functionality and design, particularly size and shape. A re-scaling of our perception of Caribbean reef fish mobility and habitat use is imperative, with important implications for ecology and management effectiveness."
https://openalex.org/W1985365198,"Adaptive anxiety relies on a balance between the generalization of fear acquisition and fear extinction. Research on fear (extinction) generalization has focused mostly on perceptual similarity, thereby ignoring the importance of conceptual stimulus relations in humans. The present study used a laboratory procedure to create de novo conceptual categories of arbitrary stimuli and investigated fear and extinction generalization among these stimuli. A matching-to-sample task produced two four-member categories of abstract figures. Next, a member from one category was coupled with an aversive electrical stimulation, while a member from the other category was presented alone. As expected, conditioned fear responses generalized to the other members of the first category (skin conductance and online shock-expectancy). Subsequent extinction of the conditioned member also generalized to the other members. However, extinguishing a non-conditioned member failed to reduce fear of the conditioned member itself. We conclude that fears generalize readily across conceptually related stimuli, but that the degree of extinction generalization depends on the stimulus subjected to extinction."
https://openalex.org/W1988956018,"Background Novel developmental functions have been attributed to the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) including proliferation stimulation and neural differentiation. Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC), induced with retinoic acid to neural differentiation, closely assemble processes occurring during neuroectodermal development of the early embryo. Principal Findings P2X7R expression together with the pluripotency marker Oct-4 was highest in undifferentiated ESC. In undifferentiated cells, the P2X7R agonist Bz-ATP accelerated cell cycle entry, which was blocked by the specific P2X7R inhibitor KN-62. ESC induced to neural differentiation with retinoic acid, reduced Oct-4 and P2X7R expression. P2X7R receptor-promoted intracellular calcium fluxes were obtained at lower Bz-ATP ligand concentrations in undifferentiated and in neural-differentiated cells compared to other studies. The presence of KN-62 led to increased number of cells expressing SSEA-1, Dcx and β3-tubulin, as well as the number of SSEA-1 and β3-tubulin-double-positive cells confirming that onset of neuroectodermal differentiation and neuronal fate determination depends on suppression of P2X7R activity. Moreover, an increase in the number of Ki-67 positive cells in conditions of P2X7R inhibition indicates rescue of progenitors into the cell cycle, augmenting the number of neuroblasts and consequently neurogenesis. Conclusions In embryonic cells, P2X7R expression and activity is upregulated, maintaining proliferation, while upon induction to neural differentiation P2X7 receptor expression and activity needs to be suppressed."
https://openalex.org/W2105193644,"The beneficial human gut microbe Faecalibacterium prausnitzii is a 'probiotic of the future' since it produces high amounts of butyrate and anti-inflammatory compounds. However, this bacterium is highly oxygen-senstive, making it notoriously difficult to cultivate and preserve. This has so far precluded its clinical application in the treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases. The present studies were therefore aimed at developing a strategy to keep F. prausnitzii alive at ambient air. Our previous research showed that F. prausnitzii can survive in moderately oxygenized environments like the gut mucosa by transfer of electrons to oxygen. For this purpose, the bacterium exploits extracellular antioxidants, such as riboflavin and cysteine, that are abundantly present in the gut. We therefore tested to what extent these antioxidants can sustain the viability of F. prausnitzii at ambient air. The present results show that cysteine can facilitate the survival of F. prausnitzii upon exposure to air, and that this effect is significantly enhanced the by addition of riboflavin and the cryoprotectant inulin. The highly oxygen-sensitive gut bacterium F. prausnitzii can be kept alive at ambient air for 24 h when formulated with the antioxidants cysteine and riboflavin plus the cryoprotectant inulin. Improved formulations were obtained by addition of the bulking agents corn starch and wheat bran. Our present findings pave the way towards the biomedical exploitation of F. prausnitzii in redox-based therapeutics for treatment of dysbiosis-related inflammatory disorders of the human gut."
https://openalex.org/W2082993707,"In our previous study, microvesicles (MVs) released from human Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells (hWJ-MSCs) retard the growth of bladder cancer cells. We would like to know if MVs have a similar effect on human renal cell carcinoma (RCC). By use of cell culture and the BALB/c nu/nu mice xeno-graft model, the influence of MVs upon the growth and aggressiveness of RCC (786-0) was assessed. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, incidence of tumor, tumor size, Ki-67 or TUNEL staining was used to evaluate tumor cell growth in vitro or in vivo. Flow cytometry assay (in vitro) or examination of cyclin D1 expression (in vivo) was carried out to determine the alteration of cell cycle. The aggressiveness was analyzed by Wound Healing Assay (in vitro) or MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression (in vivo). AKT/p-AKT, ERK1/2/p-ERK1/2 or HGF/c-MET expression was detected by real-time PCR or western blot. Our data demonstrated that MVs promote the growth and aggressiveness of RCC both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, MVs facilitated the progression of cell cycle from G0/1 to S. HGF expression in RCC was greatly induced by MVs, associated with activation of AKT and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. RNase pre-treatment abrogated all effects of MVs. In summary, induction of HGF synthesis via RNA transferred by MVs activating AKT and ERK1/2 signaling is one of crucial contributors to the pro-tumor effect."
https://openalex.org/W2096774009,"The JmjC domain-containing protein JMJD3/KDM6B catalyses the demethylation of H3K27me3 and H3K27me2. JMJD3 appears to be highly regulated at the transcriptional level and is upregulated in response to diverse stimuli such as differentiation inducers and stress signals. Accordingly, JMJD3 has been linked to the regulation of different biological processes such as differentiation of embryonic stem cells, inflammatory responses in macrophages, and induction of cellular senescence via regulation of the INK4A-ARF locus. Here we show here that JMJD3 interacts with the tumour suppressor protein p53. We find that the interaction is dependent on the p53 tetramerization domain. Following DNA damage, JMJD3 is transcriptionally upregulated and by performing genome-wide mapping of JMJD3, we demonstrate that it binds genes involved in basic cellular processes, as well as genes regulating cell cycle, response to stress and apoptosis. Moreover, we find that JMJD3 binding sites show significant overlap with p53 bound promoters and enhancer elements. The binding of JMJD3 to p53 target sites is increased in response to DNA damage, and we demonstrate that the recruitment of JMJD3 to these sites is dependent on p53 expression. Therefore, we propose a model in which JMJD3 is recruited to p53 responsive elements via its interaction with p53 and speculate that JMJD3 could act as a fail-safe mechanism to remove low levels of H3K27me3 and H3K27me2 to allow for efficient acetylation of H3K27."
https://openalex.org/W1987736199,"It is hypothesized that allergens are at the borderline of self and non-self and, through as yet elusive circumstances, mount a Th2 response for allergic sensitization. The major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 is considered the prototype for the PR-10 protein family causing respiratory allergy. Here, we give structural evidence that Bet v 1 is a lipocalin-like protein with a striking structural resemblance to human lipocalin 2. Lipocalin 2 is highly expressed in the lung where it exerts immunoregulatory functions dependent on being loaded with siderophore-bound iron (holo-form) or not (apo-form). We demonstrate that similar to lipocalin 2, Bet v 1 is capable of binding iron via catechol-based siderophores. Thereby, calculated Kd values of 66 nm surpassed affinities to known ligands nearly by a power of 10. Moreover, we give functional evidence of the immunomodulatory capacity of Bet v 1 being dependent on its iron-loaded state. When incubated to human immune cells, only the apo-form of Bet v 1, but not the holo-form, was able to promote Th2 cells secreting IL13. These results provide for the first time a functional understanding on the allergenicity of Bet v 1 and a basis for future allergen immunotherapies counteracting Th2 immune responses on a molecular basis."
https://openalex.org/W1964884567,"Objective Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) by repeated brief limb ischemia/reperfusion reduces myocardial injury in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) in left ventricular (LV) myocardium at early reperfusion is associated with such protection. Autophagy, i.e., removal of dysfunctional cellular components through lysosomes, has been proposed as one mechanism of cardioprotection. Therefore, we analyzed whether or not the protection by RIPC is associated with activated autophagy. Methods CABG patients were randomized to undergo RIPC (3×5 min blood pressure cuff inflation/5 min deflation) or placebo (cuff deflated) before skin incision (n = 10/10). Transmural myocardial biopsies were taken from the LV before cardioplegia (baseline) and at early (5–10 min) reperfusion. RIPC-induced protection was reflected by decreased serum troponin I concentration area under the curve (194±17 versus 709±129 ng/ml × 72 h, p = 0.002). Western blotting for beclin-1-phosphorylation and protein expression of autophagy-related gene 5–12 (ATG5-12) complex, light chain 3 (LC3), parkin, and p62 was performed. STAT3-, STAT5- and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)-phosphorylation was used as positive control to confirm signal activation by ischemia/reperfusion. Results Signals of all analyzed autophagy proteins did not differ between baseline and early reperfusion and not between RIPC and placebo. STAT5-phosphorylation was greater at early reperfusion only with RIPC (2.2-fold, p = 0.02). STAT3- and ERK1/2-phosphorylation were greater at early reperfusion with placebo and RIPC (≥2.7-fold versus baseline, p≤0.05). Conclusion Protection through RIPC in patients undergoing CABG surgery does not appear to be associated with enhanced autophagy in LV myocardium at early reperfusion."
https://openalex.org/W2055275875,"Sorafenib, the drug used as first line treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4-mediated oxidation and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) 1A9-mediated glucuronidation. Liver diseases are associated with reduced CYP and UGT activities, which can considerably affect drug metabolism, leading to drug toxicity. Thus, understanding the metabolism of therapeutic compounds in patients with liver diseases is necessary. However, the metabolism characteristic of sorafenib has not been systematically determined in HCC patients.Sorafenib metabolism was tested in the pooled and individual tumor hepatic microsomes (THLMs) and adjacent normal hepatic microsomes (NHLMs) of HCC patients (n = 18). Commercial hepatic microsomes (CHLMs) were used as a control. In addition, CYP3A4 and UGT1A9 protein expression in different tissues were measured by Western blotting.The mean rates of oxidation and glucuronidation of sorafenib were significantly decreased in the pooled THLMs compared with those in NHLMs and CHLMs. The maximal velocity (Vmax) of sorafenib oxidation and glucuronidation were approximately 25-fold and 2-fold decreased in the pooled THLMs, respectively, with unchanged Km values. The oxidation of sorafenib in individual THLMs sample was significantly decreased (ranging from 7 to 67-fold) than that in corresponding NHLMs sample. The reduction of glucuronidation in THLMs was observed in 15 out of 18 patients' samples. Additionally, the level of CYP3A4 and UGT1A9 expression were both notably decreased in the pooled THLMs.Sorafenib metabolism was remarkably decreased in THLMs. This result was associated with the down regulation of the protein expression of CYP3A4 and UGT1A9."
https://openalex.org/W2157502350,"Esat-6 protein secretion systems (ESX or Ess) are required for the virulence of several human pathogens, most notably Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Staphylococcus aureus. These secretion systems are defined by a conserved FtsK/SpoIIIE family ATPase and one or more WXG100 family secreted substrates. Gene clusters coding for ESX systems have been identified amongst many organisms including the highly tractable model system, Bacillus subtilis. In this study, we demonstrate that the B. subtilis yuk/yue locus codes for a nonessential ESX secretion system. We develop a functional secretion assay to demonstrate that each of the locus gene products is specifically required for secretion of the WXG100 virulence factor homolog, YukE. We then employ an unbiased approach to search for additional secreted substrates. By quantitative profiling of culture supernatants, we find that YukE may be the sole substrate that depends on the FtsK/SpoIIIE family ATPase for secretion. We discuss potential functional implications for secretion of a unique substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2068050275,"Monocyte exposure to mitochondrial Danger Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs), including mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), induces a transient state in which these cells are refractory to further endotoxin stimulation. In this context, IRAK-M up-regulation and impaired p65 activity were observed. This phenomenon, termed endotoxin tolerance (ET), is characterized by decreased production of cytokines in response to the pro-inflammatory stimulus. We also show that monocytes isolated from patients with myocardial infarction (MI) exhibited high levels of circulating mtDNA, which correlated with ET status. Moreover, a significant incidence of infection was observed in those patients with a strong tolerant phenotype. The present data extend our current understanding of the implications of endotoxin tolerance. Furthermore, our data suggest that the levels of mitochondrial antigens in plasma, such as plasma mtDNA, should be useful as a marker of increased risk of susceptibility to nosocomial infections in MI and in other pathologies involving tissue damage."
https://openalex.org/W1964269606,"Vaccination against the highly abused prescription opioid oxycodone has shown pre-clinical efficacy for blocking oxycodone effects. The current study further evaluated a candidate vaccine composed of oxycodone derivatized at the C6 position (6OXY) conjugated to the native keyhole limpet hemocyanin (nKLH) carrier protein. To provide an oxycodone vaccine formulation suitable for human studies, we studied the effect of alternative carriers and adjuvants on the generation of oxycodone-specific serum antibody and B cell responses, and the effect of immunization on oxycodone distribution and oxycodone-induced antinociception in mice and rats. 6OXY conjugated to tetanus toxoid (TT) or a GMP grade KLH dimer (dKLH) was as effective as 6OXY conjugated to the nKLH decamer in mice and rats, while the 6OXY hapten conjugated to a TT-derived peptide was not effective in preventing oxycodone-induced antinociception in mice. Immunization with 6OXY-TT s.c. absorbed on alum adjuvant provided similar protection to 6OXY-TT administered i.p. with Freund's adjuvant in rats. The toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) adjuvant, alone or in combination with alum, offered no advantage over alum alone for generating oxycodone-specific serum antibodies or 6OXY-specific antibody secreting B cells in mice vaccinated with 6OXY-nKLH or 6OXY-TT. The immunogenicity of oxycodone vaccines may be modulated by TLR4 signaling since responses to 6OXY-nKLH in alum were decreased in TLR4-deficient mice. These data suggest that TT, nKLH and dKLH carriers provide consistent 6OXY conjugate vaccine immunogenicity across species, strains and via different routes of administration, while adjuvant formulations may need to be tailored to individual immunogens or patient populations."
https://openalex.org/W2023782926,"Polymerase-δ interacting protein 2 (Poldip2) is an understudied protein, originally described as a binding partner of polymerase delta and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Numerous roles for Poldip2 have been proposed, including mitochondrial elongation, DNA replication/repair and ROS production via Nox4. In this study, we have identified a novel role for Poldip2 in regulating the cell cycle. We used a Poldip2 gene-trap mouse and found that homozygous animals die around the time of birth. Poldip2−/− embryos are significantly smaller than wild type or heterozygous embryos. We found that Poldip2−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibit reduced growth as measured by population doubling and growth curves. This effect is not due to apoptosis or senescence; however, Poldip2−/− MEFs have higher levels of the autophagy marker LC3b. Measurement of DNA content by flow cytometry revealed an increase in the percentage of Poldip2−/− cells in the G1 and G2/M phases of the cell cycle, accompanied by a decrease in the percentage of S-phase cells. Increases in p53 S20 and Sirt1 were observed in passage 2 Poldip2−/− MEFs. In passage 4/5 MEFs, Cdk1 and CyclinA2 are downregulated in Poldip2−/− cells, and these changes are reversed by transfection with SV40 large T-antigen, suggesting that Poldip2 may target the E2F pathway. In contrast, p21CIP1 is increased in passage 4/5 Poldip2−/− MEFs and its expression is unaffected by SV40 transfection. Overall, these results reveal that Poldip2 is an essential protein in development, and underline its importance in cell viability and proliferation. Because it affects the cell cycle, Poldip2 is a potential novel target for treating proliferative conditions such as cancer, atherosclerosis and restenosis."
https://openalex.org/W2068258578,"The complement system is an essential part of the innate immune system by acting as a first line of defense which is stabilized by properdin, the sole known positive regulator of the alternative complement pathway. Dysregulation of complement can promote a diversity of human inflammatory diseases which are treated by complement inhibitors. Here, we generated a novel blocking monoclonal antibody (mAb) against properdin and devised a new diagnostic assay for this important complement regulator. Mouse mAb 1340 specifically detected native properdin from human samples with high avidity. MAb 1340 inhibited specifically the alternative complement mediated cell lysis within a concentration range of 1–10 µg/mL. Thus, in vitro anti-properdin mAb 1340 was up to fifteen times more efficient in blocking the complement system as compared to anti-C5 or anti-Ba antibodies. Computer-assisted modelling suggested a three-dimensional binding epitope in a properdin-C3(H2O)-clusterin complex to be responsible for the inhibition. Recovery of properdin in a newly established sandwich ELISA using mAb 1340 was determined at 80–125% for blood sample dilutions above 1∶50. Reproducibility assays showed a variation below 25% at dilutions less than 1∶1,000. Systemic properdin concentrations of healthy controls and patients with age-related macular degeneration or rheumatic diseases were all in the range of 13–30 µg/mL and did not reveal significant differences. These initial results encourage further investigation into the functional role of properdin in the development, progression and treatment of diseases related to the alternative complement pathway. Thus, mAb 1340 represents a potent properdin inhibitor suitable for further research to understand the exact mechanisms how properdin activates the complement C3-convertase and to determine quantitative levels of properdin in biological samples."
https://openalex.org/W2151874688,"Wheat blue dwarf (WBD) disease is an important disease that has caused heavy losses in wheat production in northwestern China. This disease is caused by WBD phytoplasma, which is transmitted by Psammotettix striatus. Until now, no genome information about WBD phytoplasma has been published, seriously restricting research on this obligate pathogen. In this paper, we report a new sequencing and assembling strategy for phytoplasma genome projects. This strategy involves differential centrifugation, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, whole genome amplification, shotgun sequencing, de novo assembly, screening of contigs from phytoplasma and the connection of phytoplasma contigs. Using this scheme, the WBD phytoplasma draft genome was obtained. It was comprised of six contigs with a total size of 611,462 bp, covering ∼94% of the chromosome. Five-hundred-twenty-five protein-coding genes, two operons for rRNA genes and 32 tRNA genes were identified. Comparative genome analyses between WBD phytoplasma and other phytoplasmas were subsequently carried out. The results showed that extensive arrangements and inversions existed among the WBD, OY-M and AY-WB phytoplasma genomes. Most protein-coding genes in WBD phytoplasma were found to be homologous to genes from other phytoplasmas; only 22 WBD-specific genes were identified. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that WBD phytoplasma had strongly reduced metabolic capabilities. However, 46 transporters were identified, which were involved with dipeptides/oligopeptides, spermidine/putrescine, cobalt and Mn/Zn transport, and so on. A total of 37 secreted proteins were encoded in the WBD phytoplasma chromosome and plasmids. Of these, three secreted proteins were similar to the reported phytoplasma virulence factors TENGU, SAP11 and SAP54. In addition, WBD phytoplasma possessed several proteins that were predicted to play a role in its adaptation to diverse environments. These results will provide clues for research on the pathogenic mechanisms of WBD phytoplasma and will also provide a perspective about the genome sequencing of other phytoplasmas and obligate organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2058619157,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common solid tumor worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer-related death. HCC is a particularly serious threat to the Chinese population. Although many molecular alterations are known to be involved in the tumorigenesis of hepatocytes, no systemic survey has examined the somatic mutations in HCC samples from Chinese patients. Our goal was to elucidate somatic mutations in Chinese HCC patients and investigate the possible molecular mechanisms involved in tumorigenesis.A total of 110 hepatitis B virus (HBV)-positive HCC samples and 46 HBV-negative HCC samples were genotyped for hot-spot mutations in the CSF1R, CTNNB1, KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, ERBB2, MET, PIK3CA, JAK1, and SMO genes. The transcriptomes of the CTNNB1 mutation-positive HCC samples from the HBV-positive patients (CB+ HCC) were compared to adjacent non-cancerous livers, and significantly altered genes were functionally validated in vitro.CTNNB1 mutations accounted for the majority of the mutations detected in our study. A slightly higher mutation rate was found in the HBV-positive patients than in their negative counterparts. A distinct pattern of CTNNB1 mutation was detected in these two populations, and drastic changes at the transcriptomic level were detected in the CB+ tumors compared to adjacent non-cancerous livers. Potential tumor suppressors (FoxA3 and Onecut1) and oncogenes (MAFG and SSX1) were functionally validated.Our work is the first systemic characterization of oncogenic mutations in HCC samples from Chinese patients. Targeting the Wnt-β-catenin pathway may represent a valid treatment option for Chinese HCC patients. Our work also suggests that targeting ONECUT1, FOXA3, SSX1, and MAFG may be a valid treatment option for CTNNB1 mutation positive HCC patients."
https://openalex.org/W2002502233,"Arsenic is a ubiquitous contaminant and a toxic metalloid which presents two main redox states in nature: arsenite [AsIII] and arsenate [AsV]. Arsenic resistance in Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 is mediated by the arsBHC operon and two additional arsenate reductases encoded by the arsI1 and arsI2 genes. Here we describe the genome-wide responses to the presence of arsenate and arsenite in wild type and mutants in the arsenic resistance system. Both forms of arsenic produced similar responses in the wild type strain, including induction of several stress related genes and repression of energy generation processes. These responses were transient in the wild type strain but maintained in time in an arsB mutant strain, which lacks the arsenite transporter. In contrast, the responses observed in a strain lacking all arsenate reductases were somewhat different and included lower induction of genes involved in metal homeostasis and Fe-S cluster biogenesis, suggesting that these two processes are targeted by arsenite in the wild type strain. Finally, analysis of the arsR mutant strain revealed that ArsR seems to only control 5 genes in the genome. Furthermore, the arsR mutant strain exhibited hypersentivity to nickel, copper and cadmium and this phenotype was suppressed by mutation in arsB but not in arsC gene suggesting that overexpression of arsB is detrimental in the presence of these metals in the media."
https://openalex.org/W2035940398,"Statins exert atheroprotective effects through the induction of specific transcriptional factors in multiple organs. In endothelial cells, statin-dependent atheroprotective gene up-regulation is mediated by Kruppel-like factor (KLF) family transcription factors. To dissect the mechanism of gene regulation, we sought to determine molecular targets by performing microarray analyses of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with pitavastatin, and KLF4 was determined to be the most highly induced gene. In addition, it was revealed that the atheroprotective genes induced with pitavastatin, such as nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3) and thrombomodulin (THBD), were suppressed by KLF4 knockdown. Myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) family activation is reported to be involved in pitavastatin-dependent KLF4 induction. We focused on MEF2C among the MEF2 family members and identified a novel functional MEF2C binding site 148 kb upstream of the KLF4 gene by chromatin immunoprecipitation along with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) followed by luciferase assay. By applying whole genome and quantitative chromatin conformation analysis {chromatin interaction analysis with paired end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET), and real time chromosome conformation capture (3C) assay}, we observed that the MEF2C-bound enhancer and transcription start site (TSS) of KLF4 came into closer spatial proximity by pitavastatin treatment. 3D-Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) imaging supported the conformational change in individual cells. Taken together, dynamic chromatin conformation change was shown to mediate pitavastatin-responsive gene induction in endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2065755148,"Fish cell cultures are becoming more widely used models for investigating molecular mechanisms of physiological response to environmental challenge. In this study, we derived two immortalized Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) cell lines from brain (OmB) and lip epithelium (OmL), and compared them to a previously immortalized bulbus arteriosus (TmB) cell line. The OmB and OmL cell lines were generated without or with Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibitor/3T3 feeder layer supplementation. Although both approaches were successful, ROCK inhibitor/feeder layer supplementation was found to offer the advantages of selecting for epithelial-like cell type and decreasing time to immortalization. After immortalization (≥ passage 5), we characterized the proteomes of the newly derived cell lines (OmB and OmL) using LCMS and identified several unique cell markers for each line. Subsequently, osmotolerance for each of the three cell lines following acute exposure to elevated sodium chloride was evaluated. The acute maximum osmotolerance of these tilapia cell lines (>700 mOsm/kg) was markedly higher than that of any other known vertebrate cell line, but was significantly higher in the epithelial-like OmL cell line. To validate the physiological relevance of these tilapia cell lines, we quantified the effects of acute hyperosmotic challenge (450 mOsm/kg and 700 mOsm/kg) on the transcriptional regulation of two enzymes involved in biosynthesis of the compatible organic osmolyte, myo-inositol. Both enzymes were found to be robustly upregulated in all three tilapia cell lines. Therefore, the newly established tilapia cells lines represent valuable tools for studying molecular mechanisms involved in the osmotic stress response of euryhaline fish."
https://openalex.org/W2087819495,"Alternative splicing of the oncogene MDM2 is a phenomenon that occurs in cells in response to genotoxic stress and is also a hallmark of several cancer types with important implications in carcinogenesis. However, the mechanisms regulating this splicing event remain unclear. Previously, we uncovered the importance of intron 11 in MDM2 that affects the splicing of a damage-responsive MDM2 minigene. Here, we have identified discrete cis regulatory elements within intron 11 and report the binding of FUBP1 (Far Upstream element-Binding Protein 1) to these elements and the role it plays in MDM2 splicing. Best known for its oncogenic role as a transcription factor in the context of c-MYC, FUBP1 was recently described as a splicing regulator with splicing repressive functions. In the case of MDM2, we describe FUBP1 as a positive splicing regulatory factor. We observed that blocking the function of FUBP1 in in vitro splicing reactions caused a decrease in splicing efficiency of the introns of the MDM2 minigene. Moreover, knockdown of FUBP1 in cells induced the formation of MDM2-ALT1, a stress-induced splice variant of MDM2, even under normal conditions. These results indicate that FUBP1 is also a strong positive splicing regulator that facilitates efficient splicing of the MDM2 pre-mRNA by binding its introns. These findings are the first report describing the regulation of alternative splicing of MDM2 mediated by the oncogenic factor FUBP1."
https://openalex.org/W2015644763,"During meiosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the HOP2 and MND1 genes are essential for recombination. A previous biochemical study has shown that budding yeast Hop2-Mnd1 stimulates the activity of the meiosis-specific strand exchange protein ScDmc1 only 3-fold, whereas analogous studies using mammalian homologs show >30-fold stimulation. The HOP2 gene was recently discovered to contain a second intron that lies near the 3′-end. We show that both HOP2 introns are efficiently spliced during meiosis, forming a predominant transcript that codes for a protein with a C-terminal sequence different from that of the previously studied version of the protein. Using the newly identified HOP2 open reading frame to direct synthesis of wild type Hop2 protein, we show that the Hop2-Mnd1 heterodimer stimulated Dmc1 D-loop activity up to 30-fold, similar to the activity of mammalian Hop2-Mnd1. ScHop2-Mnd1 stimulated ScDmc1 activity in the presence of physiological (micromolar) concentrations of Ca2+ ions, as long as Mg2+ was also present at physiological concentrations, leading us to hypothesize that ScDmc1 protomers bind both cations in the active Dmc1 filament. Co-factor requirements and order-of-addition experiments suggested that Hop2-Mnd1-mediated stimulation of Dmc1 involves a process that follows the formation of functional Dmc1-ssDNA filaments. In dramatic contrast to mammalian orthologs, the stimulatory activity of budding yeast Hop2-Mnd1 appeared to be specific to Dmc1; we observed no Hop2-Mnd1-mediated stimulation of the other budding yeast strand exchange protein Rad51.

Meiosis is a sexual reproduction pathway in which diploid cells undergo two specialized rounds of chromosome segregation to form haploids. Prior to the first round of meiotic chromosome segregation, homologous chromosomes are replicated and then undergo high levels of homologous recombination. Recombination involves the transfer and exchange of information between DNA molecules. Meiotic recombination is initiated by induction of programmed double-stranded breaks (DSBs), 2The abbreviations used are:DSBdouble-stranded breakD-loopdisplacement loopScSaccharomyces cerevisiae. which are formed by the transesterase activity of the Spo11 protein (1Keeney S.

Here we show that both HOP2 introns are efficiently spliced during meiosis, forming a transcript coding for a different C-terminal sequence than that characterized previously. We further show that the wild type ScHop2 protein, coded by three exons, as a component of the Hop2-Mnd1 heterodimer can dramatically enhance the D-loop activity of Dmc1. Additional characterization reveals similarities as well as a critical difference between the biochemical activity of budding yeast Hop2-Mnd1 and its mammalian counterparts.

The unreacted [γ-32P]ATP in the labeling reactions was removed by a Sephadex G25 microspin column (GE Healthcare), and residual T4 polynucleotide kinase was heat-inactivated.

Second, complementary DNA (cDNA) was generated by M-MLV reverse transcriptase using total RNA as template and oligo(dT)20 as primer by following a protocol provided by the enzyme vendor (Promega). Third, genomic DNA or total cDNA was used as template in PCR reactions with the primer pairs indicated in Fig. 1, B and C. The PCR-generated DNA products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose gel with standard 1× TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5) and 1 mm EDTA). The coding sequences (ORFs) of S. cerevisiae HOP2 and MND1 were sequentially inserted into the expression vector pETDuet-1 (Novagen). First, the ORF of HOP2 was amplified by RT-PCR from its mRNA (from yeast SK1 strain) and hexahistidine-tagged at its N terminus. The PCR-generated DNA fragment was inserted into the expression vector at restriction sites NcoI and HindIII to form the plasmid pETDuet-1-Hop2.

The resulting DNA fragment was inserted at the NdeI and XhoI sites of pETDuet-1-Hop2 to form the final expression plasmid pNRB662 (or pETDuet-1-ScHop2-Mnd1), which harbors both the HOP2 and the MND1 coding sequences, and confirmed by sequence analysis. S. cerevisiae Hop2 and Mnd1 proteins were coexpressed from pNRB662 in Escherichia coli cells Rosetta(DE3)pLysS using the T7 promoter system as described previously (5Cloud V. Chan Y.L. Grubb J.

In this system, only Hop2 is hexahistidine-tagged, and Mnd1 was co-purified through its interaction with Hop2. In brief, bacterial lysate with expressed Hop2-Mnd1 was prepared by French press and cleared by centrifugation. The Hop2-Mnd1 complex was then purified from the lysate in sequential steps by nickel resin (GE Healthcare) in batch followed by His-Trap FF in FPLC (GE Healthcare). The eluted protein fractions were pooled, concentrated by Centricon (Millipore), and exchanged into storage buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol (v/v)) by Sephadex G25 column.

When included, ScHop2-Mnd1 was preincubated with plasmid (in buffer without Ca2+ unless specified) at room temperature for 2 min prior to mixing with nucleoprotein filaments. The D-loop reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 μl of SDS (1% w/v) and proteinase K (1 mg/ml) followed by incubation at 37 °C for 5 min for deproteinization. The samples were analyzed by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel in 1× TAE buffer.

Properly targeted integrations were confirmed by PCR analysis and DNA sequencing. Details of strain construction are available upon request. Western blot detection was by anti-FLAG antibody following the standard protocol of the vendor (Sigma-Aldrich). The original characterization of the budding yeast HOP2 gene was complicated by three errors. First, the method used to map the 3′-end of HOP2 transcripts assumed that no second intron was present and, as a consequence, incorrectly assigned the Hop2 C-terminal sequence (Fig. 1A, SEQ i). Second, a frameshift sequencing error was present in the originally submitted sequence that became apparent when a number of additional sequences (Fig. 1A, SEQ ii) were submitted to the database. A third error occurred during the construction of a bacterial expression plasmid (pTFW515) designed to express SEQ ii, which lacks the third exon. Recent sequence analysis showed that pTFW515 carries a substitution mutation at the C-terminal sequence (Fig. 1A, SEQ iii). This mutation was not detected previously because the plasmid was generated as part of a large-scale subcloning project in which the sizes of inserted restriction fragments and induced proteins were used as quality controls rather than DNA sequencing (27Shih Y.P.

During efforts to correct the defect in pTFW515, it became clear that the protein corresponding to the open reading frame predicted from SEQ ii is highly toxic in E. coli. 4Y.-L. Chan and N. Handa, unpublished data. Thus, it is likely that the mutation carried by pTFW515 was selected, following transformation of a ligation mixture, because it directed expression of a less toxic form of the protein. pTFW515 was used for production of the Hop2-Mnd1 protein that was characterized in a previous study (14Chen Y.K.

However, this was practised without enough knowledge on the effect of cropping practices and environment on the biodiversity of AMF in olive orchards in Spain.Two culture-independent molecular methods were used to study the AMF communities associated with olive in a wide-region analysis in southern Spain including 96 olive locations. The use of T-RFLP and pyrosequencing analysis of rDNA sequences provided the first evidence of an effect of agronomic and climatic characteristics, and soil physicochemical properties on AMF community composition associated with olive. Thus, the factors most strongly associated to AMF distribution varied according to the technique but included among the studied agronomic characteristics the cultivar genotype and age of plantation and the irrigation regimen but not the orchard management system or presence of a cover crop to prevent soil erosion. Soil physicochemical properties and climatic characteristics most strongly associated to the AMF community composition included pH, textural components and nutrient contents of soil, and average evapotranspiration, rainfall and minimum temperature of the sampled locations. Pyrosequencing analysis revealed 33 AMF OTUs belonging to five families, with Archaeospora spp., Diversispora spp. and Paraglomus spp., being first records in olive. Interestingly, two of the most frequent OTUs included a diverse group of Claroideoglomeraceae and Glomeraceae sequences, not assigned to any known AMF species commonly used as inoculants in olive during nursery propagation.Our data suggests that AMF can exert higher host specificity in olive than previously thought, which may have important implications for redirecting the olive nursery process in the future as well as to take into consideration the specific soils and environments where the mycorrhized olive trees will be established."
https://openalex.org/W2035714681,"Two key events, namely adhesion and invasion, are pivotal to the occurrence of metastasis. Importantly, the 37 kDa/67 kDa laminin receptor (LRP/LR) has been implicated in enhancing these two events thus facilitating cancer progression. In the current study, the role of LRP/LR in the adhesion and invasion of liver cancer (HUH-7) and leukaemia (K562) cells was investigated. Flow cytometry revealed that the HUH-7 cells displayed significantly higher cell surface LRP/LR levels compared to the poorly-invasive breast cancer (MCF-7) control cells, whilst the K562 cells displayed significantly lower cell surface LRP/LR levels in comparison to the MCF-7 control cells. However, Western blotting and densitometric analysis revealed that all three tumorigenic cell lines did not differ significantly with regards to total LRP/LR levels. Furthermore, treatment of liver cancer cells with anti-LRP/LR specific antibody IgG1-iS18 (0.2 mg/ml) significantly reduced the adhesive potential of cells to laminin-1 and the invasive potential of cells through the ECM-like Matrigel, whilst leukaemia cells showed no significant differences in both instances. Additionally, Pearson's correlation coefficients suggested direct proportionality between cell surface LRP/LR levels and the adhesive and invasive potential of liver cancer and leukaemia cells. These findings suggest the potential use of anti-LRP/LR specific antibody IgG1-iS18 as an alternative therapeutic tool for metastatic liver cancer through impediment of the LRP/LR- laminin-1 interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1991378003,"Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) are ubiquitous and abundant and contribute significantly to the carbon and nitrogen cycles in the ocean. In this study, we assembled AOA draft genomes from two deep marine sediments from Donghae, South Korea, and Svalbard, Arctic region, by sequencing the enriched metagenomes. Three major microorganism clusters belonging to Thaumarchaeota, Epsilonproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria were deduced from their 16S rRNA genes, GC contents, and oligonucleotide frequencies. Three archaeal genomes were identified, two of which were distinct and were designated Ca. ""Nitrosopumilus koreensis"" AR1 and ""Nitrosopumilus sediminis"" AR2. AR1 and AR2 exhibited average nucleotide identities of 85.2% and 79.5% to N. maritimus, respectively. The AR1 and AR2 genomes contained genes pertaining to energy metabolism and carbon fixation as conserved in other AOA, but, conversely, had fewer heme-containing proteins and more copper-containing proteins than other AOA. Most of the distinctive AR1 and AR2 genes were located in genomic islands (GIs) that were not present in other AOA genomes or in a reference water-column metagenome from the Sargasso Sea. A putative gene cluster involved in urea utilization was found in the AR2 genome, but not the AR1 genome, suggesting niche specialization in marine AOA. Co-cultured bacterial genome analysis suggested that bacterial sulfur and nitrogen metabolism could be involved in interactions with AOA. Our results provide fundamental information concerning the metabolic potential of deep marine sedimentary AOA."

It can also cause taxonomic problems, especially in plant genera containing multiple species. In this study, the hybrid status of Melastoma affine, the most widespread taxon in this genus, and introgression between its putative parental species, M. candidum and M. sanguineum, were assessed on two sites, Hainan and Guangdong, using 13 SSR markers and sequences of a chloroplast intergenic spacer. Bayesian-based STRUCTURE analysis detected two most likely distinct clusters for the three taxa, and 76.0% and 73.9% of the morphologically identified individuals of M. candidum and M. sanguineum were correctly assigned, respectively. 74.5% of the M. affine individuals had a membership coefficient to either parental species between 0.1 and 0.9, suggesting admixture between M. candidum and M. sanguineum. Furthermore, NewHybrids analysis suggested that most individuals of M. affine were F2 hybrids or backcross hybrids to M. candidum, and that there was extensive introgression between M. candidum and M. sanguineum. These SSR data thus provides convincing evidence for hybrid origin of M. affine and extensive introgression between M. candidum and M. sanguineum. Chloroplast DNA results were consistent with this conclusion. Much higher hybrid frequency on the more disturbed Guangdong site suggests that human disturbance might offer suitable habitats for the survival of hybrids, a hypothesis that is in need of further testing."
https://openalex.org/W2094541086,"Haploinsufficiency or mutation of TBX1 is largely responsible for the etiology of physical malformations in individuals with velo-cardio-facial/DiGeorge syndrome (VCFS/DGS/22q11.2 deletion syndrome). TBX1 encodes a transcription factor protein that contains an evolutionarily conserved DNA binding domain termed the T-box that is shared with other family members. All T-box proteins, examined so far, bind to similar but not identical consensus DNA sequences, indicating that they have specific binding preferences. To identify the TBX1 specific consensus sequence, Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) was performed. In contrast to other TBX family members recognizing palindrome sequences, we found that TBX1 preferentially binds to a tandem repeat of 5'-AGGTGTGAAGGTGTGA-3'. We also identified a second consensus sequence comprised of a tandem repeat with a degenerated downstream site. We show that three known human disease-causing TBX1 missense mutations (F148Y, H194Q and G310S) do not alter nuclear localization, or disrupt binding to the tandem repeat consensus sequences, but they reduce transcriptional activity in cell culture reporter assays. To identify Tbx1-downstream genes, we performed an in silico genome wide analysis of potential cis-acting elements in DNA and found strong enrichment of genes required for developmental processes and transcriptional regulation. We found that TBX1 binds to 19 different loci in vitro, which may correspond to putative cis-acting binding sites. In situ hybridization coupled with luciferase gene reporter assays on three gene loci, Fgf8, Bmper, Otog-MyoD, show that these motifs are directly regulated by TBX1 in vitro. Collectively, the present studies establish new insights into molecular aspects of TBX1 binding to DNA. This work lays the groundwork for future in vivo studies, including chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next generation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to further elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of VCFS/DGS."

In this study we employed a mutational approach to define the nutrients and metabolic pathways required by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium during infection of a human epithelial cell line (HeLa). We deleted the key glycolytic genes, pfkA and pfkB to show that S. Typhimurium utilizes glycolysis for replication within HeLa cells; however, glycolysis was not absolutely essential for intracellular replication. Using S. Typhimurium strains deleted for genes encoding components of the phosphotransferase system and glucose transport, we show that glucose is a major substrate required for the intracellular replication of S. Typhimurium in HeLa cells. We also deleted genes encoding enzymes involved in the utilization of gluconeogenic substrates and the glyoxylate shunt and show that neither of these pathways were required for intracellular replication of S. Typhimurium within HeLa cells."
https://openalex.org/W2085921740,"Colpodellids are free-living, predatory flagellates, but their close relationship to photosynthetic chromerids and plastid-bearing apicomplexan parasites suggests they were ancestrally photosynthetic. Colpodellids may therefore retain a cryptic plastid, or they may have lost their plastids entirely, like the apicomplexan Cryptosporidium. To find out, we generated transcriptomic data from Voromonas pontica ATCC 50640 and searched for homologs of genes encoding proteins known to function in the apicoplast, the non-photosynthetic plastid of apicomplexans. We found candidate genes from multiple plastid-associated pathways including iron-sulfur cluster assembly, isoprenoid biosynthesis, and tetrapyrrole biosynthesis, along with a plastid-type phosphate transporter gene. Four of these sequences include the 5′ end of the coding region and are predicted to encode a signal peptide and a transit peptide-like region. This is highly suggestive of targeting to a cryptic plastid. We also performed a taxon-rich phylogenetic analysis of small subunit ribosomal RNA sequences from colpodellids and their relatives, which suggests that photosynthesis was lost more than once in colpodellids, and independently in V. pontica and apicomplexans. Colpodellids therefore represent a valuable source of comparative data for understanding the process of plastid reduction in humanity's most deadly parasite."
https://openalex.org/W2014461719,"In phytopathogenic fungi the establishment and maintenance of polarity is not only essential for vegetative growth and differentiation, but also for penetration and colonization of host tissues. We investigated orthologs of members of the yeast polarity complex in the grey mould fungus Botrytis cinerea: the scaffold proteins Bem1 and Far1, the GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor) Cdc24, and the formin Bni1 (named Sep1 in B. cinerea). BcBem1 does not play an important role in regular hyphal growth, but has significant impact on spore formation and germination, on the establishment of conidial anastomosis tubes (CATs) and on virulence. As in other fungi, BcBem1 interacts with the GEF BcCdc24 and the formin BcSep1, indicating that in B. cinerea the apical complex has a similar structure as in yeast. A functional analysis of BcCdc24 suggests that it is essential for growth, since it was not possible to obtain homokaryotic deletion mutants. Heterokaryons of Δcdc24 (supposed to exhibit reduced bccdc24 transcript levels) already show a strong phenotype: an inability to penetrate the host tissue, a significantly reduced growth rate and malformation of conidia, which tend to burst as observed for Δbcbem1. Also the formin BcSep1 has significant impact on hyphal growth and development, whereas the role of the putative ortholog of the yeast scaffold protein Far1 remains open: Δbcfar1 mutants have no obvious phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2041500522,"A rise in temperature will intensify the feeding links involving ectotherms in food webs. However, it is unclear how the effects will quantitatively differ between the plant-herbivore and herbivore-carnivore interface. To test how warming could differentially affect rates of herbivory and carnivory, we studied trophic interaction strength in a food chain comprised of green algae, herbivorous rotifers and carnivorous rotifers at 10, 15, 20 and 25°C. We found significant warming-induced changes in feeding by both herbivorous and carnivorous rotifers, but these responses occurred at different parts of the entire temperature gradient. The strongest response of the per capita herbivore's ingestion rate occurred due to an increase in temperature from 15 to 20°C (1.9 fold: from 834 to 1611 algal cells per h−1) and of the per capita carnivore's ingestion rate from 20 to 25°C (1.6 fold: from 1.5 to 2.5 prey h−1). Handling time, an important component of a consumer's functional response, significantly decreased from 15 to 20°C in herbivorous rotifers. In contrast, it decreased from 20 to 25°C in carnivorous rotifers. Attack rates significantly and strongly increased from 10 to 25°C in the herbivorous animals, but not at all in the carnivores. Our results exemplify how the relative forces of top-down control exerted by herbivores and carnivores may strongly shift under global warming. But warming, and its magnitude, are not the only issue: If our results would prove to be representative, shifts in ectotherm interactions will quantitatively differ when a 5°C increase starts out from a low, intermediate or high initial temperature. This would imply that warming could have different effects on the relative forces of carnivory and herbivory in habitats differing in average temperature, as would exist at different altitudes and latitudes."
https://openalex.org/W1997362287,"We derive the Iterative Confidence Enhancement of Tractography (ICE-T) framework to address the problem of path-length dependency (PLD), the streamline dispersivity confound inherent to probabilistic tractography methods. We show that PLD can arise as a non-linear effect, compounded by tissue complexity, and therefore cannot be handled using linear correction methods. ICE-T is an easy-to-implement framework that acts as a wrapper around most probabilistic streamline tractography methods, iteratively growing the tractography seed regions. Tract networks segmented with ICE-T can subsequently be delineated with a global threshold, even from a single-voxel seed. We investigated ICE-T performance using ex vivo pig-brain datasets where true positives were known via in vivo tracers, and applied the derived ICE-T parameters to a human in vivo dataset. We examined the parameter space of ICE-T: the number of streamlines emitted per voxel, and a threshold applied at each iteration. As few as 20 streamlines per seed-voxel, and a robust range of ICE-T thresholds, were shown to sufficiently segment the desired tract network. Outside this range, the tract network either approximated the complete white-matter compartment (too low threshold) or failed to propagate through complex regions (too high threshold). The parameters were shown to be generalizable across seed regions. With ICE-T, the degree of both near-seed flare due to false positives, and of distal false negatives, are decreased when compared with thresholded probabilistic tractography without ICE-T. Since ICE-T only addresses PLD, the degree of remaining false-positives and false-negatives will consequently be mainly attributable to the particular tractography method employed. Given the benefits offered by ICE-T, we would suggest that future studies consider this or a similar approach when using tractography to provide tract segmentations for tract based analysis, or for brain network analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2062207119,"Effective assessments of air-pollution exposure depend on the ability to accurately predict pollutant concentrations at unmonitored locations, which can be achieved through spatial interpolation. However, most interpolation approaches currently in use are based on the Euclidean distance, which cannot account for the complex nonlinear features displayed by air-pollution distributions in the wind-field. In this study, an interpolation method based on the shortest path distance is developed to characterize the impact of complex urban wind-field on the distribution of the particulate matter concentration. In this method, the wind-field is incorporated by first interpolating the observed wind-field from a meteorological-station network, then using this continuous wind-field to construct a cost surface based on Gaussian dispersion model and calculating the shortest wind-field path distances between locations, and finally replacing the Euclidean distances typically used in Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) with the shortest wind-field path distances. This proposed methodology is used to generate daily and hourly estimation surfaces for the particulate matter concentration in the urban area of Beijing in May 2013. This study demonstrates that wind-fields can be incorporated into an interpolation framework using the shortest wind-field path distance, which leads to a remarkable improvement in both the prediction accuracy and the visual reproduction of the wind-flow effect, both of which are of great importance for the assessment of the effects of pollutants on human health."
https://openalex.org/W2072186463,"Purpose To evaluate a simplified method to measure choroidal thickness (CT) using commercially available enhanced depth imaging (EDI) spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Methods We measured CT in 31 subjects without ocular diseases using Spectralis EDI SD-OCT. The choroid-scleral interface of the acquired images was first enhanced using a post-processing compensation algorithm. The enhanced images were then analysed using Photoshop. Two graders independently graded the images to assess inter-grader reliability. One grader re-graded the images after 2 weeks to determine intra-grader reliability. Statistical analysis was performed using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman plot analyses. Results Using adaptive compensation both the intra-grader reliability (ICC: 0.95 to 0.97) and inter-grader reliability (ICC: 0.93 to 0.97) were perfect for all five locations of CT. However, with the conventional technique of manual CT measurements using built-in callipers provided with the Heidelberg explorer software, the intra- (ICC: 0.87 to 0.94) and inter-grader reliability (ICC: 0.90 to 0.93) for all the measured locations is lower. Using adaptive compensation, the mean differences (95% limits of agreement) for intra- and inter-grader sub-foveal CT measurements were −1.3 (−3.33 to 30.8) µm and −1.2 (−36.6 to 34.2) µm, respectively. Conclusions The measurement of CT obtained from EDI SD-OCT using our simplified method was highly reliable and efficient. Our method is an easy and practical approach to improve the quality of choroidal images and the precision of CT measurement."
https://openalex.org/W1964195689,"The demographics of the southern bluefin tuna (SBT) Thunnus maccoyii spawning stock were examined through a large-scale monitoring program of the Indonesian longline catch on the spawning ground between 1995 and 2012. The size and age structure of the spawning population has undergone significant changes since monitoring began. There has been a reduction in the relative abundance of larger/older SBT in the catch since the early 2000s, and a corresponding decrease in mean length and age, but there was no evidence of a significant truncation of the age distribution. Pulses of young SBT appear in the catches in the early- and mid-2000s and may be the first evidence of increased recruitment into the spawning stock since 1995. Fish in these two recruitment pulses were spawned around 1991 and 1997. Size-related variations in sex ratio were also observed with female bias for fish less than 170 cm FL and male bias for fish greater than 170 cm FL. This trend of increasing proportion of males with size above 170 cm FL is likely to be related to sexual dimorphism in growth rates as male length-at-age is greater than that for females after age 10 years. Mean length-at-age of fish aged 8-10 years was greater for both males and females on the spawning ground than off the spawning ground, suggesting that size may be the dominant factor determining timing of maturation in SBT. In addition to these direct results, the data and samples from this program have been central to the assessment and management of this internationally harvested stock."
https://openalex.org/W1990054872,"Background Dietary long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation may be beneficial for chronic brain illnesses, but the issue is not agreed on. We examined effects of dietary n-3 PUFA deprivation or supplementation, compared with an n-3 PUFA adequate diet (containing alpha-linolenic acid [18:3 n-3] but not docosahexaenoic acid [DHA, 22:6n-3]), on brain markers of lipid metabolism and excitotoxicity, in rats treated chronically with NMDA or saline. Methods Male rats after weaning were maintained on one of three diets for 15 weeks. After 12 weeks, each diet group was injected i.p. daily with saline (1 ml/kg) or a subconvulsive dose of NMDA (25 mg/kg) for 3 additional weeks. Then, brain fatty acid concentrations and various markers of excitotoxicity and fatty acid metabolism were measured. Results Compared to the diet-adequate group, brain DHA concentration was reduced, while n-6 docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, 22:5n-6) concentration was increased in the n-3 deficient group; arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4n-6) concentration was unchanged. These concentrations were unaffected by fish oil supplementation. Chronic NMDA increased brain cPLA2 activity in each of the three groups, but n-3 PUFA deprivation or fish oil did not change cPLA2 activity or protein compared with the adequate group. sPLA2 expression was unchanged in the three conditions, whereas iPLA2 expression was reduced by deprivation but not changed by supplementation. BDNF protein was reduced by NMDA in N-3 PUFA deficient rats, but protein levels of IL-1β, NGF, and GFAP did not differ between groups. Conclusions N-3 PUFA deprivation significantly worsened several pathological NMDA-induced changes produced in diet adequate rats, whereas n-3 PUFA supplementation did not affect NMDA induced changes. Supplementation may not be critical for this measured neuropathology once the diet has an adequate n-3 PUFA content."

Cyclists were assigned to two interventions, either normoxic (N; n = 8; 150 mmHg PIO2) or hypoxic (H; n = 10; ∼3000 m, 100 mmHg PIO2) over a three week training (5×1 h-1h30.week−1) period. Prior to and after training, an incremental exercise test to exhaustion (EXT) was performed in normoxia together with a 2 min time trial (TT). Biopsy samples from the vastus lateralis were analyzed for MCT1 and MCT4 using immuno-blotting techniques. The peak power output (PPO) increased (p<0.05) after training (7.2% and 6.6% for N and H, respectively), but VO2max showed no significant change. The average power output in the TT improved significantly (7.3% and 6.4% for N and H, respectively). No differences were found in MCT1 and MCT4 protein content, before and after the training in either the N or H group. These results indicate there are no additional benefits of IHT when compared to similar normoxic training. Hence, the addition of the hypoxic stimulus on anaerobic performance or MCT expression after a three-week training period is ineffective."

Here we decipher mechanisms and pathways engaged by the pathogen to regulate VGCC expression in macrophages. We show that M. tb and its antigen Rv3416 use phospho-CREB (pCREB), Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), Protein Kinase C (PKC) and Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) to modulate VGCC expression in macrophages. siRNA mediated knockdown of MyD88, IRAK1, IRAK2 or TRAF6 significantly inhibited antigen mediated VGCC expression. Inhibiting Protein Kinase C (PKC) or MEK-ERK1/2 further increased VGCC expression. Interestingly, inhibiting intracellular calcium release upregulated antigen mediated VGCC expression, while inhibiting extracellular calcium influx had no significant effect. siRNA mediated knockdown of transcription factors c-Jun, SOX5 and CREB significantly inhibited Rv3416 mediated VGCC expression. A dynamic reciprocal cross-regulation between ROS and pCREB was observed that in turn governed VGCC expression with ROS playing a limiting role in the process. Further dissection of the mechanisms such as the interplay between ROS and pCREB would improve our understanding of the regulation of VGCC expression during M. tb infection."

https://openalex.org/W2029064897,"The development of antigen arrays has provided researchers with great tools to identify reactivities against self or foreign antigens from body fluids. Yet, these approaches mostly do not address antibody isotypes and their effector functions even though these are key points for a more detailed understanding of disease processes. Here, we present a bead array-based assay for a multiplexed determination of antigen-specific antibody levels in parallel with their properties for complement activation. We measured the deposition of C3 fragments from serum samples to reflect the degree of complement activation via all three complement activation pathways. We utilized the assay on a bead array containing native and citrullinated peptide antigens to investigate the levels of IgG, IgM and IgA autoantibodies along with their complement activating properties in serum samples of 41 rheumatoid arthritis patients and 40 controls. Our analysis revealed significantly higher IgG reactivity against the citrullinated fibrinogen β and filaggrin peptides as well as an IgA reactivity that was exclusive for citrullinated fibrinogen β peptide and C3 deposition in rheumatoid arthritis patients. In addition, we characterized the humoral immune response against the viral EBNA-1 antigen to demonstrate the applicability of this assay beyond autoimmune conditions. We observed that particular buffer compositions were demanded for separate measurement of antibody reactivity and complement activation, as detection of antigen-antibody complexes appeared to be masked due to C3 deposition. We also found that rheumatoid factors of IgM isotype altered C3 deposition and introduced false-positive reactivities against EBNA-1 antigen. In conclusion, the presented bead-based assay setup can be utilized to profile antibody reactivities and immune-complex induced complement activation in a high-throughput manner and could facilitate the understanding and diagnosis of several diseases where complement activation plays role in the pathomechanism."

https://openalex.org/W2036511124,"The transcription factor PROX1 (prospero homeobox 1) has a critical role in the development of various organs, and has been implicated in both oncogenic and tumor-suppressive functions in human cancers. However, the role of PROX1 in the development of renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) has not yet been studied. Here, we reported that PROX1 expression was decreased in human RCC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. In RCC tissues, however, poorly differentiated RCC expressed higher PROX1 levels compared with well-differentiated RCC. In addition, the PROX1 immunostaining levels were positively correlated with tumor nuclear grade and lymph node metastasis. Further, high PROX1 expression indicated poor survival for patients. These findings imply that in the different developmental stages of RCC, PROX1 may exert distinct functions according to the specific microenvironment of tumor. Moreover, in vitro experiments revealed that PROX1 overexpression enhanced the proliferation and migration of RCC cells; conversely, PROX1 depletion by siRNA attenuated the proliferation and migration of RCC cells. Collectively, these observations suggest that PROX1 plays an important role in RCC development and progression, and PROX1 may be a novel target for prevention and treatment of RCC."

Escherichia coli helicase II (UvrD) functions in methyl-directed mismatch repair, nucleotide excision repair, and homologous recombination. A previously discovered 2-amino acid substitution of residues 403 and 404 (both Asp → Ala) in the 2B subdomain of UvrD (uvrD303) confers an antimutator and UV-sensitive phenotype on cells expressing this allele. The purified protein exhibits a “hyper-helicase” unwinding activity in vitro. Using rapid quench, pre-steady state kinetic experiments we show the increased helicase activity of UvrD303 is due to an increase in the processivity of the unwinding reaction. We suggest that this mutation in the 2B subdomain results in a weakened interaction with the 1B subdomain, allowing the helicase to adopt a more open conformation. This is consistent with the idea that the 2B subdomain may have an autoregulatory role. The UvrD303 mutation may enable the helicase to unwind DNA via a “strand displacement” mechanism, which is similar to the mechanism used to processively translocate along single-stranded DNA, and the increased unwinding processivity may contribute directly to the antimutator phenotype.

In Escherichia coli, the product of the uvrD gene, DNA helicase II (UvrD), has been shown to function in two fundamental DNA repair processes: nucleotide excision repair (NER) (9Husain I.

Modrich P. DNA mismatch correction in a defined system.Science. 1989; 245: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). In NER, UvrD acts in conjunction with the UvrABC excision nuclease and DNA polymerase I to remove short 12–13-base oligonucleotides containing a wide variety of bulky lesions including pyrimidine dimers (9Husain I.

UvrD also participates in the MMR pathway by initiating unwinding at the nicked d(GATC) site created by MutH and displacing the nascent error-containing strand of DNA, which is degraded by exonucleases and subsequently resynthesized by DNA polymerase III (10Yamaguchi M.

UvrD has been suggested to have a role in other cellular processes, such as displacement of the RecA protein from ssDNA during conjugative recombination (13Centore R.C. Sandler S.J.

However, this role for UvrD is not as well understood. The uvrD gene encodes a 720-amino acid, 82-kDa Superfamily 1A (SF1A) helicase with well characterized 3′ to 5′ unwinding and translocase directionality. Consistent with other SF1 helicases, UvrD contains seven conserved motifs and two structural domains (1 and 2) each with two subdomains (A and B) (14Lee J.Y. Yang W.

Each protein is capable of adopting two conformations, open and closed, with the major difference between the two conformations being the orientation of the 2B subdomain. In the “open” form the 2B subdomain is stacked above the 2A subdomain and no contacts are made between the 2B and 1B subdomains. To adopt the alternate “closed” structure, the 2B subdomain rotates about a flexible hinge connected to the 2A subdomain and “closes” onto the 1B subdomain. The magnitude of the 2B subdomain rotation as the helicases modulate between the open and closed conformations has been reported to be 130° in Rep and 160° in UvrD. Although it is known that these SF1 helicases can adopt these alternate conformations, it is not clear why there are two alternate conformations. The related SF2 helicases (e.g. the hepatitis NS3 helicase) lack the equivalent of the 2B subdomain (23Yao N. Reichert P. Taremi S.S. Prosise W.W. Weber P.C.

Gauss G.H. Korolev S. Waksman G. Lohman T.M. The 2B domain of the Escherichia coli Rep protein is not required for DNA helicase activity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

U.S.A. 2005; 102: 10076-10081Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) have examined what role, if any, the 2B subdomain of Rep plays in the activity of this protein. It was concluded that the 2B subdomain is most likely a regulatory domain because deletion of this subdomain stimulates the unwinding and translocase activity of the protein in addition to activating the helicase activity of a RepΔ2B monomer. However, the role of the 2B subdomain in UvrD continues to be debated (14Lee J.Y. Yang W. UvrD helicase unwinds DNA one base pair at a time by a two-part power stroke.Cell. 2006; 127: 1349-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The two prevailing hypotheses suggest that either the 2B subdomain is required to make direct double-stranded DNA interactions, which allow the helicase to bind various substrates, or that the 2B subdomain functions in a regulatory role, modulating helicase activity. Direct studies of a corresponding deletion of the 2B subdomain in UvrD have not been reported due to the apparent lethality of the expression of UvrDΔ2B (25Cheng W. Brendza K.M. Gauss G.H. Korolev S. Waksman G. Lohman T.M. The 2B domain of the Escherichia coli Rep protein is not required for DNA helicase activity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16006-16011Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Previous work by Zhang et al. (27Zhang G. Deng E. Baugh L. Kushner S.R. Identification and characterization of Escherichia coli DNA helicase II mutants that exhibit increased unwinding efficiency.J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 377-387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) isolated an allele of uvrD that contained two point mutations within the 2B subdomain. In this mutant form of UvrD, named UvrD303, the native amino acids at positions 403 and 404 (both aspartic acids) were mutated to alanines (Fig. 1). When UvrD303 was expressed in place of the wild-type protein, from either the chromosome or a high copy number plasmid, cells exhibited antimutator, UV-sensitive and hypo-recombinant phenotypes (27Zhang G. Deng E. Baugh L. Kushner S.R. Identification and characterization of Escherichia coli DNA helicase II mutants that exhibit increased unwinding efficiency.J.

Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 1429-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). When purified and analyzed in vitro, UvrD303 exhibited a 10-fold increase in unwinding activity compared with its wild-type counterpart. This increased activity led to UvrD303 being referred to as a “hyper-helicase.” Interestingly, neither D403A nor D404A alone were sufficient to convey this hyper-helicase activity (27Zhang G. Deng E. Baugh L. Kushner S.R. Identification and characterization of Escherichia coli DNA helicase II mutants that exhibit increased unwinding efficiency.J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 377-387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This article presents a biochemical characterization of the UvrD303 mutant including a possible explanation for how the 2B subdomain mutation increases the unwinding activity of the helicase. Using single turnover rapid quench helicase assays, we have shown that the processivity of UvrD303, as a DNA helicase, is ∼10-fold higher than that of wild-type UvrD. We speculate that the mutation alters the ability of the 2B subdomain to properly adopt a closed conformation, as referred to above. The closed conformation appears to be important for normal endogenous helicase activity of wild-type UvrD as evidenced by the phenotype of cells expressing UvrD303. The uvrD gene was amplified via polymerase chain reaction from genomic K12 λ+ F+ DNA using the following primers: forward primer, 5′-CGGCGGTGCCATGGACG-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-TACCGACTCCAGCCGGGC-3′. The 5′ terminus of the reverse primer was phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase to facilitate blunt end ligation. The pTYB4-His vector was digested using the restriction enzymes NcoI and SmaI (New England Biolabs) and the resulting 7.5-kb DNA fragment was purified via agarose gel electrophoresis and excision of the DNA followed by use of a Qiagen quick spin purification column. The purified digested vector was treated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase to reduce the likelihood of vector re-ligation in subsequent cloning reactions. The uvrD containing PCR product was digested with the restriction enzyme NcoI and purified in a manner similar to the vector. The resultant digested vector and PCR insert were ligated using T4 ligase. Using this cloning technique, the SmaI site in pTYB4-His is destroyed, but will ensure that only a C-terminal glycine will be added to the protein after purification, yielding essentially native protein. This construct enabled the rapid purification of the helicase as previously described (29Tahmaseb K. Matson S.W. Rapid purification of helicase proteins and in vitro analysis of helicase activity.Methods. 2010; 51: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The uvrD303 allele was constructed using site-directed mutagenesis. A QuikChange PCR was performed using primers of the following sequence: forward, 5′-CTGATTGCCAACCGCAACGACGACGCGGCCTTTGAGCGTGTG-3′ and reverse, 5′-CACACGCTCAAAGGCCGCGTCGTCGTTGCGGTTGGCAATCAG-3′ to change the codons 403 and 404 from -GACGAC- to -GCGGCC-, converting both the aspartic acids to alanines. This mutagenesis also introduced a silent NotI restriction site that was used to screen potential clones for the uvrD303 allele. The resulting plasmid was sequenced to ensure no additional mutations had been introduced. The construct, pTYB4-UvrD303-His, was transformed into E. coli strain BL21DE3uvrD::Tn5mutL::Tn10 and a 20-ml culture was grown overnight at 37 °C in ZY media (30Studier F.W. Protein production by autoinduction in high-density shaking cultures.Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4109) Google Scholar). The overnight culture was introduced to 1 liters of ZYM5052 autoinduction media (30Studier F.W. Protein production by autoinduction in high-density shaking cultures.Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4109) Google Scholar) and grown at 16 °C for 48 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with 25 ml of STE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 100 mm NaCl), and harvested again by centrifugation. The cells were stored at −80 °C until use. The cells were lysed and the protein was purified as previously described using a combination of Talon (Clontech) and Chitin (New England Biolabs) resins to take advantage of the two affinity tags present on the overexpressed fusion protein (29Tahmaseb K. Matson S.W. Rapid purification of helicase proteins and in vitro analysis of helicase activity.Methods. 2010; 51: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Protein that eluted from the Chitin column was dialyzed against UvrD storage buffer (31Runyon G.T. Wong I. Lohman T.M. Overexpression, purification, DNA binding and dimerization of the Esherichia coli uvrD gene product (helicase II).Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 602-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and stored at −20 °C. The purified protein was greater than 95% homogeneous as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS. Wild-type UvrD was purified as previously described (31Runyon G.T. Wong I. Lohman T.M. Overexpression, purification, DNA binding and dimerization of the Esherichia coli uvrD gene product (helicase II).Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 602-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Partial duplex substrates were prepared by radiolabeling the 5′-end of oligonucleotides obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, Iowa) using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (see Table 1 for sequences). A 1.1-fold excess of an unlabeled complementary oligonucleotide was annealed to the labeled strand by heating the two strands to 95 °C for 5 min and allowing them to slow cool to 25 °C overnight. The partial duplex substrate was purified from free nucleotide using a Sephadex G50 spin column and dialyzed into TEN buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl). This process was used to generate the 24/64 and 90/130 partial duplex substrates. In each case the shorter DNA strand was radioactively labeled. The longer DNA strand contains a 40-base 3′-ssDNA tail to facilitate loading of UvrD.TABLE 1OligonucleotidesOligonucleotide sequenceRQ24: 5′-GCCCTGCTGCCGACCAACGAAGGT-3′RQ64: 5′-ACCTTCGTTGGTCGGCAGCAGGGC (T40)-3′RQ90: 5′-GCCCTGCTGCCGACCAACGAAGGTTACATTCCCCGTGCTGGCCGT TTG CGGTTGTCCTGTACCACTCGAAGTAGGAGGGGTGCTCACCGA-3′RQ130: 5′-TCGGTGAGCACCCCTCCTACTTCGAGTGGTACAGGACAACCGCAA ACGGCCAGCACGGGGAATGTAACCTTCGTTGGTCGGCAGCAGGGC (T40)-3′Hairpin trap: 5′-CCTCGCTGCTTTTTGCAGCGAGGC (T30)-3′Fluorescence anisotropy labeled: 5′-TATCGGCACGTCTCGAGATG-Cy5-3′Fluorescence anisotropy 40b tail: 5′-CATCTCGAGACGTGCCGATA (T40)-3′ Open table in a new tab The 243-bp partial duplex substrate was generated from a modified version of pUC19, pUC19-TS. The pUC19-TS construct was created by digesting pUC19 DNA (New England Biolabs) with BamHI and EcoRI. The insert was created by annealing the following synthetic oligonucleotides: 5′-AATTCCTCAGCAATCCTCAGCCAGGCCTCAGCTGGCCTCAGCG-3′ and 5′-GATCCGCTGAGGCCAGCTGAGGCCTGGCTGAGGATTGCTGAGG-3′. The annealing reaction created compatible ends with the BamHI- and EcoRI-digested pUC19 vector. This elongated version of pUC19 was then used in a site-directed mutagenic PCR (with the following primers: forward, 5′-GGATCCTCAGCAGTCGACCTCAGCGCATGC-3′ and reverse, 5′-GCATGCGCTGAGGTCGACTGCTGAGGATCC-3′ to create pUC19-TS, which contains a 67-bp stretch of DNA between the EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites (5′-CCTCAGCAATCCTCAGCCAGGCCTCAGCTGGCCTCAGCGGATCCTCAGCAGTCGACCTCAGCGCATG-3′) containing multiple Nt.BbvC1 nicking sites. To produce the 243-bp partial duplex substrate 50 pmol of plasmid DNA were digested with EcoRI and SapI to completion to produce a 297-bp DNA fragment. The enzymes were heat killed at 65 °C for 20 min and the resulting DNA was purified by gel extraction using a 1.5% (w/v) (0.75% (w/v) agarose, 0.75% (w/v) low melting agarose) agarose gel. The three-nucleotide overhang generated by the SapI digest was filled in using Klenow fragment polymerase and [α-32P]dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP. The fill-in reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The purified DNA fragment, which contains seven Nt.BbvCI nickase sites (CCTCAGC), was nicked with Nt.BbvCI followed by heating to 80 °C for 20 min to denature the on average 11 nucleotide fragments generated by the nicking reaction. The resulting DNA molecule contains a 45-base 3′-ssDNA tail preceding a 243-bp duplex region. The nicked DNA was immediately applied to Qiagen QIAquick PCR Purification spin columns for purification (1 column used per 8 pmol of DNA) and eluted in TEN buffer. The final DNA concentration was determined by scintillation counting. The standard reaction mixture (40 μl) contained 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 3 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 μg/ml of bovine serum albumin, 10 ng/μl of M13 ssDNA, [α-32P]ATP (∼60 nCi/μl), and 10 nm UvrD or UvrD303 helicase. For kcat determinations the ATP concentration was 400 μm. For Km determinations the ATP concentration ranged from 50 to 500 μm. All reagents except ATP were mixed and allowed to incubate on ice for 5 min. Then ATP was added and the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Aliquots (5 μl) were removed every 2 min and 2 μl of 5 m formic acid was added to stop the reaction. 2.5 μl of this mixture was spotted onto a thin layer chromatography plate and developed in a 0.45 m ammonium sulfate solution. Results were visualized by PhosphorImaging (GE Healthcare). Helicase reaction mixtures (16 μl) for steady-state experiments contained 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 3 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 μg/ml of bovine serum albumin, 3 mm ATP, helicase concentration as described, and ∼0.2 nm radiolabeled partial duplex DNA substrate. The reactions were assembled on ice, and the helicase was allowed to preincubate with the DNA substrate for several minutes. The reactions were initiated by the addition of ATP and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min before addition of 8 μl of stop solution, 37.5% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm EDTA, 0.3% (w/v) SDS, 0.5× TBE and dyes. The reactions were resolved on 12% (w/v) or 8% (w/v) non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels (19:1 cross-linking ratio), or 3% (w/v) NuSieveTM agarose gels depending on substrate size and visualized by PhosphorImaging (GE Healthcare). Rapid quench single turnover assays were performed essentially as previously described (32Ali J.A. Maluf N.K. Lohman T.M. An oligomeric form of E. coli UvrD is required for optimal helicase activity.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 815-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), with minor modifications, at room temperature (∼19 °C) using a computer controlled quenched-flow apparatus (KinTek RQF-3, University Park, PA). Helicase was allowed to incubate with the partial duplex substrate (100 nm helicase, 2 nm DNA substrate) in buffer L (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 μg/ml of bovine serum albumin, 200 μm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) plus 3 mm ATP on ice for 15 min and then loaded into the D loop. The opposite E loop was loaded with 6 mm MgCl2 and 3 μm DNA hairpin trap in buffer M (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 25 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). Reactions were initiated by rapidly mixing equal volume aliquots of the solutions from loops D and E, and were quenched with 200 mm EDTA and 0.2% (w/v) SDS. Samples were resolved on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels or 3% (w/v) NuSieve-agarose gels as described above and visualized by PhosphorImaging (GE Healthcare). The modeled unwinding curves were fit to the data collected with each partial duplex DNA substrate using a linear regression model and the kinetic simulator Tenua (Bililite). Using the previously published step size as a starting reference, the pre-steady state kinetics were modeled using the n-step kinetic scheme (see Scheme 1). The modeled data were compared with the collected data by calculating the residuals for each collected data point at the corresponding point generated by the model. The number of steps, knp, kd, and ku, were manually adjusted until a best fit was obtained. The fits that produced the smallest residuals compared with model were defined as best fits. The modeled curves were visually inspected to ensure the quality of the fit. The data for each substrate length was analyzed in this manner and best fits were calculated (see Fig. 5).FIGURE 5Modeled kinetics of UvrD303 helicase activity.

The uvrD303 allele, containing amino acid substitutions at positions 403 and 404 (D403A, D404A), was originally isolated by Kushner and colleagues (27Zhang G. Deng E. Baugh L. Kushner S.R. Identification and characterization of Escherichia coli DNA helicase II mutants that exhibit increased unwinding efficiency.J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 377-387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in a screen for mutations in regions outside the conserved helicase motifs that impact biological function. Cells expressing this mutant form of UvrD from a plasmid exhibit increased sensitivity to ultraviolet light and methyl methanesulfonate as do cells containing a deletion of the uvrD gene. Interestingly, cells expressing uvrD303 also exhibit an antimutator phenotype (27Zhang G. Deng E. Baugh L. Kushner S.R.

To date, the impact of subtle alternative splicing phenomena on protein biosynthesis has been studied in frame-preserving incidents. On the contrary, mRNA isoforms derived from frame-shifting events were poorly studied and generally characterized as non-coding. This work provides evidence for a frame-shifting subtle alternative splicing event which results in the production of a novel protein isoform. We applied a combined molecular approach for the cloning and expression analysis of a human RNase κ transcript (RNase κ-02) which lacks four consecutive bases compared to the previously isolated RNase κ isoform. RNase κ-02 mRNA is expressed in all human cell lines tested end encodes the synthesis of a 134-amino-acid protein by utilizing an alternative initiation codon. The expression of RNase κ-02 in the cytoplasm of human cells was verified by Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis using a specific polyclonal antibody developed on the basis of the amino-acid sequence difference between the two protein isoforms. The results presented here show that subtle changes during mRNA splicing can lead to the expression of significantly altered protein isoforms."
https://openalex.org/W2035426453,"The PilE pilin subunit protein of the gonococcal Type IV pilus (Tfp) colonization factor undergoes multisite, covalent modification with the zwitterionic phospho-form modification phosphoethanolamine (PE). In a mutant lacking the pilin-like PilV protein however, PilE is modified with a mixture of PE and phosphocholine (PC). Moreover, intrastrain variation of PilE PC modification levels have been observed in backgrounds that constitutively express PptA (the protein phospho-form transferase A) required for both PE and PC modification. The molecular basis underlying phospho-form microheterogeneity in these instances remains poorly defined. Here, we examined the effects of mutations at numerous loci that disrupt or perturb Tfp assembly and observed that these mutants phenocopy the pilV mutant vis a vis phospho-form modification status. Thus, PC modification appears to be directly or indirectly responsive to the efficacy of pilin subunit interactions. Despite the complexity of contributing factors identified here, the data favor a model in which increased retention in the inner membrane may act as a key signal in altering phospho-form modification. These results also provide an alternative explanation for the variation in PilE PC levels observed previously and that has been assumed to be due to phase variation of pptA. Moreover, mass spectrometry revealed evidence for mono- and di-methylated forms of PE attached to PilE in mutants deficient in pilus assembly, directly implicating a methyltransferase-based pathway for PC synthesis in N. gonorrhoeae."
https://openalex.org/W2035970960,"The development and verification of HIV-2 assays depends in part on the availability of well-characterized samples, including those from reagent repositories. During the development of an HIV-2 RNA quantification assay, two HIV-2 viral isolates (CDC 301340 and CDC 301342) obtained from the NIAID AIDS Reagent and Reference Repository were not detected leading to an investigation. Two HIV-2 primers/probe sets of known performance in real-time viral RNA quantification assays, targeting different regions of the virus, also failed to generate RT-PCR products for these two isolates. These isolates were tested in the HIV-1 specific COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Test v2.0 (Roche Molecular Diagnostics) and were quantified at high copy number. Other HIV-2 isolates tested were not amplified in the COBAS HIV-1 TaqMan assay. Furthermore, the discrepant isolates were highly reactive in an HIV-1 p24 antigen test while the other HIV-2 isolates showed very weak, if any, cross-reactivity with the HIV-1 p24 assay. Phylogenetic tree analysis of sequences from the protease-reverse transcriptase regions of the discrepant HIV-2 isolates mapped with HIV-1 Group M, Subtype CRF02_AG confirming these isolates were of HIV-1 origin and had been misclassified as HIV-2. The use of misclassified isolates in the verification of molecular and immunological assays can lead to misinterpretation of test results, misdirection of efforts into assay redesign and increased development costs. The results of this study were shared with the NIAID AIDS Reagent Program, leading to the reclassification of the two discrepant isolates as HIV-1."
