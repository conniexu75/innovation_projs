https://openalex.org/W1981245669,"The esterolytic enzyme phospholipase A2 specifically splits the 2-acyl linkage of phosphoglycerides1 in a calcium-dependent reaction. In the pancreas the enzyme occurs as a zymogen which is activated on secretion into the duodenal tract by the removal of seven amino acid residues from the N terminus by trypsin2,3. Having refined our X-ray analysis of the crystal structure of bovine pancreatic phospholipase A2 from 2.4 Å (ref. 4) to 1.7 Å resolution5, we now describe how the structure of the molecule may account for the specificity of the enzyme and for the sudden and dramatic change in activity when the substrate concentration passes the critical micelle concentration6."

https://openalex.org/W1556174679,"Abstract The enzyme responsible for the respiratory burst in human neutrophils is a membrane-bound oxidase that catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to O2- at the expense of a reduced pyridine nucleotide. We describe further properties of the solubilized oxidase. The rates of O2- production and NADPH consumption are consistent with the stoichiometry: 2 O2 + NADPH leads to 2 O2- + NADP The enzyme is highly specific for oxygen, failing to reduce several artificial electron acceptors including ferricyanide. FAD, an essential cofactor, binds tightly to the enzyme, as indicated by a Km of 61 nM. A requirement for a free --SH group is suggested by a 2-fold increase in activity in the presence of low concentrations of dithiothreitol; the higher dithiothreitol concentrations lead to inhibition. The solubilized enzyme is highly unstable, losing one-half its activity after 1 h at room temperature. Loss of activity is accelerated 2- to 3-fold by salts and EDTA. The substrate analog 2',5'-ADP is similar to other salts in its effect on the inactivation rate. ATP, on the other hand, causes loss of activity in seconds, raising the possibility that ATP is a physiological regulator of the catalytic activity of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1504314697,"Very low density lipoproteins and low density lipoproteins attain maximal cholesteryl ester contents during the incubation of human plasma and, under these conditions, both lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase and transfer proteins are inhibited. These lipoproteins provide the major part of free cholesterol for the lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase reaction, and are the major acceptors of cholesteryl ester generated by lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase and transported to the lipoprotein acceptors by the transfer protein. The results obtained indicate that the concentration of acceptor limits esterification and transfer in plasma, and that in vivo these acceptors contain close to their maximal cholesteryl ester content. Human plasma end product acceptor lipoproteins have a composition similar to that of the ester-rich large low density lipoprotein characteristic of primate models of experimental atherosclerosis."

https://openalex.org/W1515731319,"Epinephrine or prostaglandin E1 pretreatment of intact S-49 lymphoma cells specifically desensitized adenylate cyclase activity. Cholate extracts of membranes from these desensitized cells showed no difference from controls in their reconstitution of hormone-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in the adenylate cyclase-deficient variant (cyc-) of the lymphoma cell line. Adenylate cyclase in the cyc- variant was also specifically desensitized by epinephrine in prostaglandin E1. The desensitization was assessed by reconstituting the cyc- adenylate cyclase with cholate extracts of the wild type lymphoma cells. Since the cyc- has been shown to lack the coupling or G/F proteins of the adenylate cyclase complex, and these proteins are restored by cholate extracts from wild type cells, we conclude that the G/F proteins are not altered or necessary for specific desensitization of the lymphoma cell lines."

https://openalex.org/W1518710151,"The results presented demonstrate that erythropoiesis in the mouse spleen was associated with cyclic changes in cholesterol and dolichol synthesis which were independent of each other. Changes in the rate of cholesterol synthesis were correlated with the level of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity and with the rate of cell division (thymidine incorporation into DNA), but a cycle of dolichol synthesis appeared to be independent of both these parameters. Consequently the incorporation of [14C]acetate into dolichol increased 20- to 30-fold compared to the rate of cholesterol synthesis 5 to 6 days following phenylhydrazine treatment. The pathway for dolichol synthesis branches from that leading to cholesterol at the level of the intermediate farnesyl pyrophosphate, subsequent to the reaction catalyzed by the regulatory enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase. Previous studies showed that in several cell culture lines, and in liver, dolichol synthesis and cholesterol synthesis are regulated in a coordinated way by reductase activity. However, during the process of spermatogenesis and in developing mouse brain the regulation of dolichol synthesis appeared to be independent of cholesterol synthesis. Independent regulation of dolichol synthesis is now demonstrated in a third differentiating tissue, the erythropoietic spleen, and the results suggest that a cycle of dolichol synthesis is specifically associated with one or more stages of erythroid differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1525111621,"Equilibrium dialysis studies on the binding of the Dolichos biflorus lectin with [14C]methyl alpha-D-GalNAc showed that the lectin has two combining sites/molecule and an intrinsic association constant at 3 degrees C of 4.2 X 10(3) liters mol-1. Binding studies on individual fractions (II, IV, and VII) of the lectin that differ in their chromatographic properties on concanavalin A-Sepharose gave association constants for methyl alpha-D-GalNAc of 2.2 X 10(3) liters mol-1, 3.2 X 10(3) liters mol-1, and 3.2 X 10(3) liters mol-1, respectively. Molecular exclusion chromatography of iodinated Subunits I and II of the lectin, as well as sedimentation velocity studies of the noniodinated subunits, showed that the isolated subunits form aggregates in aqueous solution. Aggregates of subunit I were capable of agglutinating blood type A erythrocytes, precipitating blood group A + H substance, and binding to blood group A + H substance in an affinity electrophoretic system. Aggregates of subunit II exhibited none of these binding properties and did not inhibit the ability of the intact lectin to agglutinate type A erythrocytes. Affinity electrophoresis of subunit I showed that it has an association constant for N-acetyl-D-galactosamine similar to that of the intact lectin. The results suggest that it is subunit I that is primarily responsible for the carbohydrate binding properties of the lectin."

N. P., Seavey, B. K. and Lewis, U. J. (1974) Endocrinol. Res. Commun. 1, 449-464). This material, designated 20K hGH, occurs in various forms with the majority present as a heterologous dimer of Mr = 20,000 hGH and hGH. The purification scheme for obtaining the variant from these fractions is described. Analysis of Mr = 20,000 hGH in the sequenator has confirmed that residues 32-46 of hGH are absent in Mr = 20,000 hGH. The structures of hGH and Mr = 20,000 hGH have been compared by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, circular dichroism, spectrophotometric titration, and nitration of the tyrosine residues by tetranitromethane. The results indicate that the folding of the polypeptide chain of the two proteins is similar but not identical."
https://openalex.org/W1564308792,"The physical characteristics and sequence content of polyadenylated and nonpolyadenylated messenger RNAs were determined in total and polysomal RNAs isolated from cotton cotyledons after 24 h of germination. RNAs were fractionated on the basis of their poly(A) content by passage through poly(U)-agarose. The mass average size of poly(A) is 112 +/- 4 nucleotides in total RNA and 81 +/- 3 nucleotides in polysomal RNA. Less than 2% of the poly(A) tracts are between 5-15 nucleotides in length. The mass average length of recovered polyadenylated mRNAs from either RNA is 1600 nucleotides. In vitro translation of the RNAs in the wheat germ system and hybridization of the RNAs with complementary DNAs confirmed the physical estimates of their absolute amounts. About 3.3% of the high molecular weight RNA in the tissue is mRNA, of which 40% is on polysomes. Abut 45% of the polysomal mRNA and 75% of the nonpolysomal mRNA is polyadenylated. These mRNAs are transcribed from nonrepetitive DNA. Both techniques unambiguously demonstrate that all mRNA populations contain the same sequences in about the same relative concentration. At this point of development in this tissue, differential polyadenylation or entry into polysomes cannot be specific for particular mRNA sequences."

https://openalex.org/W1533033957,"Bovine serum albumin was modified with 2-imino-2-methoxyethyl 1-thioglycopyranosides of galactose and glucose (Gal-AI-BSA, Glc-AI-BSA, respectively). Both types of neoglycoproteins were taken up by isolated rat hepatocytes. Gal-AI-BSA and Glc-AI-BSA inhibited the uptake of each other, and also inhibited the uptake of asialo-orosomucoid as expected from the results obtained with rabbit liver membranes (Stowell, C. P., and Lee, Y. C. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 6107-6110). Gal-neoglycoproteins of bovine serum albumin containing other linking groups between the galactose moiety and protein were found to be as effective in inhibition of the uptake of asialo-orosomucoid as Gal-AI-BSA, indicating that the method of carbohydrate attachment had little influence on endocytosis of galactose-terminated neoglycoproteins. In contrast, comparable Glc-neoglycoproteins (other than Glc-AI-BSA) were weak inhibitors. It thus appears that the positively charged amidino group present in Glc-AI-BSA contributes to the uptake of this neoglycoprotein by rat hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1557138612,"The pH-dependent dissociation of porcine heart mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (L-malate:NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.37) has been more extensively characterized. The native, dimeric form of the enzyme (Mr = 70,000) which exists at pH 7.5 has previously been shown to dissociate into its constituent subunits (Mr = 35,000) at pH 5.0 (Bleile, D. M., Schulz, R. A., Gregory, E. M., and Harrison, J. H. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 755-758). The dissociation is accompanied by a concomitant decrease in enzymatic specific activity and an increase in intrinsic protein fluorescence. By using the characteristics of specific activity and intrinsic protein fluorescence as probes of dimerization, the kinetics of subunit reassociation was investigated. In order to facilitate reassociation, a pH jump method was utilized in which enzyme at pH 5.0 was diluted into a large excess of pH 7.5 buffer. The regain of enzymatic specific activity and the decrease in protein fluorescence were observed to follow first order kinetics. The rate constant in both cases was dependent upon the protein concentration, and in all cases, full recovery of either enzymatic activity or native protein fluorescence was obtained. The Arrhenius activation energy for the reassociation of the subunits was found to be approximately 20 kcal/mol, an observation which is consistent with a refolding process whose rate-limiting step may be the cis/trans-isomerization about one or more proline imino bonds. A model for subunit reassociation which is consistent with the kinetic data is proposed."

https://openalex.org/W1542054541,"We have used the fluorescence-activated cell sorter to measure the metabolism of the carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, benzo(a)pyrene (BP), in individual, viable mouse hepatoma (Hepa 1c1c7) cells and to physically select variants with either markedly elevated or markedly decreased ability to metabolize to low, nontoxic concentrations of BP (25 nM) and measuring the rate of disappearance of BP fluorescence. We show by several criteria that the disappearance of BP fluorescence is due to the metabolism of the carcinogen. Cells sorted according to their rae of loss of BP fluorescence exhibit the predicted phenotypes in BP-metabolizing activity, as measured by the aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase assay."

https://openalex.org/W1540146572,"Porcine heart mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (L-malate:NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.37) has been immobilized by covalent attachment to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B-Cl gel. The gel was activated with low levels of CNBr to produce a low density of linkage sites and, hence, to facilitate linkage of the enzyme through a single subunit. Matrix-bound mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase was found to possess 50-65% of the native mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase specific activity when assayed in the NAD+ leads to NADH direction but only 5-15% of the native enzyme specific activity when assayed in the NADH leads to NAD+ direction. MB-dimeric mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase was dissociated to MB-monomer by exposure to pH 5.0 buffer. The MB-monomer was found to be catalytically active, possessing only a slightly decreased specific activity when compared to MB-dimer. The reconstitution of Mb-monomer to MB-dimer was accomplished by adding dissociated mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase, which exists at pH 5.0, to MB-monomer and adjusting to pH 7.5. The kinetic parameters, pH activity profile, and stability toward heat denaturation for MB-mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (monomer and dimer) were determined and compared to native mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase. MB-mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase exhibited enhanced stability and similar pH activity profiles when compared to native mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase. Immobilization of mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase altered the enzyme's kinetic parameters in such a manner as to increase the values of Km for the substrates and decrease the values of Vmax."

https://openalex.org/W1504539812,"Average rates of polypeptide chain elongation have been determined in cockerel liver explants on 4 successive days following an in vivo injection of 17 beta-estradiol. Incorporation of [3H]leucine by the explants is linear for at least 24 h, and the rate of protein synthesis increases significantly after estrogen injection. The explants synthesize and secrete serum albumin. B-apolipoprotein, and the phosphoprotein vitellogenin at relative rates which are similar to those reported for liver in vivo. Using this system, changes in the average rates of polypeptide chain elongation have been analyzed as a temporal sequence following a single injection of 17 beta-estradiol into cockerels. For this, average ribosome half-transit times were determined by measuring the kinetics of transfer of labeled polypeptides from polysomal-bound to released polypeptides. The data revealed a dramatic effect of estradiol on the average ribosome half-transit time with a maximum increase of 4.6-fold; however, the average size of polypeptides synthesized by explants at the peak of induction increased only 15% when compared to uninduced liver explants. These findings indicate that injection of estradiol results in large changes in the actual rates at which amino acids are added to the growing nascent polypeptide chain; that is, rates of polypeptide chain elongation. Therefore, translation-level regulation of protein synthesis in cockerel livers plays a significant part in determining the magnitude of the response to hormone stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1911522206,"Polyadenylated RNA prepared from pituitary glands of ovariectomized rats was translated in heterologous cell-free systems derived from wheat germ and rabbit reticulocytes in the absence and in the presence of pancreatic microsomal membranes. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that the major 14,000-dalton product immunoprecipitated by antisera to the alpha subunit of rat and bovine luteinizing hormone from membrane-free translations was processed to a major 21,000-dalton and a minor 17,000-dalton product in the presence of microsomal membranes. These membrane-dependent products were sensitive to cleavage by the glycosidase endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, but the 14,000-dalton product was resistant. The 21,000-dalton product was sequestered within the microsomal vesicles as shown by its resistance to limited proteolysis capable of digesting the 14,000-dalton precursor. Glycosylated products with apparent Mr = 18,000 and 17,000 were identified from membrane-supplemented translations by immunoprecipitation using antisera to the beta subunit of rat luteinizing hormone. The immunological identity of the glycosylated subunits of luteinizing hormone was confirmed by showing competition of the immunoprecipitation reactions with unlabeled subunits."

https://openalex.org/W1662471030,"We have examined the gel profiles of staphylococcal nuclease digests of intact nuclei following different extents of removal of histone H1 by low pH. It was found that the submonomer fragment pattern (i.e. fragments less than 140 base pairs (bp) changed dramatically following removal of H1. The most striking feature of this change was a marked increase in the relative intensity of a band migrating at 102 +/- 4 bp when about 20-50% of the nuclear DNA is rendered acid soluble. All other submonomer bands decreased in relative intensity. There was no evidence for an approximately 100-bp repeat pattern accompanying the enhanced generation of the 102-bp fragment following H1 removal. This result, along with the comparisons of gel profiles for different extents of digestion, suggests that removal of histone H1 from nuclei results in an increased susceptibility of the DNA to staphylococcal nuclease at one or both ends of many of the core particles and that a strong block to further digestion occurs within these core particles resulting in the formation of a relatively stable 102-bp fragment."

https://openalex.org/W1505340574,"Parathyroid secretory protein (PSP) was purified from extracts of bovine parathyroid glands using radioactive PSP as a marker during purification. The labeled preparation was obtained by gel filtration of medium resulting from incubation of parathyroid glands with radioactive amino acids for 4 h. Alkaline extraction, ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, and gel filtration over Bio-Gel A 1.5 M and A 5 M resulted in a homogeneous product. Purified PSP monomer had a Mr = 67,000, was highly acidic on gel electrophoresis, and contained over 35% glutamic and aspartic acid residues. Approximately 18% of the protein consisted of carbohydrate residues. The homogeneity of the final product was established by polyacrylamide and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gel electrophoresis and the identification of a single NH2-terminal leucine. A radioimmunoassay for PSP was developed to identify the protein in tissue extracts and in incubation medium. Purification of PSP should be useful in defining further its biochemistry, biologic function, and control of secretion."
