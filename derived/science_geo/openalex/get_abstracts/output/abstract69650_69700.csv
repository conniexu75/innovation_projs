https://openalex.org/W2008999907,"Stimulation of the parafoveal retina may give rise to visual evoked responses generated in large part by stray light impinging upon the fovea. This effect appears to account for the absence of changes in the visual evoked response to parafoveal stimulation during metacontrast suppression. When the central retina is directly stimulated, the spatiotemporal interactions associated with brightness suppression during metacontrast may be readily demonstrated in a late component of the visual evoked response."

https://openalex.org/W2028368664,"A new low-temperature technique provides a practical and sensitive method of infrared quantitative analysis of all infrared-absorbing gases and volatile liquids. Because pseudo matrix isolation is suitable for qualitative identifications also, it provides a tool for analysis of complex gas mixtures."

https://openalex.org/W1967244573,"WE have recently analysed a sample of medical oxygen by mass spectrometry, and found that the level of carbon monoxide, approximately 1 per cent, far exceeded the toxic level for humans. Subsequent investigation of the literature disclosed that this phenomenon is to be expected because of the interaction of oxygen with carbon impurities in the hot tungsten filament of the mass spectrometer electron gun1–3. In a mass spectrometer, used for general analysis of organic compounds, there is the additional possibility that carbide is formed on the tungsten surface which may then react with oxygen in the system. Carbides of rhenium have the advantage of being less stable than those of tungsten and this has led to the widespread use of rhenium filaments. Even with a rhenium filament, however, significant quantities of carbon monoxide are produced in oxygen analysis."

https://openalex.org/W2030458092,"THE susceptibility of rainbow trout to ulcerative dermal necrosis1, an infectious disease of some salmonids, has become a matter of importance to fish farmers. We have shown that the aetiological agent of ulcerative dermal necrosis is filterable2 although some workers have suggested that specific bacteria3,4 or fungi5 may be the primary pathogens. Preliminary experiments indicated that rainbow trout exposed to a salmon affected by ulcerative dermal necrosis did not show symptoms of the disease whereas a healthy salmon in the same tank as the trout did. The siphoning technique successfully used to reproduce ulcerative dermal necrosis in salmon2 was adapted to the experiments described here, which were designed to ascertain the susceptibility of rainbow trout to the disease. Further experiments, also described, were carried out to show whether rainbow trout can act as symptomless carriers."

https://openalex.org/W2025197133,"A novel technique allows determination of membrane diffusivities and eliminates the complications of the fluid resistance to mass transfer on either side of the membrane. Results on the permeability of a dialysis membrane of the type used in artificial kidneys agree with previous data and are obtained in much shorter time. The measured activation energy for diffusion demonstrates that the transport of salt through the membrane occurs by the same mechanism as the diffusion of salt in water, but that only 10 percent of the membrane surface is effective."

https://openalex.org/W2029556334,"THE Australian Aborigines are an interesting population for the study of human variability due to inherited characteristics. The first study of their blood groups was published in 1922 (ref. 1) and many extensive surveys have since been undertaken. More recently discovered polymorphic characters, including the serum haptoglobins, transferrins, gamma globulins and group specific types, have also been investigated, and the results have been reviewed2–4. There is, however, no published information about the distribution of red cell acid phosphatase types among the aborigines and the study reported here was undertaken primarily to provide the information."

https://openalex.org/W2060498883,"Four laboratory populations, each consisting of flies homozygous for a wild second chromosome, were maintained in population cages. Three of them were initially characterized by low fecundity of the females; the fourth was a control. After 15 months, in all three populations with low fecundity this character was much improved; two of them, have reached the control level. The changes observed were presumably due to mutation and selection under highly competitive conditions."
