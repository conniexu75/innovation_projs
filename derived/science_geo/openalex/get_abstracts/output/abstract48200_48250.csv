https://openalex.org/W1944789189,"Aspartyl and asparaginyl deamidation, isomerization, and racemization reactions have been studied in synthetic peptides to model these spontaneous processes that alter protein structure and function. We show here that the peptide L-Val-L-Tyr-L-Pro-L-Asn-Gly-L-Ala undergoes a rapid deamidation reaction with a half-life of only 1.4 days at 37 degrees C, pH 7.4, to give an aspartyl succinimide product. Under these conditions, the succinimide product can further react by hydrolysis (half-time, 2.3h) and by racemization (half-time, 19.5 h). The net product of the deamidation reaction is a mixture of L- and D-normal aspartyl and beta-transpeptidation (isoaspartyl) hexapeptides. Replacement of the asparagine residue by an aspartic acid residue results in a 34-fold decrease in the rate of succinimide formation. Significant racemization was found to accompany the deamidation and isomerization reactions, and most of this could be accounted for by the rapid racemization of the succinimide intermediate. Replacement of the glycyl residue in the asparagine-containing peptide with a bulky leucyl or prolyl residue results in a 33-50-fold decrease in the rate of degradation. Peptide cleavage products are observed when these Asn-Leu and Asn-Pro-containing peptides are incubated. Our studies indicate that both aspartic acid and asparagine residues may be hot spots for the nonenzymatic degradation of proteins, especially in cells such as erythrocytes and eye lens, where these macromolecules must function for periods of about 120 days and 80 years, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2011104380,"Bright light can suppress nighttime melatonin production in humans, but ordinary indoor light does not have this effect. This finding suggested that bright light may have other chronobiologic effects in humans as well. Eight patients who regularly became depressed in the winter (as day length shortens) significantly improved after 1 week of exposure to bright light in the morning (but not after 1 week of bright light in the evening). The antidepressant response to morning light was accompanied by an advance (shift to an earlier time) in the onset of nighttime melatonin production. These results suggest that timing may be critical for the antidepressant effects of bright light."
https://openalex.org/W2004607866,"A molecular dynamics simulation of myoglobin provides the first direct demonstration that the potential energy surface of a protein is characterized by a large number of thermally accessible minima in the neighborhood of the native structure (for example, approximately 2000 minima were sampled in a 300-picosecond trajectory). This is expected to have important consequences for the interpretation of the activity of transport proteins and enzymes. Different minima correspond to changes in the relative orientation of the helices coupled with side-chain rearrangements that preserve the close packing of the protein interior. The conformational space sampled by the simulation is similar to that found in the evolutionary development of the globins. Glasslike behavior is expected at low temperatures. The minima obtained from the trajectory do not satisfy certain criteria for ultrametricity."
https://openalex.org/W1995445964,"The toxR gene encodes a transcriptional activator controlling cholera toxin, pilus, and outer-membrane protein expression in V. cholerae. Nucleotide sequence and mutational analysis has identified the toxR gene product as a 32,527 dalton protein. Hydropathicity analysis of the derived amino acid sequence of ToxR predicts a transmembrane structure. The properties of hybrid proteins composed of N-terminal fragments of ToxR fused to the periplasmic enzyme alkaline phosphatase provide additional evidence for the transmembrane topology of the ToxR protein. These fusion proteins also allowed the localization of the transcriptional activation and DNA binding domains of the ToxR protein to its cytoplasmically located N-terminal portion. DNA binding assays and a deletion analysis of the cholera toxin promoter support a model for transcriptional activation that involves ToxR binding to a tandemly repeated 7 bp DNA sequence 56 bp upstream of the transcriptional start point."
https://openalex.org/W2168979459,"Digital imaging of calcium indicator signals (fura-2 fluorescence) from single cardiac cells has revealed different subcellular patterns of cytoplasmic calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i) that are associated with different types of cellular appearance and behavior. In any population of enzymatically isolated rat heart cells, there are mechanically quiescent cells in which [Ca2+]i is spatially uniform, constant over time, and relatively low; spontaneously contracting cells, which have an increased [Ca2+]i, but in which the spatial uniformity of [Ca2+]i is interrupted periodically by spontaneous propagating waves of high [Ca2+]i; and cells that are hypercontracted (rounded up) and that have higher levels of [Ca2+]i than the other two types. The observed cellular and subcellular heterogeneity of [Ca2+]i in isolated cells indicates that experiments performed on suspensions of cells should be interpreted with caution. The spontaneous [Ca2+]i fluctuations previously observed without spatial resolution in multicellular preparations may actually be inhomogeneous at the subcellular level."
https://openalex.org/W2014993354,"The midblastula transition (MBT) in Xenopus can be initiated prematurely by blocking the fundamental cell-cycle oscillator with cycloheximide, in which case motility and transcription are quickly initiated. Using various inhibitors of specific events of the cell cycle that do not inhibit the autonomous oscillator, we have shown that transcription is activated when DNA synthesis is interrupted and motility is activated when cell cleavage is inhibited. Furthermore, very low levels of transcription are found to occur before the MBT. These results demonstrate that the pre-MBT egg is fully competent for transcription and motility and suggest that different features of the rapid early cell cycle normally suppress these events."
https://openalex.org/W1978555647,"In normal development both the anterior and posterior blastomeres in a 2-cell C. elegans embryo produce some descendants that become muscles. We show that cellular interactions appear to be necessary in order for the anterior blastomere to produce these muscles. The anterior blastomere does not produce any muscle descendants after either the posterior blastomere or one of the daughters of the posterior blastomere is removed from the egg. Moreover, we demonstrate that a daughter of the anterior blastomere that normally does not produce muscles appears capable of generating muscles when interchanged with its sister, a cell that normally does produce muscles. Embryos develop normally after these blastomeres are interchanged, suggesting that cellular interactions play a major role in determining the fates of some cells in early embryogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1585735064,"Catalase (H2O2:H2O2 oxidoreductase, EC 1.11.1.6) is of historical interest for having been the subject of some of the earliest investigations of enzymes. A feature of catalase that has been poorly understood for several decades, however, is the mechanism by which catalase remains active in the presence of its own substrate, hydrogen peroxide. We reported recently that catalase contains tightly bound NADPH. The present study with bovine and human catalase revealed that NADPH both prevents and reverses the accumulation of compound II, an inactive form of catalase that is generated slowly when catalase is exposed to hydrogen peroxide. Since the effect of NADPH occurs even at NADPH concentrations below 0.1 microM, the protective mechanism is likely to operate in vivo. This discovery of the role of catalase-bound NADPH brings a unity to the concept of two different mechanisms for disposing of hydrogen peroxide (catalase and the glutathione reductase/peroxidase pathway) by revealing that both mechanisms are dependent on NADPH."
https://openalex.org/W1505283703,"Synthetic peptides corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of the fibrinogen gamma chain inhibit the binding of fibrinogen, fibronectin, and von Willebrand factor to platelets, yet the active decapeptide sequence has only been found in fibrinogen to date. In contrast, all three proteins contain Arg-Gly-Asp sequences, and peptides containing Arg-Gly-Asp are potent inhibitors of their binding to activated platelets. We have analyzed the relationship between these peptide sets by direct binding assays. H12 (gamma 400-411) inhibited the binding of an Arg-Gly-Asp-containing peptide to platelets with similar dose response to inhibition of fibronectin binding. We have previously reported that GPIIb-IIIa binds to immobilized Arg-Gly-Asp peptides and can be eluted by Arg-Gly-Asp-containing peptides in solution. Both H12 and L10 (gamma 402-411) completely eluted GPIIb-IIIa bound to immobilized Arg-Gly-Asp peptides. Conversely, when GPIIb-IIIa was bound to immobilized L10, either L10 or an Arg-Gly-Asp peptide could elute it. Peptide specificity was established by the failure of Gly-Arg-Gly-Glu-Ser-Pro or acetylated L10 to elute GPIIb-IIIa from the immobilized peptides. These results indicate that the two peptide sets interact with the same receptor which contains GPIIb-IIIa."
https://openalex.org/W2069958139,"Posttranslational processing of vitamin K-dependent proteins includes gamma-carboxylation of specific glutamic acid residues to form gamma-carboxyglutamic acids. To determine whether carboxylation is directed by the propeptide sequence, homologous among the precursors of these proteins, alterations were made in the Factor IX propeptide cDNA. The extent of gamma-carboxylation of recombinant Factor IX was assessed using conformation-specific antibodies directed against the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-dependent, metal-stabilized structure. Deletion of the propeptide (residues -18 to -1) abolished carboxylation, but not secretion, of Factor IX. Substitution of alanine for phenylalanine -16 or glutamic acid for alanine -10 also impaired carboxylation. These results indicate that the Factor IX propeptide participates in defining a recognition site that designates an adjacent glutamic acid-rich domain for gamma-carboxylation. The association of the propeptide with the gamma-carboxylation recognition site provides the first demonstration of a specific function served by a propeptide in posttranslational protein processing."
https://openalex.org/W1586750917,"We have examined the effects of the differentiating agent, sodium butyrate, on the induction of alkaline phosphatase in human colonic tumor cell line LS174T. Culture of these cells in the presence of 2 mM butyrate caused this activity to increase from less than 0.0001 unit/mg of protein to greater than 0.7 unit/mg of protein over an 8-day period. This induction proceeded in a nonlinear fashion with a lag time of 2-3 days occurring before enzymatic activity began to rise. These increases in activity were accompanied by elevations in the content of a placental-like isozyme of alkaline phosphatase as demonstrated by Western immunoblots. Dome formation, indicative of differentiation in cultured cells, also required 3 days treatment with butyrate before becoming evident. The rate of biosynthesis of the enzyme, examined using metabolic labeling with L-[35S]methionine and immunoprecipitation, was found to increase continuously between days 2 and 6 of butyrate treatment. Northern blot analysis indicated that treatment of these cells with butyrate caused greater than 20-fold induction of a 2700-base mRNA that hybridized to a cDNA probe for placental alkaline phosphatase. The mRNA for alkaline phosphatase produced by these cells upon butyrate treatment was approximately 300-400 bases smaller than the mRNA for alkaline phosphatase found in placenta. Human small intestine also contained two mRNAs that hybridized relatively weakly with the placental alkaline phosphatase probe. These results indicate that a placental alkaline phosphatase-like protein and mRNA are induced by butyrate in LS174T cells with a time course consistent with cellular differentiation preceding induction."
https://openalex.org/W1584939531,"Adenosine, acting via A1 adenosine receptors, can inhibit adenylate cyclase activity in adipocytes. To assess the effects of chronic adenosine agonist exposure on the A1 adenosine receptor system of adipocytes, rats were infused with (-)-phenylisopropyladenosine or vehicle for 6 days and membranes were prepared. Basal as well as isoproterenol-, sodium fluoride-, and forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities were significantly increased (approximately 2-fold) in membranes from treated animals. (-)-Phenylisopropyladenosine-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was significantly (p = 0.0001) attenuated in membranes from treated rats (20.1 +/- 2.1% inhibition) versus controls (31.6 +/- 2.3% inhibition). Prostaglandin E1-induced inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was also attenuated: 11.7 +/- 3.6 versus 23.2 +/- 4.6% (p = 0.001). Using the A1 adenosine receptor agonist radioligand (-)-N6-(3-[125I]iodo-4-hydroxyphenylisopropyl)adenosine, 32% fewer high affinity binding sites were detected in membranes from treated animals (p less than 0.04). Photoaffinity labeling with N6-2-(3-[125I]iodo-4-azidophenyl)ethyladenosine revealed no gross difference in receptor structure. The number of beta-adrenergic receptors as well as the percentage of receptors in the high affinity state as assessed by (-)-3-[125I]iodocyanopindolol binding were the same in both groups. In membranes from treated rats, the amount of [alpha-32P]NAD incorporated by pertussis toxin into the alpha subunit of the inhibitory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (Ni) was decreased by 37 +/- 11%. Concurrently, the quantity of label incorporated by cholera toxin into the alpha subunit of the stimulatory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (Ns) was increased by 44 +/- 14% in treated membranes. Finally, the capacity of Ns solubilized from treated membranes to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity when reconstituted into cyc- S49 lymphoma cell membranes was enhanced by approximately 50% compared to control. Thus, heterologous desensitization, manifested by a diminished capacity to inhibit adenylate cyclase and an enhanced responsiveness to stimulatory effectors, can be induced in the A1 adenosine receptor-adenylate cyclase system of adipocytes. A decrease in Ni alpha subunit concomitant with an increase in Ns alpha subunit quantity and activity may represent the biochemical mechanism of desensitization in this system."
https://openalex.org/W1567065116,"Dipolyunsaturated phosphatidylcholines from bovine retina contain a whole series of unusual fatty acids. Methyl esters from these acids are very strongly retained on polar and nonpolar gas-liquid chromatography stationary phases. On thin layers of silica-AgNO3, they separate as tetra-, penta-, and hexaenoic fatty acid methyl esters. After hydrogenation, the three polyunsaturated fractions give the same series of saturated methyl esters, having 20 (or 22)-36 carbon atoms. High pressure liquid chromatography, as well as gas-liquid chromatography, indicates that the new components of the three fractions are even-carbon homologs of well known polyenoic fatty acids of the n-6 and n-3 families, since they behave as series of 20-36-carbon tetraenoic (n-6), pentaenoic (n-3 and n-6), and hexaenoic (n-3) fatty acids. Their occurrence in phospholipid molecules also having docosahexaenoate (22:6) explains the separation of major dipolyunsaturated phosphatidylcholines from retina into dodecaenoic, undecaenoic, and decaenoic fractions after argentation thin layer chromatography. Using high pressure liquid chromatography, the latter are resolved into individual species having 10-12 double bonds and 42-58 carbon atoms. The unusual PCs are thus endowed not only with the highest degree of unsaturation, but with the longest hydrocarbon chains yet reported for vertebrate glycerophospholipids. It is shown that phosphatidylcholines containing the novel fatty acids are highly concentrated in photoreceptor membranes and that they occur in the retina of vertebrates so distant in evolution as fish, birds, and various mammals."
https://openalex.org/W1539365968,"A complete series of even-carbon chain polyenoic fatty acids having 20-36 carbons occur in dipolyunsaturated molecular species of phosphatidylcholine from bovine retina. Using oxidative ozonolysis, it is shown that very long chain tetraenes belong to the n-6 series, hexaenes to the n-3 series, and major pentaenes to the n-3 series of fatty acids (very long chain n-6 pentaenes also occur). Molecular ions are obtained by electron impact mass spectrometry of methyl ester derivatives which conclusively identify the major components of this novel group of fatty acids. Mass spectral patterns are similar for the major very long chain tetraenes, for the pentaenes, and for the hexaenes, but different for each group of unsaturation. Very long chain (C24 to C36) polyenes account for about half the weight (40 mol %) of the acyl chains of major dodecaenoic, undecaenoic, and decaenoic molecular species of bovine retina phosphatidylcholine, the other half being made up by docosahexaenoate (22:6 n-3)."
https://openalex.org/W1590482447,"Rabbit alveolar macrophage microsomes were found to acylate 1-[3H]alkyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine (GPC) (lyso platelet-activating factor) in the absence of any cofactors, indicating the presence of transacylation activity. The transacylation activity was comparable to the activity of acyl-CoA:1-alkyl-GPC acyltransferase. The fatty acyl moieties introduced into 1-[3H]alkyl-GPC from membrane lipids by microsomes were mainly 20:4 (n-6). A very similar acylation profile was observed for the acylation of 1-[3H]alkyl-GPC in intact macrophages, suggesting that the CoA-independent transacylation system plays a very important part in the acylation of 1-[3H]alkyl-GPC in cells. We also confirmed that 14C-labeled 20:4(n-6), 20:5(n-3), 22:4(n-6), and 22:6(n-3) were transferred well from diacyl-GPC to 1-alkyl-GPC in a CoA-independent manner. The transfer rates for 16:0, 18:0, and 18:1 from diacyl-GPC to 1-alkyl-GPC were very low in the presence and absence of CoA. On the other hand, the transfer of 20:4 from diacyl-GPE or diacyl-GPI to 1-alkyl-GPC or 1-acyl-GPC was markedly increased by the addition of CoA. The above results indicate that the transacylation system exhibits distinct donor and acceptor selectivities and CoA dependency. These transacylation reactions could be very important in the regulation of the levels and the availability of lysophospholipids, including lyso platelet-activating factor, and C20 and C22 polyunsaturated fatty acids in living cells."
https://openalex.org/W2137744893,"An analysis of the circumsporozoite (CS) genes of six closely related plasmodia is presented. Like other plasmodial antigens, the CS protein contains tandem repeats flanked by conventional nonrepeated sequences. Our analysis shows that the repeats, which encode the immunodominant epitope of the CS protein, diverge more rapidly than the remainder of the gene, and that the maintenance and evolution of the repeats cannot be explained as the result of selection at the protein level. We argue that a mechanism acts directly on the DNA sequence to constrain the internal divergence of the repeats, and as a result promotes their rapid divergence between taxa."
https://openalex.org/W1596882142,"Horseradish peroxidase rapidly catalyzed the H2O2-dependent polymerization of acetaminophen. Acetaminophen polymerization was decreased and formation of GSSG and minor amounts of GSH-acetaminophen conjugates were detected in reaction mixtures containing GSH. These data suggest that horseradish peroxidase catalyzed the 1-electron oxidation of acetaminophen and that GSH decreased polymerization by reducing the product, N-acetyl-p-benzosemiquinone imine, back to acetaminophen. Analyses of reaction mixtures that did not contain GSH showed N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine formation shortly after initiation of reactions. When GSH was added to similar reaction mixtures at various times, 3-(glutathion-S-yl)-acetaminophen was formed. The formation and disappearance of this product were very similar to N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine formation and were consistent with the disproportionation of 2 mol of N-acetyl-p-benzosemiquinone imine to 1 mol of N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine and 1 mol of acetaminophen followed by the rapid reaction of N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine with GSH to form 3-(glutathion-S-yl)acetaminophen. When acetaminophen was incubated with NADPH, oxygen and hepatic microsomes from phenobarbital-pretreated rats, 1.2 nmol 3-(glutathion-S-yl)acetaminophen/nmol cytochrome P-450/10 min was formed. Formation of polymers was not observed indicating that N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine was formed via an overall 2-electron oxidation rather than a disproportionation reaction. However, when cumene hydroperoxide was replaced by NADPH in microsomal incubations, polymerization was observed suggesting that cytochrome P-450 might also catalyze the 1-electron oxidation of acetaminophen."
https://openalex.org/W1518915071,"SMP-2 is a rat liver protein whose synthesis is influenced by both androgens and aging. The steady-state level of its mRNA is repressed by the androgen. Compared to the adult male, SMP-2 mRNA is found in higher amounts in the prepubertal and senescent male rat livers which show relative androgen insensitivity. A cDNA library in the plasmid pBR322 was constructed from the female rat liver which contains a high level of SMP-2 mRNAs. Recombinant plasmids were screened by differential colony hybridization to 32P-labeled single-stranded cDNAs from adult female and adult male hepatic poly(A)+ RNAs. From a total of 3500 recombinant clones, 11 highly female specific clones were identified. From these female specific colonies the SMP-2 cDNA-containing plasmid (pSP11) was identified by its ability to select an mRNA species whose translation product is immunochemically and electrophoretically indistinguishable from SMP-2. This insert represents a 571-base pair portion of the SMP-2 cDNA. Rescreening of the library at a high colony density using the 32P-labeled cDNA insert of pSP11 identified several positive clones with larger inserts. Hybrid-selected mRNA translation again confirmed these clones to carry SMP-2 cDNA sequences. The plasmid pSP4a containing a 1040-base pair cDNA insert of SMP-2 was characterized by DNA sequence analysis. The size of the cDNA insert of pSP4a is close to the estimated size of the SMP-2 mRNA. The cDNA sequence provides an open reading frame of 282 amino acid residues. A comparison of the translated amino acid sequence with the protein sequences of NBRF-PIR, PSQNEW, and LOSALA data bases did not establish any sequence homology with known proteins. Northern blot analysis using the 32P-labeled cDNA insert of pSP4a confirms the androgenic repression of the SMP-2 mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1574001549,"When crude membrane fraction from bovine adrenal gland was incubated with type D botulinum toxin in the presence of NAD, a membrane protein with a molecular weight of 21,000 was specifically ADP-ribosylated. This ADP-ribosylation occurred dependent on the dose of the toxin and was abolished by prior boiling ADP-ribose transfer to the membrane protein was significantly suppressed when agmatine and L-arginine methyl ester were included in the reaction mixture. Dithiothreitol stimulated this ADP-ribosylation about 3-fold. Incubation of membrane fractions from mouse brain and pancreas with this toxin also resulted in ADP-ribosylation of a protein of the same molecular weight. These results suggested that type D botulinum toxin catalyzed transfer of an ADP-ribose moiety of NAD to the specific membrane protein common to secretory cells."
https://openalex.org/W2053529409,"As a regulator of the female-specific gene Sxl, da+ provides an essential maternal component in the control of sex determination and dosage compensation; nevertheless, neither the maternal nor zygotic phenotypes of the original mutant da allele is sex-specific. Here we clarify the role of da+ in Drosophila development, finding: this sex determination gene is indeed pleiotropic; zygotic functioning of da+ is essential in both sexes for somatic cell development, but not for germ cell development; da female sterility results from a somatic, rather than germ-line, defect; and expression of da+ in the maternal germ line is required only for daughters in the subsequent generation, as expected for a specific regulator of Sxl+. These conclusions follow from the characterization of new da null alleles isolated by a selection for defects in maternally acting positive regulators of Sxl."
https://openalex.org/W2081163778,"Behavioral experiments indicated that the marine opisthobranch mollusk Tritonia diomedea can derive directional cues from the magnetic field of the earth. The magnetic direction toward which nudibranchs spontaneously oriented in the geomagnetic field showed recurring patterns of variation correlated with lunar phase, suggesting that the behavioral response to magnetism is modulated by a circa-lunar rhythm. The discovery of a magnetic sense in a mollusk with giant, reidentifiable neurons provides a unique opportunity to study the cellular mechanisms underlying magnetic field detection."
https://openalex.org/W1515035492,"HED10 is an autoimmune antibody (IgG) which shows considerable specificity for the single-stranded DNA poly(dT). Production of Fab fragments by papain digestion resulted in heterogeneity as judged by isoelectric focusing gels, which had a marked negative effect on crystallization. However, a single species of Fab with a pI of 7.6 could be isolated in good yield by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, and good crystals were produced by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The space group was P21 with cell dimensions, a = 64.2, b = 90.0, c = 42.3 A, and beta = 96.7 degrees. These crystals diffract to about 2.2 A resolution. The structure of Fab HED10 was solved by the molecular replacement method using the known structure of McPC603 and is refined to R = 27.2% at 3.0 A resolution. Fab HED10 is more extended than McPC603 and has an elbow angle (between the variable and constant domains) of 162 degrees, very similar to that observed in Fab KOL. The majority of the hypervariable regions are visible in the model."
https://openalex.org/W2027793574,"The inflammatory reaction of human neutrophils consists of two successive phases. In the first, designated chemotaxis, the cells home in on a foreign intruder. In the second, the cells attempt to eliminate the intruder by secreting lysosomal enzymes and superoxide anions. The initiation of chemotaxis involves prompt morphological changes that are manifested by a sharp biphasic drop in light scattering, accompanied by a transient cytosolic acidification. In a search for a causal relation between these two events, the neutrophil cytoplasm was abruptly acidified by the application of sodium propionate. This evoked a pulse of decreasing light-scattering, the time course and amplitude of which were practically identical to the rapid response induced by chemoattractants such as N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (fMLP). Both fMLP- and sodium propionate-induced responses were unaffected by amiloride, but were inhibited with a similar dose-dependence by a series of proton uncouplers. The initial phase of the cytosolic acidification seems, therefore, to fulfill the criteria for a second messenger for the initiation of chemotaxis."
https://openalex.org/W1605953390,"Rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells grown in the presence or absence of nerve growth factor (NGF) were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine or 32Pi, and neurofilament subunits were recovered by immunoprecipitation from cellular extracts. The neurofilament subunits, with apparent molecular masses on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels of 68 kDa (light, L), 145 kDa (medium, M), and 200 kDa (heavy, H), were all found to be expressed in PC12 cells grown in the absence and presence of NGF. H was expressed at very low levels and in a form that migrated more rapidly on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels than H from rat brain. M was synthesized as a more rapidly migrating precursor that underwent modification within 3 h after labeling to a slower migrating form that co-migrated with M from rat brain. Analysis of the different M species by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis indicated that they also had different isoelectric points consistent with differences in phosphate content. NGF treatment resulted in increased L synthesis and, to a lesser degree, M synthesis, but had no effect on H synthesis. NGF also increased the stability of the modified form of M. All three subunits were 32P-labeled, and NGF increased the incorporation of 32P into M and H. Neurofilament subunits were also immunoprecipitated from a soluble fraction of [35S]methionine-labeled PC12 cells. This soluble pool of subunits differed from the cytoskeleton-associated pool in the relative proportions of individual subunits, M being the predominant form in the former and L in the latter."
https://openalex.org/W1537040327,"The alpha-crystallin primary gene product A2 and its post-translational modified counterpart A1 were isolated from calf lens cortex. The amino acid compositions determined from both chains were almost identical and in excellent agreement with that calculated from the reported sequence of A2. Chemical analysis of phosphate revealed 1 mol/mol of A1 and was negative in A2. Phosphoamino acid analysis demonstrated the presence of phosphoserine only in A1. Chymotryptic peptide maps of A2 and A1 resolved approximately 50 peptides and were strikingly similar. An apparent change in the relative mobility of one peptide was the only difference observed between A1 and A2. Phosphate analysis of this peptide obtained from A1 and A2 was positive only in the peptide from A1. Identical amino acid composition and the sequence Arg-Leu-Pro-Ser-Asn-Val-Asp-Gln-Ser-Ala-Leu was found for the peptide isolated from both chains, corresponding to residues 119 to 129 in the reported sequence of A2. These results indicate that the post-translational modification of A2 to A1 is the result of a phosphorylation reaction rather than a spontaneous nonenzymatic deamidation as previously suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1604170139,"The induction of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) mRNA by glucocorticoids in rat hepatoma cells requires ongoing protein synthesis. Here we show that the 5'-flanking region of the AGP gene confers glucocorticoid responsiveness on the expression of heterologous coding sequences. Moreover, the induction of beta-globin mRNA directed by the AGP promoter is inhibited by concurrent treatment with cycloheximide, thereby suggesting that the requirement for protein synthesis is mediated through 5'-flanking sequences. Analysis of the effects of varying durations of cycloheximide treatment indicates that both the endogenous AGP gene and the transfected AGP-beta-globin chimeric gene are induced normally by dexamethasone during the first 1-2h of concurrent treatment. In addition, pretreatment with cycloheximide yields a decrease in the subsequent induction of both beta-globin and AGP RNAs. These data support the notion that a pre-existing and labile protein, perhaps in concert with the glucocorticoid receptor, acts through the 5'-flanking region of the AGP gene to stimulate transcription from the AGP promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1877311823,"When cultures of the temperature-sensitive Chinese hamster ovary cell mutant tsH1 are shifted from 34 degrees C (permissive temperature) to 39.5 degrees C (nonpermissive temperature), protein synthesis is inhibited by more than 80%. This is due principally to a block in activity of polypeptide chain initiation factor eIF-2. In this paper we show that there is impairment of the ability of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) to displace GDP from eIF-2 X GDP complexes in extracts from cells incubated at the nonpermissive temperature. Addition of GEF or of high concentrations of eIF-2 stimulates protein synthesis to the level observed in control cell extracts, suggesting that GEF is rate-limiting for eIF-2 activity and overall protein synthesis at the nonpermissive temperature. Analysis of eIF-2 by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting reveals an increase in the proportion of the alpha subunit in the phosphorylated form from 5.5 +/- 2.4% to 17.2 +/- 3.9% on shifting tsH1 cells from 34 to 39.5 degrees C. No such effect is seen in wild-type cells, which do not exhibit temperature-sensitive protein synthetic activity. Since the primary lesion in tsH1 cells is in their leucyl-tRNA synthetase, these results suggest a role for eIF-2 phosphorylation and GEF activity in coupling the rate of polypeptide chain initiation to the activity of the chain elongation machinery."
https://openalex.org/W1479674172,"Antithrombin-III Denver is a mutant protein which differs from the normal in being defective in serine protease binding (Sambrano, J. E., Jacobson, L. J., Reeve, E. B., Manco-Johnson, M. J., and Hathaway, W. E. (1986) J. Clin. Invest. 77, 887-893). It was isolated from the blood of an individual heterozygous for the abnormal gene by: affinity separation on heparin-Sepharose to obtain an antithrombin fraction, and gel filtration of the species present following complexing of the antithrombin fraction with a small excess of thrombin. The reduced, S-carboxymethylated protein formed a mixture of soluble tryptic peptides which was fractionated on Vydac C18. A single, unique peptide not present in a parallel experiment with normal antithrombin-III was isolated. This peptide was identified by sequence analysis and synthesis to correspond to residues 394-399 in the known sequence of the inhibitor, with leucine replacing reactive site P'1 residue Ser394. Although chromatograms of the tryptic peptides from the normal and mutant proteins were otherwise indistinguishable, the existence of additional residue replacements is not excluded. Measurements of the rate of thrombin binding by the mutant protein with p-aminobenzamidine as a fluorescent indicator showed that the second-order rate constant is reduced drastically. Meaningful measurements with the mutant protein could only be made in the presence of heparin and revealed a reduction of about 4000-fold in the rate constant."
https://openalex.org/W1503716060,"The nucleic acid binding properties of the testis protein, TP, were studied with the help of physical techniques, namely, fluorescence quenching, UV difference absorption spectroscopy, and thermal melting. Results of quenching of tyrosine fluorescence of TP upon its binding to double-stranded and denatured rat liver nucleosome core DNA and poly(rA) suggest that the tyrosine residues of TP interact/intercalate with the bases of these nucleic acids. From the fluorescence quenching data, obtained at 50 mM NaCl concentration, the apparent association constants for binding of TP to native and denatured DNA and poly(rA) were calculated to be 4.4 X 10(3) M-1, 2.86 X 10(4) M-1, and 8.5 X 10(4) M-1, respectively. UV difference absorption spectra upon TP binding to poly(rA) and rat liver core DNA showed a TP-induced hyperchromicity at 260 nm which is suggestive of local melting of poly(rA) and DNA. The results from thermal melting studies of binding of TP to calf thymus DNA at 1 mM NaCl as well as 50 mM NaCl showed that although at 1 mM NaCl TP brings about a slight stabilization of the DNA against thermal melting, a destabilization of the DNA was observed at 50 mM NaCl. From these results it is concluded that TP, having a higher affinity for single-stranded nucleic acids, destabilizes double- stranded DNA, thus behaving like a DNA-melting protein."
https://openalex.org/W1544564945,"Plasma amine oxidases catalyze the oxidative deamination of amines to aldehydes, followed by a 2e- reduction of O2 to H2O2. Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), previously believed to be restricted to prokaryotes, has recently been proposed to be the cofactor undergoing reduction in the first half-reaction of bovine plasma amine oxidase (Ameyama, M., Hayashi, U., Matsushita, K., Shinagawa, E., and Adachi, O. (1984) Agric. Biol. Chem. 48, 561-565; Lobenstein-Verbeek, C. L., Jongejan, J. A., Frank, J., and Duine, J. A. (1984) FEBS Lett. 170, 305-309). This result is unexpected, since model studies with PQQ implicate Schiff's base formation between a reactive carbonyl and substrates, whereas experiments with bovine plasma amine oxidase have failed to provide evidence for a carbonyl cofactor. We have, therefore, re-examined putative adducts between substrate and enzyme-bound cofactor, employing a combination of [14C]benzylamine and [3H]NaCNBH3. The use of the relatively weak reductant, NaCNBH3, affords Schiff's base specificity and permits the study of enzyme below pH 7.0. As we show, enzyme can only be inactivated by NaCNBH3 in the presence of substrate, leading to the incorporation of 1 mol of [14C]benzylamine/mol of enzyme subunit at complete inactivation. By contrast, we are unable to detect any labeling with [3H]NaCNBH3, analogous to an earlier study with [3H]NaCNBH4 (Suva, R. H., and Abeles, R. H. (1978) Biochemistry 17, 3538-3545). We conclude, first, that our inability to obtain adducts containing both carbon 14 and tritium rules out the reductive trapping either of amine substrate with pyridoxal phosphate or of aldehyde product with a lysyl side chain and, second, that the observed pattern of labeling is fully consistent with the presence of PQQ at the active site of bovine plasma amine oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1506346853,"In the preceding paper (Bhattacharyya, L., Ceccarini, C., Lorenzoni, P., and Brewer, C.F. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 1288-1293), we have demonstrated that certain high mannose and bisected hybrid type glycopeptides are bivalent for concanavalin A (ConA) binding. In the present study, we have investigated the interactions of ConA with a series of synthetic nonbisected and bisected complex type oligosaccharides and related glycopeptides. The modes of binding of the carbohydrates were studied by nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion techniques, and their affinities were determined by hemagglutination inhibition measurements. We find that certain bisected complex type oligosaccharides are capable of binding and precipitating the lectin. The corresponding nonbisected analogs, however, bind but do not precipitate the protein. The stoichiometries of the precipitin reactions were investigated by quantitative precipitation analyses. The equivalence zones (regions of maximum precipitation) of the precipitin curves indicate that the bisected complex type oligosaccharides are bivalent for lectin binding. Data for the nonbisected analogs are consistent with their being univalent. The nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion and precipitation data indicate that nonbisected and bisected complex type carbohydrates bind with different mechanisms and conformations. The former class binds by extended site interactions with the protein involving the 2 alpha-mannose residues on the alpha(1-6) and alpha(1-3) arms of the core beta-mannose residue. The latter class binds by only 1 of these 2 mannose residues, which leaves the other mannose residue free to bind to a second ConA molecule. The role of the bisecting GlcNAc residue in affecting the binding properties of complex type carbohydrates to ConA is discussed, and the results are related to the possible structure-function properties of complex type glycopeptides on the surface of cells."
https://openalex.org/W1522523082,"The involvement of phospholipase(s) A in lipid peroxidation of rat liver microsomes was investigated by: (a) determining the effects of phospholipase A inhibitors (p-bromophenylacyl bromide, chlorpromazine, mepacrine) on the accumulation of thiobarbituric acid reactivity or on levels of oxidized phospholipids in response to selected oxidative stimuli and (b) measurement of phospholipase A activities in response to these agents. Lipid peroxidation in response to various peroxidation systems was inhibited completely by exposure of microsomes to p-bromophenylacyl bromide (250 microM). The effectiveness of p-bromophenylacyl bromide was dependent on the presence of glutathione (200 microM) in preincubation mixtures. Chlorpromazine (100 microM) and mepacrine (100 microM) also effectively inhibited peroxidation, and their potency was independent of glutathione. The accumulation of oxidized phospholipids in response to the potent peroxidation stimulus alloxan/ferrous ion was similarly inhibited by p-bromophenylacyl bromide, although the level of oxidized phospholipid in response to the initiator ADP/ferrous ion was not affected. Microsomal phospholipase A1 activity, assessed using a liposomal substrate, was substantially enhanced by promoters of lipid peroxidation. Phospholipase A2 activity was not detected using a liposomal substrate but was evident using radiolabeled microsomes as endogenous substrate and was enhanced by oxidative stimuli. We conclude that phospholipase A activity may play an integral role in the microsomal lipid peroxidation mechanism. Based on this study, we hypothesize a role for phospholipases in facilitating propagation reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1616798573,"Previous biochemical characterizations of the cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor have used the long probe 125I-Bolton-Hunter-CCK-33 since it was the only CCK analogue with high affinity and high specific radioactivity which possessed an amino group available for chemical cross-linking. These studies have consistently identified a major binding protein of approximately 81 kilodaltons and have identified several minor proteins which were obtained under different cross-linking conditions and in different laboratories. Because the receptor-binding region of CCK-33 (carboxyl-terminal heptapeptide) is so far removed from the radiolabel and from available amino groups (positions 1 and 11), this probe carries potential for proteolytic cleavage of label from receptor and for labeling near neighbors instead of the binding site. We therefore designed two probes for the CCK receptor. 125I-Bolton-Hunter-Lys-Gly-CCK-8 has an epsilon-amino group available for cross-linking. 125I-Tyr-[Thr28,Nle31]CCK-25-33 has an alpha-amino group for cross-linking and has the major advantage of being labeled by oxidative means, unique for CCK derivatives. Both radioiodinated decapeptides were purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography to yield specific radioactivity of 2,000 Ci/mmol; demonstrated saturable, specific, and high affinity binding to rat pancreatic plasma membranes; and retained full biological activity to stimulate amylase secretion. Using a variety of cross-linking methods, these probes each identified the same Mr = 85,000-95,000 protein in rat pancreatic plasmalemma, and CCK-8 competed for this labeling in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50 = 1 nM). No change in apparent mobility of this band was observed under reducing or nonreducing conditions, suggesting lack of covalent attachment to other subunits. The Mr = 85,000-95,000 species migrated differently on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels than any of the components previously identified using 125I-Bolton-Hunter-CCK-33, confirming the novel nature of this binding protein. These short probes should be very useful for further characterization of CCK receptors on this and other tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2124912230,"Uroporphyrinogen III synthase (hydroxymethylbilane hydro-lyase (cyclizing); EC 4.2.1.75), the fourth enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway, was purified to homogeneity from human erythrocytes. For enzyme purification and characterization, a sensitive coupled enzyme assay was used which generated the substrate, hydroxymethylbilane; the oxidized product, uroporphyrin III, was quantitated by high pressure liquid chromatography. Uroporphyrinogen III synthase was initially separated from delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase and hydroxymethylbilane synthase by a preparative anion exchange chromatographic step. Subsequent chromatography on hydroxyapatite, phenyl-Sepharose, and Sephadex G-100 purified the enzyme about 70,000-fold with an 8% yield. Homogeneous enzyme was obtained following a final C4-reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatographic step which removed a single major and several minor protein contaminants from the enzyme. The purified enzyme had a specific activity of over 300,000 units/mg, an isoelectric point of 5.5, and was thermolabile (t1/2 at 60 degrees C approximately 1 min). Molecular weight studies by gel filtration (Mr approximately equal to 30,000) and analytical sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Mr approximately equal to 29,500) were consistent with the enzyme being a monomer. Using hydroxymethylbilane as substrate, the purified enzyme formed uroporphyrinogen III in the absence of hydroxymethylbilane synthase or other cofactors. The pH optimum was 7.4 and the Km for hydroxymethylbilane was 5-20 microM. The enzyme was activated by Na+, K+, Mg+, and Ca2+ and was inhibited by Cd2+, Cu2+, Hg2+, and Zn2+. Amino acid composition analysis was performed, and the N-terminal sequence, Met-Lys-Val-Leu-Leu-Leu, was determined by microsequencing. The availability of the purified enzyme should permit investigation of its reaction mechanism as well as facilitate biochemical and molecular studies of the genetic defect in congenital erythropoietic porphyria."
https://openalex.org/W2005806889,"The glucocorticoid receptor from mouse AtT-20 cells exists in three forms: the untransformed receptor (9.1S; Mr of 319,000), a large oligomeric molecule that does not bind to DNA; the transformed receptor (4S; Mr of 96,000), which is formed by dissociation of untransformed receptor after steroid binding and which binds to DNA to modulate gene expression; and an intermediate size receptor (6S; Mr of 132,000), which also binds to DNA and contains a bound small RNA molecule. This RNA species has now been purified and identified as transfer RNA (tRNA). The three tRNA's for the basic amino acids accounted for about 78% of the total amino acid-accepting activity [arginine (52%), lysine (17%), and histidine (9%)], while the remaining 22% was represented by six other tRNA species. This tRNA-binding activity of the glucocorticoid receptor may reflect post-transcriptional mechanisms of regulating gene expression, such as alterations in the translational efficiency of or the modulation of the stability of hormone-induced proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1488768117,"Hepatocytes obtained from livers derived from fed rats perfused with a collagenase-containing mixture were found to contain significant levels of platelet-activating factor activity as isolated by Silica Gel G thin layer chromatography. However, when soybean trypsin inhibitor was included in the collagenase-containing perfusion medium for hepatocyte preparation, platelet-activating factor activity could not be detected on Silica Gel G chromatograms. Examination of the lipids extracted from freeze clamped perfused rat livers revealed low, but detectable, levels of platelet-activating factor. Further investigation of these observations indicated that a lipid-like inhibitor was present in freeze-clamped perfused livers as well as in hepatocytes isolated in the presence of soybean trypsin inhibitor. In each instance platelet-activating factor and this newly discovered inhibitor, which comigrated at the same RF value on Silica Gel G thin layer chromatography plates, could be separated by further chromatography on high performance thin layer plates. The present study shows that platelet-activating factor is present in unstimulated liver and that its detection is masked by an endogenous lipid-like inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W1568067295,"Circular dichroic spectra revealed that the previously known regular, asymmetric condensation of DNA by H1 histone was modulated by HMG1, a nonhistone chromosomal protein. Under approximately physiological salt and pH conditions (150 mM NaCl, pH 7), ellipticities at 270 nm were observed as follows: DNA, 9 X 10(3) degree, cm2/dmol nucleotide; DNA X H1 histone complex (1:0.4, w/w), -37 X 10(3) degree, cm2/dmol nucleotide, and DNA X H1 X HMG1 complex (1:0.4:0.4 w/w/w), -52 X 10(3) degree, cm2/dmol. HMG1 by itself did not distort the spectrum of DNA, showing that the effect of HMG1 on the DNA X H1 complex was not simply the summation of individual effects of HMG1 and H1 on the DNA spectrum. The effect of added HMG1 on the spectrum of the preformed DNA X H1 complex depended on the amount of HMG1 added and developed slowly (a day) as if a structure required annealing. The ternary complex, DNA X HMG1 X 1, seemed to represent a specific structure, since its formation depeNded on the reduced sulfhydryl state of HMG1; the disulfide form of HMG1, which was shown by circular dichroism to contain more random coil than did the reduced form, had no effect on the circular dichroic spectrum of the DNA X H1 complex."
https://openalex.org/W1577128492,"The structure of skeletal troponin C (sTnC) comprises two independently folded domains connected by an alpha-helical loop (Herzberg, O., and James, M.N.G. (1985) Nature 313, 653-659). Both the NH2-terminal domain TR1C (9-84) and the COOH-terminal domain TR2C (89-159) can be obtained by limited tryptic cleavage. Here we report on proton and cadmium-113 NMR studies of Ca2+, Mg2+, and Cd2+ binding to these two separated domains. Our studies indicate that both halves retain a structure in the apo- and Ca2+-forms which resembles that of the intact protein. The events accompanying Ca2+ binding to these fragments are consistent with a biphasic binding pattern for sTnC, where the two sites in the COOH-terminal half are filled before those in the NH2-terminal half. Mg2+ only binds strongly to the two calcium-binding sites in the COOH-terminal half. The binding of this metal ion gives rise to a similar conformation for TR2C as that obtained with Ca2+. Whereas the binding of Ca2+ to the COOH-terminal part of sTnC takes place in a positive cooperative manner, the binding of this metal ion to TR2C occurs sequentially. Nevertheless, both Ca2+ ions bound to TR2C are in slow exchange (koff less than 10s-1). The binding of Mg24 both to sTnC and TR2C follows a sequential pattern with one site in slow exchange (koff less than 20 s-1) and one site in fast exchange (koff greater than 800 s-1). Binding of Cd2+ to TR2C occurs in a positive cooperative manner and results in the same conformation as observed with Ca2+. Cadmium-113 NMR spectra obtained at 5 degrees C confirm that two strong Cd2+-binding sites are localized in the COOH-terminal half and two weaker ones in the NH2-terminal half. It is concluded that these two proteolytic fragments comprise reasonable structural models for intact sTnC."

In an effort to understand the molecular basis for the tissue-specific regulation of mRNA-S14 expression, we have examined the organization of this gene in chromatin. Specifically, we examined the distribution of DNase I-hypersensitive sites and DNA methylation sites associated with a 25-kilobase chromosomal domain containing the S14 gene. Our results show that DNase I preferentially digests four regions of the DNA flanking the 5' end of the hepatic S14 gene which have characteristics of DNase I-hypersensitive sites. The sites, identified as HS-1, HS-2, HS-3, and HS-4, are located at or adjacent to the site of transcription initiation and at 1.2, 7, and 8 kilobases upstream from this site, respectively. In lactating mammary gland where the S14 gene is also highly expressed and regulated by L-triiodothyronine, sites HS-1, HS-2, and HS-4 are present, but HS-3 is absent. No hypersensitive sites were detected either within the gene or flanking the 3' end of the gene. In brain, kidney, and spleen, tissues in which mRNA-S14 is expressed at levels less than or equal to 10% of that found in euthyroid liver, sites HS-1 and HS-3 were absent. Despite the marked effect of thyroid state on the abundance of hepatic mRNA-S14, no significant alterations were observed in the DNase I sensitivity of hepatic chromatin containing the S14 gene. Analysis of the DNA methylation pattern at HpaII and HhaI sites showed a positive correlation of hypomethylation of the gene and the contiguous flanking regions with S14 gene expression. All HpaII/MspI sites and most HhaI sites either within or flanking the S14 gene were undermethylated in liver and lactating mammary gland. Although thyroid status had no generalized effect on the site-specific DNA methylation state of the hepatic S14 chromosomal domain, one site (H3) situated in the second exon close to the 3' terminus of the S14 gene appeared to undergo demethylation in the transition from hypo- to euthyroidism. In essence, our results show that the 5' DNA flanking region of the S14 gene contains a tissue-specific DNase I-hypersensitive site which, although not influenced by thyroid status, appears essential for the expression of S14 and its regulation by L-triiodothyronine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

This effect, which they called quaternary enhancement, is incompatible with the two-state Monod, Wyman, and Changeux allosteric model. Their free energy of binding of the fourth molecule (-9.3 kcal/mol) has been compared with independent kinetic estimates which give -8.6 kcal/mol.

We developed a method to chemically synthesize this glycolipid using a lactose unit, a ceramide unit, and two hexosamine donors as synthons and made the synthetic glycolipid available as an immunogen. The two monoclonal antibodies we obtained (YI328-18 and YI328-51, both IgG3) specifically recognized the novel branching structure and had no cross-reactivity with gangliotriaosylceramide or lactotriaosylceramide. Thus, the antibodies were found to be useful probes to detect lactogangliotetraosylceramide expressed in undifferentiated M1 leukemia cells, which disappears on induced differentiation.

The increase in specific activity (up to 2900-fold) indicated that the normal and protoporphyria enzymes were purified to a similar degree. The mutant enzyme had catalytic activity which was 10 to 15% of normal ferrochelatase, although the Michaelis constants for protoporphyrin and iron were similar. The molecular mass of the normal and protoporphyria enzyme protein was 40 kDa as evaluated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). In the presence of 15 mM sodium cholate, gel filtration demonstrated a similar size. However, at a lower concentration of sodium cholate (4 mM) the molecular mass was about 240 kDa, suggesting that the purified enzymes aggregate under this condition. Polyvalent antibodies were raised in rabbits using as antigens purified normal native enzyme and normal 40-kDa protein which had been further purified by preparative SDS-PAGE. In Western blots these antibodies complexed with both the normal and mutant 40-kDa proteins. The amount of 40-kDa protein in normal and protoporphyria mitochondrial fractions was also similar as evaluated by Western blots.

It is shown here to be an inhibitor of glycogen phosphorylase and to bind more tightly to the enzyme than the equivalent malto-oligosaccharide substrate. X-ray crystallographic studies of the acarbose-phosphorylase a complex in the presence of glucose and caffeine reveal the structure of acarbose as bound to the storage site of phosphorylase. The acarbose binds in an orientation such that the conduritol ring makes no protein contacts. As with malto-oligosaccharides bound at this site, the observed conformation of acarbose is stabilized by O-2-O-3' hydrogen bonding and is similar to, but not identical with, that predicted by hard-sphere exo-anomeric effect calculations and justified by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance studies (Bock, K., and Pedersen, H.

The uptake and metabolism of low density lipoprotein (LDL) in the mutant cells are defective. Accumulation of fluorescent-labeled LDL as well as internalization and degradation of 125I-LDL are greatly reduced in Monr-31 cells. The receptor number for LDL on the cell surface of Monr-31 is about one-third that for CHO cells, but affinity constants for both cell lines are similar. Electrophoretic analysis shows a slightly reduced molecular weight of LDL receptor in Monr-31 cells in comparison to that in CHO cells. The internalization index (internalization plus degradation per binding) of LDL of the mutant is about one-half that of CHO cells, suggesting a failure of internalization of LDL as well as LDL binding. Hybrids (hyb-1, -2, and -3) between CHO and Monr-31 cells show LDL binding and LDL internalization activities comparable to that of CHO cells, suggesting that the altered LDL response in Monr-31 cells is recessive. Addition of exogenous LDL to culture medium down-regulates the LDL receptor activity of CHO, hyb-2, and hyb-3 cells, whereas no such down-regulation is seen in Monr-31 cells. Probably as a result of the failure of down-regulation, the prominent inhibition of sterol synthesis from acetate and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase observed in CHO cells is scarcely detectable in Monr-31 cells. As a correlated result, sterol synthesis from acetate is 6-fold higher in the mutant. The failure of down-regulation of LDL receptors in Monr-31 cells is discussed in relation to the altered binding and internalization of LDL."
https://openalex.org/W1530614097,"Abstract Membrane ghosts derived from chromaffin vesicles of bovine adrenal medullas have been used to examine the mechanism of reduction of dopamine beta-monooxygenase in its compartmentalized state. The rate of the dopamine beta-monooxygenase-catalyzed conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine is greatly stimulated by the presence of ATP, reflecting substrate hydroxylation on the ghost interior subsequent to the active transport of dopamine. We demonstrate a 2-3-fold increase in the turnover rate for ghosts resealed with 0.2-2 mM potassium ferrocyanide, conditions leading to a slight decrease in the rate of dopamine transport. These data provide the first evidence that an intravesicular pool of reductant can activate dopamine beta-monooxygenase, as required by models in which vesicular ascorbate behaves as enzyme reductant. Although there is sufficient catecholamine (endogenous plus substrate) to keep internal ferrocyanide reduced in these experiments, an additional 2-3-fold increase in turnover occurs in the presence of 0.2-2 mM ascorbate on the ghost exterior. The magnitude of this activation is found to be constant at all concentrations of internal ferrocyanide (both below and above saturation), implying that reductants on opposite sides of the membrane behave independently. Replacement of ascorbate by potassium ferrocyanide as external reductant leads to almost identical results, and we are able to rule out an inward transport of dehydroascorbate as the source of activation by external ascorbate. We conclude that external reductants are capable of reducing membrane-bound dopamine beta-monooxygenase from the exterior face of the vesicle, either by direct reduction or through a membrane-bound mediator. It appears that two viable modes for reduction of dopamine beta-monooxygenase may exist in vivo, involving the reduction of membrane-bound enzyme by cytosolic ascorbate as well as the reduction of soluble enzyme by the pool of intravesicular ascorbate present in chromaffin vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1592553917,"The ligatin monomer is a polypeptide of Mr = 10,000 which is soluble in acidified chloroform:methanol, a characteristic similar to that of Folch-Lee proteolipid. The hydrophobicity of ligatin is also reflected by its ability to interpolate into the phosphatidylcholine bilayer as shown by a concentration-dependent change in membrane conductance. However, unlike other proteolipids the amino acid composition of ligatin is not enriched in hydrophobic amino acids (isoleucine, leucine, valine, methionine, phenylalanine, tryptophan). Instead, the hydrophobic character of ligatin could be explained, at least in part, by the covalent association of fatty acids, 1.4-1.7 mol of palmitate/10,000 g of protein, as revealed by gas chromatography mass spectrographic analyses. The post-translational addition of fatty acid may therefore be the means by which ligatin acquires an affinity for membranes."

Cell-to-cell diffusion of the fluorescent dye was not observed at pH 6.0. Full recovery occurred, however, when the pH of the extracellular medium was adjusted to 7.4. To provide a sensitive index of the averaged efficacy of junctional communication, we measured the number of cells that survived ouabain treatment in a 50% mixture of wild and ouabain-resistant mutant LLC-PK1 cells. Electron probe microanalysis in uncoupled cells showed that ouabain treatment produced two populations of cells, with totally different intracellular Na+ and K+ content. Under this condition, only 50% of the population survived after 48 h of treatment. When ouabain treatment was initiated 24 h after plating, however, 100% survival was observed, and the cells contained uniform intracellular Na+ and K+ concentration. This finding is consistent with the theory that this protective effect is mediated through the presence of the functional communicating intercellular junctions. When ouabain was applied at different times after plating, full protection is reached by 2 h. The early development of cell-to-cell communication, which precedes the development of the occluding junctions and several transport systems by several hours, is consistent with the involvement of the intercellular junctions in the synchronization of the polarization process."
